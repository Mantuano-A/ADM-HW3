    Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.<br />
<br />
The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281766">
        feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.<br />
<br />
One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.<br />
<br />
To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.<br />
<br />
No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements. <br />
<br />
With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously.<br />

    Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.<br />
<br />
The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281771">
        hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.<br />
<br />
The characters here are not really outstanding. There&#039;s no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples&#039; relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.<br />
<br />
The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it&#039;s just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don&#039;t think those tracks could fit anywhere).<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that&#039;s it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.

    Do you ever felt that you are getting tired of Romance Comedy Set in Highschool? When the troupe of this kind of slice of life romance comedies is starting to get boring? And as time passes, it starting to get very jarring to watch. When the idea is getting stale when nothing new is introduced on the table.<br />
<br />
If you feel that way? You’re not the only one. Because I am also growing kind of tired of this kind of show as I hit my late 20’s. The problem I see with this kind of show is that we get an ample amount of it every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408529">
        season with little to no variety amongst them that sometimes make the experience no longer engaging enough for me to care. But to be super clear I still enjoy watching high school rom-com every now and then, especially the very old ones. It’s just becoming much harder for me to try out new ones especially if I expect I am not getting the pay-off. And by the way, a lot of rom-com doesn’t end in a very satisfying way which ends up either make me wanting more or felt depressed.<br />
<br />
Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku is a show I consider, in my opinion, a breath of fresh air when it comes to the romance and slice of life genre. Sure, there are lots of anime featuring working young adults&#039; love story while some are more solid because the couples are already married. But if you going to count the memorable ones that heavily focus on the idea I mention. I think I cannot count them more than my ten fingers.<br />
<br />
In this Review, we are going to explore why I think this anime is good and fresh on what is presented in the year 2018. <br />
<br />
(Story/Plot/Writing) (7/10: Good) (Spoiler Free)<br />
<br />
The first thing that I found interesting in the anime is that the basic story is about characters living their normal young adult life with their hobbies co-existing with their current lifestyle. The catch in the formula however is that they also have to build and maintain upon an established romantic relationship with their partners. <br />
<br />
For young audiences who haven’t been involved in this kind of stage of their life as a working adult will find it kind of boring and unrelatable. But for me currently as a young adult on the writing of this review found it very common around the office. People balancing work and relationships is a challenge by itself.  <br />
<br />
I find it fascinating that characters are realistically self-aware about the public mentality against otaku culture, they are not ignorant about it. Even though the approach is quite different for each character. There is a sense of realism about it.  <br />
<br />
Most of the time, on other anime I’ve seen but not all, heavily glorified “Otaku Culture’’ as some kind of magnificent way of life that society failed to understand. They victimized otakus as an undesirable group of people that society failed to understand. Giving the notion that Otakus are ”Special” and the “Real World”’ is a stupid place, only Isekai’s will understand them. The show is quite subtle in showcasing a sneak peek at how otakus enjoy their niche hobbies in a very down-to-earth way. No exaggeration or Hyperbole involve. Just regular people doing the things they love.<br />
<br />
Ok, we cover why I found the core synopsis interesting, now let’s move on to the comedy aspect of the show. The show makes use of some really funny inside jokes about certain otaku habits. And I am surprised that the gag is only used in small amounts. Usually, in rom-com with otaku-related humor, we commonly get like 10 or more of the referential jokes each episode. But in Wotakoi&#039;s case, there are only lesser than anticipated per episode if I remember correctly. related to jokes that might be niche jokes that only certain groups of people will get the reference. Jokes that only otaku knows sort of things. The show relies on basic office humor and your typical slice of life rom-com humor that any non-otakus person can understand. I found this style pretty nice. Less is more. The more time I can breathe between jokes the better. I am not a fan of comedies that loves to bombards 10 to 20 random jokes within the span of 1 to 5 minutes. Looking at you Pani Poni Dash!<br />
<br />
The humor is well-paced in the majority of each episode. It has a good transition from serious mood to light-hearted or awkward mood to relatable feel-good moments. Though emotional whiplash exists in this show, it is not too damaging enough to destroy the overall experience.<br />
<br />
Now we are done with the core aspect of the show comedy. Let’s talk about the show main spice in the story, the romance. If I am going to rank the character&#039;s level of relationship on the scale of 1 to 10. I say they are between a 6 or 7, depending on how far you look at the depth of the romance. I say the character&#039;s mutual attraction to one another and how they behave is realistically normal. The romance of the show is more slice of life than heartwarming romantic. <br />
It doesn’t shy away from the reality that a romantic relationship is not all about flowers and sex. Most of the time you will just see characters having a mundane conversation about each other’s lives, hanging around in each other’s houses, watching movies, and playing videos games. Doing dates that don’t seem to be super fun as other people romanticize it. And for me that’s Ok. A relationship is all about sharing life experiences and personal stories to their partners that they wouldn’t honestly talk about to other people.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all about being comfortable being yourself. Doing what you love around the person you love and you are proudly supported every step of the way. And to me, that’s pure romance at its core.<br />
<br />
(Characters, Only Main to Talk About) (7/10 Good) (Spoiler-Free)<br />
<br />
I usually talk about each individual character on their pro and cons when a show has a limited scope of less than 6 acting casts. But I decided just to highlights some very significant general traits to avoid giving up some major spoilers. That show doesn’t have an overarching plot. Most episodes can be very independent of one another. The enjoyment and the main content of Wotakoi can offer is the main character themselves. Just to give you guys the idea.<br />
<br />
People should know that otakus are not set as a single stereotype. There is a multitude of different niche groups of otakus with varying interests and hobbies. Hirotaka, Narumi, Hanako, and Tarou present the message that not all otakus have an aligned set of interests. Even though Narumi and Hanako almost shared the same interest but they have different opinions and perspectives on specific topics like most individuals within a fandom. Not very stereotypical. This makes each character stand out in their own right and not getting overshadowed by another.<br />
<br />
When it comes to conflict and relationship hurdles. The format is quite similar to Boy VS Girl squabbles. As I mentioned recently the show remains consistently light-hearted and never sway too much on more serious adult theme boundaries. And there is no antagonizing character either in this show so expect there will be no serious dispute will occur in this show.  <br />
<br />
I also found the small cast of characters very fun to watch since I like the relationship dynamics with a combination ok humor. <br />
<br />
(Technical Stuff) (Art &amp; Animation 7/10)( Music and Sound Design 7/10)<br />
<br />
I only gonna make this section a little short since there isn’t anything much to talk about. The Opening &quot;Fiction by Sumika is enjoyable to watch every episode. Good OST Ambience on particular scenarios has some very relaxing vibes to it. And the Ending Music is Good too. <br />
<br />
For a modern anime made in 2018, I would say the animation and art style is quite standard, nothing special. Not always being flashy nor super hyperbolic nonsense all the time. The style plays out very maturely most of the time. For Slice of Life Anime About Adults, I think the art style is good for the show in general. And for small details, the “Lighting” and “Shadowing” are quite good too. <br />
<br />
(Enjoyment/ Bias Personal Opinion) (7/10 I have Fun Watching This Show) (W/Spoilers)<br />
<br />
I’ve been telling a lot of positives about the show but I would like to discuss some of my little complaints about it in this section though they aren’t that many. This issue I found in the show might be not a negative to others.<br />
<br />
Introducing some new character in mid-way is ok but in the last few episodes, I considered a foul play in regard to character introduction. And Wotakoi actually did this kind of tactic which I found kind of annoying since this anime didn’t get a season 2 to fix the sudden introduction of the character. Until now I don’t remember him/her very much because of lack of screen time.<br />
<br />
The character &quot;Fleshing Out&#039;&#039; is Good but there isn’t any deep development or change on the characters. But I would like to counterargument that each character does establish to know each other’s interest and dislike over the course of the series which still made them organic until the end. And can you blame them? There isn’t any major conflict in this show that will force them to change their ways. And that is fine for a slice of life Rom-Com. But it also filled me the void of wanting it more and I might check out the source material in the future.<br />
<br />
(Final Thoughts) (Overall 7/10 A show worth recommending to specific niche)    <br />
<br />
The show did a good job of presenting a basic slice of life romance story of your modern office worker that has a niche interest. It didn’t go deep into any heavy themes and stay consistently light-hearted to the majority of the 11-episode run. I like the way this show doesn’t represent otakus as creepy pedophilic rapists or pathetic basement dwellers. The show presents them as normal human beings who live a healthy life. It doesn’t make you feel sorry for them or feel disgusted if a person has a distinct interest in anime, games, or stuff people will find disturbing.<br />
 <br />
I will also conclude that this show is not for everybody but I believe that people&#039;s preferences change over time depending on our age and our environment. So you might not appreciate this kind of show now but maybe someday you will. <br />
 <br />
Like the show once said. I used to be Pure. I wasn’t born as a boob guy.<br />
 <br />
Closing Remarks:<br />
 <br />
If I have the chance to describe the show overall using specific character dialogues this is what I choose.<br />
 <br />
Narumi Momose to Hirotoka Nifuji:<br />
 <br />
 &gt;My last boyfriend, and the one before that, and my first boyfriend were all the same.<br />
 <br />
 &gt;They all dumped me because I was an Otaku. It is always like that for me. It was always like that, so this feels easy for me now! I don’t have to hide the fact that I am a nerd. <br />
 <br />
 &gt;But Neither of us is the other’s ideal type. We are both otakus. I am sure we’re both making some compromises. <br />
<br />
Hirotaka Nifuji Reply to Narumi Momose:<br />
<br />
&gt; Well you’re right, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t compromising on anything. <br />
<br />
&gt;I’m not with you just because you’re a nerd or just because it’s easy.<br />
<br />
&gt;I love seeing you do the things you like.<br />
<br />
&gt;Anyway that’s how I feel<br />
<br />
 End of Conversation<br />
 <br />
<br />
And Always Thanks for Reading Guys! Peace Out!<br />

    Welcome to the latest &quot;what if a bunch of generic teenagers were adults&quot; anime. Let’s see what Japan has served up this time… Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Well, at least it has an interesting name, it’d be even more interesting if the show had stayed true to it for at least a single episode. It didn’t, and by the end of the first episode, the main characters are already dating.<br />
<br />
Okay, that one misgiving aside, Wotakoi is a decent workplace romantic comedy with plenty of good qualities but is ultimately weighed down by poor comedic timing. Let’s first discuss what the show does well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281767">
        before diving into the issues.<br />
<br />
The characters are all fairly likable, while I never found any one of them to be great, their chemistry with one another is enjoyably infectious. With a premise like otakus falling in love, characterizing it’s cast in a believable and relatable way is where the show’s main success lies. For example, the lead character Narumi is a fujoshi and likely the most otaku of the four lead characters, yet she’s never made into a caricature. Cutesy mannerism and a little pigeon-toed running aside, her hobbies seem realistic and aren’t at the butt end of jokes. It’s the same with her co-worker Koyanagi, she’s a reasonably restrained fujo in public, but a well-known cosplayer at conventions. In the first few episodes, she and Narumi slowly learn about their hobbies because you can’t just dive headlong into the subject of BL with your co-workers unless you want to get a permanent side-eye from them. And Wotakoi handles this extremely well, otaku being sort of oddballs have to exercise self-restraint when talking about their hobbies. When they meet other otakus with similar tastes, it’s like they’ve finally found people who speak their own language. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s an ideal foundation for a rom-com about otakus dating, but the lead pairing Narumi and Hirotaka already have known each other for years before they start working together, so it feels like it&#039;s not such a struggle for them to be in love. Unless if you consider the &#039;love is hard&#039; to be referring to the glacial progression of the romance then I suppose it&#039;s faithful to the title. <br />
About half of the show’s screen time is spent in the office space like a typical work comedy, and the other half is on dates and drinking parties just to keep it fresh, but it&#039;s a romcom so a threadbare story structure is inevitable. What&#039;s really important is the characters, not story, but that doesn&#039;t excuse Wotakoi&#039;s stagnant narrative, which we&#039;ll discuss more in depth after the positives.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s cast being otakus makes them better, rather than being cringely portrayed like you may expect from its ilk, it&#039;s well done and relatable. The game otaku Hirotaka (and Narumi’s childhood friend) plays and references plenty of games without it feeling forced or tacked on. If the group is going to play Mario Kart, the scene isn’t about slamming the viewer over the head with Mario jokes, but the people playing the game. Good otaku representation is always ideal in a series like this because it helps the characters to feel relatable and fills in the gaps in their characterization. And that brings us to the issues. Aside from the characters being portrayed well for the archetypes that they fill, there is very little to them as people. It feels like they selected standard romcom archetypes, mixed them with otaku archetypes, then left the characters then forgot to add much depth leaving them as placeholders for actual people. We know the bare minimum about their personalities for them to function in a romcom. There the cutesy but occasionally oblivious Narumi, the stoic deadpan Hirotaka, as well as Koyonogi&#039;s air of confidence and cleverness, and the abrasive tsundere dude Kabakura. <br />
<br />
There’s not much great character development at all. When the show gets into backstories and motivates it only goes skin deep then backs off as if it’s afraid to tell us too much about the cast. Like the scene with Hirotaka telling Narumi about his ear piercing because the guy she was dating at the time had pierced ears as well. It was kindhearted and subtle flirting like Hirotaka tends to do throughout most of the series, with Narumi being typically oblivious or sometimes considering maybe she does love the guy she’s dating. Hirotaka and Narumi flirting is comparable to trying to carve an ice sculpture with a pencil, there’s barely any momentum and the characters hardly grow by the end. It doesn’t help that the show is still adding characters by the tenth episode to digress from the lead couple. <br />
<br />
The characters are still quite watchable despite these flaws because the show&#039;s writing doesn&#039;t travel far outside of its comfort zone to create a well-rounded experience. It&#039;s a series with no noticeably bad moments, just plenty of meh ones. Wotakoi is sadly an example of; succeeding only because it did not try hard enough to risk failure. <br />
<br />
From a technical perspective, the characters are at least well designed, passionately voiced, and their hobbies are realistically detailed, and they do have chemistry. Seeing arguments that Kyabakura and Koyanagi have over BL and yuri feels like they understand their own opinions greatly like the author was pulling from real people’s experience. If only the joke delivery capitalized on the chemistry’s potential, it could have been better. The romance between the two main characters is quite stagnant, but sadly the comedy is also affected by its own pacing problems. The pacing is slow and the jokes don’t hit with much impact. Looking at how the manga delivers jokes, it&#039;s much funnier and flows better. This adaptation just feels like a moving manga, there is no consideration for pacing or how it will animate. What likely caused this is a lacking budget and a director not talented enough to improve the source material in any way. <br />
<br />
For example; sometimes we’re slapped with an intentionally unfunny joke from the po-faced Hirotaka and they just hang on screen for a painful few seconds that feel more like an hour, grinding the scene’s pace to a halt. That’s the pace of a majority of the jokes, with very little animation aside from funny reaction faces (taken from the manga). Every joke is presented with a slow lethargic pace that makes the director seem like he has no concept of how to time a joke properly. That brings us to the show’s production issues. Ok, to be fair, the op is really well done. It’s dynamic, well edited, and offers plenty of details on the character’s personalities. <br />
<br />
The main cast having anime colored hair to help them stand out from the background is a bit jarring considering the blandness of their work environment. Speaking of which, often times it seems like the four leads are the only ones who work at the company. It’s partially excusable when they’re in a relatively small 6 cubicle office space. When wacky hijinks ensue and the four of them are running all throughout the building I can’t help but wonder if A-1 couldn’t spare the animation or if the writer couldn’t make the jokes funny enough without having to unrealistically remove all of the background characters. I suppose it’s better than the CGI crowds the show regularly uses. The end result is still somewhat funny if a bit unrealistic if only it didn’t bend the audience’s suspension of disbelief to get to the comedy. It’s scenes like this that make you wonder if the show would have been better if it were adapted by a different studio. <br />
<br />
Ah, if you noticed that I skipped over Kabakura when talking about what I liked about the characters, that was intentional. I think he’s a jerk who treats Hanako like an asshole then occasionally makes it up to her by doing one nice thing. The friction between him and Hanako actually gave the show a chance to explore that theme of love being hard for otaku, but instead, the conflict is reduced to: they’re together because they always have been. That itself is a message, that otaku don’t have many options, but it’s not a dynamic that you can just sweep under the rug. It should have been discussed because relationships like that do have negative effects on those involved, but like I mentioned there’s no discussion it’s just &quot;oh I’m sorry, have this gift and we’ll go back to normal&quot;. They had some nicer scenes in the later half of the show, with them discussing yaoi versus yuri, and it’s genuinely nice. But it needed to be more than just moderately pleasant, there needed to be more substance or at least effective comedy. <br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
[Story: 6/10] Nice themes, very little progression.<br />
[Art: 7/10] Great character designs, lackluster direction.<br />
[Sound: 7/10] Vivid opening, passionate performances.<br />
[Character: 6/10] Likable and well portrayed, lacking characterization.<br />
[Enjoyment: 6/10] Funny reaction faces, poorly timed jokes.<br />
[Love Hardness Level: Easy]<br />
<br />
[Final Score: 6.4/10]<br />
Having relatable and uplifting themes is great, but a show should still be compelling on its own and that’s where Wotakoi disappoints. The characters are likable for their strong personalities and in-depth hobbies, but they lack the development needed to be truly memorable. Even if the jokes weren&#039;t timed so poorly, this series is still lacking, but it sure could have helped if they hired a director with a better understanding of comedic timing.

    I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn&#039;t fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it&#039;s obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it&#039;s entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281768">
        think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it&#039;s cute, but because it&#039;s unique, it&#039;s fun, and of course, it&#039;s got everything else going for it. <br />
<br />
I mean, look at it&#039;s competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it&#039;s cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it&#039;s second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can&#039;t compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!<br />
<br />
First off, it&#039;s a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can&#039;t find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it&#039;s watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it&#039;s because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you&#039;re single or with your partner. Even though it&#039;s centered on Otakus, it&#039;s biggest feature is that there&#039;s something for everyone. <br />
<br />
Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I&#039;m just talking about the normies here, if you&#039;re a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There&#039;s lots to list and I don&#039;t have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don&#039;t think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it&#039;s dance and there&#039;s been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that&#039;s not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it&#039;s an excellent example of a testament to the anime. <br />
<br />
And we&#039;ve barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven&#039;t seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn&#039;t get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn&#039;t overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn&#039;t a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn&#039;t at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way. <br />
<br />
I might be sounding like I&#039;m fanboying like crazy but let&#039;s just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you&#039;re left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I&#039;d call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It&#039;s got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don&#039;t have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don&#039;t want another group to come after me so I won&#039;t give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They&#039;re dating from the first episode itself and they&#039;re adults and they&#039;re Otakus. Reasons enough for why it&#039;s so fantastic? <br />
<br />
Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven&#039;t even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She&#039;s cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they&#039;re very much main characters as well since they&#039;re a main focus of the anime too! And that&#039;s not to mention the other supporting cast too, they&#039;re cute too and the biggest part is that even though they&#039;re a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can&#039;t find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute. <br />
<br />
STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it&#039;s synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I&#039;m talking from the perspective of people who don&#039;t like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun. <br />
Coming back to the topic, it&#039;s artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you&#039;re watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it&#039;s artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it&#039;s comedy didn&#039;t hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had. <br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you&#039;re a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn&#039;t too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :P<br />
<br />
You and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you&#039;ll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we&#039;re all Otakus aren&#039;t we?<br />
<br />
P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it&#039;s inclusive despite it&#039;s otaku centered focus. Hirotaka GO!

    I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.<br />
<br />
‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.<br />
<br />
The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279698">
        Tarou.<br />
<br />
If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.<br />
<br />
ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there&#039;s that!<br />

    Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don&#039;t acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don&#039;t even hug or share a kiss? I don&#039;t know about you, but I have had enough!<br />
<br />
I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, I tried watching the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279921">
        episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard! <br />
<br />
A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn&#039;t dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full. <br />
<br />
I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better. <br />
<br />
The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two &#039;otaku&#039; couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it&#039;s the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting. <br />
<br />
This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn&#039;t have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.<br />

    Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.  <br />
<br />
Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279734">
        just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their &#039;hardships&#039; and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation. <br />
<br />
Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too.

    I&#039;m surprised there aren&#039;t more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark. <br />
<br />
Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn&#039;t require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279912">
        The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people&#039;s eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn&#039;t funny or sweet purely through the &quot;nerd-culture&quot; content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost. <br />
<br />
I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There&#039;s so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you&#039;re looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume&#039;s anime walks all over this.

    What makes a good romcom anime?<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Comedy<br />
<br />
Narrative<br />
<br />
Relationships<br />
<br />
Drama<br />
<br />
Romance<br />
<br />
Theses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.<br />
<br />
3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282536">
        romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.<br />
<br />
Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.<br />
<br />
So what made this romcom so great you may ask?<br />
<br />
You gonna to find out soon enough.<br />
<br />
Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let&#039;s get started.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
<br />
The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.<br />
<br />
I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.<br />
<br />
For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku&#039;s but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.<br />
Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that&#039;s goes along.<br />
The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it&#039;s references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etc<br />
The one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn&#039;t take place at high school. Don&#039;t get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.<br />
<br />
Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.<br />
<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.<br />
Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn&#039;t tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won&#039;t do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.<br />
Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.<br />
The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.<br />
Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.<br />
Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it&#039;s nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it&#039;s not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.<br />
The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.<br />
Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.<br />
The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.<br />
<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.<br />
The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.<br />
Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.<br />
If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.<br />
Final Score 8.5/10

    Honestly, I&#039;m sure If I should do a full review on this anime, just because it feels like there is more to come. It ended on such a weird note and it made you feel like there was another episode to watch after 11.<br />
<br />
However, considering that this was a fairly recent anime and the world as we all know is going through a pandemic, it can be fairly difficult to release more episodes since it takes a considerable amount of time to draw and animate adaptations from a manga.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way lemme break down why I have given &quot;Wotakoi: Love is Hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401383">
        for Otaku&quot; a 10/10.<br />
<br />
Story - 10/10<br />
Firstly, growing up from a kid to an adult can be scary and also exciting at the same time. We all have our own favorite hobbies, interests, or that dirty little secret that you just want to keep quiet about, and believe me I have few secrets which I would never share with anyone, no matter who they are.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, people don&#039;t like to admit it but it&#039;s part of our society and how we live in. This anime essentially touches on that topic, the English translation of the title is &quot;It&#039;s Difficult to Love an Otaku&quot; which if your living underneath a rock essentially means it&#039;s difficult to find love while you personally love all things anime and manga-related.<br />
<br />
Bring in characters that are exactly like that and work together in an office can bring an interesting storyline on what a possible scenario outcome would be. Welcome to a story of office romance, finding love, and a strong culture of otakus and gamers.<br />
<br />
Now, for those who watch anime and read manga on a daily basis, you can heavily relate to this show as it can be hard to find love or a potential relationship if someone like you watches this kind of thing. Opening up about this sort of topic can tell a lot about your personality and sharing it with friends can be a difficult experience too. You have no idea how your friend might react once they know you like watching anime and reading manga. Some people would take it and blow it out of proportion and make fun of you, call you names, and eventually that friendship would fizzle, it&#039;s the same sort of thing if you had a girlfriend/boyfriend, and during this anime one character by the name of Narumi, Momose had that exact same experience and her relationship with her boyfriend, it fizzled then died. She then, therefore, vowed to herself that she would keep her love for anime and manga a secret and would never share it with anyone unless they like the same thing.<br />
<br />
This anime&#039;s story was truly sweet, cute, funny, and quirky at the same time. The plot twists were fairly minimal and you can follow the story of a relationship-building between Hirotaka and Narumi.<br />
<br />
Art - 9/10<br />
As always, the art was truly well done. The design of the characters looked great, but I guess it took me a while to adjust to the eyes of certain characters, but only because most of the other anime&#039;s I have watched, the character&#039;s eyes were big and bold.<br />
I did however get used to it but anything slightly different than the eye design in this anime would kinda put me off.<br />
However, overall, the art and surroundings were superb and it really set the tone well.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10<br />
Fabulous, nothing else much to say. The opening was so catchy and so cheery it was perfect to hum along to when starting a new episode and that ending theme, my god, was utterly brilliant. I have even edited that soundtrack and turned it into a mobile phone/cell phone ringtone, it is that good. Of course, the soundtracks within the anime complemented all the scenes really well.<br />
<br />
Character - 10/10<br />
I think I&#039;ve covered most of this section in the art and story sections but I guess I could say a few words here and try not to repeat myself. The character&#039;s in this anime were truly well portrayed and it made an all-around enjoyable experience to watch. The personality&#039;s of the characters were really interesting to learn about;<br />
:- a girl with an obsessed love interest for anime and manga.<br />
:- a boy who loves gaming and would not eat, drink or sleep during a vacation and just keep playing his games.<br />
:- a girl who loves cosplaying as a guy (very interesting indeed, I wonder how she hid those humungous hungolomghnonoloughongous) while she was cosplaying.<br />
and finally<br />
:- a guy who likes watching anime and reading manga<br />
<br />
It made the entire story and experience of this anime and really enjoyable one, I just wish there were more episodes, but I guess it&#039;s the waiting game now, hmmm.<br />
<br />
Overall - 10/10<br />
This anime was really good and I really enjoyed it, I would like to thank all my otaku friends for recommending me this anime, a solid choice and yes I would recommend this anime to all my friends who haven&#039;t seen it.<br />
<br />
Well, that pretty much sum&#039;s up my review for &quot;Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku&quot;, if more episodes come out, I might add more but for now, time to watch another anime.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for reading if you got this far, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.<br />

    Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren&#039;t very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to &quot;yes, I am a vegan&quot; meme. Pretty cool. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don&#039;t hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don&#039;t spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279686">
        that feel very accurate to 90&#039;s kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main characters don&#039;t feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series. <br />
<br />
<br />
At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that. <br />
<br />
<br />
The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.

    Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver. <br />
<br />
It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293777">
        You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.<br />
<br />
Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple. <br />
<br />
I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.<br />

    Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That&#039;s it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010&#039;s sparking a big genre called &#039;&#039;School&#039;&#039;.<br />
Yet Im not talking about the &#039;&#039;School&#039;&#039; genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say &#039;&#039;How in the world does this four have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281776">
        a partner with their attitudes?&#039;&#039;. <br />
<br />
The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our &#039;&#039;in-real-life&#039;&#039; adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I&#039;m not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.<br />
<br />
Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don&#039;t need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.

    Wotakoi is light romantic comedy of responsible adults connected by the threads of their hobby--otaku culture. The cast are adults in the workplace that were able to come together because of their common interests: games, anime, manga, and cosplay. The series draws us to the feeling of making friends that we can share our interests (ones that we do not readily share to most our friends.) <br />
The animation is adequately pleasant. The opening theme is very catchy, it had me look up on sumika--and now they are a staple on my music playlist.<br />
<br />
The characters and their interactions are enjoyable. Particularly, Narumi and Hirotaka&#039;s relationship and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340736">
        how they progressed is very cute. It is something we would ponder on--dating our best friend. Starting out as childhood friends, Narumi would find it difficult to have a partner that would accept her interests. Reluctant at first, Narumi and Hirotaka got together, although in a comedic take. We would see Narumi enjoy being able to freely express her hobbies. The interesting part is how they try to figure out how to act &quot;normal&quot; in a relationship, and I see that as something amazing to see that they do not have to force it and just be themselves.<br />
<br />
Overall, the series mixes comedy, romance, and drama very well--not too much, just enough.

    This anime is simply put a fine piece of soul-soothing.<br />
<br />
This is no CGDCT and for that I&#039;m honestly thankful, being able to create relatable situations and hilarious jokes and references to otaku culture. <br />
<br />
The emphasis it puts on corporal environment, the overall anxiety of fitting in and the enjoyment of our hobbies it&#039;s simply amazing and present in every episode so far without outshining the romance of our characters which I absolutely adore.<br />
<br />
Every character has their unique traits and the amazing choice of voice actors helps them in that regard giving that punchline neccesary to make the humor of the series get to you.<br />

It&#039;s a

    This anime was honestly kinda boring and disappointing. I started this anime because they said it was a funny romance anime so I had pretty high expectations for this. But it was everything but romance. So if you like romance I wouldn&#039;t recommend this.<br />
<br />
The first episodes were good and enjoyable, but it went down real quick. There is actually no story and it felt very repetitive. The only thing they do is go to work and go drinking. The characters were all shallow and they needed more characterization. The first couple was almost always fighting and I get that that&#039;s the joke, but it became

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370982">
        boring very fast. The second, and i suppose the main couple, was so boring as well. They literally made an agreement to go out, but I still supposed and hoped there love was gonna develop. But that was not the case. Their conversations were so dull. It was already the last episode and all they did was kiss once and they went on a date, that was also interrupted by the other couple. When I finished the last episode I was so disappointed and the only thing I thought was; where was the love? The ending was so bad and their was no development at all. The art and the sound were good; the opening song is very joyful, so i have nothing bad to say about that.<br />
<br />
Overall I still gave this a decent 6/10. Also, please don&#039;t forget that this is just my opinion.

    This show is very true to the manga it is based on. It is a genuine slice of life anime that showcases the romantic relationship of two couples (maybe three if it gets another season). It doesn&#039;t have any petty jealousy that most romance shows have and focuses on the developing relationship of two childhood friends instead (with a ton of otaku references). I agree with Kabakura that Ranka is the best! (Macross F reference). Because it was fairly mature and not childish, I really enjoyed it. The studio also did a great job on their game graphics whenever they were shown! It made it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353740">
        even more realistic to me. You will probably relate to a lot of things in this anime if you like games, anime, manga, collectibles, and more! I say give it a chance and then go read the manga. There is just one more volume that needs to be published in English (technically two, but they do two in one).

    TL;DR It&#039;s a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don&#039;t think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don&#039;t like Romantic-Comedies.<br />
<br />
Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I&#039;m just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281779">
        making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...<br />
<br />
BUT THAT&#039;S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff. <br />
<br />
Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending. <br />
<br />
Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don&#039;t think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It&#039;s an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.

    I&#039;ll preface this by saying that I have not read any of the manga for this series. <br />
<br />
You don&#039;t necessarily expect much to happen in a slice of life type show, but with Wotakoi, there is very little payoff. It all ends up feeling incredibly flat; each episode follows its own structure and there isn’t much of an overarching story being built. Everything is just enjoyable enough to keep you strung along hoping that something will eventually happen. And, it’s not to say that the characters don’t sometimes have their moments. There are cute interactions or jokes that land here and there, but the frequency

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307420">
        isn’t high enough to warrant a higher rating than a 5/10 for me.<br />
<br />
The romance is absolutely subdued here, and it doesn&#039;t really feel like much of a focus at all most of the time. Essentially, it just feels as though the show doesn&#039;t really know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a slice of life about 4 otaku nerds working in the same office? Or does the series want to try to explore a clumsy nerdy romance between two childhood friends? The show never seems to extend very far beyond: “These MCs are nerds! Wow aren’t they awkward and relatable? They’re so interested in vidya, manga and anime, perhaps like you, the viewer?” <br />
<br />
Ultimately, where this particular anime struggles is the character development. The characters are likable, but don&#039;t expect them to change much at all from the first episode to the last. Other romance anime do a better job of developing the relationship between the primary protagonists. However, this show really likes to emphasize that otaku lack social skills, which accomplishes about as much as you might think. This show truly is a slice of life at its core, and going in expecting more than that may leave you disappointed. <br />
A personal gripe for me was that a side character, Kou, is introduced far too late into the series. I really would have loved to see more of her, but there simply wasn’t enough time in an 11 episode timeframe. It was cute, and a romance could have easily bloomed there.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a very average anime, propped up by largely forgettable, bland characters. But hey, the characters are nice to look at, and most of the voice acting is well done. At least it’s cute! <br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 3<br />
Art - 6<br />
Sound - 7<br />
Character - 4<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
