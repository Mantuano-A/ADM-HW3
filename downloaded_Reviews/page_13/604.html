    When it was initially released, Macross: Do You Remember Love? was a benchmark by which other anime films would be judged. Its beautiful, detailed animation holds up even today, over 20 years later. This is in no small part due to the always gorgeous work of character designer Mikimoto Haruhiko, and now-legendary mechanical designer Kawamori Shoji.<br />
<br />
In comparison to the TV series, Do You Remember Love? solves a lot of the problems people have with it. The animation holds up much better. There are no shortcuts or sudden drops in quality due to budget constraints. In addition, the movie format cuts a lot of the slower

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5700">
        parts of the story that put off some fans. The pace is much more consistent, and downtime is minimal.<br />
<br />
On the downside, the shorter format sends any development of minor characters out the window. Roy and Claudia&#039;s relationship, Max and Milia&#039;s relationship, all personality of Kanzaki, the bridge bunnies, and all of the Zentradi... these aspects are all greatly cut back if not gone altogether. This is a typical consequence of converting TV series to feature film format, so it&#039;s not something one can hold against Do You Remember Love. However, you will feel a better connection to these characters if you&#039;ve seen the TV series first.<br />
<br />
The music utilizes many of Minmay&#039;s songs from the TV series, with the addition of the title track &amp;quot;Do You Remember Love?&amp;quot; The song itself becomes a major plot point, and at about 9 minutes in length plays over the whole climactic battle sequence. Iijima Mari was also propelled into pop stardom in her own right due to the mainstream popularity of the single.<br />
<br />
I definitely recommend Do You Remember Love? to anyone interested in the Macross franchise, as well as anyone interested in the best of 80&#039;s anime.

    Macross: Do You Remember Love? is like a future fairy tale. You have to have a cold heart, a jaded soul to not be touched by this glittering lovers&#039; fantasy. It&#039;s as cool and stylish as it is hopelessly romantic. It has some of the best traditional animation you&#039;ll ever see, and a truly classic look to everything from the machines; to the settings; to the abstract, dreamy, ephemeral backdrops that the characters sometimes sing or talk in front of when emotions are running high; to the characters themselves. The battle for love takes place among the twinkling stars that guide and cross the characters&#039;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405528">
        fates. I&#039;ll admit, I first tried to watch this film years ago after giving up on the series a few episodes in. I gave up on the film, too, feeling a bit incredulous toward the on the nose representation of a battle between the power of love, embodied by humanity, and the force of unfeeling, unconscious war and conquest represented by dorky, monumental green aliens, one of whom has a giant pulsating brain-head. The aliens are horrified by the fact that human (aka miclone) men and women live together, and even more horrified by the fact that they hug and KISS. Don&#039;t make me yack de culture!<br />
<br />
I mean, although it gets to be a little more complicated than that, the premise is a little silly. No one can really deny that. But it wouldn&#039;t be such a great, modern, scifi fairytale if it were otherwise. Isn&#039;t the moral of the story equally obvious in, say, Cinderella, or Beauty and the Beast? A work of art, which as far as anime go, this one undeniably is; isn&#039;t meant to be flawless, but to carry something inside it that transcends its flaws. So when I returned to this film for the second time with a few dozen more anime under my belt, and growing weary of approaching everything with a calculating, serious critical eye all of time, I came back to Do You Remember Love? with a bit more patience, and a rather more open heart. By the end of the story, my heart was fully in bloom.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll keep my analysis short this time, but there will be some spoilers as usual.<br />
<br />
Although I have been pretty firm so far about my characterization of this story as a fairy tale, I think it&#039;s worth noting that even though the day is seemingly saved and everything is ostensibly reconciled with a fairytale conclusion, at the end of this story, what it seems to say about the future of the human race and the power of culture is not all that tidy, and not without any traces of suspicion. <br />
<br />
The premise of Macross reminds me in a few ways of Evangelion, though obviously, it predates Eva by quite some time. Whereas Adam is the progenitor of humans (indirectly) and Angels in Evangelion, the Protoculture generates the Zentradi/Meltrandi and humans alike in Macross. Like in Evangelion, the humans in Macross do battle with a species that, little do they know, is not totally Other, but a mirroring of itself, despite how incomprehensible or hideous they may seem. Then, ultimately, the tool used to &quot;defeat&quot; the Zentradi and apparently end warfare is a popular love song from deep in the Protoculture&#039;s past. But what is the actual effect of this love song? <br />
<br />
The climax of the film, which takes place during Minmay&#039;s rendition of the song, is a battle. The song unites the Zentradi, Meltrandi and humans against a faction of the Zentradi that is resistant to acceptance of &quot;culture,&quot; culture being, defined by the Zentradi themselves, &quot;productive creative acts not related to warfare.&quot; Minmay&#039;s music is an example of culture. Yet the love song that saves the day is merely a call to arms that unites once quarreling forces against a common foe. It&#039;s a battle cry. The Zentrandi remark at the end of the film upon how there are 1000s of fleets left to destroy, but one says to the other &quot;Still, look at what one song was able to accomplish?&quot; What the song accomplished was the utter annihilation of their foe. Culture, according to the narrative, is a powerful weapon.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the story, Minmay uses her music to help her fans forget their sorrow. Later, she uses a forgotten pop song to unite everyone&#039;s hearts against those who refuse to join in the union. Music, for all the good it seems to accomplish, seems nevertheless to function as a kind of analgesic mind control tool. What does that say about the fact that the song that had the immense power to turn the tides of battle was just a pop song, of the type of music that comes a dime a dozen on radio broadcasts and streaming platforms that we, the viewers, listen to without a second thought day in and day out? What does that say about this movie, a piece of pop culture itself? Do we take what we take in for granted? Should we be as careful as we are grateful with regards to how we let the cultural artifacts we embrace affect our hearts?<br />
<br />
After all, the humans at the end of the story haven&#039;t eradicated war. They haven&#039;t eliminated lovers&#039; quarrels. A sometimes bitter love triangle is at the heart of the story. They&#039;ve survived the apocalypse, but conflict remains. Minmay is love that cannot be hidden, but she is pure performance. She cannot articulate the words for herself. Hayase has the heart of love beating inside of her, but she cannot present herself as a woman, as affectionate. At the end of the story, they&#039;ve reconciled. They restore love to its rightful place by reconstructing an old forgotten song together, content and performance. But as they do, the Zetrandi fly off to eradicate anyone else who would stand against Culture. Content and performance. The &quot;protoculture&quot; world has, in essence, been restored, and while it&#039;s a beautiful, triumphant moment, that&#039;s really all it can be. The city has risen from beneath the earth. We remember love. But what we remember, we can easily forget again, and perhaps we are doomed to. Then we&#039;ll remember again.

    I just saw this for the first time, 20+ years after production and I am seriously impressed with this reinterpretation. I was/am a Minmay hater. She was the main reason why I couldn&#039;t get into the Macross tv series. But, she&#039;s actually likeable in this version. You almost can&#039;t hate her. <br />
<br />
What I really enjoyed about this version is Misa Hayase&#039;s softer/vulnerable side.  I think her sensitivity wasn&#039;t as obvious in the Robotech Macross series (or maybe my memory is just fuzzy because it was a long time ago). Here, while only a two hour film, her personality is quite likeable and you really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8074">
        feel for her.<br />
<br />
As the previous reviewer stated, this movie should be (if not already) the benchmark of all anime movies. Animation, sound, story, characters are all great and still enagaging and exciting after more than 20 years since release. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend this to those interested in some Macross nostalgia as well as those who want to see what makes 80&#039;s anime so classically historical and beloved.

    *SINCE CHANCES ARE, YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, I IMPLORE YOU TO SEEK IT OUT BEFORE RETURNING TO THIS REVIEW. THERE ARE PLENTY OF SPOILERS FOR &quot;MACROSS: DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE?&quot;.<br />
<br />
You know, people tend to have a lot of adamant notions on things. There are people who believe that the original version of a story is inherently and exponentially better than alternative versions and retellings. There are people who try to say that men are inherently better than women or vice versa. You have people who claim music to be less impactful and worth being labeled &quot;art&quot; as paintings and fiction. In one fell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242113">
        swoop, Macross: Do You Remember Love manages to address every single one of these issues (including the first and third ones indirectly) and do so phenomenally. As a fan of this franchise since the days of watching Robotech on DVD as a kid, I&#039;m glad to finally examine this work of art.<br />
<br />
We begin in the midst of the war between the Earth forces and the Zentradi. Ultimately, it&#039;s the Earth people who are at a gigantic disadvantage, more so than in the original series. After one such battle which ended up with a few Zentradi crashing into Macross and discovering the &quot;miclones&quot; (or Micronians for Robotech fans), famous superstar pop idol Lynn Minmei is trapped in an engine room with the pilot who rescued her from an armed Zentradi, Hikaru Ichijou. It is then where they bond and form an eventual romance in the span of 3 days, with part of the love expanding on their time together. After another fun time with them goes wrong as not only are they caught by Misa (Hikaru&#039;s commanding officer) and Kaifun (Minmei&#039;s cousin who is seemingly unrelated in the movie for some reason), but all 4 of them, as well as another pilot, Roy Focker, are captured by the Zentradi and are forced to show them their culture before we learn that the Zentradi have been at war with Melteadi. Basically, Zentradi are giant war guys and Melteadi are giant war girls. After an attack on the Zentradi ship, not only does Roy Focker die, but Hikaru and Misa (who got separated from Minmei and Kaifun) are now stranded on a desolate wasteland that was once called Earth.<br />
<br />
With no hope for survival on this now ruined planet, Hikaru and Misa bond after some talk about what the hell they&#039;re gonna do. While one can argue that this romantic development moves a bit too fast, we do see the gist of what they&#039;re going through, in the span of a week, these two, who are alone in this desolate globe, are without hope as they toil away, looking for possible survivors and eventually just trying to survive, they can only really bond if they want to make any of this time remotely worthwhile, and that&#039;s exactly what they do, even after they find a lost city and end up learning that the human race was a combined effort from micronized Zentradi and Melteadi to create an environment and people of both sexes that can live in harmony. With this in mind, the two bond more so than ever, despite their rough introduction to each other as a nagging superior and upstart subordinate. Once the Macross arrived for the details, the Melteadi attack them, and after a few minutes into the fight, the Zentradi show up, using Minmei&#039;s singing as a way to screw them up and force them to retreat, as they have noted that culture is an effective weapon against both the Zentradi and Meltradi, and have learned how to use that to their advantage in their ear against the Meltradi. <br />
<br />
Now all of our protagonists meet back up on Earth, and remember two singular cards, one of which Misa found on Earth. It is here that the love triangle really heats up, as Hikaru has chosen Misa over Minmei and now Minmei will know, and she takes it about as well as a love rival would considering that these two were originally in a relationship, and all of this bites Hikaru in the ass. Now that the lyrics from the cards are now ready for the new song and now that the Meltradi and some of the Zentradi are here, Hikaru rushes desperately to reach Minmei, even if it means literally slapping some sense into her to make her realize that now it&#039;s about the word instead of her dwindling relationship. Afterwards, we get my favorite scene in the movie.<br />
<br />
As the final battle rages on, Minmei sings the titular sing: Do You Remember Love. Not only was this enough to screw up the Melteadi long enough for the Zentradi to take out their leader, but it even convinces some of the Zentradi to turn against their leader, allowing Hikaru to take him out. Was this turn a bit forced, yeah, but it still led to a really satisfying payoff. Following that, Minnie and Misa have a small, quiet, and impactful moment of understanding one another, and it&#039;s done gloriously. With that, both the movie and the war are over. Do I think that some parts could&#039;ve been handled better, yeah, but what we got was still great. It expands only some of the concepts laid out by the original series (Melteadi and Zentradi feuding, the connection between Zentradi/Melteadi and humans), and it does so greatly, as well as tackling some interesting ideas. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad that this movie never tries to pick a side when addressing sexism as a major topic, since that would really be a disastrous move (even if some people will ignorantly call this movie sexist, but I digress). In fact, one could say that there was no true villain in the movie aside from sexism and the ignorance of culture. People were repeatedly put down for being sexist, and both of the alien overlords were eradicated on account of their sexism and ignorance of culture not making them understand cooperation and continue the war against each other. It&#039;s a nice message to send; both sexes should work together instead of bickering over something as dumb and trivial as &quot;which gender is superior&quot;. Not to mention that I really like the message at the end that&#039;s implied by Misa: even an ordinary song can be impactful, for music is exactly that: impactful. We never really get to hear a message that highlights the importance of music and by extension, culture, but it&#039;s always nice to see it handled well without it being spelled out. <br />
<br />
My ultimate gripe is that almost all characters not a part of the main trio get the shaft. Sure,I&#039;m glad Kaifun takes a back seat and doesn&#039;t get to be a total dick, and I&#039;m glad that Roy got to die with badassery, but Max and Millia were sidelined, Roy is really flanderised from his show counterpart (now being an obnoxious and playfully sexist macho man instead of a more suave and down to earth cool guy who also happens to be a lil&#039; bit of a womanizer), Hayao is just a light version of this version of Roy (was he even named in this movie?) and Claudia doesn&#039;t get to be as much of a fun, jovial, and down to earth character as before, but that one was inevitable due to the fact that this is a 2 hour film and the TV series was a series of 36 22 minute episodes. Not to mention that the trio of Zentradi that went to Earth in the original doesn&#039;t show up at all here. At the very least, the trio that occasionally hangs out with Misa and Claudia act as naturally as possible, which is a rarity in anime; side-characters that act genuinely human.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, the main trio gets expanded upon. Hikaru, while more of an asshole in the beginning Han he ever was in the original, he grows rather quickly when he&#039;s stranded on a desolate wasteland of a planet. He&#039;s still pretty great and his ultimate love interest, Misa is handled just as well in the TV series, only with more streamline development. We get to see the more fragile side of her that was not as present as before and it&#039;s rather nice to see the two warm up to each other. Yet out of all of the trio of the love triangle, Minmei was handled the best, by far. People claim this version of her to be infinitely superior to the TV Minmei, and I kinda have to agree with them. Her development was more streamlined, and her demeanor seemed more lax and lovely than the original one was, even making fun little jokes and jabs here and there. Plus, her adventures with Hikaru are a sight to behold. Not to mention that she&#039;s just as beautiful as the scenes with her and Hikaru having fun. Even when she&#039;s at her worst (with the whole love triangle thing) she ends up realizing a grander purpose and that the needs of the world outweigh the needs of her and her romance. This development is so grand in its intensity that it even amazes Hikaru, who made her develop in the first place. As mentioned previously, the moment that sealed the deal on Minmei being my favorite character in this movie was the final scene with her and Misa, which was handled so damn well that I was blown away. Speaking of blown away...<br />
<br />
Studio Artland has been heralded as one of the best studios ever made, mainly due to them working on the critically acclaimed Mushishi and that elitists&#039; fapping shrine, Legend of The Galactic Heroes, which is considered by many to be the creme de la creme of anime. Not to mention that they worked on the original Macross. So, of course, they worked on this and did a splendid job. Although, they weren&#039;t the only studio that worked on it, Tatsunoko Production joined the fun as well. Honestly, both studios did an amazing job with this anime. Every ship, explosion, character, and background is lavishly detailed and it all looks majestic. The action really sells itself as the best in the franchise as well, and the character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto are as gorgeous as ever, and nothing really dips at all. It&#039;s easily one of the best looking anime movies I&#039;ve seen to date, and given that this was in 1984, that&#039;s amazing in its own right. Each location is so strikingly different and full of personality, even the more mystical yet oppressive desolate Earth and the more alien Zentradi and Zentradi environments, which are more distinctly alien than ever before. Then again, when one of your key animators is the legendary Hideaki Anno, you know your eyes are in for a treat. I mean, just look at this movie! I can&#039;t begin to do it justice!<br />
<br />
The OST by Kentarou Haneda is still pretty great, with some classic tracks form the series, and it all works as well as you&#039;d expect from Macross. Now for the real thing which happens to be one of the 3 things that characterize Macross: the songs. Each song sung by Minmei (Mari Ijima, who voices her and sings the songs). All of your favorites from the original series show up here and are as catchy and fun as ever. Plus, the titular song, &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; is easily my favorite of them all, partially due to it playing in the most majestic moment of the movie, and partly since it&#039;s in between the two scenes that made her my favorite character in the movie. It&#039;s a truly delightful song if I do say so myself. As for the dub &quot;Invasion of the Spacenoids&quot;, that is its own abomination that I refuse to associate with this movie. It&#039;s some fucked up localization that is nothing like the movie and is even marketed as its own thing, not with Macross or even Robotech, by even the Robotech cast would&#039;ve been an infinitely better fit. Get that weak shit outta here.<br />
<br />
DYRL is a truly beautiful work, both visually and emotionally. I honestly can&#039;t say much more than what I have aside from mentioning the Max and Milia plotline, which despite a brilliant reversal from their plotline in the TV series, was as sidelined as the characters involved. It&#039;s not my favorite installment in the franchise, but it&#039;s one that can stand perfectly on its own as both a gateway into the franchise and a superb supplement to the original series it diverges from.

    Shoji Kawamori and I have this little understanding: I don&#039;t watch his stuff and he&#039;s allowed to do whatever he wants whilst I occasionally look at the premise for whatever new thing he has coming out whilst going &quot;Kawamori, please&quot;. Throughout the entire history of the man who brought us Escaflowne, there have only been two things he&#039;s made that have interested me to any degree. One was Aquarion EVOL - which admittedly I&#039;ve lost interest in ever rewatching due to the fact that it depends too much on a style that ages faster than bananas dipped in acid - and the other is his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168329">
        movie summary of Macross SDF, which I haven&#039;t actually watched, but my colleagues who have seen it assured to me that Lynn Kaifun is a grade-A dickwad.<br />
<br />
Well he doesn&#039;t get a chance to be a dickwad here, because he barely shows up in the movie. In fact, if your name isn&#039;t Hikaru, Minmay, or Misa, chances are you&#039;re going to have less screen time than Tron did when Kingdom Hearts caused Disney to realize that maybe there&#039;s still more that could have been done with that forgotten universe. If you&#039;ve seen any Kawamori anime - let alone Macross SDF - prior to watching this film, then you pretty much know what to expect. Three people are put in a love triangle. Said love triangle is used as a basis for mecha action and cheesy pop tunes. Egoism is abound all over the dialogue. Basically, a bunch of silly stuff that makes me embarrassed for Kawamori&#039;s parents.<br />
<br />
The story is set in some universe where humanity is at war with an alien race known as the Zentradi - an all-male race of giant aliens who are at the same time at war with their female counterparts, the Mentradi (yeah I have no idea why the females got the &quot;men&quot; prefix either). Because gender cross-breeding does not exist in their culture, they are extremely surprised when they discovered that the different sexes in humanity can do things like hug, kiss, do the Lincoln, everything that Disney has desensitized us to...to the point that they react like KyoAni fans whenever their precious moe being has her lips tainted. Our main hero/ladies&#039; man of the story is Hikaru Ichiyo, a young soldier who becomes acquainted with a popular idol named Lynn Minmay after an attack traps them in an enclosed space for days. And when a man and a woman are trapped alone with no one else around and no sign of rescue anytime soon, maintaining purity was one of the first things to drop from the human mind.<br />
<br />
This leads to the two having a small relationship until another attack strands Hikaru on a post-apocalyptic Earth with his superior female officer, Misa Hayase for a month. And considering that he&#039;s stranded with a more mature female in a more empty environment for a far longer time, this part of the plot might as well have had large subtitles the entire act that said &quot;Hikaru will move on to another woman and this will cause awkward shit to happen later on when he reunites with the pop idol he&#039;s only had one date with&quot; all over the screen. Although I guess that would make it hard to see the eventual making out the two soldiers performed in the cold wasteland right before the giant robot spots them since love shines so brightly on normal Earth let alone a destroyed one. And speaking of obvious plot points, I don&#039;t need to detail what happens after the loving couple is rescued and brought back to civilization and Minmay, do I? I hope not, because it doesn&#039;t deserve its own paragraph unless you&#039;re one of those outdated writers who thinks that Wikipedia is the standard we should base all online writing on.<br />
<br />
I know what you&#039;re going to say to me at this point. &quot;Wait a minute. Doesn&#039;t Mr. Flaw hate stories about soldiers, idols, love triangles, robots, and everything else we find cool? What exactly makes this thing stand out?&quot; Well first off, I can tolerate most of those elements as long as they&#039;re in service to something else, and since the love triangle along with discovering the secrets behind the Zentradi culture and such are put in the forefront, the only thing the film has to do is get rid of the problems I have with the former whilst putting a good amount of focus. And I liked the love triangle in here for the same reason I liked the one in Kids on the Slope: because people actually act out on their feelings rather quickly instead of just mope for...well okay Minmay moped for a bit after discovering the truth, but there was an alien attack happening around her, so I let that slide.<br />
<br />
Also, forgive me for going into lame fanboy praise here, but my god is this thing beautiful to look at. Whilst I haven&#039;t actually seen the show, I did catch a few glimpses of clips and pics here and there, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the production values on this thing are a serious upgrade by comparison. In fact, Do You Remember Love is probably the best animated thing to come out of Japan I have ever seen next to Redline and Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer. Every frame is bursting with enough life to make Toontown envious and shot in such an epic way to the point that you can classify the film as the equal to James Cameron&#039;s Titanic in regards to the epic feeling they give their love stories. Well okay, I remember one particularly noticeable still frame in the film, but it was following up the final climax and a fight scene involving Bruce Lee would look lame following that up.<br />
<br />
Not going to deny that I have some problems with the buildup. The whole &quot;stranded on Earth&quot; thing wasn&#039;t the most engaging of acts and the actual political stuff makes me about as indifferent as I am to all other fictional political stuff, especially if it&#039;s written by Sunrise. But that final action scene is a work of art in of itself. Now everyone and their mum has already gone off on how it&#039;s one of the best climaxes an anime has ever produced and how the song matched perfectly with the intensity and how the power of love is more butch here than it was in those Care Bears movies, so I won&#039;t go into detail myself, but I will say that if Mass Effect had the balls to do that sort of ending, the outrage wouldn&#039;t have been nearly as volatile. And I probably would have played it for more than three hours.<br />
<br />
All in all, Do You Remember Love is pretty much everything that Macross fans remember about the show. Same themes. Same love triangle. Same aliens who don&#039;t seem to get that we prefer to kiss our females rather than kill them - unless you support a certain video game controversy whose name rhymes with &quot;Fame or Fate&quot;. And it hits me in that romantic gut that mostly died off when Suzuka came into my life because it gets how you&#039;re supposed to do romance. You&#039;re supposed to do it with honesty. With chemistry. With explosions. Lots and lots of explosions.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the KyoAni fanbase being represented as giant aliens helps too.

    Ah, compilation movies. They’re one of those things in Anime that, after a while, you just kinda get used to seeing. The original MSG Movie trilogy is what made them popular, and many have tried to emulate their success. The problem, of course, is that more often than not they’re trying to cram too much into too little time, which just makes them unfocused and messy. It legitimately seems that only Sunrise can get them right.<br />
<br />
There is, however, an exception. Kinda. Macross as a Franchise is weird with its continuity, with the most generally agreed theory being that all TV Series and movies are dramatic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319068">
        retelling of “Real” events, kinda like how fans of Legend Of The Galactic Heroes like to call the difference between versions of that story as different historians doing their research and differing due to using different sources. This whole mess started with, apropiately enough, a movie based on the original SDF Macross: Super Dimensional Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?, which is also widely considered the golden standard most Anime films from the 80’ were compared to. Why? Let’s find out:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I can’t really apply my usual method of adapting compilation movies here as, well, this isn’t a compilation movie at all. DYRL is a full retelling of the OG SDF Macross, all done from the ground up and with the expectation that you already have seen the show as this movie doesn’t bother much with exposition. In turn, this also allowed Kawamori and his team to change the story as they saw fit to make it work in the new medium, turning a story that was basically 3 cours long into one single movie.<br />
<br />
There are of course issues, as you would imagine. Most subplots have either been axed off or greatly reduced. Roy in particular turns from a really well fleshed out character to a really minor one with a few amusing scenes. Same happens to Max, my favorite character, who has his whole arc greatly reduced in importance and screentime. In general, part of the appeal of the original Macross, that it was the journey of this group of people who eventually became the final survivors of humanity is, sadly, now loss.<br />
<br />
However, to make up for it, the film acknowledges that. Instead, all of the focus is shifted to the classic love triangle between Hikaru, Hayase and Minmay. It is these characters that receive all the focus and their subplot is what drives the story forward, and with all honestly? It is done excellently. Not only does it not drag on for as long as the TV Series did, but overall they all have an excellent amount of chemistry together.<br />
<br />
However it is also used as a way to show one of the main themes of the original series: Things change. People change. You can’t just go back to the past and make things how they used to be all of the sudden. While looking back at the past is wondrous, you also need to look forward and accept things for what they are now.  This is all cleverly represented with Minmay’s reaction to realizing Hikaru’s feelings for Hayase and just wishing for things to go back to how they used to be, refusing to accept how both she and Hikaru have changed.<br />
<br />
There are also a lot of smaller changes that don’t really affect the quality of the plot, but are nice. The most obvious one being how the Zentradi were given their own language (And yes, they did go full on Klingon Alphabet with it) and a McGuffin our heroes have to find. It doesn’t really affect the plot in any meaningful way, but it does help soemewhat streamline the whole narrative for a movie format. Overall, it’s hard not to praise the makers of this movie for making a 30+ episodes long story a fully cohesive 2 hours long movie.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Of course, this is a very character driven show, so the cast better be good, and thankfully they are. Our main trio is changed a bit, with them immediately starting off at their midpoint of their character arcs: Hikaru is less whiny, Hayase is less of a hardass and Minmay is already suffering from burnout.  This all done mostly because they changed the way they meet so the original starting point would make no sense, and I think it paid off. Minmay in particular benefits from being less of an airhead and overall less naiive.<br />
<br />
As stated before, however, the side cast does suffer as a result. You do overall get the gist of them, but not much else really. They’re mostly there as accompaniment to the actual main plot. While it is a problem, I don’t think it bothered me much. The movie is clearly made for people who have watched the show, and even then they are still generally likable. Do I wish they’d gotten more focus? Of course! But this isn’t their movie, and I’m okay with that.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
Gone are the off-model days of the TV Series and only the Sakuga remains, and dear lord, this film is absolutely beautiful looking. No, seriously, this puts some movies from the 90’ to shame. Everything, from the characters to the mecha to the absolutely beautiful missile massacres looks absolutely amazing, and it all still holds up. Best of all the Zentradi got an absolutely amazing and much needed redesign. It’s incredible to see what this series could’ve done with a better budget.<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
There isn’t much to say here. Most of them are reused from the show, bar a few minor alterations, generally just a few added details. The only one that deserves any special mention is Hikaru’s customized Valkyrie he uses in the final fight, which is freaking badass and I love it.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
This being Macross you expect a great OST, and you’d be right. Many tracks are reused from the show, but there are also a few new ones and a few rearrangements of old songs as well. Minmay gets a ton of her songs back, and while I’m still not a fan of most of them, they are all very well sung. Of course, you can’t talk about this movie without mentioning the song it is named after: “Ai Oboete Imasuka?”, one of the finest songs to grace this franchise.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting: <br />
<br />
Since the whole cast from the show reprises their roles and does a great job, I won’t really repeat myself as I already covered them in my review for the series. Instead I’ll mention someone who isn’t even in this movie but I don’t really have anywhere else to mention him: Nojima Kenji.  Since Hase Arihiro died in the mid 90’, Nojima was brought in to replace him as Hikaru has appeared in a ton of videogames since, with Nojima himself making his debut in the role in the original Super Robot Wars Alpha. He does a great job too; while some of the honesty of Hase’s performance is lost, Nojima does a great impression of him, particularly impressive in the aforementioned game as he either had to completely re-record all of Hase’s old lines or do new lines alongside Hase’s old lines from this movie, and the transition is seamless. So yeah, props to Banpresto’s casting department.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I believe I have made my thoughts on this movie clear already, but to put it bluntly, this film is great. They took the longest subplot of the original series and made some changes to it to make it better and made a movie out of it, and it all turned out wonderfully. It is a fantastic movie and a must-watch for all Anime fans. Yet the irony in all of this? For all the praise it gets, it is but a simple love story people back in the day enjoyed watching.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    Intense, powerful, eloquent, moving.<br />
<br />
These words came to me when I saw this alternative version of the Macross series. (It&#039;s not compulsory to watch the tv series to understand and enjoy this movie) <br />
<br />
First of all, I&#039;d like to say that, visually, I took a slap. I saw Akira, Redline, Gurren Lagann and many other quality shows but I never ever saw something so divinely well moving than in &quot;Macross, do you remember love?&quot;.<br />
<br />
The fights are at same time violent, powerful and choregraphed with a sort of delicacy, nobility in the movement. Theses movements are incredibly harmonious and at the same time, on numerous occasions, direct

          <span style="display: none;" id="review107205">
        and true. The sweetness and the violence alternate in a brilliant way. The decorations are extremely worked, colors are magnificient and even monsters are well designed. (I advise you to watch the HD version)<br />
<br />
But this movie is not only beautiful ; what makes it a true masterpiece are the tackled themes, that can be explicit or implicit. It&#039;s a &quot;form&quot; in the service of the &quot;content&quot; and mutually, that is to say : the ideal situation. Moreover, even if the duration of two hours obliges to get to the point, all is said, all is clear, all is explained. That speaks about extraterrestrial, about genetic things, that looks complicated... but not ! Everything is totally clarified, it is probably the most clearly science-fiction anime I&#039;ve ever seen. The made choices are relevant, the characters are very credible. Of course, they are note incredibly charismatic, but worked with accuracy, what makes them charming and relevant in the story they have to tell.<br />
<br />
The message of the movie, that I let you discover, is of an absolute foolishness, but that&#039;s also the japanime&#039;s magic ! Everything is radiant, filled with magnificience, we have a gorgeous fight with a romantic music in background. To mix so skillfully the genres was a brilliant idea. There is some dispair, fury, enjoyment, beauty and the most important :<br />
<br />
Romantism !

    Well, this movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily begin where the series does, or an established beginning like where the SDF-1 is about to make its maiden voyage and then transports to the other side of the milky way and must make their way home. Instead, the movie is more about how its already established that those events did happen, but we don&amp;rsquo;t see them. In addition, Hikaru is already a Valkyrie pilot and Minmei is already a star, though they have yet to develop some sort of relationship. By accident, like in the TV series, though under some slightly different circumstances and results, their bonding encounter is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8602">
        when they get caught inside the engines of the macros and upon their freedom, they become the target of the tabloids. It&amp;rsquo;s just that in the TV series, Minemei was yet to be a star, while in this movie, she already is and people are gossiping over what they may have been up to while stuck.<br />
<br />
Other changes is that the female Zentradi, renamed the Meltlandi, are recognized as a different faction in the war. Despite all of that, the movie still retains the themes of love triangles and such in the same fashion, but Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s coming of age story is not that well emphasized in my personal opinion. However, because the series of Macross was told in this single movie, other elements such as Max&amp;rsquo;s and Milia&amp;rsquo;s relationship is slightly nodded to, but not at all officially established or developed. But in general, the main characters from the series are still present and still share the same fates but under different circumstances and situations. Despite this being a movie off a series, I say you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to have any familiarity with the series to watch this movie because the characters are already established and developed. It&amp;rsquo;s not really who, but it&amp;rsquo;s question of how you want to know the characters and this movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t address it in the same way the TV series does. Despite that, the characterization is still faithful. But it offers another kind of ending and its own distinctive approach on the origins of the Zentradis where you are getting a movie still semi-original in its own right.<br />
<br />
Not only are you getting new footage in this movie, but there is much more updated designs and animation quality over all you can say is appropriately theatrical. Despite this movie being as old as I am, I find the animation to be amazing. I like how it&amp;rsquo;s really high res while the series was more grainy with the quality. It&amp;rsquo;s brighter with the res, but still knows how to keep dark tones. Especially with the Zentradi characters who have a much more updated look. They look more alien and monster like and not as humanoid or human resembling in the TV series. They are colored much darker and are just re-designed altogether. Minmei&amp;rsquo;s concerts are also just great to watch and have excellent elaboration.<br />
<br />
The mech designs are still the same, but the execution of the action is always as exciting as ever and spread out. The city inside the SDF-1 is excellently detailed and I love the battle scene there.<br />
<br />
Much of the music from the TV series is still present in the series. For example, the moment you see the title screen, you hear an instrumental version to the opening theme from the TV series. I thought the music was good enough in its own rights and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it needed that much changing, but could certainly use some additions which is where the main theme, Do You Remember Love comes in. This was the song that really made Mari Iijima an established singer. She still sings today and works out of LA. Her talent is just incredible and well rounded. She can sing bubble gum pop in the likes of Shao Bai Lo which is also sung in the series, and this really incredible love song right here. It&amp;rsquo;s really hypnotic and the lyrics are just beautiful.<br />
<br />
And the Japanese voice cast still retains more or less the same voice actors from the TV series which is good and I got nothing more to comment on except I really liked how they gave the Zentradi their own language which is subtitled to Japanese which is then subtitled to English depending on what version you watch. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that approach is more realistic, but more logical and practical. I also like how they were given an echo sound effect and well modulated in that kind of way.<br />
<br />
Considering how much of a success the TV series was and how it continues to be a success today, I think the movies could have been a TV series like Gundam like how I said earlier. Granted Gundam movies in comparison tended to stick to the design and animation style of the TV series while Macross steps above that. I think in Macross certain characters were not centered around that much, like Max, who is my favorite character. I like how he has this nice guy personality and looks all nerdy, and yet, his piloting skills is shown to be much more superior to Hikaru&amp;rsquo;s and I think he takes down Roy. But I gotta give the experience edge to Roy and in a lot of situations, that out does skill and natural talent. Though it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily the same as the series and is just meant to be a retelling, it&amp;rsquo;s still distinctive in terms of art and animation style, and music. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for top notch plot, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call this movie that, but still has something engaging, but the characters are too established already and all you need is the relationship development which I don&amp;rsquo;t think should be that centralized. But anyway, you&amp;rsquo;ll also get action and adventure

    Most people in the anime community have probably heard of the show Mobile Suit Gundam. It’s unquestionably one of the grandfathers of the anime that air today. It proved anime can have narrative that can be taken seriously by an adult audience and the tropes that it perfected for its time are still used in anime today, even if the mecha genre is dying they can be seen in other genres and if you watched the original Mobile Suit Gundam it won’t be hard to trace back the tropes. It is arguably the most influential anime of all time and deserves to be placed on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254040">
        a pedestal for its historical value. But many people miss out on a mecha title that is disputably; equally as important as Gundam. That anime is Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Macross captured the hearts of many anime fans that were already indulged in the medium and brought in a new wave of admirers from overseas. It is also the progenitor of all the idol anime that have flooded the market in the last 6-7 years. For many it has cemented its place as one of the anime classics from the 80’s.<br />
<br />
Macross: Do you remember love is an alternate re-telling of the original Macross TV show that began airing in 1982. Both instalments of the franchise were brought to life by Studio Artland, the same studio who have produced acclaimed shows such as Mushishi and the king itself; Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  The movie features the exact same themes, characters and style found in the original, but it condenses all of Macross’ elements into two hours of runtime. You would think that trying to condense components of a TV show wouldn’t work in a two hour movie, and that it would come off as “rushed” or “crammed”. Let me assure you that DYRL(will call it this from now on) manages to take everything that was good about the original and produce something that is if not better; on par with the original.<br />
<br />
The same cast from the original Macross returns but due to the re-telling of the plot, their roles are somewhat played out a little differently, but the core elements of what made those characters who they are remain the same. What really stands out about the cast most is how well their chemistry just clicks. The biggest hand in making this work is their personalities which all bounce off each other so well to create plenty of entertaining interactions throughout the movie. They are what give character friendships a real sense of comradery that is missing in many casts today and the romantic relationships just clicked in the blink of an eye from the get go. Snarky remarks, flirtatious dialogue, amusing jokes, Macross’ cast had it all. With great personalities and cast chemistry, DYRL doesn’t want you to like its characters; it wants you to love them.<br />
<br />
Likewise, one of the most prominent plot points in DYRL was a love triangle between Ichijou, Misa and Minmay. For the most part, the romance was executed fine. Instead of painting a realistic picture on the romantic relationships, Macross opted to go for a more idealistic portrayal of romance that many young teenage girls and boys would dream of being involved in when thinking about relationships that comes with their age. On top of not only accomplishing the task well, the idealistic romance would appeal to a huge demographic as both teenagers but adults can also relate to the cast as they also know how it feels to be in the shoes of a teenager. Hikaru and Minmay’s chemistry felt so natural and so rapid that it almost felt like a completely believable tale. It’s this charm and connectivity between the characters that is the focal point of the story and what marks Macross: DYRL as such an immersive and magical experience. On the other hand, Misa’s romantic relationship with Hikaru was a little less plausible. While I feel it was ultimately a success, Hikaru’s chemistry with Misa was not as convincing as Minmay. While starting off on a negative note because of Hikaru’s immaturity they were given a sufficient amount of time to bond later on in the film. The love triangle was certainly more of a success rather than a failure, but what was evident in the latter half of the film was some netorare that didn’t serve any purpose to the narrative and felt like a cheap hoax to manipulate the emotions of the audience. Given the drastic situation at the given moment it could have worked far better if it served the overall narrative in a meaningful way, but thankfully the netorare didn’t last long enough to detract from the story.<br />
<br />
Another drawback is the lack of characterization given to the secondary cast. They were all on the periphery offering some occasional banter and nothing more. I wasn’t personally too bothered as seeing the original Macross had already connected me with all the cast. But the side characters&#039; lack of screen time and characterization is undeniably valid criticism that would be nearly impossible to refute. <br />
<br />
The very first sequence is perfect for capturing everything that makes macross the anime it is. The audience is immediately thrown into one of the Minmays concerts and is immediately interrupted by an attack. The heat pumping OST, the slick dogfights, the humorous banter, Minmays infectious music. It captures the “feel” of Macross perfectly and does a magnificent job of increasing the excitement for the rest of the movie.<br />
<br />
From then on, the rest of the film is briskly paced with a very fine balance between being a dramatic war story and a charming love story. Both elements are integrated comfortably without detracting from each other and the music also plays an integral part in the plot without being a one-dimensional gimmick merely just for fan service, as one of the core themes in DYRL is the power of music, and how it bring people together regardless of ideology, culture or race. On paper, DYRL’s story is ludicrous. Not in the random sense but its premise is one that would probably not be found in any other show apart from other macross instalments. Leaving the fate of the galaxy to a single j-pop song is about as ambitious as an anime can get. But as ridiculous and stupid as it sounds; Macross makes it all tick by giving solid context on the origins of all the races as well as the culture currently up taken by the human race known as ‘protoculture’ in the story. The story isn’t the most intricately written nor does it tackle a multitude of complex themes. But using enhancing tools to an anime like music as a means to serve its overall story is quite unique especially for its time. Some have criticized the film for its overly idealistic narrative and characters, which are far too blinded by love. They are both understandable points as to why someone wouldn’t like the nature of the anime. However its earnestness, charm and its charismatic cast are all what make its narrative compelling and the tone it establishes with all these elements works seamlessly with its idealistic narrative and ultimately what won me over.<br />
<br />
The most impressive element of Macross:DYRL is by far the OST and the animation. Both were already strong in the 1982 TV series, to the film takes it to a whole new level. And that is also taking into consideration that it’s made in 1984. All of the dogfights are energetic and the Jazz fusion soundtrack only enhances the experience; making them more adrenaline pumping. The art style is the classic 80’s anime art style that is found in most shows around that time period that serves well to bring out the spunky charm the characters all possess. The character designs were nicely drawn and anything mechanical was drawn with top notch attention to detail. There were a few small derps when the characters moved but punishing the film because of that would be a serious case of nit-picking. Its animation still holds up today as some of the best I have seen. As good as the Jazz soundtrack is being played over the dogfights; the most noticeable tracks in the OST are Minmays songs. All of them are great standalone listeners but the best of them all has to be by far is ‘do you remember love’. It complements the tone and romantic energy already established in the film perfectly.<br />
<br />
And all the elements in the film come together in a spectacular display of animation skill and visual flair to create one of the most memorable finales I have personally had the pleasure of watching. It was the climax of everything the film stood for and set out to achieve. To the core theme portrayed, the energetic dogfights, the charming music; everything intertwines and is executed so well that I cannot do anything but congratulate the staff on a job well done.  <br />
<br />
<br />
In the 80’s Macross was one of the most popular anime around. Macross:DYRL was the most rented VHS at the time. The US remake(robotech) brought in a new wave of fans into the medium. More instalments in the franchise are still being made today and it is largely responsible for the influx of idol anime today. Macross’ value runs deeper than just achieving critical and financial success. It has historical value that has kept it relevant throughout time. It cannot be argued that it comes with its drawbacks. The romance and characterization isn’t quite as tightly written and believable as the original, but everything else in the story was well done. I highly recommend DYRL to just about any anime fan, as I found it to be one of the most enjoyable anime/movies I have had the pleasure of watching. Even anime fans who are not quite fond of retro anime and mecha should give this one a shot. It offers something for everyone to enjoy and its narrative is targeted more towards a mainstream audience compared to some other mecha and space anime that are strictly for hardcore fans of the genre. It possesses a compelling narrative, enigmatic characters, A-tier audio-visuals full of impressive visual flair and an unforgettable finale. And while it might not be the most polished piece of work in the medium it is certainly one of the most charming and memorable ones. DYRL doesn’t simply ask you to like it; it asks you to love it. It wants to trap you in its magical charm, and for me it has most certainly succeeded.<br />

    30 year later, this is still one of the most stunning works of animation I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Macross : DYRL is more of a reinterpretation of the series (roughly episodes 2 thru 27) rather then a summary.  While the primary plot elements remain the same, I still would recommend watching the series first in order to be able to fully appreciate this movie.  <br />
<br />
The action sequences are wonderfully choreographed and set a new standard in the industry for their detail and fluidity.  The animation is amazing and can hold its own against anything released recently.<br />
<br />
Almost every single character is improved.  Of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100617">
        course the development isn&#039;t there that the series had, but they all seem a bit more mature and are lacking most of the annoying traits that they had in the series.  Particularly the main female leads of Misa and Minmay.  I have a slight issue with a lack of Max and Milia, but it&#039;s made up for somewhat with one very intense dogfight between them.<br />
<br />
We also get a treat with a new dynamic on how the male (Zentran) and female (Meltlan) Zentradi interact.   They took the resentment and segregation between them present in the series and expanded on it.<br />
<br />
The music is an improvement over the series as well.  There are several new tracks included with new recordings of most of the music from the original.  As per usual Mari Iijima&#039;s voice does not disappoint.<br />
<br />
10/10 <br />

    Well, really an anime masterpiece from 1984, i,ve only seen in twice ever i bought it on tape in 1995 or 96 wich was an original production tape produced in 84. But the movie itself and the animation......GREAT! and then a saga started ever since, and it just MORE than space battles, its quite emotional too some moments. The art just belongs to that time, loads of ideas they´ve put in and background fillers as for the charachters, If u gonna see this the 1st time ever, most of them have an important role u probably gonna pick out some favs!

    STORY 6/10<br />
<br />
Without delving into the details too much, this first Macross movie, like the other Macross shows, is about culture, song, and love&#039;s ability to touch people and to cease violent conflict. Both the Zentradi aliens and humans are greatly moved by Minmay&#039;s music, even though the Zentradi thought themselves to be pure warriors, incapable of any social behavior except organized warfare.<br />
<br />
Extending this concept to our society, the movie makes a firm statement about the universality of the power of music and love, and by extension, the humanity that we all share.No matter what gender, race, origin, etc., we can are sensitive to love and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23410">
        love songs.<br />
<br />
Despite this beautiful overarching (albeit simplistic) theme, the plot is not too well executed. There was very little that could not be predicted and very little to excite. Perhaps it was because I had watched the 2008 Macross Frontier series, which had a similar basic plot. The movie lacked interesting subplots and the dialogue and pacing were rather banal.<br />
<br />
ART 10/10:<br />
<br />
For a 1984 movie, the animation is outstanding. Everything is highly realistic and well-executed. I have no doubt this set a standard for many years in the industry.<br />
<br />
Of course, compared to modern animation, there is little to be excited about here, but even so, it remains a good watch for the casual viewer, and a gem for those who enjoy the oldies.<br />
<br />
SOUND 7/10:<br />
<br />
The sound was good, especially for its time. I suppose that I wasn&#039;t particular taken in by Minmay&#039;s (the singer&#039;s) voice, though many people did/do like her very much. At the same time though, I am not a fan of pop love songs, which the series focuses on. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER 3/10:<br />
<br />
The character development is nonexistent in this movie. The minor characters have no development, and even for the main characters, it is very scarce. A few details about their past (e.g. for Hikaru, about his parents and why he joined the military) and some trite and poor developed telling of the present (e.g. the main love triangle).<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking to watch engrossing and inspirational characters, this is the wrong movie.<br />
<br />
OVERALL  7/10:<br />
<br />
Overall, I think it&#039;s a good movie. For an 80s movie, the animation is amazing. So I enjoyed it from a historical perspective, but also from a watching-for-fun perspective. The biggest downside was the poor plot and character development, which left me wanting much more. I suppose only so much can be done within the time frame, but even so, I was left disappointed.

More campy and more condensed than its source material, Do You Remember Love? is also much more beautiful than its source material. <br />
<br />
This film version of the original Macross is much less subtle, and much more extravagant. It has a totally retooled story, has a LEGENDARY animation team, who would go forth and work on some of the best anime ever made. It was the benchmark for animation for a long while, and its very apparent why; the entire runtime of this film really is pure, unadulterated sasuga, bolstered by a beautifully-composed score. <br />

But in the end, aside from its technical perfection and influence, Do

    Macross is a classic mecha series that&#039;s surprisingly suits well with the musical dramas settings on it.<br />
<br />
PLOT:<br />
In the fictional modern world of 2009, Humans were engaged in war with a giant male aliens in which was called Zentraedi and their female counterpart Meltrandi. These two types of aliens were also warring each other. At one time when a singer called Lynn Minmay doing her concert, the Zentraedi began their invasion to humans, and she almost die during the incident but being saved by a young mecha pilot called Hikaru Ichijo, in which he unintentionally saw her struggling when he retreated to the Macross, humans mothership.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212013">
        They soon get trapped somewhere at the mothership and was founded later. After then, Hikaru begins his romantic journey as well as his war to defeat the giant aliens. The premise was pretty good, combining musical romance with mechs fighting. The pacing, considering this is a movie reboot of a 36 episodes series which will probably be rushed, is acceptable. And the ending was also pretty well done, although not as good as my expectations. So overall, it was pretty good one.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
This movie have so many characters introduced considering the duration so well, most of them aren&#039;t well developed, only the protagonist seems to be quite three dimensional (or maybe between two and three dimensional.) The characters are somewhat relatable for me. I&#039;d say overall the characterization was slightly better than average.<br />
<br />
SOUNDS AND VISUALS:<br />
This is probably the best part of this movie. The art was very fluid, the action was drawn good, and it surprisingly also has a great atmosphere, but keep in mind that I also consider the year of it&#039;s release too, it&#039;s brilliant for a 80-s film. As for the sound, what can you expect more for musical film? Lynn song was beautiful IMO, and the sound effects during the actions are also very good.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
This is probably the worst part of my review. Not that I didn&#039;t enjoy old shows, but rather like I&#039;m not very interested in mechas, NTR scenes, and high dose of sexism, even more than nowadays ecchis or harems (I didn&#039;t really like the idea of overly sexist or feminist story tbh since I&#039;m an egalitarian.) But other than all that thing that turning me off I pretty enjoy the other aspects. The fact that I haven&#039;t watched the 36 episodes of the series may be also take account to some of my discontent to this show, so I&#039;m going to say sorry for you guys Macross fans. If you&#039;re a mecha fan and okay with old shows and sexism, I pretty recommend this show to be watched tbh.<br />
<br />
Okay guys I think that&#039;s all of my review, thank you for spending your time reading this, I hope you enjoyed this!

    When it comes to adapting anime series to the big screen, the same problems are always evident and almost always make the movie inferior to the original series. While Macross: Do You Remember Love? is no different when it comes down to cutting out integral scenes that made the story so strong, it compromises this loss by remaking the anime entirely and ensuring fans and new viewers alike that this isn&#039;t simply a dumbed down version of a great anime intended to churn out an extra buck, but rather a new experience that does justice to the things we loved about the original in its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199559">
        own ways.<br />
<br />
The most obvious difference between DYRL and the original series is the way it looks. Despite coming out a mere year after the original - not even hitting the middle of the 80s (!) - it looks as if it came out a decade later. The art style in DYRL is still absolutely stunning to look at not only in its increased amount of detail, but how it reimagines the settings and character designs entirely and always improves upon the original art design. After watching this, you&#039;ll probably feel that this is the way the original series should&#039;ve always looked, budget aside. We still commonly run into framerate issues, but for the 80s this is still phenomenal quality.<br />
<br />
With the original Macross being one of my all-time favorite anime, I couldn&#039;t help but be disappointed by the amount of scenes that were cut. This was escalated by the feeling that many scenes were dragged out longer than they should have been and could have allowed more time to include things from the original. Despite this, the most major aspects of the storyline are still told, and even done so in different ways that will surprise an old fan while staying on the right track to the original outcome.<br />
<br />
Possibly the biggest change to the story is that of the personalities of Hikaru and Minmay. They both act significantly older than their series counterparts, being more mature and confident in their feelings. This likely had to be done to speed up the pacing of their relationship, but nonetheless it makes the story lose its coming-of-age elements and feels like a more standard adult romance/drama. This is a loss, but again, at least it&#039;s something new. Fokker, Max, Milia, Kakizaki, and the rest of the supporting cast move over to give Hikaru, Minmay, and Misa the screentime they need, but are thankfully not removed entirely like many anime series adaptations do.<br />
<br />
Though inferior to the series as usual (and absolutely should be watched second), Do You Remember Love? is still an excellent example of how good an anime series adaptation can be done in just one movie. This is because it was specifically written for the screen rather than cutting up a script that was meant for episodic syndication. It seems obvious, and it probably is, but few studios would pay the big bucks to make brand new animation, art, and a screenplay. Bravo to that. I was also hoping for an &quot;alternate&quot; ending (fans know what I mean) to the series, but alas it&#039;s not meant to be.

    ***There will be spoilers in this review.***<br />
<br />
For an upcoming project it was necessary for me to see this film. I had not seen anything Macross related before seeing this film but the promotional artwork for the film got me really excited. However after sitting through the two hour runtime, I am frustrated. <br />
<br />
The beginning of this film was somewhere between great and amazing. The opening thirty or so minutes really pulled me. The opening concert, the fight outside the space ship, the rescue of the singer, the short bonding between the main characters, all of these moments were done exquisitely. <br />
<br />
Another element of the film

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263188">
        that is on full display from the get-go is the gorgeous art. The character models, the architecture of the buildings, and the subtle flourishes around the main animation are honestly stunning. Even with the grainy look of the keyframes and the parts where things jump slightly (due to the drawings not completely staying in the same spot between frames) this film is absolutely a testament to amazing animation and art for its time and it looks timeless. <br />
<br />
The “robots” however I was not ready for. The combination of robots and planes are, in my opinion, laughable. I ended up talking to multiple people after watching this film to get some other views on the series. Apparently a lot of the other series that took place around this time borrowed from each other heavily and that the whole “robot that is also an airplane” is supposed to be an accepted thing. It unfortunately seemed pretty silly to me and honestly made me laugh quite a bit throughout the film. It&#039;s a shame too because there are a lot of really great action shots in the film.<br />
<br />
Along with the funny looking robots, there is a serious issue with the scaling of things. Are the green bad guys giants? They peer down on the main cast (when they are captured) like they are ants. Are the green henchmen also giants? They look normal size later on in the film when there are peace negotiations. Are the bad guy lady people giants? I was so fucking confused.<br />
<br />
Lets get back to the plot; just before the half way point the main cast are abducted by the green bad guys. It&#039;s at this point where we learn something really fucking stupid; the green bad guy giants are afraid of affection. Hugs, kisses, all of that is their weakness. For what seemed like a serious feeling universe suddenly got really childish. It&#039;s this concept that really started to ruin the film for me. Anyways more stuff happens and two of them escape (the main male character and his boss lady) by, yes you guessed it, kissing each other to make their pursuers wither in fear. Oh also around this time it is shown that there are also bad guy girls. They kind of show up conveniently while the main characters are being observed. With all of this commotion the male MC and his boss are able to escape however the female lead from the beginning of the film and her brother remain captured. <br />
<br />
So the two escapees are transported to Earth because space science. We are then supposed to believe that 20 minutes of footage is supposed to encompass an entire month on Earth. Not only that but the male MC just says fuck it and moves onto his boss lady. We see a beautifully shot and framed kiss scene that means nothing to me. They are then rescued by Macross (at this point I found out that it is the name of the Main human ship). Almost immediately we are thrown back into a fight but this time with the giant lady bad guys. Shit happens then the fight is over. Now the green bad guys who may or may not be giants want peace with the humans. This conveniently allows the main female singer lead to be reunited with her love except, as you already know, he has moved onto boss lady. So now we have a love triangle. Fuck this film.<br />
<br />
At this point I seriously thought to myself “fuck this film”. It had captivated me with such a mysterious and loving intro. It had me interested in the main characters by not telling me why to like them but by showing me. Now almost an hour and a half later I hate them. Any feelings I had towards them is gone. “Oh here is a love triangle. Oh wait music is the weapon to use against the bad guys! Wait some of the bad guys want to join up with the humans.” WTF IS GOING ON.<br />
<br />
“Wtf is going on” is how I felt about the ending. Never have I been so flustered with the ending to a film. The pacing of the beginning of the film is simple and day to day. Then we skip a month, introduce horrid plot devices, then have a grandiose (and beautiful looking) final fight. Then the film ends. Where in the hell is the brother of the main female lead? Where in the fuck did the bad guy girls go?<br />
<br />
I...I&#039;m so frustrated. The art, animation, music, and beginning part of this film are all astounding. Truly a work of art. However the asinine remaining parts/elements of the film has a direct invitation to be forgotten by my brain. Please see yourself out love triangle, mechonised airplanes with arms/legs, and singing weapon of mass destruction. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4.3/10<br />

Overall: 3.7/10<br />

    I can&#039;t help but compare Macross and Gundam, and therefore see this movie as an attempt to make some more cash off of the TV series without animating an entire new season. However, I admire the fact that they actually animated a new product instead of reusing footage from the series, which makes &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; feel like much more of a real movie than any of the Gundam trilogy entries. Despite this, the story suffers significantly from being crunched into 2 hours, and loses much of the charm that it had before.<br />
<br />
The visuals are really the highlight of the movie. Thick lashes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293798">
        and shimmering eyes are abundant, and the Zentradi are back with an exceedingly squishy and organic look, which is pretty damn creepy. We get a much better variety of enemy mechs, as opposed to the cavalcade of leg pods in the series. The direction is generally pretty great. A lot of motion shots utilize fantastic perspectives, and the battle scenes are overwhelming with missile spam (a plus in my book). Dialogue scenes feel the least inspired, and some of the silent shots of characters regarding each other are a little hard to read. There are a lot of close ups of hands later in the movie, and they all look really lumpy and weird, but overall this a very pretty film.<br />
<br />
The movie soundtrack is pretty much the same as the show. I&#039;m not sure if they produced many/any new tracks for the background music, but the new Minmay song played at the climax is beyond beautiful. One benefit of condensing the series into a movie length is that we&#039;re not bombarded with &quot;My Boyfriend is a Pilot&quot; over and over again. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love that song, but I appreciate that they play it once to get it out of the way and then let Minmay sing new stuff.<br />
<br />
Now for the dub. What a magnificently awful dub! I wish it was bad enough to be enjoyable, but it starts to wear on you around half way through the run time. The delivery is flat across the board, but I&#039;m going to chalk that up to direction rather than acting capability because this seems like it was produced in the early days of anime dubbing. The VHS rip that I watched didn&#039;t help with its grainy audio, but it did make for a supremely dank aesthetic. I can only assume that the Japanese audio is better, so I can&#039;t wholeheartedly suggest watching it in English.<br />
<br />
In trying to compress the story of the original it removes a lot of things that annoyed me, but it also loses the exploration of themes that really captivated me. It cuts a lot of the fat to fast track the story and hit major plot points, opening a few episodes into the series and ending about 10 episodes shy of the series finale. One consequence of this is that it removes Minmay and Hikaru&#039;s first meeting, and makes it seem like their romance comes out of nowhere when they&#039;re stranded together. At one point Minmay does mention that she&#039;s loved Hikaru for a long time, but an uninitiated audience would have no idea how or why that is. This puts the emotional stakes in our love triangle a lot lower than in the series, because both of the girls just seem to be attracted to him because of his survival skills.<br />
<br />
Something else omitted for time is any tension between the Macross and the Earth government, again diminishing the political themes that used to be present. There is also absolutely none of the humans and Zentradi trying to rebuild and live together, which is honestly a solid choice, because that segment of the story already felt rushed in the series. This next point could be attributed more to direction than writing, but keeping track of who is fighting whom gets really difficult in the final battle. Additionally, the closing shot of the film doesn&#039;t seem to bring any kind of closure to the story, which really just confused me. Lastly, there are a couple of changes to the lore of the universe in the movie, but I think it will be up to the viewer to decide if these improve the story or not.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really get into discussions about how the characters are different without major spoilers, so suffice it to say that the character development pales in comparison to the series just due to the amount of time it has to work with. I think it does a pretty good job of choosing who to focus on most of the time, but for a more in depth evaluation I&#039;ll have a spoilerific paragraph at the end.<br />
<br />
So, who should watch &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot;? I really can&#039;t recommend it to people who haven&#039;t seen the series, because a lot of it will just seem pointless and hollow, but if you&#039;ve seen the original then you&#039;ve already seen the better version. So if you&#039;ve got a major urge to revisit some of the characters and ideas in the series, this is a nice visual treat that can give you a taste of it, but it&#039;s a pretty shallow revisitation.<br />
<br />
~~~SPOILERS~~~<br />
I was most engaged by the exploration and development of Hikaru&#039;s character over the years that the original story covered, but there isn&#039;t a lot of time to develop him here. He basically has a couple dog fights, camps out with each of the girls for a while, and then has to make a choice between them at the end. We don&#039;t get to see him struggle to make the right choices as much, so there isn&#039;t much reason hope for him to. Totally MIA in thus movie are the Zentradi spy trio (Which saddens me), Kaifun as a named character (So we can avoid the assheadded, creepy cousin vibe), Qamjin, and any real development of Hikaru&#039;s friends or Pineapple-chan. Max and Kakizaki are somehow even less of characters than they were before, and are really only there to show that Hikaru has friends in a couple scenes and is a normal young man, and then Max gets to have an epic showdown with Millia (Who is also never named) without any payoff after that. Focker&#039;s death was not nearly as impactful, because there wasn&#039;t enough time to develop his mentor relationship with Hikaru. Kakizaki suffers a similar fate, where he just isn&#039;t developed enough for his death to have any weight. Minmay has fewer chances to be stupid and selfish here, so I actually like her a lot more. Misa, on the other hand, is a lot weaker in this iteration. She mostly whines and wants to play house with Hikaru, and then manages to translate an ancient alien language by plot convenience. <br />

    My what a film and more of a rabbit hole than I anticipated.<br />
<br />
I first gained knowledge of the Macross universe through an AMV of Nanidato&#039;s &quot;Super Riser&quot; after being recommended it by chance upon finishing listening to &quot;Plastic Love&quot; for the 8 millionth time. At the time I didn&#039;t know what and AMV was and took straight to the comments to try and find out what the anime was so I could watch it for the amazing music, visuals, and most importantly the looks of Lynn Minmay. <br />
<br />
Upon scourging Google for &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross DYRL free&quot; I found the full movie on YouTube that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365281">
        was posted without any copyright claims!?!?!? <br />
<br />
Boy was I in for a surprise, not only did I figure out that the song was not in the movie but I realized a new obsession; I had come to love everything about this movie despite the music being an initial disappointment. Upon watching the movie I was hooked for more, so I watched it again and then began my quest to watch all of the episodes, movies, sub divisions, and the in-betweens of Macross which has in turn, fueled a small model obsession.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit that this movie and franchise isn&#039;t for everyone but it is important to take what you get from it and appreciate it. The visuals, art style and, character design were phenomenal for the time period and still cease to amaze me when I force a friend or colleague to watch it with me.<br />
<br />
Jets that turn in to robots and the memorable line &quot;Yack De Culture&quot; may not be your cup of tea, but I&#039;d consider giving DYRL a shot.

    This review is coming from someone who hasn&#039;t watched the series, I understand many of the flaws of the movie would be gone with the series, I&#039;ll probably go back and watch it eventually.<br />
<br />
As a film separate from the context of the full series it manages to stay quite cohesive throughout the run-time rarely losing me. However there are times where I think it really needed longer time with some of the characters and more time to really show the time between major events, but it does it&#039;s best and does it quite well.<br />
<br />
Love the aesthetic, it&#039;s probably what kept me the most interested. Despite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327740">
        being a movie revolving around singing I didn&#039;t really care for the singing. The relationships are just as expected, the characters act as you would expect aswell. The general theme is very much in the realm of anime, &quot;Love can save the universe&quot;. I kind of think it could have delved more into the ridiculous anime territory here but it was quite campy which is nice.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m still very much curious for the Macross Plus Movie, which is why I watched this in the first place. Oh yeah I also watched this with my HTC Vive VR Headset, with a slightly curved virtual screen, it actually enhanced some of the space shots and gave extra depth to some scenes.
