Life too stressful? Worried or anxious about something? Just sit down in front of the screen and put this anime on, and all your concerns will dissolve away - probably within seconds. Everything - setting, plot, sound, music, art, humour - all of it is perfectly crafted at maximising this effect. And what an effect it is.<br />
<br />
The story itself is a simple one. It follows the daily lives of four girls of various ages who all live in the same rural village and are in the same class at school. Almost everything that happens is following

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121139">
        their daily lives, with events that are both realistic and completely believable. As far as overarching story goes, that&#039;s about it - this isn&#039;t an anime you should be watching if you only care for a tense plot full of twists and turns. It is predominantly episodic in nature, although characters and settings are gradually built up over time so there&#039;s no lack of progress. Each episode contains one or two stories, every single one of which is a joy to watch and will melt your heart. The humour is lighthearted in tone, and is aimed at adding to this heart-melting effect, rather than at making you laugh out loud, although there are a few moments that could do this as well. There are also a few moments that will invoke other emotions, all very effectively and very naturally.<br />
<br />
The cast is focused mainly on the four girls. Komari is the eldest of the four, although you wouldn&#039;t know it by looking. She is very self conscious of the fact that she is unusually small for her age and tries to make up for this by attempting (and largely failing) to act grown up. Hotaru, on the other hand, is unusually mature, at least on a physical level, for a fifth grader. She also quickly develops a crush on her cute chibi senpai, although none of the others ever seem to realise it. Natsumi is Komari&#039;s younger sister, and is a bit of a layabout. She&#039;s too lazy to work hard at anything and is always getting in trouble for one thing or another. And then there&#039;s Renge, called &quot;Ren-chon&quot; by Natsumi. I could honestly wax lyrical about Ren-chon all day, but I don&#039;t want to bore you any more than I already am, so I&#039;ll just say that she&#039;s the youngest of the cast, who knows a lot about things that you wouldn&#039;t expect a first grade student to know, but otherwise acts fairly normally for her age. Oh, she also has some brilliant facial expressions, and Koiwai Kotori&#039;s voice acting of her character is a definite candidate for being the best I&#039;ve ever come across.<br />
Every member of the supporting cast, just like the main characters, each have their own distinctive but realistic and believable personalities, and are every bit as likeable as the central four cast members.<br />
<br />
The humour and characters may be brilliant, but what makes this series really stand out is the music and images. As someone who tends to focus very heavily on the characters of a series, I don&#039;t usually care much for these things - as long as they add to the immersement, enjoyment and feel of a series, just about anything&#039;s fine by me. But here even I can&#039;t help but be overwhelmed. The series starts with nothing but pictures, sound effects and music building up the scene and setting with pure imagery. It&#039;s almost 2.5 minutes before anything is actually said, yet by that time you will likely have already entered into a state of total bliss from the gorgeous artwork, more reminiscent of a high budget film or even something you might see in an art gallery than a TV series, and soothing background music and sound effects of what is being shown. And, while the effect may not be as intense in later scenes, the quality does not drop. Just about every background in this entire series is a work of art both literally and figuratively.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve watched the first episode over and over again and every time the effect is the same. The entire anime is thoroughly rewatchable, and every episode provides the perfect relaxation whether on your first watch or your tenth. Even brilliantly written series that depend on plot twists and reveals often grow dull when watching through for the third time, but that is of no concern for an anime like this.<br />
<br />
A lot of slower paced anime, however, require you to be in the right mood before watching them, but again that is of no concern here, as Non Non Biyori will put you in that right mood, no matter what your previous state of mind.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a series to be watched, loved and enjoyed over and over again. Everything is perfectly toned to add to this viewing pleasure as much as possible, and it is indeed a pure pleasure to watch.<br />
<br />
If you want to know what nirvana feels like, watch this anime.

    This is my first review, but I&#039;ll try my best to follow the guidelines.<br />
<br />
Ah. Non Non Biyori.<br />
<br />
To be honest, when I first saw the concept art and previews, I was not impressed. Frankly, I dismissed it as yet another slice of life show, a genre so regularly plagiarized that one can&#039;t help but wonder if the anime studios are running out of ideas, as each subsequent series seems to be a cut and paste of an earlier show. It was only with great encouragement from Youtube pianist Tehishter that I began watching the show with the lowest of expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125807">
        wrong I was.<br />
<br />
=Story 8/10=<br />
The story is a simple one. Hotarun, a Tokyo-bred city girl, finds herself moving out of the hustle and bustle of a metropolitan life and into the middle of the countryside thanks to her father&#039;s job transfer. There, she enrolls into a school that has only 1 teacher and 5 students of varying grades. Gradually, she grows accustomed to the joys of friendship and a peaceful lifestyle. That is pretty much it, story wise. Arguably, that is all it needs to be. <br />
<br />
While this might not sound like much, the writers did a fantastic job of painting a picturesque scene, albeit rather romanticized, of the differences between living in the countryside and living in the city. To roughly quote Ren-chon, &quot;Don&#039;t you own a mountain in the city, Hotarun?&quot;. There is an interesting element of comedic relief to the show as well, which does a good job of creating a light hearted and heart-warming experience altogether. It is exactly because of the lack of intricacies and complications that make this anime such a joy to watch. :)<br />
<br />
=Art 9/10=<br />
Being a show that revolves around country lifestyle, the show does a superb job of vividly painting the landscapes and creating a nice environment that truly sucks the viewer in. I was rather absorbed into the many beautifully done landscapes and views. The show, indeed, was full of screenshot worthy moments. The characters are nicely done as well. I for one, was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fan-service and the way the creators managed to maintain a very innocent image of the characters. <br />
<br />
=Sound 9/10= <br />
Ah. The soundtrack. I often see reviewers claim that a soundtrack is plain, boring or not memorable. I would argue otherwise. The sole purpose of a soundtrack is to immerse the viewer into the atmosphere of the show, to deliberate the mood and &#039;flow&#039; of the show. In this regard, the Non Non Biyori soundtrack does its job wonderfully. The subtle hints and ambient sounds that are played fit very well into the show. It suits the laidback and heartwarming theme of the show very well. As for the OP, it introduces the playful and childish mood of the overall show, which nano.ripe performs superbly. The ED is just adorable.<br />
<br />
=Character 7/10=<br />
The characters in the show are decent. I liked that the show did not introduce any stereotypes or overdo any of the characters. There&#039;s Hotaru, the classy but sweet city girl, the sisters Komari and Natsumi, and Renge, who make up the main cast of the show. They each have their varying quirks and personalities, all of which are interesting in their own ways. There is, surprisingly enough, some decent and well thought out character development, in particular, the relationship between &#039;sweet shop lady&#039; and Renge. I have personally lost count at how many times I&#039;ve let out an audible aww throughout this series. <br />
<br />
=Enjoyment 10/10=<br />
I love this show. No words can convey how I feel about this show, to be honest, but I&#039;ll try. Every week for the past 7 weeks, I looked forward to the airing of Non Non Biyori. Although I only got into the show halfway through the season, I was instantly hooked. I really enjoyed the laidback and calming experience that is Non Non Biyori. No matter how crappy or pissed off I felt at the time, I couldn&#039;t help but smile like an idiot after the show. Unlike other slice of life animes, Non Non Biyori is different in the sense that one truly feels at peace while watching the show. There is no drama or climax, no ante or distress. Watching the show was for me, pure bliss. 23 minutes of smiling like an idiot. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime does what it set out to do perfectly. Granted, some might not enjoy the lack of action or fan service, but let me say this. Give the show a try. If you&#039;ve had a crappy day at school, a disastrous meeting at work or if you just wanted to relax for a bit, watch this show. It&#039;s not the best show of the year, or even of the season, but it is special in its own right. <br />
<br />
9/10. <br />

    Yes, I have a sweet spot for slice of life anime. I genuinely enjoyed the laid-back shows such as GJ-bu, Tamayura, Yuyushiki etcetera this year, but that doesn&#039;t stop me from saying that Non Non Biyori was one of the most conformist and loveliest experiences in the past few months. It&#039;s definitely great-tier in the slice of life section. <br />
<br />
The simplistic story takes place in a rural area of the countryside. Eleven year old Hotaru Ichijou moves into the town from Tokyo with her parents, and transfers into a school consisting of only four more students; Renge, Natsumi and Komari (yes, it&#039;s a rather small

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125367">
        school). It shows the ordinary lives of these children, as well as other residents in the town throughout the seasons of the year.<br />
<br />
That is quite literally it.<br />
<br />
And hence is one reason why I love this show dearly. The story knows exactly what its purpose is; relaxation and healing. The execution of the countryside is depicted very well: The writing isn&#039;t complicated in the least, rather very simplistic, but the pacing and direction takes a gentle slow approach, and especially a faithful one to its original setting (it&#039;s based on a real place after all). Everything content wise is pretty much laid back, whether it&#039;s the lack of vehicles to rivers streaming, or doors without locks to shops without its shopkeeper (you pay in the money box!). The nature environment and gentle flow keeps this show consistently soothing, and each episode has the magic to ease you from anxiety or worries.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not all slice of life though, as its comedic factor takes a big role too. In its environment, it&#039;s very light-hearted comedy, carried by its characters heavily, but largely comedy based nevertheless. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a mix between Aria&#039;s slice of life aspect and Nichijou or Azumanga&#039;s comedic aspect, although more plausible than random. But the amount of laughing fit moments are high in its otherwise slow stretched content.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori doesn&#039;t illustrate any life messages at the end of every episode, unlike Aria or Tamayura, and its story doesn&#039;t particularly end on a high note either (which is good though because second season is possible). However, a few episodes can cause need of replacement for heartstrings, as the dedicated episodes can really warm and break the heart if you&#039;re not careful (which can consist of moments we can relate to too). But generally, the story presents the interactions and lives of our cast, and to lay back, eat ice cream and relax in ease is the best way to approach a series like this.<br />
<br />
In our cast we have the little grade 1, Renge, the two sisters Komari and Natsumi (grade 8 and 7) and Hotaru, grade 5. They all have pretty distinct personalities, although can be considered realistic. What makes watching them more interesting though is that they&#039;re all different ages and have different mindsets, so the interactions and chemistry between each of them together are often entertaining. Especially with Renge, because we&#039;re able to see a point of view of a child, not often expressed in anime, in which her childish mindset and logic can be quite ironic yet sweet. The characters pretty much drive the comedy factors forward, and you grow to care for them as the series gradually continues.<br />
<br />
I guess the lack of pandering and &#039;sexual&#039; fanservice is a strong trait of this show as well. The anime makes hardly any attempt to sexualize the characters (except the beach episode (which wasn&#039;t actually typical either (yes there&#039;s a beach in the countryside, deal with it))). The prohibition of panty and focus-on-body-parts shots makes them non-existent, and helps the faithfulness of this show to keep its soothing story from being ruined. It also ranges a better audience to non-anime fans (as the Japanese countryside people apparently like this show a lot!).<br />
<br />
I adore the animation in this show a lot. A lot of long pauses in this show makes up various, delicious wallpapers to use; it&#039;s like an impressive painting exhibition at times, with distinct, bright colours of nature in land and sky. Rivers sometimes flow, looking beautiful with reflections and sparkles. It just seems so fun to draw and paint some spectacular scenery, and such exhibitions are a complete plus in these kinds of shows. The shadings and lightning are handled very carefully too, and are the notable strengths in the art department. And of course, the budget is pretty high but that&#039;s to be expected with a slice of life shows as they usually are (there&#039;s lots of money to spend with not many scenes).<br />
<br />
Sound direction is done craftily great too. The soundtrack portrays a lazy yet calming mood for the show, sometimes being the center of the scene for a few times. The careful use of silence and sound effects suits the environment of the countryside, in which helps essence the lovely atmosphere this show has to offer at front. The voice actors deliver their lines well, whether it&#039;s a punchline or not. You&#039;d probably recognize Joshiraku&#039;s Marii in this, and Renge&#039;s VA coins the child character with ace. The OP and ED are generally enjoyable to listen to as well, and not once I skipped it.<br />
<br />
All in all, Non Non Biyori is definitely one of the better shows in its respective genre. It may look appealing to moe-inducers, but its environment and atmosphere is what sets itself apart from the typical slice of life anime with girls doing nothing. Its fun characters, lack of fanservice and soothing lazy pace helps the show in becoming a decent healing anime. And girls doing nothing it is, but as long as you have the right mindset and approach towards this show then it&#039;s highly enjoyable and comforting, especially when you&#039;re feeling down the dumps or blues. It&#039;s an anime that makes you smile; one that eases your tensity.<br />

This is why I love the slice of life healing genre.

         The slice of life genre was a captivating one. Having the ability to soothe the viewer. To give them that warm feeling inside. It was beautiful. But now slice of life is filled with big eyed, blob faced, cute girls. In other words, moe. If you don&#039;t know what moe is to put it simply its cute girls who do cute things. Although cute girls doing cute things isn&#039;t necessarily bad. Most lack a good story, meaningful characters,or both. In other words anime studios are focusing too much on making the show cute rather than focusing on the quality of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123217">
        the show itself.Sadly, these kinds of anime have slowly been increasing with each coming year. But among this moe epidemic. There are a few animes that rise above this trend and become a glint of hope for this dying genre.<br />
<br />
    Non Non Biyori is one of these animes.<br />
<br />
   The story is about a school in the countryside with only four students. All from different grades ranging from first to ninth. One day a transfer student called Hotaru Ichijou from Tokyo transfers to this school because of his father&#039;s job. The anime revolves around these girls and their life in the countryside.<br />
<br />
    The story runs out like other schoolgirl animes. It&#039;s episodic. But what makes this anime special is that every episode is skillfully crafted with great care to soothe the viewer and give the viewer a happy grin every episode. Almost every episode is realistic so there are many episodes where the viewer can relate to the show. Ever tried to hide a bad test score from your mom? or run away from your mom only to come back later? If you have then you will feel right at home with Non Non Biyori. Every episode is a beautiful adventure in itself. From playing ball on recess to making a cultural festival for less than five people. Every episode is fun, soothing, and a joy to watch.<br />
 <br />
    One look at Non Non Biyori and you know that silver link has put a lot of money into this anime. Movements are fluid. Designs are great, but what makes the art truly stand out is the background. The countryside is animated beautifully. The backgrounds feel alive. Everything from the trees to leaves falling. Even a river flowing is made with such detail. It&#039;s like the cross between art and realism. It&#039;s absolutely breathtaking.<br />
<br />
   The sound is (for a lack of a better term.) Just beautiful. Nano.Ripe brings us &quot;A rainbow colored day&quot;. A great opening that fits this anime perfectly. The soundtrack is also something to listen to. Every track fits every scene accurately. The piano tracks are truly something captivating, and certain instruments like the harmonica are used to give the viewer that countryside feel. The ending song doesn&#039;t have the same quality as the opening and the soundtrack but I warmed up to it after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
   The story, animation, and the sound in Non Non Biyori are all beautiful, but what propels Non Non Biyori to be truly special is the characters. The main cast of Non Non Biyori consists of 4 characters. Komari Koshigaya, Natsume Koshigaya, Hotaru Ichijou and Renge Miyauchi. Komari is an eighth grader who is very self conscious about her small and short body. Because fo this she tries to act grown up, usually without success. Then you have Komari&#039;s younger sister Natsume Koshigaya. A seventh grader who hates studying and likes to play. She&#039;s untidy, lazy, and her grades are terrible. She usually sees Komari as a younger sister than an older one because of her small body. Then you have Renge Chan. A talented and eccentric first grader. Although she usually acts like a typicall first grader. Ther are some parts that show off her talents and her eccentric parts. Words really can&#039;t describe her accurately. You just have to watch the anime for yourself. And last but not least you have Hotaru Ichijou. A fifth grade transfer student from Tokyo who is physically mature for her age.( Guys, you know what I mean.) She is polite and overal a nice person. But the twist is that she has a crush on Komari. Which is a basis for some of the comedy in Non Non Biyori.<br />
<br />
   One very interesting thing about Non Non Biyori is how it develops its characters. Now at face value these characters may seem somewhat stereotypical. But one thing that I really have to give Non Non Biyori credit for is its focus on fleshing out the characters. In every episode. You get to know more about the characters and they feel more and more alive and real as you get to know more about them and their interests, hobbies, and points of views. Their character designs may be cute, but Non Non Biyori doesn&#039;t rely on that to make characters endearing. It relies on fleshing out the character and making them have depth. I felt like I was with them right there. It is something that many anime fail to do, and it is truly stunning.<br />
<br />
   Non Non Biyori is definitely a beautifully crafted piece of art that should be viewed by not just fans of slice of life but fans of anime in general. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and experience the soothing experience known as Non Non Biyori.<br />
<br />
   You know that an anime is good when every episode makes you grin uncontrollably and gives you that warm feeling inside, and Non Non Biyori does exactly that.

    Who are we to decide that Slice of Life is a genre filled with shows that are all the same? Isn’t there still a batch of examples that still have those same aspects of what makes Slice of Life and even create a fresh atmosphere and aura to its world and characters? The answer is quite simply: yes. There are still shows of this nature that do provide more than just cute girls doing cute things, though there’s nothing inherently wrong about it. To this, Non Non Biyori is one such show that fits the category perfectly as an instant slice of life classic.<br />
<br />
One phrase

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126257">
        that perfectly summarizes the show as a whole would be, a breath of fresh air. I mean that too. If there is one thing that does distinguish Non Non Biyori from most shows like it is the pleasant atmosphere that engulfs the world of the show. From its character interactions being so grounded in a real-life, down-to-earth manner that makes it more memorable and so real to the environment to the subtle hints of its artistry to the backgrounds and characters.  With the plot detailing the issues of differentiating what city life is like than the rural countryside areas of society, it doesn’t necessarily paint a whole demonstrated structure of how the plot goes. But if you look at it further down the road, that isn’t very necessary for this show. It just lets the plot speak for itself through normal day dialogue rather than pointless exposition to explain anything since there’s hardly anything to tell in the first place. Sure, that might capsulize the slice of life genre as a whole, but Non Non Biyori is probably one of the few that does it better than the vast majority of them.<br />
<br />
What little plot that Non Non Biyori showcases make up for the excellent colorful cast of characters that make the show worthwhile to watch all the way through. Every single girl has a unique personality that distinguishes them from the rest in terms of how the writers build up to how their sense of humor is like in the comedy. They aren’t just this mesh of girls that have personality A, B, or C, the difference of character constructs them up to feel like real human beings that anybody can relate to whether it be from their disposition or their typical actions. Renge, for instance, is the youngest of the bunch and you’d think that they’d make her into this young girl who acts older than her elementary age, but it is, in fact, quite the opposite to this general aspect; at least in most cases to be specific. Her kindergarten mind ranges from being cute and curious that, in some cases, it can be construed to how come kids at her age act in a civil manner.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty breathtaking to look at considering how minimal the scope is to the show. It enhances the atmosphere greatly in its relaxed tone and inflection from how the characters look so crisp and clear from the actual colors and designs of them. The backgrounds especially give a wide range of detail into perfecting this countryside town in giving its structure more creativity and care to design how the characters live through their day-to-day lives.<br />
<br />
What’s unique about the comedy itself is how the timing is so minimal and slow that quickly makes the scenes more memorable just from the silence and pauses that last up to even about ten seconds. Again, the atmospheres help to the show’s credit with this in that the environment is so chill and down-to-earth that the jokes fit the anime perfectly, even with its mild attempts at trying to be wacky in a typical moe comedy fashion. That at least is always welcomed, thanks to the hilarious antics of Renge and Natsumi, who’s air-headed ways still tickles the moe-bone whenever her actions are on-screen.<br />
<br />
Casting couldn’t have been better to give these characters the voices that fit them very well to their archetypes. Highlights include Kana Asumi with her very distinct, sarcastic voice that matches very well to Komari’s senpai attitude that all the other girls look up to her. Ayane Sakura has made a name for herself in the seiyuu community by gracing her beautiful voice on the spotlight, and she has done it once again with Natsumi, a role that was begging to be played by her; though it would be interesting to hear someone like Yui Ogura to play her as well.<br />
<br />
For what it is, Non Non Biyori might be a big surprise for anyone who might be getting a little tired of the Slice of Life genre dominating the majority of the seasons lately. I am one of these people, though I don’t necessarily have any contempt or hatred to all of the shows like this, but Non Non Biyori is a clear sign that the genre definitely has a lot of things going for it and reminds us why it’s still considered a favorite genre for so many people. One thing that the show does do amazingly right in a slice of life is perfectly capturing what it was like to be a middle school aged kid. In that, it does want us to remember what it was like being at that age filled with mystery and friends, or lack thereof. Most slices of life fail to capture this essence but we finally have one, and its name is Non Non Biyori.<br />

    It doesn’t take a genius to figure out Non Non Biyori is a cute show about cute girls doing cute things. Even from the previews, discussion, and artwork, one can tell that the show depicts a slice of a life style circling a group of friends enjoying the time of their lives. It’s no surprise that they live happily without the burden of of saving the world, going through multi-love polygons, or killing titans. A life on the countryside is very relaxing and so is this series. Non Non Biyori brings you stories about a group of young girls having fun and living their lives

<br />
Non Non Biyori is an anime series based off of manga of the same name written by Atto. Silver Link handles the production that have recently achieved attention with their works such as Watamote, Fate/Kaleid, Dusk of Maiden etc. Likewise, these all share a similar setting taken place at school. However, Non Non Biyori doesn’t have the burden of living in a city where there’s crime, poverty, or hate; neither in the case does it evoke shock or horror. Instead, we got pleasurable atmosphere on the countryside where everyday is a brand new adventure.<br />
<br />
Calling this show ‘cute’ or ‘adorable’ isn’t uncommon. After all, the series gives off that sense of innocence with our schoolgirls as the main characters. The youngest one among them is Renge Miyauchi, a first grader with a rather perspective view of what’s around her. She also has a catchphrase ending many of her sentences with “na non”, a pun to the anime title. Renge can be defined as the show’s mascot as she is the youngest yet also the most eye catching character in many of the episodes. Among its other main character cast includes the shy Hotaru Ichijou, Natsumi, and Komari of the Koshigaya siblings. All of them have different personalities but shares a bonding friendship that connects them together.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori clearly lacks any directional plot but it sets up its premise well. We have Hotaru Ichijou, a shy 5th grade elementary schoolgirl who just recently moved to the countryside. Being the new kid at school isn’t easy especially with a class so small that all the students share the same classroom. There isn’t a big story going on but we can quickly tell that Hotaru tries to adjust to her new environment. Renge seems to be the welcoming director as she plays the role of welcoming Hotaru to the new class. It’s funny to see the position set up this way because of their age difference but a show like this pokes fun at anything. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having fun in this series because its style. It portrays the its slice of life genre quite well in this way and gives an appreciation to its settings and characters.<br />
<br />
The series also likes to poke the fun of the male population since there is almost none. Well, there is one guy in the show so far that is barely acknowledged for existence. His name is Suguru Koshigaya, a third grader with little presence at all. Unlike Kuroko from a certain basketball series, no one really seems to care about him either. <br />
<br />
Farm life isn’t always either so sometimes throughout the series, we witness the characters out on the sun doing field work. Only this time, the girls seems to be taking responsibility. Take Renge for example. She is only in the first grade but clearly demonstrates that she can be wise even at time compared to their schoolteacher. It’s laughable in this way since that means the majority of this series is dominated by the main characters rather than anyone else. And that would be true too as many of the times, we see our main characters in the spotlight with minimal amount of attention to other supporting characters. <br />
<br />
The series has a lot of comedy whether it might be the dialogues, responses, or character interactions. This is usually caused by misunderstandings, odd events, or situations. At the same time, there is also some tension bought out occasionally by Natsume. She plays more of a superior to others (especially her sister and brother) but at the same time is noticeable for her loving bond with everyone. There are also time when she tries to teach Renge some things not to be taught to a first grader. It’s amusing to watch since the parents are almost in the complete background while the kids tries to play a role in guardianship. <br />
<br />
Despite its cuteness, the show can be somewhat repetitive to watch. There’s also a lack of exploration in any of the characters’ backgrounds. It seems to clearly focus on its slice of life style while retaining its cute interpretations. While, there’s minimal fan service and negates the harem trope (despite there being one main male character), there’s still the typical beach episode. Additionally, most of the episodes seems to lack any purpose or moral as they are all standalone. As the show is also focused directly at the countryside, there’s nearly hardly anything else new besides the farm setting that is focused on. However, there are settings such as the house where the characters live, the school (with only one classroom being the focus),  a sunny beach, and a shrine. Typical as it is, the show doesn’t try out new or exciting features that sets foot outside its SOL zone.<br />
<br />
Artwork wise, Silver Link did an excellent job with its production with rich visuals. The countryside is presented with a calm atmosphere that illustrates the nature of being simple. Indeed, it’s nothing like the heavily populated cities where there is pollution, crime, or poverty. Instead, there’s a relaxing life with our four girls. Speaking of the girls, most of them are designed with a charming presence. Their diverse colored hairs and simple clothing contrasts with the stereotypical valley girl with heavy makeup. It’s beautiful in its own way and that’s what important.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack isn’t very impressive but sends its message well with the calm atmosphere. Most of the time, the OST is lighthearted whether it’s with character interactions, conversations, or just the girls having fun. There are a few moments when we witness some more tense moments although most of this is downplayed as comedy because the show itself is created to bring out laughter and joy. The OP song “Nanairo Biyori” by nano. Ripo is decorated with cuteness while its ED song has an unique style where the cast members whom plays the characters in the show sings its theme. Speaking of which, I also find most of the characters’ voices to match well. Rie Murakawa brings out that voice of shyness in Hotaru’s character while Kotori Koiawai portrays Renge as who she exactly is. <br />
<br />
In the end, this series is probably one of those anime that is overlooked compared to other mainstream series. Underrated wouldn’t be a word I’d describe Non Non Biyori. Instead, it’s something that is likely slipped under people’s radars. The fact that slice of life series with cute girls doing cute things has become a repetitive tropes in recent years. However, that idea can still be appreciated thanks to the characters of this series. The way they live countryside is simple and doesn’t bring out a stressful way of portraying life. There is a lack of story depth but if one can overlook that will learn how to appreciate the way this series presents itself. It reaffirms the style of a slice of life anime without going over the bar. Sometimes in life, you just want to relax a bit and enjoy something simple. Luckily, there’s shows like Non Non Biyori that can give just what you deserve. <br />

    Anime can fulfil many roles and act as many outlets for people. Non Non Biyori, simply put, is an experience that plays on the sweeter side of us all. For someone looking for a soothing, relaxing, cute and humorous adventure, there&#039;s a lot to get out of Non Non Biyori. Lovers of the moe slice of life genre will find something to love in this anime for sure. <br />
<br />
Story: (7/10; Not important): The thing about Non Non Biyori and many other slice of life that come in this style is that there is no real deep plot line filled with twists and turns. The free-flowing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125285">
        nature of the anime accentuates the calm and easy-going mood of the characters as living in the country-side. For a brief summary, Tokyo student Hotaru suddenly moves to the country side, and finds herself in a situation where she must adapt to life in the country side, where there&#039;s one candy shop, the supermarket has no cashiers and the classes are all mixed into one. The beauty of the story shines in the fact that it gives the anime lots of room to work, and a lot of situations are covered, allowing for the characters to fully shine and do what moe slice of life should do, be funny, be relaxing and bring into the world that&#039;s different than yours. <br />
<br />
Art: (9/10): The art in the anime is beautiful. The country side is depicted very well, with a hefty amount of colors drawing from light color palettes. The art helps to enhance the mood as the backgrounds are intricate and the characters all have distinguishing details about them. Non Non Biyori shows the great potential of Slice of Life art in a heavy nature setting. <br />
<br />
Sound: (9/10): The setting of Non Non Biyori also plays heavily into the sound portion of things. You will commonly and frequently hear birds chirping in the morning and the sound of flowing water in streams and ponds. Along with that the soothing soundtrack filled with woodwind and acoustic guitar pieces will certainly only add to the experience. The music never really seems out of place in Non Non Biyori and it really helps to bring out the setting as well as define the characters. <br />
<br />
Characters: (10/10): What makes or breaks a slice of life anime is usually the characters. If the characters are interesting, then the SoL probably won&#039;t be interesting. Luckily for us, Non Non Biyori has four very good characters. Each one of the characters has a unique personality, whether it be Hotaru&#039;s polite manner with an obsession over her senpai, or Renge with her fun-loving and care-free personality. You will quickly love all the characters, and find favorites among them, and they all have their moments which is something that Slice of Life animes in general should strive to do. They really shine in their interactions with each other and the way they tackle certain situations in a setting that should be pretty unfamiliar to most of us. The characters are light-hearted and happy, and are memorable until the end, offering a great experience for viewers. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10/10): Even without a compelling and gripping plot, Non Non Biyori captured my heart immediately, and took me into the world of the Japanese country side. The characters made me laugh and for the brief 24 minutes, separated me from the stress of the real world. If you ask me, there is nothing more that a Slice of Life anime should strive for than this. The ability to grip the viewer in lack of a major plot and distract them from the real world with a thoroughly enjoyable environment with great characters.<br />
<br />
Overall: (8.5/10): It was really hard for me to choose between an 8 and a 9 here, so I figured I&#039;d take the diplomat&#039;s road and give it right in the middle. Being an overall fan of anime, no matter what the genre, I always appreciated the drawn out, epic and mysterious plots of some of the very highly rated anime on MAL. However there will always be a place for Slice of Life anime, especially moe SoL. Fit with four very adorable characters, a unique setting, and many funny and cute experiences to treasure, I feel that Non Non Biyori will stand as one of the staples of moe slice of life anime. What&#039;s not to love? If you&#039;re feeling down, or want to please your sweet tooth of anime, go ahead, give Non Non Biyori a try. Come for the premise, leave with the interactions of four great characters. <br />
<br />

    I honestly feel quite bad that I&#039;m giving this such a low rating compared to everyone else. But oh man... I had to finish this anime on double speed just so I can finish it... <br />
I am not a huge fan of slice of life, but I don&#039;t hate it either. And since Renge is such a meme on the interwebs, I decided to watch it... But oh my goodness. Definitely not MY cup of tea.<br />
<br />
(Since this is a slice of life and there practically is no plot, I&#039;ll just decide to give 5/10.) I thought the  art was quite nice. The scenery was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219894">
        peaceful, the characters were quite cute, no doubt about that. The sound was... Alright. There was nothing memorable, in my opinion anyway. But oh, the characters... The characters. The only thing that&#039;s stopping me from giving it a 1/10 is Hotarun and Suguru, and I&#039;ll explain why. <br />
<br />
This is just my personal opinion, but I personally detest characters who act/are way stupider than their age. And I know anime is never realistic, but this was just WAY too much. Maybe it&#039;s because the characters grew up on the countryside without proper education, but honestly... Really? The idiocy of the characters weren&#039;t cute to me at all, it just pissed me off. (It makes sense that my favorite loli character is Shiro from NGNL, who I believe is around the same age as Komari.) I really should have just dropped it at the first couple of episodes, but the reason I stuck with it was the older brother. He was literally my favorite character even though he didn&#039;t speak a word. And at least, Hotarun was bearable... Although she was also way too mature for her age (physically and psychologically), it was better than having such stupid characters trying to go through their daily life. I felt my brain cells dying one by one as I was trying to watch this normally, and soon I was watching it at 4 times the original speed.<br />
<br />
 Although the characters&#039; designs were cute, I felt like I was watching a kids&#039; show. Renge is still a good meme, but this anime personally didn&#039;t fit my taste. However feel free to watch it if you&#039;re a huge slice of life fan.

    I felt at a loss when I looked at this season&#039;s anime lineup. It seemed crowded with a lot of action and supernatural-oriented shows, two genres I don&#039;t generally mesh well with, so when I saw Non Non Biyori it instantly stood out. Being a fan of the gentle, Ichigo Mashimaru-styled slice of life style, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. <br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
Story is never a strong suit in a genre that is based around nothing really happening. Non Non Biyori doesn&#039;t bring profound storyboard elements to the table, but you can&#039;t really expect that. It instead seems to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review119529">
        offer very subtle undertones based on the premise of country life. The show follows Ichijou Hotaru, a 5th grader who has moved from the city to the country, and her friends, who happen to be the only other gradeschool children in town. Concepts of culture shock are touched upon lightly in Hotaru&#039;s occasional confusion of life in the country, and the connection between the main characters seems strengthened by the loneliness of being in such an underpopulated location. Story is taken lightly, as I feel it should be.<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
Mother of all that is holy, those backgrounds. I feel this is one of Non Non&#039;s strong suits, that being the art. A peaceful, countryside setting offers stunning scenery, and this show does not shy away from taking advantage of that. The first part of the first episode greets us with a collage of beautiful mountains coated in trees, gentle streams, and peaceful fields. The style of the characters themselves is solid and very cute, and the animation is fluid and consistent.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10<br />
The soundtrack of Non Non complements the atmosphere of the show very well. It&#039;s peaceful, quaint, and traditional. The only complaint I have is the more intense music in episode 5, but it wasn&#039;t very much of a big deal. The voices of the characters are pleasant and fitting.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9/10<br />
Here&#039;s where the slice of life genre shines, and Non Non doesn&#039;t fail to deliver. The anime is centric around four characters; Ichijou Hotaru, a mild-mannered fifth grader from the city, Koshigaya Natsumi, the playful sixth grader, Koshigaya Komari, the older sister of Natsumi, and Miyauchi Renge, the eccentric first grader. Each character has something interesting about them, such as Hotaru&#039;s loving obsession with her senpai Komari, Komari&#039;s sensitivity about her short stature, Natsumi&#039;s carefree nature, and Renge&#039;s... well, a lot about her is interesting. These traits are brought out through the interactions between characters in a fun, natural way.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
I really enjoy this show. It has the peace of a really gentle slice of life, but surprisingly has the ability to get me laughing or even tearing up a bit (looking at you, episode 4.) It achieves this in a subtle way that I just love to experience.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
I look forward to future episodes of Non Non Biyori. It&#039;s certainly my favorite anime of the season, and for good reason. If you liked Ichigo Mashimaru, then I feel you&#039;d enjoy this show too.

    When first encountered by Non Non Biyori, I instantly had the thought that something mediocre were to appear as with (obviously a biased perspective) most modern slice of life shows. Boy was I wrong though, because if you&#039;re anything like me and enjoy a good, relaxing slice of life show that makes you feel good, cosy and just want to keep watching... Well, you&#039;re in the right place.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori revolves around a really simple story, where we&#039;re met by Renge and her friends, and we follow them throughout their daily lives in the sticks. It really doesn&#039;t get any more complex than that, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178748">
        it&#039;s one of the main reasons as to why I had such a great time watching this show. You don&#039;t have to worry about figuring some mystery out, or the story having any real plotholes for that matter. To me, a slice of life show should be as simple as possible and focus on the characters that make the show enjoyable, which is the case in this anime.<br />
<br />
On first look I was met with stunning visuals. I really recommend watching this in 720p or above, if you have the opportunity to. The artwork really is splendid, and they focus a whole lot on drawing beautiful scenery and backgrounds, something that you might not necessarily focus on but it does add a nice touch. The characters are animated in a high quality fashion as well, although it&#039;s debatable whether or not the derpy faces are &quot;high quality&quot;. I think they are, however, since the exaggeration of expressions is sort of... Out of character? It makes for a great laugh when used properly.<br />
<br />
Another great aspect that sort of caught me off guard was how good the music fits in this happy-go-lucky show. If you&#039;ve seen Hanasaku Iroha and recognize the opening, that&#039;s because it&#039;s the same artist. I also get the same vibe as I did from Hanasaku Iroha as I do for Non Non Biyori, which might be a factor in this subjective review, but the music really does wonders. Although simple, it suits the (more often than not) quirky situations depicted. Great when it&#039;s time to laugh, and great when it&#039;s time to feel good or emotional.<br />
<br />
In general, however, the far most important moment that makes Non Non Biyori excel are the characters. They&#039;re all unique with their own traits, good and bad, and they all share a common element; they&#039;re all quirky, to some degree. You really get to bond with them as well during the course of the show, something I really appreciated. The show really wouldn&#039;t be the same without them, which should be obvious considering that it&#039;s slice of life, but it&#039;s not as obvious in other shows (the way I see it).<br />
<br />
So, to summarize, Non Non Biyori is a wonderful, short story about Renge and her friends&#039; daily lives and struggles. With a simple story, stunning visuals, sound fit for the situations and characters that you just want to see more and more of, Non Non Biyori instantly hooks you on and before you know it you&#039;ll have watched the 12 episodes. Twice. A slice of life done right.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t help but give this anime 10/10.

    Nothing can be objectively good, but enjoyment has to come from somewhere. Non Non Biyori is an anime that I really enjoyed but I don’t know exactly why. I will be comparing it to other anime to see if I can figure out exactly what made it so enjoyable to me.<br />
<br />
The story in Non Non Biyori is pretty simple: it’s about a girl from Tokyo who moves to a rural part of the country, likely a hamlet. Although it’s supposed to be about her getting used to her new lifestyle, this intent is lost fast and just like Akari from Yuru Yuri she eventually doesn’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236563">
        even seem like the protagonist anymore. It’s not really a problem since in my opinion this anime works better with a group lead than a single protagonist at the head of the group, but the character introduced as the protagonist does seem to have the least characterization out of the main cast. It’s a common theory that the setting is what makes it so enjoyable because it’s relatable, but Tamako Market takes place in a town much more similar to my own and it wasn’t anywhere near as enjoyable. I had some problems with Tamako Market since the main character was the only one with decent character development and generally not much going on, but there wasn’t anything I can remember specifically about it that would make it that much worse than Non Non Biyori. The story of moving to a different place is a story that I can connect to since I once lived in Costa Rica for six months which has a very different culture and atmosphere than my own, but the exchanges in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Kiniro Mosaic, and Ikoku Meiro no Croisée The Animation are much more similar to the situation I was in and I didn’t enjoy any of them quite as much as Non Non Biyori. I definitely had problems with these anime as well: I didn’t like the harem ending of Sakurasou, the accents in Kiniro Mosaic made the series feel fake, and Labyrinth felt more like a Japanese dub since it’s set in France with French characters.<br />

The art style could be a reason to like Non Non Biyori, after all the characters are very well designed and the background art is beautiful especially for such a long series. Starting with the character designs they all have realistic hair colours save Renge who despite having purple twintails fits in nicely with the art style. They’re obviously drawn as lolis and are never sexualized. They would make better younger sisters than girlfriends. The eye size is pretty typical for a seinen moe anime and although it obviously isn’t realistic it could arguably be the most attractive eye size in anime. Apart from Renge’s triangle mouth their faces all look fairly similar, but their face shapes are still distinct enough that their hair isn’t the only thing you can use to tell their head shots apart. The brother looks like a fairly generic anime boy and since he doesn’t even have a voice actor I haven’t felt any reason to remember his name. The two older characters Kaede, the candy store lady, and Kazuho, the teacher, have more unique designs than the main cast. Aside from how different the characters look from each other they all do have memorable designs even for a veteran of the moe genre such as myself. I wouldn’t necessarily consider Non Non Biyori’s designs to be my favourite designs, though. Anime adapted from video games such as Kantai Collection, Hyperdimension Neptunia, and Idolmaster have more attractive designs in my opinion. Apart from Aikatsu and Steins;Gate I can’t remember any anime adapted from a video that was actually well made especially in terms of competing against Non Non Biyori. Kantai Collection dragged out and although it’s lackluster storyline wasn’t any worse than Non Non Biyori’s absence of a solid story it still felt far less satisfying and halfway through I felt no drive to complete it. Hyperdimension Neptunia has some of the most beautiful character designs I’ve seen, but the story fails to be engaging and as fun as the characters are to be with it wasn’t that enjoyable of an anime. Idolmaster does have some character development and the story has some substance to it, but with 14 main characters and only 25 episodes it doesn’t have enough time to give any of them that deep of characterization. Aikatsu I already consider to be better than Non Non Biyori so its strengths and weaknesses are irrelevant. Steins;Gate is adapted from a visual novel with a story that has many paths but only one of which was adapted into the anime. The story is good, the characters are designed well, and it’s incredibly enjoyable, but for whatever reason I still rank it below Non Non Biyori. Steins;Gate is a very different series from Non Non Biyori, but the reasons I liked the two series still share a considerable amount of overlap. Both of the anime have likable characters and are set in a fairly small yet well developed area. Steins;Gate explores its setting by showing the characters changing the very world they live in through sending simple text messages and Non Non Biyori explores its setting by showing the characters travelling around through their little village and using different ways to indicate just how far apart different parts of their village are from each other. If the character design truly was the thing that made the anime so enjoyable then High School Fleet, the other anime Atto provided character designs for, should have been as enjoyable, but I found that anime to be quite mediocre.<br />

The background art is very detailed, pretty, and shiny for an anime of its length. The three Makoko Shinkai films I’ve seen, Five Centimetres Per Second, Your Name, and Garden of Words have just as beautiful of backgrounds if not more beautiful, but as movies they only have so much time to make an impact and as good as their art was the stories in them were either too complicated for their runtime or otherwise weren’t quite as strong as what you would see in a series. The personalities of the characters aren’t too detailed and only serve as ways to move the plot forward rather than being important contributions to the enjoyability of the anime. The three anime series I distinctly remember as having as good of background art as Non Non Biyori are Yama no Susume, Glasslip, and Anohana. I know, it’s not everyday that someone would willingly compare their favourite anime to Glasslip, but I think it’s for the best. The first season of Yama no Susume has good backgrounds but is too short to draw any conclusions from; the second season I consider to be better than Non Non Biyori and therefore isn’t important for comparison. Glasslip is infamous for being far more uneventful than even anime like K-On! and Lucky Star. I think it would be safe to say that even if the background art was among the most important factors towards my enjoyment that all of the turn-offs in Glasslip would make it unenjoyable to even the people who valued background art the most, but there are still some people who enjoy Glasslip sincerely so it can’t simply be turned down as an anime impossible to enjoy no matter what your tastes. Not only does Glasslip not have any real characterization, but the intent of it being a supernatural romance is sort of forgotten about and nothing really happens throughout the series. In addition to no value in the storytelling there also weren’t any successful attempts at comedy. Anohana is a much better anime than Glasslip, but it still fails in a number of ways. The characters were interesting and well drawn, but the story of a dead friend who only the protagonist was incredibly unrealistic. My theory that Menma’s spirit was actually audio-only and Jintan was simply imagining her in physical form was shattered by the end due to conflicting information. Non Non Biyori doesn’t have any unexplained supernatural elements to bother me, but even anime with seemingly flawless magic systems like Death Note and Shigofumi rank lower on my list, but I won’t go into explaining those.<br />
<br />
What makes the background art so important in Non Non Biyori is where the anime takes place. The setting is quite unique and it’s the only slice of life anime I’ve seen set in a such a unique place that doesn’t have something to do with careers. Shirobako, Bartender, and Barakamon have similar settings, but Shirobako and Bartender are fairly slow and information heavy. Barakamon I saw right after Non Non Biyori and although there wasn’t really anything wrong with it I still didn’t enjoy it quite as much. As I was explaining before, Non Non Biyori does a lot with its small world. Unlike anime such as Sword Art Online and Gurren Lagann that have too big of a world to handle correctly the characters and the director do a good job at getting you to know where everything is without having to go everywhere in near-real time like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Having too small of a world can also be a problem. Seitokai no Ichizon takes place in a single room for the first few episodes and even when they do the school doesn’t feel as natural or well laid out as the village in Non Non Biyori. I actually found the comedy in Seitokai no Ichizon to be comparable to if not better than the comedy in Non Non Biyori, but I still didn’t think it was as good of an anime. The protagonist in Elemi is an inanimate object so naturally the movement in the anime was extremely limited no matter how good the writing was.<br />
<br />
All of the places in Non Non Biyori feel like places I could really go to. The candy store not only reminds me of real candy stores that I’ve been to but the aesthetic of it and the way everything is organized truly feels so well put together that even if I hadn’t seen other stores like it that wouldn’t make it any less believable. The bridge they jump off of feels nostalgic despite the fact that I’ve only done things in real life that were remotely similar. The scene is written in a way that I could see myself in that situation just through the shared sense of that kind of childish innocence. When they go to the little hole in the wall and talk about how they had done that before when they were younger I relate to that sense of nostalgia in a way that I haven’t really seen in other anime. Sure, there are some anime that I saw as a kid and are pieces of my childhood and therefore nostalgic to look back on, but I can’t remember any other anime that really go into that sense of realistic nostalgia the characters have around things in their own world. Dagashi Kashi did that a bit, but the monster of the week style of it made it feel a bit too fake for it to hit me in that same way. I have very strong memories of playing with my cousin up at his dad’s (or my uncle’s) cabin. In the summer we played around the lake getting mucky, we went under a bridge and blew up firecrackers that we stuck to the bridge with clay, and we found tadpoles in the pond. In the winter we used the firecrackers in the snow, we went on the frozen lake on snowmobiles, and we sledded down hills on waxed cardboard. We also play games like the “suicide notes” game where we would jump off a loft and say why were killing ourselves and then would drink something to “revive” us. These years didn’t just blend into one another since I would look forward to the next time I would go up there and would always go with fond memories of the previous trips. The nostalgia wasn’t just additive, it was magnified through the nostalgia of nostalgia itself. The characters have cell phones and are obviously living in the modern day and age, but you can still watch the anime as if it is through the eyes of the characters looking back on their childhood.<br />
<br />
The designs of the school uniforms and the buildings themselves are rather unique. One important thing to note is that since the school has both elementary school and middle school students they don’t all wear the same uniform, in fact if weren’t for the flashback that showed Kaede wearing the uniform it could have been assumed that it was just how Natsumi and Komari’s parents decided to dress them. In the whole school there is only one male, but it isn’t a harem and not only is he not that important of a character he doesn’t have single line and is only used for comedy. With the male and female uniforms in consideration they’ve both designed nicely. Renge and Hotaru don’t wear the uniform but the clothing they do wear looks good. The school’s design is quite interesting. It’s quite small and only has a few rooms. It feels quite natural and as poorly as it is taken care of the internal structure isn’t too chaotic. For a schoolgirl not too much of the anime takes place in the school. I think this works to its benefit since their lives outside of school are more interesting, but the time they’re shown in school isn’t wasted and their pathetic excuse for a teacher is charming in her own way.<br />
<br />
Apart from anime based around music like So Ra No Wo To and Nerima Daikon Brothers it can be hard to know just how much the quality of the sound is affecting your enjoyment, but I feel like the voice acting and background music in this anime really did make a difference. This is an anime I think would lose a lot in an English dub if it were to ever receive one. The very first scene has Renge playing a recorder completely out of tune, which sets the tone for the series very well. Renge’s “nyanpasu” doesn’t have any nice sounding English equivalent, sort of like how off Nico’s “Nico-Nico-Nii” sounds in the English dub of Love Live. Like most moe anime the cuteness of their voices is just as important to the series as the cuteness of their character designs. Komari’s slight tsundere lilt has a nice sound to it even if her personality doesn’t feel super realistic. Little things like rocks being thrown and water splashing all sound realistic enough but also don’t have that problem where instead of imagining the sound in their world you would be able to tell that someone had to use a microphone to create that sound effect. Renge’s voice doesn’t have as big of a range as the other characters, but she still expresses a lot of emotion. Chocotto Sister and Saki I also liked the voices, sound effects, and music in, but they just didn’t feel like as strong of series overall.<br />
<br />
What analysis would be complete with taking apart the animation of the opening theme? As much as I doubt a good OP could provide the sole enjoyment for a show especially considering how good the OPs for anime like Absolute Duo,  Lord Marksman and Vanadis, and Golden Time were compared to how little I actually enjoyed those anime, but I do believe the openings to this were really well made and at least made some contribution to my enjoyment of the anime. The OP starts off by showing the river the series is set near which gives a bit of information about the setting right off the bat since you wouldn’t normally see rivers like that in the city, especially without any pollution and being surrounded by rocks rather than concrete. I know the OP doesn’t actually start at the beginning of the first episode, but it still does give a good introduction to the series in addition to what we see of the anime before the OP starts. After the first shot we are shown the sky with clouds to further the idea that this is set in the semi-wilderness of a quaint hamlet. The title is shown in a colourful and bubbly font similar to the kind that an elementary school student might use to write their name. I think this might be nodding towards the fact that the main characters are younger than our typical 15-17 year olds these anime tend to revolve around. We see a can being kicked, a reference to the popular kids’ game “kick the can”, and then shows Natsumi with a grin implying that she was the one who kicked it. The students start running and the teacher stands there dazed as if ignorant to her job as “it” or even to the rules of the game in general. Throughout the series the teacher is constantly shown as being less competent than the students she has been assigned to teach so her inability to suppress her apathy in order to just properly play a game with some children says a lot about her character. Considering how unathletic she has been shown to be it’s surprising that the can even needed to be kicked in the first place, but she obviously didn’t do a good job at protecting it. Even with their failure of a teacher playing the key role in their game, they still seem to be enjoying themselves more than any normal adult has in years. They try hard to run away as fast as they can even though “it” is making no effort to chase after them whatsoever. How easy it is for them to have fun really plays into the series and in a way can even metaphorically describe how I feel about the series as a whole since despite how little seems to be going on in it the anime is still extremely enjoyable. The next scene shows the students playing music, cooking, and playing all under the limited supervision of their teacher. Although the teacher has her eyes permanently closed, she is shown to be sleeping in the last of these three events by having a bubble coming out of her nose and giving her a more joyous look on her face than usual. Again, the kids seem to be enjoying these activities, but considering how poorly Renge was shown playing the recorder in the first scene it’s a given that whatever skills they’re meant to be learning in these situations are taught in an ineffective manner. They are then shown walking in the rain with umbrellas and next the picture changes to a puddle showing the kind of weather that they typically get in that area. They are then shown relaxing in the shade of a tree with a ball visible showing that they were playing some sort of game and got tired. We then see a train go by in the background and it is shown that Hotaru was riding it. I think this is used to show the cultural distance between her and the other characters. She looks solemnly at the scenery through the window as it passes by. Natsumi is shown sitting on a tree branch and looking out at the sunset. The next image shows Komari inside reading a book while hiding away from the rain, which is clearly a common occurrence in the place they live. Renge hangs up a teru teru bozu, a Japanese spiritual ornament intended to keep the rain away. This not only shows that she would rather it not be raining despite relying somewhat on the rain for crop growth but also that she believes this little handmade figure will actually work to make the skies clear again. Although in Japan the teru teru bozu is a well known symbol we don’t see it in many anime. I’m going to speculate that most teenagers in Japan don’t trust this figure to help any and considering all the other Japanese cultural traditions that rely on faith that Japanese teenagers will participate in I think this specific one is likely seen as particularly childish. The four main characters are then shown lined up on a bridge and they take turns jumping into the river. Hotaru is reluctant to join at first, but she quickly gives. This scene is also shown in the series, but I wouldn’t call it a spoiler simply because of the apparent storyless structure of the anime. The manga wasn’t even adapted chronologically, hence the name “Repeat” for the sequel, and it never really needed to be since it’s not important what order the events happened in. I think it’s pretty obvious what this scene is meant to show. Hotaru isn’t too into this idea, but she still wants to join her friends in an activity that they’re all used to. The next scene shows the characters staring blankly at the camera for a couple seconds before eating what look like cookies in perfect unison. This could be to show how in sync they’ve become, but even without any deeper meaning they looking really cute doing that together. Natsumi and Renge have a snowball fight. Natsumi misses her shot and Renge picks a snowball far too big for her to feasibly use as a weapon. Natsumi looks frightened, but seeing the way Renge staggers back it doesn’t look like she would be able to throw it very far if at all. In the background we see Komari crying while Hotaru cleans the snow off of her that she was once covered with. We never see this full scene in the show itself, but even this little snapshot makes for an interesting tale. The concept of a girl having snow piled onto her fits in with the show so well I wouldn’t be surprised if it was something from the manga that simply wasn’t able to be adapted. We end with Natsumi jumping on large colourful tires that have been positioned to be played on. The scenes are set up in a way to show all four seasons of the year wrapped up into 90 seconds. I don’t pay enough attention to opening animations to give examples of similar openings to compare this to.<br />
<br />
Like most slice of life anime this puts a very big importance on the characters, both how likable they are as individuals and how they interact with each other. I will be talking about the four main characters as well as the more prevalent supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Hotaru is introduced to us as the main character. She’s from Tokyo as are 25% of the total population of Japan and the majority of the anime studios. She lives with her parents and has a healthy family relationship, much like the rest of the characters. Although the parents aren’t too important of characters, it is important to note that they’re all alive and still together since a lot of anime feature main casts that don’t have complete families. One of Hotaru’s defining features is how mature she looks for her age. Personality wise she more closely matches her chronological age than her visual age. She has a crush on Komari even to the point of making plush dolls of her. This seems more like yuri fanservice than a legitimate attempt to give her character more depth, but even if it does break the illusion of reality it still never bothered me. In fact, I found this little bit of romance to be kind of cute.<br />
<br />
Renge is a rather unique character. Some call her the most realistic child in anime, although she still isn’t quite as believable as Rin from Usagi Drop. She is significantly younger than the rest of the main cast, but they still manage to be normal friends without seeing her as being less important. She does have certain childish needs that the others will often have to cater to. She acts like a bit of a younger sister to all of them even though the only other character related to her is their teacher. Pretty much everything she does looks so heartwarming and innocent that it’s easy to ignore how weird she would look in real life. She could be referred to as a loli, but she isn’t sexualized in any way. This anime is made for adult men and much unlike anime such as Ro-Kyu-Bu the characters are intended to be as innocent and realistic as would make sense for the context. Considering the fact that school swimsuits are more fetishized in Japan than bikinis it still could be considering sexual in that way, but it would still be disturbing for people to fap to it.<br />
<br />
Komari isn’t exactly a cliche character, but she does follow a lot of tropes. She has a strong complex around being a loli and doesn’t like being the older sister who looks like a little kid. Just like Ed from Fullmetal Alchemist she freaks out about her height frequently and although as a comedy anime this isn’t exactly misplaced it is a pretty generic character trait. It’s supposed to be funny, but since any audience member who has seen at least a handful of anime like this is already used to that joke it loses its value as a joke and just becomes an annoyance. Just like any other moe or harem anime she complains about her breast size and she is envious of Hotaru who has much larger breasts than her despite a few years younger. Unlike Lucky Star, Toradora, and Yuru Yuri that were willing to go so far to actually turn the flat chestedness of a character into an important part of the show or even a major plot point this anime just passes it off as something you should come to expect from these types of anime and doesn’t do anything with it. I’m not saying that Chuu Bra is a good anime because it was brave enough to make its entire plot revolve around breasts, but I think it’s better if an anime actually does something with the tropes it incorporates rather than just inserting harem light novel humour into an anime where that isn’t warranted. These things wouldn’t be so much of a problem if she had more going on, but the fact is that her entire character is based around the standard imouto stereotypes. For whatever reason none of this bothered me all that much when I was watching the series. In retrospect I recognise that she wasn’t that well written, but unlike Sword Art Online that I’ve come to consider much worse upon noticing its flaws after the fact this hasn’t made me feel like any of my enjoyment was any less deserved than when I watched the anime. She has yaeba and considering the fact that the town hasn’t been shown to have a hospital or even a properly functional school I don’t think anyone would care to “fix” it or even see it as a problem that needs a solution.<br />
<br />
Natsumi is Komari’s younger sister and is the youngest child in her family. Surprisingly despite how realistic this anime is said to feel she’s the only character in the main cast who doesn’t just feel like some anime character. This isn’t to say that she’s a boring character, though. She acts exactly how you would expect a girl her age to act. You could see it as a good thing that they aren’t all just normal people because it does make their characters a bit more fun even if they wouldn’t fit well in reality. She takes good care of Renge and generally gets along well with the other characters. As shown in the OP she’s considered to be fairly adventurous and athletic.<br />
<br />
The next character I will talk about is Komari and Natsumi’s brother who seems so insignificant that I can’t even remember his name. Aside from Hotaru’s father he’s the only male character we know about in the entire town. He’s quite reserved and doesn’t even have a voice actor since he never speaks. He participates in activities with the other characters and in one episode he’s shown to be quite dextrous. Although he’s almost like a main character, because he doesn’t speak or interact much with the other characters it’s hard to remember much about him. He’s pretty much only used comedy and any scene where he isn’t just a background character he isn’t exactly treated well. For an anime with a single male character surrounded by cute girls he doesn’t seem too thrilled and for all we know he might be asexual. If we assume he isn’t he doesn’t have many options anyway. Komari and Natsumi are his sisters so they’re off limits, Renge is far too young for him, and Hotaru is a lesbian. Kaede the candy lady is only six years older than him so she could be a potential partner, but I don’t know how good of a couple they would make. Hotaru might be bisexual, but she seems a bit too obsessed with Komari to be interested in getting into a relationship with him. There was the vegetable stand that is put out by other people and we have seen busses with drivers that are most likely from that town so I don’t think the characters we have seen are the only residents, but it isn’t clear just how many other people live there or how many dating options he has if they were to keep the town going for more generations.<br />
<br />
Kaede who is also known as “the candy store lady” is a young woman who runs the local corner store that the main characters will buy candy from. She graduated from the local school and has a close connection with Renge. In addition to candy she does sell some other things in her store, but we haven’t seen too much else being sold there nor have we even seen any of the adults shopping there. It was shown that she has a kitchen attached to the store and with the way it’s set up you can tell that she actually does live there. She was first introduced as just some storekeeper, but she later became an important cast member and has gone on different outings with the other characters. It is unknown what other customers she has that aren’t the main characters.<br />
<br />
The school teacher is another important character. She is Renge’s older sister. Being only four years older than Kaede she was likely taught at the same time but we don’t know who taught the class before her. She seems like the most incompetent teacher and is often shown sleeping when she’s supposed to be teaching. I’m sure we all have had substitute teachers who do nothing but just give out worksheets for students to complete rather than actually teaching partly because the actual teacher isn’t expecting a single day of poor teaching to be that much of a detriment, but she is the main teacher and even worksheets would do a better job than her teaching style. When you think about how dysfunctional the teacher is it’s hard to overlook how the rest of the school is run. Japanese schools are cleaned by the students rather than janitors and their school doesn’t seem well taken care of. The roof leaks and the floorboards can even give way. Who knows how old the school uniforms are. They don’t look like they have much wear, but even though Hotaru is about the same size as the other girls she was never offered a uniform so it might be that they were all being used. There’s only one male student so there might be a male uniform laying around that she could wear with her own skirt, but either no one thought of that or it might be that the only reason the ones we see don’t look torn up is because they go through periodic repairs.<br />
<br />
As redundant as it may seem in an piece of writing that is intended to deconstruct my enjoyment of the series there still are a few things related to enjoyment that I haven’t gone into much depth yet. The humour in this anime is often cited as being one of its strengths. The raw enjoyment that comes from the situations and random jokes differs a fair and is actually a bit weaker than the comedy in Sansha Sanyou and Joshiraku. These two anime don’t really have anything wrong with them that would noticeably tick me off, but I still don’t consider them to be as good of anime. One thing I appreciate about Non Non Biyori is how naturally the characters grow on you. Sure, it is a common trope for a character to join a new group of people at the beginning so the introductions make sense, but unlike anime such as Code Geass and No Game No Life where even the protagonists are secretive about their true intentions the characters in this show are up front about themselves and we learn about them in a similar way to how you would learn more about your friends or coworkers in real life. I think it’s really nice and relaxing to get to know unrealistic characters in such a natural way. Anime like Anne Happy and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei introduce the characters just fine, but because all of the characters represent something different they don’t feel like real people. I know anime like Log Horizon have realistic characters in an unrealistic environment which is a good combination, but it doesn’t feel quite as good.<br />
<br />
My second point for the enjoyment section will be continuing on my comparison to Steins;Gate. Steins;Gate is well written and doesn’t have that visible of flaws, but after this analysis I understand why I didn’t like it as much as Non Non Biyori. The characters are well written and have interesting and realistic personalities, but the way they&#039;re used doesn’t leave me with the same fuzzy feeling Non Non Biyori gives me. Two of the characters die multiple times and one of the characters even changes from male to female not through a sex operation but by artificially changing their embryo to xx after it was already fertilized, something that is only possible through flawed Japanese mythology. I know I had some negative things to say about Non Non Biyori, but for a show with a magic system so well explained it disturbs me to see things that don’t work in our world and aren&#039;t explained in theirs. These specific things ticked me off in the show because of how tight the rest of the logic is. Just like the difference between cobblestone and a near-perfect sidewalk with a couple cracks the individual flaws are more noticeable and memorable in Steins;Gate than in very flawed anime like Vividred Operation, Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu., or Date a Live. The story in Steins;Gate is almost possible so the couple problems were a bit disappointing. In comparison Non Non Biyori doesn&#039;t have a story to begin with and all of its flaws fall within the realm it has set out for itself. Its simplicity is in itself a strength because it doesn&#039;t require the viewer to suspend their disbelief that much in order to get maximum enjoyment from it.<br />
<br />
The most important reasons about why I like Non Non Biyori so much more than similar anime is the way it enabled me to connect with my past nostalgia and how well it avoids balatant mistakes as well as being able to cover up its smaller existing ones. As far from reality as the characters may be they are still super cuddly and fun to be around. They really feel like they belong in their world. Although I was skeptical at first as to why I held this anime to such a high regard I still believe it’s just as good as I did when I first saw it with my brother on a plane over a year ago. I have also watched Ghost Stories (dub) with him and although I loved that anime it still wasn’t quite as good so I don’t think just watching it with him would be too big of an impact. The songs were great and the way they show all four seasons was a nice touch.<br />

    Some people spend their lives searching for tranquility or peace of the mind.<br />
Some end up never finding it, some walk right past it completely blind that it may be found in the simplest of things.<br />
<br />
Everyone is so obsessed with making their own fortune or leaving their mark on the world that they forget what the point of life is to live it at its fullest. That may  mean achieving a balance between career, the work of fulfilling yourself and relaxation, the work of being proud of what you did. Our enjoy life in a blissfull ignorance doing their daily chores or enjoying the little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125503">
        pleasures of the countryside routine. While it may not be a dashing tale of courage or ambition I have noticed that the story focuses more on creating an authentic lifestyle and not an ideal type.<br />
<br />
The overall enjoyment of the series is equally divided between all the contributing factors. As such more attention has been awarded to the artwork, attention that can be witnessed through the many breathtaking background scenes while character designs have been made to fit the story plain and simple with nothing out of the ordinary<br />
<br />
Characters have a linear evolution in the series being already formed and acting through the prism of their own personality. Being children means that their acts involve goofing around, dodging chores, having fun in any way they can.<br />
<br />
I particularly enjoyed the series because it evokes both a happy early life as well as a happy late life it is both the past and the future and it is something... to ponder on.<br />
<br />
So would you like to come fish a good time with us?.. there is plenty of room and equipment

    I haven&#039;t enjoyed a slice of life anime this much since Azumanga Daioh. This is what slice of life is all about. I&#039;m so fucking glad this thing exists. Non Non Biyori is heartwarming, funny, relaxing, and it captures the perfect feeling of beauty and nostalgia. The whole atmosphere the anime radiates is magical, and you owe it to yourself to watch it if you enjoy beauty and the simple things in life.<br />
<br />
The anime follows Hotaru Ichijou, who has just moved from Tokyo to some isolated village in the middle of nowhere. Here she meets the other four characters that are to become the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179087">
        cast, and that is where the magic begins. They all attend the same school and the same class, because there are only like five kids in the entire village (not entirely true). This already creates a cosy atmosphere, because you have a definite set of characters that you can focus on without any distractions, and they are so masterfully written that their interactions with one another becomes a pure joy to follow. Besides the main characters there are also adults that are in some way connected to them, so there are already well-established relationships and ties, but some of these you won&#039;t learn until after a few episodes. As usual with my reviews I won&#039;t go into details about the different characters, because I believe that you should experience it yourself. You will most certainly come to love them, I&#039;ll tell you that.<br />
<br />
As with all Slice of Life anime, there isn&#039;t any story present. It&#039;s all about capturing mundane everyday activities in an interesting and engaging manner, and Non Non Biyori gets full scores in this regard. The characters are all very well written, and they all contribute to the overall atmosphere and feel of the show with their own spice. The anime pays an equal amount of attention to all of them, so you&#039;re not stuck with Hotaru Ichijou only if you were worried about that, which is good because I personally find her to be the least interesting character. You get to see all the aspects of the different characters&#039; everyday life, and it really helps you connect to them. And it&#039;s so cosy! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever felt this cosy while watching another anime before. There is something about the beautiful music, art, and characters that just does something to me that most other anime fail to. At times I don&#039;t know whether I want to laugh along with the characters or tear up from the sheer beauty of the show, so I find myself doing both. If I could put it one way, I would say that Non Non Biyori conjures some sort of powerful nostalgia that you didn&#039;t know that you had, so you instantly feel at home whenever you follow the girls along with their shenanigans.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori is a wonderful show that is the embodiment of what Slice of Life is all about, so if you&#039;re looking for something fun and relaxing then I&#039;d highly recommend it. I wholeheartely believe that this anime is a great example that anime can be taken seriously as an art form. I was almost starting to lose hope, phew. If anything, this show raised the bar too high, so now I&#039;ll have an even more difficult time finding good SoLs. Curses.

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
Anime is a medium that allows us to see some crazy combinations, from legendary heroes battling over an immortal object to drills that will pierce the heavens. But other times, anime allows us to sit back, relax, and mellow out to simply enjoy the fun antics happening on-screen. In Non Non Biyori, the show does just that, leaving you with a warm feeling when all is said and done.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori sets itself up by introducing a new character in the beginning, her name being Hotaru. She just recently moved from the city to the country and has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161097">
        joined the other (only) four students at the school.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori is a slice of life anime. As such, my small premise has little merit as to what actually goes on throughout the rest of the show. When it comes to the episodic nature of an anime like this, it isn&#039;t important to really have an over-arcing plot that drives the narrative. And NNB does a great job in this regard.<br />
<br />
The majority of the actual episodes/arcs are fine for what they are. However, certain arcs stick out more so than others. Without spoiling too much, I&#039;ll talk about some of my favorite arcs and what they did so well.<br />
The first one to really grab my attention was the one featuring Ren and her same-aged neighbor friend. This arc really captures what the show does well, and that is showing off the characters doing everyday things. The arc featured little dialogue, not only because Ren and her friend are children (meaning they wouldn&#039;t have deep conversations with each other to begin with) but also because it is the way in which they interacted with one another that easily showed off how good of friends they truly were. It was incredibly simple yet very touching.<br />
<br />
Another great arc features Hotaru, Koma, and a same-aged neighbor once again. This arc I found demonstrated the comedy of the show quite nicely. It played up Koma&#039;s insecurity about being older yet more immature than her friends. It&#039;s combination of reaction faces, dead-pan humor, and adult-oriented jokes made me really enjoy this arc fully.<br />
<br />
Last one, and perhaps everyone&#039;s favorite, is the small story featuring Ren and &quot;Candy Store&quot;. This one was very sweet and made you feel extremely happy when watching it. It gave off this mother-daughter vibe between the two that I found to be so lovable. They did a nice job of making you see just how much those two care about one another, and when the arc ended, I was definitely making an audible &quot;Aww!&quot;<br />
<br />
There are more than just these three, but these are the ones that stuck out to me the most. Almost all of the arcs are at least fine in quality (whether that be comedy, &quot;feels&quot;, etc.) but you will come to find that some are just better than the others.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say here. In terms of actual animation, there isn&#039;t much to be had. What the show does well despite this is the art style and backdrops. NNB makes you truly feel as if the characters are residing in the countryside. There are wide shots with many trees and open fields. There is the lone car that passes by on the never-busy road. The characters also walk by many rice fields and animal farms. During the show, they sometimes allude to the fact that where they live is not the city, and the art of the show really helps to encapsulate this feeling.<br />
<br />
Besides the animation and art, I liked the look/design of the characters. Notably, while Hotaru and Koma are rather &quot;plain-Jane&quot; looking, Natsumi and Ren are pretty uniquely designed, at least comparatively among the other cast members.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori gives us characters that are just straight up fun.<br />
Probably the best among them is Ren. I like kids a lot, so I&#039;m a bit biased when I say I really liked her character. She&#039;s inquisitive and kind, but just smart enough to understand the many scenarios they are put in. A lot of her charm comes from the way she says certain things or how she acts like a kid her age would. She isn&#039;t one of the best child characters but she was always fun to see.<br />
<br />
Komari probably comes second character-wise. I think what I enjoyed most about her was again her child-like attitude and antics. Plus, her voice actress did a very good job. A lot of the time Komari is the butt-end of the jokes, whether this be about her height or her ineptitude at cooking. But overall, she shines best when interacting with her sister Natsumi and her good friend Hotaru.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Hotaru, she is probably the most interesting of the bunch. Besides coming from Tokyo (in the sense a &quot;foreigner&quot;), she actually is the most mature (in terms of personality and, strangely, puberty). On top of this, she has this semi-yuri crush towards Komari that is surprisingly hilarious. She is rather plain in appearance (perhaps even generic) but she interacts well with the other characters.<br />
<br />
Last but not least is Natsumi. Personifying tomboys from across the globe, she revels in lame puns, messing with her sister, and just staying optimistic in all situations. I liked her and her sister&#039;s relationship; it wasn&#039;t &quot;I&#039;m older than you&quot;, it was more &quot;we are really good friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
That probably best explains the character&#039;s interactions between each other. They are all really, really good friends.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
For me, the OP and ED were not too outstanding. The OP has this beginning part to the track (literally the first five seconds) that reminds me of underwater levels in video games. The ED is definitely very child-like with its singing and use of instruments, and fit nicely with the shows themes.<br />
<br />
I particularly found the rest of the soundtrack to be pretty good. Like the art style, it evoked feelings of the country. For many of the pieces, they would remind me of The Legend of Zelda village themes or general outdoor areas. They have a certain fantastical feel to them that I enjoyed. Furthermore, like the ED, some of them seemed like they were more &quot;playful&quot; (that is, performed with children in mind) and always put a smile on my face.<br />
<br />
In terms of the voice acting, I think everyone did an above average job in each of their performances. Special shout-outs to Natsumi, Ren, Hotaru, and Koma!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
This show definitely puts you in a good mood. It&#039;s very relaxing, with the right amount of comedy and happy feelings. It&#039;s not dramatic nor is it suspenseful. When you&#039;re watching you know you can just sit back a bit and enjoy the humorous nature of the cast.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say I absolutely loved this one, but it is for sure very enjoyable.<br />
<br />

    Important Note - Be sure to stick with this anime for at least 4-5 episodes before making your decision about the entire show. These 2 episodes are a bit dull and slightly boring but the rest is enchanting and remarkable. I won&#039;t say that these episodes are bad or anything but as compared to rest of show, a bit too normal. Don&#039;t immediately judge it even if you don&#039;t find it to your liking, give it a proper chance. This is surely not your ordinary moe-moe kyun show. Instead is sweet, lovable and rich.<br />

&quot;Nyan-pasu!&quot; <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Have you ever felt,<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this show is simply spectecular. I need

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126605">
        more people to watch it, need more people to discuss it with and just don&#039;t want it to ever end&quot;<br />
<br />
If not, then look no further because &quot;Non non Biyori&quot; is there for you. This anime is the most relaxing anime, and one of the most entertaining anime I have ever watched. Life is too short and ends too abruptly, our worries and troubles affect us more than we think they are - Why don&#039;t we make the best of time while we are still alive, shall we? <br />
<br />
In one word, I would describe this anime as a &quot;Healer&quot; as it heals all your anxiety and worries, and replaces those with a warm and happy feeling, the feeling we seem to have forgotten in our tiresome and repetitive daily routine of our respective lives. I am not gonna joke when I say this, the healing element in this show is exclusively high here. It show makes you laugh you laugh from the bottom of your heart. It doesn&#039;t overly MOE-tize anything, nor make everyone super-clumsy or astereotype. Shows of this kind are easy to mess up, as the girls are shown to be all about moe and their personality is completely forgotten. But worry not as this anime is nothing like that. Sure, it has cute girls doing cute things, but unlike a regular series, it knows what to do and when to do. You will be grinning and smiling at their cute actions, but this feeling is not temporary. You actually grow to love the characters, and this feeling can be felt in the finally episode especially. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, I am a huge slice of life genre lover, having watched countless SOL shows, loving some particular ones more, others less. When it first started, I was heavily biased towards it. I was like,&quot; It has great animation, good characters but it&#039;s a very dull and a bit boring. Meh, an average SOL.. but I guess, I will stick to it&quot;.<br />
<br />
 As you can see, my expectations had gone low. My views didn&#039;t change until I watched the 3rd episode, where it became impressively good. . From there and onwards, it didn&#039;t look back. Few episodes more and I was a fan, waiting for this anime every week in true words. It just didn&#039;t seem like the same show anymore. I am very, very glad that I continued it, and felt a bit bad for misunderstanding it at first. It is one of those &quot;Hidden gems&quot;  which tend to be slighltly ignored, somewhat of a shame.<br />
<br />
Inshort, &quot;THIS is the ride to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Story (8/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
So we have got Hotaru, a 5th grader (Yup she is, get used to it... even if some things mislead you :p) who moves on to the countryside due to her father&#039;s job transfer. At her new school, everyone is of different ages, and in different grades, ranging from 1st to 9th.  There she meets the main cast and her soon-to-be-friends - the prank lover, 7th grader Natsumi: the adorable and everyone&#039;s favorite, 1st grader Renge: and finally &#039;striving to be adult&#039; 8th grader Komari. Also there is a lazy teacher who loves sleeping more than teaching. The show begins a bit awkward, you get to know the cast and become accustomed to the relaxing air this show. In the first two episodes, nothing much happens. Once you get the hang of it, it starts feeling natural. Everything just starts to flow gradually, and you feel that the show has come alive.<br />
<br />
For people who like SOL genre but have grown tired of the repetitiveness, this show is highly recommended. It is different and more unique as it takes place in a countryside instead of your good ol&#039; city adventures. Another difference which makes this show more memorable and interesting than the rest, is the difference in age. I&#039;ve never seen a classroom, ranging from 1st grade - 9th grade all at the same time. At first it felt a bit strange, seeing a kid in the same classroom with some teenagers but as I watched more, it gradually grew on me.<br />
<br />
Beware of the yuri vibes though. Hotaru has an innocent (but lovable) on one of her senpais i.e. Komari. I am not a yuri fan, but this, I didn&#039;t mind at all. Infact, I really enjoyed it as the excitement from a sweet and pure girl like Hotaru when she gets to be around Komari, is really something to see. Even If you don&#039;t like yuri then relax, these vibes are not as strong as a proper yuri show. You can pretty much give it an okay signal as a platonic love interest, due to it being an enjoyment enhancer. I don&#039;t think that there is need for that as yuri fan or not, you will definitely enjoy it.The best thing about this show is that it doesn&#039;t try to be complex, it knows that it doesn&#039;t need to be. It is simple, sweet and lovely, just what you would expect from this genre. It has many relatable scenes, sibling quarrels are noteworthy.<br />
<br />
While not extraordinary, the story is still more special than an average one due to the countryside theme so +1 for that. <br />
<br />
Art (10/10)<br />
<br />
Now, this is the first aspect in which the anime truly shines - Art direction is pure 24 carat gold! It fully uses the potential of the setting to it&#039;s peak. Expect some mouthwatering scenery, the detailed animatio and the beautiful countryside. The mountains, The ponds, The farms, The trees, The flowers. Everything is colorful, vibrant and simply delicious, you just want to grab your screen and eat the gorgeous animation away. I have never had the urge to watch an anime in HD as much as I did for Non non Biyori, and so I did. I watched every episode in HD and had lots of fun admiring the magnificient sight.<br />
<br />
 More than anything, this show is consistent. The quality does not drop an inch from start to finish. You can see the passion, it&#039;s like the director didn&#039;t slouch for a second, nor was careless. The attention and effort being put into it is admirable. There are some still images too. Normally, those would turn the people off. Who wants a show with screens frozen for what-seems-like-eternity, but this shows is the proof that if used well, even still images can help portray the emotions of the characters well. <br />
<br />
I must say I am very much impressed with the art director. If he could do this well with a small-medium budget then what would happen if it had a high budget? Just the though is endearing So kudos to the the studio for providing us with such richfullness, colorfulness and gorgeousness. 10/10, can&#039;t cut any marks from here, it is one of the strongest points of this show. <br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
<br />
Even in sound aspect, this anime doesn&#039;t lose its shine. The sound track consists of some soothing and relaxing pieces which puts your mind to ease. The sound of cicadas, the running water, the rustling water. Ah, the feels. It takes you back to countryside and you feel like running through the lush-green grass, open your arms wide and feel the wind. <br />
<br />
The voice actors have done their job very well. I am just in love with Renge&#039;s voice, she has a very cute and fitting voice upon listening which, you put on a smile. The way she talks is really adorable. Who can forget the trademark line of this show i.e. &quot;Nyanpasu!&quot; - She is the inventor(just shows how creative she actually is) Same goes for everyone: The mischevious voice of Natsumi really suits her image, Komari&#039;s childish voice goes well with her personality, Hotaru&#039;s voice has a certain depth to her which suits her outer mature appearance. Likewise, for everyone.The opening and ending tracks are appropriate for this show as they are relaxing to hear and not a mind stress.The endingsong starts a bit lousy, but it is done on purpose to fit the lazy theme of the show. It becomes quite catchy in the mid all the <br />
<br />
way to end.<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10)<br />
<br />
Characters huh.<br />
<br />
Actually I wasn&#039;t accepting anything from the characters when I first started the show. I expected regular stereotypes, but man, how wrong I was. Instead, I got some lively characters who are memorable and believable. Character attachment aspect is surprisingly high and you can&#039;t help but have atleast one or two favorites. Usually, there are one or two characters whom you just don&#039;t like, but in this anime - none. The writer knows how to make his/her character interesting without overdramatizing anything, and that&#039;s what makes them great. The bonds between everyone here feels realy, sweet and enlights a warm feeling inside you. <br />
<br />
We have Natsumi who is ultra-mischevious and somewhat tomboyish. She loves teasing others and having fun. Her elder sister, Komari-chan is the most often victim of her misbehaviors. She is not good at studies, doesn&#039;t mean she can&#039;do it. She just... doesn&#039;t study. Also her mother is fearsome whenever she does something bad. Those moments are very funny and you feel like relating to her. There is always a scary mothers<br />
<br />
Renge-chan is the kiddo of the group, but she is no ordinary kiddo! She is inspirational, interesting and a hinted-to-be-genius. She loves to draw and is a quite talented artist . Inventing new words, and making unique jokes are her hobby. She is one of the most unique characters, not only in appearance but also in personality. There is something extraordinary about her which makes her shine.<br />
<br />
Komari is a height complex and is constantly striving to be mature and cool, but things just don&#039;t go well for her. She is the older sister of Natsumi, but looks younger, something which puts pouts on her mouth. But that doesn&#039;t mean she is gonna give up any sooner, she will try again and again, no matter how circumstances lead, and that&#039;s what I love how about her. She is the &#039;good kid&#039; of the family and the one who doesn&#039;t want to get in other people&#039;s way. Easily scared, has flaws but who doesn&#039;t? She is cute and sweet.<br />
<br />
Hotaru is, arguably, the main character of the show. She is a bit too tall for her age and is mature - Total opposite of Komari who is clumsy and immature but this doesn&#039;t stop her from loving her kawaii senpai. She loves spending time with Komari, be it cooking, shopping, sleeping in the same bed (kotatsu to be exact) or just sitting around. What I love about her is, even if she has a unusual fondness for Komari, she doesn&#039;t ignore others. She talks with everyone and have fun with everyone, it&#039;s just that Komari holds a bit more special existence to her.<br />
<br />
Also we have Kaede aka &quot;candy shop&quot; by Renge and her friends (believe me - that&#039;s how they call her) She is a very cool onee-san and shares a sweet bond with Ren which is something you got to watch. Suguru who is the emotionless and a good-at-anything kind of brother of Komari and Natsumi. He is 9th grader and the most interesting thing about him is that he doesn&#039;t speak much. love how this series becomes a &quot;spot the onii-san&quot; as he rarely appears, but when he does - be prepared as the hilarity ensues. There are some other minor characters as well, all of which are nice and interesting but sadly, don&#039;t get enough screentime.<br />
<br />
The fun thing is that you not only laugh with your characters, but also feel angry and sad with them. It&#039;s like you can feel their emotions and feel a part of yourself inside them. It isn&#039;t an easy task to do, it takes guts and skill to be able to make the audience feel &#039;one&#039; with its characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Non non Biyori&quot; and &quot;Enjoyment&quot; can be described as alternatives of each other, as it doesn&#039;t have a single moment which you are not enjoying. It does everything more than good, and doesn&#039;t lose sight of its objective - Be a relaxing series.<br />
<br />
I laughed. I didn&#039;t cry (Why would I, when it is just so focused on making me grin like a silly kid?) I waited for it every week, and when it ended, I missed it continuously for atleast a week. I still do... When it first started, I had high expectations but I had reduced them after watching the first episode. As it went on and on and as I got immersed into the series, it grew on me to the point that I began to count days for it&#039;s next episode. It has the &#039;X&#039; factor to it which makes it one of the most memorable series of the year. It is a hope that there are still good, honest shows out there.<br />
<br />
Watch this show and be relax, and relaxed and relaxed. It is a powerful spell which heals everything like one of those cure spell in rpg games. It will soothe your mind, and calm you down even when you are having some major worries going on. Another plus point is that it is highly rewatchable with some excellent quality art, delightful characters and gentle music. I highly recommend it to those who are too tired of the real life and need a break. This will be your breaking point, and a point to reminisce.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s &quot;Nyanpasu-ing desu&quot; (bad pun)

    If there were a competition about what is the most peaceful anime ever ? Surely the 2013 anime of studio Silver Link, Non non Biyori, would come out on the very top.<br />
<br />
So you are tired after a long day working/studying? You feel bad after watching a top drama or you get a headache after watching mindfucking show? Just watch Non non biyori, its the chicken soup for the soul. It will warm your heart and cure your soul.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in the countryside village of Asahigaoka, a place lacking the many of the conveniences that people from the city are accustomed to. The nearest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193989">
        stores are miles away and the school consists of only five students, each of whom is in a different grade of elementary or middle school. Hotaru Ichijo, a fifth grader from Tokyo, transfers into Asahigaoka Branch School and has to adjust to countryside life with her new friends.<br />
<br />
If i were a child again, i would want the exact same life in this anime. It is restful, joyful and vital. Every characters are so nice but everyone has their own problems and that make it close to realistic.<br />
<br />
Silver Link has done a wonderful job to the animation of this show. Everything is bright, colorful. It&#039;s like a lifeful painting. The characters are well drawn, detailed. The soundtrack are simply amazing. It fit the show perfectly.<br />
<br />
For slice of life fan, this one has my highest recommendation. A show that cant be passed.<br />

Non Non Biyori (lit. Non Non Weather), <br />
is a slice of life and a comedy anime that I would easily recommend to both young and older viewers. From the very first episode on to the end of season two, viewer’s interest remains captivated and soothed through the portrayal of pristine environments, thoroughly enjoyable and quirky adventures of its characters, and a calming soundtrack. There is much charm to the serene and slowly paced storyline, which is dynamically complemented by the incremented character development of a whimsical cast. Thus, if you wish to relax, laugh, and enjoy life; I couldn’t recommend this anime enough.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173687">
        is fitting of the (SOL) genre, and has high rewatch value. Twenty minute-long episodes are segmented such that each new day in the countryside village of Asahigaoka is presented along with its quirky laughs, disputes and unique adventures.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Much attention and care has been invested into the artwork. This is witnessed through the impressive background scenery. As examples, viewers are presented with a view of rocks within a stream of running water, the gentle sway amongst fields of grass in the wind, as well as a buzzing reminder as to surrounding insect life. The smooth and perfect visual integration of movement or processes within nature such as these, all serve to bring the scenes and its interrelated components towards a nearer degree of reality.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
The songs utilized for the opening (by nano.RIPE) and ending (by ZAQ), are fitting to the anime’s theme and exceptional recordings that are well worth checking out. The original soundtrack is even more impressive, where the composer Hiromi Mizutani strikes dissonant notes at seemingly perfect times, dualistically capturing the essence of nature and its fragility through the simple and off key sounding of a child’s recorder (aka Renchon’s melody). Also too, I now acknowledge the excellent use of silence in many situations within this anime; I can ascertain that it has served as most effective in enhancing viewer’s (such as myself) emotional perceptibility and relatedness towards the characters during concurrent situations.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
The cast is rather simplistic, but individually they are also quirky and unique; each in their own ways. This is further conducive towards enabling many comedic moments all throughout the anime. In addition, a case can be made in regards to the prevalence of a shōjo atmosphere, this is because almost all characters are female, and the few males are rendered insignificant to the point that it is funny. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
As the story revolves around charming, and adorable girls, this means that inciting incidents mainly involve goofing around, dodging chores, and having fun in any which way possible. Then, from this I conclude that the degree of enjoyment derived from this anime lies in the beholder; in other words, that it depend’s on viewer’s preference or their appreciation for simplistic themes such as innocence and play.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
Thank you for reading,<br />
I hope you enjoy~<br />

    Series like these are the reason I like writing reviews. Forget complex plotlines and settings. Deep character backgrounds and drama. Romance and fanservice. Be prepared for some adventures in the countryside with some of the most loveable cast of characters you could find in a slice of life series.<br />
<br />
The fall season came and things got cold. But thankfully enough there are heartwarming series like these being produced to keep your spirits high up and a smile on your face at any time of the day. Non Non Biyori is a slice of life in the purest sense of the term, using simple characters and a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123199">
        simple setting with clever scripting to bring out the best that the slice of life genre has to offer.<br />
<br />
Everything starts when the transfer student Hotaru moves into the countryside to join the small elementary school there only to find out that there&#039;s literally 5 students in total and one single teacher in the entire facility. And to top it off all of them are in different grades. Big changes are going to happen in Hotaru&#039;s life as she goes from being in a city environment to a country side one. Developing friendships with all the students in her classroom and discovering all the fun things you have in the country that you couldn&#039;t get in a big city like Tokyo.<br />
<br />
The anime follows an episodical format as per usual in these kinds of series. With each episode focusing on one or two little stories that involve some or all of the main girls. The main focus is soft gag comedy, no exaggeration or over the top innuendos, just simple comedy with a nice touch of slapstick humor thrown in there at times to make you chuckle once in a while. Everything is done smoothly and without overcomplications, allowing more effort to be put into the actual entertaining aspect of the comedy while also keeping you relaxed. You certainly won&#039;t have to scratch your head while watching this show.<br />
<br />
And then we have what I believe to be the greatest asset Non Non Biyori has. The characters. 5 girls all from different ages, each with their own quirky personality and traits that offer the viewer a vast range of prespectives as opposed to having a character set with people in the same grade. First we have Hotaru, a fifth grade student that came from the city. Not used to the country lifestyle Hotaru will try and learn everything she can to enjoy her new life in the countryside while enjoying her life as a student and of course having her characteristic obsession with her senior Komari. We then have the Koshigaya sisters. Natsumi being the more outgoing and loud type of character who is always trying to cause trouble, and Komari, the senior that tries to show her authority but fails miserably due to her small stature. And last but not least, perhaps a fan favorite, there is Renge a first grader with the habit to do whatever she wants and try to learn from everyone at the same time in her own cute little way. Watching all these different aged characters form bonds and do a lot of activities together is what Non Non Biyori is all about and the thing that will not disappoint.<br />
<br />
But not only are the main characters strong, the side characters are al very original and have indivituality and traits that make you remember them as well. This is something plenty of series lack where they just ditch a side character after they appear for one or two episodes. There&#039;s the local candy store owner, nickname Candy Store. There&#039;s the school&#039;s teacher that&#039;s more of a slacker than anything else. And one of my personal favorites the last of the Koshigaya siblings Suguru who by not uttering a single word can be one of the most entertaining. These small aspect are in fact a big deal in these kind of series and I&#039;m so glad they were not left out.<br />
<br />
Another aspect that&#039;s worth mentioning is the art. I can not stress out how many beautiful sceneries there are in this show. Every single episodes seems to use new backgrounds for a wide panoply of colors and feelings. You as the viewer will be transported into the countryside with all the bright colors and amazing landscapes which, as simple as they are, have their charm and make this show much more simple and light hearted as opposed to typical high school settings in a crowded city. <br />
<br />
Nanairo Biyori, the opening theme for the show is great to set the mood. Whenever I watch an episode I always listen carefully to the opening theme and watch the senquence, I know instantly that what&#039;s coming up will put a smile on my face. And then the ending theme Non Non Biyori which seems more like a song you&#039;d put on in order to fall asleep bids you farewell still in a relaxing manner. The overall sounds during the show are not overused or repetitive. Aside from the typical cicadas and the sun glowing as the wind waves the grass around everything feels like a proper life in the country where there&#039;s no excessive ruckus.<br />
<br />
I could fanboy a lot about this show but I think you should take a look for yourself. My enjoyment of this series is sky high. I watch it often at night after getting all worked up during the day and no matter what happens I know this will bring a smile to my face and make me forget my worries. This is slice of life for everyone to enjoy with its minimalistic yet effective attitude.<br />
<br />
Overall Non Non Biyori is this 2013 fall&#039;s slice of life gem. Simple and relaxing. Great cast with quirky but effective humor. A lot of individuality from each character, never leaving out side characters and yet always adding something new to the mixture. These 5 elementary and middle school girls will keep you cheering for them as they go through both hardships and cheerful moments together. If you are a slice of life fan for its simplicity. Non Non Biyori is a show that should not be dismissed as it offers great potential and I am thankful that anime like these are produced to date.

    Every once in a while, you come across a show that seems very plain, boring, and not worth the time. You read the synopsis and it still doesn&#039;t draw you in. However, you give it a shot. Non Non Biyori was a show that fit this description on the surface, but taking the chance on it was well worth it. In fact, its simplicity was the major strength of the show and Non Non Biyori was by far my favorite show of the season.<br />
<br />
The story itself is rather basic, as are most slice of life shows. It follows a group of four young ladies (aged

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126211">
        7, 10, 13, and 14 approximately) and their lives in the Japanese countryside. Away from the life in the big city of Tokyo, Hotaru Ichijo (age 10) must adapt to a more simpler way of life and assimilate into the community. The episode titles are quite vague and the series follows a more episodic sequence complete with shorts within an episode. Even as it jumps along, the story is easy to understand, and more importantly, to enjoy.<br />
<br />
My favorite part of Non Non Biyori is the art style. Being set in the Japanese countryside, a lot of detail rests within the landscape. The background settings are lush with vibrant greens, blues, and pinks. It&#039;s a beautiful setting. Within this setting are homes with a dull brown colors (aside from Hotaru&#039;s higher end home which is a nice white with colored accents). The school is a run-down shack that is made completely of wood. The character designs are succinct and well executed. The colors of Komari and Natsumi Koshigaya&#039;s school uniforms are a very bland scheme of tan and dark blue. The very colorful backgrounds couple with the dull houses and clothing creates a very stark color contrast which is easy on the eyes. The show is beautiful and pleasing to look at. Viewers receive an added bonus during the end cards where a photo of the real-life Japanese countryside are shown. It is a part of Japan life and culture not commonly conveyed in anime.<br />
<br />
The music, sound effects, and voice cast is also well done. Right from the get-go you get a reoccurring OST along with Renge Miyauchi (age 7) providing an off tune accompaniment on recorder. It&#039;s a rather basic melody and sets the tone for the entire show. The openings and endings have a playful feel. The background effects provide a comforting feel. They display a serene and peaceful environment that is very different than shows set in the city or in large schools. Where I am most impressed is the ability of grown adult women being able to provide voices to children and do it effectively. Renge&#039;s voice is the most impressive. Being 7 years old, her voice actor is able to capture a very juvenile tone. The show loses points for not having Nii-chan, Sugaru Koshigaya, speak once (just kidding).<br />
<br />
The characters are well done and they all have very distinguishable traits. Starting from the oldest, Komari Koshigaya is a 14 year old girl who is just starting to enter womanhood. However, she is very short and has stunted development which causes her grief. Natsumi Koshigaya is a 13 year old girl who is Komari&#039;s little sister. However, she is already taller than her sister which irritates Komari. She is tomboyish and athletic, but not very good at school and is always getting into trouble. Hotaru Ichijo is the main protagonist and is a 10 year old transfer from Tokyo. She is rather wealthy and is well developed for someone her age. She looks up to Komari, her senpai, and admires her in an almost obsessive way. Renge Miyauchi is an eccentric 7 year old who has an understandably childish outlook. She provides a lot of the show&#039;s comedy with her mannerisms and preferences. Despite her age, she melds well with the older girls. The supporting cast provides a nice community effect and rounds out the show in a nice way.<br />
<br />
What sets this show apart from other shows is its simplicity. It&#039;s easy to follow because there is no complex plot or unanswered questions. What you see is what you get, which is extremely refreshing. There is a warm friendship among the four main characters that is very uplifting. As an adult male, I was not sure how I would relate to a show focused on elementary and middle school girls, but the show resonated with me because their daily lives were so realistic that it draws you into the show. Where this show fails, is it&#039;s tendency to drift into the mainstream anime scene, most notably the unnecessary fan-service. I feel like that has no place in this show, especially with a group of characters aged so young. Even so, what little fan-service was present in this show did not detract from the enjoyment of Non Non Biyori. I highly recommend it as a departure from the norm that exists in today&#039;s anime.

    Non Non Biyori is a work of art.<br />
<br />
Everything is so well done, the soundtrack is so soothing and calm, the background art is gorgeous, and all the characters are very likeable, original and most importantly very varied. I&#039;d be lying if I said this anime didn&#039;t make me feel warm and happy inside, because that&#039;s exactly what it did. The whole setting is very nostalgic, there isn&#039;t a whole lot of story if that&#039;s what your into, though the creators do make an effort to keep it interesting.<br />
It&#039;s definitely worth the watch, I&#039;m hoping I can say the same about the second season as well.
