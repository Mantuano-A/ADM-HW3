Story<br />
The story is about Takeo Gouda, a first-year high school student whose life up until now has been full of bromance. Despite being unpopular with girls, Takeo has always been fully respected by most of the male characters in the series. They acknowledge him as the best person. They even idolize him. While, on the other hand, Takeo&#039;s best friend, Suna, is undoubtedly your typical popular boy with girls. All of the female characters, regardless of age, will always fall in love with our lovely Suna. That includes, but is not limited

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199378">
        to, mothers, high school girls, kindergarten kids, and even milfs. However, Suna is far from being bad. And I&#039;d say he is the best wingman we could ever hope for! As they both lean and complete each other with their different personalities. Thus, we will follow the daily antics of their lives, which are filled with neverending sweet-happy moments. As there is always an up and down in one&#039;s life, the series succeeds in portraying the difficult reality of being a teenager in love. In all honesty, the precious moments in this series are so overwhelming that you can never regret the choice of getting yourself into it. And now, the story starts to lift its veil into an interesting scene in which Rinko Yamato is being molested inside the train. Now, what will our main character do?<br />
<br />
Oh, God! Takeo God mode is activated, everyone! Run for your life!<br />
<br />
Crawl if you need to! Scream if you want to! It’s solely to save your life!<br />
<br />
Thus, thanks to the molester&#039;s sacrifice, we can see a glimpse of what the God of Rage might look like. What a sacred moment to experience. It is quite funny though, *chuckles. <br />
<br />
Poor molester... This hilarious moment turns into a heart-wrenching moment simply because of that molester. I truly hope that he is never seen or heard again... Let’s all just assume that he is dead. That’s even better. Now, let’s all say &quot;Owaaaa&quot; as a parting gift to him. Owaaaa!<br />
<br />
Art and Animation<br />
I’ll admit, the art of the characters can be a little weird. Even when I&#039;ve watched through half of the series, it’s still weird. I mean, those eye lashers are kind of hard to ignore after all. However, it has also become one of the most refreshing scenes to see. The idea is kinda new and I doubt you&#039;ve seen one like this before, so it’s a lovely scene to see once in a while. The animation is certainly not a masterpiece level, but definitely a top tier. I’ve got to say, I&#039;m glad its animation is not some well-made cheap animation because it could ruin the whole potential of Ore Monogatari! <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Op and Ed are bringing up such a pleasant atmosphere. It’s obvious that the Op is lovely and slowly capturing all of the beholder&#039;s attention. It was so freaking sweet, that you simply could not help but glue your eyes to the lovely theme of the series. Perhaps, vanilla and cream could be more unique than you may think.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
One of the interesting aspects to be seen in this series is the very uniqueness of every single character that it has. They are not simply your typical characters that exist just for the plot. They are there to move along with the story using their unique traits and make the relationship seem as natural as possible. The love rivals, neither friends nor parents, all have fun and enjoyable characteristics that are fun to see. They manage to stand out in their own class without following any other character stereotypes that we’ve ever seen. Clearly, the concept of generic and typical has been thrown out. As the pace slowly builds up, before we even know it, the relationship between all of them is already too beautiful to have. Our effort as we waited patiently to see how this series would go has really paid off. All that matters is that we will also cherish all those happy moments together with every character. They can make us feel excited on most occasions, sometimes a bit sad that you can even shed tears, but there&#039;s still a happy ending that awaits us in the end. In a moment, we can also know that Takeo is seriously slow when it’s about love and feelings, but he is not your typical dense type of character where he doesn&#039;t do anything at all. &quot;I will never understand it if you don’t tell me&quot;-Takeo. Hearing those words, we know that he is quite powerless no matter how strong he can be physically and mentally, but at the very least he tries to understand what the problem is and the difficulties that come along with it. He always loved to sacrifice himself, even going as far as to find even a little bit of happiness for his friends and family. Even if it means that he is the one who will eventually get hurt in the end. Takeo is not a heartless badass, warrior, nor a hero. He is just the type of person who will treasure what’s most important to him. And that’s more than enough. And in the end, Takeo earns every right to achieve his happiness.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
&quot;Sometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not from what they say. But simply just being who they are&quot;.<br />
<br />
This quote is amazingly suited to portraying the whole series. It’s such a beautiful love story in a sense. Rather than mere sweet and sad moments together, they created an inspiring love that bloomed within people&#039;s hearts. They don’t try to make the series melodramatic, rather, they just let us freely explore all of the characters until we all come to love them. In a sense, it’s more than meets the eyes. On behalf of my honest opinion, I must say I’ve had a fun ride watching the series until the very end. Because love simply can not be described as either words or actions, but more, it’s the pure feeling of two hearts. As it was tied up by a mysterious red string, all of the characters, story, and pace were bound up all together into hilarious yet lovely moments.

    There&#039;s a lot of innocence that comes with the experience of a first love, especially that which is between teenagers. Despite knowing next to nothing about the world, you&#039;re often head over heels for one another, bouncing around any idealistic hopes or plans for the future in the process. It&#039;s both adorable and sickening, and for its first few episodes, Ore Monogatari does a great job capturing that confusing mix of feelings. Then it tries to be a little bit more than that. <br />
<br />
The most common praise of the show seems to be that isn&#039;t your typical shoujo, but I disagree—it kicks off as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195266">
        protagonist, Takeo, saves a certain Yamato from being groped on the train, and then begins to follow his relationship with her. It&#039;s the modern equivalent of a prince on a white horse saving a helpless girl from a bunch of baddies, except the prince is over six feet tall and not conventionally attractive. Rounding out the two is Sunakawa, a childhood friend who reluctantly takes on the bishounen role. You can practically see the jokes coming, but that&#039;s alright; the trio has such nice chemistry together that it&#039;s easy to forget how horribly cliché it is, and amidst the initial focus on heartwarming cuteness, it manages to paint each and every frame with an endearing stroke. <br />
<br />
The best option would have been to continue down that humble path, as when it comes to reoccurring drama, thin characters don&#039;t hold up. And then it starts introducing even more to fill out its subplots. Need to shift the story to jealousy?  Don&#039;t worry, add a new character! No way out of the situation you&#039;re in? Oh, feel free to throw a relevant one in! Attempts are thankfully made to flesh these side characters out, but after happening a few times in a row, it gets tiring. The show is not concerned about Takeo and Yamato&#039;s relationship, but only the events that happen during it. There&#039;s even a few jokes about the lack of any relationship progression, but knowing the mangaka is aware of that vital flaw is far more frustrating than funny.  <br />
<br />
The result of this mess is that you&#039;re left with more questions each episode. Will Takeo and Yamato ever advance beyond the stage of handholding and throwing around &quot;I love you&quot; like it&#039;s going out of style? How are the two managing to stick together in their current state? Who is Sunakawa as a character, and why do we know next to nothing about him? I&#039;d hope at least one of these is answered by the end of its run, but it&#039;s hard to have expectations of something so stubborn. I have to wonder if it was written with romance in mind, since it works even better as a mystery. <br />
<br />
Combined with an ever-declining animation quality and audio so unobtrusive it seems silent,  Ore Monogatari is more of a weekly chore than it is entertainment. You wouldn&#039;t be wrong to call it &quot;Nisekoi without the harem&quot; (probably why the crossover manga between the two exists), which basically alludes to &quot;nothing&quot;. It&#039;s surprisingly hard to criticize for paragraph upon paragraph without venturing into simple complaints, since the lack of progression doesn&#039;t give much material to write about. So while the anime does showcase the directorial prowess of Morio Asaka, visual gags and all, it isn&#039;t enough to save the aimless property from the clutches of mediocrity.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re much better off watching Chihayafuru, which displays the talent of roughly the same staff far more accurately.

    I watched Ore Monogatari after seeing lots of good reviews about it. Especially because they said that it&#039;s &quot;really good&quot; and &quot;unique&quot;, but watching this anime made me VERY disappointed.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
I would&#039;ve given it a higher score if it wasn&#039;t a 24 episodes anime. Why? Because this anime is mostly about &quot;nothing&quot;. Lots of people said that it&#039;s unique but I don&#039;t see anything unique about it. It started off like this: Guy saves the girl, they started to meet a lot.<br />
<br />
So the rest of the series went on like this: Meet (there are flowers and bubbles every time they meet), lovey-dovey, meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet-lovey-dovey,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207808">
        petty problem. Imagine 21 episodes of nothing but the same things over and over again.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art is the only thing that I like in this anime because it&#039;s so pretty.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
The opening and ending songs are not that really interesting for me, so I often skip them. The were also lots of times where a scene became even more boring because of the background music that&#039;s playing.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
Takeo - There are lots of anime where the male lead is not handsome so Takeo is not the &quot;first&quot;. The only difference  is that, he is &quot;obviously&quot; very ugly and bigger compared to most of the characters. They said that, &quot;even though he is ugly at least he is kind&quot;. But then in this anime, Takeo is not the only kind person. Almost everyone is kind. Even that handsome Suna is kind. So, what makes Takeo great compared to them?<br />
<br />
Yamato - is the usual shoujo female lead. Cute,Tiny ( TOO tiny for Takeo which really bothers me a lot), she looks fragile but at least she knew how to make a move on the guy that she like without making herself looks like a flirt. There is nothing interesting about her, some female characters are even more interesting than her.<br />
<br />
Sunakawa- The complete opposite of Takeo. He is handsome and popular, but even though he is handsome he didn&#039;t act like a bad person. I admire his character a lot. He is such a good friend. But then, I thought that there will be something more to him. Something to look forward to, but none of that happened since this anime focused on Takeo and Yamato&#039;s relationship.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
I almost want to dropped it after 7 episodes.  Because that 7 episodes almost bored me to death, but I have a policy not to drop any anime so I had to bear with it. It would&#039;ve been okay if it&#039;s only 12 episodes.

    Alot of people seem to bash this series for a number of invalid reasons, mainly because they expect things that the show never promised to provide. In order to cookie cut it for the people that don&#039;t have the brain capacity to read the genres of the series i will now list them personally for you:<br />
<br />
When you watch this series you can expect:<br />
<br />
THIS:<br />
1. Romance<br />
2. Comedy<br />
3. Shoujo.... yep oh wait? girls? das right people, this series demographics are not aimed to make your wittle willy hard.<br />
<br />
NOT THIS:<br />
1. Drama<br />
2. Boobs<br />
3. Action of ANY kind.<br />
4. Fantasy of ANY kind.<br />
5. Slice of Life (yep its not a slice of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199454">
        life and is therefore not bound by any of that genres characteristics)<br />
6. School (same as slive of life)<br />
7. Practically anything that isen&#039;t Comedic or Romantic.<br />
<br />
Now that is a very broad spectrum, but how can any sane individual criticise ANYTHING for something they we&#039;re NOT promised? I mean, yep i would be kinda pissed if wateched the new Star Wars movie and it didn&#039;t contain dope ass lightsaber fights, but i would&#039;nt criticize it for not including a romance or gollum from LOTR (hint: because that was never promised to begin with).<br />
<br />
So, all this aside... it&#039;s pretty good, made me feel good and made me laugh.<br />
<br />
It can be lacking in plot and at times is a little slow, but i&#039;m a dude so what do i know, there could be a ton of &quot;hints&quot; in there that i didn&#039;t catch... like i never do with the ladies but whatevs.<br />
<br />
I give it a 9, because it was great, although still far from a masterpiece.

    Ore Monogatari!!, also known as My Love Story, is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a story about love between two main characters – Takeo and Yamato. And at first glance, they look like a mismatch. It doesn’t take a genius to realize as the two looks nothing alike. Takeo looks like a professional sumo wrestler standing nearly 7 feet tall while Yamato has the appearance of a frail schoolgirl. However, the story is more than just about appearances. Because in this love story, destiny connects them in ways that really gives the word ‘love’ its important meaning.<br />
<br />
Written and crafted by Kazune Kawahara, the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199332">
        is what I consider a classic for the rom-com genre. An interesting catch though is that there isn’t a love triangle between two main guys fighting for a girl. In fact, we have Sunakawa Makoto, a very popular guy who seems to attract almost any girl. The catch is that he is more like the antithesis of a playboy. He doesn’t have any interest in getting a girlfriend but actually devotes his time to help his friend Takeo experience love. Get the general picture? It sets up the primary story that connects Takeo with other characters instead of a drama clingy series. And throughout the way, he becomes part of a love story that changes his life forever.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes easily establishes a lot of facts about the main characters. Takeo has the outer appearance of someone that would make almost any girl frighten in fear. However, he is a guy with a heart of gold. His action speaks louder than words as he is dedicated to help others; friends, family, or even strangers. Then, there’s Yamato, a sweet innocent girl who falls for Takeo at first sight after he saves her on the train from an apparent pervert. The series approaches this concept with careful planning as the first episodes builds on the chemistry between the two. Makoto supports them from behind the lines while offering helpful advice. What I find interesting about the initial setup is how Takeo will learn about love. Clearly, he lacks experience when it comes to relationships. These include going on dates, setting up the right moments, or initiating a first kiss. His outer appearance also doesn’t help the fact that he is often misjudged. Yet, the show does a very clever job with fleshing out the characters. Through flashbacks and characterization, we see how Takeo’s personality really is like when he was little. The show also can be persuasive when it comes to letting the audience know why others changes their view on Takeo as the story progresses. A crystal clear way of presenting the story is something that isn’t done so easily with directing but for Ore Monogatari, it knows its ways.<br />
<br />
As relationship dynamics is a primary focus in the show, it’s also risky when the story already sets up the main characters as the couple. No, forget set up. How about just bringing them together in union? While the pacing seems a bit abrupt at first, I can honestly say that the show does an appealing job to show their progress as a couple. This is because other characters are introduced to bring out the best of them together. For instance, there’s Ai, Makoto older sister. While she may seem like a love rival at first, the show quickly makes it clear that the only eyes Takeo has for is Yamato. It shows that he is loyal with his commitments and often tries to prove himself as a worthy boyfriend. Many times throughout the show, Takeo appeals to others (including Ai) for advice. These include reading girls magazines, learning to cook, and even trying to very comically to practice kissing with a friend. We also get a good idea that Takeo wants to be with Yamato both physically and emotionally. As he lacks experience in love, the show inspires ways for Takeo to become better person. This is connected by the relationship Takeo shares with Yamato, Makoto, Ai, and more characters later on. <br />
<br />
As sweet as the show can be, one might question about the pacing of the series. How does Ore Monogatari formulate into a 2 cour series about a couple that becomes official at so early in the stage? I had some doubts at first about this and it can be understandable if some people feels that the show can be repetitive. Almost every episode feels similar as it focuses on Takeo and Yamato. Hardly any other character becomes the main focus although they do have some roles, whether major or minor. It can also be frustrating sometimes to see how dense Takeo is when taking the initiative that involves what couples should be doing (ex. Holding hands, kissing, etc). In essence, a show like this often puts the couple ahead of others but it isn’t entirely shy to give some supporting characters their own spotlights. Characters such as Saijou and Nanako gets their own exclusive episode while Ai also her spotlight moments with Takeo. In essence, it’ll take patience to watch the show. Luckily, there’s comedy that factors into entertainment. Rather than relying on dirty fan service or shock value, the show has a charming presence of delivering humor. The main part of it comes from the couple of Takeo and Yamato as they show human expressions that you would typically see in any rom-com. Then, there’s also Takeo as he accomplishes nearly inhuman feats because of his impressive physique. Similarly, Makoto and Takeo’s relationship can also get quite comedic because of the latter’s occasional lack in common sense. If you want comedy, then there’s a performance that will get you smiling.<br />
<br />
Madhouse adapts the manga with its production and to be quite honest, it’s gorgeous. The color palette like background and character designs illustrates the classic feel of what a rom-com shoujo should be. Character designer Hamada Kunihiko (Nana, Chihayafuru) puts emphasis on the characters’ youthful looks to give them their appeal. Of course, Takeo stands out as the most prominent figure in the show. He is designed to look like a professional sumo wrestler who stands out taller and more ripped than anyone in the show. Yamato has the innocent look of a flower while the Sunakawa siblings are designed to look like beauties. It creates a surge of diversity with the main cast that people can feel attached to. And speaking of diversity, the show also ventures to other settings besides school such as the outdoor woods and beach. Lastly, the show’s fan service isn’t relied on showing skin despite having the classic beach episode. Instead, it further progresses the relationship between Takeo and Yamato. From a humorous perspective, the character reactions is what really brings out the entertainment values that fans may crave for.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is fairly decorative although not outstanding. The OST and OP theme songs are neat for their ability to portray the style of the show. But what may stands out more is the character voice mannerisms. Takeo’s voice sounds like he is a lot older than he appears to be while Yamato is the opposite. She has a soft voice that really shows her innocence. The Sunakawa siblings both have a more mature voice in particular Ai as she is portrayed as the older sister type. So what does this mean? It basically shows that the characters are realistic to their appearance and roles. <br />
No, I wouldn’t say Ore Monogatari is a show that will be bucketing tears. There’s no tragic moments that makes the audience feel like there’s a need to cry. Instead, we get a classic shoujo rom-com with affectionate character relationships. Even the love triangles that occasionally appears in the show doesn’t go into a direction that gets distracting. And while the pacing will feel a bit repetitive, it’s also important to realize the objective of Ore Monogatari!!: to tell a love story with charm, elegance, realism, and developing youth. And that is a certain kind of beautiful.

    It&#039;s very easy for me to be swept away by certain animes/tv shows/ books, but watching this one took me to an entire new level. I can honestly say it was/is my favourite anime.<br />
<br />
I love every single one of Takeo&#039;s expressions, the way he&#039;s pretty dense as well. I love how he genuinely values the people he is surrounded by and only wants the best for each of them. Suna&#039;s laugh makes me smile and watching him reminisce and see how much he values his friendship with Takeo is so heart warming. I adore Yamato and how much she adores Takeo. Watching her initially overcome

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200713">
        little things like asking him out and holding his hand and kissing him is so cute to watch.

    Spoilers will exist.<br />

Story: 2<br />
The first few episodes were really good because it was something different (from what I&#039;ve seen). An unpopular guy amongst girls, who&#039;s not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl&#039;s feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins...<br />
Or so I had hoped.<br />
<br />
I should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199386">
        each other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on. So the focus then shifts to other people and their relationships but it&#039;s executed quite boringly. When the focus is back onto their relationship you can always expect Takeo to misunderstand, overreact or &quot;SUKI DA&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
It felt a bit like it was a children&#039;s anime in that the backgrounds were just very bright, watercoloured and simple. The girls were drawn quite oddly and I wasn&#039;t fond of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Didn&#039;t like the OP, didn&#039;t like the ED, voice acting was standard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
Well what can I say, they so simple that I only need 1 line for each character.<br />
<br />
Takeo - Misunderstands, always resolves issues, &quot;SUKI DA~~~~&quot;. <br />
<br />
Suna - Single, good looking guy that gets all the girls attention and needs to instruct Takeo on how to do anything related to relationships.<br />
<br />
Yamato - Likes baking, get flustered when she&#039;s thinking of Takeo, always nice towards other people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
After the first few eps, it becomes tedious to even watch it while eating. If you want to watch it, watch it for the first few eps then don&#039;t bother because they will basically be the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Most overrated anime this season. Starts of great then becomes &#039;mystery meat&#039; stew where you basically know you&#039;re getting one of few choices and where each choice is bad in itself.

    Okay, now that I&#039;ve seen all the episodes, I can finally write a review about this extremely lovable anime, even though I&#039;ve never written a review before. I am absolutely smitten with this anime. <br />
<br />
Let me elaborate.<br />
<br />
WARNING: THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS SO PLEASE DON&#039;T READ IF YOU HAVEN&#039;T WATCHED THE ENTIRE THING.<br />
<br />
This anime tells a love story, obviously, as the title says. Our main character is Gouda Takeo, a 2-meter tall, muscular, even a bit scary-looking high school freshman who doesn&#039;t look his age by any means. Despite his scary appearance, he&#039;s good-hearted, energetic, always willing to help out anyone in need, which earns

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199461">
        respect from his classmates and also other girls (which he is painfully unaware of). Then there&#039;s his love interest, a teeny-tiny petite shy girl named Yamato Rinko, who is really into baking cookies, helping out others in need, basically, she&#039;s just as pure-hearted as Takeo. Their love story begins when Takeo saves Yamato from a groper while on the same train. The two fall in love on first sight, although Takeo has a hard time believing she really does like him, due to his unusual appearance and girls&#039; tendencies to dislike guys like him. Which is, frankly, so damn adorable. Takeo is not your usual anime dude. Even though he posesses superhuman strength and is adored by absolutely everyone who gets to know him, he is super modest and a little bit insecure. He also respects Yamato a great deal, going so far as having trouble calling her by her first name, being super nervous about holding her hand, promising not to even lay a finger on her until she wants him to. She, on the other hand, is embarassed by having occasional dirty thoughts about him, gets super excited about holding his hand, is amazed by his strength, always cheers for him, and so on. The contrast between the two (she&#039;s super-tiny and delicate while he&#039;s an awkward giant) is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. Their relationship is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. The story is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. even though it revolves mostly around their lovey-dovey encounters (&#039;Takeo-kun, I love you so much!&#039;, &#039;Aaaah, Yamato, I love you too!&#039; and so on and so forth). It&#039;s SO FREAKING ADORABLE that I don&#039;t even give a damn about the story not being as developed as you&#039;d expect it to be (hence why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). <br />
Though I must say, I really applaud the development in the latest episodes, and the small hardship the two faced (not gonna spoil it. But it&#039;s a happy ending, of course.)<br />
<br />
STORY: 9/10<br />
<br />
Maybe the reason why I liked this anime so freaking much is because I&#039;m in a relationship with a guy similar to Takeo... and we&#039;re kinda like Takeo and Yamato... so it hits too hard home. Oh well. :D<br />
<br />
ART: 10/10<br />
The art is really crisp, the colors are nice, the backgrounds are nice, basically there&#039;s nothing to dislike. The whole thing is very fresh-looking. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 10/10<br />
The soundtrack isn&#039;t as offputting as you&#039;d expect your typical shojo anime soundtrack to be. The opening song was actually really nice, I&#039;d sit through the opening humming along to it, which is what I never ever do (when I watch anime I usually skip openings, except if I really like the song). Whoever sings the opening and ending songs did a great job, their voice is really gentle and nice, and not making me want to stab my eardrums with a fork until they bleed. Background music during the episodes is also enjoyable, there&#039;s not a single thing to complain about.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6<br />
While I absolutely adore Takeo and Yamato, I found myself wanting to punch the writers in the face for not showing basically any background story relating to Takeo&#039;s best friend, Sunakawa-kun. Sunakawa-kun is your typical bishounen on the outside, extremely gorgeous, but very quiet and mysterious on the inside. But we don&#039;t find out anything about why is he like that. We don&#039;t know why doesn&#039;t he pursue girls (other than disliking them for talking shit about Takeo behind his back) and why is he always so distant. He has no other significance in the anime other than being around Takeo, helping out Takeo &#039;n shit... everything is always revolving around Takeo. I was hoping Sunakawa-kun would find a girlfriend by the end of the series, but I ended up being disappointed. The girl who showed up as a potential love interest for him ended up being turned down for no apparent reason even though she might be a good match for him. AND WE DIDN&#039;T EVEN GET ANY DEEPER EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WOULD HE REJECT HER, WHY IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. I was so, so, so disappointed. Also, Sunakawa-kun&#039;s sister... and the guy who&#039;s interested in her (Oda-kun)... very little to no development at all. The plot revolves way too much around Takeo for my liking and doesn&#039;t give space to other characters and their development. Which made me really sad and disappointed. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10<br />
Even despite the aforementioned flaws in character development, I really enjoyed this anime, as I&#039;ve stated before. It&#039;s not your typical shojo anime, it&#039;s crisp, enjoyable, and it&#039;s definitely worth a shot if you want to watch something light and cheerful without any deeper story to it. For all of you out there who like adorable love stories but with a slightly different charm to it, without a lot of shojo cliches, you could really enjoy this anime. I absolutely recommend it. ^^<br />
<br />
Hope this review was helpful enough. Cheers!

    There have been great wonders built during the long and extensive lifetime of the world:  The Pyramids of Giza, The Temple of Artemis, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and more, lovingly referred to as the &quot;Seven Wonders of the World.&quot;  While historians may ignore or discredit it as simply another Japanese cartoon, despite its lack of global influence, &quot;Ore Monogatari!!&quot; is a masterfully crafted work of art that should be supplemented to the Wonders of the World.  This bitterly short yet absolutely breathtaking show emphasizes a line of old knowledge uttered by wise individuals throughout time:  &quot;Never judge a book by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354020">
        its cover.&quot;  At surface glance, the main character is an obese and overly large buffoon characterized solely by his size; however, as the viewer continues their journey into the most amazing experience he or she will ever have, they quickly begin to notice that the main character is the perfect culmination of humanity&#039;s struggles and accomplishments, serving as the peak of any literary character development.  &quot;Ore Monogatari!!&quot; may be a tool of entertainment intended by its producers to turn a profit, but whether intentional or not, the writers and the cartoonists at Madhouse have created a cultural masterpiece that may one day usher in an era of global peace.

    Gouda Takeo is an unusually large freshman in high school. He&#039;s large and muscular and not conventionally attractive, but he&#039;s a teddy bear on the inside. His closest friend is Sunakawa Makoto, an introverted bishounen who is basically the polar opposite of Takeo. One day Takeo notices a girl being groped on a train, and he saves her. She falls in love with both his good moral character and appearance instantly, and he falls for her as well. The two of them begin a romantic journey together. <br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari!! stands out from other romantic comedies largely because of its unattractive male lead. Most shoujo romances

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199377">
        feature delicate bishounen who bear more resemblance to Suna, and &quot;ugly&quot; characters like Takeo are usually portrayed as disgusting stalker otaku. The series also defies stereotypes when Suna manages to clear up all the cliché misunderstandings in just one episode and ultimately gets Yamato and Takeo to confess to each other. In this regard, Ore Monogatari!! is revolutionary. <br />
<br />
Another thing Ore Monogatari!! does very well is portraying friendship between guys. Typical shoujo often ignore the friendships between male friends, so it&#039;s refreshing and heart-warming to see the &quot;bro&quot; relationship between Takeo and Suna, as well as between Takeo and his other friends. Suna is, without a doubt, the best character in this series. I can honestly say that I watched this show almost entirely for him. <br />
<br />
That being said, Ore Monogatari!! has some substantial flaws. While it has a unique premise, its comedy becomes overused quickly. While I enjoyed the comedy once a week, it would be tiresome to watch in one sitting. To reference a MAL review, most jokes have to do with Takeo&#039;s size, Suna&#039;s appearance, Takeo and Suna&#039;s unlikely friendship, or Takeo and Yamato&#039;s innocence. The jokes are repetitive, and nothing really new is brought to the comedy spectrum. <br />
<br />
The other big issue with Ore Monogatari!! is that there are no real problems in Takeo and Yamato&#039;s relationship. They both have insecurities, sure, but those insecurities are dealt with quickly so that the two can return to fluff. The only really significant insecurity comes right at the end of the series, and it&#039;s given barely any time to develop. A resolution is shoved in our faces with very little time left in the series, and as a result, there is no time for the characters to undergo any development with this final trial. <br />
<br />
While it certainly is true that Ore Monogatari!! distinguishes itself from other shoujo by clearing up the misunderstandings within three episodes, there&#039;s a reason cliché shoujo drag out romance so much: it provides a goal for the series. Other successful shoujo romance anime like Kimi ni Todoke, Lovely Complex, and Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, which I might add were all two-cour series, took a lot longer for the romance to develop. While it was frustrating at times, it provided viewers with something to look forward to. On the other hand, the entirety of Ore Monogatari!! starting from episode 3 is in the couple&#039;s honeymoon phase, and we don&#039;t get to see the realistic, less pretty side of relationships. All we get from them is &quot;Takeo-kun, daisuki!&quot; and &quot;SUKI DA!!!&quot;. Despite Takeo and Yamato liking each other, there&#039;s so much they have yet to learn about one another. There&#039;s so much they may not agree on, yet we haven&#039;t seen any of it. <br />
<br />
Aside from the story, there are a few other things to consider. The art is prety good, and it does a good job emphasizing just how different Yamato, Takeo and Suna are. The reaction scenes (especially Suna&#039;s) are done really well. The soundtrack of the series is pretty, and complements romantic moments well. It chimes in at the right moments. <br />
<br />
Despite its flaws I mentioned above, I really enjoyed this anime. Maybe that sounds hypocritical now, but I really did like it. It addresses not only romance but also platonic friendships, difficult family situations, and even introducing a new life into the world! But like I said earlier, I don&#039;t think I could stomach watching it in one sitting. The overused jokes and fluff are nice once a week, but not if you&#039;re trying to marathon the show. The lack of real issues is frustrating. The sheer length of Ore Monogatari!! was its greatest flaw, and I believe it would have been a lot more successful as a one-cour series. <br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Art: 7 <br />
Sound: 6<br />
Character: 6 <br />
Enjoyment: 8 <br />
Overall score: 6/10 <br />
Do I recommend it? YES! (Just take breaks every now and then)

    Shoujo romance has been very formulaic as of late.  You either have the perfect boy with the perfect features or what have you, falling or trying to woo over the inadequate or least popular girl in the entire school, or you have a pair of adorable people who for love of all that is good and holy don&#039;t even confess to each other AT ALL.  So, we have a predicament here.  We have a shoujo romance that has neither of those things as its base story line so...what do we do with Ore Monogatari then?<br />
<br />
Story: Gouda Takeo is a first year high-schooler.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199369">
         Known by many of the people at school as a VERY large individual (about 6&#039;4&quot; in height), all Takeo ever wanted, was to get a girl to like him back.  Throughout the years through no fault of his own, Takeo has always been unable to confess to the girls he likes because of his unintentionally suave friend, Makoto Sunakawa.  So, after going into high school and saving a girl from a groper on a train, he meets the lovely (and ridiculously tiny) girl, Rinko Yamato, and thus a new crush begins.  <br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari plays a lot like your general shoujo romance slice of life comedy show.  (Wow that is a lot of genres)  Unlike a good number of shoujo romance where the main couple ALMOST reaches the point where they can maybe sorta want to kind of perhaps date each other, Ore Monogatari puts the majority of its runtime straight into the &quot;these people are actually dating&quot; category since post episode three, the main characters in the series actually do get together and begin dating each other, which is nice.  However post the confession, what do we have?  Well, we have various things, actually.  <br />
<br />
Aside from spending time with our main couple and showcasing that this show did indeed put two people together to the extent and comfort level that they can hold hands, kiss, have all sorts of lovey dovey moments, the show also focuses on essentially, building up on that.  Every few episodes, they add in a new shoujo romance trope in order to &quot;test&quot; their love, so to speak.  These include the standard things like, acceptance from spouse&#039;s friends, love rivals, spending time alone, more love rivals, and finally, a love rival for the other side.  (Yeah, lot of love rivals.)  As such, Ore Monogatari doesn&#039;t really part ways from the standard &quot;Shoujo tropes&quot; that it comes from.  Sure there are a couple episodes and even an entire section that are not devoted entirely to the main couple, but in comparison, those mini side stories don&#039;t hold as much value as the original story.  <br />
<br />
In the end, Ore Monogatari is admittedly a very sweet anime with a very odd looking couple.  It ends on a gentle slope so there&#039;re really no issues there, but the show didn&#039;t try to differ itself from traditional shoujo aside from its &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; motif with the characters&#039; various heights.  A lot of it was still stuff you see from a generic shoujo and it didn&#039;t really try and differ itself a lot in that aspect.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Interesting main couple<br />
+ Actual progression in the relationship<br />
-  Most of the story was similar and/or bland<br />
-  Story played off like a normal shoujo romance<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters in Ore Monogatari take up two different camps.  The main characters, and everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with our main protagonist, Gouda Takeo.  Takeo, as mentioned before, is a very large human.  He is big, he is strong, he can somehow move faster than a motor vehicle, and he&#039;s too nice to people to the extent that he won&#039;t consider his own feelings before someone else&#039;s.  (Also, he&#039;s kind of dense.)  He&#039;s like a big teddy bear and he wants to be helpful to everyone as much as he possibly can.  As the series goes on, we get to see Takeo change as he grows to truly treasure his girlfriend Rinko and values their relationship immensely, mostly with the phrase &quot;I love her&quot;, which is basically said about every 30 seconds whenever he&#039;s on screen, which I hate.  One particular thing about the main couple is the fact that their entire personality can sort of be described by their catchphrase.  For Takeo, it&#039;s &quot;I love her&quot;, which tells you that well, he loves her and wants her to be happy.  <br />
<br />
Then we have Rinko Yamato, Takeo&#039;s fun-sized girlfriend who has an addiction to making cakes.  As a character, Rinko is a very enthusiastic girl.  Particularly, she is very enthusiastic by trying to make Takeo happy as every 30 seconds she spouts out &quot;Takeo&#039;s so cool!&quot; and other synonyms to that.  In comparison, Yamato doesn&#039;t really have the growth that Takeo has, though putting one without the other is like taking strawberries out of shortcake.  The issue I have is that as a character, Rinko doesn&#039;t stand out as an individual person, mostly because her defining traits are making sweets, and loving Takeo, and that&#039;s about it.  She can&#039;t stand by herself as an individual character, and as such, really puts a sour taste to this supposedly really sweet story.  <br />
<br />
And finally, Makoto Sunakawa, the pretty boy that HAS to exist in every shoujo ever.  Sunakawa is the pinnacle of the perfect &quot;bro&quot; character.  Able to see what is happening in any situation including aiding the baka couple that he hangs out with often, Suna acts behind the scenes in any given moment in the anime and tries to help Takeo especially with his love, acting more like a support than anything.  Suna is always the calm one in any frenzy, is always the one to drag Takeo back to earth, and is always there to help with any issues that his friend has, looking out for him like a good older brother figure of sorts.  The issue I have is the fact that the show treats him as the anchor to the relationship and doesn&#039;t really expand him out all that much.  They do devote a couple episodes to him, but only really one TRULY focuses on him, and even so, doesn&#039;t really explain much to me about him as a character.<br />
<br />
The side characters in Ore Monogatari act as friends or family of either of the three main characters.  For the most part, these side characters serve to add the conflict to the story by challenging one of the two main characters (mostly Takeo) and testing the couple&#039;s love by trying to impart their own selfish desires.  But it&#039;s all good cause they all become friends, right?  :p  Nonetheless, side characters are mostly plot devices with a role that only fits into a certain part of the story before disappearing in order to make room for the next set of side characters in the next arc.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent character development for some<br />
-  The main cast requires each other and cannot stand alone<br />
-  Repetition of lines (seriously, they have Takeo say &quot;I love you&quot; at least 5-6 times/episode.)<br />
-  Side characters are simply plot devices<br />
<br />
Art: Ore Monogatari&#039;s style of art is what you would expect from a shoujo romance.  The colors are all extremely light and are very bright and flowery, and especially with the character designs with the jewel-like eyes and the detailed lips, Ore Monogatari very much resembles a general shoujo and the style that they&#039;re drawn in.  In addition, the detail of the show doesn&#039;t really waver all the much except during comedic moments, so that&#039;s nice.<br />
<br />
As for comedy, Ore Monogatari hosts a lot of exaggerations and exaggerated expressions to precisely encapsulate what they want to show you.  Dialing back the detail in some cases, the comedic appearance of the show varies from scene to scene, but mostly stays in the realm of changing the way the characters are drawn and especially, Takeo&#039;s perspective.  (Cause my god, it he huge.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent art<br />
+ Good detail<br />
-  Generic Shoujo-style artwork<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound for Ore Monogatari is a mix of melancholy and uplifting.  For its OP, we have its iconic &quot;Answer&quot;, a cute little song that talks about cakes and asking for an answer.  (Which the question I assume is, Do you love me, or something.)  It&#039;s a nice uplifting song that tells you what you should expect going into it, a little love story that plays off of the idea of whether the main couple actually love each other or not.  <br />
<br />
And for its ED, we have &quot;Shiawase no Arika&quot;, a melancholic piece that plays towards those moments of doubt that the show attempts to showcase to its audience.  It&#039;s a nice little rock song that has that feeling of hope to it.  It&#039;s nice, but it doesn&#039;t hold a candle to the OP in terms of memorabilia.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Decent soundtrack<br />
+ Memorable OP<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: When I first was told about Ore Monogatari, and how it was an actually good Shoujo, I was a bit apprehensive, since Shoujo romance hasn&#039;t really changed drastically in terms of story for a lot of anime.  But, when the characters actually got together early on, then my interest was piqued. <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this anime?<br />
<br />
Kind of.  I liked the show early on as they tried to light this fire that this newly formed couple had since it was the start of the relationship and I was curious about how things would go.  I also really like Suna as a character (since he is the best bro), and the OP to the whole series is a pretty enjoyable track.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I enjoy about this anime?<br />
<br />
As the series went on, the show got incredibly repetitive, as there were a bunch of love rivals for the story that came every few episodes and took hold of the show for a good little while before releasing, go into something completely unrelated, before going back to it.  The repetitiveness of the plot as well as the fact that the main characters couldn&#039;t say a different line half the time soured the experience a little.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a fan of shoujo or you REALLY like sweet relationships, this is the show for you.  The entire show is about its main couple really with only 4 or so episodes focused on other characters, and each of those are one-off for different characters.  Because of the way its story is made, aside from its odd couple, there isn&#039;t much beyond a generic shoujo.  If you&#039;re fine with that, then go for it.  If not, then maybe this anime isn&#039;t for you.

    The most important aspect of romance anime is usually its characters. If there is a solid cast, the viewer is automatically satisfied even if the story is not the most outstanding. The same principle applies for Ore Monogatari.<br />
<br />
Aired in Spring 2015 and animated by Studio Madhouse, this two-cours anime follows Gouda Takeo, an unpopular male who does not manage to find a girlfriend even though he has longed for one since he had been in kindergarten. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, his unusual appearance and, on the other hand, his awkward behaviour. People who are not acquainted with Takeo think he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199340">
        is scary due to his height and his loud nature. However, most of his classmates are his friends – in fact, one could even say they admire him – which clearly shows that Takeo is not your typical unpopular protagonist. He is a good person who would do anything to help other people even though he has to surmount dangerous situations he probably would not survive without his apparent super-human strength. Due to this and several other factors, Takeo is one of the most loveable characters of present-day anime.<br />
<br />
The female lead of the series, Yamato Rinko, frequently has to explain to her friends why she likes Takeo. At the beginning of the anime, said friends do not comprehend her behaviour but as it continues, they, too, begin to understand that Takeo not only is not scary at all but also would do anything for Yamato to be happy. Unfortunately, the female protagonist&#039;s character is not the most compelling. The viewer is presented with the fact that she likes baking but other than that she possesses only few distinguishable character traits. She has a charming personality and is the cause of some interesting character development concerning Takeo but regrettably lacks in depth. There are a lot of supporting characters who have both a more interesting background story and greater character development than her. While this might show another positive side of the anime – namely, its great supporting cast – it also demonstrates how Yamato&#039;s character pales in comparison.<br />
<br />
Another important character is Takeo&#039;s best friend, Sunakawa Makoto. Suna is the complete opposite of Takeo: He is charming, good-looking and popular. However, similar to Takeo, he also has never had a girlfriend even though his reasons are different in that he is the person who does not want a relationship. Suna mostly acts as the person who helps Takeo in several situations that he does not understand. Moreover, he might be the main reason why the protagonists&#039; relationship is as strong as it is. However, this does not mean that Suna is a simple plot device without a personality on his own. In fact, he is incredibly amusing since he also is socially awkward in some situations – but differently from Takeo – and is the anime&#039;s second-most interesting character.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, the anime&#039;s supporting characters are great. Not only do they trigger interesting development for Takeo but each of them has a unique backstory and believable growth. There might be some characters you do not find very likeable but, in the end, you will have to admit that all of them serve a purpose and fit into the anime incredibly well.<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s plot mostly focuses on Takeo&#039;s and Yamato&#039;s relationship in different environments. You can see them interact with one another in the park, at the restaurant, or in an amusement park. Moreover, you are presented with some hardships they have to face that seem to threaten their relationship. The outcome is completely predictable and while there is a lack of drama, you have to understand that Ore Monogatari does not need it. At its core, this anime is about the light-hearted relationship between its two main characters and any unnecessary drama would only hurt it. However, if it were not for the solid cast, this would not be the case. An episodic anime whose story seems to be repetitive such as this one is only able to function if its characters make every episode a unique experience. That being said, there are some moments which seem to exist in order to spice up the anime&#039;s story but they are not too bothering and may even prevent the anime from becoming boring.<br />
<br />
The art style is really simple and not especially detailed. However, in the case of Ore Monogatari, this is not a bad thing. On the contrary, the simplicity underlines the anime&#039;s light-heartedness and consequently improves its atmosphere. Additionally, more exciting scenes are much more detailed, which increases those scenes&#039; credibility.<br />
<br />
The background music is not necessarily memorable but simply adds to the anime&#039;s atmosphere, which is perfectly fine. The opening theme, on the other hand, is incredibly catchy and sets the proper mood at the beginning of each episode. The ending theme, while being a nice song on its own, unfortunately does not fit the anime due to its melancholic tone.<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari is not a comedy anime. It does have some funny moments but its quality is not based on those. Instead, the comedy adds to the cast&#039;s likeability rather than being one of the anime&#039;s strong aspects on its own. Moreover, if you are looking for an anime with a compelling story and a lot of plot twists, this one is probably not to your liking. However, if you wanted me to recommend an anime without unnecessary melodrama but with heart-warming moments, a great atmosphere and light-hearted interactions, my first advice would be Ore Monogatari.

    I haven&#039;t even finished this anime, but I wanted to write a review..that&#039;s how good it is.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s definitely Shoujo. It&#039;s 24 episodes of cute and adorable. The story had me crying happy tears for these two almost the whole time. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve cried this much over cuteness overload since  Clannad. (Happy tears, not sad. Just noting that.)<br />
<br />
The art may not be some people&#039;s cup of tea. But, I think it suited the story. The backgrounds are very pretty. The effects were adorable and sparkly. The opening theme and music were totally perfect. I actually found myself watching the opening at times cause

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205128">
        of how cute it was with the song..but, maybe that&#039;s just me!<br />
<br />
The main characters are totally clueless, but it suites them to boot. The story of how they met was a nice heart warming introduction. The characters play well with each other. The boyfriend is a giant &quot;bear&quot; that everyone fears. But, some look up to because of his warm heart. The girlfriend is sweet and can see the beauty in someone, despite the outside appearance. Both very trusting. And, the best friend of the boyfriend is a handsome, but kind and gentle person who really helps push things through. He really is a good best friend, and only the story can really explain it. You have to watch to see!<br />
<br />
Overall, The story basically is their cupcake phase, and what most young girls would dream for their first relationship to be like. Each episode always made me smile, and if you like these kinds..I hope you take the time to ride through the whole season!

    Ore Monogatari!! is a series that looks unconventional at first glance but a second look reveals that it adheres to every trope of romance animes.<br />
<br />
Plot arcs with misunderstanding as the foundation? Check.<br />
Third parties? Check.<br />
Impossibly optimistic leads? Check.<br />
Unsubstantial episodic fluff? Check.<br />
<br />
The characters are also not Ore Monogatari!!&#039;s strengths. Takeo&#039;s unconventional looks for a male shoujo lead feels gimmicky. While it&#039;s true that he was ridiculed by the girls he liked back then, it was glossed over and the series portrayed him as a someone who is much loved by everyone. Swap him to a bland looking guy  but retain his behavior and we will still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203311">
        get the same results. Suna is the most interesting character in the series for being observant while emotionally distant but was not given proper development. Yamato was not given much task aside from being cute and a doting girlfriend.<br />
<br />
You cannot also rely on the show&#039;s humor as it borders too much on slapstick or events which require the audience&#039;s suspension of disbelief (Takeo&#039;s blissful ignorance of a &#039;university exclusively for females&#039; and the restaurant incident.) There are also some episodes that are reminiscent of countless romantic anime before and bore the heck out of the viewers.<br />
<br />
No major conflict occurred in this series which might shake Yamato and Takeo&#039;s relationship. What we received is their daily fluff that while admittedly sweet, is never substantial. Yet to dismiss Ore Monogatari!! as bland is also not warranted as it shows occasional moments of excellence.<br />
<br />
The musical score of Ore Monogatari!! was one of the year&#039;s most moving and was used in perfect timing with emotional scenes. The voice actors also did their best (although Takeo sounds grating at times) to bring these characters to life. Ore Monogatari!! is also a rare case where the ED is much better than the OP.<br />
<br />
When it gets its groove, it really stands out. In Ore Monogatari!!&#039;s defense, it only took three episodes before Takeo and Yamato became a couple in the most awkward yet endearing way possible. The poignant scenes in this series are really moving and hit the right spot for shoujo junkies. The couple&#039;s technically second kiss counts as one of the finest moment of 2015. However, episodes revolving the side characters (Suna&#039;s sister, Shijou and Yamato&#039;s friend) and Suna are the better representatives of this genre for being believable and well-developed characters. <br />
<br />
These flashes of brilliance do not absolve this series for playing too safe and for following religiously to the tropes which made the shoujo genre dull.  So probably, maybe, it will be a long time before a series can dethrone Kimi Ni Todoke as my most favorite conventional shoujo series.

    An anime series which has a very light-hearted premise. Individual characters were very likable and interesting in their own regards. What I like most regarding this series is that it doesn&#039;t have a convoluted plot and follows a linear flow of story, conflicts that were introduced are usually solved within the next few episodes thus there are no persistent conflict throughout the series. <br />
<br />
The pacing was consistent and the romance doesn&#039;t feel dragged out and you would always expect a development on the relationship between the main characters. <br />
<br />
Its flaw on the other hand is that it simply does not strive to overachieve in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335665">
        sense that every episode follows the same formulaic pattern resulting on a slightly generic plot. But other than that I do highly recommend you checking this out. (weirdly enough, the wholesomeness was stress-relieving)

The afternoon October air is chilly, cold enough to make the use of a jacket mandatory. Despite the temperature, the butterflies refused to cease their fluttering. First, a restaurant dinner. Second, a stroll through the park. Third, a comfy movie. And now fourth, a shopping trip through the city. It is our fourth date, you think to yourself, calm down already! The butterflies do not listen.<br />
<br />
You are waiting near the agreed-upon fountain, an easy marker to find among the large crowd of people. You start to scan for her face, jumping while doing so both to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206537">
        get a better view and to heat you up. Finally, you opt to stand on the edge of the fountain, the butterflies making it easier to make that step up. Just as you do so, you see her. A rose among daffodils. She is wearing jeans, a button up coat, and glinting earrings, her long, brown hair resting gracefully on her back.<br />
<br />
She is looking around; you hope she is looking for you. When her eyes lock with yours, they gleam brighter than the stones on her ears. She pushes past the crowd as you float down from off the fountain’s edge. When she reaches you, October turns to April, her wonderful smile warming you from within.<br />
<br />
“You look…great,” you manage to exhale, her radiance momentarily stealing your breath. Her cheeks grow rosier as she casts her head down. You think you might have said something wrong, but suddenly she lifts her head back up while standing slightly on her toes to kiss you. The kiss does not last long, but the softness and the sweetness calms the butterflies completely. When she pulls away, your smile mirrors her own. You reach for her hand, her and your fingers interlacing instinctively. The feeling within you is something you have never felt before, but you know that, like the girl standing next to you, you never want to let it go.<br />
<br />
Love is a beautiful thing, something that everyone deserves to experience. Filled with romance, skip-a-beat situations, and of course love, Ore Monogatari!! delivers this message with all its heart.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari does not have a plot. That is a half-truth: the plot exists within the first three or so episodes, but after Takeo and Rinko officially start dating, the anime transitions into more or less a slice-of-life show that focuses on love and all that that means.<br />
<br />
As Haddaway would ask, “What is love?” Love is a fickle creature that comes and goes, can be found in all shapes and sizes, and has the strange property of being understood by anyone, no matter the culture, location, or upbringing. Love is an emotion, a feeling that resonates with the soul and strains the heart. On its own, love is a purely serene entity. But what surrounds it is hardship, sadness, and turmoil. This is what makes love so sweet: getting past the hard, outer shell and finding that gentle, inner beauty.<br />
<br />
Thus Ore Monogatari centers in on this beauty. Looking at every angle of romance is how the anime accomplishes this goal. The show showcases the initial nervousness and anxiety of people who have a crush on one another. Then it demonstrates worry and pain, followed by a period of time where meeting-up becomes infrequent. Afterwards going on dates, caring for the people around them besides just each other, and outside crushes wanting in are more instances of the anime trying – and succeeding – at revealing as many sides to romance as possible. With each passing scenario, the audience learns more about love than previously known, thereby moving the anime that much closer towards its own goal. Ore Monogatari also contains large milestones: overcoming the confession, having that first kiss, and (relative to anime) using the girlfriend’s first name. These bigger moments are interspersed throughout the tale, giving a sort of rising and falling action of the events. That is to say, lesser romance ideas are had, then a greater one, proceeded by lesser romance ideas again, and so on. This kind of progression slowly increases love’s boundaries, but that is how love is. Love is nurtured, a delicate flower that blooms into elegance the more it is cared for.<br />
<br />
Caring does not only exist between Takeo and Rinko. Cleverly, the anime involves the rest of the cast in the love-filled festivities, therefore exploring the theme even more. Oda loves Suna’s older sister but is blocked by her feelings for Takeo. Takeo’s afro friend hooks up with one of Rinko’s friends after the two realize that the other person is not always perfect. Ichinose’s confession gives Rinko the opportunity to show the existence of true, everlasting love. The plot takes the time to displace love away from the main couple now and again, and in doing so the anime explores love through a wider lens, thus expounding on its theme of love that much more.<br />
<br />
Arguably the best scenario from the entire season also does not directly revolve around Takeo and Rinko. Instead, it is the arc starring Suna and Yukika, the Valentine’s letter girl. This scenario is wonderful for one reason: Suna rejects Yukika. It is a poignant moment but it is so powerful because it rounds out love’s complexity. Someone might love another but that does not automatically mean the love has to be reciprocated. The aftermath, though, does not defeat Yukika. Rather, it invigorates her to try harder, to become someone better than herself. As for Suna, he continues being himself while emphasizing that love is not something to rush into. Collectively, the arc, and especially the direction the arc takes, proves how well the anime explores its theme of love.<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari also, in order to fully explore its theme, targets love that exists between other couplings, meaning not just between two people who have fallen for one another. The biggest example is Takeo and Suna. The former is there to support his friend during trying family times. The latter patiently listens, providing wisdom to his friend when he needs it (and he needs it often). For both, the love they share is that of best friends, the kind of connection that only the best of buds are capable of understanding. Takeo’s mother demonstrates the love for a son and vice versa. Suna and Ai demonstrate the love between siblings, and so on. Thus the anime, combined with its other areas, explores love as completely as it can, clearly demonstrating the show’s total strength.<br />
<br />
The anime’s extensive use of love can be viewed metaphorically. The anime is a heart, each ventricle a new arc, each pump a new set of events, and each beat a new feeling. Like any heart, though, defects exist. Most prominent is the repetitiveness. For the comedy, it often relies on the same jokes: Takeo saying “I love her” alongside an imaginative concept, Rinko getting embarrassed when dealing with normal activities, and Suna acting unfazed by much of the stuff that happens around him. For the general proceedings, it often relies on the same direction: Takeo going beyond superhuman to help out his girlfriend, Rinko frequently giving a beaming smile for the audience to imprint on their mind, and Suna always tagging along.<br />
<br />
To clarify, the repetitiveness does not affect the events themselves; the theme of love is explored nicely precisely because Ore Monogatari varies up the surrounding situations consistently. Repetitiveness is not automatically a negative, but since the show does not use the repetition in a meaningful manner, it comes off as obtrusive rather than constructive. In a way, though, such repetition is natural: a heart beats and beats and beats. A heart repeatedly goes through its motions, involuntarily and forever. In the realistic case, however, the heart’s repetition is mandatory. In Ore Monogatari’s case, not so much.<br />
<br />
Still, this heart is healthy enough to keep going, carrying love to every part of itself without fail.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari sticks with a “lighter” art style throughout the season. Most of the show takes place during the day with bountiful sunlight. When nighttime is shown, streetlamps, the moon, and other lighting fixtures – such as Christmas lights and at-home bulbs – brighten the area. The purpose: to keep the anime cheerful in atmosphere. After all, love is ultimately a happy and fulfilling emotion, so maintaining a cheery mood coincides with the show’s own goals.<br />
<br />
The show is also diverse in the backgrounds it uses. A local zoo, the beach, parts of the city, a nearby mountain trail, their apartments, and an amusement park are all visited, giving the anime a dynamic feel and therefore a feeling of liveliness. Again, these types of feelings are important since they match the theme of love that permeates the show. Alongside the realistic backgrounds are the imaginative ones. These usually happen when one of the gang – especially Takeo – starts to think about something intently – in Takeo’s case, Rinko. They can take on any form, from planets to European landscapes, but they are always quite detailed.<br />
<br />
Detailed as well are the character designs, Takeo in particular for his given size. Of course, he is massive, the anime using this feature of his for comedic effect at most points. But his size has two other purposes. One, his size forms a dichotomy with Rinko’s short stature – thinking about love, “opposites attract.” And two, his hugeness represents the size of his heart – he is the very definition of a gentle giant. His huge lips, short hair, and squinty eyes continue to paint him as the lovable dude that he is. Also lovable is Rinko, her large eyes, beaming smile, and natural blushing making her undeniably cute. Better yet, the show constantly switches her design, changing her hair-do and outfit for a myriad of occasions, giving her a varied set of appearances to show off her cuteness. As for Suna, he is known for his extreme handsomeness derived from his extreme plainness. His hair is normal, his eyes are normal, and his face is normal, turning him into a “real” person. And that is the point: Suna, given his role, is the “odd man out” in the sense that Takeo’s overt largeness and Rinko’s overt adorableness are accentuated when the completely plain Suna is nearby. The rest of the cast is similarly detailed in their designs: Takeo’s father with his strangely off-kilter looks, Rinko’s friends with their different getups, and Suna’s sister with her aura of maturity, giving the character designs a higher overall amount of execution.<br />
<br />
Execution persists in the actual animation. Facial expressions for Takeo and Rinko morph constantly, hair and limbs move when speaking, and objects shift when used throughout the season. Small effects like glinting stars or contorting lips and more involved scenarios like Takeo jumping out of a burning building or Takeo running down the side of a mountain (the majority of the more animation-intensive segments have Takeo performing some unbelievable feat) keep the anime’s actual animation high despite how much it relies on capturing singular, still-frame moments during the season.<br />
<br />
The art elevates itself further with even more features. The show includes visible writing, where a character’s current thoughts pop up next to him or her rather than said out loud in order to understand what he or she is thinking without taking away from the current situation. Comedy-oriented designs, such as minimalist portraits or wacky faces, maintain the show’s fun atmosphere. And the anime’s minute details, such as the defined lines of Takeo’s and the other characters faces and the expert use of shadows, cement Ore Monogatari as an anime whose artistic and animation direction was always given special attention from start to finish.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari has a sizeable cast but more or less focuses on three characters in particular: Takeo, Rinko, and Suna, or colloquially the brawn, the beauty, and the brains.<br />
<br />
As a kid, Takeo grew up surrounded by friends and family, his kindhearted behavior naturally attracting people to him. However he was never popular with girls, mostly because of his size and his often crazy actions. But after protecting Rinko, he (and she) found love, providing him with the relationship he had always wanted. Understandably, then, Takeo is not the best when it comes to love and how to handle it: he sometimes does not speak his mind, he often reads Rinko’s thoughts wrong, and he regularly misunderstands what has happened or what he can do. Still, Takeo never lets his shortcomings deter him. Instead he takes his love for Rinko as fuel to treat her and their relationship with as much respect and care as humanly – in this context, Takeo-ly – possible. So he tries his hardest at a judo match to make his time away from Rinko purposeful, he studies his mind out to go to the same university as his girlfriend, and he supports Rinko at her new job to boost her confidence in her own skills. Takeo is a man that always has others – especially Rinko – in his thoughts, with his actions, his monologues, and his disposition always demonstrating his never-ending love.<br />
<br />
Rinko is similar in the sense that she deeply loves Takeo. Rinko makes him desserts nearly daily, she declares her feelings as clear as day, and she is always doing her best to push her and Takeo’s relationship forward. This last point is important: knowing that Takeo is the ignorant one when it comes to love, it falls on Rinko to take the initiative, which she does in stunning fashion. Rinko tries to make Takeo’s heart “skip a beat” at the beach, she rests on his chest to snuggle with him, and she leans in first for that first kiss. Rinko, not Takeo, leads the relationship where it needs to go. This stems from her “non-pure” motives, an early spot of conflict for her character. Initially she believed that her wanting to hold hands or hold Takeo was a turn off to him due to his constant praising of her innocent nature. But such desires are perfectly fine for anyone, especially when said person is in love. So for Rinko, her more instinctual feelings are not a detriment but rather a boon that makes her relationship with Takeo slowly but surely evolve beyond what it has already become.<br />
<br />
The advancement of their relationship is necessary considering that their relationship is technically the main focus of the anime. Watching as Takeo and Rinko fall for one another, care for one another, and of course love one another is what allows their individual characters to blossom. And like their character designs, “opposites attract,” meaning the kind of give and take they share is opposite to how they are perceived as being. For example, Takeo is huge but treats Rinko like a delicate flower when he refrains from ogling her body in a swimsuit. Rinko, likewise, is tiny but is not afraid to make moves that are bigger than herself when she kisses Takeo on the cheek when he is sleeping soundly. While they, at times, act differently towards each other than they do to the people around them, there is one area where they agree wholeheartedly: trust. Takeo trusts Rinko and Rinko trusts Takeo. Saijou might confess her feelings towards her “Master” and Ichinose might confess his feelings towards his “muse,” but both Takeo and Rinko know that they will never lose sight of the love they mutually have for one another.<br />
<br />
However, Takeo and Rinko’s relationship cannot survive on its own; indeed, their relationship would never have come to fruition without the aid of a particular male. Perhaps obviously, this person is none other than Suna. Arguably the strongest character of Ore Monogatari, Suna is their rock. Suna is not so much a third wheel as he is the spokes that support the lovebirds. When Takeo needs help planning a date or needs to express himself using emoticons, Suna is the first person he goes to. When Rinko needs advice on how to get closer to Takeo or needs ideas on what cake to make for Takeo’s birthday, Suna is the first person she goes to. Suna is always there for them, ready with wisdom to set them (and anyone, really) down the path of success. That is to say, as a person he is not just respectful but immeasurably kind.<br />
<br />
Kindness alone, though, does not make a character strong. Unlike Takeo, Rinko, and many other members of the cast, he does not have those feelings of love. In fact, it is the opposite: despite how many women have approached him, he has never returned their feelings. Like Rinko’s base desires, this is normal. Suna’s decision to not have a lover is the anime yet again exploring its theme of love, but more profound than this is what this means for his character. Suna does not have a partner to share his time with, so the relationships he has with both Takeo and Rinko mean the world to him. Suna does not help them out because he is obligated; he helps them out because he values them and the bond they share. He is thankful that Takeo makes him laugh when Takeo simply acts like himself. He is thankful to Rinko for showing him sides of his best friend that he has never seen before. Thus he repays their own kindness with kindness of his own, to prove that they are the people in his life he loves deeply.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that Suna does not have personal troubles of his own. Early in the season, Suna’s father has health issues that force him into the hospital, thereby affecting Suna immensely. Later in the season, Suna has a potential love interest that could be the correct match for him. Therefore Takeo and Rinko, respective to these situations, support Suna, helping him to overcome the struggles he faces both within and without. Thus Suna is not the only one supporting; Takeo and Rinko in turn support him. Collectively, the three of them love each other in a way that is appropriate for the bonds they share, their overall relationship highlighting the beauty of love. To put it differently: uniquely and cleverly, Takeo, Rinko, and Suna are not a typical love triangle.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The opening theme for Ore Monogatari is a treat for the ears. The range of the vocalist, the strange sound effects in the background, and the dropping beat make the arrangement playful, energetic, and fun. Alongside the beginning piano, the intermittent choir, and the concluding guitar, the entire piece is filled with love both in the sound it oozes and in the feeling it exudes, making it a perfect fit for the anime itself.<br />
<br />
The ending theme, opposing its OP counterpart, slows everything down, both in beat and in tone. The piece embraces simplicity, guitar, drums, and a singer making up the majority of the track. However, this piece is arguably filled with more heart; the build-up, the lyrics, and the instruments initially generate a distinct feeling of longing that, at just the right moment, gives way to elation. Metaphorically, the piece feels as if someone has gone a long time searching for love, finding out that it was closer to him than he had ever thought possible, making the ED another perfect outing.<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtrack consists of both serene and poignant pieces that touch the heart and move the soul. “Fond Memories” is a slow and heavy piano that really does instill a sense of nostalgia for those reflecting moments in the show. “Ore no Tatakai,” with its violins and trumpets, pumps one’s adrenaline for those intense scenes. “Story of Mind ~ Little Love” is a beautiful, and indeed tiny, piece that is filled to the brim with happiness and joy to match those likewise joyous occasions. “You made my day” has flutes and a choir that make it feel as if heaven itself has descended, making the heartfelt times that much heartier. And “Scenery” has a particular gentleness that soothes the mind upon every listen.<br />
<br />
Besides these dramatic pieces, the anime can get less serious and more comical with others, such as “Bajitoufuu” with its drawling beat or “Haru no Kaze” with its dual guitars upping the mood considerably. Or the show can give that slice-of-life feel that the anime has with tracks like “Hot Hitoiki” that combine a piano with guitars to create quite the relaxing melody. But no matter the track, the OST consistently brings about amazing tunes that improve the anime and are more than worthy of a listen outside of it.<br />
<br />
As for the voice acting, the performances given are above average, demonstrating once again the high amount of execution Ore Monogatari holds. Takuya Eguchi as Takeo provides stunning voice work, achieving a voice for the overly burly man that is simultaneously gruff, strong, and caring. Megumi Han as Rinko gives cuteness in droves when she speaks, but it is her girly screams that solidify her place as the adorable Rinko. And Nobunaga Shimazaki as Suna brings calmness but also genuine laughter when appropriate.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
The romance connoisseur that I am, this anime was right up my alley from the get-go. Watching as Takeo and Rinko fell in love, all of the smiles and laughs that they shared, and the wonderful milestones they reached as a couple made me so happy to see. The blushing, the hand holding, the genuine emotions; the more their relationship grew, the more ecstatic I became, and since their relationship progressed at a nominal pace, so did the romance and therefore my happiness.<br />
<br />
Despite the repetition being a negative, I was still happy to hear Taeko say “I love you” every single time because I knew that it was either proceeded or followed by Rinko giving the most sincere smile any person ever could, which in turn made me smile even more. This leads into Rinko’s overall adorableness. No matter what she said or what she did, she always managed to make me giggle like a little school girl. Whether she moved behind a nearby pillar at light speed when Takeo turned to look at her or she was stifling her ghosts to stop them from waking her boyfriend, Rinko made the show into the cute powerhouse that it ended up being.<br />
<br />
The show also nailed its comedy. Situations like Ai getting angry towards Oda, the doctor getting spun around so much he puked (twice), and Saijou crying her eyes out on a bench were hilarious to see unfold. Furthermore, Rinko once again does wonders, such as when she is accurate yet misleading in her description of her nighttime escapade with Takeo or when she could barely contain her excitement while holding Takeo’s new baby sister. Takeo as well, with his overreactions when seeing Rinko in her bathing suit or practicing his kissing technique with Suna. Suna, too, which is surprising given his lax behavior, but it is precisely because he more or less goes with the flow that made many of his moments so hilarious. Suna nonchalantly reacting to the stuff around him or him remembering that kissing session made him funny in his own way. From the romance to the cuteness to the comedy, the anime was a fully entertaining experience from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Ore Monogatari!! has one idea in mind: love. Its narrative focuses on this theme, its characters share this feeling between each other, and its art and its music are steeped in love, too. From top to bottom, left to right, and forward to back, love permeates throughout the anime, coming in all shapes and sizes. Love is definitely something everyone needs to experience, but until the real thing appears on a chilly October afternoon, this one will more than make do.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, exploration of love is thorough, repetition at times lessening the experience<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, wonderful art, from the backgrounds to the character designs to the minute details, sits alongside above average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Takeo’s gentleness, Rinko’s boldness, and Suna’s kindness exemplify love, both on its own and between each other<br />
<br />
Sound: Great, great OP, great ED, very nice OST, above average VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, romance galore, combined with so much adorableness and laughs, created a ride that never stopped being fun<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    When I first saw this anime&#039;s synopsis, I thought, &quot;Wow that&#039;s new (sorta), the side character is finally getting some spot light.&quot; Ore Monogatari certainly has been a unique experience, with a steady combination of good and bad.<br />
<br />
Story (6):<br />
The other reviews gave pretty much an accurate description on the story. Having made a point to mainly stick with rom-coms, I can confidentially say that this story is pretty much like the others. It does not introduce any new elements, but it does use make decent use of the clichés. Since this story is mainly about the relationship between the main characters, actual plot includes a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199508">
        slice-of-life standpoint, not necessarily bad, but can get repetitive if you have seen it before.<br />
<br />
Art (7):<br />
The art played a huge role in both the comedy aspect, as well as, bring the show a unique feel to it. Personally, the different faces that Takieo made when talking about Yamato (more so about the &quot;I Love You&quot; line in every episode) probably saved me from dropping, and then repeatedly stepping on the lack of word choice the show offered. The art itself was vibrant, which matched the mood of the show.<br />
<br />
Sound (6):<br />
The OST, regardless of the genre, is crucial when attempting to develop a mood the creators wants the viewers to feel. While the OST slightly added to the mood, it did not really help set it, nor is it a &quot;stand-alone&quot; piece one can listen to. The OP and ED were well suited to every episode, but not really memorable.<br />
<br />
Characters (7):<br />
Rom-coms rely on two things to be successful, unique characters that have a good amount of emotional depth, and the interaction between said characters. While the two main characters (Takieo and Yamato) had a very good development phase, I feel that the side characters were more there for plot progression and nothing more. There was little to no progression on the &quot;main&quot; side character Suna, even though he had just as much screen time than the real two main characters. The other sides were either there for filler, or lasted 3-4 episodes to introduce a new element to Takieo&#039;s and Yamato&#039;s relationship. That being said, the interaction between the characters were more or less fantastic. The comedy between them would have me laughing so hard that I would have to pause to calm down a bit.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8):<br />
The anime meshed with itself rather well, which provided a good comedy with a romance underplot. Any fans of rom-coms, I would recommend picking this up, as it provides a nice light and airy atmosphere, hard found in most anime. If this anime were a food, it would be a waffle. It looks interesting with all the toppings on it, which some tasted well together, while others didn&#039;t, but when you finished, you were full and satisfied.<br />
<br />
Overall (7):<br />
This anime seemed to waste time adding characters to further plot devices, rather than adding depth to the characters already there. But with the variety of characters, you got to see how interesting it was for the male lead to interact with a seemingly everyday life.

    Do you want absurd comedy? Check! Do you want heartwarming romance? Check? Do you want each episode to make you feel wholesome? Check! Even though this was a shoujo manga adaptation, I thoroughly enjoyed Ore Monogatari, all 24 episodes. My favorite anime are the kind that show multiple characters&#039; perspectives rather than just the main character. But man, is this main character good! Takeo and his entire family seem to represent the epitome of the Japanese ideal of &quot;Wa&quot;, or &quot;harmony&quot; with oneself, one&#039;s neighbors, and with nature. Takeo strives to be selfless in every way, is a peak athlete, and never hesitates to tell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354177">
        people how he feels or the help out others. <br />
<br />
Along for the ride are his best friend Sunakawa who is always there for him with unconditional support, the girl he likes who enjoys making cakes and enjoying life, and the motley crew of classmates, both male and female, who support these main characters. Character and enjoyment are 10/10 for me.

    &quot;Love from the first sight&quot;<br />
is mostly all what this series is about, if you&#039;re looking for an anime that is enjoyable,fun and barely have any development in the story then you will enjoy this.<br />
<br />
one of the weakest point in this anime is focusing way too much on the main characters,which couple of shoujo animes do BUT in this series do not expect any plot twist or any kind of surprise, everything is too predictable,although it&#039;s still fun to watch.<br />
<br />
the story pace was too slow at some points it&#039;s getting kinda dull and too sugary with the &quot;lovey dovey&quot; couple . tho it has pretty likable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205074">
        and relatable characters so it kinda balanced the weakness of the story.<br />
<br />
This Anime art is way beyond awesome,I really enjoyed every scene of it! :)

    You’re a kid, you’re a squid, you’re a kid- Oh wrong series - My Love Story review<br />
<br />
One of My Love Story’s strongest elements is how well crafted and executed the story and characters are, regardless of the supposed cliches and many nitpicks I’ve seen in reviews for this show. Its cheese lies subtly in its favor. We’re introduced to a cast that each have their own unique characters to them, while nothing innovating, it all interconnects their relationship and development in a heartfelt way. From the reviews I’ve read, it’s mostly underdeveloped short introductions rather than an actual review. And highly lacks any depth or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199389">
        analysis to convey an overall legitimate point. Mini rant over, onto the review.<br />
<br />
My Love Story begins when our main protagonist, Gouda Takeo saves the Yamato Rinko from a groper on a train. Thus ushering the flattering romantic comedy. The show is mostly an episodic series that touches on moments for us to understand and appreciate the relationship between Takeo and Sunakawa, and Takeo’s bond with Yamato. In the beginning we are given a touching analogy of two ogre friends that conveys the bromance and challenges Takeo faces on a daily basis. Sunakawa is a friend that always has his friend’s back and accumulates his advice from simply watching people throughout his childhood, understanding the psychology behind people’s action in order to help his thick headed friend, Takeo. This is prominent throughout the show and shows that more to a book than its cover. In each episode we learn about our main character and how he became the person he is, how he reflects himself not because of others, but because of the actions he takes. I didn’t find comedy superbly funny but it makes the moments much more sweeter, creating and immersing conclusive endings to a conflict. There are plentiful of visceral moments that bile up heart wrenching excitement to portray Takeo in a positive manner and gain respect from people who wouldn’t have or didn’t otherwise.<br />
<br />
Art and animation are pretty good. There were times when I noticed some slightly odd and derpy drawings, specifically of characters in far shots. Sunakawa just looked awful. There are more stagnate moments than action sequences so you shouldn’t expect much from the animation department, not to downplay it, it is good, just not Fate Stay Night Unlimited Budget level. Onto sound, again, it’s not at all amazing or WOW! like Tokyo Ghoul’s epic soundtrack that it doesn’t earn because the anime fails to tell a complete narrative. Or even Wolf’s Rain, another anime that I’m a bit mixed if it even earns such a FANTASTIC soundtrack for an above average show. I digress, anyhow, I still noticed it enough to convey the cute moments and intimate scenes. The opening was okay to me; it fits well with the anime. The ending on the other hand, I thought brought in a vibe of friendship that you’ll have only between a few friends. The love and caress of those who truly respect and love you. Voice acting did a nice job in consistency with the character design and really matched with the characters. Overall, sound does good job integrating in the show.<br />
<br />
Characters can be easily summed up as cliche and generic, but what does that even mean if you just took it out of its context just to bitch about it. Gouda Takeo is your gorilla sized man with a huge heart. He has this charisma and hint of calmness to him that exasperates a gentle soul. Even as a nice person as he is, there are people that talk behind his back because of his appearance. Takeo can be simply stated to be a character putting up a front or some other wacky nit pick, but in what we’re shown, there’s no point in him getting mad or lose esteem. He is well aware of his surroundings and doesn’t let small talk affect him. Takeo’s bromance with Sunakawa has got to be one of the best I’ve seen since Free!. Sunakawa is an awesome supporting character to Takeo. He is always on the sideline watching and observing people in order to understand the situation and then giving his thought and solution. He’s the friend that will always have your back. His reasoning for not dating any girls or liking is the fact that he don’t like no hoes talking shit about his friend behind his back. Bruh, that’s just cool. His calm and understanding nature assists in good balance to Takeo’s thick headedness and even Yamato’s ignorance. Ah, Yamato, of all the squeaky characters I’ve been killed until deaf ears, I surprisingly and pleasantly found her to be quite a joy. Not one moment did I find her annoying because of how well her character is in relations to Takeo and Yamato, as well as how cheesy she is with her friends. It’s moments like these that even the stuff I hate the most, I can love. Yamato is the pillar to Takeo’s character change and the flaws within him. She is able to bring out the ‘real’ human inside of him. From there, we see him do and say things he normally wouldn’t say such as the whole issue with the patisserie dude, Ichinose, of which he found himself to be fine even if Yamato ever left him for someone else. Though we already know no character is without flaw, this shows Takeo’s true nature, that he can feel stress, doubt, and pain for someone so optimistic as him.<br />
<br />
 There are some criticisms that I have to say, though nothing major enough that it’ll deflect the score of the show. The last two episodes with Ichinose, while I thought it showed the human side of Takeo, it was a bit too underwhelming in impact as a narrative and it felt a little rush to me. But it still concluded good enough to show what they wanted to show. The whole situation with Yukika Amami I thought showed good development for her and Sunakawa but it felt like Snafu with the whole uncertainty, no answer situation. I don’t know. I feel like I just had to complain somehow. <br />
<br />
My Love Story manages to efficiently utilize simple character traits and offer a new perspective of the romantic comedy genre. The character relationships are open and gives us answers to situations between characters most other shows bother to drag out for long durations. Or never to hear at all. That is why this show earns a 8/10, and just misses the benchmark for my badass seal of approval. But it is a show that I can recommend to anyone who isn’t a diehard shoujo fan because apparently they are the experts in nitpicking the basic traits but never explaining in context of the story and overall narrative, why exactly? Did you enjoy this review? Hit me up on MAL comment section, Twitter, or Deviantart and I’ll go rest now because I’m burnt out in writing two massive reviews in one night.
