    Overview:<br />
<br />
Nearly every review of JoJo 2012 praises it as a MASTERPIECE, because it represents a triumphant return for the macho manly anime of the past. I have a slightly different perspective than most critics on MAL, so unsurprisingly my conclusion was a little different as well. If I was born between 1995 and 2000 and grew up during the &quot;sparkling kawaii desu moe&quot; era of anime where every male protagonist is a whiny pussy, I too would be inclined to give Jojo a 10/10 out of sheer novelty alone. However, I was born in the 1980s and I actually remember the GAR days of manly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183302">
        anime. In the 1990s, you watched anime largely by going to the video store and renting whatever anime was available. Almost ALL of it was cheaply licensed, ultraviolent OVAs from the late 80s and early 90s. Were those anime better? Well believe it or not...no, not really. There were indeed some awesome anime like Fist of the North Star (Hokuto no Ken), but for every Fist of the North Star there was absolute garbage like: Genocyber, Violence Jack, MD Geist, Mad Bull 34, Angel Cop, etc. Simply being macho didn&#039;t make an anime good by default back in the 1990s, and that shouldn&#039;t be any different today! I am going to look at Jojo from a fair and objective view rather then simply heap praise on it based on principle alone.<br />
<br />
Story and Characters: 6/10 <br />
<br />
(SPOILERS!)<br />
<br />
The 2012 JoJo anime adapts the first 2 arcs of the manga, so this is the JoJo series you should watch first sequentially! JoJo is about the Joestar family and their epic feats of badassery over the generations. The first generation of Joestar asskicking takes place in Victorian England with Jonathan Joestar, whom I will call Johnny JoJo. The dumbass father of Johnny JoJo decides to adopt the blatantly evil son of a man who &quot;saved his life&quot; when he had a carriage accident. Even though it is later revealed that papa Joestar knew that Brando was a dishonest man and wasn&#039;t actually trying to save him, he adopts Dio anyway and continuously believes Dio over his own son despite the fact that Dio may as well have &quot;evil&quot; tattooed on his forehead. Dio is a 1 dimensional bully who exists to make Johnny JoJo miserable, steal his father&#039;s affection, and ultimately try steal his inheritance. Dio will perform some act of over the top evil like brutally murder Johnny&#039;s dog, and papa Joestar will instantly believe Dio&#039;s side of the story, simply to frustrate the viewers. This is like that Spongebob episode where Spongebob adopts an evil lamprey as a pet and keeps blaming the obviously innocent Gary the snail whenever anything goes wrong. The difference is that JoJo isn&#039;t a comedy cartoon for small children. It is a Shonen demographic anime that actually expects us to take this seriously! Johnny JoJo discovers that Dio is attempting to poison his father and inherit the fortune, so he goes to find the poison shop where Dio has been purchasing his product. Johnny JoJo proves Dio is guilty, but Dio uses a mystical artifact Johnny has been studying to transform himself into a vampire and start wrecking shit. Dio kills papa Joestar and seemingly gets killed in turn by Johnny, but it turns out Dio survived and wants to create a vampire army to take over the world. Johnny takes some mystical martial arts training to unleash sunlight with punches (just go with it) and goes on a crusade to take out Dio. Unfortunately, that son of a bitch simply won&#039;t stay down and eventually Johnny must sacrifice his own life in manly fashion to save his wife and unborn child.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to come right out and say it, Dio is a SHIT excuse for a villain. There are many things that can make a great villain: complex motivations, based on a historical figure, or even being extremely evil in an interesting fashion that is fun and frightening to watch. Dio is a cliche bully archetype that gets turned into a vampire, then decides to take over the world because he wasn&#039;t already cliche enough. In a way, Dio does remind me of the villains from oldschool GAR anime like: the bullies in Genocyber that randomly decide to rape a homeless child, or the bully in Devilman who decides to butcher the class bunnies for no reason. However, those bullies were quickly and brutally dispatched because that kind of character isn&#039;t very interesting. They exist to piss off the audience and grant a cathartic revenge fantasy when they get killed. Dio just lingers on and on like a sulfurous fart that won&#039;t go away. Johnny JoJo is a gentlemen and a badass, but his character depth never goes beyond that. He doesn&#039;t have a strong internal struggle or ambiguous goals or anything that makes complex character. I know that isn&#039;t the point of JoJo, but a show aimed at older audiences should probably try to have SOME level of complexity unless the action is so awesome it doesn&#039;t matter. However, JoJo isn&#039;t a non-step action violence fest like Hellsing Ultimate. JoJo actually does take a LOT of time to focus on plot and characters, which is why it is disappointing that the plot isn&#039;t very good and the characters are paper thin archetypes.<br />
<br />
After a decent but certainly not masterful arc 1, we get to see the adventures of Johnny JoJo&#039;s grandson: Joey JoJo. Joey JoJo must go to Mexico to fight against the evil vampires that created the mystical mask from part 1. He teams up with the grandson of one his grandfather&#039;s old allies along with a surprisingly friendly Nazi dude named Rudol Von Stroheim. I guess the writer of JoJo meant to use the name &quot;Rudolph&quot; because &quot;Rudol&quot; isn&#039;t even a real German name. Rudol&#039;s catchphrase is German (insert whatever) is the best! Characters with goofy catchphrases can work like Korbowitz in Berserk or Armstrong in FMA, but I wasn&#039;t really feeling this one. Honestly I just found myself wishing this guy would be replaced with Captain Germany the manly werewolf from Hellsing. This second arc does have some pretty awesome action scenes including Joey JoJo punching the vampire leader into Outer fucking SPACE! However, the plot and characters still come WAY short of being called a masterpiece or anything approaching a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art and animation is heavily stylized and admittedly does a good job creating the look and feel of anime from yesteryear. There are lots of still-shots to recreate the look of cheap animation from the days where anime had extremely limited budgets. There are plenty of &quot;action lines&quot; that the old anime had in abundance especially pre-1990. I think my favorite part of JoJo might actually be the art because it really does recapture and recreate what anime used to look like and now no longer even resembles.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
Does JoJo do a decent job capturing what old school anime used to look and feel like? Yeah, and that is why it isn&#039;t a bad show. Does being retro make it a masterpiece by default? Absolutely not. The story may not suffer from pointless &quot;tournament arcs&quot; like so many shonen anime, but the plot isn&#039;t honestly very good. Like the characters, the plot is very simplistic and doesn&#039;t exactly carry JoJo into the realms of truly great anime. The male characters are actually manly and don&#039;t resemble either Keitaro Urashima from Love Hina or Shinji Ikari from NGE, the 2 characters that basically convinced anime executives that Otaku identify more with Beta males and completely neutered anime. However, JoJo&#039;s mediocre action and old school animation doesn&#039;t quite make up for its simplistic and overall  lackluster story and characters. At the end of the day, JoJo 2012 is a good anime, but is JUST a good anime. It doesn&#039;t nearly deserve the ratings it has received on MAL, or the praise it receives on 4chan. I WOULD recommend it to younger viewers who want to see what old anime was like, but I caution against the kind of blind praise that has already made this anime absurdly overrated.<br />

    This is my favorite series ever, and it finally got a real weekly anime adaptation after 25 years—the ‘94 and ‘00 OVAs and the Phantom Blood movie, which never saw DVD/home video release do not count—there is definitely some bias in this review. That said, there’s a reason I still didn’t give it a perfect score, and it’s because I’m still trying to keep a hint of objectivity in here.<br />
<br />
Art - 8/10<br />
<br />
I suppose I’ll start off with how it adapted the source material. Unlike the OVAs and Phantom Blood movie, there were no cuts in content, and it actually adapted parts 1 and 2 of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92869">
        the manga: Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. The studio, David Production, did what I would consider a masterful job in terms of bringing out Araki Hirohiko’s style into the manga. He is an artist, and you can see his art evolve throughout the long-running JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure franchise. DP hired multiple art directors and tried to incorporate the different faces and builds in body throughout the series. Also, because there is no such thing as “canon” colors for characters, DP, in an unexpected but very innovative manner, used their poor budget to their advantage—by changing color schemes and using colorful abstract backgrounds during monologues and still-frames. I’ll give the art by itself a 10/10, even though sometimes Jonathan and Joseph, the titular JoJos in this series, suffer from Gorilla Face Syndrome, since the BD/DVDs are doing a great job of fixing it.<br />
<br />
On still-frames, this is one of TWO flaws I found throughout the whole series. DP was contracted by Warner Bros. and they were given a pretty weak budget to work with. As a result, some might say that there are lots of times where this show is more of a “live-manga” or stream of the manga. The “animated” SFX from the source material, plentiful still-frames, and lack of actual animation at times are what add to this idea. Don’t get me wrong though, it’s not like every episode is a slideshow; however, there are DEFINITELY times when it feels that way—I’m looking at you, episode 16. Honestly, I feel like DP made it up to us with some episodes that were battle-heavy, like episode 20 and most definitely the final 3 or so episodes. Especially the last one. For this I will have to give the animation itself a 7/10. The distinct art style and use of colors  boost it up to an 8 for me.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
<br />
So-no Chi no Sa-da-me, JOOOOOOOOO~JO! There are two opening themes, JOJO~Sono Chi no Sadame~ by Hiroaki “TOMMY” Tominaga , and BLOODY STREAM by Coda. Both were tailored for their respective Part in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, in both lyrics, atmosphere, and animation itself—we actually get some pretty good CG depicting events in Parts 1 and 2. They were extremely catchy, and I never skipped them. The ending theme was Roundabout by progressive rock band YES, which actually came out in the 70s—and influenced the original manga! and I applaud DP for that choice. The song’s lyrics fit extremely well and it is actually one of Araki Hirohiko’s favorite bands! Also, because it is an 8 minute song, they used different snippets, some soft, some more intense, depending on what kind of note the episode ended on. That was genius and definitely made the watching experience better. If it were up to the OP and ED alone I&#039;d give the sound a 10/10 <br />
<br />
As for the actual soundtrack, because of the difference in atmosphere between Parts 1 and 2, or at least I assume it’s for that reason, DP hired two composers and gave us two soundtracks per part. Phantom Blood was mostly orchestral, very fitting with the late Victorian feel we get when we think of England in the 1880s. It fit extremely well and I applaud Matsuo Hayato for his beautiful soundtrack. Part 2, being much more dynamic and quite literally “all over the place”, has Iwasaki Taku, who worked with his friends Lotus Juice. The soundtrack he made has soft, orchestral pieces and, well, everything. He has rap/hip-hop, rock, metal, DUBSTEP, and even flutes and drums that bring a middle-eastern feel. Personally, I thought the dubstep was actually very good and tamer than most, and that it fit well the middle-eastern sounds he composed for with the Pillar Men, the main antagonists of Part 2. The sound direction, however, was not as amazing. Iwasaki Taku complained himself, over Twitter, that his songs were not being used correctly, and, after paying close attention to episodes 22 and 23, I can’t say I disagree. David Productions flubbed it when it came to transitioning the music and providing an appropriate atmosphere with the songs in those two episodes. For that reason, although the music itself was superb, I will have to give it an 8 total.<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
<br />
Story is pretty simple, to say the least. The original story came out in 1987, in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump. Phantom Blood can be pretty much summed up as Castlevania with Hokuto no Ken elements, which shouldn’t be seen as bad in any way. Araki Hirohiko wanted to make a solid base so that he could evolve his work throughout time, and I think he did a pretty good job, taking in the work of contemporaries around him. The first part is hot-blooded, fast-paced, and the definition of “camp”. Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando are probably the most one-dimensional characters you will ever find, but it is because they were so static, they polarized each other and made the fight between them so interesting. Dio Part 1&#039;s main antagonist, from the first episode, is depicted to us as the very definition of EVIL at the age of 12! Although the story is simple, the characters are definitely what make the sure. In Battle Tendency, the story takes a more adventurous route and we see our new JoJo, Joseph Joestar, go from New York, to Mexico, to Italy, to Sweden, and it’s amazing. The main antagonists of this part are a powerful trio of “Pillar Men” called Wham, ACDC, and Cars, responsible for the creation of the stone mask that set the events in Part 1. The continuity is great and you definitely feel time passing as you watch the series, characters like Speedwagon and Erina are shown old, and with every major timeskip you see differences in character design. Story, when it boils down to it, just has to be interesting. I was definitely interested in the stories for Parts 1 and 2 of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. They were simple, straight, and to the point, which made it possible to expand more on the character dynamics, arguably the strongest part of this series. There were no long and obnoxious training arcs, the fights are NOT dragged out—probably the most common flaw in shonen battle series—and if there are cliches, they are exaggerated to their extremes. This series does not take itself that seriously, and when it does, you can bet that you’ll be on the edge of your seat. Story gets a 9/10 from me.<br />
<br />
Character - 10/10<br />
<br />
As for the characters. Araki sure knows how to get you attached to characters. And then rip them away from you. There are definitely deaths in this series and they are dramatic and will definitely tug at your heart. Also, the voice actors are passionate and work admirably together. Takehito Koyasu, with his smooth, deep voice will send chills down your spine whenever Dio is formulating a plot or mocking JoJo. Okitsu Kazuyuki may be a newbie, unlike the slew of veterans in the rest of the cast, but he makes Jonathan Joestar so damn LIKABLE with his passionate screams, calm reassurance, and definitely makes the heart of gold in this character shine brightly. Sugita Tomokazu, probably best known for his characteristic shonen gag voice as Gintoki (Gintama) and serious/apathetic voice as Kyon (Haruhi Suzumiya series), makes a perfect Joseph Joestar, because Joseph embodies the ideal shonen protagonist—smart, strong, funny, and extremely expressive. Basically, where the animation fell short, I believe that the voice actors definitely picked up the slack. Everyone has fun, because this is supposed to be a fun series. I love it. Characters get 5/5 from me. Both as they were written and how they were acted, you can definitely feel the chemistry between all the voices and that made it way more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. I keep on mentioning this when I score each aspect of the show for this review. Ultimately, when you watch an anime, or any show, movie, etc; you do so because you want to enjoy and be entertained. I can almost guarantee that if you go and watch this show with a blank slate and just a pure, unadulterated desire to be entertained, you will not come out disappointed. Just keep in mind that JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is a series that is 25 years in the making, and this is but the beginning. It is without a doubt my favorite manga series, and this long-awaited anime adaption gives it the justice that it deserves. If you watch it, and enjoy it, like I said you probably will, then I implore to take up the manga. You can skip right to Part 3, the most popular arc in the franchise, but I recommend reading from the beginning, you’ll pick out some tiny things left out that couldn’t be conveyed through the anime, and you’ll see the evolution of Araki Hirohiko’s art throughout the ages.<br />
<br />
But first, if you watch the anime, I recommend Muda Muda Muda Subs  [MMM] subs or CommieSubs [Commie]. They are the most accurate subs and if you prefer a better script, go with MMM, if you want better typesetting and subtitled SFX, go with Commie. Personally, I used MMM because they are a group that got together solely for this series, released in a timely schedule with accurate subs, took advice/criticism well, and also have better encoding. <br />
<br />
I hope that after this review some of you watch this show and develop the same love I have for it!

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is quite possibly the most popular anime on the internet right now, what was once a weird niche show in the west has essentially become the new Naruto, which is ironic seeing as it predates it. Now what do I mean by that? Well tell me if you&#039;ve heard this one before, a mediocre shounen anime that&#039;s mostly popular with teenage boys, that has also infested meme culture, and has become almost impossible to criticize, not because it&#039;s a flawless masterpiece with absolutely no flaws that has changed society for the better (though the fans would want  you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314047">
        to believe that), but because its fans will attack you if you so much as say it isn&#039;t the magnum opus the make it out to be. Now seeing as the Part 5 anime has come to an end, I&#039;ve decided to review the first season, and tell you why I personally don&#039;t think it&#039;s anywhere near as good as people say it is.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The problem with reviewing season 1 mostly comes down to the fact that it combines two arcs with completely different settings, tones, plot, and characters, so I&#039;ll be giving each Part its own score in each category (with the exception of art and sound, both parts have the same art direction, animation and music)<br />
<br />
Phantom Blood: 3/10<br />
<br />
Think of the most generic good vs evil story, think of a story with a boring as hell flawless main character who&#039;s so righteous and good that his only mistake was being too nice (yes really), a bland and inhuman villain who&#039;s just evil for the sake of being evil and who&#039;s sole motivation for being evil is literally &quot;my dad was mean to me&quot;, the most basic and overused 3 act structure, and a supporting cast so cookie cutter and forgettable, that you could switch some of their roles and round without anything changing. That&#039;s Part 1 in a nutshell<br />
<br />
To be fair, the first 3 episodes are well paced, the story at first is a generic macguffin story, but it knows how to hold your interest and be suspenseful, then just devolves into Generic Shounen Battle Show Inspired By Fist of The North Star/Dragon Ball #50. It&#039;s quite hard for me to talk about themes, character development or anything because it&#039;s such a nothing story, no one develops (I mean Jonathan gets stronger but in terms of personality he&#039;s the same), the only theme is, I guess, &quot;good will triumph over evil&quot; or some generic bullshit like that, if Jojo had ended hear it wouldn&#039;t even be a footnote in the history of Shounen Jump. I&#039;ll go more in depth on why I think Phantom Blood sucks in the character section.<br />
<br />
Battle Tendency: 6/10<br />
<br />
Now this is much much better, not amazing but a huge improvement over part 1, and I think the main reason why is that it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously and is basically a comedy. Part 1 took itself completely seriously, and as such I had to focus on plot, characters, themes etc first and entertainment value second, with part 2 it&#039;s the opposite, I feel like the series it at its strongest when it&#039;s basically just a comedy, it makes the poor writing, bland characters and unoriginal storylines a lot more tolerable, seeing as the focus is being entertaining and fun, rather than telling a great story. <br />
<br />
The story is incredibly generic, it&#039;s yet another story where the villain is an ancient being who was sealed away long ago but has now come back, oh, and his goal is to collect a macguffin that gives him ultimate power, how original. However, again, it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously so I&#039;ll let it slide seeing as it&#039;s really entertaining, it&#039;s also paced much better than Part 1. Overall if you&#039;re looking for some mindless fun, I recommend Part 2.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Phantom Blood: 1/10<br />
<br />
A cliche story can be forgiven if the characters are interesting, unfortunately for Phantom Blood, the characters are some of the most bland and cookie cutter characters I have ever seen, period. Let&#039;&#039;s start with Jonathan, Jonathan&#039;s entire personality is that he&#039;s a hero, he has no character flaws, he&#039;s just, the hero, that&#039;s all he is, he never develops he is the same irritating nice guy from beginning to end. Then we have Speedwagon, he&#039;s a thug who tries to kill Jonathan, but then he gets punched in the face and follows Jonathan around, all he does is stand around and tell the audience what they just saw, how did this character become popular, seriously, aside from his design there is nothing noteworthy about him. There&#039;s also Erina, who might as well be a cardboard cut out of a vagina, she has no personality (noticing a trend?) and exists solely to be Jonathan&#039;s love interest. <br />
<br />
Then we move on to Dio, quite possibly the most iconic Jojo character, he&#039;s a terrible antagonist, his actions make no sense whatsoever, I mean killing his birth father made sense, he was abusive to Dio and killing him would essentially allow Dio to go from the slums to a mansion, however once he gets the chance to live a life of luxury, what does he do? He tries to kill the man who took him in, why? Because the plot demanded him to. Dio&#039;s goal is to be rich an powerful, but he&#039;s already an aristocrat, so logically he shouldn&#039;t do anything after killing Dario, if Dio just lived a normal life with the Joestars nothing bad would&#039;ve happened to him, Dio caused his own downfall for no reason at all, Dio is stupid, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
We also have Zeppeli, he&#039;s Jonathan&#039;s mentor, but not a fun or interesting one like Biscuit from HxH or Master Roshi from Dragon Ball, no, he&#039;s just a guy with, you guessed it, no personality, who teaches Jonathan how to fight and then dies like 4 episodes later, they expect you to feel sad but who&#039;s gonna feel sad for some guy who no personality who they barely knew for 4 episodes.<br />
<br />
There are some other characters in Part 1, but they aren&#039;t really noteworthy, the other Hamon masters are just there, one of them tells Jonathan something he already knew, and another fights Joseph in Part 2. There&#039;s also this one kid who tags along Jonathan for 2 episodes and then disappears, I don&#039;t know why he was in the story, he could easily be removed without literally anything in the story being affected.<br />
<br />
Battle Tendency: 5/10<br />
<br />
Joseph is a huge improvement over Jonathan, in that he actually has a unique personality, he&#039;s an goofy asshole who&#039;s a lot more tactical than Jonathan, he&#039;s not too interesting, but he is really fun to watch, so for an arc that focuses more on comedy, I think he&#039;s a good protagonist, he even develops a little, he&#039;s much less obnoxious and rude at the end, which I know doesn&#039;t seem impressive at all, but trust me, he&#039;s one of the only characters in the entire franchise who actually develops.<br />
<br />
My favorite character of the arc, and this season as a whole, is Stroheim, there&#039;s not a whole lot to him, he&#039;s just really over the top and fun to watch, any scene with him is really entertaining it&#039;s also interesting to see a soldier of the most cruel regime to date as something other than a complete monster, Stroheim is a proud and loyal soldier serving the country he believed in, even if that country was one of the only objective bad guys in real world history.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;ve bad praising the characters in Part 2 so far, so why did I give them a 5/10 overall? Well the rest of the characters (besides the villains) are about as bland as the ones from Part 1, we have Smokey, a boy who Joseph saves at the beginning of the arc, he&#039;s set up to be Joseph&#039;s sidekick but is quickly dropped, like the boy from Part 1. Then we have Caesar, another character who&#039;s popularity baffles me, he is pointless, he trains with Joseph and is set up as his sidekick for the confrontation with the pillar men and is quickly killed off, having achieved nothing while he was alive. Lisa Lisa is about as bland as Zeppeli, she&#039;s also revealed to be Joseph&#039;s mother, there&#039;s not much else to talk about, moving on.<br />
<br />
The villains are a slight improvement over Dio, and by that I mean, they&#039;re not completely moronic and illogical, their goals and motivations are overly simplistic though, but at least they have some motivation and a concrete goal that isn&#039;t &quot;take over the world&quot;. Kars is a cunning and intelligent villain, a vast improvement over Dio, his motivations make sense, he wanted his race to overcome their weaknesses, but was forced to wipe out most of them once they tried stopping his experiments, he has nothing left but this goal to become perfect and is obsessed with it, and that&#039;s actually sort of interesting. The two other pillar men aren&#039;t nearly as interesting though, they just sort of follow Kars&#039; orders, they try to make Wammu more interesting but it doesn&#039;t really work, still a vast improvement over Dio though.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The best part is easily the animation, it&#039;s incredible, the lighting, the cinematography, the movement, the Hamon effects, all of it is great to watch, I wish this kind of animation was used on shows with better stories but i&#039;m not complaining here. Some scenes also play around with colour, and that really sets the mood for certain scenes, overall, the animation is great, the only problem is the amount of still shots in the show, otherwise I would&#039;ve given it a 9.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is also great, there are some catchy tunes, such as the Pillar Men theme, Stroheim&#039;s theme and some of the other orchestral pieces. The ops are both incredible, they&#039;re well composed, the vocals are great and they&#039;re really catchy. Same goes for the ED but it&#039;s a song from the 70s so it doesn&#039;t really count<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
I recommend just skipping to Part 2 if you want a fun action show, you&#039;re not missing much by skipping Part 1, besides he Hamon explanation which you could just easily look up online. Personally I&#039;m baffled this show became so popular, it starts off badly and just isn&#039;t anything that special.

    The keyword &quot;Bizarre&quot; in it&#039;s title is more then appropriate.<br />
<br />
And considering the many details the show has it&#039;s difficult to find a point to start talking about it to explain everything, but I&#039;m going to give an attempt.<br />
<br />
The First thing to address is probably the story and the storytelling of JoJo.<br />
where it basically does everything wrong in such a way that it becomes hysterical to watch and not to mention the big layer of 80&#039;s cheese that covers it all.<br />
<br />
JoJo tells it&#039;s story through the worst way possible &quot;exposition&quot;. and not just a little bit. The characters will explain literally EVERYTHING that is happening in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190484">
        front of you, and it&#039;s not just done in your typical anime fashion. No, Every Character will explain things as if they are pooping out the biggest turd of their life that was been clogging their bowels for weeks. making it hysterical to hear them do so. Jojo&#039;s story itself is very simplistic in each arc. protagonist faces an evil that is bent on world domination. and that&#039;s about it. however This is the first series I&#039;ve ever seen that has multiple shifting protagonists. without spoiling to much, I can say that each story arc headlines the offspring of the previous protagonist. which keeps the show very fresh, because of the shift in characters.<br />
<br />
Moving on the the art and animation. <br />
One of the things I absolutely loathe is talking during battle scene&#039;s.<br />
(Looking at you Bleach!)<br />
because it kills the pacing and tension of the combat. As I explained above Jojo likes to explain A LOT but they manage to keep the pace up despite lengthy dialogues and maintain intense visuals to keep you on your toes during the fights. The visuals are very clean, sharp, and use some very unique color pallets to address dire situations. suddenly placing characters in a complete green pallet against a dark/pink background.<br />
The animation to be fair is very limited and makes use of clever tricks to make a &quot;less is more&quot; kind of effect. flashy backgrounds, shaky cam, etc. which works very well for shows like this to maintain the high detail of characters, yet it makes the fights less dynamic.<br />
<br />
The Music is phenomenal, very catchy and colorful, which matches the overall feel for the show. and a lot of different styles come to play, jazz, rock, even dub step. And choosing Roundabout by Yes as a title track!? is to me a strange choice but it works.<br />
<br />
To be fair the Characters in the show come across rather weak.<br />
As I mentioned earlier, because of the shifting protagonists we&#039;re also time skipping every arc. which only allows 1 or 2 characters from the previous arc to reappear. this makes it very hard to latch on to a character because the time spent with them is so limited. and the expositional nature of the series also pushes you away from a character. we are not allowed to get under their skin and get a chance to feel like they feel. because they will address their emotions the moment they bother them.<br />
This is probably why the protagonist of the sequel, (Stardust Crusaders) Jotaro is one of the most popular protagonists of this series. because he hardly talks at all, he&#039;s mysterious, silent, you don&#039;t know everything about him and that is what makes you curious about a character. <br />
<br />
However, in overall the show was still an enjoyable ride, the combat scene&#039;s are every enjoyable and varied, the character designs are incredibly flamboyant and unique. it&#039;s all around 80&#039;s cheesy fun. that deserves a decent 7. <br />

    First, a premise: I am NOT a Jojo fan from any previous series, nor I ever read the manga. When I approached this new anime, I did it only out of advice from an online friend, knowing that Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure was... kind of a milestone and a very famous manga? Really, that&#039;s it. I had no idea what was expecting me. Which actually made it all the more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Now, TO THE REVIEWMOBILE!<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The story so far, if not complex or especially well written, is fun, thrilling, and chock-full of action and awesomeness. The first impression I got from Jojo&#039;s Bizzare Adventure was that this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76859">
        was going to be a completely over-the-top experience. No subtle psychological games here. This is all about big brawny men facing each other in large-hamming contests not less grand than their mano-a-mano fights. The premise quickly gets so outrageous that it can only be fun - as long as it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, which luckily is not a mistake this adaptation makes. To sum it up, this is the kind of plot that I could expect Charles Dickens to write after he got stoned on some heavy stuff and watched Hokuto no Ken, Hellsing and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, AT THE SAME TIME. Make of that whatever you want to.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
The art is nothing short of awesome to me. The colour are straight out of some hippie&#039;s acid trip. It&#039;s a compliment, actually! They&#039;re gorgeous and out of this world, giving an unreal feeling to the entire anime. The graphic representation of sounds makes this anime into some sort of moving comic. The animation in itself is not extra smooth, but I feel like this is not really important here. The only thing that really annoys me is the censorship, but that&#039;s not the animators&#039; fault. The OP, on the other hand, must be the most amazing one in YEARS.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Forget the soundtrack, which is still excellent. When you have a great rock song like &quot;Roundabout&quot; (by English band YES, no less) for an anime&#039;s ED, you know you&#039;re dealing with people who has real taste. The song wins the prize for best anime OST this year alone, hands down.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
This is where the fun really lies. Jojo is a World of Ham where every. Single. Character. Is out there to chew the scenery in unbelievable ways. The villain is the most... villainous I&#039;ve seen as of late. Even secondary characters pull off outrageous, ludicrous stunts, both in action scenes but more often in dialogues. Everyone will just scream all the time in the most hot-blooded possible way. It sounds ludicrous? It is. But it&#039;s so exaggerated that it works perfectly! Again, the magic element is that the anime doesn&#039;t take itself seriously. It&#039;s aware of the ridiculous levels of testosterone that are flying around and does nothing to tone them down, with everyone screaming at the top of their lungs in an almost Kamina-esque way. As a result, all main characters and a good deal of the secondary ones pass through as a single troupe of uncomparable badasses; and whenever someone loses a fight, it&#039;s only because someone managed to top his badassery with EVEN MORE badassery. And Dio Brando, is the most badass of them all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t give less than a 10 to the enjoyment of this series. To me, every episode is 25 minutes of hysterical, orgasmic fun. It just boils down to that: if you like people acting outrageously, exaggerate exclamations, fights to the last broken bone and the last drop of blood, martial arts and supernatural powers in an unlikely setting, all finely crafted and delivered in an ultra-dense form, this anime is for you. If you don&#039;t, well, why do you watch anime?<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
A must watch, and possibly the best show of this season!

    It&#039;s time to take a trip back to the 1800s, an age of time when the Napoleonic era and the rise of many colonies took place among various empires. History isn&#039;t easy to trace with certain origins but Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure has its origins traced back with its original series. The fantastic journey finally begins! Yup, it&#039;s here and and this series suddenly is one hell of an anime that will not only bring some nostologia but excitement to you. Join Jojo Joestar and his many bizarre adventures as he embarges on a journey and learn about the wonders of the world.<br />

Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure (2012)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92681">
        is a reboot in the title of the same name based on a collection of manga written by Hirohiko Araki. He has also collaborated in other works but Jojo is his most famous presentation. The series picks up its way from the 19th century focused on Jojo Joestar and...his bizarre adventures as he fights equally bizarre adversaries. <br />
<br />
I have not read or seen the original series but this reboot has made a strong impression on me. The premise of the series is based the Joestar family. He is the titular character and judging by the title, the adventures are based on his experiences. To me, I consider this series to be a classic, nostalgic, and exhilarating tale. It is nostalgic because the period of time the series takes place. Think about it: the 19th century. It&#039;s a time when technology is nothing compared to what we have today. Everything is realistic, artistic, and presented in a natural form. This setup is quite lucid and easy to understand with even new viewers to anime. Hell, if I could understand it, anyone probably can.<br />
<br />
The story starts off well and immediately wastes no time getting to the drama. In fact, we are already introduced some intense rivalry between Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) and Dio. It gets to the point and doesn&#039;t push itself to make any surprises. Well, I for one was surprised by how well the series executed its starting points and made a strong impression on me.<br />
<br />
On the surface, viewers can clearly see that Jonathan Joestar (Jojo) is a nobleman with a heart of gold and cares others above his well-being. This is proved through his actions, words, and his way of helping out others. He is also seen as a tough fellow who doesn&#039;t let anyone push him around, especially Dio. This clearly sets up the rivalry between Jojo and Dio as the two seems to be on the opposite side of things. We already know that Jojo is a noble man. However, Dio is far from that as viewers can see him as a selfish, impure, and ill-mannered individual. His behavior, dialogue, and actions makes him a dangerous adversary as he not only has the physical prowess but aptitude and brilliance to match his capacity. This combination makes the rivalry that more exciting. To add onto to the drama, we also have a love interest. Unfortunately, events becomes inevitable as a seemingly potential romance is ruined by Dio. Talk about being a spoiled brat. It is quite intense to watch the drama between the duo especially when we see the clear gap between the the two. It&#039;s almost like David vs. Goliath as Jojo plays the role of the underdog.<br />
<br />
Beyond the rivalry, there also exists a mysterious object that can seemingly turn the tide. It is a mysterious mask that seems to have ancient powers. These powers manifests by the spills of blood which leads to devastating results. It&#039;s definitely fun and exciting to see how far the rivalry will take now given that lives are also at stake.<br />
<br />
The story focuses on this mysterious object and among other artifacts later on. In fact, the story itself is actually divided into two separate arcs that follows a different generations of Jojo Joestar. The first arc known as Phantom Blood details on the rivalry between the duo. The second arc marks a glorious adventure starring Joseph Joestar (a descendent from the previous storyline) along with a new friend. Together, they embark on an adventure like never before taking on adversaries, improving themselves, and learning about the world and its wonders.<br />
<br />
In terms of the story, I found both arcs presented quite well. The first arc, also known as Phantom Blood, starts off in an explosive and dramatic action detailing the intense rivalry between Jojo and Dio. On the other hand, the second arc (known as Battle Tendency) follows on a more adventurous tale in contrast to Phantom Blood. We meet the next descendent of the Jojo generation. He meets Caesar and although their relationship starts off like oil and water, over time, the duo gains mutual respect for one and the other. Unfortunately though, there is more conflict than just that as a trio of powerful antagonists are introduced in the latter half. This threat puts Jojo and Caesar in jeopardy and forces them to train themselves like never before. Ultimately, the two arcs are separate entities but are quite an entertaining watch.<br />
<br />
Now, I probably haven&#039;t touched much on the topic of this as much as I should have been but perhaps the characters of the series are the most interesting aspects that connects the show together. Jojo is the dynamic titular character of the series which follows a generation pattern. I&#039;ve already talked about the first generation but both Jonathan and Joseph Joestar shares many aspects in terms of personality. Both characters are fiercely loyal, passionate, courageous, loving, and always looks after other people&#039;s well-being above their own. Although lacking in depth initution or acumen, they both are often able to come up with strategies that catches their adversaries off on guard. In particular, it is their determination to protect what they hold dear that pushes them to be their best. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s not get too attached though because the Jojo franchise also offers many other fascinating characters from its collection. Previous characters such as Erina and Speedweagon makes their returns to provide valuable assistance. More importantly though are the new characters that really makes this show shine. We have Caesar who viewers may see as a polar opposite of Joseph Joestar. Caesar is a man that is confident, casual, and often likes to hang around the ladies. In sharp contrast, he is a man that Jojo loathes at first. Yet later on, we can see that they get along quite well and even risks lives for one and the other. On a more mature side, there is also Lisa Lisa, a deadly beauty to the eye who provides invaluable aid to Jojo and Caesar. Like most battle shounens, there are the antagonists. In the first arc, there&#039;s Dio. The second half introduces a trio of antagonists known as the Pillar Men. Their elemental powers pushes the duo of Jojo and Caesar over the edge and presents an intense challenge like they never faced before. It&#039;s also humorous to watch some of their random gags sometimes even if they are randomly peculiar; i.e. Wham&#039;s tendency to reflexively attack others when someone steps on his shadow, AC/DC&#039;s crying, and Cars&#039; passion to protect living things (other than humans of course).<br />
<br />
The action of the series is ridiculous. However, I mean &#039;ridiculous&#039; in a good way because the over exaggerated way it is being portrayed. Every attack is spoken directly with dialogue and a stamp of dynamic that is humorous, entertaining, delightful, and grabs interest to viewers. Who wants to just watch characters shouting resolves like “I&#039;m going to save you, I swear!” all the time? In this series, the characters presents their attacks in an enthralling way that stimulates attention while often making jokes about the dialogues themselves. Some of the characters&#039; names are parodies as well such as AC/DC that is based off the Australia band of the same name. Most of the male characters also are manly with their flexed biceps and strong attitudes. It contrasts some of the shows I&#039;ve seen and presented in a more old school way. The female characters in the show are also well portrayed with their maturity rather than being a stubborn, jealous, or tsundere as of many today&#039;s anime series. <br />
<br />
As for the animation, the series has a edgy way of production. The artwork might not be what people see nowadays. In fact, it&#039;s more classic, nostalgic, and holds that old 1900&#039;s style. David Production (Level E, Inu x Boku SS, Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage) handles the artwork and they did a beautifully good job in my opinion. It protrays the old 1800s well with the old school vehicles, Victorian style architectures, and some of the ancient artifacts. It&#039;s like going back in time and relieving those old school memories.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series is also well performed. The first and second OP songs are very well orchestrated that is classic to the ears. Hell, I could set &quot;BLOODY STREAM&quot; by Coda on repeat all night long. It&#039;s not only entertaining to watch but also artistic with those manly poses from the main characters. Its definite old school theme sticks well is adapted. Likely wise, the ED song produces a similar feeling of that nostologia of the 1800&#039;s where adventures and collecting treasures are a source of many people&#039;s inspirations.<br />
<br />
Overall, this series gets a score of “9” from me. It has gar characters, that old school feeling, and very entertaining dialogues. It doesn&#039;t force itself either because all of them are spoken with humor as opposed for a purpose. The characters are appealing with their personalities and their interactions. From what I see, they are natural and falls in the case of a glorious presentation. The nostalgic music and artwork also gives fresh breath of cool air. No random fan service, no confusing plot twists, no cheap humor, no regrets. This series is definitely one hell of an adventure and worth your time.

    WARNING: MOST WILL NOT AGREE WITH ME. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A BABY BECAUSE I DON&#039;T SHARE YOUR OPINION, DON&#039;T READ.<br />
<br />
Life occasionally gives you things that you don&#039;t understand. Sometimes its people, or school work, and sometimes, its why something is popular. Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure was recommended to me by so many people who regarded it as one of the best series ever. Upon watching it, I realized that to enjoy the show, you must turn your brain off and just take it in. As such, I did, yet I still ask the question: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SERIES SO POPULAR!!!????????? That&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217804">
        an exaggeration of course, as I do understand the appeal of a show like this, but it certainly does baffle me to know that this show has so many deeply devoted fans who consider it their favorite anime. In my honest opinion, Jojo is one of the worst series I have ever seen so far, and I promise this isn&#039;t a troll and I know that I am in a minority.  Usually, I am a completionist who must finish every series I watch all the way through. I just couldn&#039;t do that with this one, and its the first series I ever dropped. Personally, I found every scenario really stupid, with dumb characters, and surprisingly good music. I&#039;ll do my best to explain why I hate this series so much and though I know most will disagree with me, at least try to understand where I am coming from. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation- My god does this anime look like shit. I get what they were going for: a very stylized, comic book style art style. I don&#039;t have a problem with that, and I feel that it could have added to the story. However, it just looks so unpolished. I give points for the interesting style and occasionally decent animation, but the art makes this anime look like it&#039;s from the early 2000&#039;s. Hell, I saw footage of the 1993 adaptation of Jojo and at some parts, it barely looks better. I will also say that character designs are very uninspired and I found many of them to look remarkably similar, but with some different colors on them. Overall, the art was pretty bad on this one, and the solid animation doesn&#039;t make up for it. <br />
<br />
Story- Art style doesn&#039;t prevent a story from being good. Like I said, I figured out to watch this show with my critical brain turned off, but here is what I noticed even without it. First, SO MANY PLOT CONVENIENCES!!! Occasionally they are fine, but I found most of the show&#039;s scenarios were that there was an item in the exact right place at the exact right time, or that a character was holding something that was never shown or alluded to. One of the worst examples was when fighting a monster weak to sunlight in part 2. Once the monster was lured outside, it just so happened to be exactly noon, and there was a well in the exact spot where the sun was shining brightest, which was used to reflect light to the monster on both sides. Even with no critical mind, I noticed that and it bothered me, and I can name plenty of other similar scenarios. Also, Part 1 was incredibly boring to me. The 7 year time skip from episode 1 to 2 was really stupid and we got no sense of what the characters involved went through. It was jarring. On top of that, scenarios that weren&#039;t plot conveniences, which were few and far between, were just too stupid to be entertaining, and too cringy to be funny. I know that they were trying to be &quot;bizarre&quot;, but they took it way to far. It wasn&#039;t even stupid funny, just stupid. The premise was somewhat interesting with the idea of a multi-generational epic, and there were a few episodes that were actually kind of entertaining, but overall, the story was just really bad in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Characters- I wish that the characters helped, but unfortunately, they don&#039;t. I&#039;ll name most of them. Jonothan Joestar was bland. The seven year time skip changed his personality totally and we got no idea of what happened during that time. He was supposed to be a gentleman, but he did some rather rude things to Dio (though he deserved them). He was supposed to be a weakling who can&#039;t win a fight, but he suddenly transformed to a monster who can win with a broken arm. All of that is just stupid, though he was entertaining sometimes. Dio was a decent villain, but only because he was so easy to hate. He had little motive, and was simply an asshole for no good reason. He also went from wanting money, to wanting to take over the world in literally one episode. I just found that jarring. Speedwagon was interesting, but my problem with him is that in less than an episode, he went from fighting Jojo, to becoming his best friend and biggest supporter. Thankfully, I was somewhat interested in his character. Zepelli was by far the most interesting character, but we didn&#039;t find out much about him at all. Joseph Joestar was mostly an annoying, arrogant brat whose presence on screen usually made me want to tear my eyes and ears out. Caesar was also annoying as fuck. Finally, Lisa Lisa was intriguing, but not enough for me to want to finish the show for her story. Overall, the characters were along a normal curve, with some being rather good, some being rather bad, and most being meh. <br />
<br />
Sound- I will however, give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack for Jojo was actually really nice. It always fit the mood and added to the scenes (as much as it could). It was mostly epic fight songs, but that works for a series like this one. Also, there were some nice atmospheric songs that added to the mystery aspects of the show. Also of note, was the second OP, as it is absolutely fantastic and one of my personal favorites. The ED theme is also great, not only for it being a giant meme, but just for being a great revival of an awesome old song. Finally, I have to admit that sound effects were pretty nice. While none of it blew me away or anything, it was definitely very good. Jojo&#039;s sound is by far its best quality. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- As I said, I am usually a completionist, so when I drop a show, that means that I really don&#039;t like it. Needless to say, I did not get much enjoyment out of this show at all. Every episode was a drag to watch, and no matter how much I would pray for something to be entertaining, it rarely ever was, even with my brain turned off. It just wasn&#039;t interesting or fun enough for me to want to finish it to the end. I honestly can&#039;t force myself to watch the next 9 episodes because that would be torture for me. I did get some enjoyment out of certain parts, which is why I can&#039;t give a 1 there, but I really don&#039;t understand why people love this show so much. <br />
<br />
Overall- I&#039;m usually a pretty generous reviewer. The fact that I score anything below a five means its really bad to me. I just can&#039;t get myself to finish this show because I can find barely any redeeming factors. With brain on or off, I don&#039;t understand how this show could have such a huge following of deeply devoted followers. It honestly baffles me. I&#039;ve probably pissed off a lot of people right now, so I won&#039;t say more because I like my life. All i&#039;ll say is that if you are reading this and haven&#039;t seen the show and are on the edge, and if you have seen my other reviews and have similar tastes, don&#039;t waste your time on this one. <br />

    This adaptation of JoJo covers Part 1: Phantom Blood &amp; Part 2:Battle Tendency. Both parts are unique 80&#039;s horror shonen filled with MANLINESS! The following will be split into two reviews per part below. The reason for this is that every JoJo part should NOT be skipped as each have their own tone. Examples include: Phantom Blood being a classical vampire hunter story while Battle Tendency feels very much like an Indiana Jones film. However, both animes are filled with stylish colors, great characters &amp; outstanding music!!<br />
<br />
PART 1: PHANTOM BLOOD (EPS 1-9)<br />
<br />
The beginning of JoJo seems a bit rough at first but manages to give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143631">
        the outline for its primary themes of the series. Taking place in the late 1880&#039;s in England, we are introduced to the Joestar family &amp; the Brando Family. The story starts to move when Dio Brando is adopted into the Joestar family as Dio is an ambitious jerk who wishes to rob the family of its fortune &amp; would resort to murder. <br />
<br />
Jonathan Joestar is our JoJo for the series whose life changes once Dio discovers the stone mask using it to make himself a vampire. The rest of the series involves Jonathan learning the Ripple martial art to battle against Dio &amp; his vampire army &amp; going on an adventure involving zombies, Jack The Ripper, martial artists, bizarre super powers, over the top dialogue &amp; manly tears.<br />
<br />
Being inspired by Fist Of The North Star &amp; possibly Bram Stroker&#039;s Dracula, Phantom Blood is a blend of manly characters &amp; horror elements making it a unique short tale. To some people, Jonathan comes off a rather too &quot;good hearted&quot;, however having experiencing Fist Of The North Star (specifically The Shin Arc chapters 1-10/episodes 1-22) the &quot;corny moments&quot; come off as very tragic to me.<br />
<br />
Part 1 feels more like a classical tale of vampire hunters especially with its location &amp; time period as we have normal humans battling against the forces of darkness. This is further aided with its music as it has the feel of an epic tale &amp; often resorts to something akin to immediate music.<br />
<br />
While the concepts of Stands &amp; its much later &quot;Bizarre&quot; quality weren&#039;t developed yet, this story almost works as a stand alone with its tragic finale giving much highlight to fans of Manly series such as Sakigake Otokojuku, Riki-Oh, Cyber Blue, Kongo Bancho &amp; Fist Of The North Star respectively. <br />
<br />
Phantom Blood may not be the best part of JoJo but serves as a teaser of what the series can become as it expresses the original themes Hirohiko Araki thought of: The struggle of humanity, the temptation of evil, the strive for perfection &amp; the importance of family. <br />
<br />
PART 2: BATTLE TENDENCY (EPS 10-26)<br />
<br />
50 years after the events of Phantom Blood, Joseph Joestar makes his debut as the grandson of Jonathan Joestar. The story begins once Straights uses the stone mask battling Joseph who then later encounters The Wermacht &amp; the series villains; The Pillar Men who created The Stone Masks of Part 1.<br />
<br />
This story continues the original message of the importance of family as history repeats itself with the descendants of The Joestars &amp; The Zeppelis having to face Aztec Vampires. Battle Tendency succeeds as a sequel as it vastly improves The Ripple technique along with having 3 major enemies this time around. Much like part 1, this sequel contains over the top dialogue, manly battles, creative abilities &amp; flourishes more into comedy while still retaining its signature horror.<br />
<br />
Joseph Joestar is vastly different from his grandfather, as he comes off as more rebellious &amp; comedic which more fans seem to like as a leading JoJo. Other differences in Part 2 is being more expressive in flamboyancy in ways serving as a contrast to the more masculine tone of part 1. This is aided by its opening &amp; villains The Pillarmen as the fabulous colors pay homage to Araki&#039;s coloring style &amp; foreshadows its future in Part 5. While it may deter to some viewers, this part does retain its masculine audience as the characters continue to carry various warrior ideologies. The tone for this series is more adventurous as it contains more locations than the 1st series as well as a bigger roster of leading characters. Aiding these characters are various theme music used in this anime as it ranges from 90&#039;s rap, upbeat pop, german lyrics, dubstep, electro, rock, classical &amp; even Italian singing. Note the anime uses mostly instrumental tracks while the OST contain lyrics within their songs.<br />
<br />
Part 2 is about breaking The Joestar family curse &amp; the passing of lineage as it displays how men learn to accept their pasts &amp; discover the value of the next generation. Most of the content in Battle Tendency is greatly appreciated due to the tragic events that occurred in part 1 as it helps the viewer see the progress of not just a family but the author&#039;s writing style. <br />
<br />
Look forward to Part 3 Stardust Crusaders as it focuses more on horror &amp; introduces its iconic STANDS creating the structure of the following parts of JoJo.

    JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure isn&#039;t just about silly glitz and glamour that some people seem to assume upon viewing. When watching it, <br />
It almost gave me that first impression, but to my curiosity and interest it became something more than just this being a generic show.<br />
<br />
It is an undeniably fun series first of all. <br />
<br />
Secondly, it is a shounen that is unique and different to a hell of a lot of shounen animes out there today that I feel bring an interesting blend of Dark comical yet a wacky and serious tone to viewing and the thing I love the most about this show is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180333">
        its able to shift really well in between those elements where other shows seemingly get lost within those transition and after just give up its own originality of what it was and what it wanted it to be in the process. <br />
<br />
Thankfully JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is a show that never loses its own identity or what its trying to be which is why its one of my favourite animes<br />
Its like to entertain in style which is why I appreciate this a lot.<br />
<br />
JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure manga is something ongoing from this point on in its entirety to the story stretching back to 1986 when other well known shows like Hokuto no ken, Dragon ball, Sakigake!! Otokojuku etc so yeah it goes back a long time to the grand daddies of the shounen genres of the past.<br />
<br />
As I give my review of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure (2012) without spoilers please be aware that this anime only covers the events of 2 timeline within the story first being<br />
Part 1 Phantom Blood containing episodes from 1 - 9 and Part 2 Battle Tendency containing episodes from 10 - 26 showing the main characters each being a member of the Joestar family in different timelines along with a different story from the manga as you see the family tree starts to keep going and going embracing a previous heritage notion from their own.<br />
<br />
Now to get a look into about the main characters<br />
<br />
we begin our focus on the life of the very first Joestar of the bloodline and of course in the story of Part 1 in the year of 1887.<br />
<br />
Johnathan Joestar: The main protagonist of part 1 hes a decent physically strong british nobleman as well being a Manly son of a gun, he is always thinking positive about those around him and is very polite, he seems like an ordinary gentleman.<br />
But he has a dark cloud looming around him in the form of his step brother Dio who turns his world upside down and for the most part are always against one another forming a rocky yet typical rivalry between the 2 that later on becomes the very battle between good versus evil where johnathan has to match his demonic and vastly cunning step brother by learning about a power source known as <br />
The ripple which allows him to use a mystical ancient martial art that mixes in naturalistic elements to combat against Dio&#039;s power <br />
and speaking of Dio..<br />
<br />
Dio Brando: The main antagonist of part 1 (as well as a my favourite character) He is not only a sinister human being at heart but also has a deep seeded hate towards his step brother Jonathan due to his social standing at the beginning of his childhood being raised by a poor Englishmen Dario Brando with a deceitful, uncaring personality who then became Dio&#039;s father after finding him in a wreckage of a carriage crash that had involve the father and mother of Jonathan. <br />
Dario raises Dio due to the circumstance that he did so only to gain profit off the joestar of some of their possessions resounding into a horrible upbringing of Dio in his childhood that grew with a passion to hate step father Dario and than later turns his attention to becoming part of the joestar family and tearing them apart from the inside.<br />
Dio is not only a constant threat to the joestar family in the series and within the manga itself but that he also later on is possessed by a strange stone mask that resides in the joestar&#039;s household that he later takes giving him deadly mysterious powers of a vampire.<br />
On top of that he has an unquenchable appetite for being ambitious and dangerous. what I like is how crafty his personality seems to be, he might seem like a stereotypical villain but he&#039;s someone I feel keeps part 1 very engaging to watch along with other characters in part 1 that also play a major key role for Johnathan Joestar and Dio Brando&#039;s progression and development.<br />
<br />
Part 2 Battle Tendency is the time skip way after the events that took place 50 years ago. The year is 1938 around the era of World War 2 we now are introduced to the other main character of the story at this time <br />
<br />
Joseph Joestar: He is the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, A very entertaining, funny and charming character to say the least, his mission becomes more similar to his grandfather where his actions take root to put a stop to the evil curse of the stone mask&#039;s own power that now has its creators resurrected to threaten all of humanity they are known as the pillar men, the 3 pillar men that go by the name of Esidisi (ACDC), Wamuu (Wham) and their Leader Cars (kars), they are pretty much the antagonists at this point of the story and are very dedicated and dangerous threat to anyone that tries to stop them which make the trio powerful villains also in their own right. <br />
<br />
The story and characters are really well done in this anime that becomes to the point where it feels so natural with a lot of the characters they have their strengths and weakness through the show as you see. <br />
<br />
And while the story and characters are engaging they are by no means picture perfect and what I mean by that is the way certain character&#039;s aspiration and motives sometimes look like they are trying too hard to amuse us the viewers, which might seem like the case or so? they either are represented just purposefully that way because the writing tries to portray the characters to be so in this manner of being either on the outrageous end of the spectrum or just trying to be forcefully entertaining in or both?  <br />
and for me with some scenarios in the anime it doesn&#039;t seem that well balanced on those terms, which might indicate some certain scenes of being unbalanced due to its stylistic nature here and there in my opinion.<br />
<br />
It could also feel like a hit or miss to others while experiencing this since at times they can be some annoying sarcasms and while I do applaud them trying to explore these facets of the characters, it kinda gives me those in between moods of &#039;&#039;should I be taking this seriously or not?&#039;&#039;<br />
<br />
When I really want to know and understand about something in the series or just to decipher what certain characters have mentioned it leaves out certain explanation for logical understanding on some of the mad stuff that are going on in this anime that you will see while watching it which might not make a lot of sense, it is kinda hard to unravel some things that happen within those moments of the show.<br />
<br />
The animation is nicely handled by the studio behind this and for the most part its pretty colourful along with the art style of MANime!!﻿ that shows it clear as day which can be said the same of the manga that it carries itself from.<br />
<br />
The sound is clearly based of western music that is heard in the Opening and the Closings and it fits brilliantly which gives me that charismatic impression that Hirohiko Araki gets from his influence on these types of music artist and scores and funny enough its even shows with the names of the characters having an inspiration from these certain music artist or other establishments.<br />
The voice acting was also dramatically over the top which adds to the theme<br />
that JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure has this in abundance of manly troupes the anime goes along with, I really loved Koyasu Takehito performance as Dio.<br />
<br />
This series is enjoyable to say the least and feels really dynamic and worth your time if you want to be entertained in some ways depending on your preference of course and for me its no secret that its one of my favourite of all time simply put it deserves an overall score of 9 out of 10.

    For veteran viewers that&#039;s been around long enough to notice it, the manly man protagonist has become something of a dying breed. A relic of anime&#039;s past that has been dwindling away year after year with no signs of slowing down. Many saw the change as a product of the times. Something that should simply be accepted as a predestined occurrence. The manly man was no longer marketable. Their role as a protagonist was brought to retirement, reduced to being a part of the growing collection of side character archetypes, stockpiled for future use as high school delinquents and muscle-bound uncles with far too much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183100">
        gusto. <br />
Sure, we&#039;ve seen a few cases of deviance with shows like Kaiji, Cromartie High School, and to a lesser degree, Gurren Lagann, but there was never truly something that represented the MANLY MAN in its purest form..., until 2012. Almost like divine providence, or an act of public backlash, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure announced its TV debut. An anime that stood as an embodiment of this dying breed, completely packaged with macho-man poses, testosterone-fueled rants, and a whole lot of physical smack-downs. GAR resurrected in all its glory!<br />
<br />
Self-aware in execution and oozing with machismo, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is an unapologetic slug-fest that marches to the beat of its own drum. It doesn&#039;t waste its time trying to pander to modern day expectations but simply demands the viewer to accept it for what it is. It&#039;s a bully to the uninitiated but a celebratory return to those still nostalgic for the beef heads of 80-90s action-hero Americana. <br />
<br />
In an industry that has become pro beta-male for over a decade, JoJo requires you to forget all common notions built up during that time period. It requires you to draw back to an era where chivalry wasn&#039;t there to simply admire your enemy but to swiftly kick their asses as well. To a time where protagonists weren&#039;t written to be afraid of a woman&#039;s touch, but fully embraced it. A time where conflict and friendships alike were solved over the neanderthal &quot;punch first, ask questions later&quot; logic; bonds formed by fists just as quickly as they end them. It&#039;s MANLY MAN shit! Stupid, illogical, exaggerated, hammy, so heterosexual that it borderlines on homoerotic..., but still AWESOME MANLY MAN SHIT! <br />
<br />
To help facilitate this testosterone-driven nonsense, we&#039;re introduced to the Joestar family.<br />
<br />
From one generation to the next, the Joestars&#039; battle against the supernatural has been a long and arduous one. The 1st arc, consisting of episode 1-9, serves as our jumping off point for this journey to come. Because this arc has been set aside to perform all the necessary world-building required for the series, it could feel slow for those expecting all the crazy fights and epic poses that the internet has turned into full-time memes at this point. And while we certainly do get a serving of that early on, the focus for these 9-episodes are far tamer than what the rest of the series would eventually come to offer. <br />
<br />
This is where we&#039;re first introduced to the Joestars and Brandos, two families with faiths intertwined by a red thread of ill-faith and bad-blood. Through a series of unfortunate events, the son of the Brando family, Dio, finds himself abducted into the Joestar family after his father dies of an unknown illness. It doesn&#039;t take long before the son of the Joestars, Jonathan, and Dio to develop a bitter rivalry; one that went from petty squabbles to a full-fledged vendetta after Dio&#039;s devilish schemes are unveiled.<br />
<br />
Through that turmoil, we are introduced to the MacGuffin that would go on to become the source of all conflict in the series, and many other follow-up installments yet to come. The object in question is an ancient mask. The wearer of this mask is granted the rebirth abilities and supernatural power of a vampire. And as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve guessed by now, Dio gets his hands on this mask and makes quick use of it. And so begins the conflict that would last for generations. To stand a fighting chance against Dio and his newly gained powers, Jonathan came to learn of a mysterious force known as the Ripple technique. With both sides armed with their respective abilities, the only thing left is to kick some ass!<br />
<br />
This 1st arc doesn&#039;t truly pay off until viewed in conjunction with the 2nd half of the series (episode 10-26). Taking place 50 years after the events that occurred in the 1st half, we&#039;re introduced to Joseph, the grandson of the Joestar lineage, a kid that&#039;s an arbitrator of jokes and a whole lot of ass whippings. While he found himself confronting the same problems as his British ancestors, his methods of dealing with them are far less aristocratic. This is where Jojo truly becomes JOJO, as we&#039;re thrown into an adrenaline-driven narrative that takes the inklings of manliness only hinted at in the 1st half and amplifies it to insurmountable heights. With more battles, more poses, more manly moments, more epic face-offs, more white-knuckled encounters, and more bravado pumped into every scene; the 2nd half was pure awesomesauce! Action-packed and borderline nonsensical, for those only wanting a fix of GAR in their lives, look no further!<br />
<br />
Bringing this work to life, David Production made sure that every frame was oozing with personality. One noteworthy example of this was how they manage to juxtapose flamboyancy with manliness in a way that felt domestic to the show. On paper, the thought of these two worlds intermixing would seem like a disaster, but with the right amount of care and effort, David Production proved that the integration of these two opposing elements was not only possible but worth the effort, as the end result was impressive to look at. It was like high-end fashion meet the robustness of Mad Max. As odd as that sounds, the self-awareness in which the creators treated the project made every bit of it easy to buy into.<br />
This was further exemplified with a comic-book inspired art-style that they choose to incorporate, which used a mixture of pop art and bold graphic designs. This mixture of gusto and sass also bled into the characters. Every random pose highlighted with gonzo wall-texts and neon-color splashed everywhere. Outfits that looked like the illegitimate offspring of steroids and glitter dust. This weird hybrid of husky-man GAR and metrosexuality is a style that will become synonymous with the franchise.<br />
<br />
The music choice was also a mix-bag, ranging from new-school EDM, synth-pop, orchestral ballads, and old-school J-rock. There was never a dull moment with this constant rotation of musical styles. The soundtrack added an extra punch to a show that&#039;s already dripping with style. It&#039;s sensory overload in the best way possible. Another thing worth noting was the opening song, a style that&#039;s deep-rooted in the machismo crooning commonly found in the 80s and early 90s with a graphic visual style adopted from contemporary art. And as if all this greatness wasn&#039;t enough, we&#039;re even blessed with a 70s prog-rock classic for an ending, &quot;Roundabout&quot; by YES. In a way, the opening and ending themes were a great reflection of Jojo itself: old-school meet new-school. <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s ultimately the secret ingredient that makes JoJo so beloved by many. It&#039;s a love-letter to the past in an envelope from today. <br />
<br />
A title that&#039;s full of style, charisma, and self-awareness, JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure proves that you don&#039;t always need complexity to tell a compelling story, as long as you&#039;re fully committed and there&#039;s an undeniable passion behind it, even simple stories can become crowd-pleasers. And in that regard, JoJo was a success. It never tried to be more than what it was. It&#039;s an anime comfortable in its own skin. It just so happen that that &quot;skin&quot; is a muscle-bound brute with an odd obsession for fashion. If you&#039;re tired of seeing pushover beta-males and stories that take themselves way too seriously, then this title is for you. A title that has not only proven that GAR isn&#039;t a lost cause but also a missed part of the medium worth bringing back out of retirement.

    Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is popular for it&#039;s manga and I had no idea what to expect when picking up this anime. Manga is not my means of entertainment but the anime as it was presented to me intrigued me to watch it. It was recommended to me as a masterpiece, a must watch and as one of the best shounen with intelligent fights. So is it a masterpiece? To put it objectively, yes and no.Please evaluate the review after you have read it, thank you. Keep reading.<br />
<br />
First of all for those who have no idea what this is about let me clear this up for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review119859">
        you. It&#039;s about the rivalry between good and evil,mortal and immortal, between men of courage and those who succumbed to their fear of death and their mortality, those who find love and happiness in a family and those who believe happiness is in power and immortality. It&#039;s about men doing manly things and accepting their role and fate it is as gar as something can be. Sounds simple right? Well that&#039;s because it is. The story is in no way complex and one might say it&#039;s cliche and we have seen this before but the selling point of this show is it&#039;s over the top execution and exaggeration in everything it does. Characters who seem like they can&#039;t speak in a normal way and just yell all the time on top of their lungs, ridiculous over the top situations, exaggerated statements of obvious things(eg. sky is blue, he punched him, he is falling OMG!!! etc), ludicrous fight scenes where the mc&#039;s stop in the middle of the fight to take a great pose just to seem cool or say something awesome, over the top moments and unrealistic conclusions of fight scenes or storyline. Here arises a question of whether is this good or bad, is it enjoyable or not, does this fit the anime or falls flat on their faces? It does and it doesn&#039;t.Let me explain.<br />
<br />
The story consists of two parts or more accurately of two arcs. The first nine episodes are the 1st arc and the remaining episodes are the 2nd arc. Each arc has different main male character, different villains and stories but they are nicely connected together and to the main premise of the story. There are two magic elements that make this whole over the top approach work. The first is the fact that this show doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously like ever. The second and most crucial part in my opinion is the pace in which the story is developed. This is where the problem in the first arc lies for me. It was so horrible that I actually wanted to drop the show but glad that didn&#039;t. In the first part the pace is so fast that it overwhelms you with it ridiculousness, exaggeration and unrealism. Character development and story progression feels rushed. The motives for some characters to become close friends with mc are questionable and unrealistic. The main villain is bad just to be bad at least some of his actions indicate this or they are just plain stupid and pointless not to mention that some of his motives are not believable. So much stuff is unexplained or seems ridiculous that it falls literally flat on your face. Some people might like this but this is actually the main reason why someone might drop this show not giving it a chance which it deserves.<br />
<br />
After that the second part comes and here is where the magic starts to happen.The pace slows down dramatically and becomes incredibly fitting to the show. The main character changes, the story gets a lot better and the villains are just incredible. The development and progression of the story and characters becomes perfect. Suddenly the intervals between the yelling, the over the top fights, the posing, the exaggerated claims, the ridiculous moments and the unrealistic elements fall in perfect equivalence and if before they were overwhelming now they start to entertain you. The enjoyment skyrockets. The dialogues are funny and even the statements of obvious facts start to be enjoyable.One last thing to mention about the story is that the fighting system is fairly simple although individual elements can be complex and on top of that some strategical thinking takes place in most of the battles fought.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack in this anime is top notch. From your typical action and tension scenes to your melodramatic moments ost&#039;s are in perfect synch and fit incredibly well to every scene. Voice actors are just insanely good and bring out the manliness and badassness of the characters in the right fashion not to mention how well they fit to every character with no exceptions.<br />
<br />
Animation is amazing.Bright and intense colors are very pleasing to the eye and they enhance the over the top effect of the anime awesomely well. The facial expressions are distinct and the surrounding backgrounds are well portrayed which accomplishes the atmosphere and the mood of every scene. The battle scenes are very well depicted although the details of the background are left out it&#039;s in no way at the expense of the enjoyment overall. The only flaw that could be noticed is that at some moments it felt like I was watching a series of still frames but other than that it was very good.<br />
<br />
One aspect where this show exceeds is it&#039;s characters. The writer knows how to create enjoyable and memorable characters. Mostly this is true in the second arc because the pace is what determines the development of the characters as well. That doesn&#039;t mean that we don&#039;t come across with likeable characters in the first part. The second part has the most perfect male lead ever. Masculinity level over 9000. He is funny,smart,strong,charming and generally a badass. Side characters are very likable and memorable as well and almost none of them is pointless to the story. Villains are well developed and have their own personalities and ethics, some of them are real warriors and men with a capital &quot;M&quot;. You will definitely feel attached to some characters in a minor or a major way. They pose, they scream on top of their lungs, they have their own code and morals in life which they follow,they chase their goals and accept their fate like true warriors, they spout exaggerated claims and they are really enjoyable to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment factor is over the roof. If you are like me than you might find the first 9 episodes horrible but I strongly recommend to stick with it until episode 11 and then decide if you want to drop this show or not. If you want an easy fun ride where real men embroil themselves in epic fights for their honor, pride, their code in life or to protect their loved ones and humanity and they do it in an exaggerated, over the top, ridiculous way than this show is for you. Stop everything you are doing and go watch this but leave your critical self out the door and don&#039;t expect realism in a show where its primal goal is to amuse its viewers. Although you will find your fair share of intelligence,drama,action and comedy. I would have scored this a 9 if it wasn&#039;t for the first arc.<br />

Art: 8/10<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />

    If I had to describe JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventures with one word, that word would be, without a doubt, passion. A story of young and righteous men and their fight to secure a safe future for their families, friends, and ultimately, the world. A record of a fierce rivalry between the ultimate evil and a man who serves the side of justice, and the legacy they leave behind. A tale of fleeting romance, brotherly bonds, and, of course, hot blooded battles. This is the epitome of JoJo, one of the most unconventional, interesting, and captivating shows I have had the pleasure of watching thus far.<br />
<br />
JoJo&#039;s Bizarre

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141419">
        Adventures&#039; 26 episodes are split into two arcs, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. Phantom Blood tells the story of Jonathan Joestar, better known as JoJo, heir to the wealthy Joestar family fortune, and his fated encounter with Dio Brando, the son of a lowly con man, and how one ancient stone mask forever changed the fates of not only JoJo and Dio, but those who would eventually follow in their footsteps. Battle Tendency follows the life of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan&#039;s grandson and also known as JoJo, and how his grandfather&#039;s legacy ultimately involves him in a struggle to save the world from certain doom. Through larger than life battles, passionate characters, and, for lack of a more appropriate word, bizarre situations, JoJo&#039;s unique definition of the word &quot;epic&quot; certainly makes this show entertaining and addicting to watch.<br />
<br />
Even in the face of insane and unconventional battle scenes along with plot that was so over the top that it could have been considered silly, the aspect of JoJo that stood out the most, that was the most memorable, and that was the show&#039;s strongest selling point was its cast of characters, heroes and villains alike. Each important character has a unique personality along with their own strengths and weaknesses, and they all give you a good reason to either cheer for them or to absolutely hate their guts. You would be hard pressed to find another cast of characters that drew you to them quite like JoJo&#039;s cast of characters. <br />
<br />
Jonathan Joestar epitomizes the image of a true hero. He fights for the honor of his family, radiates an aura of kindness and gentleness, and protects those who are powerless. While mild mannered, he fights with the tenacity of a true warrior, and never gives up as long as he draws breath. His grandson, Joseph Joestar, while not as good-willed and honest as his grandfather, still shows genuine empathy towards his loved ones and respect towards his enemies. A fighter who relies more on his quick wits and brilliant battle strategy creating abilities rather than overwhelming his opponents through feats of strength; he utilizes the weaknesses of his adversaries and manipulates them to his advantage.<br />
<br />
It is rare these days to find a villain that truly embraces the meaning of evil, and one such villain that pulls it off excellently is Dio Brando. A man who will kill your dog because you angered him, steal the first kiss of the girl you&#039;re in love with, and simply physically beat you up from time to time can&#039;t be described with any other word other than evil. Treating the family that took him in after he is left penniless and alone in the world as a stepping stone to wealth and power, and taking every opportunity to trample upon JoJo&#039;s kindness and goodwill, he makes one believe that some people are simply born bad. A good villain should make your blood boil, send chills down your spine, or give you a sense of odd respect every time you see him, and Dio Brando is precisely the kind of man that will evoke all of the said reactions at the same time. The Pillar Men are the kind of villains that don&#039;t seem like evil incarnate, but their lack of empathy and desire to attain absolute power make them fine antagonists in their own right. I will refrain from describing them in greater detail due to spoilers, but they themselves will tell you exactly what kind of personalities they have; you can be sure of that.<br />
<br />
Watching JoJo was like reading an antique comic book from the turn of the century, both in art style and literal sense. The end of each episode made me immediately load the next episode, akin to eagerly turning the page of an action comic book to see what comes next. The age old sound effects of BAM!, or POW!, or ORAORAORA! (okay maybe not that last one), make the battle scenes much more entertaining, and I found my eyes glued to the screen for the whole 25 minutes of each episode. The story is fairly well written and fluid, and they take the time to explain any inconsistencies when they arise. While the action or story can become a bit overwhelming to the point where it seems silly, or ridiculous, or unnecessary, that is simply part of the experience of watching JoJo. When you take a show for what it is, you are then able to appreciate it more; JoJo is no different. <br />
<br />
The art seems to be, as stated before, straight out of a vintage comic book. Bold lines, action sounds, and muscular men make up 90% of JoJo&#039;s art, with the occasional beautiful woman. The animation is quite graphic, and is not for the faint of heart. There are bloody battle scenes, grotesque zombies and vampires, along with a whole plethora of other strange and insane scenes. The soundtrack is another one of JoJo&#039;s strong points. The OP for both arcs are catchy and will stay with you for awhile; the ED is &quot;Roundabout&quot; from an English progressive band called Yes, and suits the show very well (there are many allusions to famous music bands and icons throughout the show). <br />
<br />
JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventures is not a show for everyone. If you&#039;re the more logical or rational type who dislikes anything over the top and/or unnecessary/pointless, JoJo won&#039;t be your cup of tea. However, it is definitely a show worth checking out if you enjoy action, passion, and, of course, the age old fight between heroes trying to save the world and villains who are trying to either destroy or rule it. And remember, any resistance in enjoying the show is, in Dio&#039;s words, MUDAMUDAMUDA!

    JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is probably right now one of the most praised titles on this database, but is this actually deserved?<br />
<br />
Well, after an era where moe has overtake the industry, with shows trying too hard to be cute that ended up being annoying, plus the overexpose of those titles, it&#039;s no wonder a show that pander to old school anime fans, when the anime was good, and was full of GAR male and manly protagonist and not loser and pussies. But nostalgia is one of the best liars, and actually, the old school anime is, most of the times, ultraviolent OVAs without any substance, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229479">
        idiot plot and unidimensional characters that were just wish fullfillment to people wo dreamed to be real men. Real men, according to sexist ideas.<br />
<br />
JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is one of the most well-remenbered Shonen Jump&#039;s titles, along with Fist of the North Star, another GAR manga. Those days, studios made animes they&#039;ll know are gonna be successful, because making psychological cyberpunk thrillers with deep plot and though-provoking dialog is fine, but it&#039;s even finder made an anime that will sell after the bankrupt many studios had suffered. So, JoJo&#039;s was a sure value, it was gonna be successful. And it was, but not only in Japan, where is a loved classic, also here in the Western fandom, reaching really unexpected levels, with fanboys praising it, no one to contradict them and memes everywhere. (Who doesn&#039;t know the &quot;It was me, Dio&quot;?)<br />
<br />
The plot it&#039;s more a collection of sagas, with different protagonists, the mangaka improvises to make sure the fans get hooked up. It&#039;s always the same, there&#039;s a Joestar male family menber who can control a tecnique named Hamon, which it&#039;s actually a superpower working according the plot conveniences in every fight, and has to fight evil immortal vampires. The first anime season is based on the two first anime sagas.<br />
<br />
The first one is more idiotic, with characters completely undimensional and a  story so cliché you wouldn&#039;t believe it: our hero has a friend who turned out to be the villain and join the evil forces because he has a serious big ego issues, and after his fiend betrayed him and kill his family, he&#039;s now the chosen one to defeat this evil forces learning and training an ancient tecnique (Hamon). But before fight his archnemesis, he must fight tons of evil minions. Oh, and there&#039;s a damsel in distress love interest. Everything is as cliched as i told you.<br />
<br />
The second one is less cliched, but more narmy. Appears new villains, and some characters from the previous arc suddenly turned into ones despite they didn&#039;t showed any signs in the past. It looks like they&#039;re gonna have more badass female characters, but at the end of the day that&#039;s just a false promise. Female characters are still as passive as always. But what made this second half really awful is the over the top scenes like the killer squirrell, or the way the big bad is defeated. It&#039;s not so bad is good. It&#039;s so bad it&#039;s impossibly stupid.<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty frustrating. The hero from the first-half, Jonathan, fits more the traditional hero role, and it&#039;s eassier to root from him because he&#039;s more sympathetic, but he&#039;s so undimensional he becomes bland. The hero from the second-half, his grandson Joseph, he&#039;s a less tradiotional hero, and less undimensional, but less sympathetic too, and despite all the chances to develop him, actually he just become stronger, but at the end of the day you don&#039;t feel he changed that much.<br />
The secondaries go from idiots for pure plot convenience (Jonathan&#039;s father, trusting always people he musn&#039;t despite being obviously evil) to just so plain useful you need to pity them (Speedwagon, whose only purpose is commenting the obvious, or Smokey, only there to be The scream by Edvard Munch). But the worst is the first arc&#039;s main antagonist, Dio Brando, that&#039; so pure evil, so campy, so succesful in his plans because all the Joestars are so dense, with lots of wasted opportunities to have depth, but no, he just born evil. Just that. And he&#039;s obnoxiously egocentric.<br />
<br />
The art is pure cringe, defying anathomy and physics. And the so called fabulous posses are just ridiculous, making the sequences laugh-worthy. So, after all the crap i said, you must woonder, why is JoJo&#039;s so popular? So acclaimed? My answer is simple. Pandering. It panders to the ones who miss the &quot;good old days&quot;, who decide which animes are good or bad. At the end of the day, it&#039;s just wish fullfillment, like the harem based on light novels.

    Quick Disclaimer. I have a ton to say about Jojo&#039;s, so this review will be very long, which is saying a lot since my other reviews are crazy long to begin with, so read with your own discretion.<br />
<br />
Battle shounen have a bad rap in the anime community, and in my opinion, it is mainly for good reason. They are overly repetitive, extremely long in running time, and have extremely archetypal characters that develop very slowly because of said running time. However, this is only because the shows of the genre that are like this are by far the most popular (The Big 3, Fairy Tail,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185004">
        etc.). This creates a stigma that says that all battle shounen are shit, which I believe isn&#039;t true. Don&#039;t get me wrong, most of them are very bad, but there are a select few that rise above the failings that plague most battle shounen, and Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is one of them, even if it still isn&#039;t perfect (I hear Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a good example as well, but I haven&#039;t watched it yet :P).<br />
<br />
Since this show is split into two parts (the first 9 episodes adapts the first part of the manga series, Phantom Blood, whilst the remaining episodes adapt the second, Battle Tendency), I will talk about some things that help and hinder the show across both parts, and then delve into the pros and cons that concern each respective part after that.<br />
<br />
The main way this show decides to stray away from it&#039;s other battle shounen brethren is basically be as stupid as possible. There are so many logic flaws and asspulls littered throughout Jojo&#039;s Bizzare Adventure that you can find yourself facepalming at some points. On the other hand, however, the show wouldn&#039;t be nearly as fun without some of the silly shit it pulls. What it lacks in logic it makes up for with extreme passion and energy, and it&#039;s hard not to get caught up in the spectacle of it all. <br />
<br />
However, there was one thing that appeared readily throughout the runtime of the series that really tried to hamper the fun atmosphere it&#039;s sheer stupidity had set up. Every time a character tries to pull any sort of move or tactic, accompanying dialogue is there to spell it out for us. Granted, some explanation is needed for some of the more complicated plots the characters pull off, but it goes too far when a character screams something along the line of &quot;I&#039;m going to deliver a Hamon Kick straight to your face!&quot;. It&#039;s like the show assumes the audience is just as stupid as it is, and this dialogue can really take you out of the experience at times with it&#039;s excessive amounts of hand-holding. <br />
<br />
The last thing I will talk about with this show as a whole (except for art and sound, which will come later) is how much the spotlight is put on the two main characters of each respective parts. It really seems like the main characters are the only ones capable of moving the plot forward in this show. This doesn&#039;t mean that there aren&#039;t any other good characters in the show besides the mains, because there are. Hell, one of the mains is actually very bland. There are some very interesting and extremely likeable characters, but most of them have very little power with the plot, especially during fight scenes, where the main leads are always the ones to beat the bad guys, even when some characters are clearly stronger than them to begin with.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the two arcs separately, starting with Phantom Blood. For me, Phantom Blood is easily the weakest of the two parts, and it&#039;s easy to see why. With only 9 episodes dedicated to it, many elements of the plot feel extremely rushed, and we have no time to form bonds with most of the characters because of this. There are a decent number of characters for 9 episodes, and other than 3, none of them really get proper time to flesh out. <br />
<br />
The main character for this part, Jonathan Joestar, is the bland MC I was talking about earlier. There isn&#039;t much to him other than very basic motivations. He doesn&#039;t even have much of a personality to him. The only good thing about his character was his relation to the antagonist, Dio Brando, who is by far the best part of Phantom Blood, and possibly the only thing Phantom Blood does better than Battle Tendency. While yes, Dio&#039;s motivations are as cliche as they come (basically just become more powerful), it&#039;s the immense amount of pressure and pain he puts on Jonathan throughout Phantom Blood&#039;s length. He becomes such a menacing presence because he is with JoJo for all of his adolescence and young adult years, and we witness the physical and psychological torture he puts on JoJo.<br />
<br />
As for any other characters, the only character that I even sort of liked would be JoJo&#039;s mentor, Will. A. Zeppeli. He was very cool and a pretty decent mentor character, but he failed to really captivate me. Robert E. O. Speedwagon, Jojo&#039;s travelling companion, was basically just a commentator for this part, saying what happens during a fight, which as you already know, I very much disliked, so it goes without saying that I also dislike this character. Erina and Straizo are better in the second part, but fail to make much of an impact in this one, due to lack of focus mainly. <br />
<br />
If Phantom Blood was the only thing to this anime, I would leave this show with mediocre memories of JoJo as a whole. However, Battle Tendency had so much more to offer. Since there was many more episodes for Battle Tendency to make use of, everything benefited as a result. The plot, while probably more silly than the last, is a lot more fleshed out. Also, Jonathans grandson, Joseph Joestar, is a way better protagonist. While he comes off annoying and cocky at times, his energy and his tactics in battle make him much more of an interesting character. He embodies what makes JoJo&#039;s Bizzare Adventure good, and that is it&#039;s wacky yet passionate tone it takes. <br />
<br />
As for other characters, whilst they don&#039;t have much effect on the plot as said, they have such better personalities and backstories than Phantom Blood could ever dream of. Ceasar Zeppeli, Will&#039;s grandson, was a good foil to Joseph, with his more gentlemanly and suave personality initially clashing with Joseph&#039;s more brash attitude, and he also had a great backstory. The same can be said about the mentor character  this time around, Lisa Lisa. With a show that is teeming with overly muscular men, it is nice to see a woman who is just as, if not more powerful than most of the other characters. I just think the show didn&#039;t really respect her as much as they should&#039;ve. She get&#039;s used for fanservice purposes quite a lot, and whilst most other characters get this as well, she almost immediately gets sidelined for Joseph in fights. Still, she gets enough respect still be a good addition to the show.<br />
<br />
The villains of the show, save for Kars, are the weakest part of Battle Tendency for me. Whilst Kars is shown to be a very menacing presence much like Dio is, the other three, Santana, Esidisi, and Wamuu failed to capture that. Wamuu was the best out of those three, since he strayed a lot from the villain formula used mainly in this show. Although he was an antagonist, he was very honorable in comparison to his brethren, which was a nice breath of fresh air, even though he was fairly weak. Santana and Esidisi, however, didn&#039;t do much for me. <br />
<br />
Before going into art and sound, I saved my favourite character in this entire show for last. Rudol Von Stroheim, a militaristic and proud Nazi Commander, is the last guy you would think as the best character in an anime. He was just so badass and surprisingly selfless whenever he was on screen, and although there is a lot of screaming in Jojo&#039;s, his screams are the ones that are the most impactful to me. God he is just so awesome.<br />
<br />
The art and animation in Jojo&#039;s certainly isn&#039;t the best there is to offer when talking about newer anime. This isn&#039;t really surprising considering that the production studio, David Production, was founded by the former head of Gonzo, which is pretty notorious for less than stellar animation quality. However, unlike Gonzo, Jojo&#039;s is very consistent with it&#039;s artstyle, even if it the quality isn&#039;t the best. It is still effective when it comes to fightscenes, and is flashy and flamboyant enough when it needs to be, which is almost necessary for a show such as this one. The character designs are fantastic though.<br />
<br />
The sound is a bit of a mixed bag. The OST has some decent tracks, but many are filled to the brim with extremely out of place dubstep, which really can hamper the mood of the show, especially when you realize the show is set in the late 1800&#039;s to early 1900&#039;s. However, the two OP&#039;s and ED are fantastic for the show. With a show that has classic rock references everywhere, it is only fitting to have the ending theme be Roundabout by Yes, a classic rock single from 1972. Lastly, we have the voice acting. It&#039;s just so good. The screams are just so great. I can&#039;t get enough of them. SEKAI ICHI!<br />
<br />
Whilst Jojo&#039;s Bizzare Adventure (2012) is by no means a perfect entry into the battle shounen genre (not like there really is ever, but still), it manages to break away from the many tropes that hinder many of it&#039;s counterparts to give us a show with so much energy that you can&#039;t help but love it, even with so many flaws. Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is enjoyment in the purest sense of the word. It&#039;s something you can watch to just have a good time and not think about anything. Hell, it&#039;s probably better that way, or else you would probably end up hating it! If you want to watch something that is just mindless fun with a couple heartfelt moments sprinkled in, there isn&#039;t much of a better recommendation. It certainly looks like Jojo&#039;s is going to become one of those long running shounen, but this is one I can get behind.<br />

    JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken<br />
I&#039;m new to Jojo, i haven&#039;t read the manga so i didn&#039;t knew what i was getting into, nor i was expecting more than one protagonist, i instantly thought it was similar to Hokuto no Ken with a Castlevania type of vampires, and that was great, i was really surprised at everything this anime had to offer.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story has two parts, Part 1 is Phantom Blood and Part two is Battle Tendency; Part 1 starts with the story of two young boys that met in their youth, Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) a boy from a wealthy and respected family and with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202886">
        strong will and caring for people, and from the other side we have Dio Brando a boy from a poor family that arrived at the Joestar&#039;s mansion because Dio&#039;s father &#039;&#039;saved&#039;&#039; JoJo&#039;s father and owes him his life, so he takes Dio as his son, and since his arrival he is shown as a evil person, making Jojo&#039;s life miserable.<br />
There&#039;s a mask that will tie their destiny, for the worst (this part was the serious one and the bloodiest one) and Jojo will learn a technique to fight back, and it&#039;s called Hamon, a power using his energy.<br />
Part 2 starts 50 years later, more adventurous than part 1 and is focused on not only one mask but the creatures that created the masks, Cars, AC/DC, Wham and another creature Santana, fighting against them is Joseph Joestar, Jonathan&#039;s niece, alongside with other companions to his adventure. It has a lot of comedy than drama but with SpeedWagon in both parts everything gets more dramatic x10, it was funny even tho the scenes weren&#039;t funny, it was the exaggeration of him. I liked that they didn&#039;t put filler eps. with their training. The key of the story is the characters, the characters makes the story so amazing and enjoyable, filled with exaggeration and the vogue poses were hilarious, if you pay attention you will see a couple of background characters making poses, and how can i forget the crying machos full of testosterone, nothing manlier than a big muscular man crying for his Bro.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The art style is something that i liked a lot instantly, it has a manga like art style, i really enjoyed seeing that kind of animation, and sometimes the colors changed in some dialogues, i can point out a lot more, but is as simple as that, the animation was outstanding.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music was almost perfect, you can enjoy the really amazing VA to both great OP and the great ED just like the sound effects and the almost outstanding background music, but there was something that i couldn&#039;t stand, the thing is i like Electronica and its ramifications except aggrotech and the awful dubstep, and this anime has dubstep in some fights and not because i hate that &#039;&#039;music&#039;&#039;, i can&#039;t see dubstep fitting in an anime that has a lot of references of Rock, so it dropped the quality for me, but taking out that negative disgrace and put in everything else the sound in general was great.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters are really important in this anime, without the amazing characters everything else would drop in quality, the story wouldn&#039;t be the same if they weren&#039;t made like they actually are, so much character development and that&#039;s something important, i wouldn&#039;t thought this would made me shed tears, but it did, 3 times. It&#039;s important to point out that almost every characters has a name of a rock band or a rock band member, i spotted every single one and i laughed at how little time Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham were on screen.<br />
-Jonathan Joestar is a great character, seeing how much he grew from a boy who couldn&#039;t fight and was beaten by Dio in everything until he snapped and made a killer combo on him, it was wow, and then to a very mature and kind person, too much kind for his own good, but he can&#039;t be blame, it was his nature.<br />
-Dio Brando is one evil dude, that wanted to get rid of the Joestar&#039;s so he could take their fortune, he is one though hard to kill bastard who hates and respects Jonathan.<br />
-Will Zeppelli is a great character, is a shame that he wasn&#039;t that much on screen.<br />
-SpeedWagon is a unique character, he lived as a thug until he met Jonathan and his kindness, after that he followed him and considered him as a friend; But how can one character make everything more dramatic, the character that relates everything and explains attacks, happenings, he explains everything even the little details and the obvious things, if only he had a kid to pass that greatness.<br />
-Joseph Joestar is more of a goof, always taunting at his enemies, and staying cool and having an Ace out of his sleeve everytime for any situation, he is much less serious than Jonathan but is a kind person like him in his own way.<br />
-Ceasar Zeppeli is Will&#039;s niece, he is a casanova with a dark past to him, he has a competitive relation with JoJo, competing to outbest eachother and later on both developing a Bromance.<br />
And then there are other great characters like Wham, Strotheim and a bunch more that are great, there are a lot of characters for me to write about them, but it would be too long, i only have to point out that the VA on everyone was really amazing, even the support characters have the same engage as the main characters, that&#039;s why the characters are outstanding.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
What else can i write, with the combination of everything that i wrote already, you have an outstanding enjoyment.

    This first series of recent Jojo adaptations adapted two story arcs from the manga, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. With that being said, I will be reviewing both arcs to the series separately since their quality varies between both.<br />
<br />
Phantom Blood&#039;s role is to introduce Dio Brando and how he would become entangled with the Joestar family bloodline for later installments of the franchise. The storytelling here is rather bland to a good extent as it lacks the energy found with later story arcs of the series and our lead protagonist, Jonathan Joestar, is rather cliched with his typical pure-hearted personality. Ruthless parenting and strained sibling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176829">
        relationships are nothing new in anime, with these storytelling elements making Phantom Blood feel rather dated in terms of plot. On the plus side, later developments in Phantom Blood do redeem the arc somewhat when Dio&#039;s transformation into a vampire, the over-the-top action scenes and the title&#039;s penchant for naming characters after American rock musicians pop up.<br />
<br />
Battle Tendency is where Jojo&#039;s trademark energetic and over-the-top characters and battles are fully shown off when Jonathan&#039;s grandson, Joseph, is our new protagonist when he clashes with the Pillar Men. Unlike his grandfather, Joseph is a more fun protagonist here as he is more impulsive, loves to toy with his foes regardless of how heated things get and is known to improvise quite a bit to get himself out of heated situations. The Pillar Men are just as eccentric as Joseph with their personality quirks and being named after American music bands, yet are still formidable enough with their abilities to be legitimate threats to Joseph and his allies that test their abilities for combat and show off Joseph improvising whatever means he can think up of overcoming them. The substance of the series in terms of plot and characters is rather typical of shounen titles in its haphazard revelations and developments, but the style it milks is what allows Jojo to stick out from most franchises appealing to the demographic.<br />
<br />
In terms of presentation, this animated spin on Jojo does well for the most part with showing off the title&#039;s trademark energetic and over-the-top look. Details drawn on characters are exaggerated with the large, muscular bodies of the male cast and the series has fun milking use of bright color tones to compliment the energetic mood of the series. Stylistic approaches to the series such as some of the ridiculous poses struck by characters and sound effect texts displayed onscreen add to the title&#039;s fun approach. The soundtrack is energetic and diverse with musical selections such as militaristic themes, opera pieces and mysterious beats that help to enhance the exaggerated feel of scenes played out throughout the series. The only low point of the title&#039;s presentation comes from its rather subpar animation as shortcuts are employed at a number of points throughout the title&#039;s run such as still shots, jump shots and speed stripes.<br />
<br />
Issues aside, Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure was still a fun romp for the most part thanks to its stylish approach with its characters and battles and shows that there are occasions where style can prevail over substance as Hellsing Ultimate proved. Might consider giving later titles in the franchise a look whenever the opportunity arises.

    I wanted to avoid typing up a review but I think its about time that i mention this.<br />
<br />
(If theres people that actually like the show themself they are free to watch and enjoy what they would want to enjoy, this is just my personal review of the series.)<br />
<br />
Most anime might have really cringe storyline, artwork, jokes, overly lengthy ways of how they say things or mention people/other characters was just appalling..<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not even sure how people actually like this show.. although this might not be a spoiler anymore but the cherry scene where Kakyoin is like bouncing a cherry on his tongue and saying lick

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417597">
        lick lick lick lick and I&#039;ve watched past that episode into the other ones stopped watching at episode 13 and dropped it. (Edit: cherry part is when I skipped it hoping it was a meme from somewhere else)<br />
<br />
You&#039;re way better off watching something else or do something more productive with your time.<br />
<br />
1/10 Storyline cringe<br />
<br />
1/10 Artwork.. more like needswork <br />

1/10 Sound annoyance<br />

    Many people suggested JoJo to me and I probably came to watch it expecting too much.  This is a very generic shounen anime, with cool masculine elements added to it. Art is cool (even if I prefer the illustrations made by the author much more than their anime counterpart) and sound too. Story however is poor and the main reason is that characters are poorly written. The first arc features a bland protagonist with absolutely no depth behind his sense of justice and an even less deep villain who has at least a nice character design, but is just evil for the sake of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275857">
        evil. Other characters in the first half, expecially the mc&#039;s father, are just outright stupid. Other than characters, there isn&#039;t really much else for the story. A villain appears and main characters aquire poorly-introduced-super-powers to punch their way to the final fight. Oh and those super powers can do basically whatever according to the plot needs, with no consistency whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Second half is a little better than the first, as characters at least use some tactic in the fight, even if that is usually just a decently written @$$pull. Weapons materializing out of thin air because who cares are to be expected. Plot is still a mess but I enjoyed this part more, probably because by this time all my hype and expectations had already been shuttered. As soon as I turned my brain off and accepted the show as it is, it became less dreadful to watch.<br />
Do not come to jojo expecting a masterpiece<br />
Come here for a poorly written plot, dumb characters that explain their tactic to the enemy, a few punches and a lot of random moments. Come here for juvenile humor, muscles and the most linear story a shounen could tell you. Come here for a generic anime that&#039;s probably iconic for the sole reason that it was one of the first modern shounens and so ended up being influential.<br />
Still, I have to admit it has a certain style to it, with the manly feel, the cool poses and a few interesting character designs. That&#039;s probably its saving grace. And it &quot;could&quot; be enjoyable if you shut your brain off. I&#039;ll give the show a 5.

    Imagine if Dragon Ball Z was actually good, or if Kill la Kill wasn’t so weird.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for this anime. It takes a stupid, pointless idea and makes the best of it. The world has dozens of stories about macho dudes beating up other macho dudes because they don’t agree with their morals. In the worst cases, these stories are filled with overcomplicated fight systems nobody cares about, and silly monologues.<br />
<br />
The world of macho dudes who never really die, where time doesn’t exist is a bit tired now. Franchises like Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball will outlast the heat death of the universe.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212310">
        It’s bizarre how no author of these mangas pulled a Robert Jordan, but nothing is as bizarre as this anime.<br />
<br />
Macho-ness, like most tropes, is bad because it’s boring. The problem with using tropes has nothing to do with sophistication. It’s just that after seeing the same technique for 100 stories, you get bored. You become like JoJo and can predict their next sentences. Bad cliches are used by storytellers who don’t know what kind of story they want to tell. Is it an epic adventure? A silly show about silly people beating each other? An examination of good an evil?<br />
<br />
JoJo‘s strength is the focus, unlike all these shows. The anime makes it clear what it wants to be early in the beginning. Then, every single thing that happens connects to that. JoJo wants to deliver a simple story of good and evil. The bad guys are really, really bad. The good guys are really good and charming. If the fate of the world was really in the hands of a macho dude, we’d all be filled with adrenaline. When it’s a bunch of colors on the screen, you need more than this.<br />
<br />
Since JoJo knows its purpose is to deliver excitement, it will do everything it can to raise the stakes. Bad guys don’t come back after being defeated just because you can milk the show a little more. They come back because it raises the stakes, makes us wonder how they can be defeated. The anime establishes that everyone knows what everyone’s next move is, which is exciting because we wonder when will one of these will fail.<br />
<br />
Battles in anime always have pre-determined results. Every battle in anime is a man playing chess against himself. So a battle is only as exciting when the writers can challenge themselves, when they find ways to overturn their own schemes. The set-pieces drive the battles, not just meaningless shots of people using fists. Each battle is a progression of moves. It’s an odd way to describe a fight but they’re like a chess game in how every move has a clear influence on what happens next. There’s something thrilling in seeing a person trying hard to beat himself up in chess.<br />
<br />
It’s not the animation that sparks up the battle, which is weird. Most of the time, exciting fights are well animated. They have fluid movements that create a kinetic energy. JoJo opts for more still shots, but its set-pieces and beautiful progression saves it.<br />
<br />
The art style itself is very old school and gloriously macho. It’s so old-school it’s jarring at first. Everyone has a Schwarznegger build and dangerously low amounts of fat. Even characters who don’t fight look muscular, with square faces and bodies of an endomorph. This style can be ugly. It does suffer from Same Face Syndrome, but they make up for it in other ways. Where it fails to dazzle in character shapes, it succeeds in customes and hairstyle. Every important character has a unique, often elaborate dress style.<br />
<br />
In fact, beyond the endomorph build, JoJo‘s version of macho is unique. Perhaps it was common in old times, but today it’s rarer. We now love our heroes rebellious, slightly selfish and enforcing their morality in brutal ways. We want Deadpool and Iron Man, heroes who are only good because the plot requires it. The macho-ness of JoJo is the ‘respectable gentleman’, a man who respects even his enemies. The first part drills this the most, but even the second arc with the rowdy second JoJo has it. Wham is an honorable villain. JoJo duels him fairly and with respect, rather than with malice.<br />
<br />
So the characters don’t look gritty and tough. Rather, in the language of 12-year-old kids, they look gay. Their customes are elaborate and decorative. They look like men who are so sure of their macho-ness that they don’t mind looking so ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The female design also enforces this weird form of macho-ness. JoJo doesn’t downplay the female’s femininity. In fact, it shows it with all the glory. Although there are no ecchi moments, the female characters look distinctly feminine – lipstick, eyelashes, gentle features. A common problem in battle shounen is that everyone is so macho, the show is afraid of femininity. So besides having longer hair and breasts, the females look like men. JoJo doesn’t need sexuality to remember its female characters are female. It’s a macho series that doesn’t view femininity as a weakness.<br />
<br />
For all its fun (and it’s a lot of fun), there’s a glass ceiling it cannot break. It’s a great macho adventure about saving the world, but that’s all there is. It does a lot with its style, but it’s always limited by it. Dragon Ball Z looks pathetic next to it, but JoJo is overshadowed by Kill la Kill. For all of its weirdness and energy, it never becomes as absurd Kill la Kill. It aims there and it succeeds enough to not become useless. I’ll definitely check out the sequels, but Imaishi’s cartoon prove there is so much more you can do with macho bullshit and saving the world. The fact JoJo keeps up with it and and is still worthwhile is a point for it.<br />
<br />
JoJo is excellent at what it does. There are plenty of silly people who think there’s no value in adventure stories about saving the world. It may not be Kill la Kill, but it gets everything else right – the pacing is focused, the art is beautiful, the fights are coherent. It’s the sort of thing that inspires a lot of anime that can’t measure up to it.<br />
<br />

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
Nothing on this planet exists quite like the notion of family. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents; everyone has or has had them. And while we may not always get along over the dinner table, deep down the connections we share with our family are unlike anything else we know. Many times, these bonds are tested, often verging on the point of breaking. But with a careful hand (and maybe a bit of Hamon), the ties that bind us can truly never be broken. Such is the tale of JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure, and what a tale

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171335">
        it is.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Our story begins with Jonathon Joestar, a young boy who earns himself a new brother, Dio Brando. After many altercations, the two find themselves at a crossroad.<br />
<br />
Immediately when the anime begins, it gives off an enticing presence. It&#039;s not overpowering, but you know right from the get-go that this one behaves completely different from anything before it. The overly detailed characters, the verbose explanations, and the over-the-top outcomes of anything that goes on culminate in this amazing vibe the show gives off. It might be somewhat unfair to say, but it&#039;s better to experience it than to have it described to you. That&#039;s how unmistakable and unique the show feels.<br />
<br />
The story, getting slightly spoiler-y, spans multiple generations of the Jojo family tree. It&#039;s actually quite fascinating for two reasons: it shifts the focus from one main character to the next and allows for complete and fulfilling story arcs. Time skips in any show are always a tricky thing to pull off, because it requires the audience to reinvest themselves in characters that either had rushed/skipped character development or in ones that are brand new.<br />
<br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure opts for a mix of the two. It utilizes both old and new characters to make the transition easier. By providing the old ones, we as an audience already understand and know their background. Their purpose, then, was to serve as catalysts for the new. In this way, the new characters never feel distant, since their literal familial history gives them the needed personality and character traits. Now, obviously, the later characters stand apart from their ancestors in one form or another, but the way in which everything tied together so nicely was great to see.<br />
<br />
If there was an award in &quot;Explaining the Current Predicament,&quot; Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure would win with flying colors. No matter the situation, no matter how dire things may seem, the show will, without fail, explain exactly what is going on. Interestingly enough, this never gets old. This is most likely due to the nature of the show itself being incredibly over-the-top and crazy in the first place. The overall goals during each arc are simple, and are not the focus. Instead, it&#039;s what is happening then and now. Whether Jojo is running with a football or holding a glass of water, every detail is looked at. This further adds to the already awesome presence the show gives off.<br />
<br />
One final note. Being completely honest, Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is the same from beginning to end. It doesn&#039;t explore any themes, it&#039;s not trying to enlighten you, and it never provides a new insight on life. It&#039;s a wacky ride from start to finish. And while in context it is coherent in the story it tells, there is really nothing here to analyze. It&#039;s tough men and women fighting to save the world.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Another standout feature in this adventure is the art style that the anime adopts.<br />
<br />
First and foremost come the character designs themselves. Gone are the days of huge eyes and scraggly teenagers late into high school. No, the characters here are &quot;real&quot; men and women. Taking place in areas outside of Japan, the characters fit the part, both in aesthetic and physical appearance. Furthermore, everyone is heavily detailed. Contours on their faces, sharp lines for their muscles, and varying outfit choices make them stand out not only from among different shows but from one another as well.<br />
<br />
Second, the style. Style here isn&#039;t so much the art but in how it is presented. In this case, it is done in &quot;comic book&quot; fashion. Actions sometimes get accompanying onomatopoeia, facial close-ups, frame breaks; it really feels like a comic book has come to life right before your eyes.<br />
<br />
Last but not least is in the art itself. The show essentially takes all the colors of the rainbow, puts them in a bucket, grabs a handful of this paint, and chucks it at the drawings. What we get are a flurry and amalgamation of colors that are constantly changing. It not only makes the scenes contain varying and interesting color palettes, but makes the different scenarios refreshing to look at since they morph every few minutes or so. It&#039;s a really cool effect that the show employs masterfully.<br />
<br />
One of the show&#039;s faults comes in its actual animation. For the most part, it is quite minimal. The massive amount of character details, the cool presentation, and the revolving art are the portions of the show that saw the majority of the resources, leaving little for this section.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure has a slew of characters, but I&#039;ll talk about some of the more important ones: Baron and Caesar Zeppeli, Speedwagon, Jojo, and of course, Dio.<br />
<br />
Baron and Caesar are what most men aspire to be: charming with the ladies, strong both physically and mentally, and stalwart in their convictions. But above all else, they have the innate ability to do whatever it takes to turn the situation in their favor. If anything, their characters serve to demonstrate that sometimes we can&#039;t always do things on our own. Sometimes, we require a little outside influence.<br />
<br />
Speedwagon is that guy you wish you had as a friend. It doesn&#039;t matter what you may be doing, he always has your back through thick and thin. And if we had to give that explanatory award to one individual, Speedwagon earns it without a doubt. Almost exclusively there to give us the rundown of what is going on at that very second, his &quot;power&quot; isn&#039;t demonstrated until much later, and even then it is only alluded to. Constantly in the shadows of the more vocal and obtuse men of the show, he may seem like a side character, but there is no Jojo without Speedwagon.<br />
<br />
Jojo is definitely a good protagonist. Smart, strong, and skilled in many arts, his ability to turn a situation in his favor is rivaled by no one. His success as a &quot;Hamon&quot; user makes him a force to be reckoned with, and his chivalrous ways allow him to be the true gentleman that he&#039;s always been. Right alongside Speedwagon and the others, you&#039;ll be calling out &quot;Jojo!&quot; right up until the finish. At this point, you may be asking yourself, &quot;Yea, but which one?&quot; To which I respond, &quot;Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arguably the best character from the show is Dio Brando. His characterization is interesting because of how well it plays with the family idea. Driven by hate towards his own father and the Joestar name, he makes it his mission to thwart Jojo whenever he can. He&#039;s not necessarily wrong, just completely misguided. He&#039;s intelligent and honorable as a warrior, and his ideals about obtaining power and ruling over all are evil. But these goals mirror his true feelings; he&#039;s extremely lonely. Pushing Jojo and Jojo&#039;s father away was more instinctual than intentional. He never really experienced true love, in any form, in order to allow him to realize that what he always really wanted was right next to him all along.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The first OP sort of &quot;sets the stage&quot; for what the show is all about. It&#039;s not so much a song as it is a small poem. The best part is actually the &quot;Jojo&quot; part that happens a select view times; it sort of sounds like the beating of a heart.<br />
<br />
The second OP is more artistic in its lyrics and presentation. The trumpets, vocals, and continuous drum/cymbal beat make it a bit more lively, coinciding with the more lively atmosphere and characters.<br />
<br />
The ED is obviously the most interesting. Not only because it is a Western song, but why it was chosen in the first place. My interpretation is not so much in the lyrics themselves but in just the title alone: &quot;Roundabout.&quot; That is, as is demonstrated by Jojo time and again, the solution to the problem at hand is almost always quite roundabout.<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtrack does have some good pieces, such as the triumphant score that plays when Jojo is going to win or the Pillar Men&#039;s more Aztec sounding piece. Also of note here is the sound effect, used to great effect, when the camera is zooming in or moving from one scene to the next.<br />
<br />
Voice acting wise, I found everyone did fine work in the roles they represented. This is especially true for characters like Speedwagon or Von Stroheim who consistently had to scream or elevate their voices to match the scenarios at hand.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recall not laughing during any single episode for this one. There was always something ridiculous happening on screen, from the comedic writing to the crazy yet &quot;realistic&quot; answers for the zany holes that the characters found themselves in. Even just Speedwagon saying, &quot;What?!&quot; or the bad guy at the time going, &quot;Impossible!&quot; would always give me the biggest grin imaginable.<br />
<br />
The show is not afraid of showing some rather gruesome material. Things such as accordian&#039;d fingers, heads chopped horizontally at nose-level, and melting flesh are the norm. If someone gets unsettled by such content, the anime might not be for them. But if you can handle such brutality, it just makes the entire experience that much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure is just straight up fun. It&#039;s presentation, the story, and the writing make it supremely different from almost any other show out there. On enjoyment alone the show could be considered perfection. It honestly is that much of a great time. But considering the whole package, the final product doesn&#039;t quite reach that status. Yet it goes without saying there isn&#039;t and probably will never be anything quite like Jojo.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, Jojo makes its mark<br />
<br />
Animation: Good, unique art style with little actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Great, Jojo, Dio, Speedwagon, and the rest play their parts<br />
<br />
Sound: Good, okay OPs, good ED, nice soundtrack, nice VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, really nothing else like it<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10
