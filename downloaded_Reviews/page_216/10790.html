    Do you want to root for an abusive romance just because it&#039;s yuri? Do you want to see non-consensual lewd yuri scenes? Do you want to see people cheating and causing others pain? Do you like watching people so unlikeable that even those with the lowest of self-confidence can point to them and remark, &quot;Well at least I&#039;m not like them.&quot; Then NTR is for you. <br />
<br />
Not only is NTR filled with terrible people doing terrible things, but it&#039;s also a terrible story filled with terrible characters. First off all of these characters besides the main guy are unlikeable. Yuma is at least meh, but

        she still does terrible things even though it should be obvious that what she&#039;s doing is wrong. Ultimately I view her more as the scapegoat for Hotaru&#039;s abuse rather than someone to hate on her own. However, her own &quot;feelings&quot; towards Hotaru are so tacked on and poorly done that it makes it hard to like her even with this knowledge. She&#039;s tainted by those around her and what the plot decided to do with her. Especially when she started to turn into a controlling douchebag too. It was as if they thought 2 controlling douchebags weren&#039;t enough, they needed to have 3 of them.<br />
<br />
Fujiwara and Hotaru are the worst of the lot, and it&#039;s hard to imagine characters that are worse than these two. Hotaru is a manipulative and abusive dirtbag. She frequently comes onto Yuma under the guise of helping her. Then she molests her without her consent even as Yuma tells her to stop. The show is clearly trying to go with &quot;Yuma loved her all along so it&#039;s ok&quot;, and makes this clear as it develops. But no, that is sexual abuse and it is not ok. Furthermore, the way that Hotaru acts is disgusting. She manipulates Yuma into relying on her for everything. She is trying to be her practice, her outlet, the thing that helps her stand. This is a common abuse tactic as it makes it that much harder for the person to get rid of their abuser. She&#039;s trying to make it that she is needed, so that she can&#039;t be disposed of, and quite frankly it&#039;s disgusting. The way that she tried to plant seeds into her mind that she liked it, the way that she takes advantage of her, and the way that she has no respect for relationships or boundaries. I don&#039;t even care that much about the cheating, I care about the main ship is one that&#039;s based off an abusive relationship.<br />
<br />
And no just because Hotaru is being abused by Fujiwara does not make it ok. In fact, it only trivialized it as it feels so phoned in that it&#039;s hard to take seriously. It&#039;s clear that they&#039;re trying to come up with some sort of excuse for one of their leads to be abusive, but it just doesn&#039;t work. You can&#039;t just magic away something like that, especially with an obviously evil villain. It looks fake, and like it was all set up just to excuse her. Which again I find disgusting.<br />
<br />
Even outside of abuse the two girls basically tell each other that they can&#039;t-do / shouldn&#039;t do the very exact things that they themselves do. I&#039;m not sure why I would want to watch a bunch of controlling douchebags but here is NTR to provide that. <br />
<br />
The sad part is the last guy is actually decent and show what someone should be like in a healthy relationship. However, all he gets to show for it is to be cheated on and lied to. I&#039;m so glad that we get to see the only decent person here suffer. Thanks, NTR.<br />
<br />
Did I mention the story? First off its crap. It can&#039;t decide between echii fanservice or drama and thusly switches between the two without rhyme or reason. As a friend of mine put it, there&#039;s too much drama to just enjoy the echii, and too much echii to distract from the drama. Not that the drama is any good, and personally I find it hard to enjoy echii between scumbags. Even worse is the fact that story ends up stalling. For a good half of the show, it decides to go no where with it, and just leave at the same point. Stalling is terrible and for a show that already has so little to say and do like NTR it just makes it worse. Although admittely every minute that they don&#039;t progress means that it&#039;s every minute farther away from the yuri couple getting together, which is a benefit although a small one. Not to mention it keeps on cycliDo you want to root for an abusive romance just because it&#039;s yuri? Do you want to see non-consensual lewd yuri scenes? Do you want to see people cheating and causing others pain? Do you like watching people so unlikeable that even those with the lowest of self-confidence can point to them and remark, &quot;Well at least I&#039;m not like them.&quot; Then NTR is for you. <br />
...<br />
<br />
Wait was I somewhere? Sorry about that. But I&#039;m sure you can see how that can be annoying..<br />
<br />
Not to mention it keeps on cycling the same plot ideas over and over again as if it&#039;s incapable to come up with new ones, which at this point I&#039;m pretty sure is exactly what happened.<br />
<br />
The art is also pretty bad, and the production values are all terrible. I never really payed attention to the sound because these immoral douches drowned out any care I had about the other parts of the show. When a show glorfies a couple based off cheating and abuse it&#039;s hard to care about any other part of it. Add to that a story that goes no where and some of the least likeable characters imaginable, you have a recipe for one of the worst anime out there, which NTR is.

    The first thing you should know about Netsuzou TRap is that it&#039;s absolute trash.<br />
<br />
If you still want to stick around, you should also know that it&#039;s pandering to the NTR fetish. For the insanely small percentage of anime fans that don&#039;t frequent hentai sites, &quot;NTR&quot;, or &quot;netorare&quot;, is the cuckold genre; some poor guy gets his girl stolen by someone who&#039;s usually insufferable.<br />
<br />
Except this time, the guy is getting his cute girl stolen by another cute girl, causing me to have conflicting feelings. She&#039;s still a bit insufferable (though the story does try to justify her actions by implying she&#039;s going through some difficult stuff

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253841">
        herself), but the yuri scenes are great, and will likely be even better on a future BD release.<br />
<br />
The art was pretty bad in the first episode, but improved over time. <br />
<br />
Netsuzou TRap regularly frustrates me, and yet I keep watching it, so I think it&#039;s doing its job. NTR fans will likely have a better time with it than I am.

    You have to meet one of two criteria in order to find some value in this anime<br />
<br />
1. Have a fetish for netorare, a phenomenon where the viewer is made to feel intense jealousy over a character cheating on their significant other<br />
<br />
2. Are desperate for some sweet sweet yuri action regardless of the surrounding circumstances<br />
<br />
If you meet neither this is probably the worst anime of the season by a mile. If you meet one or both it becomes tolerable<br />
<br />
NTR has some of the best yuri scenes in recent memory. The girls are extremely attractive, one submissive the other domineering, and the two have great chemistry together<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258184">
        level of netorare is tame compared to the extremes usually found in the genre. Turns out two girls banging each other is less emotionally jarring than cheating with someone of the opposite sex - in most cases a mutual friend. Instead we have a naive girl who got into a relationship not really understanding what it meant to date someone, and being pulled away by her best friend who she&#039;s probably loved all along. Her biggest fault here is not telling her boyfriend, Takeda, of what was happening behind his back. Not necessarily her swaying feelings itself.<br />
<br />
I found the manga to be unbearable because it doesn&#039;t go anywhere but the anime at least tries to offer a somewhat of a conclusive ending. It&#039;s the better version of the two for sure.<br />
<br />
The MAL score and reviews are correct, this is an incredibly trashy anime pandering to the lowest common denominator of hard dicked miscreants in the anime community, but one mans trash can another mans treasure and there&#039;s value to be had here if you meet the targeted audience.

    Netsuzou TRap is a show I initially hated, but upon giving it a second chance after it had finished airing ended up liking quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Going into this show my experience with yuri anime was limited to shows like Sakura Trick and Yuru Yuri, where the characters tended to consist of naturally likeable, pure hearted angels who would be cute and endearing to watch, but not at all representative of actual people.  These unrealistic expectations led to a pretty rude awakening upon first checking out Netsuzou TRap, and made me dislike it enough to outright drop it.<br />
<br />
Some months later, with a much firmer idea

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263285">
        of exactly what I&#039;d be in for, I checked this show out again and feel I can actually rate this very highly.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d describe Netsuzou TRap as a visceral character drama about a cast of naive, insecure and otherwise emotionally vulnerable people. You have Yuma, our kind-hearted protagonist who means well but through her confusion and misunderstanding of her emotions is prone to being taken advantage of, or inadvertently causing pain for others.  Hotaru knows exactly what she want, but not how to express herself in a way that&#039;s healthy or responsible. The boys of the show, a nice guy and an asshole respectively,  serve more as mirrors for Yuma and Hotaru to reflect off of rather than interesting characters in their own right, but this works well and feels appropriate considering the short episodes and length of the show.  <br />
<br />
Whether or not you enjoy Netsuzou TRap will depend pretty much exclusively on whether you can empathise with the main characters, regardless if you think they&#039;re right or wrong. If you watch anime purely for the escapism, you likely won&#039;t find much value in this show. If you find character studies more interesting or like watching characters who aren&#039;t perfect and who have all the flaws and fears that real people might have, then this might be more your kind of thing.<br />
<br />
The story as a whole is fairly tight and works its way soundly to a fairly conclusive ending that, for once, doesn&#039;t require further reading of any source material to appreciate. I personally liked the character designs and artwork, and although it didn&#039;t bother me that much I feel as if it could have done with slightly more animation and less panning shots. <br />
<br />
In terms of yuri, there&#039;s a fair amount of it and it&#039;s pretty decent both on a romantic and sexual level, but it wouldn&#039;t necessarily by why I&#039;d recommend the show, even though it&#039;s the reason I started watching in the first place.

    &quot;Netsuzou Trap&quot; is a very poor netorare show. If you’re not familiar with the term, netorare shows are shows that deal with adultery, aka cheating on your partner. In this case, it was Hotaru cheating on Fujiwara with Yuma who, in turn, cheated on her boyfriend Takeda. While the characters gave a valiant effort to try and save this show from being absolute trash, it didn’t do enough to make it decent. The only blessing about this show is the length of the episodes (9 minutes). This anime is something you can get in, watch and get out of rather quickly so there really isn’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review259699">
        any harm in watching the show. There definitely is a lot worse out there. Generic would be the best word to describe this....

      Before this show came out, I had been a fan of the manga. The story isn’t particularly good, but good art and yuri is enough to keep me entertained. Luckily, this anime was released, giving me the opportunity to uncover the very poorly hidden flaws in the original story as well as directing and writing errors in the adaptation! As the manga progressed, I was actually kind of happy to see that there was a toxic relationship between Fujiwara and Hotaru. Granted, Fujiwara’s blank face immediately gives away that something is wrong, but regardless I was interested to see how they would turn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253888">
        out. That is, until I started the first episode.<br />
<br />
Once I saw that each episode of NTR would only be 9 minutes with about 2 minutes’ worth of opening and ending, I already knew that the anime would not give the manga what little justice is deserved. But with this terrible cast of characters, I don’t even think a full length show would help them. From the manga alone, I was well aware of the fact that Takeda and Yuma weren’t the most interesting characters, but it’s the anime that makes this very blatant. The only thing I’ve seen Takeda do is blush and look like the stereotypical male side character of a romance anime. Yuma has it even worse. Most of her lines are “Wh-what?! Hotaru!” and her only emotion is embarrassment. I’m honestly surprised that the two of them actually managed to be in a relationship. High schoolers or not the two of them lack romantic chemistry of any sorts and are only capable of blushing to one another.<br />
<br />
When I complain about an anime, I rarely stray from talking about the story, characters, and uses of animation to tell a story. However, I feel like I would be committing a sin for not mentioning that some of the direction in this show is just jarring. My first complaint is that the opening doesn’t fit with this show in the slightest. I couldn’t care less about the pictures that go with it seeing that each time I see it, I’m distracted by the rock song playing. There’s no way to get around it either. If I were to mute the opening, I’d have to watch basically some moving stills for a minute and 30 seconds. The opening lacks much actual animation and tries to cover everything in effects and filters to give the illusion that something cool is happening. It doesn’t help that the ending is a textbook definition of putting the bare minimum of effort into something.<br />
<br />
Aside from the opening and ending, the direction of the show at some points is just horrendous. I had to rewind some scenes several times just to understand what was happening. This may sound like an exaggeration so let me give two examples. From episode two, there is a scene where Hotaru pulls Yuma into a kiss from behind a bush so that somebody inside the school can’t see them too well. When Takeda calls for them from the school window, the animators portrayed the distance of the characters and their positions in relation to one another so poorly that I thought that Takeda was diagonal from the girls rather than above them. The second example has to be the most amateur thing I’ve ever seen in anime. From episode 2 again, Takeda shows up to Yuma’s classroom to ask about going to the amusement park during the weekend. Yuma thinks ‘I’m not ready’ and then THERE IS A FAST FADE AWAY AND THE QUARTET IS IN AN AMUSEMENT PARK. This scene actually made me do a double-take.  If you choose to make episodes of a somewhat story driven anime to only have 6 minutes’ worth of content, at least get a director who can make decent transitions.<br />
<br />
As stated earlier, I don’t like Takeda and Yuma due to their flat personalities, but it’s really Hotaru that disappoints me. Partially due to the rushed pace of the show, the changes of her mood are laughably fast. You blink and she’s sad. Then you blink again and she’s suddenly cheerful again. Also, I really don’t think they casted the right voice actor for this role. Her VA isn’t bad but sometimes her performances make Hotaru’s relationship with Fujiwara seem like it came out of a hentai. I am convinced that Fujiwara is not actually a character but rather a brick with a face painted on it that has up to 3 speaking lines per episode.<br />
<br />
Despite my complaints, I do have some praise for the show. I’m happy that the yuri in this show is not diluted. The censoring matches the censoring of the manga. Instead of literally turning Yuma and Hotaru’s bodies into clouds *cough Love Stage cough* they actually depicted sexual scenes which is rare for any anime that focuses on a homosexual relationship that’s not a hentai. <br />
<br />
My last problems are entirely revolving around the art and animation. I won’t lie, the art looks nice. Not anything at the levels of Kyoto Animation, but nice to look at. But there’s always a catch with this kind of show. Where art hardly makes up for the visuals, the animation can be dreadful. Most of the times it’s just decent but others it’s so funny looking I actually laughed. An example being towards the end of episode 4 where Hotaru is playing with Yuma’s chest while she talks to Takeda on the phone. Hotaru kinda shakes around and it honestly looks like they pulled the scene out of a Windows Movie Maker video.This scene also leads to my main issue with the art. Every character suffers from a severe case of same-face syndrome. If you were to take a shot each time you saw the  SAME EXACT faces used for every expression, you’d be in the hospital getting your stomach pumped halfway through the fourth episode. Even so, EACH CHARACTER ONLY HAS A MAXIMUM OF THREE EMOTIONS: Default,embarrassed, and sad. Embarrassment is only shown with a blush which I can’t really complain about, but sadness is shown through the loss of a character’s pupils.<br />
<br />
All in all, each episode of this show feels more like a trailer rather than  an actual series. It looks like the staff wanted to quickly use whatever popularity NTR had, and pump out whatever they could to make a quick buck or two. Once again, another yuri show has left me disappointed. I can&#039;t believe anybody is actually watching this for the story so let me say, you’re better off watching some hentai.<br />

    First of all, why the fuck these girls look like Oregairu&#039;s Yukino and Yui, with their personality and boobs swapped. Secondly, the genre mentioned for this anime is Shoujo, which i feel for echhi/hentai lovers will be fantasy.<br />
<br />
It was my first time watching an &quot;Bisexual&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
First episode was just like &quot;Tutorial : How to Kiss a Girl (for all genders)&quot;. The only best thing which i found was duration : 9 minutes ( including OP and Ending). Story has some direction but can&#039;t say it&#039;s positive or not. Character development wasn&#039;t tad bit of focused at all either.<br />
<br />
This is only how i can rate this

    Finally, after all this time, we get a proper yuri anime which focusses on the sexual relationships between two girls! A one of a kind, niche thing.<br />
<br />
Netsuzou TRap isnt for everyone. It only targets those who like yuri anime and want to see girl on girl action which is hardly seen in anime, especially sexual relationships, because of the controversy behind the LGBTQI+ community. This anime is a game changer and hopefully will inspire other anime to be free in it&#039;s story writing regardless if it&#039;s controversial.<br />
<br />
The story is quite predictable but this is a yuri anime. It&#039;s satisfying and hits the marks for what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253845">
        you expect this anime to be; an NTR anime. Two girls each have boyfriends and they start &quot;experimenting and practising&quot; sexual acts with each other in order to be more experienced when the time comes to engage in the acts with their boyfriends. However, when experimenting with lesbian sexual acts, they come to realise that they are growing more closer and more affectionate to each other. This becomes a problem when they try to maintain their relationships between their boyfriends while keeping their lesbian sexual encounters a secret. This anime is only 9 minutes long per episode, which is shorter than a standard anime episode. This allows unnecessary fillers in episodes and allows the anime to get straight to the point without having to add unnecessary information that will only bore the viewer. However, the short 9 minute episodes does also feel like there is a lot cut out and makes the pacing of the show rather fast which some may not be used to. It makes waiting each week more excruciating as we aren&#039;t getting as much information as we would with a standard anime episode. This anime has a simple concept and will make a small part of the community who like yuri very happy.<br />
<br />
One gripe I do have with this show so far though is that the supposed sexually explicit scenes are watered down and doesn&#039;t quite give a full &quot;yuri&quot; experience but at the very least this anime goes slightly beyond your typical shoujo ai.<br />
<br />
The art and animation in this anime is nothing exceptional. It&#039;s like every other anime, they all pretty much look the same anyway. However, it still looks pleasantly good and it will please viewers and it&#039;s an art style we are all familiar with. On a side note though, I love the blushing Okazaki does whenever Mizushina does something unexpectedly sexual to her.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is alright. The OP gets you in the mood to get prepared for the start of the episode and the ED leaves you with a satisfied feel after knowing the end of the episode has come. I like this voice acting in this anime, especially with the two main female protagonists.<br />
<br />
The two main girls are very likeable and the character development is explored through their growing relationships through their sexual encounters which allows us to see their progression through their controversial lesbian relation; from initial deterrence to acceptance and overall satisfaction of sexual acts from someone you know well of the same sex.<br />
<br />
Overall, I am enjoying this series so far as it&#039;s something different from your typical shoujo ai anime.<br />
<br />
I recommend this anime to those who want to see a proper yuri anime.

    So this story is about two girls who are best friends, Yuma, whose point of view the story is from, and Hotaru. Hotaru is in a relationship with a boy named Fujiwara, and Yuma recently started dating a boy named Takeda. Hotaru actually loves Yuma and is in an abusive relationship with Fujiwara, so she proceeds to rape Yuma multiple times during the show. Yuma doesn&#039;t do anything to stop her because she is her best friend and doesn&#039;t confess about it to anyone. (Also maybe gets a case of Stockholm syndrome, it&#039;s been a bit since I&#039;ve watched it.) Takeda begins to feel like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286234">
        Yuma is cheating on her/ is using him, so he breaks up with her. Yuma is destroyed by this and is on the verge of a mental breakdown. She tries to get back with him after finding out about her friends abusive relationship and being raped more and I believe he agrees or just agrees to be friends for then. Again its been a bit since I&#039;ve watched it and I&#039;m not about to waste my time again. This whole show is just rape, abuse, mind break, and Stockholm syndrome. If you like that, then you will probably like this show. The reason I decided to write this review is because I saw someone rate this show a ten, which is fine I guess. But he called it a mutual love for the girls and both the boys being played by the girls, which is complete BS. I don&#039;t care if you like this show, but call it how it is.

    Netsuzou TRap is a wild ride, but a ride you will enjoy all the way through. I wouldn&#039;t be lying if I told you I watched the whole thing in one sitting.<br />
{STORY} A few spoilers lie ahead so you&#039;ve been warned<br />
The story follows our two leads Hotaru and Yuma, best friends who are both dating guys. Takeda and Fujiwara. It follows Yuma and how she struggles with dating. Luckily she has Hotaru there to show her how it&#039;s done. Most of it revolves around yuri action while the girls develop feelings for each other. Although at first, the story may seem a bit controversial, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314962">
        is defiantly worth your time. <br />
{ART}<br />
It&#039;s standard, there&#039;s nothing really special about it.<br />
{SOUND}<br />
the music was fine, I didn&#039;t really notice anything that stood out.<br />
{CHARACTER}<br />
Hotaru: She may seem a tad on the unbearable side at first, but honestly in the second half she is downright the best character.<br />
Yuma: she&#039;s the airhead who is very gay, but pretends she isn&#039;t. <br />
Takeda: he&#039;s a good bean. he deserves better.<br />
Fujiwara: Is actual garbage. A rapist and domestic abuser. Needs to die.<br />
{ENJOYMENT}<br />
I think I enjoyed the drama in this show a little too much. It was really fun to watch and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.

    Overall, I&#039;m enjoying this anime enough. It won&#039;t be everybody&#039;s cup of tea (obviously). It reminds me of Sakura Trick with less &quot;yuri for guys&quot;. It depicts more of an actual struggle in people with confused feelings on sexuality.<br />
<br />
I think people are being much too harsh on this anime. Granted, the anime tries to squeeze in quite a bit in 7 minutes, and the story moves quickly, so it lacks impact to some degree.<br />
Still, the characters actually have depth to them, and their relationships are actually different and fairly interesting. Hotaru comes off as a bit calculating and almost as though she&#039;s using Yuma, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255494">
        it seems more like she&#039;s in love without a proper outlet.<br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s going to appeal to those who can relate, rather than yuri fanboys. So far, the story, and above all, the relationships, are more fleshed out than people give them credit for.<br />
And the character design is nice, I&#039;ll give them that too.

    I think the reason people don&#039;t like this show is because it breaks a lot of conventional anime rules. A lot of people are going into this expecting it to be like most other anime, which is a mistake.<br />
<br />
These characters have flaws. All of them. They all have flaws, and they aren&#039;t portrayed like other anime where they ~magically overcome their flaws with the help of the person they fall in love with and they all live happily ever after!!!~<br />
<br />
No, man. You can&#039;t go into every show ever expecting that same resolution/closure, and i think a lot of people are selling this show short/stifling their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338152">
        own enjoyment of it with that expectation. <br />
<br />
This show portrays these flaws and the development of these characters in a realistic way, as opposed to pretty much all other anime that end the way i described above. It&#039;s not because of lazy writing, the character arcs don&#039;t feel unfinished. It&#039;s just not realistic that all of the characters overcome all of their flaws by the end. Sometimes it doesn&#039;t work out that way, and that was INTENTIONAL. They talk about Yuma&#039;s flaws even at the very end.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m willing to admit that the story itself isn&#039;t mindblowing. It&#039;s not bad, but what made this show special for me is the writing for the characters. The tension Yuma finds herself with in the mess of a situation that develops feels very real, and the characters have a realistic progression. It feels like this show nailed how the situation would have played out in real life, not ~magic fantasy anime land~<br />
<br />
I think the realistic take on a situation isn&#039;t sitting well with a lot of anime fans given the score this show has, but it&#039;s sitting well with me. I thought it was good.

    As the title suggests, this is a show about cheating, so by that point alone, it won&#039;t be for everyone. If you don&#039;t want to see major characters being complete pieces of shit and toying with other people, just avoid it altogether.<br />
<br />
The problem with Netsuzou Trap, however, that it&#039;s not even good at being an NTR series. Because of how short it is (9-minute episodes, including a full-length opening and a short ending sequence, leaving a stunning 6,5 minutes for actual plot), it ends up feeling rushed and shallow. To make some kind of impact, it could&#039;ve chosen two different approaches - going grimdark like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304451">
        School Days, punishing the characters for their behaviour, or elaborating on their internal conflicts and giving them a proper chance at redeeming themselves. It did neither, ending on a horribly unsatisfying note.<br />
<br />
I think it didn&#039;t have to be that way, if not for one fatal problem - Hotaru. Her boyfriend, Fujiwara, being an abusive dickhead fitted the formula, just like the protagonist, Yuma, being torn between her attraction to, and later love for Hotaru and unwillingness to hurt her genuinely nice boyfriend, Takeda (spiced up by the confusion about her own sexuality). Yume makes questionable choices and could be considered a bit spineless, but means well all throughout the story. Hotaru, however, not only acts like a psychopath, seducing, sexually assaulting and toying with Yume, but the justification the show gives for it is simply absurd. She receives a happy ending with Yume, while everything she deserves from her is a slap across the face. Paradoxically, the one real &quot;romantic moment&quot; the show offered was the one that upset me the most - it didn&#039;t earn this conclusion in the slightest.<br />
<br />
The show is also pretty tone-deaf, including comedic moments that completely don&#039;t fit its general climate - it makes School Days look like a masterpiece of an NTR drama. Unlike some, I didn&#039;t really hate all the characters and the general concepts Netsuzou Trap uses (I really did enjoy School Days after all). It simply doesn&#039;t know how to use any of them properly or how to appeal to any of its possible audiences. It fails as a yuri romance and it fails at least as hard as an NTR show. Even the fanservice isn&#039;t very interesting, always either including Yume being sexually assaulted or the scene being interrupted by someone (after all, you have to condense all the conflict into the tiny runtime). It ends up being and series for no one and without any real redeeming qualities. <br />
<br />
Avoid, unless you want to watch it from morbid curiosity, like I did.

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
Being trapped in some form is almost never a fun experience.<br />
<br />
It doesn’t have to be tangible like locked inside of a room because of a misplaced key. It could also be a mental cage of sorts like anxiety or depression. Whether from a physical or a psychological standpoint, the trap is set, and the feeling of helplessness consumes.<br />
<br />
One other way to reach this same feeling is through watching Netsuzou TRap, an anime which “traps” the audience with boredom, uselessness, and irritation aplenty.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Those with a keen enough eye will notice a strangeness in the title of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294008">
        this anime. The “r” there is capitalized for a reason: to complete the initialism “NTR”. In this context, “NTR” stands for “netorare”, an infamous genre within the sphere of animated Japanese pornography (i.e., “hentai”). It centers on unwanted sexual advances of an extreme measure. While this description purposefully avoids simplified, coarser language for the sake of professionalism, suffice it to say that NTR is a niche among niches.<br />
<br />
Thus, true to its title and as it forewarns, Netsuzou TRap channels this genre in the content it delivers. A young lady name Yuma dates her new boyfriend Takeda as she contends with her best friend Hotaru and her “pranks”. Now, the anime by no means reaches the same level of depravity (if only because it is not considered hentai), but the genre’s shadow falls over this anime across its just-under-two-hours runtime.<br />
<br />
Fetishes aside, the audience will find next to zero value within this darkness.<br />
<br />
The show attempts to prove differently, though, with its risqué scenes between Yuma and Hotaru. Representing one of its only major allures, their presence at least makes sense given Hotaru’s motivations and the negative nature of the narrative. Yet the anime doesn’t know what to make of them. Yuma will be shocked and appalled at Hotaru’s actions but will soon after forgive-and-forget. Which leads back to shock and then once again to forgiving and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Such a churn gives Netsuzou TRap the vibe that it is not so much a worthwhile story with some ecchi material sprinkled in but rather a bunch of lewd moments loosely stringed together by a haphazard narrative. That is to say, a lame excuse for some perverted asides. This argument becomes more apparent when sifting through the non-risqué scenes.<br />
<br />
For instance, infrequent tonal problems pop up despite the seriousness of the situation. Hotaru jokes about (not) raping Yuma despite the serious tone of the situation and having literally felt her up in the bath minutes prior.<br />
<br />
There’s also the dialogue and how it treads the same ground over and over. Yuma repeats constantly about understanding Hotaru and being so close to yet so far from Hotaru and hating the fact that she does not know every side of Hotaru. It gets very same-y very fast.<br />
<br />
Its dramatic edge chooses not to find anything beneficial, either. Netsuzou TRap contains potential talking points about homosexuality, relationship abuse, and the meaning of love. Yet, much like the ecchi content, their existence within the anime rarely leads to a stronger thematic foothold.<br />
<br />
Realistically, if one wants an interesting story, it isn’t here. And if he or she wants some titillation for the imagination, it would be better to seek out normal porn (hentai or otherwise). Thus, because this show fails in both regards, it remains out of the light indefinitely.<br />
<br />
ART &amp; ANIMATION<br />
<br />
The visuals for Netsuzou TRap rise above the story they present. That’s not saying much and, indeed, not by much anyway.<br />
<br />
At the minimum, the character designs, while not exactly inspired, conform to the anime’s aims and the characters personalities. Takeda is plain looking to go with his good-guy self, and Fujiwara is a bit more eccentric (taller, unkempt, silver palette) to go with his bad-guy self.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Yume’s design (lighter coloring) and Hotaru’s design (darker coloring) coincide with their opposing roles within the show while still maintaining their cute and refined looks. Furthermore, the show bolsters its ecchi scenes with better animation than usual, making sure that the grabbing, touching, and caressing matches the intensity of the ladies’ lust.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the artistry leaves much to be desired. The bland setting hardly ever stands out. Weird fade-to-white cuts happen on occasion to move the setting along. Its jokey style which accompanies the comedic moments feels out of place.<br />
<br />
More generally, the quality of the visuals lessens as the season progresses with lower movement and worsening actual animation. Episode six is particularly bereft of problems, such as forgetting to include Hotaru’s side ponytail and mistimed mouth synchronization.<br />
<br />
With these errors and the boring artistry in general, the visuals scrape by at best.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Netsuzou TRap mostly centers on four important people: Yuma, Takeda, Hotaru, and Fujiwara. Yuma dates Takeda, Hotaru dates Fujiwara, and the lot of them find their relationships tested on many different fronts.<br />
<br />
Yuma is the most out of tune with her feelings, and so her designation as the main protagonist makes sense. Nervousness keeps her from going further with Takeda, a young man who sincerely respects her and their romantic bond.<br />
<br />
On the complete opposite end, Hotaru seems to know exactly what she wants, letting Yuma know as well (under the guise of “practice”). Same goes for Fujiwara. As he would put it, he hates women but loves sex, so his own “bond” with Hotaru barely extends past hormonal needs.<br />
<br />
Besides Fujiwara, whose involvement equates to a fourth-wheel given his barebones connections with the others, the cast of Netsuzou TRap arguably stand as the show’s strongest aspect. If only because they own up to their respective parts in this dramatic dance.<br />
<br />
For instance, Yuma struggles with her tumultuous feelings for both Takeda and Hotaru. She understands how poorly she treats him with her distractions and her unwillingness to face their relationship with maturity even as he always gives her the benefit of the doubt. And, with Hotaru, her small backstory about protecting her best friend and having parallel jealousies in her aloof behavior pull her the other way.<br />
<br />
Hotaru herself refuses to budge from her common tactics of evilness, leaving her in static state for much of the season and thus failing to have a very impactful arc. Nonetheless, her manipulative personality is easily seen throughout Netsuzou TRap. She lies about her emotions. She forces unfair predicaments. She commits to underhanded plans. As her overbearing forwardness weighs down on both Yuma and the audience alike, her deplorable actions feel heavy in their implications and their control. Yes, she’s a mean person but designedly so.<br />
<br />
As for Takeda, he’s simply a cool dude, a regular guy like anybody else. His lovestruck thoughts do not impede his supportiveness, for he reads boundaries and offers advice when possible, even as the situation turns against him. Compared to Fujiwara, Yuma, and Hotaru, who wrestle with or outright indulge in the shadier side of the mind, his saint-like attitude shines as a glimmer of hope and friendliness. Unfortunately for him, the phrase “nice guys finish last” rings true. Yet he can also rest easy knowing that he – and he alone – has the moral high ground when all is said and done.<br />
<br />
So, unlike the rest of the anime, the characters at least have some solid ground to stand upon.<br />
<br />
MUSIC &amp; SOUND<br />
<br />
Netsuzou TRap decides upon a curious option. Where the average twelve-episode anime has only one ending track, this anime instead includes three different EDs during the season. A new one appears every three episodes (except for the final three episodes), giving the audience an unexpected change of pace every now and again.<br />
<br />
While these moodier pieces do not have much intrigue in the way of instrumentation or musicality, knowing that the show went out of its way to create multiple tracks deserves at least some recognition.<br />
<br />
The rest of the audio direction falls short of such praise. The opening track, “Blue Bud Blue”, goes for a pop-rock song that loses its nifty guitar playing amidst the loudness. The voice-acting performances provide next to nothing of note save for perhaps Hiromi Igarashi as Hotaru not having as much nastiness in her way of speaking as needed. And the original soundtrack, while trying its hardest, fouls out with its simplistic approach.<br />
<br />
Altogether, the sound work within Netsuzou TRap is more negative than positive – a common occurrence throughout the entirety of this project.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
A lot of my readers know that I am a big fan of the “yuri” genre. Admittedly, it’s a big reason as to why I even gave the show a shot in the first place. What I watched, though, wasn’t very rewarding or very interesting in the slightest.<br />
<br />
In fact, the more I got through this anime, the more I came to like a different, almost opposite part entirely: Takeda. He is way too nice of dude to have to be put through these events, and I was rooting for him the whole time because he totally deserved better than he received here (title of the anime notwithstanding).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the show rarely contained anything of note to me. The romance elements were mostly icky. The scenes as portrayed had little weight. The ending didn’t seem all that convincing or satisfying. The show’s only saving grace? It’s short enough that it avoids becoming an absolute slog to complete. But this situation also works against it, for the anime leaves the brain as fast as it entered.<br />
<br />
Netsuzou TRap just barely survives a full hounding. While its cast members reach mediocre execution, the rest of this unremarkable, uneventful tale locks itself away and throws out the key.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Terrible, a schlocky narrative that holds very little value on either the ecchi or the dramatic side<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Bad, an uninteresting visual direction with visible errors contains some meager designs for its cast members and marginally improved animation at times<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, Yuma introspects, Hotaru manipulates, and Takeda supports, fitting their roles within this journey well enough, but Fujiwara lacks involvement<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound: Bad, while the changing EDs surprise, the tracks themselves and the audio in general miss the mark<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Bad, Takeda is at least a super-cool guy<br />
<br />
Final Score: 2/10

    First of all, this is a rant, written in poor English. And Netsuzou TRap is horrible &amp; will be that way till the end.<br />
<br />
On the 5th episode (and another disgusting cliffhanger) I&#039;ve decided to read manga to know the continuation (all translated 16 chapters)... it won&#039;t get better. Anyone who gave this anime chance, like me - stop right now, please. Save some hope for the ones who deserve it.<br />
<br />
Now in details.<br />
Netsuzou TRap has completely OK-tier art and mediocre animation, but the greatest trouble is in the characters. I still remember the feeling of disgust from School Days and Makoto-kun. That nice boat in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254691">
        end healed some scars on my soul, but in NTR... you will meet the 100% bastard, with no character and charisma who will force you to despise him all the screen time, being the complete failure as a human being...<br />
...who will just get away with everything. And be treated like his behaviour is okay.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the thing I can&#039;t stand. Portray anything, as evil, immoral and twisted as you like... but don&#039;t show it as *perfectly* normal.<br />
<br />
If you have anything like moral compass, I mean, even that little bit that can survive half a hundred R+-rated titles (with Netsuzou TRap rated PG-13 - I still wandering who was bribed and with what amount of money) - you will despise this anime, its creator and everything about it.<br />
<br />
I even thought about a little improvement for MAL - creating black list for authors. This feature would help you never meet anything related to people you choose. And I would have only one name in the list - Kodama, Naoko, original creator of this abomination.

    After I watched six episodes of Netsuzou TRap, I think I have to write something. I will analyze the show first and then write some of my own thoughts. <br />
Story: 5 <br />
Just one word to describe the story: disappointing. So what&#039;s the story actually about? It&#039;s just a nine-minute short anime, pointless. There is nothing that people try to express through this show... There are two cute girls try to make love in order to give the audience fan service... And the rest of it is also like garbage. Their relationship with their &#039;&#039;boyfriends&#039;&#039; is ridiculous, let&#039;s see what will happen next. The show actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255102">
        is halfway yuri and halfway school romance, it ruins both...<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is probably the only good. It&#039;s mainly made by the Jakarta department of Creators in Pack. This studio is good at making short series. All of the drawings and colours in this anime seem to be pretty nice.<br />
Sound: 5<br />
For the sound part I feel like the OP, ED and background music is about to be average. There is nothing special and it&#039;s kind of dull. But in fact, the music is not too bad.<br />
Characters: 3<br />
Horrible, just horrible. Boy1: handsome airhead. Boy2: a smart guy that only interested in having sex. Girl1: previously normal girl that has a boyfriend but now she is becoming one of the yuri group. Girl2: originally yuri girl who surprisingly finds a boyfriend. These meaningless combinations are just gross. It just takes advantage of the Yuri fan, but as a work of yuri, it&#039;s also a failure. I&#039;m just going to finish it painfully because my no-drop policy. (Don&#039;t be angry, it&#039;s my personal opinion.)<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
If there is something I enjoyed during watching this, it&#039;s the artwork for sure. Cute girls! However, I think this is the ONLY advantage of this show. But if I only care about cute girls, why shouldn&#039;t I go watch Ecchi anime???<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Overall, NTR TRap makes me lmao. I don&#039;t mean it in a good way, for sure. Why did I laugh? Well, this show makes me wonder how boring the anime nowadays can be... As these cute girls having yuri sex on the screen, I feel like I&#039;m looking at a bunch of clowns...<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Thank you so much for reading! Ah? You say it&#039;s not ending? Yeah, now I will write some random thoughts about anime nowadays, and, personally, I feel like it&#039;s even more important than a single anime review.<br />
Time flew, the world of old anime fans doesn&#039;t exist anymore. The time that people need to treat anime with their true love doesn&#039;t exist anymore.<br />
I was born in 2002, not as old as most of you, but I started to watch anime since 2006. Back then, there were not a lot of anime websites, were not much people in my country who loved anime, and there were not countless comments as well. Aya Hirano became hugely popular with Haruhi Suzumiya. The most popular download format was still RMVB. Even Crunchyroll and Niconico were just formed. Back then, anime was 30, 40 mega and with very low resolution, we watched them with pure joy.<br />
There was no &#039;&#039;Kawaii&#039;&#039;, no &#039;&#039;moe&#039;&#039;, and no &#039;&#039;Waifu&#039;&#039;, too. The anime video got expired very fast, and we had nowhere to save them. Countless DVDs, represented our previous memories. Back then, I could only read every word and illustrations, and even advertisements of a monthly anime magazine with my full attention. I saw every review on the thick magazine as my treasure. I would watched the free DVD inside the magazine several times, even if it was an anime that finished airing long time ago. I cherished them, because it&#039;s not easy to get even a single letter about anime culture.<br />
But now, it&#039;s totally different.<br />
Countless information makes anime become a hobby with extremely low standard. If we move our fingers a little, we can get the information of previously ten days, or even several months in a single day. The anime info is so various, as a result, it will probably make some people go wrong way. Paper media is beaten by new media, the hard-working writers for the anime magazine doesn&#039;t exist anymore. Why? Because there won&#039;t be people who spend a whole day reading a freaking long professional anime introduction. The characters nowadays are always overly exaggerated, seems like this is the only purpose for anime. People just look at the characters instead of analysing the anime meaning itself and simple joy is replaced by following the crowd. Don&#039;t ask them why they became like this, it&#039;s because the period has changed. The period that you had to try very hard to satisfy you hobbies has passed.<br />
Back then you tried so hard, nowadays, people can get it easily.<br />
People would never cherish things they could easily get.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
PS: My words don&#039;t mean to hurt newcomers at all. If you are a freshman to anime, welcome!!!!! :D It&#039;s just some random thoughts... I was sad when I saw this dull anime. Thank you again for taking your time to read.<br />
But, but...<br />
Good times would never come back, right?<br />
<br />
<br />

    So this is an NTR anime which means if you are like me and despising cheating or looking for a good romance go no further and skip this. Before the review, just wanted to say its an anime only ending so  if you decided to invest in this series anyway, go the manga route.<br />
<br />
Story 3\10<br />
Long story short, a girl cheats on her boyfriend with her best friend which is also a female. So a yuri ntr anime to sum it up. It shows how our main MC Yuma, deals with guilt and being secretive to her boyfriend while cheating and trying to find her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257424">
        feelings. Sadly even though most of us would not enjoy the plot in the first place, its done terrible as well having the characters do unrealistic and unnatural acts in order to keep the show going and relying on cliffhangers since this is a ten episode series. <br />
Art 5\10<br />
This is a ten minute per episode series, so the art is gonna take a hit along with this series has 21 chapters as of this review an anime should be the LAST thing on the creators mind. The budget was dispersed equally and while not bad at all, it is lower then 2017 standards but this never really bothered me and it most likely will not bother you.<br />
Sound 8\10<br />
Read carefully because this is most likely the only thing I can praise about this anime. While music is subjective to each individual, The Opening was a great listen along with the ending. The OST is also where you may find some great music. I remember the OST from this anime the most besides my anger at this anime but The music will stay in your head and would be an excellent edition to a good anime but sadly it went to this...<br />
Characters 2\10<br />
Point of the show for most is learning to hate every character. You hate the girls cheating, along with how stupid the MC is. The main guy is our dense main protagonist of any harem where he wont get the most obvious hints of her cheating. We also have a misogynist but funny part is, he brings up the best points and does care about his friends at the very least.( note I hate the word misogynist since feminazis and sjw take it out of proportion but there is a quote and his actions that prove this).<br />
Overall 3\10<br />
The manga is a bit better, but I suggest unless your into the NTR genre or like cheating I would strongly advice skipping this anime but maybe listening to the opening on youtube or something.<br />

    Do I like yuri? Yup.<br />
Do I like Netsuzou TRap? Not even if I died.<br />
You see the problem with this series is that it could have been a good story, the potential was there, but it was wasted with stories of abuse that were not over-analyzed and a homosexual love story that had nothing particularly compelling. I would certainly have preferred something more like Shoujo Sect, which despite being a hentai has a lot more romance than this pile of dung that is called anime.<br />
But who am I to judge, right? I&#039;m just that poor devil who had to watch a cheap yuri. This anime is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312720">
        an animated torture. I left this anime after the sixth episode. Too much dung for me.<br />
If you are masochists, I send you my best wishes because this series is for you.

    For a Shoujo Ai anime, i guess it was one of the greatest example for this theme. <br />
 <br />
Anime shows, how the main character getting affected by her feelings for his best friend getting changed from being a friend to lover in this 9 minute short episodes.<br />
<br />
The thing is that, its not just showing a lesbian relationship, at the same time showing the social problems comes within school and around. <br />
<br />
<br />
We have the main character so self-contradictory. And i really did hate the main character tryna answer the same questions nearly in every episode. At the other hand we have the boy who has crush

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412905">
        on her doing the same thing. This two characters of the anime literally got me wanting to hang myself. it was so disgusting.. this self-contradictory thing taking so long was a note breaker for me..<br />
<br />
And second couples acts were good. We got the boy being a literal dhead but still the girl has to don&#039;t ruin the contract. and the wild contract about their relationship was a great point in the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall drama was remarkable and interesting. and it is very short so didn&#039;t get bored while watching.<br />
I definitely recommend watching in a free time for ya&#039;ll who is interested in shoujo ai theme.<br />
<br />
Personal ranking: 8/10 (for its category)

    I&#039;ll be honest. I didn&#039;t expect a thing from this series and I&#039;m still disappointed. I haven&#039;t read the manga and I&#039;m watching this anime only because I&#039;m getting into yuri, so I&#039;m not gonna criticise this anime based on its faithfulness towards the manga, but for what it is.<br />
<br />
I despise Netsuzou TRap with a passion and it is easily the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen, so I&#039;m gonna get with the positives first.<br />
The art is kinda nice and I like the yuri scenes (although they don&#039;t show anything). That&#039;s it. There&#039;s nothing else positive or enjoyalbe with this piece of trash that some people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254711">
        like to call anime.<br />
<br />
First of all, the main gimmick of this piece of fiction is probably the worst thing about this anime and it makes the other aspects of it really unenjoyable. This anime is about a girl who cheats on her boyfriend with another girl. I&#039;m no one to judge the kind of fetish/fantasy that this anime offers to it&#039;s audience, but adultery is a horrible act that should not be romanticized in such a way.<br />
<br />
Following with the characters, they are the four most disgusting people I&#039;ve had the displeasure of encountering in a piece of media. I&#039;m not gonna call them by their names because I don&#039;t remember nor care what they are called.<br />
<br />
The pink hair girl is a complete idiot who doesn&#039;t seem to know what infidelity is, but sure likes practicing it. Even if it seems like she is geting forced to romantically and sexualy engage with the dark hair girl, she doesn&#039;t complain about her friend harassing her and she obviously enjoys it. She is a horrible person who does not like her boyfriend at all and she has him suffering like an idiot, while she kisses or fornicates with her girl friend.<br />
<br />
Dark hair girl is even a worse person than pink hair girl. She is the one who constantly harasses her friend in a sexual matter. She seems to do this because she is fisically abused by her boyfriend, but I think this is a really stupid excuse to make her harass someone. If someone is being abused by their partner/friend/relative, they tend to abuse other loved people too, but not in the time they are abused, they do it in a more distant future, when it seems their emotional wounds have been healed.<br />
<br />
White hair boy is by far the worst of all this characters. He fisically abuses her girlfriend (dark hair girl) and he is not mad about her girlfriend cheating on him, instead he uses it in his favor to blackmail her. This character is clearly a sociopath that doesn&#039;t care about the well being of anyone but himself and there is nothing remotly relatable or redeemable about him.<br />
<br />
Brown hair guy is the only character I don&#039;t dislike, but he is such a poor unlucky bastard. He gets cheated by his girlfriend (pink hair girl) and he doesn&#039;t even notice although being really obvious to everyone else. He is a moron that doens&#039;t really deserve what is happening to him, but should know better.<br />
<br />
Being done reviewing each character and interactions, only leaves me with the story. The plot is nearly inexistant. I mean, the characters do stuff and go to places, but everything they do is completly unimportant, being the only important parts the ones where the characters harm each other in one way or another.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t finished this series and I don&#039;t know if I will, but I highly doubt this anime with horrible and unrelatable characters, boring plot and morally questionable themes will get any good.
