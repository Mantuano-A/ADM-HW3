    By some coinsidence on the internet, I came into contact with Rozen Maiden through the probably all to known DESU meme, and random recommendations from several websites. I started watching Rozen Maiden somewhere during fall, and finished watching somewhere before December. Here comes my review of the anime.<br />
<br />
Story - This is one of the highlights of the Rozen Maiden. The story about Jun and how he comes in contact with the dolls is an action-filled, emotional, yet humorous sotry. The makers of Rozen maiden has managed to make a fine mix between humor, drama and action, and it is rather clear what nature each scene

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1921">
        is of. It should be clear what episodes make the story go forward. Some things, however, may be confusing, but these are explained in one way or another through the anime. The plot holes in the story leaves the watcher with some questions. Many of these plot holes are filled in in tr&amp;auml;umend, however, so this makes it even moe worth to keep watching.<br />
<br />
Art - There&#039;s really only one thing I can say here. The art is outstanding, and is also one of the major qualities of the show. Ranging from the modern Japanese suburban style of where most of the story takes place, to a more 19th century Victorian style of the N-field, the visual range of the anime is simply amazing. The dolls clearly differ from the humans in design. The 19th century style of the dolls clearly stand out from the modern look of the human characters.<br />
<br />
Sound - This has to be the only downside of Rozen Maiden. The opening credits may be interesting to hear the first few times, but after you&#039;ve heard it some times, you will start to feel it gets on your nerves. The opening credits are not really the best I&#039;ve heard, by far. As for the ending credits, it is not at all as annoying as the opening credits. It is even quite calm and enjoyable, and does not get annoying after a few times, unlike the opening credits. The music that occurs in the show is in good touch with the scenes, with distinctive music for all types of scenes. However, many are played so commonly that you start to recognize them every time you hear them. It is not annoying, unlike the opening credits, but when you&#039;ve heard the same song for every scene of the same nature, you&#039;ll want some different music for a change. As for voice actors, I believe they couldn&#039;t have done a better job for the japanese voice acting than what they already did. The voices fit the characters great, and I can&#039;t think of any flaws. If there is something that stands out in the sound department, it is definitely the voice actors.<br />
<br />
Characters - This has to be another of Rozen Maiden&#039;s shining points. All of the characters have their own distinctive traits. For example, the main Character, Jun, is a secluded, traumatized young boy who has an interest in buying supernatural things. As the story progresses, however, one will notice how he changes as a response to the dolls that he comes in contact with. The dolls themselves are rather unique themselves, each housing their own distinctive traits and personalities. For instance, while Shinku may be aristocratic and dominant, Suigintu is cold and full of sorrow, while Hinaichogo is as innocent as a child. The character that seems to help the bond grow between the characters, is Jun&#039;s older sister Nori, who treats both Jun and the dolls with lots of love and care. While she is not the most prominent of the characters nor a very integral in the main plot, she is an important character nevertheless, and a strong support to everybody.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - To put it shortly, this is the best anime I have seen. It is rich of humor, action and drama, and is put together in a very good way. You may want to watch this many times just to catch all the aspects of the anime. This is truly an anime to remember.<br />
<br />
Overall - As I said before, this is the best anime I have seen. If you like action and drama with a good sense of humor, this is an anime for you. I promise you, that you will not be dissappointed. Wonderful story with a beautiful style, and much diversity makes this anime something you can relate to. And if you like the original anime, then Tr&amp;auml;umend and Ouvert&amp;uuml;re is a must to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 10/10 DESU

    This definitely isn&#039;t a genre I&#039;d usually watch from, but given that, I guess it wasn&#039;t as bad as it could have been.<br />
<br />
STORY - To be honest, despite this series only being twelve episodes long, it took a while for me to figure out what exactly the plot was, and when I figured it out, I wasn&#039;t much impressed. In the beginning, everything seemed to happen pretty arbitrarily. Nothing was really explained, and things just seemed to keep happening for little or no reason. This was annoying, and I found myself losing interest pretty quickly. It was slice-of-life with unexplained fantasy elements. And when the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6161">
        story did finally emerge, it still seemed mediocre at best. <br />
<br />
Because they were the fantasy elements in an otherwise very ordinary world, the story of the dolls and the Alice Game seemed much more interesting than the social anxiety struggles of a middle school recluse. But really, I found it hard to sympathize with either parties. The dolls were not explained well enough to garner sympathy, and even when they finally were (like, during the second-to-last episode), the situation seemed too absurdly simple, and I still wasn&#039;t impressed. Jun&#039;s plight was also only described vaguely until the very end of the series, and then, it was even less impressive than the dolls&#039; story. My reaction was pretty much, &amp;quot;Are you serious?&amp;quot; I had expected something much more tragic. To some extent, I suppose it&#039;s interesting to consider that even something so simple could have such a great affect on a person, especially considering the pressures within Japanese society, but it really wasn&#039;t presented well enough to be effective.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER - Given the weak story and the slice-of-life nature of many of the episodes, I suppose it isn&#039;t really that surprising that a majority of the characters were very flat and that most of their substance was for entertainment value only. This is the most true for Hina Ichigo and Suisei Seki; the former is the most stereotypically &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; thing I&#039;ve ever seen, and the latter is just gimmicky (desu desu desu). Sousei Seki seemed to only exist for a (rather boring) subplot, and while she might be considered a foil for her sister, neither are really explored enough to matter. Nori was your typical older sibling character -- you know the type. She is 100% devoted to her brother and provides unconditional love and support, but isn&#039;t able to do much more than put up with his verbal abuse. Really, she just seems overly convenient; she is the character who can cook, clean, and run errands since there are no adults in the house (they just happen to be working overseas; yeah, sure). Generic support character is generic. Similarly, Sougintou was a cookie cutter villain. Seriously, everything from her design to her laugh to her evil grin seemed like a copypasta from every other generic villain in the world. Because nothing was explained until the last possible second, you have no real context for her antagonisms, and it was difficult to relate to either side of any fight. <br />
<br />
As the two protagonists, it makes sense that Shinku and Jun are the only characters in the entire series to have any real development. What was the most interesting to me was the gradual progression and development of their relationship throughout the course of the series, especially since it tied into both of their individual plotlines. Both of them grew, though Shinku had less room for change than Jun, and graduated to a higher level as people (or a doll) by the end of the series, which was possibly the only real good part of Rozen Maiden&#039;s conclusion. It was cute.<br />
<br />
ARTSTYLE &amp;amp; ANIMATION - It&#039;s obvious from the beginning the the artists spent a lot of time detailing all of the dolls&#039; lolita fashions. Each doll accurately represents a different kind of lolita, and they are all beautifully rendered. The human character designs are certainly plain in comparison, but they&#039;re only supposed to be ordinary school children anyway. The animation was good and smooth, but some background elements and special effects seemed a little cheap (the swirling clouds, for example). Overall though, Rozen Maiden was quite pleasing to the eye, and I&#039;m always impressed when there are characters so overloaded with minute details. It&#039;s one thing to have pimped out backgrounds; it&#039;s another thing entirely when they have to animate all the ruffles and ribbons on a character.<br />
<br />
MUSIC - I have a bias towards Ali Project. I love Ali Project. But really, I think the fancy, high-strung violins really suit the subject and style of Rozen Maiden. Classical elements are often associated with lolita, after all. The opening, &amp;quot;Kinjirareta Asobi,&amp;quot; is pretty typical Ali Project: high in anticipation and urgency, fast-paced while simultaneously beautiful and delicate sounding. The lyrics are actually pretty intriguing, but I&#039;m not sure how much relevancy they have to the series. The ending theme, &amp;quot;Tomei Shelter&amp;quot; by refio + Haruka Shimotsuki followed up each episode fairly well -- I&#039;m always a fan of the more energetic stuff first and the more mellow stuff second anyway. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack in the actual series seems to echo the style and mood of the opening, thus reminding me a lot of Yuki Kaijura&#039;s work even though she isn&#039;t the composer here. There were some very moving violin pieces throughout Rozen Maiden, and it&#039;s definitely a soundtrack I would recommend listening to beyond your viewing of the series. Then again, maybe I&#039;m just a sucker for violins and pianos and the classical junk. :P<br />
<br />
VOICE ACTING - Average, I&#039;d say, although... As much as I don&#039;t really like the character, I think Suisei Seki has a fun voice and her &amp;quot;-desu&amp;quot; on just about everything, while somewhat gimmicky and annoying, is actually pretty original. Certainly she isn&#039;t the first character to have words tacked on to almost everything (Chichiri&#039;s and Ryuichi&#039;s &amp;quot;no da&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;na no da&amp;quot; come to mind), but &amp;quot;-desu&amp;quot; is a first, and it&#039;s amusing because it&#039;s a grand exaggeration poking fun at the Japanese&#039;s own language, which yes, does make frequent use of &amp;quot;-desu.&amp;quot; Sousei Seki&#039;s &amp;quot;boku&amp;quot; isn&#039;t as prominient, probably because she doesn&#039;t speak nearly as much, but it&#039;s one of the reasons I&#039;d consider her a reverse-trap, a rare creature indeed. I find it interesting when characters&#039; verbal patterns dictate so much about them. It makes them more fun to listen to anyway, and both twins&#039; voice actors do a great job with them.<br />
<br />
Somewhat unrelated note: Hina Ichigo&#039;s cry for Shinku sounds exactly like Tian-Ze&#039;s cry for XingKe in Code Geass R2. That was so weird. D8<br />
<br />
OVERALL - Rozen Maiden was kind of disappointing when I consider the fanboyish recommendations that had been thrown at me by my brother, but that makes me wonder if my lack of interest is just rooted in the idea that this isn&#039;t really my genre. The actual story didn&#039;t make the grand delay in getting to it worth it, and the abundance of two-dimensional, uninteresting characters really dragged it down for me. The series never took the time to explain much of anything, and even now I have tons of questions, but I can&#039;t be bothered to really seek out answers to them because even they weren&#039;t all that interesting. But it was frustrating to know that they omitted so much when they spent so much time on completely pointless subplots (the quest for flower-topped hamburgers, for example). While I&#039;ll admit that it was kind of cute in the end, that cuteness didn&#039;t really make up for everything else I had to put up with. Maybe I&#039;m just utterly unaffected by the massive moe though. I&#039;m told the second season is much better, and maybe I&#039;ll get around to it eventually, but for now, I don&#039;t really feel that inclined.<br />

    Title: Rozen Maiden<br />
<br />
Manga, Anime: Rozen Maiden was originally a manga created by Peach-Pit (also well-known for the manga for DearS and Zombie-Loan), and began running in Monthly Comics Birz in September of 2002.  Chapters were released regularly up until March of this year, when it abruptly disappeared from the magazine.  No one&amp;rsquo;s quite sure what happened; the two main rumors are that the editorial department supposedly lost the chapter that Peach-Pit submitted, or that there was a disagreement between Peach-Pit and the editorial department.  Either way, the final installment showed up in the July issue, and was the cause of some controversy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review917">
        as it abruptly ended the story, but still left it open to continuation.  The manga consists of eight volumes, all of which have been released in Japan.  The manga was licensed by Tokyopop Stateside, and the fifth volume was released the same month that it ended its run in Japan (July 2007).<br />
<br />
The anime itself was done by Studio Nomad (well-known for their animation work on sola and Chocotto Sister) and directed by Kou Matsuo (well-known for directing Red Garden and his role as producer on Millenium Actress).  It ran from October 7th, 2004 to December 23rd, 2004 on TV in Japan.  Geneon has licensed it Stateside, and the third volume is due to be released next Tuesday (August 28th). <br />
<br />
Story: Jun, a rude little brat who refuses to go to school, much less out of the house, because of mental trauma, spends his days in his room ordering supernatural items over the internet, proving them false, and then sending them back before the return period expires.  His latest purchase turns out to be a doll named Shinku who comes to life when wound up, and is involved in a supernatural battle with other living dolls.  To that end, she needs a medium to draw power from.  Guess who the medium gets to be?  xD<br />
<br />
I have to give this show credit, though.  It has some of the most dislikable characters in the leads.  I mean, the one that I ended up liking the most and you feel most sympathetic to is the villain!  But they give reasons for it.  And most of the characters end up improving a little bit, so it&amp;rsquo;s not all that bad.<br />
<br />
The plot&amp;rsquo;s not especially remarkable.  But more on that later, in Length.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way?  The series so did not need the Shinku/Jun hints, kthnxbye.<br />
<br />
Art: It&amp;rsquo;s not anything to write home and gush about, but it&amp;rsquo;s not absolutely miserable, either.  No particular color scheme. CG and not-CG blends well.  So, for the most part, pretty standard.<br />
<br />
Music: ED and the background music for the series are pretty unremarkable.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably download the OST, though. <br />
<br />
But the OP is &amp;hearts;.  ALI Project for the WIN.<br />
<br />
Length: This is where the series has some issues, which tie into Story.<br />
<br />
The show has one of three categories that the episodes fall into: Filler, New Doll, or Alice Game.  And the thing is, the show brings up so many mysteries, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t even cover them all.  Most of the mysteries are still left hanging by the end of the series, and are shunted aside in favor of Filler, more often than not, which is disappointing.  At twelve episodes, it can&#039;t really afford it.<br />
<br />
Then again, there is a second season, and an OVA (not the one I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering further down).  So maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some hope.<br />
<br />
Seiyuu: Suigin Tou&amp;rsquo;s seiyuu is made of WIN.  Otherwise, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any problems/standout roles.<br />
<br />
Dub: N/A, haven&amp;rsquo;t bought the DVDs.<br />
<br />
Overall: Overall, this anime has some standout moments, but it has some issues.  Perhaps the OVA and second season can rectify those.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
Art: 8/10<br />

    Second Review from me, just made for fun because I&#039;m bad at writing them...<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A unique story which you will not find that fast. It&#039;s about Jun a boy who hase a fear for going to school, which becomes the servant of the beautiful living doll Shinku...<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Great and unique also art, the dolls are made with clothes you won&#039;t see mutch in other animes that&#039;s what making it special all over again...<br />
<br />
Sounds:<br />
Great voice actors, Shinku sounds like she needs to be just like all the other characters they really fit in. Also the opening and ending theme, Ali Project which is in my option one of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3037">
        the best ones where singing the opening theme and Haruka Shimotsuki, which I don&#039;t know very well the ending theme but it was still good...<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Jun is a boy who fears to go to school and doesn&#039;t wanna make allot contact, Shinku the doll who makes him her servant which is always ladylike, Suiseiseki the desu-one and the sister from Souseiseki, HinaIchigo the more little and hyper one, Souseiseki the serious one and sister from Suiseiseki and then we got at last Suigintou the more mysterious type and apears to be there enemy allot... all these characters are perfectly matching with how they look and how they are so this one is a big plus in my my eyes...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Even with the allot drama which is in it very mutch, people will enjoy this, also allot funny stuff is happening, I mean who doesn&#039;t enjoy a &amp;quot;weird so called now&amp;quot; living doll who lives with a boy... but as I said before it has pretty mutch sad things (more in the second season but this review is about the first one :P)<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I would recomend this really fast to people, before I thought it wasn&#039;t mutch special but after I watched I loved it so mutch which other people I guess also will^^

    One of the best animes ever done in my opinion. It contains a unique storyline and does exceptionally well in the character development department. When it tries to be cute and funny, it is cute and funny. When it tries to be serious, it&#039;s serious. Since it is first season of the series, it leaves just enough out to stir curiousity in people to encourage people to watch Traumend, the second season, and Ouverture, the story about Rozen Maiden&#039;s antagonist.

    Rozen Maiden is a gem lost in a world full of more known titles and will be if not yet a classic. While some of taken jabs at this series for not following the source material and being supposed lolibait, I for one must tell everyone that Rozen Maiden is NOT lolibait and sometimes seperating yourself from source material can work. True, it can be extremely risky and may very well end in complete failure as multiple mediums have proved that very thing, but what if the material is both good and really entertaining? Ladies and folks, you get Rozen Maiden.<br />
<br />
When I first started Rozen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170073">
        Maiden a few years back I in all honesty was not sure if it was my thing because up until late 2012 I was a heavy action and DBZ fan, but any doubt ended when got a few episodes in. Firstly, the story in itself is not completely unique to only Rozen Maiden and idea of being the last one of many standing exists in other titles such as Btooom and Zatch Bell, though judging from how Rozen Maiden operates I feel like the better comparison from the two is surely Zatch Bell. Quickly, enter Jun. Jun is a complete shut-in and has suffered trauma from negative experiences from kids at his school. I feel like middle schoolers or even high schoolers who have trouble fitting in with the society that is school can relate to the guy. I mean, who hasn&#039;t been bullied at least once? Continuing on, Jun has the hobby of ordering quite unusual stuff from the web and this is where the story begins to unfold as Jun is given a choice and that choice eventually will change his life as he must participate in the Alice Game and help his partner and blonde doll Shinku win the competition. <br />
<br />
You could say the art in Rozen Maiden is somewhat bland, but actually I disagree. While not on the level of the stunning EF: Memories, I really feel like it was good and fine as it was. Rozen Maiden from 2004 just didn&#039;t need all of that, though for 2004 I thought it looked mighty fine and appealing. Now, what about the sound? Firstly, both the dubs and subs rock so watch it as you please. Secondly, those openings really are extremely catchy. Are you a fan of the Another opening? Well, check out this tune then because its done by the same people.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden has a good story, appealing sound and look, but what about the characters? Are they worthy of a positive feedback? Well, that&#039;s the thing. Rozen Maiden&#039;s colorful set of characters ranging from Jun all the way to my personal favorite Suigintou really makes the anime great. It becomes a journey watching Jun mature, Shinku changing and even seeing Suigintou for who she truly is and was. This is anime at its finest and characters that are top notch. The character development that spans 26 episodes really does this anime justice. <br />
<br />
The enjoyment I got from Rozen Maiden was beyond words. Maybe it wasn&#039;t as soothing as Aria, as smart as Monogatari or as groundbreaking as Madoka Magica, but being smart or powerful doesn&#039;t always relate to enjoyment. Rozen Maiden proves just that.<br />
<br />
Overall? 10/10, easy. If you have yet to try Rozen Maiden due to the following reasons:<br />
<br />
- Looks like lolibait<br />
- 2004 seems old<br />
- Does not follow source material<br />
<br />
Please give it a chance. You may end up finding a gem hidden under your nose. I&#039;m done, make me some tea Jun.<br />
<br />

    Rozen Maiden was an anime I wanted to watch several years ago, but then since I wasn&#039;t able to get my hands on it for a very long time, and just like that, all my interest vanished. Until few days ago, upon seeing the list of upcoming anime this year, inexplicably Rozen Maiden is going to have it&#039;s third season aired around this year, simply named Rozen Maiden(2013) -  Interest regained. Anyway, putting that aside.<br />
<br />
Animated by studio Nomad,  a studio which is quite well-known and I&#039;ve seen some of their works back then, namely Kampfer and Ouran Highschool Host Club - though those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98805">
        two titles were not very outstanding, in my opinion. Rozen Maiden starts with a boy named Jun Sakurada who got his hands on a doll - Boy meets doll. Doll meets boy. Boy awakens doll. Doll abuses boy. Hilarity. First episode in and Rozen Maiden&#039;s core storyline is fairly hard to decipher. As the series progresses, the show gives vague explanation about the reason of the dolls&#039; or the so called &quot;Rozen Maidens&quot; existence, then finally unfolding it&#039;s actual plot, about halfway in the anime. Some of the characters had a habit of mentioning the name &quot;Alice Game&quot; without going into detail about what it actually is. The show also had a tendency of placing important pieces of the story in between some very filler-like episodes.<br />
<br />
While the filler episodes itself isn&#039;t that bad and it&#039;s watchable, since it&#039;s filled with solid comedy in them, but action scenes weren&#039;t epic. I&#039;ve seen action anime with more engaging and edge-of-the seat battles. Note that these are indeed living dolls; evident with the &quot;visible joints&quot; on their bodies and are brought to life with the help of magic, but they still have emotions, eat and drink like normal humans do. So, where does the all the food go to? No idea.<br />
<br />
The first and last few episodes, namely 1,2 ,3, 10,11 &amp; 12 - are probably the most enjoyment you can get out of this anime. Ending was decent, however, even after completing the series, the maker of the dolls still haven&#039;t been revealed, other than his name. Possibly in the next season....<br />
 <br />
Characters =<br />
-------------<br />
All scores are out of 5. Lowest 1 being hated. Highest being loved.<br />
<br />
Jun Sakurada:(1/5) Generic male protagonist no.2123. There&#039;s nothing special or interesting about him to play the role as the protagonist. Plain boring. He can be obnoxious too. <br />
<br />
Shinku:(3/5) Jun&#039;s Rozen Maiden and the fifth in the Rozen Maiden. Often abuses Jun physically and verbally. Somewhat of a Tsundere.<br />
<br />
Suigintou:(5/5) Perhaps the most renowned character in the series - stumbled upon many of her wallpapers/pictures/whatnot in websites and realized that it&#039;s was her. Suigintou is one of the few villains in anime that I like. The first and possibly the strongest among the Rozen Maidens. Sadistic, powerful, arrogant, beautiful, etc. Personal favourite in the whole series. Do want. As much as I love her as a character, but as the main antagonist, no. Her role as one is fair: she wants to be the winner of the Alice Game. She&#039;s also the type of antagonist who &quot;simply wanted to be loved.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suiseiseki:(3/5) A heterochromiac-desu. Just like Shinku, she often abuses Jun but mostly verbally-desu. But, she can be very adorable...only sometimes-desu. Can be a little bit irritating.<br />
<br />
Souseiseki:(4/5) Sister of Suiseiseki. More likable than her sister. Like Shinku, she&#039;s the more mature out of the group.<br />
<br />
Hana-Ichigo:(2/5) Noisy, spoilt, childish, etc. Do not want.<br />
<br />
Kashiwaba Tomoe:(3/5) Jun&#039;s classmate in school. Out of the other human characters, she&#039;s the only decent one. <br />
<br />
Nori Sakurada:(2/5) Jun&#039;s sister. Always forgot her name. Until writing this review...<br />
<br />
Character development is very weak. It&#039;s true that Jun Sakurada does become less of a hikikomori later on with the dolls&#039; help, but he&#039;s only shown some improvement and that&#039;s in the final episode.<br />
<br />
While the colors are not as bright and vivid as the newer anime and visuals for the human characters are very dated(obviously), on the other hand, the details for the &quot;Rozen Maidens&quot;, even now, still looks excellent, though clearly not on par when compared to the more recent anime. To sum up, the artstyle/visuals have both good and bad qualities. <br />
<br />
The vocalist for the opening theme is a very recognizable one. From her distinctive voice and the type of song she often sings, only few seconds listening to the OP, it was clear to me that ALI PROJECT was performing RM&#039;s Opening theme. Frankly, most of her songs don&#039;t appeal to me and same goes for this one too. Didn&#039;t bother listening to the Ending theme more than once. Just like the OP, the ED also does not appeal to me. Overall voice acting was great, though.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, RM has several faults however, the outcome was still fairly enjoyable. Slow pacing, bland protagonist, good-and-bad visuals are all redeemed by the first and last few episodes and lovable characters(apart from the protagonist). If you&#039;re planning to watch this anime, just don&#039;t expect too much out of it. Even with my mixed feelings(and slight disappointment) with this series, I&#039;ll continue to the second and third season, see how it fare.

    Rozen Maiden was originally an anime I very hesitant to pick up due to the genre of the anime and the premise of the show being talking dolls, but I am glad I gave it a shot despite it&#039;s evident flaws.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden was produced and released in late 2004 by Studio Nomad, which isn&#039;t a renowned company but has had successful shows such as OKHC (Ouran Kokou Host Club) and Kampfer. Not soon after it&#039;s release, the infamous &quot;Desu&quot; meme with Suiseiseki (It took me about 5 episodes to pronounce her name correctly) was created on 4Chan and the show became relatively popular ever since.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101857">
        All of that aside, let&#039;s move on to story.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The main plot of the story was hard to recognize at first, and not even present in episode 1, despite this the originality of the story was definitely refreshing. As the series progressed I came to realize what a simple story the anime had to begin with, and it seemed as if they were only using it as an excuse to initiate battle sequences or to progress character development (in which there was very little of) The mid part of the series felt like warm hearted comedy fillers, and had little or no relevance back to the real plot. The few battle scenes that were in the story weren&#039;t very suspenseful, and usually always between Shinku and Suigintou, with occasional assistance from the other dolls, making the whole &quot;action&quot; part of the series seem a bit monotonous, and out of place. One of the few things about the story that did have some merit was the concept of the &quot;Alice Game&quot; where the dolls have to fight each other and only the winner gets to meet the dolls father or &quot;Rozen.&quot; Even though on paper, that concept seems like a winner, the dolls involvement in the game was vaguely explained, and ironically the real story felt rushed being pushed out by the &quot;filler&quot; episodes for comedy. The anime attempted to be emotionally pulling on key points of the series, but I felt it wasn&#039;t very well executed or effective at all.<br />
<br />
Characters:7 <br />
For the most part, the characters of the series were quite enjoyable to watch with the exception of the main protagonist:Jun.<br />
<br />
Shinku: The fifth doll of the collection owned by Jun, who is also the main female protagonist of the series. Shinku is a lady like doll, who most reminds me of some sort of british nobility, and usually shows no emotion as to what she is doing making her a bit of a Tsundere. <br />
<br />
Jun: Typical hikikomori, nothing special here.<br />
<br />
Hina Ichigo: The sixth doll of the collection who is the embodiment of childishness, she frequently annoys all the dolls, and she is often perceived as the least favorite of the dolls in the series. <br />
<br />
Suiseiseki: &quot;Desu&quot; pretty much sums up this doll, her hatred for humans and her annoying nature to even the other dolls makes her more of the comedic element to the series along with Hina Ichigo.<br />
<br />
Souseiski: Suiseiseki&#039;s younger sister, who is a lot more likeable and mature than her sister.<br />
<br />
Suigintou: The sadistic, arrogant, and rather clever main antagonist of the series that is constantly terrorizing Shinku&#039;s group of maidens and Jun, in order to weaken her to steal her Rozen Mystica, her desperateness to win the Alice Game and evil nature makes her one of those likeable antagonists, despite what she is doing to the other dolls. <br />
<br />
Nori and Tomoe: Generic, happy go lucky girls, Nori takes care of Jun and the dolls and prepares all of the meals and tea. <br />
<br />
Character development was definitely not a strong point of the show, though it was present, but unfortunately not very effectively, as the only major character development in the series was in the final episode. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Despite being an older anime, the animation wasn&#039;t half bad, but is no where on par with today&#039;s standards. The small details that were included in the animation give it a boost. Though there were times where the animation was good and bad, so it was kind of a mixed feeling (That also describes the anime as a whole)!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I was actually quite fond of the opening song for the series, proper music was played during proper scenes, such as moments of battle, and sadness. Everything was appropriately placed sound-wise, though there were no songs that really stood out from the soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Closing thoughts:<br />
In conclusion, RM is definitely an enjoyable anime, despite it&#039;s flaws. Unfortunately, the anime only truly shines in the first few and last episodes of the series. This anime gave me mixed feelings throughout the entirety of the show, but the loveable characters and decent plot made up for it. <br />
<br />
Score Breakdown:<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
Animation: 7/10<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
My enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Final Score: 7/10<br />
<br />

    This is a story about dolls that must battle to become the perfect doll. Their creator was trying to create the perfect girl who I believe could be his daughter so he made the dolls to see who was the best. While most people would think that this concept is a lot like other shows where the girls fighting each other is only for the sake of a bit of fan service if a boob escapes their clothing, they are pretty much mistaken. In fact, there is barely any sort of fan service in the show besides maybe one point where the girls are in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187331">
        their undergarments while their clothing is being watched, but even that is rather modest. The dolls are not over sexualized. In fact, they all pretty much have the same body structure as that of a porcelain doll. When I first started watching this, it surprised me that the scenes were so subdued in that regard making it a bit high class slightly. It was a nice change.<br />
<br />
The characters are actually very loveable and all have personalities that make each one of them stand out. Jun I guess would be considered a normal anime boy character where he isn’t all that special on the outside. He had something bad happen in his life which made him shut himself in his house and act like a Neet, not really caring at all what his big sister tries to do to help him. Besides him being a Neet, he is very level headed though he buys a lot of supernatural items. I consider him level headed because he actually does know that must of the stuff he buys is junk but wants at least something exciting to happen if he ever ended up running into something that is a bit magical. It’s how he first got Shinku in fact. Shinku is actually a rather good match for him I think as she is also level headed and acts almost like the oldest sister to the other Rozen Maidens in the show. Looking up when she was made on the Wiki, she was the fifth Rozen Maiden and was after the twins but her soft nature to them and the way she is always trying to help them makes her a wonderful big sister character. On the other hand, she has a very high and mighty attitude in calling everyone around her servants and trying to make them do stuff for her. Not exactly sure how she got that but for the most part, I did notice she was doing so not out of being mean but out of trying to ‘teach’ them how to be fine young ladies… and in Jun’s case, gentlemen.<br />
<br />
The dolls having there own personalities and there own stories behind them make the show rather interesting. You can feel sorry for the girls and can understand their ups and downs just as you would with the human characters. One of the biggest parts of this show was about the flaws that we all have and how to try to find love even with those flaws. The characters are not all perfect girls with perfect personalities. Some are childish, others are needy, some have a habit of being rather high and mighty, but yet when it all boils down to is that they are all pretty much human. In the battle to find who would be the perfect ‘Alice,’ they have all pretty much become the perfect human. There many metaphors for the flaws within each other both in the dolls and in the human dreams that we sometimes see. It was one of the reasons why I actually had a deep feeling for the main antagonist, Suigintou. Suigintou’s story is actually a very big spoiler in the show but I can say that’s its extremely sad and made me understand part of why she acts the way she does. <br />
<br />
Sadly, most of the episodes play out more like a slice of life then a story about dolls fighting. There is barely any fighting that goes on in the show and a lot of learning about the characters and them running around the house. I think that was the largest flaw I found in this show. I wanted more of the supernatural aspect and more about the Alice Game and the story behind them rather then a whole slice of life. Still, it did help show the flaws in the characters and helped understand them as characters. I just wish they could of done both, the supernatural explaining and the character growth.<br />
<br />
The animation is rather nice when it wants to be, especially in the opening and closing. The problem I see though is that it feels like there are two different styles being used. One is a really normal anime style in the human characters and human world but then the dolls are designed perfectly to be in a very high detailed occult style show. The dolls are very detailed, and just looking at them you can tell what personality they have. Hinaichigo is rather cute with her pink outfit and childlike look, while as Shinku is rather high class and holds her self like that too. I know this may sound strange but it’s actually rather colorful in a dark way. There are times when they seem to cut corners during the more comedic parts and it actually made me feel awkward. I think that might have been the reason they did so but it is rather interesting. The colors are bright most of the time but even when they go into the occult areas, the colors are still rather powerful. The only times that they are dull is when it’s supposed to represent the area they are. <br />
<br />
The dubbing is actually rather good but some of the characters take some getting used to. A couple of them have rather high voices that at first made me want to cringe but after a while, they grew on me. Not to say they were good then, they just were decent. Two of the characters that kind of bothered me in their voices were Suiseiseki dubbed by Rebecca Forstadt and Hinaichigo voiced by Sherry Lynn. Both of them had such high voices that they threw me off a bit. I understand Hinaichigo being more of a child character and how her voice had to match but her crying and whining just made me annoyed. Suiseiseki on the other hand annoyed me on a different line with how snobby she acted and her voice being so high with it. As I said, they did grow on me but by then they were only decent and not as good as I could hope for. I fell in love with the opening song. It just had the perfect rush to get you into the show even if it didn’t match every part of the storyline.<br />
<br />
Overall, the show was actually well done and I did like the deep conversations and metaphors laced into the show. It made me think a bit about the psychology of the story. On the other hand, the voices and the strange art style were bit of a turn off. I still give this show a watch it because it was rather good.

    This review contains spoilers. I usually avoid putting spoilers in my reviews, but there is really so little to spoil here that I didn&#039;t feel like making the effort. Onward, then: <br />
<br />
I originally decided to watch Rozen Maiden because lots of people on a certain popular anime review site seemed to think it was great. After all the positive comments, I checked out the site&#039;s review of the series, and it was described as &#039;gothic horror&#039;, with advice to not be put off by the focus on dolls. Sadly, Rozen Maiden is in no way a horror, or even gothic (except for the clothing of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2215">
        the dolls, and I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to tell you that gothic costumes don&#039;t make for overall gothicness). The review was right about one thing, though: you shouldn&#039;t be put off by the fact that the series is about dolls. What should put you off is the actual characters of those dolls. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start with the good points: <br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden is reasonably pretty. The human characters seem to have been deprived of some attention on the design front, but at least Jun isn&#039;t a pretty boy. The dolls themselves are quite well designed and their costumes appear to have received more work than any other visual element. Also, Sinku&#039;s rose petal flurries are quite well done, looking both elegant and well animated. <br />
<br />
Aside from the visuals, the best feature of the whole thing is the villain of the piece, a larger, more powerful and more adult-looking doll called Suigintou. There isn&#039;t a whole lot of depth to Suigintou, but that&#039;s true of all the characters. The reason for her evil deeds only comes to light in the dying minutes of the final episode, and it&#039;s no great shock. Nonetheless, Suigintou serves her purpose in the plot well enough, and she has the honour of being the only character who didn&#039;t get on my nerves at any point (with the exception of Souseiseki, who didn&#039;t annoy me because she appeared late, said and did almost nothing, and was totally devoid of personality or distinguishing features. She could have been a chair for all the impression she made). <br />
<br />
That&#039;s all the good out of the way. Now onto the bad: <br />
<br />
The first and largest complaint I&#039;m going to make about this series is the characters. Oh god, the characters! In the very first episode, Jun, the &#039;hero&#039;, is revealed to be a self-centred, self-pitying layabout of a teenager, who makes his sister&#039;s life a misery by constantly ordering tat online and immediately making his long-suffering sibling take it to the post office so he can return it. You see, Jun doesn&#039;t leave the house. Not because he&#039;s ill or anything though. Oh no. He stays at home all day, every day, because he doesn&#039;t want to go to school. That&#039;s it. For no apparent reason, Jun and his sister (whose name eludes me) have absentee parents, so it&#039;s up to her to care for her brother. I&#039;d feel some sympathy for her plight, particularly in light of the way Jun treats her, if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that she&#039;s a simpering, spineless wuss. <br />
<br />
And we haven&#039;t even got to the dolls yet. The main doll, Sinku, initially earns some points from me by slapping Jun almost the instant she meets him. Unfortunately,despite her continuing to treat him roughly throughout the series, it&#039;s made very clear that she thinks he has some hidden quality inside that makes him a better person than everyone else. Ho hum. Other dolls proceed to arrive after Sinku, and they are all, frankly, rubbish. Every doll looks like a child (except Suigintou, who looks a bit more adolescent) but Hina is the most child-like of the lot - and not only in appearance. She is essentially a shrill brat. That&#039;s all you need to know about her, and indeed all there is to know. Suseiseki is alright at first, being aloof and detached from the others, but soon becomes something of a foil for Hina; she is just as childish as Hina, but tends to have opposing goals. As I mentioned above, Suseiseki&#039;s confusingly-monikered twin sister, Souseiseki, has no character and no personality, so let&#039;s skip her. There are various other dolls in existence, but none of them make an appearance. <br />
<br />
Now to the plot. The plot is, frankly, poor. In the first half a dozen episodes, there are occasional implications of a larger plot, with vague mentions of &#039;the Alice game&#039; and one or two menacing appearances by Suigintou, but that&#039;s all. Nothing much (aside from some irritatingly harem-comedy-esque incidents, which are disturbing since the dolls look like children and Hina in particular looks no older than five or six) happens until episode six, at which point Suigintou starts her kidnapping and attacks in earnest. This is not a good thing for a series that&#039;s twelve episodes long. The first half of the series is nothing but filler. Episode six may, in fact, be the best episode of the whole series - it manages to be reasonably enjoyable and not annoy too much. Once the plot does get going, still nothing much happens. Jun comes to realise that he cares about Sinku and the others, and discovers he&#039;s a git. Sinku vaguely owns up to holding Jun in some regard despite her rough treatment of him. And that&#039;s about it. Suigintou gets her comeuppance at Sinku&#039;s hands, but it&#039;s unsatisfying and pointless. Previously, Suigintou has been far more powerful than the other dolls, but suddenly Sinku is far more powerful than she is. The whole thing hinges on Jun&#039;s previously all but unmentioned sewing skill. Apparently his knack for sewing broken dolls back together makes Sinku strong enough to defeat Suigintou. Yes... The Alice game itself is never finished, and nothing much is resolved. Ho hum again. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll make a brief mention of the sound while I&#039;m here. I was actually quite excited about the music when I first started watching Rozen Maiden. The opening theme is annoying (though it becomes less so with time) but most of the incidental music has a faux-classical sound, which is nice. Unfortunately, the choice of music is usually at odds with whatever is going on in the series. Chamber-style classical music suggests an entirely different type of series. There is one piece of background music that tends to play whenever Sinku gets the upper hand in a battle with Suigintou, and that&#039;s actually quite good - a stirring little melody that reminds me of RPG boss fights, with soft rock guitar and drums overlaid by strings/string-like keyboards. I ended up watching battle scenes more than once, just to hear that tune. <br />
<br />
All in all, then, Rozen Maiden isn&#039;t really worth bothering with. The rating I gave it might confuse you now you&#039;ve read all my complaints, but the truth is Rozen Maiden isn&#039;t bad, as such - just weak. Simple, shallow, predictable plot that never goes anywhere; annoying characters; nice but inappropriate music... Episode six onwards is an average semi-action affair, enjoyable enough but nothing special; episodes one to five are filler. I hated the first half and didn&#039;t mind the second half, so I&#039;ve given it a six overall. Could be worse, could be a lot better.

    Rozen Maiden was the first anime I&#039;ve seen and it was the very reason I got into the medium. That&#039;s why this title is so special to me and because of that there might be some sentiment speaking through me. <br />
<br />
The main character of this story is Jun Sakurada, a shut in teenager, who lives apart from his parents, doesn&#039;t attend school and rarely ever goes out. He orders many extravagant things online and returns them before he has to pay for them. One day he receives a mysterious letter which he doesn&#039;t take seriously, and being asked whether he will &quot;wind or not&quot;, he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210374">
        agrees. As a result, he becomes the owner of a living doll, Shinku. (Or maybe it&#039;s Shinku that becomes his owner?)<br />
As the story goes on, more dolls are introduced and the reason behind them appearing is being unveiled. Long story short, the dolls are supposed to fight one another in order to decide which one is the closest to being the perfect doll their &#039;Father&#039;, the legendary doll maker Rozen seeks. <br />
<br />
In this first season of the Rozen Maiden anime, it&#039;s Jun&#039;s case that is the main focus. Partly because of that, the progress of the battle between dolls is slow. Personally, I found it a little disappointing that a lot of time is being spent on silly comedy / slice of life scenes of our main characters playing house. I can&#039;t help it but feel like some potential is being wasted. On the other hand though, thanks to those light hearted everyday scenes we get to know the characters better.<br />
The best point of this show is probably said character development, which is mostly noticeable in Jun&#039;s case. You might not like all of the dolls, even being a big fan of the story myself I didn&#039;t like them all either, but I still think they are good characters. There is some uniqueness to each of them. The first season doesn&#039;t introduce all of them, but the second season (which is a lot better imo) makes up for it and this is where the proper battle between them begins.<br />
The anime addresses some thought-provoking problems, like isolation, escapism or being unable to deal with a loss of someone important. Those motives are handled well, but like I said before, a feeling of wasted potential might be present sometimes.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden is a pretty old anime, so the art style is rather specific. There are many simplifications in the background, but generally it doesn&#039;t look bad. The character design is very good in the dolls&#039; case. There are many details and a lot of uniqueness. The animation quality is also fine. Overall, the art doesn&#039;t stand out but it&#039;s at least decent.<br />
The music on the other hand is very good. The soundtrack is unique and very fitting to the series&#039; climate. The opening song is sung by my beloved Ali Project and sounds very typical of them, but also fits the anime. The ending song, &quot;Toumei Shelter&quot; by Kukui is a calm, nice song.<br />
<br />
Even though Rozen Maiden isn&#039;t flawless, it&#039;s a well done show that might be more than it seems to be. In spite of some flaws, it&#039;s for sure an unique anime that is worth giving a try. These 12 episodes aren&#039;t that much time and you might find yourself charmed by this magical, fairytale-like story. In my case, this is the show that will always have a special place in my heart, even if I can&#039;t say it&#039;s the best thing I&#039;ve seen.<br />
I&#039;m giving it a solid 7.

    Keeping this review simple, this is my favorite anime out of my anime list. I shall split this review into each catergory.<br />
<br />
Storyline: The story is very interesting. The concept of dolls fighting is an interesting one which has sparked interest all over the world.<br />
<br />
Art: The art is very bright and cheerful at times however at times when needed, can change to the dark and gloomy theme effectively as well when needed. No complaints over this.<br />
<br />
Sound: There is a very diverse soundtrack with Rozen Maiden however there is one or two events where other songs in the soundtrack could have been used.<br />
<br />
Character: There are a wide

          <span style="display: none;" id="review882">
        variety of characters in the anime that have different personalities. Such characters have become some of my favorite out of any show. Especially Suiseseki who is famous for her &amp;quot;-desu&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 110% satisfaction!<br />
<br />
Overall: A flawless anime which is definitely deserving of at the very least, an attempt at watching.

    Rozen Maiden, an anime that can have drama, action and comedy all in perfect harmony.<br />
<br />
The anime revolves around a creator of dolls created a legendary collection of 7 living dolls, called &quot;Rozen Maiden&quot;, he puts them in a game, in order to know which doll is worthy of becoming &quot;Alice&quot; the perfect girl. The story follows Jun, a hikikimori which has a school trauma and accidentally becomes master of the fifth doll, Shinku.<br />
<br />
The anime has a melancholy and mysterious air, this can be seen mainly in the opening of the anime and in his scenarios. It has a very interesting story and endearing characters.<br />
Something very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189533">
        interesting in this anime is that the author did a story with a boy as protagonist surrounded dolls, breaking the stereotype that only girls should be involved with dolls without this seems strange. It&#039;s that kind of anime that even when not focused on the plot can arrest you with comic situations. <br />
<br />
It is not very faithful to the manga, and unfortunately the features of some characters have been modified: Shinku in the manga is not as serious as this anime, the same thing with Suigintou doll, which in the manga makes many sarcastic jokes, but in the anime is more serious. The Jun sister also makes many jokes about puberty, but in the anime it is virtually nonexistent. Even with these differences, the anime still manages to get the main ideas of the plot.<br />
<br />
During the anime we can see the evolution of the protagonist in relation to their trauma, and even over the characters, like his sister and dolls, in which he did not get along very well.<br />
<br />
The only thing I think was missing in anime, that was not much talked about the creator of Rozen Maiden, nor how he did it and what were his exact reasons for this. In the manga it has been said more clearly, but in the anime it has gone a bit unnoticed.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for something different, with comedy and a bit of drama, Rozen Maiden is a good choice.

    Exciting, Heartbreaking, Heartwarming, Adorable, Dolls..? Fun.<br />
<br />
A simple anime series, yet quite satisfying all around. Rozen maiden dolls, simply put, a group of dolls that are wound by hand by use of a special key.<br />
<br />
At first I was afraid watching this anime. I thought it&#039;s some childish doll kind of story. Well, it turns out..not! Shinju, Kanaria, Ichigo, and the other six Rozen-Maiden dolls was made by Rozen. He was a maestro in doll-craft. All the dolls love him, but they have to fight one another to become &quot;Alice&quot;-a symbol of a perfect woman that Rozen always dreamt of. Through each seasons they (and us) will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174183">
        learn the importance of significant others, bonds between sisters, how great a daughter could long to see her father, what is the real beauty, and the most important is...how to rise after you fall. This is a very nice, touching, yet a simple story with a dash of action :)

    Rozen Maiden, how I love thee.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I adored this anime more than any other that I&#039;ve watched. I laughed, and during the last two or so episodes, I cried. I couldn&#039;t help it, it was all so touching!<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10. It&#039;s kind of cliche, with the kid getting teased and stuff and going into hiding, but living dolls that help? That&#039;s pretty unique. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10 Oh my goddd, I love this art. Bright and cheerful when needed, but also dark and stormy when the time is right. I do adore the outfits for the dolls, and would even wear them! The doll&#039;s eyes-- especially Shinku&#039;s--

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26245">
        held so much emotion that it was almost heartbreaking. The only problem I had were the hairstyles for Jun and his sister. I didn&#039;t like them at all.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 The voices for the characters were very fitting. Even Suiseiseki, who was shy at times, had the perfect evil, sadistic laugh for the Snow White &quot;rehearsal.&quot; The opening song is very cheerful and it allows the viewer to get into a peaceful mindset.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10. I loved every character, even when they irritated me. Shinku irritated me the most though but she definitely grew on me. Same with Hina Ichigo, the annoying four-year-old-appearing doll.. Her voice was just so highpitched [very suiting though, for her age]. All of the characters had their flaws yes, but that&#039;s what made them more realistic. I even felt sorry for Suigintou at the end! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10. I couldn&#039;t wait to watch the next episodes, and since I was watching this on megavideo, I growled at the &quot;You have watched 72 minutes....&quot; popup, and made Google be my slave trying to find other places to watch it. I am going to buy this on DVD as soon as I can, for sure.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10. If you&#039;re looking for something bright and cheery, but still carrying dark undertones, Rozen Maiden is definitely the anime for you. It has its moments of boredom, but what show doesn&#039;t? But even despite that, it picks back up immediately.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Recommendation? Oh yes, even for people who don&#039;t like Shoujo anime, I would definitely recommend Rozen Maiden to them. <br />
<br />
Rewatch? As many times as I can. Like I said, I&#039;m buying the DVD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go watch, you won&#039;t regret it.

    This an anime that should be appreciated by those who fond of anime. It shows a different side and genre of anime. Full of surprises, emotion and humorous. Rozen Maiden also define the actual meaning of drawing with details. Every inch and waves draws perfectly nice and satisfying your hunger for anime&#039;s art remedy. It also shows a variation in plotting an anime&#039;s series. Story stirring about :<br />
<br />
-Bonds of friendship and among siblings. [Main]<br />
-Each person have different characteristics that give our life more colorful even sometimes giving us much pressure.<br />
-Treasure our happiness without being lonely and felt imperfect. <br />
<br />
Sure does this anime rocks, colorful and

    When I first saw this anime I thought: &#039;looks quite scary!&#039; <br />
But you get over that.<br />
After the first episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can like Rozen Maiden for just the basic plot line in itself, which is simply unique. However those who can decipher another meaning will notice how it could symbolize how women and girls today are made to think they can reach perfection, and should do so to please others. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
If you like your sinister anime, this is for you. Though of course; it&#039;s not all sinister. There are funny parts to balance it out. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is lovely, and matches the theme well.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I love the BGM

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9680">
        ^ ^ it&#039;s amazing, and adds a sinister air, tension or a jolly *feel*.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The characters are, by far, some of the most developed in my opinion. <br />
The first-vengeful,slightly depressed,lonely.<br />
The second-jolly,bossy,has a large ego.<br />
The third-loud,cheeky,bossy.<br />
The fourth-quiet,caring,thoughtful,wise.<br />
The fifth-bossy,commanding,sensitive.<br />
The sixth-cute,happy-go-lucky,charming.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s a beautiful anime. I&#039;d suggest it to anyone ^ ^

    Story (7.0) - The plot is not bad, but its nothing great..<br />
The story of this anime tells us about a boy, Jun, who is different from normal boys, since he has a lot of fears and dont face them...as a result, he ends up spending most of his time at home, not going to school. But one day, a doll appears on his life - shinku...who is a special doll, involved in a special war with other living dolls. From that moment, jun life will change ...<br />
Nothing great..story is very cliche, not very original .... just a 7 in here.<br />
<br />
Art (7.3) - This aspect is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6158">
        what i would say acceptable. Is neither bad or amazing...There are some parts where the design is good, in other situations are not so good, the animations are just enough for give some credit to the anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (7.5)  - Background music is not something really great...the ed and op are just enough not to ruin the anime.. the voices are ok.. again, i would say this is in the average, i&amp;acute;ve seen much worse and also much better.<br />
<br />
Character (7.5) - Again, this aspect is only average. however, i have something to say here..The main characters, especially shinku and jun are something that definetively didnt catch my attention, however, I ended up sympathizing with the villain, Suigintou, since in my opinion she was the one that gave more interest to this show. Suiseiseki also got some of my attention, but from this anime my favourite is for sure Suigintou. <br />
Not all characthers are equally develloped, some of them lack devellopment and more protagonism in the series. But i give an 8 in here.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7.0) - Some action, some funny parts, however, the story is too cliche as i said before. Some parts got some of my attention, others almost made me quit, well, but i cant consider it bad. a 7 here.<br />
<br />
Overall (7.0) - This is what i call just an average anime.. Its nothing that really got me interested, the only nice thing i take from this one is maybe the fact that Suigintou is one characther i liked, but not much more than that. Not an anime i would strongly recommend.. <br />
<br />

    There are probably not many who actually DON&#039;T know of the Rozen Maiden series, even if they haven&#039;t watched it, there is no way they could actually not know about it, because of its popularity and &#039;Lolita&#039; styled characters. I always feel awkward when I watch popular anime, probably because I feel like some sort of brainless, chatspeaking weaboo.<br />
<br />
(I actually had to delete a huge chunk that was just a rant about the lack of decent local anime fans who aren&#039;t weeaboos, where I live. I should be shot sometimes, when I go off topic. Such a bad habit.)<br />
<br />
STORY: Series that have that servant/master, fighter/user,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27371">
        etc thing going on, like Loveless, tend to make me want to smash my head against something. Freak sakes, they&#039;re so unoriginal and boring. There is just something so lame about them. I guess the plot is a little cliche; one bad guy, good guys need to defeat them, main good guy is the one who defeats bad guy, with the help of the &#039;fighter&#039;. It felt like there was no depth in the story whatsoever. The only good thing about Rozen Maiden, is that the humourous atmosphere created by the characters makes up for the fighter/user theme.<br />
<br />
ART: Peach-Pit is (apparently) well known for their splendid art, which I happened to see for the first time in Ookamikakushi. The design, in both, are good, but, nothing really to get excited over. Peach-Pit definitely is the best for character designs for dolls/doll-like characters though. A lot of effort has been put into the designs for the dolls, but I feel that the human characters had been left out, because they look so... plain. As for Jun and Nori (particularly Jun), they look like they&#039;re supposed to be out of something silly like Digimon or Beyblade. Actually, Jun reminds me of Hiroshi out of Ookamikakushi, which I thought was ironic. Even their seiyuus almost sound the same. As for animation... animation was good, no more no less. It was clean, so no complaints.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Sound was pretty good. I adore the Victiorian instruments like the harpsichord, mixed with violins and such, because of my love for Emilie Autumn. Sorry I can&#039;t expand much on this.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: The real charm out of the anime. You really can&#039;t not love the dolls. Each one has their own individual personality/traits, yet all of them are naive, to the point where they all act like young children despite how elegant they look, including Shinku. I hate children, but even I would love to have the around the house.<br />
<br />
Overall, pretty happy about series. Even if the story was perhaps a little bland, the characters and art helped me overlooked that, and give a final score of 7. I&#039;d even be tempted to by the DAL/Pullip/Blythe Rozen Maiden dolls and the DVDs after watching this.<br />
<br />

    Without a doubt this is a series that is not for all taste. I&#039;ll make it known right now. If your anime must be of the same breed as Ninja Scroll, Godannar, Burst Angel, or even Ghost in the Shell. Then there is nothing here for you because Rozen Maiden is not a very dark or heavily action driven show in the first place. I will say it more than resembles and blends Angelic Layer and Azumanga Daioh. This is due to its style concerning cute characters, fighting dolls, some drama, and over the top comedy. There are action scenes present but this is clearly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184107">
        not the selling point.<br />
<br />
At its core, Rozen Maiden is mainly character driven. Several more dolls soon appear with each having their own distinct personality. There are plenty of characters with each of them given a good amount of time to develop. The character development is very strong by giving viewers a chance to choose which character can be a favorite. This is done through the exceptional writing, which provides the characters with very real and down to earth emotions. To include, the great voice work for both languages brings out their appeal.<br />
<br />
There happens to be two plots taking place during a stand alone episodic format. This is actually where one of my cons concerning pacing issues will be addressed. One of the plots takes place with the origin and purpose of &quot;The Alice Game&quot;. This game is a one on one battle between each of the dolls for their Rosa Mystica. The loser will become a regular doll, therefore, being robbed of all life. The victor will come closer to becoming &quot;Alice&quot;, which happens to be the perfect being in order to meet their &quot;father&quot;.<br />
<br />
The lead villain named Suigintou is determined to win the game by any means necessary. Her first conflict with the other dolls will grasp the attention of the action fan. This plot may seem to be dropped, but it&#039;s woven together with some of the stand alone episodes as well as the secondary plot. The secondary plot deals with the dolls helping Jun break away from his solitude. This is where I believe serious action oriented fans may either hate this series, or not really care for it because the minor pacing issue can have a negative effect; but if the viewer prefers character driven stories and is already sold on the characters, especially after that over the top comedic episode five. Then getting through the rest of the series will be easy since it really does end strong in my view.<br />
<br />
Rozen Maiden does touch on certain themes. I also feel they&#039;re tied up pretty well. Several questions are answered but not fully, and they&#039;re only answered to the point where they make sense but also adds to the mystery. All depending on the viewers taste concerning Japanese comedy. The comedy can be hilarious or annoying. I found a majority of it to hit the right mark. Most notably for me in the dialogue. Some of the characters use very mild foul language, but I don&#039;t consider it to be real potty mouth.<br />
<br />
The character designs are gorgeous for each of the dolls, even for the dark character of Suigintou with the colors of their dresses displaying their personalities to some degree. I also liked the backgrounds and artwork for Suigintou&#039;s dark dimension which is littered with destroyed toys. However, it is inconsistent because sometimes the dolls appear to be a different height which happens to be very noticeable. The animation overall is very clean and fluid during the battles. This also goes for small details such as facial and eye movments. The soundtrack has a nice melody that accurately captures the moment each time with some nice violin pieces. The standout song for me is by far the ending theme called Tuomei Shelter.<br />
<br />
This first season ends on a strong note, and in the process almost makes the second season Rozen Maiden: Traumend a must see if you&#039;re already sold on the characters. Unfortunately, the second season isn&#039;t as strong as its predecessor.<br />
<br />
Pros: Character development &amp; good interactions, beautiful character designs<br />
<br />
Cons: Inconsistent animation, comedy and style will not appeal to everyone, minor pacing issues
