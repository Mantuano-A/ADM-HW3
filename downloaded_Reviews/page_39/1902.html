    After seeing the trailer for this movie nearly a year ago, I&#039;ll be honest and say I thought it looked really awesome! It seemed like a great idea for a Naruto movie! Now, I&#039;ve seen the long awaited Naruto Movie 4 The Lost Tower, and I am, to say the least, very disappointed with it.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t the worst Naruto movie I&#039;ve seen, but it was the one that I was most excited about and that&#039;s what bothers me the most. <br />
Here is what I thought of it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
From the trailer and the description, I thought for sure that this movie would be about Naruto going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36663">
        into the past and meeting his dad and they would have a father-son sort of bonding (without knowing that they were related). I wanted to see Minato and Naruto as the main focus of the movie. And what do I get? All together, Minato showed up in the movie for about 10 minutes. I wouldn&#039;t even consider him a main character. Instead of Minato taking up the spotlight, we meet a new character named Sara. The only good parts of the movie were when Minato was there; in other words, there were only about 10 minutes of the movie that I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Focusing on other details - In the first few seconds, this movie starts off with a fight that includes Naruto, Sakura, Sai and Kakashi. I&#039;ll admit, it was a decent fight to catch the audience&#039;s attention. But after, it basically went downhill. <br />
The first ten minutes of the movie do a quick intro to what will happen throughout the film, but those ten or so minutes were definitely not enough! Everything was extremely fast paced, especially at the beginning. There were also several gaps in the plot that made me wonder if I had missed something. That alone just spells doom for the rest of the film. The plot doesn&#039;t matter because it wasn&#039;t any good, the only decent parts were the fighting, and even then, it wasn&#039;t incredible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The art in The Lost Tower wasn&#039;t terrible, but the characters didn&#039;t have all that many details, just average anime art. <br />
The background on the other hand was very beautiful and nicely detailed! During this movie, we see many buildings and sky-scraping towers. I feel like the majority of the budget for this movie went to making the background pretty. But most people focus on the characters rather than the objects behind them.<br />
<br />
Something that bugged me a little bit was the random and most ridiculous faces or body-twists that Naruto has ever made. I have never really seen his face distort like that in the show. This little addition made it similar to One Piece expressions (as in, the eyes grow extremely wide and the mouth extends longer than is humanly possible). I am aware that anime doesn&#039;t follow the laws of physics, but in previous naruto movies and the show, they have kept things relatively realistic. But like I mentioned, it only bothered me a little bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Junko Takeuchi is a great voice actress! She is able to voice emotions very well and that&#039;s part of what makes Naruto&#039;s character interesting and fun. So I don&#039;t have anything bad to say about her.<br />
<br />
Toshiyuki Morikawa voices Minato Namikaze in The Lost Tower. He is also a very talented voice actor and I think the creators would have been smart to include Minato in the movie more and by doing that, give Toshiyuki Morikawa more time to talk!<br />
<br />
Saori Hayami is the voice of the new character Sara (or Saara) in this movie. She isn&#039;t a terrible voice actress, but nothing about her stood out to me. Rather than being emotional and dedicated to the voice, she sounded a bit too scripted. <br />
<br />
The music in the Lost Tower was decent enough. The only song that stood out to me though was the ending fight song! The other songs used in the movie just seemed like background noise that nobody thinks twice about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
Naruto - for some reason, I felt like Naruto was acting too childish. Remember Naruto from the first series where he complains and whines a lot? That&#039;s what he acted like. The Naruto in Naruto Shippuuden is more mature (in some ways) and a bit more calm. I think the writers would have done better to have Naruto more cool-headed and rational.<br />
<br />
Minato - as I have said a couple times, he is NOT a main character in this movie. So I am not able to talk much about him. But from what I saw, he is how I would picture him to act. <br />
<br />
Sara - We always need a &quot;Damsel in Distress&quot; right? That&#039;s basically all Sara does in this movie. She tries to help several times, but really doesn&#039;t do much. She got a much larger part in the movie than I would have preferred.<br />
<br />
Kakashi - in this movie, we get to see young Kakashi. However, we see him even less than Minato. He wasn&#039;t really even necessary for this movie. I love Kakashi and I really wanted him to be more involved! I would have loved to see his young self fight alongside Minato and Naruto. But sadly, all he really did was take up screen space.<br />
<br />
Mukade - Can I even put this guy into a &quot;villain&quot; category? He really wasn&#039;t a very intimidating bad guy. I could hardly even remember his name. His goals weren&#039;t impressive and his actions were, to be honest, boring. &quot;Madara&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot; or &quot;Orochimaru&quot; are names that people can remember because the characters DID something worth remembering. Mukade doesn&#039;t even come close to a decent villain. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
Definitely not a movie that I would want to go buy or even watch again. For that entire 1 hour and 25 minutes, I was waiting for something epic to happen, but nothing did. <br />
My &#039;enjoyment&#039; is often based on the Story and Character, and after giving those low scores, you can imagine that my enjoyment was also relatively low.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
I really wish I could give this a better score. But I felt the need to be harshly honest about this movie. I didn&#039;t like it, it was a disappointment in every way possible. <br />
I can only hope that the next Naruto movie is better written than this one.<br />

    It is a sad day in the forest when a kid can&#039;t recognize his own father who looks EXACTLY like him when he has outrageously yellow, spiked hair just like him. This is the tale of Naruto and the Lost Tower in a nutshell.<br />
*Note: This review may include a few spoilers.<br />
<br />
Story (1/10):<br />
The plot makes absolutely no sense and has little purpose other than for Naruto to meet his father and completely misunderstand it, as his head is too thick to even consider the fact that the guy with the exact same haircut gave him his gene pool. I&#039;m only going to assume that this plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186230">
        takes place before Naruto knows that the fourth Hokage was his dad because he did manage to piece that together, but nothing else. <br />
Another thing he obviously couldn&#039;t figure out was that the girl he meets back in the present at the ruins of the tower is the daughter of the princess he&#039;d met in the past. She is also an obvious reincarnation that Naruto never pieced together and the third strike against him is that I&#039;m not even sure if he recognized Kakashi, who appears to him as a child (also looking no different than present-day Kakashi).<br />
My only conclusion is that Naruto has Capygras syndrome or suffers from severe retardation.<br />
<br />
Art (5/10):<br />
Overall, the art isn&#039;t bad. The animation is fluid and there are some pretty good effects added. The fights did get somewhat boring by the end as they followed the same shounen guideline of &quot;get your ass kicked until the very last second in which we FINALLY turn the tables because our time is up&quot;. <br />
<br />
Sound (4/10):<br />
During a lot of the action scenes the sound effects overrided what little voice was going on at the same time. The only good thing about their sound was Toshiyuki Morikawa, and that is only in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Character (1/10):<br />
No character development what-so-ever. The princess (female lead) is your generic kind of girl who dislikes Naruto so far as to slap him several times after saving her life in the beginning to promising to never forget their encounter and telling him about how he changed her life at the end. Also, she has a daughter who meets Naruto and briefly and obviously talks about Princess Sara for the audience to realize who her mother was. Their designs aren&#039;t creative because they both look like Karen without her glasses.<br />
Also, the villian is your typical &quot;I will destroy the world and you can&#039;t stop me until the end&quot; kind of character, and about 80% of his script includes screaming &quot;Sara!&quot; (the princess), 15% includes monologues of taking over the universe or about being invincible, and the last 5% is miscellaneous crap that isn&#039;t even noteworthy.<br />
As I raged about earlier, my other criticism was how Naruto can&#039;t recognize even the most obvious of obvious.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (2/10):<br />
By 10 minutes through the movie I was constantly checking the timer to see how much longer this torture would go on and I was constantly face palming at everything Naruto didn&#039;t notice, which was EVERYTHING. The only reason it didn&#039;t get a one out of ten is, again, because Toshiyuki Morikawa is one of my favorite voice actors AND lucky for Naruto, I have seen many an anime that exceeds even this poor quality in terms of crappiness.<br />
<br />
Overall: (3/10)<br />
A complete waste of 85 minutes, 40 of which were spent defeating the bad guy. I don&#039;t recommend it to even the biggest of Naruto fans. To be honest, this movie wasn&#039;t much different than the plot and cast from the first Shippuden movie.

    Naruto Shippuden: Lost Tower Movie Review<br />
<br />
**WARNING SOME SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Oh how I hate trailers, well actually I’ve come to hate them, I use to enjoy watching movie trailers now I can only watch them with a skeptical and critical eye. They’re deceiving and often times will regurgitate the best scenes in one mash up with dramatic background music: it’ll get the audience intrigued and excited. Lost Tower followed the same routine.<br />
<br />
The movie trailer truly looked exciting, while I have seen the past Naruto movies – a few being quite disappointing – I was crossing my fingers for this one. I saw the trailer and had a fangirl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36754">
        moment once I saw a glimpse of the Fourth Hokage and a chibi Kakashi: it had time travel written all over it. I was so excited at the prospected that for a year I patiently waited, imagining how epic this movie was going to be.<br />
<br />
Once I was finally able to get my hands on a subbed version I eagerly started watching it.<br />
<br />
The beginning was nothing special, if anything it felt rushed as it tried to cram whatever nonsensical explanation the plot needed to get it going: this happened in the short span of 5-10 minutes; but I didn’t let it deter me from the rest of the movie.<br />
<br />
Finally after a cliché opening Naruto is thrown into the past, this is where the excitement and adventure begins. Sadly it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
For a movie that showcases team seven with Yamato in the beginning we only get Naruto thrown in the past with Yamato, and Yamato is only shown for a few minutes. So that was one big glaring disappointment, but I was hoping that would mean the story would concentrate on Naruto and Minato... well to disappoint all of the Minato fans the movie zeros in on Naruto and some new princess; Minato is left in the dust. Yah.<br />
<br />
So Lost Tower falls into the predictable niche with its routine formula – Princess, Villain and Hero - with under developed princess and villain, forgotten side-characters and boring plot.<br />
<br />
We&#039;ll start with the Princess, how I detest this character. Sara is another unlikeable and one-dimensional damsel in distress who has a creepy resemblance to Kushina. She&#039;s naive, arrogant and likes feeling sorry for herself. Obviously there&#039;s a plot, coup d&#039;état would be an inappropriate word for such a movie, against her and she is obviously saved by Naruto. Then it&#039;s her boring adventure of self-discovery and it comes to the predictable climax of self-epiphany.<br />
I don’t know why they can’t have a movie with no new helpless character, simply the same old people in a crisis trying to fight a villain (I suppose don’t mind new villains).<br />
<br />
The Villain, Mukade, is the usual crazy type that wants to rule the world and gain copious amount of power. He somehow gains incredible regenerative abilities, incredible puppet technique that allows him to control an army of puppets and of course he has unlimited amount chakra so he never tires out. Really this amount of power, despite his physical weakness, would put Sasori, another legendary ventriloquist, to shame and Sasori was awesome and at least had a back story. Not much is known about Mukade beside the fact that he&#039;s a power hungry a-hole. He&#039;s a forgettable villain that makes you wonder how he can have so much power.<br />
<br />
The Hero, well Naruto is Naruto. Typical speeches, absentmindedness, predictable jutsus and saves the day. Nothing new really in that department except I will point out how immature and childish he was, we all know Naruto isn&#039;t necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box but in Shippuden he had at least matured somewhat and calmed down since his &#039;genin&#039; days. It seems like the producers decided to revert his personality and made Naruto so goofy and inattentive.<br />
<br />
Now this might seem typical to a Naruto movie, but the whole package came apart and it failed to deliver. Too many transitional scenes, plot holes and not enough explanation adds to the many other lacking aspects of the movie.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should explain in more detail why this movie totally sucked:<br />
<br />
One big thing that took away from the movie were the boring fight scenes. This is a shonen series about shinobi&#039;s, I&#039;m expecting some kick-ass action, instead Naruto is tossed around like a rag-doll and uses the same two jutsus: rasengan and bunshin, over and over again never deviating to anything else and he gets his ass handed to him. At least in the series he tries to use deception; and he has other jutsus that he doesn’t bother to use: Odama Rasengan, summoning or shadow shuriken technique. He uses the Rasenshuriken once but it’s easily overcome by the villains ‘godly’ powers, so it’s another bust in the jutsu and excitement category.<br />
<br />
Then there’s this chakra blade business that was ridiculous to watch, another excuse to introduce a new and useless power that Naruto will never use beyond this movie. Naruto looked awkward wielding the blade, he could have used a simple kunai. They should have incorporated some nine-tail action or sage mode (although apparently this takes place before he goes to Mount Myoboku, so he wouldn’t know sage jutsu. They should have moved the timeline after the Pein Arc). The only nine-tail power we see is Naruto using some of its chakra to overwhelm the villain but that was poorly done – usually Naruto’s eyes would have turned red, his nail would grown longer and sharper, and his whisker marks would have widen and thicken, in the movie all aspects were absent.<br />
<br />
I’m not even going to talk about Supreme [Lame] Ultimate Rasengan , the name says enough.<br />
<br />
Then enters Minato who always saves Naruto in the nick of time, teasing the audience with a few neat parlour tricks and making us want to see him in full action, the only thing he seems to enjoy doing is talking cryptically and disappearing. The scenes he’s in usually goes along like this: he utters Naruto’s name, asks if he’s alright, tells him to protect the princess and then subsequently disappears to who-knows-where for the next 15 minutes. He never really explains his mission or how it correlates with the current events. Heck we see his two team members, Chouza and Shibi, do more fighting.<br />
<br />
And since when does Naruto immediately obey any order? I don’t care if that was their way to ‘subtlety’ wink at the whole father/son bond, Naruto wouldn’t have easily obeyed Minato without an argument or disobedience, father or not.<br />
<br />
The movie had so much potential that was wasted on repeated jutsus, boring dialogue, and failed fighting scenes.<br />
<br />
The movie is extremely lame and boring, I feel disappointed. This has a ‘filler’ feel to it: annoying and naïve damsel that gets saved by Naruto and is subject to Naruto’s many speeches; uninteresting and overpowered villain that is subsequently defeated by a cliché new rasengan created at the last moment; important and powerful characters (Minato, Kakashi, Yamato) only show up at the last minute and disappears when most needed.<br />
<br />
This is what I was hoping to get out of this movie:<br />
<br />
<br />
    • Have Sakura, Yamato, Sai and Naruto all thrown into the past;<br />
    • More scenes and interaction between Naruto and Minato – so more tag teaming;<br />
    • No cliché princess or new female character that shows subtle feeling towards Naruto near the end (and has an epiphany thanks to Naruto’s speech-no-jutsu);<br />
    • Kick-ass fighting: collaboration fighting with Sakura, Sai, Yamato, Naruto, and Minato. And Naruto actually showing his true fighting potential and not this BS that was spewed to us, Naruto can do better, this is Shippuden;<br />
    • Minato and Naruto bonding in an indirect way (the movie attempted to do this but failed miserably), so through tag teaming, good dialogue (banter, imitation, avoidance of revealing future yet it accidently slips little by little);<br />
    • More scenes with Minato in it! Seriously I thought he was going to be a main character, I mean he’s even on the poster! He’s hardly in the movie and enjoys disappearing when he’s actually needed;<br />
    • See more of chibi Kakashi, that was seriously a tease he only gets a small cameo, what was even the point in having him there;<br />
    • Naruto learning more about Minato and Minato passes on some good wisdom/advice.<br />
<br />
Of course there’s none of that, or little itty bitty hints to tease the audience with – cruel movie producers. I can only hope Bloody Prison will be better, but then again trailers are misleading.

    Compared to the other movies, this one wasn&#039;t that good. I mean, as a movie or time killer its fine but it&#039;s nothing to get hyped up over. As usual Naruto being the main character runs around doing things his way like in every other movie. Theres nothing new here. Also the main female is NOT Naruto&#039;s mom. Naruto&#039;s mother&#039;s name is Kushina. This lady is Sara. They just look alike.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The concept of time travel is interesting itself. I mean, Naruto going back into time to meet Minato and a few others? Who wouldn&#039;t want to see that?. Unfortunately this hope was dropped a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36529">
        little (tell you why soon) and is why it fell short of 8 for me.<br />
<br />
This &quot;present&quot; Naruto and this &quot;past&quot; Minato barely ever collided timelines in conversation. I understand that during time travel, contact between past, present and future beings should avoid communication as much as possible in case of destroying space and time but I think they followed this concept too well to the point where you shouldn&#039;t even bother getting your hopes up over this idea.<br />
<br />
 I also feel like the story was a bit rushed in that they found the enemy too quickly and that the second half of the movie just consisted of everyone trying to defeat the bad guy.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10 <br />
The art was good. I like all the art in Naruto movies. Hell, I like anime movie art in general. But there is no jump of quality since the last movie. So whatever you saw there, its no different from this one.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Sound was fine. Nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Characters were pretty good. Naruto being his charging forward self. I felt that there was a lack of focus on Minato though. I felt like the way they showed him made him look weak as the only move he uses in the entire movie is Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu and his Flying Thunder God Technique via Flying Thunder God Kunai. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
I enjoyed it as a time killer but compared it falls short of being on par with the other movies. Like every Naruto movie, Naruto pulls out a super-special-movie-only Rasengan. Yes, he does in this movie too. You will laugh at the name.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
The movie was good, not great, but good. I should also warn you, whatever you see in the trailer, forget it. Not once is the word &quot;son&quot; or &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;father&quot; used in the movie. The trailers lie. Also... either the enemy is very very powerful, or Naruto got weaker. He never even goes beyond 25-30 clones.<br />
<br />
Btw... this is my first review.<br />

    This is the seventh Naruto movie, made around the time the protagonist finds out who his parents are. The movie abuses the time travel gimmick to offer some silly fanfic situation where he can meet them while they are still alive. Other than that, the whole thing is made without much care or love. It’s like they animated it just for the fans who wanted to see all the adults of the series still as kids and Minato kicking ass with his super elite powers. And the problem is, they didn’t even offer that. Minato barely does something in this movie any ninja couldn’t do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320945">
        better.<br />
<br />
So the generic villain of this movie tries to take advantage of a power source sealed by the fourth Hokage, which ends up throwing him and Naruto back in time (Yamato too but he doesn’t matter at all). Minato was at that moment trying to seal the power source for the first time. As cheesy as this sounds, they could have made something decent out of it if it had good directing. Yet every ten minutes you get a situation where nothing makes sense.<br />
- Naruto is presented like a completely useless and oblivious idiot who just rushes into trouble without any plan at all. Although he acts like that in the main series as well, after all the things he has learned he should definitely not feel like a complete rookie.<br />
- So he ends up in a room with a wall that blocks the exit. Instead of easily breaking through the wall and chasing the girl he found there, he instead jumps upwards. That makes him look like he can’t even break a simple wall, something that he should have done if he is indeed not thinking at all.<br />
- He gets out in a city, which is completely empty of people when he needs to fight some puppet robots and then gets magically filled with people when the battle is over. Convenient?<br />
- He then saves the exact same girl he met from before by accidentally finding her like a needle in a haystack in that huge city, and at the exact moment someone tries to kill her. How much must one bend his disbelief to swallow that?<br />
- Other Konoha ninjas appear at that moment where in a most forced way explain to him that he is from the future, and anything he does could change the flow of time. Well if that is the case then why are they treating his wounds? And skip that; how the devil do they know he is from the future in the first place?<br />
- Then they find out there are no actual people in town. Something that took them years to realize, even when you can clearly see they are all puppets. What the devil does that mean, that for so many years not a single peasant or ninja went in the city for any reason? How about all the robot security or the children yelling for their parents? Don’t all that feel suspicious at all to all the numerous ninja villages?<br />
- Then we learn how the villain used the city’s population in order to create a puppet army and fooled the princess to think there were crowds who loved her. Because it would be too simple to just capture her and just use her power to keep the power flow going in any other way. Does he even know how much energy was wasted for so many years, just to maintain some dolls moving around?<br />
- So the princess saves all the civilians of her city. All 20 of them. That’s right, a city of 10.000 huge buildings was inhabited by 20 people and a few kids. Which is also not suspicious for some reason.<br />
- Afterwards we get the cliché final battle where Naruto just uses his Rasengan to save the day like he always does. And only then does Yamato appear to save them from falling to their doom. He was apparently sleeping all this time. So let me get this right, Yamato went back in time just for a few seconds of pitiful aid in the end? And Kakashi was important to this mission for placing a few explosives here and there? Did he even care that there were civilians trying to get to safety at that very moment?<br />
- And then they decide to wipe out their memories of the event so they won’t affect history with whatever they learned or did all this time. Nice way to render the whole movie useless. Plus, they don’t even perform the amnesia on everyone, since the other two Konoha ninjas, as well as the whole population of the city are not even inside the spell’s radius. Nice going you idiots. Furthermore, when Naruto and Yamato return to the present, nobody wonders why are they covered in so many wounds aside from the ones they had a few seconds ago, or why some of them are already treated nicely.<br />
- And the movie ends with a girl appearing out of nowhere which accidentally happened to be the daughter of the princess and gives Naruto the knife before leaving. Yeah, it’s not like they just destroyed half of your mother’s city right now. And all Sakura has to say about all that is that Naruto is a pervert. Ok…<br />
<br />
The whole movie is one big pile of horse manure. And it is even worse for not even having amazing production values. Everything looks and feels run down, crude animation, boring fights, ugly doll monsters, lazy dialogues, and so on. Amongst the most pathetic films I have watched in my life.

    I&#039;m never a big fan of Naruto movies or anime, especially when the manga quality was going downhill too.<br />
<br />
However, I have to admit that this is the best installment of the series. At least it brought me some emotion at the end.<br />
<br />
The story is still straightforward as you may expect but not as stupid as other Naruto movies/fillers. At least the final doesn&#039;t appear to be super overpowered but finally get crushed completely by Naruto (he is still crushed by Naruto but after being nerfed by a third party).<br />
<br />
This movie doesn&#039;t rely much on dazzling visual effects like the previous Shippuden movies so some brainless

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36970">
        people may find that disappointing.<br />
<br />
I would normally rate this 7 but just to encourage people to appreciate this more than other movies, I give an 8.

    A popular trend re-emmerges:<br />
- Naruto must look after a bratty, importiant young girl; those who have watched a couple of Naruto movies previously are bound to pick up on this element, which is now cliche<br />
- Another movie only element we come to expect is Sakura gaining the opportunity to spring into action for a breif moment, despite the fact that this is rareity in the anime<br />
<br />
We also have shortcuts:<br />
- Did the storyboard in this film think we wouldn&#039;t notice the Hutzil robots from Darkstalkers making an appearance?<br />
- A villian being in the proximity, hiding behind a small statue was out of place and contradicted te

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36696">
        notion of a &#039;sealed environment&#039;.<br />
<br />
Cliche&#039;s and shortcuts aside, the plot is OK, very straight forward...<br />
Naruto and co. are sent to re-new the 4th Hokage&#039;s seal, yet things don&#039;t go to plan. Naruto gets zapped to the past and coincidentelly, gets to work alongside Minato.<br />
<br />
Pro&#039;s of this film:<br />
- Some people like cliche&#039;s and shortcuts, they can fit well at times<br />
- Minato is present in this movie<br />
- Shino and Choji&#039;s dad&#039;s get some attention<br />
- The scenery is unfamiliar and quite attractive<br />
- The villian isn&#039;t quite as hopeless and over eccentric as others have been<br />
<br />
Con&#039;s of this film:<br />
- The lack of villian<br />
- Fairly lazy writing, the safe route has been used by incorporating outnumbered battles and a &#039;damzel in destress&#039;<br />
- If you&#039;re hoping to see a Minato rich film, you&#039;re wrong! It&#039;s reminisant of the shippuden 6 tails filler; production could focus an an interesting, relivant dead character, yet they choose to big up their own creation, an irrelivant, &#039;importiant&#039; little girl<br />
<br />
Final verdict - fairly mediocre, yet possibly one of the better movies; 5/10.

    I&#039;m going to keep this short and simple. It was boring. Really boring. I fell asleep watching it, so I decided to rewatch it. I fell asleep again. The concept is confusing. I tend to enjoy the Naruto movies, even though I don&#039;t like the anime that much. I am still trying to figure out what the entire movie is supposed to be about. Not to mention, the way Naruto gets into this situation makes absolutely ZERO sense. The introduced characters are terrible, forgettable, and its hard to care for them. The villain, unforgettable and lame, is basically a poor man&#039;s Doffy.

    This anime movie is really good i have to say. At first, i hesitated that i didn&#039;t really want to watch it. But then when i got near the end of the movie, i was so hooked on. During the end of the movie, when everybody forgotten about what had happened when they traveled back in time, Naruto met the daughter of the person whom he saved inside the past. It made me imagine how it would feel to forget about everything that had happened, and to forget a special person whom you love. It moved me so much

    This movie was so good. <br />
If you have watched the previous Naruto and Naruto Shippu. Series then this movies answers alot of questions. It relates the main family story line of naruto and his mother and father. <br />
<br />
Hidden Story<br />
SPOILER<br />
SPOILER<br />
SPOILER<br />

So Naruto meets his father the 4th hokage Yodame and helps him save the Queen. Right before he returns to his own time everyoness memories are erased. The Queen is actually naruto&#039;s mother. And in the ending credits show the queen pregnant with naruto.

    Okay., I happened to watch this very much anticipated movie of Naruto shippuden just recently. Actually, I can no longer bear to miss this movie since there&#039;s already an upcoming NS on the big screen entitled Blood Prison.<br />
<br />
Well ... The Lost Tower did rock my narutard world again!! Damn!! Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden recent movie always surpasses the previous film itself., though all the N/NS movies are always at its best in their own given year. <br />
What truly made this film so remarkable is the fact that Minato is one of the main characters here!! *kyaa!!!! Yondaime was soo damn hot and gorgeous!!!*<br />
And well., as usual., silly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40277">
        Naruto never even realized -spoiler--------- that the ninja guy who looks like an older version of himself and the same guy who seems to always protect him was in fact, his father. But of course, Yondaime knows about Naruto! *Kizuna!!!* <br />
<br />
At first, I lily lily *really, really* thought that the 4th NS movie has something to do with Naruto&#039;s parents, Minato x Kushina :PP *the heck!! that Princess Sara girl *yare, yare, that name did sound a bell to me!* looks like a younger version of Kushina!! *oh my eyes played a trick on me!!*<br />
<br />
the action scenes/graphics are superb!! The Super Rasengan is a real &#039;tour de force&#039;!!<br />

    I&#039;m not really a fan of any of the Naruto Films as in my opinon they&#039;re really just one big filler, and this one proves to be just that...<br />
<br />
Story - Ok, I don&#039;t want to just bring up the stupidity of having time travel in Naruto as it kind of ruins the purpose (even though its a filler jutsu) of the story of Naruto. The puppet master thing is unimaginative and ridiculous, why would a puppet master have need of a time travel jutsu and the whole thing that he can put chakra theads everywhere is stupid, he does not have the same kind of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69125">
        chakra as Naruto so how can he do it. It&#039;s nice to see Minato but he plays a bit of a worthless role in the film as he really just supports Naruto, Yamato could have done the same job and may have done it better as he has the wood style and the bad guy controls wooden puppets, so...<br />
<br />
Art - Same as it always is in Naruto, can&#039;t expect any better even though this is a film.<br />
<br />
Sound - The Soundtrack is a bit lacking and does not have the edge that previous movie soundtracks have had.<br />
<br />
Character - I&#039;m only talking about the filler characters here, Mukade (Anrokuzan) is a really irritating bad guy, it&#039;s not that he&#039;s hard to defeat it&#039;s just that he keeps resurrecting and repairing himself, so he&#039;s just a tedious bad guy. Queen Sara is a annoying character as well, when I saw the trailer I thought she was Kushina but no, of course she isn&#039;t...acts like a stuck up queen at first and believes Anrokuzan is a good guy, finds out he&#039;s bad and gets completely trolled, what a bad judge of character, well Naruto can&#039;t speak, he couldn&#039;t even figure out Minato was his dad...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Next to none.<br />
<br />
Overall - Plot was bad, film was bad, try harder next time Junki Takegami (Writter) and come up with a better film, hell, Will of Fire was a better film and thats a stretch.<br />
<br />
Positives - Your joking right...<br />
<br />
Negitives - Everything...<br />
<br />
Thanks for Reading - AkatsukiBuzai - Kuroagi

    For a filler story, it was just that. Designed to fill space. There is no point to this movie. I can say no more without adding spoilers. The previews were intriguing, and I really wanted to see something at least on par with the second Shippuuden movie. That wasn&#039;t the case. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t your typical Naruto filler story, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. It&#039;s not the average &quot;village in peril&quot; sort of filler arc (yes I have said that F word over and over, and I am not sorry for using the F word). Filler is usually bad, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87419">
        this is no exception. Even the action scenes were a disappointment int his one.<br />
<br />
Why did I give it a &quot;4&quot; then. Well it gets a point for originality (meaning it&#039;s different than the other F movies), then it gets 1 point for me liking the characters in it. It gets 1 point because I made it to the end, and the last point is because it had some moments that were ok. That&#039;s as generous as I can be without completely lying about this movie. Now let&#039;s talk about how it earned my disdain.<br />
<br />
First, where/when/why/how this story takes place is just silly. The main characters in this are Naruto and Minato (the fourth Hokage) who as we all know died the day Naruto was born while he protected the village (or so goes the generic setup for the original story). This could have been executed in an interesting way, but don&#039;t over think it. Now that you have an idea of the situation (which you only needed to look at the image on MAL of this movie to get that much), both of them team up in this movie to save... Well I stopped caring at that part of the story. Again, don&#039;t over think it. This is purely a fan fare action story. What if... Naruto and Minato teamed up in some FILLER story. That&#039;s all this was.<br />
<br />
Naruto has reverted to an older version of himself in the series. It&#039;s like a personality reboot (but then again, most F arcs in the series do the same thing). The chemistry between the two characters isn&#039;t forged in an exciting or interesting way, and I often questioned whether they had any real chemistry. Other than the occasional smile from Minato, I felt like they only connected because they knew they were from the same village. One of them figures out more or less the situation (geeze I wonder who), and really there are not any good surprises or twists in this movie. I had hoped to see something a little more witty and clever, and it just didn&#039;t deliver on that front. It&#039;s just a bad attempt to do something that should have been interesting. Thankfully, this story doesn&#039;t matter in the grand scheme of things since it&#039;s FILLER.<br />
<br />
Not a must see, I would advise passing on this one unless you like complete fan fare nonsense.

    (Spoilers)<br />
<br />
So this movie was ok, the story was was fine but that interesting when it came to hyping me up for the movie<br />
<br />
Story 7/10- The movie seems like it takes place after Jiraiya death but before Pain&#039;s attack on the leaf and the story is basically time travel which sounds fine but I don&#039;t think it was interesting as Naruto and Yamato travel back in time to stop someone  but in the end, they forgot what happens but it was cool how Naruto meets Minato even though Naruto doesn&#039;t who he is to him but like I said they do forget about what happened

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381234">
        though<br />
<br />
Art 7/10 and Sound 7/10- The art was fine nothing really bad about it, and the voice acting and sound were ok also.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10- There only two main characters that are important in this movie and they are fine nothing really that interesting them as one of them is the villain and the other the person Naruto has been helping.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10- The movie was ok, the story itself was fine not that good but I think the moment I liked is how Naruto and Minato were working with others to finish off the enemy which like farther and son moment.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10. A fine story, fine art and sound, ok characters and some good moments. This movie was fine

    Unexpectedly enjoyable for a Naruto film. The time travelling story is decently executed, albeit formulaic. If you&#039;re an avid fan of Doctor Who or a similar show, chances are, you&#039;ll like this one.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be fooled by the poster. The fulcrum of the story is Saara; and heaps of character development and screen time are on her. Naruto and Yondaime are the supporting characters. <br />
<br />
Saara reigns over an beautiful odd kingdom. Her goal is to &quot;rule&quot; like her mother, who impressed upon her to put people first. However, her odd adviser seems to have other ideas.  <br />
<br />
The Lost Tower touches on several concepts which could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review63635">
        have been better explored, but since this is a Naruto film, the audience is mostly left with a mission-type story in which Yondaime&#039;s presence adds a special shine. Saara quickly learns that her beautiful odd kingdom is built upon slavery; and what public &quot;happiness&quot; she sees is artificial. The story also presents ambition and aggression through male characters, and nurture and care from the female characters. I could be reading too much into it, it seemed a dig on the overworked Japanese husband driving corporate and national progress while barely having any time for his Japanese wife and children. <br />
<br />
Minato here is on his way to be Yondaime, and Naruto&#039;s interactions with him are the non-canon gems we all wish Kishimoto could have added to the manga. Like Saara growing up to be like her mother, the film says that Naruto is growing up just fine to be like his father.<br />
<br />

    Plot &amp; Synopsis:<br />
	Naruto Uzumaki, a shinobi from Konohagure or &#039;The Village Hidden in the Leaves&#039;, embarks on a mission with the rest of his team to stop a rogue ninja puppet master Mukade from acquiring an ancient power. Captain Yamato, Sakura and Sai all encounter said puppet master in ruins of a once glorious country (?) Rouran where in an attempt to snatch the power, he an Naruto are thrust 20 years in the past. Now, Naruto has no idea what is going on as he awakes and finds himself in the middle of Rouran&#039;s political affairs with a team of mysterious Konohanagure shinobi whose

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36982">
        leader seems vaguely familiar to the young hero.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
	Being a typical piece of the Naruto franchise, it centers on the title character Naruto and a number of supporting cast that appear a few times throughout the movie. Naruto is as headstrong and heroic as always, babbling on and on about having guts, doing what you have to do and his ninja way. The supporting cast is made up of the antagonist Mukade, a rogue shinobi puppet master, Rouran&#039;s Queen Saara and none other than Namikaze Minato, a Konohagure shinobi. Appearances by series regulars in their adorable 20 years ago selves were also made by Might Guy, Asuma Sarutobi, Kakashi Hatake and I think that was Kurenai there for a scene.<br />
<br />
Sound &amp; Music:<br />
	Utilising the original cast from the series, voices such as Takeuchi Junko, Nakamura Chie and Morikawa Toshiyuki were featured as Naruto, Sakura and Minato respectively with new voices for our 20 year prior cuties and the original characters Mukade and Saara. As for the music director, I dunno but I will commend whoever it is for selecting Nishino Kana&#039;s single &#039;If&#039; as the ending theme. I found out about the movie because I heard the single was being used as the ED so I decided to check it out. Nothing much more to say here, as a typical action based shounen anime film crashes and screams to increase power were prominent. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation:<br />
	Really short section here. Rouran 20 years ago was really nicely done. It reminded me of something European almost like a church with the way the buildings were done. I almost thought I was watching something like DenYuuDen for a second. The colours were nice and such and Saara was designed pretty nicely while Mukade could&#039;ve done with another trip to the drawing board compared to some previous antagonists. I guess it was ok based on the nature of how the story went. All in all, pretty nicely done Murata Masahiko and Yamashita Hiroyuki.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Closing Comments:<br />
	Well I&#039;m not a Naruto fan but the movie was decent. In my opinion, it started out boring then got exciting for the remainder until the generic ending. I would&#039;ve liked a little more screentime and interaction from Minato though. The movie mainly followed Naruto when I thought, given the posters and how it was advertised, it would&#039;ve been a NaruxMina moment. As mentioned at the start, a pretty generic plot with the bad guy in search of some awesome power then Naru beating him down in the end. Why do people make awesome powers? They&#039;re just gonna fall into evil hands at some point or the other... Highlights were the climatic fight that started pretty early on and went on for a while so points for that and Kana as the ED.

    They went totally wrong with this movie.<br />
Naruto travels back in time. He meets his father also the future 4th Hokage. We also have the ninjas of the village when they were kids. <br />
So they dont focus on the kid versions of the ninjas from the village, instead they are shown in only one scene!<br />
We had a great chance of seeing Kid Kakashi and Future 4th Hokage in action, but they always disappear off the screen. And instead they focus solely on Naruto. <br />
Even during the boss fight when 4th Hokage and Young Kakashi are present they are nowhere to be found.<br />
 What were they thinking?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62393">
        When I saw the trailer for this I was really expecting to see the kids of the village in action; Kid Kakashi, Kid Guy, Kid Shizune and all the rest of the future Jonins. What a disappointment. <br />

    This movie was terrible!!!! I really like the naruto series and I love what Kishimoto is doing with the manga however this movie seemed to me like it was thrown together quickly.  Initially I wanted to watch this anime becasue of the trailers but the movie was a huge dissapointment.  I do not suggest watching this movie at all.  The story line did not make sense either in comparison to the manga.  The other movies at least made sense and you could figure out where in the story this might occur.  This was not the case with this movie I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38118">
        could not figure out where in the hell they could possibly fit this movie into the story line.  Actually I do know where it fits in but that does not make sense to me either anyways I suggest save the hour and half of your life and watch something more productive such as a bleach film or something.

    **THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
After 3 steady in quality Naruto: Shippuuden movies the creators finally dropped the ball with this one.<br />
<br />
Story: (4/10)<br />
<br />
The story of Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 4 - The Lost Tower begins with Naruto, Sai, Sakura, and Yamato going on mission to stop a rogue ninja named Mukade from removing a seal in the ruins of Ouran. When he successfully removes the seal a large amount of energy devours Naruto and Yamato. When Naruto wakes up he soon finds out that he had been sent to the past and into the new city of Ouran. I found this story to be very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213358">
        predictable with nothing making it any different from any other Naruto movie. The story moved in the same way as the first Naruto: Shippuuden movie. The chakra blade that they introduced in the beginning of the movie that could cut chakra strings ended up to be very gimmicky and unnecessary because it was only used in the end of the movie. A thing I didn&#039;t get from the movie is how they way Naruto and Yamato were sent back in time through a &quot;space-time jutsu&quot; which didn&#039;t make any sense because of how they didn&#039;t go further into detail in how a jutsu can send you back in time but the jutsus in the anime didn&#039;t make any sense anyway because of how there are no boundaries to them. Another thing that I found in the movie to be very disappointing were the fight scenes. The fight scenes were not even close to as good as the fight scenes from the third Shippuuden movie because of how each character would recycle their jutsus over and over again especially with Naruto. The ending for the movie was terrible.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: (5/10)<br />
<br />
I found the art in the movie to be very average because there was nothing visually appealing to it. The animation in the movie was good even though the action scenes were boring.<br />
<br />
Sound: (4/10)<br />
<br />
The soundtrack wasn&#039;t very interesting with nothing really adding to the scenes and just overall very forgettable. <br />
<br />
Characters: (4/10)<br />
<br />
Many characters were pushed to the side in this movie. Sakura and Sai were only in the beginning and end of the movie, so they couldn&#039;t have been easily not in the movie. Yamato only comes up at the very end of the movie with young Kakashi who also only came up in the end of the movie. Chouza and Shibi only came up in one fight scene. One of the most disappointing things about this movie is how this movie seemed to be hyping up the reason on how Minato was going to be in it but the truth is that he was rarely in the movie. This was the exact same situation as the one in the second Shippuuden movie with the inclusion of Sasuke into the story. Minato&#039;s most important scene was in the ending which was very underwhelming. Saara who is the main character of the movie was just like every other underdeveloped main characters from the other Naruto movies. The villain in this movie is also very underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (3/10)<br />
<br />
It was at least well animated during the fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall: (4/10)<br />
<br />
Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 4 - The Lost Tower that wasn&#039;t very interesting and just felt like a big waste of time. This movie is the worst Naruto: Shippuuden movie so far.<br />
<br />

    The short: A rougue Ninja from the country of the Wind, Mukade, is aiming to get a hold of a power by the name Ryuumyaku which is located within the old city of Rouran. It holds an incrediable source of energy, and therefore it was sealed by the Fourth Hokage back then. Team Kakashi&#039;s mission, is to stop this man and renew the seal. When they encounter the enemy, things doesn&#039;t go as smooth as they planned it out to be.<br />
<br />
Overall: It&#039;s always a BAD idea to make a solely Naruto movie. You have to include the other ninjas, otherwise you would end up with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130013">
        a boring movie.<br />
The Naruto universe has so many ninjas with so much to offer - Yet they decided to let Naruto go almost solo on this one.<br />
<br />
Verdict: This movie was a disappointment. If you&#039;ve thought the first movie was boring - You ain&#039;t seen nothing yet.<br />
<br />
3 = Very bad
