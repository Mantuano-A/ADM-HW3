    When you look at the cover Oda Nobuna no Yabou, you would immediately think &quot;oh, its just another cliche harem series&quot;, I wouldn&#039;t blame you if you did as it does look like one and I myself thought of it as one, but when you actually watch it you realize that there is simply more to it than that, its definitely not a tasteless cliche and although it has many female characters, it doesn&#039;t present itself as a stereotypical harem where they are all attracted to the male lead.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t bother with the introductions because I know you are smart enough to have read the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68777">
        synopsis first, so I won&#039;t repeat anything you already know. Instead I will get straight onto the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
The thing that most other cliche harem/romance animes out there fail at is the story, they continuously throw in unneeded fanservice and ecchi scenes to please the viewers instead of telling the story. However, unlike them ONnY cuts the ecchi short and focuses more on giving the viewers a good story and plot, which is commendable. However although i say this, they put in all the fanservice in the ending credits lolz XD but its much better than putting it in the episode itself where it will ruin the storytelling and the serious aspect of the anime<br />
<br />
So far the storytelling has been superb and the plot has been interesting, its based on real historical events that happen in the Sengoku Era where Oda Nobuna (female version), the leader of the Oda Clan has an ambition of conquering the whole of Japan, but in order to do so she must take on rival clans and handle internal affairs, the one who helps her on her conquest is Sagara Yoshiharu who is a huge fan of the original Nobunaga Oda, he uses his knowledge from the game he played &quot;Nobunaga&#039;s Ambition&quot; to assist her by telling her what she needs to do and how she must do it. It gets more interesting as the story goes on where you learn more about Nobuna, alliances are made and as other characters are introduced.<br />
<br />
The only plot hole that I&#039;ve encountered so far is how Sagara was able to time travel back in time and how all the major samarai&#039;s turned into girls. However its an anime, so there&#039;s no point nitpicking on these small points when its purely fiction and doesn&#039;t really need to be explained.<br />
<br />
Art: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about this, the characters are nicely drawn  and the vibrant colours and costumes suit the characters really well, its based on clothes of the Sengoku period but its been altered and changed slightly to suit the characters wearing them, which is a good point about this anime because it gives off a unique feeling to them. The action scenes and fighting aren&#039;t too shabby either and are nicely animated.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The opening theme is fine and suits the anime, the voice acting is also done pretty well, the characters that have a mature voice aren&#039;t too husky and the characters that have a sweet and childish voice aren&#039;t too high pitched and loli-like. The voice acting in serious situations are done well and doesn&#039;t feel forced and the same can be said for the comical situations where there is a bit of comedy.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
Yes the characters are a bit clichéd but they don&#039;t act as if they are in a cliché harem anime, instead of the girls falling for the male lead like they should, they have no respect for him and call him a monkey (&quot;saru&quot;) which is taken from his name *S*agara Yoshih*aru*.<br />
<br />
The main Heroine Nobuna is a tsundere character but isn&#039;t an annoying kind of tsundere, more of a cute and pleasant tsundere unlike all the usual clichéd bitchy tsunderes. She can also handle herself just fine, she isn&#039;t a weak character who relies heavily on the male lead, although Yoshiharu is from the future and knows exactly what Nobuna should do, she makes it pretty clear to him that she doesn&#039;t want to be told what to do and can make her own decisions. As time goes by you also start to learn more about her character and more about her ambitions.<br />
<br />
However what surprised me the most was the main male lead Sagara Yoshiharu, his character is pretty unique, he is a weakling but he isn&#039;t weak-willed, even though he acts like a bit of an idiot he helps out using his knowledge and takes command in battle. Although he is a pervert, he isn&#039;t overly horny that it ruins his character. He is a sort of pleasant and funny male lead that you can&#039;t help but like. <br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t much of a harem aspect in the anime where the female characters fall for Yoshiharu one by one, the only romance that is hinted is between him and Nobuna, unlike the usual overly tsundere female and normal male relationship that occurs frequently in anime, this is one of those rare cases where they are both tsunderes, the best example that i could give you that is similar to this is okabe&#039;s and kurisu&#039;s (steins gate) love-hate relationship. They both ridicule each other and argue but they actually care for one another but they refuse to admit it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
Its very entertaining to watch, the story isn&#039;t boring and actually teaches you about Japanese history, Yoshiharu is hilarious and its interesting to see him in action, its also quite funny when he and Nobuna argue, the comedy doesn&#039;t ruin the seriousness of the anime and it does well in changing between the comical moments and serious moments. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t finished the anime but the episodes I have watched have been great and its been getting better and better as the episodes go on. So don&#039;t be discouraged to watch this anime just because it looks like another stereotypical anime because this is a good example of how &quot;you shouldn&#039;t judge a book by its cover&quot;.

    As many have already said, at first glance this show appears to be just mostly your standard harem rom-com, however I was quite surprised when it turned out to be more of a reverse-harem, especially since most of the cast consist of females.<br />
<br />
Story: (7 / 10)<br />
While the story itself isn’t really anything amazing, it well managed to keep me interested enough to finish watching the series. Throughout the show we basically deal with the different tasks Oda Nobuna has to do, or rather what tasks she has for the main character, Yoshiharu. It is an “historical” anime, but since I don’t know much at all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review109293">
        about Japanese history, it’s hard for me to judge how accurate this is, really. However, the fact that Yoshiharu needs to take care not to change too much (as he’s from the future and knows what’s “going to happen”) is quite an interesting element to the show, and adds that little extra as he tries to not reveal important bits of information to certain people, or how he takes from his historical knowledge to get out of situations.<br />
There are however a few major plot holes around, like how Yoshiharu traveled back in time in the first place.<br />
<br />
All in all, it won’t leave you breathtaken, but it’s not like you’ll be bored out of your mind by the story, it’s just that I don’t feel like there’s anything that really makes the story stand out. <br />
Another major problem is also the fact that there’s never really any real conclusion or anything, and thus this series is in dire need of a second season.<br />
<br />
Art: (8 / 10)<br />
The art is overall pretty good, to be honest. It has nice visuals, pretty fluid animations throughout most of the series, and nice-looking backgrounds. While I wouldn’t say there’s a “unique” sort of style to it (thinking something like KyoAni) I also quite liked the character designs. <br />
<br />
However, this brings us to the next point; Fanservice. Now, being a show where a majority of the characters are female, all surrounding this teenage boy then there’s obviously bound to be fanservice. Whether it be Oda’s regular outfit, the occasional fantasy or just overall moe loli characters, fanservice is certainly present throughout the series, however it never really felt like it was overdone or anything (the majority of the fanservice probably appear in the ED, actually). Most of the time they managed to make it somewhat funny, actually, and who doesn’t love the occasional loli? (amirite?)<br />
<br />
Sound: (8 / 10)<br />
I quite liked the music in this show. The OP, “Link” by Aimi, is a bit more fast-paced or upbeat, which fits rather well with the series overall. It’s not really a slow show in any aspect, and all of it is certainly not lollygagging, so this song with a more “action-y” feel to it is rather appropriate, in my opinion.  The ED, “Hikari” by Makino Mizuta, is somewhat slower, and feels like it better captures the “innocent” (or rom-com, if you’d like) side of the series. <br />
The background music was good, but again, nothing amazingly outstanding (then again, I’m not one to really pay too much attention to the BGM).<br />
<br />
The voice acting was rather well done, and further added upon the characters, well, characteristics. The voices are fitting for the characters, and some did a pretty great job at bringing out that little extra in their character (the stuttering of the ninja girl, for example).<br />
<br />
Characters: (7 / 10)<br />
Being the “romantic” (there’s not that much romance, to be honest) comedy, and harem (or well, reverse-harem, rather) that it is, there are some things you won’t really get away from in terms of characters. While the characters are well done, they’re never really fleshed out or developed in any way. There are also quite a few “typical” characters present, such as the Tsundere, the cute loli, the badass mysterious dude, etc. Thankfully, as I wouldn’t say this is really a story-driven series, it’s not really hurt by the lack of character development either. However, it is still important to note that this is a thing in the series, and since once again a lot of the characters are female you might see a bit too many “stereotypical” characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (8 / 10)<br />
I quite liked the show. The story is decent, it was pretty funny, and most of the characters are rather likeable, but it wasn’t really anything more than that. A big problem is ofcourse also the fact that there’s no conclusion at all to the story, and we’ve yet to hear anything about a second season.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
If you’re a fan of harems (or reverse-harems in this case) or just want a rom-com with a slightly less “typical” story, then this might be for you, however I’d avoid it if you’re in dire need of having closure.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ Decent, interesting story.<br />
+ Pretty funny overall.<br />
+ Music was good.<br />
+ Great visuals.<br />
+ Likeable characters.<br />
-----------------------<br />
Cons:<br />
- “Stereotypical” characters.<br />
- No closure to story (needs a second season)<br />
- Plot holes<br />
- Doesn’t really excel in any category (in my opinion)

    Unlike the other review, I&#039;m just going to start off with why I graded them ( ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobunaga &#039; Monkey &#039; or  &#039; Saru &#039;. No, I&#039;m sorry. Main Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobuna &#039; Monkey &#039; or  &#039; Saru &#039;. This anime is a historical, romantic and comedy with a large change of physical looks from the normal history (Gender swap). Plot twists are quite unpredictable. Main Female Lead, Oda Nobuna, is a blonde. I repeat. A blonde. I was quite surprised considering Oda Nobunaga had black

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167083">
        hair. The story follows the history that we know with slight changes which was made when Monkey (Sagara Yoshiharu) time-traveled there. The story&#039;s pacing was good. Nothing was rushed. Ending was okay. Although the romance tag was unanswered that much and the girl in the end, it was fine. At least they finished the main part, the Historical tag. Comedy in this anime was as fine as any other anime. Although it didn&#039;t make me roll on the floor, it was fine. The story was appealing and drew me in. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
When Sagara Yoshiharu was named &#039; Monkey &#039;, it was no joke. The illustrators made him look exactly like a Monkey when it was needed. His hair style kind of looked like a Monkey&#039;s. Emotions drawn by the illustrators were conveyed well to us viewers. You could clearly see what the characters were feeling. The personalities were matched the best for Monkey. The rest of the characters I would say that it was great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
The VA&#039;s voice was matched to the character until the point that you could say that the voice itself belonged to the character itself. Sound effects of the action scenes, the monkey&#039;s monkey voice, everything suited it. The opening of the anime was relatively catchy which makes you want to hear it over and over again. Once you get a hold of it, that is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
The chemistry between the characters were great! I loved it. The characters were all well developed. They made an emotional attachment between the viewer and them. The physical looks of the new Oda Nobunaga were great. A few characters lost their show time at the next part of the anime. The number of supporting characters? A variety. Not too flat, the number was perfect. The villain&#039;s background was not clearly shown. Although it was clear that he had an ulterior motive. I loved all of the characters equally. Except for the villain since I was quite stupid and could not exactly comprehend what he was thinking and can barely remember what he said in the last episode. Look on the bright side, no spoilers! Overall, the characters appealed much to me, the viewer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
<br />
Oh, come on. There is nothing to doubt about this. I enjoyed it so much I was standing on my toes. The romance, what would happen next? When I thought that something bad was going to happen, it just decided to change for the viewer. Great, awesome anime. Definitely one which can make you hit that button which leads  you to the next episode. I could barely pause watching it. <br />
It was more like -<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss  already. Quickly, kiss. Faster plox.&quot;  or just talking to the person in the screen. Obviously I know that I would never get a reply. -cries-<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was one that could be remembered by its viewers as one of the best types of anime which included the Historical tag.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
<br />
As I said in the other sections, amazing. The anime just sucked you in like a whirlpool.

    This anime was a big surprise for me, first because i saw this was a harem and i don&#039;t mind harem but i have seen a lot of them and i thought this was going to be like the other ones and i was really wrong in a way, second was because i didn&#039;t thought they were going to focus on the story and just in the girls but they made a great job focusing on both.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
Well, the story was very good, it follows a 17-year-old high schooler Sagara Yoshiharu who one day time-travels to the Sengoku period and that is the why i didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195542">
        gave this a better score because you don&#039;t really get to know how he time-traveled to the Sengoku period not even through any episode, the reason was unknown but other than that it was great, the fact that he knew how to change the history and helped Nobuna to achieved a way to make her follow the good way and changing what he knew to an unknown result in the future was entertaining and you didn&#039;t know what was coming if everything changed and the fact that she wasn&#039;t corrupted (like the real Nobunaga was) was because she found someone that she loved and that one was Yoshiharu, the other thing i didn&#039;t like was that there wasn&#039;t enough romance, i was like &#039;&#039;kiss her&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;kiss him already&#039;&#039; don&#039;t expect deep romance but overall was very good.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
The animation was great even in the battles they look really well done and the art of the landscape and the cities were just great, and the character design was really good, overall great.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Sound was great with the voice acting, i can&#039;t picture them with other voices that could fit them that great, the music background was very good and the OP was really enjoyable i never skipped it, overall was great.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This was outstanding, i just loved every single character and not to mention Saru was really amazing, he is a real MC, he is not a wuss even tho he doesn&#039;t fight but he was really good in sports so he can avoid things and he was smart too and was never afraid of anything just to make Nobuna happy and the greatest part is that he has a Harem of lolis lol, that was hilarious when every episode a new loli was added to his harem when in reality he wanted girls of his same age was funny but they&#039;re really adorable specially Hanbee with that sweet voice, he has like five lolis and two of his age being Nobuna and other one that i won&#039;t spoil you, Sagara became one of my favorite characters, and the other ones are outstanding, they were really well developed, there&#039;re a lot of characters that were really great in this anime, so this was the outstanding part of the anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
You won&#039;t regret watching this anime, this has almost everything, good humor, amazing characters, great art and sound, very good story, adorable and funny lolis, historical events, this needed more romance or a kiss to be even better but you will like a lot Oda Nobuna no Yabou.

    Just  a little note before I start, this is my first review and I was compelled to write this because I truly enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
So, Oda Nobuna no Yabou, first glance, you&#039;d think &quot;Oh usual guy meets girl after girl until a harem is made&quot;, well sorry to burst your bubble, but there&#039;s more to this anime than it looks.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
 Okay, so maybe some people don&#039;t enjoy this, but personally I like the concept. Time travelling guys arrives at an alternate past where all the &quot;Leaders&quot; are girls, could have been better, but it&#039;s not overused. Usual progression for the story, girl meets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86583">
        guy, they fall in &quot;love&quot; and it builds up from there, and I mean both their feelings and his harem.<br />
  <br />
In Short: Not going to win any massive awards for the story, but definitely deserves an 8 for it&#039;s creativity.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
 Compared to other animes, I&#039;d say the artwork in Oda Nobuna is pretty GOOD, not as good as something like Hagure Yuusha no Estetica (Personal Preference, replace with some other title) but it&#039;s definitely nice to look at.<br />
   <br />
In Short: Not the best, but still amazing<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
 The opening of Oda Nobuna is worth listening to, and that&#039;s coming from a person who skips most intros after hearing it once, it really fits the anime. Now, the sound effects etc. as you&#039;d expect from an anime with sword fighting and the like is pretty good. I think you&#039;d be able to immerse yourself in the sounds of the ongoing battle while listening to a few mc&#039;s chatting pretty well.<br />
<br />
In Short: Amazing sound effects, great voice actors and a good intro, deserving of a 10<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
 Some of you may argue, but I felt that the way the characters acted and are portrayed fits the time line of the show. They&#039;re proper &quot;ladies&quot;, they get embarrassed when they&#039;re supposed to, trust each other more after some experience, and doubt each other when it&#039;s proper to do so. I&#039;d rather not go into detail of the characters themselves, so I&#039;ll say this: The wide array of characters provides various choices favor. (Personal favorite is Goemon)<br />
<br />
In Short: The characters act correctly according to the happenings, there are no weird attitude changes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
 Okay so, it may not average to a 10, but I enjoyed it so what the hell, give it a 10. I loved the concept, the characters and the harem development (compared to other harems), I enjoyed watching the battles and how each character played an integral part in their victory.<br />
<br />
In Short: WATCH THE SHOW DAMMIT<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
 Worth the watch, worth the time, I won&#039;t ignore the fact that some people might not like this anime, but if you&#039;re fine with a few not-so-funny jokes, or getting angry at how disgusting a person looks (it was obviously on purpose) then get your ass off that chair and give Oda Nobuna no Yabou a try!

    Madhouse is known for anime production and adaptation of extreme contents. Their notable products such as Death Note, One Punch Man, and Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (to name a few) are psychologically intense. While, on the other side, less intense shows such as Ore Monogatari!!, Nana and Chobits give a different sense of ambient. Oda Nobuna no Yabou belongs to the latter.<br />

You might be surprised how this simple show&#039;s capability of enticing you - wishing for more. The edge of the show is on its historical stories that compel the content onto the audience whilst paired with Madhouse absorptive capacity to transfer their heritage knowledge

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71481">
        of past works into the making of this anime. With their past experiences and capable technologies, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is produced. While it&#039;s debatable, any supposedly decent work with a stamp from Madhouse studio will be escalated into above average. Whether it may or not be for this case, it&#039;s up to how the individual interprets it.

    Among the hordes of harem comedy anime, reviews on here suggest that this is one of the more exceptional titles that&#039;s actually good. Let me just get one thing out of the way:  This is NOT one of them (at least imo.)The historical setting does little to mask the flaws of this anime.<br />
<br />
STORY 6/10<br />
-This isn&#039;t a strong point of the series, as many would claim.<br />
- Linear and boring plot <br />
- Uninteresting developments. Battles are vague and don&#039;t make sense. How on Earth is Nobuna a Samurai Lord?!<br />
<br />
<br />
ART 8/10<br />
- Character designs are very good.<br />
- Scenery and backgrounds are nice to look at.<br />
<br />
SOUND 7/10<br />
- Fairly nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87663">
        OP and ED that set the tone well for the series.<br />
- Voice acting is very good and suits the characters very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 6/10<br />
-I suppose that this series gets praise because all the girls don&#039;t lust after the male lead as one might expect looking at this title. Nor is he some generic, pervy loser.<br />
-The main female lead is a tsundere, but surprisingly this doesn&#039;t result in her being a generic one dimensional character. She is portrayed as (for the most part) a strong female character, much like the other girls in the series.<br />
-The development of the characters was lacking and once a couple of episodes go by, they quickly became uninteresting.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 6/10<br />
Character development and plot was unsatisfactory. <br />
The humor which is one of the primary reasons people may watch this is this is also boring. Despite what I said earlier, I think it would have been better if Yoshiharu (the male lead) was a complete perv<br />
because there really was no other source of enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Fans of the harem genre will enjoy this. Those of you who don&#039;t usually watch this genre of anime and come into this expecting a good series will probably be left disappointed past the first few episodes.<br />
<br />

    Oda Nobuna No Yabou is a rather exciting new anime for me. <br />
<br />
What i like about it so far is they took a old idea and gave it a fresh twist. Standard time shift backwards but the twist is when you meet all the greatest male figures in Japanese history, they are girls. The whole concept seems somewhat cheesy but they actually do this well.<br />
<br />
They keep the strong character types while somehow making them a little cute. Character designs a i found interesting, when i look at Nobunas standard clothing it just seems so unique for anime. The colors of Gold/Black as always compliment each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68117">
        other but they gave her such a unique clothing choice that i think was just very imaginative.It may be based off of a standard historical style but it looks unique how they have altered it just a bit.<br />
<br />
Anyway the art and sound i give a solid 7, art is fairly standard but the sound effects and voice acting is tops. I think they did a fairly great job casting voice actors for this show. Some stronger than others while others being slightly more sweet and childish giving the show a nice balance.<br />
<br />
The thing i loved most about this show is that they actually use the fact the main character knows whats going to happen in history effectively. I mean they don&#039;t leave that big open plot hole in this show. A lot of similar story lines complete neglect facts like they should know or even could know. This show really embraces the whole reality of the situation and uses it effectively as a story mechanic.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy watching this show, its exciting and it actually teaches you a bit about Japanese historical moments and people. I also like how the beginning they skip the cliched 2 part introduction to the gimmick. They just drop you right into the middle of the action without really feeding you 10 minutes of pre time travel setting/dialogue.<br />
<br />
I think anyone who gives this a good 2 episode watch is gonna watch more, its funny and the plot is solid. The characters are very likable and the show is just well done all around. Solid 9, this is a Great anime.

    A historical isekai that&#039;s actually pretty good. Oda Nobuna no Yabou is an anime about the journey of Oda Nobuna to unite all of Japan together with some dude who came from the future assisting &quot;her&quot; a little as she proceed. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always loved historical things and I don&#039;t particularly hate isekais. When these two combined together, it&#039;s pretty much a free get - meaning &quot;why not just watch it?&quot;. Honestly, Oda Nobuna was a really good anime. I used to watch historical Japanese shows centered around the Sengoku period and they&#039;re really good. Let&#039;s just say that Oda Nobuna no Yabou is the Japanese

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338287">
        cartoon version of those where it tells the story in different aspects. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s cool to see how this anime slightly changes the history and bend it to their own story. Make the generals be all-girl, add a future dude, give him a harem ( technically ), let him help, etc.. Oh man Japan is great. They can certainly do whatever and even make fun of their own history. <br />
<br />
10/10. Recommended to people even if they don&#039;t like the mix of romance ( technically harem ), comedy &amp; historical. It&#039;s fun. <br />
<br />
p.s. Also realized that the groping scene video from Youtube that I saw years ago came from this anime. Lmao. A bit surprised but I kind of expected it. <br />

    There is something that needs to be said about this show before this review proceeds. This is that this show can be a beautiful and interesting/different presentation with exciting fan service (No, not just tits and panty shots) of the Sengoku world to another typical harem/hijinks show. The first will probably be the opinion of people who have studied the Warring States period of Japan, played related video games of them such as Nobunaga&#039;s Ambition and Samurai Warriors, and is generally a fan of the numerous Sengoku shows out there. The latter will of course be someone who has no knowledge in this area. While

          <span style="display: none;" id="review70587">
        I try to be objective in a sense, I can&#039;t help but come reviewing this show as the former simply because it was created for these type of people and does it extremely well. I am of course in no way putting myself as superior to anyone; I simply want people to understand the show may one viewer squeal in delight while another passes up any enjoyment because of circumstances. It&#039;s a show like Carnival Phantasm and Type-Moon in this way.<br />
<br />
To begin with, the show presents a number of fan service that can only be appreciated by the Sengoku, Three Kingdom fans. From the events of Nobunaga&#039;s meeting with Saito Dousan and rifle lighting, to the glorious Okehazama, and to the Zhuge Liang reference of Hanbei, the show throws a number of fan service and interesting references that may go unappreciated by a viewer that has no knowledge of these events and history. <br />
<br />
The plot progresses from the beginning of Nobuna (Nobunaga) as the fool of Owari and her gradual rise to power with the help of someone from the future who has distinct knowledge of the era. Because it mainly goes through her campaigns, it should be noted once again that enjoyment and interest stems from knowledge of some of these campaigns and to see how they will turn out. Yes, while the story tries to stay true to the main events of history, there are enough little events and subversions that allow the viewer feel anxious on what will happen next. An obvious flaw is the blatant ignoring of how the main character ended up in the Sengoku era. This however helps to alleviate the usually sidetracking of the main story in typical time travel/other dimension travel stories where excess time is spent on trying to get back home. It is somewhat refreshing to see this ignored for a change and see the focus on what is at hand.<br />
<br />
In terms of art, people who watched Highschool DxD may recognize Miyama-Zero and his distinct drawing style. It probably goes without saying that the art is wonderfully done if you take a few minutes to watch the show or see Zero&#039;s artwork. The production values are high up there, not ufotable status of course but you can definitely see the effort the animators have put in this show.<br />
<br />
As an Aimi (Ben-to OP) fan, I instantly fell in love with the opening song to the show. She is one of the more underrated stars out there and I definitely urge people to try and check some of her songs out. But to not digress, the soundtrack of Oda Nobuna is superb as well. It does a fine job of setting the mood and evoking the feelings from the situation at hand. From the wacky song that plays throughout the comedy scenes, to the touching melodies during the drama, and to the war-like drum fashion when the troops are preparing to go to war, each song plays a suitable role.<br />
<br />
However, the greatest compliment I have to give to Oda Nobuna no Yabou is it&#039;s characters. The typical thought of someone who first sees this show is the thought that the main character is your generic harem man and the characters are but breasts to fill on TV for the ogling otaku. This is not so.<br />
<br />
The main character, Sagara Yoshiharu is a refreshing character. He is someone that actually uses his knowledge of the era to the benefit, actively participates in every episode instead of sitting around behind his harem of women, even to the point that he is the reason for Nobuna&#039;s success, and is overall competent except for a few comedic moments. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is mature and you can see the many qualities they have underneath their exterior. Nobuna herself goes through a series of touching and good character development. She, like many of the characters of this show, are subverted in such creative and unique ways that I must bow in respect to the author. It really really helps if you know the typical media representation of these historical figures and want to see something different and twisted in many different ways. They are not just your typical gender-bent shameless body flaunting character, though there is quite a number of skin-ship. <br />
<br />
If you are a Sengoku fan, have played KOEI games, and love history in general, then I 100% recommend this show. If otherwise, I still ask for someone to try it out; if not to start learning about the Sengoku period, then for some delicious females, the hilarity, and romance.

    If you&#039;ve ever played Civilization Revolution or Sengoku Rance or some conquer the world game in hard/ expert mode you know how hard it is to conquer the world. Of course the main character would need a lead to be able to be the chosen one and the helpful monkey which is from the future helps nobuna conquer japan.<br />
Story-9/10<br />
Not exactly original. You gain allies and keep on conquering and make mistakes. The only twists are the fact that there is a &quot;monkey&quot; trying to win women ( his harem of friends haha), the fact that all the key historic figures and cute little girls and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73071">
        the fact that Sagara, our monkey, knows the future and the past but not with all the new twists.<br />
Art-9/10<br />
It&#039;s absolutely stellar. Except for the people who are meant to be disgusting but other than them I love nearly every character design and the surroundings. It is what 2012 art should be like.<br />
Sound-9/10<br />
The opening song really fits with the type of genre this is ( conquer japan) and I love the ending song.<br />
Character-9/10<br />
There are not many &quot;steriotypical&quot; characters. Everyone is quite fun and a bit different and all have their own reasons for fighting. the characters with notable personalities would be Sagara (monkey) who is fun and trying to get the most beautiful women in Japan and help Oda Nobuna conquer Japan. There is also Nobuna who has to prevent herself from being overcome by crazyness, anger or greed like many other rulers.<br />
Enjoyment-10<br />
I loved every single episode. It was full of fun and did not have a single dull moment. I wouldn&#039;t exactly say this is great for rewatchability but its a fun filled ride as long as you don&#039;t know the rythm.<br />
Overall-9<br />
A great story. Fun, exciting and a great story. It&#039;s basically a codegeass but without a badass main and the make you think aspect. You should watch it or at least give it a try. Some reasons I&#039;ve heard that made the story awful would be &quot;it&#039;s a harem&quot; or &quot;it looks like it has no plot&quot;. Yes, it is a harem. However there is one girl that stands out and the rest are basically just friends so there is progress. And I assure you, the plot is quite nice for it&#039;s genre. It would be a 10/10 if only it were a bit longer but the 12 episodes I watched were spectacular.

    When I read the synopsis without thinking much, the first thing that came to my mind was that all the characters in the anime, except for the protagonist, were females. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
A story based on Japanese History, which actually entertained me and educated me a bit, mainly because I have Japanese classes. It wasn&#039;t boring, it didn&#039;t drag out that much and if it did, it would be fan-service/some comedy skit added into that. If I were to give a score on originality about the type of story being used in the anime, I&#039;d give it a 9 but if I based it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182608">
        on how much it entertained me, I&#039;d give it a solid 4 but the only thing that saved it was they made it different by putting the protagonist to be someone from the future, having the &#039;ability&#039; (not sure if I could call it an ability) to see the future. The type of male protagonist that come from the future/different worlds and want to save the current world always make the anime better, personally. It had a lot of action, mainly sword fighting and a little bit of magic I suppose. There&#039;s harem and romance, but the harem slowly develops throughout the anime, which doesn&#039;t bother me but as a guy who has watched a lot of harem/romance anime, it was very predictable on who&#039;s going to fall in love with the protagonist. It was somewhat funny, mainly using perverted jokes which are alright, but if overused and repetitive, can get really annoying.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me, but the art style gave a history-ish vibe. Other than that, the colors and nice and bright, animations are smooth and is very easy to catch the eye.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The OST fit scenes nicely and used necessary, not overused and isn&#039;t too loud. The OP fit the theme of the anime, giving that &#039;army&#039; vibe (I&#039;m probably stoned) and the ED fits the romance side of the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
Sagara Yoshiharu, the protagonist who comes from the future (circa 400 years). He&#039;s very obsessed with history games, mainly with the Shogunate eras and all those. He&#039;s very talented, in his own ways because he remembers a whole period of time from the past and uses it to his knowledge to try to save characters from dying. A very kind but perverted person.<br />
<br />
Oda Nobuna, a very cheerful girl who dresses very minimal. She&#039;s a tsundere (not a flat one!!) and cares a lot for the people she loves. She&#039;s not that smart, mainly because she is easy to trap. Without Sagara her nation would&#039;ve died. Kind-hearted and caring (mostly to Sagara ;))<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
It was a new experience for me, as not only did it entertain me, but it actually educated me. Yes there&#039;s fan-service and a lot of &#039;loli&#039; characters, but hey the action was quite nice.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s a second season out there, I&#039;d watch it. I really liked the idea of this anime. If you like protagonist who comes from a different world/future and wants to save the current world he is in, then Zero no Tsukaima is for you. If you like history but not very educational, then Hyakka Ryouran might suit you. Would I re-watch this? Definitely.<br />

    Basically, this story is about our main character going back in time to feudal japan. Immediately he gets caught in the middle of a battle. From what I&#039;ve concluded after watching the first episode, him being there causes the death of a key person of in japanese history, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a key retainer of Oda Nobunaga. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s up to Sagara (main character) to take his place and assist Nobunaga or rather Nobuna and take Hideyoshi&#039;s place. <br />
<br />
I love history and this show seems like a good way to learn about the unification of Japan. It gives off sort of a Axis Powers Hetalia feel to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review65881">
        it where the show teaches a bit of history to the viewer.  <br />
<br />
I find it amusing how the producers turn famous deadly warriors into girls. When i saw Goemon&#039;s character in this show, i couldn&#039;t take this show seriously anymore. Then again i can&#039;t say that i don&#039;t like the idea of them turning them all into girls. I mean seriously? Who doesn&#039;t like watching anime girls with swords and spears, etc beating the crap out of faceless unimportant characters. <br />
<br />
I laughed a couple of times during this show. For instance, the girls don&#039;t even address him by his name. Instead, they call him Saru (Monkey). For the oddest of reasons i felt that this show had the same sort of comedy feel as Highschool Dxd for all of you who have seen it. Not the ecchi comedy part.<br />
<br />
As for it being a harem show, its not one of those dirty ecchi shows. i&#039;d have to say it&#039;s probably a 2 or 3 on a scale of 10 on ecchiness. There are a lot of loli&#039;s though...i already counted like 4. The main character&#039;s a typical harem character. He&#039;s sort of a loser but in his own strange way he&#039;s very powerful. Like in almost any anime, you will find anime stereotypes in this show. <br />
<br />
Personally i hope this show goes where i think it&#039;s going. All the girls in the show seem to disrespect him and think he&#039;s disgusting but i can see him turning that all around. Sort of like in Love Hina. Last, hopefully this show becomes like one of those shonen mangas and takes the main character and turns him into a really cool, bad ass character. Until then, i will be following this show until the end.

    After viewing first episode I had an unusual sensation of deja vu still I didn&#039;t drop it and went on watching only to be pleasantly surprised by the comedy content and romance scenes developing. Also you cannot help but acknowledge the way the oda military makes every battle as strategic as possible. It is a typical history set series that is changed completely by one element: a time traveler. All this makes you ask yourself... What happens if?<br />
The anime has done great about Artwork, characters are drawn very well, unlike some other drawings that make you go sick.<br />
Also the OST are very well made from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review82842">
        the opening song all the way through the episodes until the end with some minor letdowns.<br />
You should watch Oda Nobuna no yabou if you enjoy a good soap opera

    I like the anime when it has good plot, OSTs and Art.<br />
Oda Nobuna is just Amazing in all of them .. the OSTs are Amazing and Epic and fits the Anime very well .. The Art is so awesome.. the plot is the best since there&#039;s no unnecessary  talking.. Less talking More Action !! that how the anime should be.. I won&#039;t say any word other than this // IF YOU LIKE EPICNESS ODA NOBUNA IS THE BEST !! // <br />
<br />
the only thing i disliked and i HATE about this anime is.. IT&#039;S JUST 12 EPISODES !! THIS MUST LAST FOR EVER !! TToTT

    The anime is about Sagara Yoshiharu, who travels back into the Sengoku era where feudal lords fight among each other to expand their territory and to inch their way into conquering Japan. The anime opens with our main, Sagara, trapped in a battle field. He meets the leader of the Oda clan, Oda Nobunaga. No, wait. He is shocked to discover that the man who unified Japan is actually a young tsundere blonde. She’s not Oda Nobunaga; she is Oda Nobuna. Sagara then decides to serve under Oda Nobuna and using his knowledge of playing video games about his conquest, he has proved to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186290">
        a valuable weapon for Oda. He helps her correct wrongs that happened in history and to predict the events to give Oda the advantage. He also vowed to make sure she’s alive after she conquered Japan. It’s not an easy task when the rest of the feudal lords are out to make sure she doesn’t succeed.<br />
<br />
This anime has been the biggest surprise of the season so far because I didn’t even knew this anime existed until a couple of days ago. I certainly didn’t expect it to be so damn good. I saw the title and I sighed a bit because I expect another anime like Brave Ten that uses the feudal era as a setting and basically doing something subpar with it. The anime has all the elements to fail miserably yet it turns out to be very amazing. I always believe that cliché isn’t a bad thing and it all depends on how you use it. This anime has a harem with all the generic fixings but it was able to properly use the elements to make one remarkable story. Also, it’s a light novel anime. I love anime adapted from light novels because they have more emphasis on story than any other medium. Oda Nobuna no Yabou is one of the best anime of the season.<br />
<br />
The anime proves to be a bit ridiculous when you see the first episode. I actually find it hard to believe that they made a show where Oda Nobunaga is a tsundere. It boggles the mind and I was sure this premise wouldn’t last. They might replace it with pointless fan service or build a harem or something. All the elements are there for the anime to drop the premise. We have a bunch of girls and one guy, the generic casts of a harem is here: the tsundere, the big breasted one, the silent one and the loud one. They just needed to align themselves and I was preparing for the worst. It didn’t happen though. The anime didn’t disintegrate into a senseless Ecchi or Harem anime. I was relieved to know that. It couldn’t become a pointless Ecchi show mainly because the anime has a pretty impressive story to tell.<br />
<br />
The biggest hurdle in this anime is accepting the fact that the heroes of Japan are replaced with girls. Oda Nobuna is a freakin tsundere. If you can follow that fact then you can enjoy the anime. It started pretty interesting actually. The first episode started with a battle and the plot was laid out pretty nicely afterwards. The idea of having a guy from the future telling Oda of all the things she did wrong is pretty sweet. It’s like going to the movies with a guy who already seen it. He spoils the story and Oda is able to capitalize from it. The rewriting of history and the characters turning into cute girls is among the charm of the anime. The plot of the anime is very serious despite the ridiculous elements of the anime and it’s the reason why the anime was able to straighten out right away. The first half has some very powerful episodes that will easily grab you.<br />
<br />
The anime is about a part of history of Japan though but it never got in the way. I recognize most of the characters because I played a lot of Orochi games on the PS2 and that’s as far as I know regarding the Sengoku era. The anime often has time to have a narrator introduce the characters so they can easily slide themselves into the story. After the introduction, the anime proceeds in building the story. There are a lot of dialogues in the anime but it was used to establish certain situations in the anime. The anime is like watching a game of chess and you eagerly wait for the moment where a player shows the trick up his sleeve. There are a lot of moments in the anime that is really impressive. One example is declaring that building a fort in the field would prove impossible because it’s near a feudal lord’s territory and he will do his best to make sure the fort won’t be built. The anime uses certain situations like this and have Sagara or Oda have their moment of brilliance and attempt the impossible. Once you get used to the pattern, it’s not long before you wait for the next big hurdle to come and the moment of brilliance the characters will do to overcome the problem.<br />
The characters are certainly the strongest point of the anime. They are a bit generic but they have the perfect personality to make the story interesting. The cute little girls being involved in feudal wars are really interesting because the anime did a great job presenting it. Of course, the idea of a stuttering ninja who looks about 9 years old is a bit of hard pill to swallow but when the story moves along its climactic moment, all the characters  was able to bring their own charm to the scene. There are a lot of characters and none of them look alike. They all have a certain role to the story with their unique personality. There is no shortage of interesting characters here from both the good guys and the bad guys. They certainly make the story a lot more interesting.<br />
<br />
Oda Nobuna is pretty rounded herself. She is considered as a military genius capable of doing the impossible but most of the time she is just a little brat. I really love how most of the times, she is the problem and her weak hearted nature adds some needed tension in the anime. It does wear off pretty quickly because the anime relies far too much on her weak personality but it deepens the story and makes it more exciting. One moment she is this girl with a nasty personality trying to rule the country then the next moment she is a docile little kitten that needs the other characters to comfort her out.<br />
<br />
As for Sagara, well, he’s a pretty normal guy. He is the generic type of main character that just flows along with the story. If the scene calls for him to be an idiot then he becomes an idiot. If the scene needs him to be hero then he’ll rise to the occasion. If the story needs him to be “cool guy” the girls will fall in love with then he becomes that guy. I guess it’s a good thing that he’s a flexible main character but he doesn’t have enough personality to stand on his own. It’s not a bad thing though because other supporting characters get some screen time thanks to his lack of a decent personality.<br />
<br />
There are some hints of fan service in the anime but it was never a main focus. The story did point out that Sagara is a pervert but there aren’t any panty shots and there was only one moment of boob grabbing. It’s pretty alright because some of the characters are a bit under aged and it’d be pretty awful to sit through another Ro Kyu Bu type of anime (which gets another season and some more pedo fan service). There is also a slight hint of romance to tie the entire anime together. Sagara and Oda’s relationship is one of driving plot points of the anime and it’s often of the elements that cause a lot of tension in the anime. One moment they’re buddy buddy then when push comes to shove, they’re fighting.<br />
<br />
The anime does have some downsides to it. The biggest hurdle is accepting the cute characters as competent warriors battling adult sized soldiers and what not. The story easily covers that up. The anime never explained Sagara going back to the past though and it does bug me at first. He just suddenly showed up and no mention of black holes or time machines to explain his time travel. The anime obviously didn’t want you to question it because the plot was pretty good that it didn’t matter how he got there. The one complaint I have about the anime though is that the anime slowly pushed Sagara into the background. In the first half, he was very pivotal in the fights because of his knowledge about playing video games. As the anime progresses, this knowledge was no longer used and some of the moments of the second half would’ve been more awesome if the anime had Sagara spoil the fights. It’s a minor complain though and the anime didn’t crumble from the lack of Sagara’s knowledge.<br />
<br />
The pacing in the second half did become a bit fast and certain events had little effect to me because the anime rushed in getting there. There was no climactic build up in the second half and it was a shame that they couldn’t make the final moments of the anime more awesome. It ended pretty anticlimactically and it’s a shame. It did tease a second season and I seriously want another run at this awesome anime.<br />
<br />
In terms of character, the anime did a heck of a good job at it. There is a huge range of character design here from the cute kin of character up to the grown up old type adult character. One thing I love about this anime is that no character looks alike. They are all extremely detailed using the attire of the era to their advantage and putting a spin on it. There is a stuttering ninja with a pink skull hairclip, a little girl with a spear and a tiger hood and even a girl with a cute dragon emblem on her head. The characters are the best part of the anime and it’s their diverse look that makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The animation is also one of the anime’s best parts. The fight scenes are a bit too short but they still have an air of awesomeness to them that makes them fun to watch. The use of CG in some scenes is nicely done because it doesn’t look stiff. The way the camera changes angles is also one of the reasons why the fight scenes are some awesome.<br />
<br />
The fight scenes are pretty straight forward and there isn’t a lot of technicality in them. The anime uses it as a way to move the story along and it’s often not the climax of the anime. It often leads to the climax but the battles where never once the main attention of the anime. The moment of brilliance among the characters is like building a fort overnight. That being said though, the fight scenes are still pretty nice. The capture the feel of a real war and there are enough effects to give us the impression of a massive battle. There is no blood though. I would’ve preferred at least some blood out of slashed necks but the anime often cut away before any blood would gush out or they would be off screen. Let’s focus on the moe characters instead.<br />
<br />
The anime’s OP is “Link” by Aimi. This really captures the anime’s theme and it nicely reflects the relationship of the two main characters. The anime’s opening sequence is pretty awesome as well. It introduced all the characters without spoiling the story and overwhelming the viewers. I also love the scene of the horses meeting each other for a battle. You can clearly see the awesomeness of the anime and the high production value of the anime.<br />
<br />
The ED song is “Hikari” by Makino Mizuta. It’s a slow song with a romantic theme to it. It has a meloow vibe to it compared to the rough nature of the anime. The ED sequence is has a bigger fan service than the overall series with all the girls naked and draped with a sheet. It’s pretty nice, I guess.<br />
<br />
This is a really good anime and it’s too good to miss. The plot, the characters and the action all makes for one awesome anime experience. Try to enjoy the moe girls fighting in the Sengoku era because the anime is really great. I highly recommend it.

    &quot;So much loli girls in this anime!&quot; thats my first impression when watching this, ok, lets forget it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What will you do if heroes that you know is different from what are you thinking and studying?&quot; Like Oda Nobunaga is a blonde girl?<br />
WHAT? ok, since its anime i think thats fine.<br />
<br />
First of all, some event that occur in this anime is based the REAL history of oda nobuna (except the gender of course), well, Oda Nobuna replicates many Oda Nobunaga event, or we can said its same as the three kingdoms was replicate by Dynasty warrior. You will enjoy the anime and studying about japanese history,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84433">
        interesting isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
STORY 9/10<br />
The story involves about Sagaru,  a highschool guy which is unknownly stranded into the era of Oda Nobunaga where ALL the major samurai was a cute girls. and he promises to Oda Nobuna (Not Nobunaga) that he will helps her to achieve her dream to unite japan. as far as go, the story really interest me, since its rare to see some harem anime (well, i always thought this anime is a harem), which have a strong plot and nice development between the two main lead. and love that happen (harem typical) wasn&#039;t exaggerating , they (the girls) didnt express their feelings in any weird way, and later, the twist in nearly the end of the series was really suprising me. &quot;i never really thought that&quot; thats what i said.<br />
<br />
ART 8/10<br />
I cant said too much on this section, for me as the story was good, i dont really mind about the art. well, for this anime , i thought the art was really nice, especially when the battle and war scenes, it looks realistic.  i really enjoyed it. and for the character, i think they are really well-made, and again not exaggrating in &quot;Boobs&quot; section like any other harem anime. thats a good point!<br />
<br />
SOUND 8/10<br />
Again, i cant said too much on this, but surely the opening song was nice (really nice, even i searching for this song) and really fits with the story and the anime itself, it represent on what will hapen. and the voice actor really did a good job, especially loli girls voice. the voice was so childish and it really fits with the loli character. Not just the loli voice, but the other character voice wasn&#039;t really bad too.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 7/10<br />
i think this was the weakness for this anime, so many questions in my head about this, like how can that highschool boy can do time travels? is he a john titor? and since the story was focussing on the conquest of Oda Nobuna, i think thats acceptable if the each character didnt get any own story. and more, its just 12 episode. its too hard to expand and explaining for each character. and i think there will be a season 2 for this, and hope they will fill &quot;the holes&quot; in the season 1.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL 8/10<br />
I am really glad i found this anime, i am not just enjoying this anime but in the same time, its feeling like studying japanese history. i am not japanese, but with this anime, i think i am interest in Oda Nobunaga era like i interest in three kingdoms. A totally great anime to watch! <br />

    Oda Nobuna no Yabou appears like a fairly simplistic reverse gender harem/romance and comedy set in the Sengoku Era  at first glance, but there&#039;s actually more to the plot than meets the eye... <br />
<br />
The story revolves around a 17 years old young man named Sagara Yoshiharu, who is sent to an alternate version of the Sengoku Era without currently providing any explanation of how he achieved such a feat.<br />
<br />
However, not is all as it seems...<br />
<br />
Sagara quickly realizes that the fearsome Oda Nobunaga has been replaced by a girl named Oda Nobuna in this continuity and that other historical figures such as Shibata Katsuie and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review66655">
        Niwa Nagahide have also undergone an inexplicable shift in gender.<br />
<br />
On top of these historical inconsistencies, he is mistreated and/or not taken seriously within the Oda clan and has to earn the trust and respect of his own companions and the fiery Nobuna and maybe find love...<br />
<br />
Note: All following statements explaining my scores are but mere opinion. Also, I have only watched two episodes as of now so my opinion on the series may change along the way.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
I think the main appeal of the story is the potential it holds when it comes to changing historical facts as current episodes show Sagara actively trying to alter the course of history as he knows it so that Nobuna doesn&#039;t become like Nobunaga and leaves one to wonder what will happen to the roles of Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Tokugawa Iyeasu if she remains alive unlike her historical counterpart or just how far will Sagara&#039;s knowledge of the future will get him before he gets a prediction wrong.<br />
<br />
Another good aspect of the story is how the comedy aspect of the show does not overlap on the serious aspect of the story like say...Nyarko-san where there was virtually no boundary between the two.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
As expected from Madhouse Studios, the art is just fine, the ecchiness is mild and not too overbearing. There isn&#039;t anything wrong with the animation in general at first glance though I did not make a thorough investigation (as in frame by frame) like I usually do.<br />
<br />
The only complaint I would have is against the ending sequence, did they really have to put so much ecchi shots cause it&#039;s literally made of them! <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The sound and voices are fine as well, the background music and sound effects reflects the mood of the scenes and aren&#039;t squeaky or unbearable and the voices are pretty good as well.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
<br />
Every character is well fleshed out and don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re talking to a random background character. Here&#039;s a short list:<br />
<br />
Sagara: A harem hero who has &#039;balls&#039;, that&#039;s all you need to know.<br />
<br />
Nobuna: The Tsundere who is quite reckless and her inability to say what she wants honestly is a flaw can make her as dangerous as Nobunaga himself if no one is there to voice their opposition. <br />
<br />
Katsuie: The big chested girl who is serious most of the time and gets embarrassed quite easily, follows the &#039;knight&#039; archetype.<br />
<br />
Niwa: The &#039;ojou&#039; type-2 (TvTropes) girl who acts cool and mature and likes to rate people and their actions.<br />
<br />
Goemon: The loli girl who has difficulty speaking coherently as her speech drags on and is actually pretty skilled as a ninja, which may hint to having been trained so hard she didn&#039;t get a proper education.<br />
<br />
(There are obviously more, I&#039;m just naming the &#039;main&#039; ones)<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
Over all, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a really unique &#039;harem&#039;/comedy anime that has a hidden flavor for any Japanese history maniacs if on is willing to look past all the &#039;anime&#039; aspect of the show and can be very enjoyable.

    When I saw Oda Nobuna no Yabou I really wasn&#039;t expecting much. It looked like a typical harem anime set in a historical  time frame. Which it is. Most of the characters are typical harem type characters and the anime is laced with comedy and romance.<br />
<br />
So there you have it.<br />
<br />
Not quite. Its the historical time frame that separates it from your usual harem comedy. The story is very loosely based on the life of Oda Nobunga, the hero of Japan&#039;s Sengoku period, through the eyes of Sagara Yoshiharu a 17 year old boy from the future who replaces Toyatomi Hideyoshi, and includes most of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73149">
        the key characters of the period except in this version Oda Nobunga is actually called Oda Nobuna who is a teenage girl as are the rest of the main characters in the anime.<br />
<br />
As a result we have an anime which is a lot of fun likable characters and lots battle and action scenes which are based on real events in Oda Nobunga&#039;s life with some very good artwork.<br />
<br />
I would recommend swatting up on Japan&#039;s Sengoku period and Oda Nobunga&#039;s life a little to get the most out the anime as it will help to understand the plot.
