&quot;Dust in her eye? I&#039;m gonna kill it!&quot; - Hakuya Mitsumine.<br />
<br />
Over the last few years, Rom-coms have become stale; the violent tsundere, a harem, the childhood friend, unrequited love, all of the shows seem to have these itsy-bitsy things. As such, the comedy becomes stale, they become increasingly dull to watch and you automatically know what is going to come next.<br />
<br />
But not with Mikakunin de Shinkoukei.<br />
I repeat, you will not be able to predict what will be coming next in this little anime.<br />
<br />
Mikakunin de shinkoukei is REALLY unpredictable. It drops the bomb on huge things like it&#039;s no big deal and makes a big deal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139611">
        out of things that are of no importance. Not only that, the way it handles cliches is completely ridiculous. Almost all of the normal cliches are present in Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, just in a different way. It leads you into preparing yourself for the cliches, but the opposite happens instead ( I will refrain from giving an example not to ruin your enjoyment in this series. You will know EXACTLY what I mean when you watch it) <br />
<br />
Speaking of enjoyment, the kind Mikakunin de Shinkoukei provides you with is the happy and refreshing kind. Mikakunin de Shinkoukei makes you have fun WITH the characters. It will take the weight of your shoulders and make you happy from watching the everyday life of Benio, Mashiro,Kobeni and Hakuya. You will laugh at their eccenticities of each of the cast members, and I assure you, you will get a lot of laughs out of them.<br />
<br />
What about romance? Well, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei has plenty of offer on that matter too. Usually in a romance series, The main couple must overcome misunderstandings, difficulties, rivals, and all those annoying stuff. Mikakunin does none of that.(It will make you think otherwise though) Granted, it doesn&#039;t make you go &quot;D&#039;awww&quot; out loud most of the time, but you surely feel fluffy inside from seeing the two innocent teenagers, Hakuya and Kobeni grow closer and closer.<br />
<br />
In a Rom-com series, proper and strong characters are a must. How does Mikakunin fare in this area? VERY WELL. Benio and Mashiro are the ones that carry the humor in this series, and they do it very well. Say anything you want if Beino&#039;s ridculous sis-con antics don&#039;t make you laugh even once. Slap me through the internet if you don&#039;t laugh at Mashiro&#039;s eccentric actions.<br />
<br />
Do the two main characters get overshadowed by those two then? Of course not. Hakuya seems like your average male lead. Dense, stupid, timid. Oh, how wrong you must be. Granted he&#039;s dense, but he&#039;s a billion times sharper than some *cough* Orimura Ichika *cough* idiots, and that&#039;s because he comes from the mountains. And believe me, looks can be deceiving, he&#039;s not the gloomy guy he seems to be. How happily he reacts to Kobeni&#039;s actions will make you see him in a new light (He sometimes shines when he&#039;s happy)<br />
<br />
Of course, let&#039;s not forget, the main girl, Kobeni Yonomori. The sister of Benio, the sister in law of Mashiro and the bethrothed of Hakuya. It&#039;s obvious that this whole show revolves around her. Her role as a straight man to the antics of the rest of the cast works like a charm. And it&#039;s really nice to see how she slowly turns &quot;dere dere&quot; towards Hakuya.<br />
<br />
The sound department of this anime deserves a mention too. Mashiro&#039;s voice acting is really good (even though this is her VA&#039;s first role). The same can be said for Benio&#039;s voice acting too, she wouldn&#039;t be as funny if the voice actor wasn&#039;t this good.<br />
<br />
The OP and the ED of this anime is addicting. The OP, Tomadoi Recipie, is an upbeat song that will make you want to listen to the first parts again and again (a youtuber made a 10-hour loop of it) And the ED, Mashiro World is one of the cutest EDs of this season.<br />
<br />
In short, Mikakunin is a must if you want a decent SOL-Rom-Com. Or rather, don&#039;t take my word, take your judgement. Go watch it. See if you like it.

    Engaged to the Unidentified generated very little hype coming into its season, being an adaptation of a relatively unheard of manga. So how exactly did it catch my attention when one glance of the line-up for the season had other shows I could of better invest my time with? Was it the cover image of three adorable looking girls in seifuku which called to me? Possibly... Actually, that was most definitely the case. C&#039;mon, let&#039;s be honest; what other reason could there be and please don&#039;t tell me the synopsis had you brimming with optimism. I&#039;m willing to give anything a chance as long as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137227">
        there&#039;s cute girls I can ogle at and I particularly wasn&#039;t looking for something to test my wits or to get me on the edge of my seat. Thus Engaged to the Unidentified was quite the inviting choice for somebody who just wanted to loosen up and let the calm sweep them away. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Is this still your generic SoL rom-com you see rolling in every season? For the majority it is. Nothing screams mundane more than the synopsis of this show so as you can imagine, expectations were pretty low at the point of starting. The first few episodes are mostly spent building characters and observing Kobeni after saying farewell to living peacefully as a normal highschool girl when the Mitsumines join the household. For 1/2 of the show, it&#039;s standard fare in terms of a SoL rom-com; a large chunk of comedy of the moe kind but a pea sized amount of romance. The latter half is where the show begins to peak when we learn the Mitsumines are far from ordinary folk and the connection with Kobeni linked to a long forgotten accident, leading to the reason behind this engagement. Personally, I thought the new turn of events were weird for this show (not shocking) but even so, it still never strayed far from being a normal SoL rom-com. From what I gathered, it was only a means to advance a stagnating relationship so don&#039;t go hoping to have your mind-blown expecting a massive change when you learn of this new revelation. To conclude; a simple premise of girl forced to betroth boy with an innocent yet unusual twist half way that sets the romance into motion.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the art is very attractive. The animations for each character are smooth and slick and fits very well with the show&#039;s direction. It isn&#039;t short of cute or funny moments that would send you on a GIF making binge. Extremely pleasant to the eye and has a certain charm about it that causes you to break into a wide smile. Nothing to really complain but nothing to really highlight as being revolutionary or rousing though. With the atmosphere of what the show was going for, keeping it light and cute was the right direction.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
A mostly unknown cast of seiyuu but fulfilled each of their roles nicely. Personally, i&#039;m not too picky when it comes to this so I wasn&#039;t dejected when peeking at the list. However, I was very surprised to see this was a first time role for Mashiro&#039;s seiyuu who did a standout performance you wouldn&#039;t anticipate. The OP and ED are very upbeat and catchy; I don&#039;t think I ever skipped past them before or after an episode yet felt it was a little dishonest because whilst watching this show, I noticed there was a startling lack of BG music which is very rare for this genre. I&#039;m not usually somebody who pays close attention to it but having noticed myself, it may disappoint other people who do care. I do think this may of been a choice of direction rather than negligence as it emphasised the down to earth nature of this anime.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
A generic story can be carried by a strong cast of characters. In this case, i&#039;m not sure which department wins. There was nothing wrong with them; more like there was nothing special about them that would convince me to add them onto my favourite characters list. Kobeni, the main female of the story, is indeed pretty, considerate and candidate for perfect waifu but wasn&#039;t strong enough to really shine above the others and felt somewhat muted. Hakuya, the main male (and the only one) of the story, I even forget existed in the first half of the show. However, both are as meek as eachother so there is a balance in the relationship that I enjoyed. Mashiro, the impulsive and immature chibi (likely will have the most fans), and Benio, the severe siscon honour student, provide most of the comedy and steal the show. Altogether, a charming but unoriginal cast which could of been better if the central leads held a stronger presence.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Now for the main question; is it enjoyable? If you&#039;re a big fan of this genre then certainly yes. If you aren&#039;t then you&#039;ll most definitely feel that time was wasted. Engaged to the Unidentified does not offer anything new or exciting but still delivers well for its kind. One complaint i&#039;m sure many people have voiced is the pacing. For the first half, almost nothing happens in regards to advancing the story. Confusing it for a cute girls doing cute things anime wouldn&#039;t be confound at all. As for the romance, it hints here and there as the show progresses and doesn&#039;t really blossom until very late. It&#039;s cute, awkward and pure but it won&#039;t get your heart racing. People who have seen plenty of SoL will be accustomed to the turtle like pacing but those who are romance veterans that delight in more passionate relationships will probably find themselves bored stiff.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Engaged to the Unidentified is a very solid series. If you&#039;re not looking for anything serious and just want to chill out to something cute (did I forget to mention that?) and dainty then absolutely give this a try. Compared to other shows of this type, there wasn&#039;t much about it that stood out apart from the twist half way but that couldn&#039;t save this series from being just a regular SoL rom-com.

    It seems that ‘16’ is a magic number for most girls, as in a special moment where something must happen that makes their Birthday to be unforgettable. Most times anyways, it’s just any normal day for people. But in this show, that’s not exactly the case when Kobeni Yonomori finds out that she is to be engaged with her arranged fiance Hakuya Mitsumine. As a little bonus, Hakuya also brings his younger sister Mashiro to spice up the family. <br />
<br />
The concept no doubt comes firsthand as being cliché. We have the golden trio of the show that plays on the norms of the normal, popular,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141793">
        and cute girl. Then, there’s the main male protagonist Hakuya with an apathetic outlook on life. Taken for granted, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (Engaged to the Unidentified) comes off as a show that isn’t particular outstanding judging from its outer shell. Yet, the story itself is crafted with a clever way of delivery. In retrospect, it’s a romantic comedy with a simple premise involving an arranged marriage. There’s certain degrees of development between the characters as we learn about their true origins. By their origins, it’s noticeable to point out that some aren’t actually humans. More importantly however is how they fit into society and demonstrates human behavior. <br />
<br />
Development comes from the foundation of its characters. The character cast is small yet colorful. The core of the show involves Kobeni and her new circumstances as a young girl. She just turned sixteen, which by most law sets the standards for a working girl in society. Yet, her circumstance skips that phase and goes towards marriage, an abrupt event that can change most people’s lives. After all, marriage calls for responsibilities for young women like never before. Yet, Kobeni is able to still continue life thanks to the support of others. One of them is her older sister Benio. Coming off as an elegant lady on the outside, she is viewed as an idol at school. Yet at home, she has a bizarre attraction towards the youngest in the household, Mashiro. Being only nine years old, Mashiro often wants to be noticed and demands others to see her not as a child, but as an authoritative figure. Finally, our main male protagonist Hakuya is the aloof young man without much words but holds some wisdom for the family. There’s an odd degree of mixture with these characters since none of them really are compatible with each other. Yet, they hold the show together in a laudable way with their influence. Despite not even noticing it, their actions leads to results and often bring together episodes of embellishment. This can either be in the way of drama, comedy, or story development. In essence, the characters can be quite easily to get attached to thanks to their diverse personalities. Hell, even the parents make their memorable moments despite their relatively short time on the show.<br />
<br />
As the story progresses, we learn more about what happened in the past with clever usage of flashbacks. They give clues with foreshadowing details relating to the main premise of the story. More importantly is how our characters responds to them, especially in the case for Kobeni. Developments takes unusual turns with romance angles and characterization. In fact, we learn more about the characters through their interactions. The story also deals with supernatural elements, another unusual gag used for such a lighthearted story. While lacking the shounen action one might hope for, it makes it up with its energy. Mashiro in particular is like a light bulb that shines with ebullience. Similarly, her interaction with Benio will evoke amusing reactions given their complete opposite characteristics. <br />
<br />
Being a romantic comedy, there’s a presence of romance developing. Unfortunately, Hakuya tends to be a character that lacks any exquisite attributes. He’s not the bachelor type or someone people see as a hero or sex idol. Instead, Hakuya is a quiet young man that often keeps words to himself. Yet when the situation calls for it, he is able to enter a conflict and tries to formulate a civil solution to bring peace. Of course, his past is a big point to the story involving him and Kobeni during their childhood. A love triangle also develops in later episodes involving a supporting character that causes trouble. She brings not only drama but some nuisance for the family because of her obsession with Benio, minor feelings for Hakuya, and rivalry with Mashiro. But as far as romance goes, most parts is still lighthearted and somewhat realistic. However at the same time, it’s predictable judging by Kobeni’s interactions with Hakuya. We also get unusual responses from Benio, the oldest sister of the family. She breaks out of her usual comfort zone and displays of annoyance towards their engagement. Hakuya also shows more of his character as he becomes more and more involved with his decisions rather than just being a standard yes man.<br />
<br />
Comedy exists throughout the series in a variety of ways. They can come with mixed bags depending on how one perceives its execution. However on most parts, I find the comedy to be cleverly executed. Thanks to our main characters, there’s a fun mood in the show despite the tense premise. Mashiro is the mascot with her attempt to act like an adult despite being a kid. She can yell, wear adorable outfits, has a huge sweet tooth, and can dance melodiously in front of a television. Her fear for Benio is what really brings out the humor of the show. Yet, this can also become drawback for viewers who sees Benio’s tactics to get Mashiro’s attention to be repetitive. It’s hard to not see Benio going full lolicon on Mashiro. Also, fan service is minimal and there’s not much of it with even the absence of a beach or onsen episode. Camera angles aren’t suggestive and neither does skin show for any of the girls except in perhaps the main opening sequences. Rather, the series brings together more of an unusual romance comedy rather than an asinine sweet 16.<br />
<br />
Despite the bizarreness of the presentation, there are some parts that can be dull. Hakuya in particular is a character that is hard to get used to or be relatable mostly because of his little presence. The love angle between him and Kobeni can also come off quasi with lack of sensation. Even with development, the duo doesn’t stand out much mostly because of their silent personalities. Most supporting characters only play minor parts with only one girl that makes quite the drama. Additionally, most episodes doesn’t take itself outside the home or school setting. It lacks a degree in diversity as to other locations being explored in their neighborhood. And even so, neither is their home or school distinctive in any way.<br />
<br />
There’s also interesting aspects to the artwork style. Characters are designed with cuteness and simplicity. Mashiro in particular is a girl that stands out with her short stature and hair that seems to almost have a life of its own. Kobeni’s innocence is also portrayed well for a young girl that doesn’t go with social conformity such as putting on heavy makeup or spending hours in the bathroom doing their hair. The backgrounds are also aesthetic and comedic scenes adapts itself with clever usage of its visuals. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack has a casual tone with its OST. It’s easy to take notice of the slice of life tone with director Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, previously involved with GJ-Club. Hence, experience some of the lighthearted background music that is coordinated with various scenes. It’s also noticeable that on many occasions, there is no OST playing in the background at all in order to illustrate a sense of realism. Characters’ voice mannerisms fits well on some parts, although Mashiro’s voice can come as both cute yet fluffy at times. Yuri Yoshida voices her character who is a rather fresh face in the VA industry that may take some time to get used to. Otherwise, Hakuya’s voice is hardly outstanding and some of his dialogues come off as monotonous as if he’s reading off some textbook. On the other hand, embrace the OP and ED song for its catchy tone and bouncy sequences. <br />
<br />
Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is more of a show for one’s self-indulgence. It will take a little time to get used to but the pleasure of enjoying this show is worth it for its characters. Even the story comes together with unusual gags despite the quasi-like clichés. The show does have some frivolous comedy and moments where it does seem repetitive. Additionally, some characters might also might strike a few nerves with their personification. In fact, to enjoy this show will take patience but in the end will be a fun ride if your mind is up for it. <br />

    This is, perhaps, the first slice of life anime series to finish in this winter season. And Dogakobo had, yet again, brought out another good anime for us to watch.<br />
<br />
When I watched the first episode of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I thought that it would have a great story and I felt that it would be the best romcom anime for the season. But unfortunately, I wasn’t finding that expectation I wanted. Here’s why.<br />
<br />
The story revolved around the Yonomori sisters, Kobeni and Benio, and the Mitsumine siblings, Hakuya and Mashiro. Akane, who is the Yonomori sisters’ mom, announced that Kobeni was somewhat engaged to Hakuya by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137197">
        her grandpa during her 16th birthday. Apparently, Kobeni had met Hakuya before during childhood, but it seemed that she forgot who he was.<br />
<br />
So why did my expectation failed? It can be summed up in one word, which is “tropes”. They are everywhere in the anime, mainly the story and the characters. It made the story a bit clichéd, and the characters similar to others.<br />
<br />
However, it didn’t really matter much, because there are some points in the story which made the story more interesting. Indeed, there is a small surprise that developed it from a few characters. There is also a backstory between Kobeni and Hakuya as well. The romance, although not bringing enough impact to me, is cute. There are times when Kobeni showed her “dere” side sometimes to Hakuya, while there are other times when she wanted Hakuya to stop acting “cutesy-lovely” to her. Eventually, the relationship actually developed.<br />
<br />
The ending is a bit satisfactory, as it ended the story where the characters continued to carry out their lives.<br />
<br />
The anime has characters with the typical tropes. Benio is a student council president who excels in academics and sports and is adored by many students. Mashiro is a child who acts like a teenager. Hakuya is a quiet guy who is always emotionless. Kobeni has great figures, mentioned by some characters, and is great at housework and cooking. There are other characters, such as Konoha, a member in the student council, who has feelings for Benio, and Shirayuki, mom of the Mitsumine siblings, who looked like a loli. <br />
<br />
I feel that there’s isn’t much character development in all except Hakuya and Kobebi, but it is a slice of life anyway. But all these characters are interesting. Some of them showed their emotions well to execute something.<br />
<br />
The opening is totally superb. It has a great upbeat and is sung by the seiyuus of the three main girls in the anime. They also sang the ending, which is more relaxed but still enjoyable. The art style is awesome, although not really important at all. The scenery is just spectacular. The character designs have the moe feel, and the facial expressions do exaggerate, all of this to make a great comedy.<br />
<br />
Although the story and characters are the anime’s weakest points, I still enjoyed the anime nevertheless. It may not be the best romcom of the season, but it is good enough. Sweet cute romance is enjoyable for me already.<br />
<br />
I heard that the anime’s first volume sale was great so far. I hoped that this continues onwards with the other volumes, and maybe we might expect a second season. There are two OVAs, where one of them is already released but not subbed. It’s just typical scenes of the onsen and night-walk.

    So we have a slife of life romance about dogs and people or is it... i wouldnt know BECAUSE THEY NEVER ACTUALLY TURN INTO DOGS. Now ima get this out of the way really fast, this does not affect the score in any way but ill just say this. If you have an anime where your main characters are not human but take the form of humans THEN SHOW US WHAT THEY REALLY ARE it just satisfies the need to know i mean i still dont know if there dogs, not dogs, half dogs, wheredog. This title translates to, engaged to the unidenitified and good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139715">
        lord unidentified is what they are.  Like spare 2 frames to show us the main character as a dog whats wrong with you, you cruel bastard <br />
Kay now that that&#039;s out of the way let&#039;s get on with this bleh anime. So first off the plot of this anime seemed very promising, i like innocent rom-coms where you have a cute relationship but nay in the end i was sorely mistaken since relationship is the last thing any characters in the anime have because the whole anime is just her asking herself do i really love him. That&#039;s it that&#039;s the whole anime  i mean &quot;what about that whole him being a dog&quot; well curious reader that has no relevance to anything and might as well have not even been true &quot;what about her being half dog&quot; others would ask, well i would say that goes no where but that would be an understatement that would mean admitting it happened but really nothing happened they just said she&#039;s kinda sorta 1/10th dog and thats it. It has no relevance to anything.  We end the anime where we started it, a brother and a sister living with the brothers fiancee who may or may not like him. so ya plot.<br />
Characters so first we have Hakuya who is as much of a main character as the sticks he uses to build houses. He has no personality or development as a character. He is just there to be fawned upon and to get some not funny jokes in. Next we have Mashiro the token loli character. She is just there for humor as well really and she isnt very funny. She&#039;s kinda just the centor of the comedy along with Benio and is boring to watch. There is Kobeni who is just the most boring character to watch like my god her dialogue can be summed up in do i love him do i not love him it&#039;s not very deep and she also gets no character development. Then we have Benio who is one of the most annoying characters in anime, not much more to say. Then there&#039;s the supporting cast who support a bunch of twigs with one punch line written on them so really as to be expected they are just smaller twigs with one punch line written on them. None of them are even funny punch lines. Insestual love for you sister is not funny it&#039;s just stupid. In the end this anime is just a bunch of not funny nothing that starts with nothing and amounts to nothing with a whole lot of nothing in between. if you enjoy the three jokes this anime has to offer enough that you could listen to them till judgment day than enjoy. <br />
I gave this anime a 3 for the amount of jokes it had.

    I have watched 47 anime shows (completed) and I never really bothered to write reviews. However, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei lit a spark in me. Inspired me to write about it, I suppose. <br />
<br />
~Story~ (9/10)<br />
<br />
        Nowadays the typical idea for manga is that the characters suddenly meet. I got used to that and honestly, that was what I was expecting. However, in this case it is different. 16 year olds Hakuya and Kobeni find themselves caught in an arranged marriage. It was set up by Kobeni&#039;s deceased grandfather. As some shows do: Hakuya moves in with Kobeni. He has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174247">
        a sister named Mashiro who tries to act grown up (despite being ten years old herself) and a crazy sister-in-law named Benio who&#039;s more then a little protective of Kobeni and has a little bit of a complex. There&#039;s more then what meets the eye for this show. In the beginning it stole my heart when they hit it right off the bat with a romantic moment in episode one. (Under the first ten minutes, too!) I&#039;m a huge fan of fantasy and shows that involve magic. Especially the light-hearted kind. I was highly amused when little Mashiro managed to score herself a spot in high school. I won&#039;t say why but I know you can connect the dots. The story had much promise and it turned out well but I felt they rushed it at the end. No &quot;I love you&quot;, no visiting your in-law&#039;s house. I was hoping for some hilarious situations and maybe even rings for Kobeni and Hakuya. (They are engaged, right?) Besides that, I felt it was amazing and deserved the 9/10 I gave it. <br />
<br />
~Art~ 8/10<br />
 <br />
          I&#039;m a pretty honest person. So I&#039;ll admit that when I noticed Kobeni had a bust, I groaned and looked down at my own chest. The story followed with Kobeni having issues with her body and her allegedly &quot;good child bearing&quot; hips. All in all, they drew the women pretty decently and it made sense. (Though for Kobeni&#039;s mom, I felt a little envious of her bust. That&#039;s all I&#039;ll say.) There&#039;s only one boy as Kobeni&#039;s father nor Hakuya&#039;s is drawn in. Hakuya is drawn (dare I say) a little better then Kobeni. He looks a little older, and he is taller. He looks a little better and to me it seems the animators were a little more diligent. It seemed they tried to fulfil the whole highschooler who&#039;s a boy = good looking idea. The backgrounds were stunning (especially trees and some buildings) and even the background characters caught my eye. The animators seemed quite diligent there too. (I&#039;ve seen animes where the background people are lumps coloured in odd colours. It&#039;s great to see that they tried. <br />
<br />
~Sound~ 7/10<br />
<br />
          Don&#039;t get me wrong, I loved the opening and ending. The songs were adorable and light hearted. I just felt that sometimes they could have tried a bit harder. (Fine, I just wanted a &quot;DUH DUH DUH&quot; like in the horror movies for when Benio got shocked.) <br />
<br />
~Character~ 7/10<br />
<br />
      I loved each of the characters. From Kobeni&#039;s mother to Nadeshiko (Benio&#039;s student council friend with the brown hair.) I felt that they were all well developed, all had good attitudes. The only issue I had was how they interacted with one another. Take Mashiro and Konoha (one of Benio&#039;s many adoring fans and a student council member) for example. Their fighting was repetitive and really the same. I never really liked their fighting because it never really contributed to the story. Also take Kobeni and Hakuya for an example. Throughout the story I felt the spark but never much to confirm it. Sure, Hakuya did something romantic in the last ten or so minutes of the last episode for Kobeni but that&#039;s it. I had hopes for those two because he&#039;d done something sweet in the first so I wanted that to progress. It did emotionally but I&#039;m a fangirl and I need something to squeal about. I loved the story but they never even held hands or kissed. It hurt me a little bit. <br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~ 9/10<br />
        <br />
         As I mentioned before, it was hilarious all the same. Funny moments to moments where I fell over laughing. I loved the show&#039;s lightheartedness and I was shocked when I got to the last episode. It had just zoomed past me and left me aching for more. I loved it. <br />
<br />
~Overall~ 8/10<br />
<br />
          Sure, it had some issues but I did truly enjoy it. No show is perfect and it&#039;s great that this one came close. <br />
<br />
I hope this was helpful! If you like comedy, a touch of fantasy and romance, this is the show for you!!

    Ugh, romantic comedies. They are usually a mix of romance, slice of life and, of course, comedy. I’m not a particular fan of any of theses genres, as Romeo x Juliet, Yuyushiki, and a number of other anime have successfully proven to me. If I dislike all these genres, why on Earth would I like something that is a combination of all three? The pleasant surprise of Chu-2 gave me hope for rom-coms, however, and I’m pleased to say that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei held up my expectations.<br />
<br />
MdS is about a girl called Kobeni, who on her sixteenth birthday is suddenly told that she is engaged

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164067">
        to the mysterious Hakuya. Not very original, huh? I can imagine that people would be a little bored just by reading the summary and thus reluctant to watch this. <br />
MdS is not anime to be watched if you are searching for a fresh plot that has plenty of twists and turns. The premise, along with some other elements, is quite generic, maybe even a little stale. However, if you get past that, and rather concentrate on the way the story is told, focusing on the characters and the humour, you’ll realise that MdS is an interesting and very enjoyable anime. <br />
<br />
Watching MdS was somewhat… refreshing. As I said, the plot is not original, but it’s told in such a light-hearted and humorous way that you can’t help but like it. It masks the cliches and the ‘I’ve-seen-this-a-million-times-already’ moments so well that you don’t even realise that they’re there, save for a few moments that don’t hinder the enjoyment in the slightest. I usually hate romance anime because the romance is so soppy, slice-of-life is usually so boring that I can’t force myself to watch it any more, and comedy elements are usually entirely characters being dumb, slapstick, or the old manzai layout with the bokes and the tsukkomi. I felt none of this repugnance in MdS. I was cheering for Kobeni x Hakuya all the way and found the little romantic actions unbelievably cute. Their relationship is really well paced, too. As slice-of-life anime often go, after watching a few episodes, I asked myself what actually happened in the 2 hours or so that I&#039;d watched so far, but it just didn&#039;t bother me because, hey, I had fun. The comedy revolved mainly around Benio and Mashiro, and was at times subject to the usual exaggerations that I don’t like, but no episode failed to make me laugh. The events and relations between the characters and just so relatable, even if few of us have been plunged into an engagement planned by our relatives. Even fewer of us have known people who aren’t really human, but the way the characters react mirrors how most of us would probably react. <br />
In short, the plot line of MdS really accentuated everything that I like about anime - the great story telling, as well as the fun of it. <br />
<br />
The characters are definitely the strongest point of the anime. They’re just all so loveable, and every extra minute they’re on screen only adds to the overall greatness. Similarly to the plot line, there are some stereotypical elements in their personalities, but their highly amusing personal quirks and characteristics simply drowned this out. Let’s take Kobeni. She&#039;s the average high schooler that we’ve seen so much before, with slightly low self-esteem, but at the same time, parts of her mindset are completely different from... pretty much every other female lead I&#039;ve seen up till now. She is the first anime girl that I’ve seen who is self-conscious about her figure and wants a smaller bust. All females I have seen till now are perfectly slender and find being flat-chested a curse. Kobeni does have rather big breasts - something which is pointed out a few times in the anime - so maybe it is our human nature to want everything we don’t have, but still, this was just such a relief. There’s a lot more to her though, but I won’t elaborate too much. The way the seemingly stoic Hakuya’s emotions are portrayed are definitely giggle-inducing, and despite being apathetic most of the time, he can be amusing. Mashiro is by far the cutest character, mature for her age… but not completely. And for once, there are actually adults living in Japan.<br />
Benio and Suetsugi let the cast down a little. They’re both amusing characters, but they were blatantly stereotypical. Benio’s little sister complex and popularity were over the top, dragging away in an unneeded fashion from the realism of the anime. She also broke the fourth wall a number of times (“this reeks of love comedy”). Suetsugi&#039;s yandere-like love towards Benio was a little annoying. <br />
Despite some flaws, all the characters were very loveable and greatly added to the general enjoyment of the anime. <br />
<br />
The art was nothing special, but it was really well done. The character designs were very well done, and the general drawing style was really appealing. There were some flaws, notably the chibi-like feet at times, without the actual details of the shoe, or Mashiro&#039;s dress alternating between blue and green, but apart from that, the art was fine. Good backgrounds, good characters. When I think of anime, this kind of art pops to mind. <br />
<br />
Voice acting was really well done. The voices suited the characters so much. They didn’t sound overly emotional, kids didn’t sound like adults, etc. Once again, this is the type of voice acting that I expect from anime. My main complaint would be Mashiro’s voice. It bothered me a little at first, since it sounds obviously fake, like the voice actress was voicing with cotton balls or the likes in her mouth in attempt to sound ‘cute’. It wasn&#039;t like that all the time, though, and I soon came to like it. Benio’s voice in particular was really well done.  <br />
There wasn’t that much background music, which is a bit of a shame, because the bgm tracks were quite nice. The OP and ED are one of the better ones I’ve seen so far. I usually skip the OP, but in MdS I listened through it every episode. The ED was cute and well done as well. I would have listened through it every time as well if I wasn’t so eager to get on to the next episode. <br />
In summary, the music that this anime had was really nice, but there should have been more.<br />
 <br />
<br />
If I had to summarise Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I would have to say: simple, but fun.<br />
This anime was by no means flawless. It does have some stereotypical and failed-comedy elements. However, it is so enjoyable, the characters are so loveable, that it outweighs the flaws. I really enjoyed it, and finished it within 2 days. The ending is very open, so I’m in high hopes that we’ll get a second season!<br />
<br />
Let me just finish off by saying that for me, contrary to most other anime I’ve watched, first impressions were correct. If you don’t like the first few episodes, this anime is not for you. <br />
<br />
Even if you’re not a huge fan of rom-coms, like me, I still suggest you give Mikakunin de Shinkoukei a try!<br />

    hmm, since this is my first time to create a review of an anime, it might as well be an anime that I enjoyed!<br />
<br />
&quot;Papapara♪ papa♪ oh-oh♪ papapara♪ pa♪ yeah-yeah♪!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mikakunin de Shinkoukei&quot; or in English &quot; Engaged to the Unidentified&quot; at first glance this might be another romantic comedy about a girl who just turned 16 years old and suddenly she was informed that she had a fiance that will be living with her but I&#039;m gonna tell you in advance, DO NOT JUDGE AN ANIME BY ITS SYNOPSIS or the first 4 episode (it’s one of my golden rule). You will be surprised at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171083">
        the end that this is a good RomCom.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
Well the story goes as the title of the anime says &quot;Engaged to the Unidentified&quot;. It follows Yonomori, Kobeni and her daily life with her fiance that she just met, Mitsume, Hakuya , or so she thought. The story line is pretty common with other Romantic Comedies like this which are the girl meets her unknown fiance and as the story goes on they fall in love with each other. However what sets this anime different is that the development or the progress of their relationship is faster than other RomCom but at the same time gives a convincing bond between Kobeni and Hakuya. Next would be is how they deliver those cliches, they all delivered it well and in a funny way that anyone could enjoy.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
 <br />
Since I am not an artist, I will just say it&#039;s nice. I mean it&#039;s not bad at all but not that remarkable either and before you think its mediocre, let me just tell you it&#039;s not or at least I think it is. Though I could say the art is normal it could really deliver the emotions and atmosphere it wants to deliver like when its serious it gets a little dark and when romantic it get bright and fluffy.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
&quot;Papapara♪ papa♪ oh-oh♪ papapara♪ pa♪ yeah-yeah♪!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes the opening is addicting as cocaine or for my geek friends Pokemon.<br />
It one of those song that so catchy it will haunt in your dream like what happened to me! Anyways, the opening and ending are both great and one of this anime&#039;s best strength.  IT WILL ALSO GET STUCK IN YOUR MIND!!!<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
You would normally think that all the characters will be linear or copy-paste personalty on a other RomCom characters but you will be sorta wrong.<br />
Well I did say sorta because the sub-characters are as stereotype as you can get. I feel like they are there just for gags you know extra when the plot needs humor or help sometimes. Then you have the main cast:<br />
<br />
Kobeni Yonomori- the lucky sweet 16 girl who got a fiance for her birthday. <br />
She is a all around nice girl and could be a serious hard-working wife when she needs to. Though you would say that there is no problem with her, she has a inferiority complex with her sister which she thinks she is lower than her.<br />
<br />
Hakuya Mitsumine- An emotionless character at first that has actually have a character. He is also the one that deliver the cliche line of RomCom male protagonist yet it work, props to him, CHEERS!.<br />
<br />
Mashiro Mitsumine- The Obligatory loli of the series because MOE! Nonetheless she is not useless because she helps the relationship of his brother, Hakuya, and gives humor to the story as well. <br />
<br />
Benio Yonomori-  The Obligatory crazy sister of Kobeni because what will a RomCom be without a crazy sister, ....a slice of life or sitcom. However she is actually a likable character because she cares about her sister and she gives the best gags and comebacks in the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
The shows strong points are its Romance and Comedy which is to be expected because it is a Romcom. Personally I enjoy the 4th wall breaks of Benio and the Hakuya x Kobeni moments. However as much as I like the show it still has some flaws and a big one for me also. I don&#039;t want to spoil anyone so I will just say it as a plot device. That PLOT DEVICE IS UNNECESSARY, I mean you could do the same thing without it or even better. It only caused unnecessary conflict between Kobeni and Hakuya. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
Positive<br />
-Good Romance and Comedy<br />
-Really addicting opening like seriously its like &quot;under the sea&quot; of Little Mermaid<br />
-Great main cast<br />
<br />
Negative<br />
-UNNECESSARY PLOT DEVICE!!!!!!!<br />
-weak minor characters<br />
<br />

    This anime was cute, yet frustrating. The main characters that are engaged never actually get any alone time to talk to each other and when they do, Kobeni just mumbles and doesn&#039;t actually talk about anything.<br />
<br />
The story was very vague and didn&#039;t have any strong points and was disappointing. The ending was a let down in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The art was very good, Kobeni is one of the cutest girls in anime, and each character is very well animated, and the settings are done decently. The characters are the strongest point in the art department.<br />
<br />
The sound was pretty cute. They had little piano parts here and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202051">
        there and funny music. Reminded my of Kirby&#039;s Epic Yarn at some points actually.<br />
<br />
The Characters don&#039;t ever develop. They stay very much the same throughout the entire show. Hakuya never speaks for himself, Kobeni never reacts the way you want her too, Benio was funny at first but then it gets super old, and Mashiro never leaves Kobeni or Hakuya alone.<br />
<br />
Overall it was a little disappointing with some cuteness mixed in, and it wasn&#039;t worth it but it wasn&#039;t awful. I&#039;d suggest looking elsewhere if you&#039;re looking for a romance anime, because I&#039;m sure most would have more romance than this one.

    Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a slice of life romantic comedy that only recently aired, didn&#039;t receive much attention and is adapted from a lesser-known manga. <br />
However, under all the obscurity lies quite the gem of a show. While it doesn&#039;t fit everyone&#039;s tastes, especially if you are averse to SoL or romantic comedy, Mikakunin certainly delivers on what it aspires to be. It doesn&#039;t try to change up the traditional formula or anything fancy, but what it does attempt is executed charmingly.<br />
<br />
The story follows the daily life and escapades of Kobeni Yonomori and her family. Many of the scenes are your typical high school slice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139967">
        of life antics. While they are very tried-and-true, the segments(especially the reactions) are very funny and give each character moments in the spotlight. There was a little plot twist close to the middle of the series, but it could have easily been written differently with little impact on the outcome. However, the plot twist is somewhat subtly foreshadowed and is worked into the main storyline effectively. <br />
Essentially, the plot can be boiled down to &quot;Kobeni and Hakuya slowly developing their relationship together&quot;. It is a simplistic plot, but personally I would not have it any other way. There&#039;s no dithering, no serious love triangles that lead to overwhelming tragedy, no &quot;I need to make a choice&quot; or whatever. The relationship is already set at the very beginning, and now it&#039;s the characters&#039; turn to make it grow. It&#039;s the simple story of two people slowly falling in love, and that&#039;s what makes it beautiful.<br />
<br />
The art style is one of the nicest things about this show as well. The characters mostly give off a sense of reality, that these people could be real. They are styled in typical fashion, but not outlandishly cute or anything like that. The proportions are very realistic and help just a little in getting into the show. Adding to that are the background art and environments, which are beautifully designed and a pleasure to look at. The school is your standard anime high school, but the city and mountain scenery are very well done and add to the ambient feel. Topping it off is the animation, which is very fluid and somewhat more natural compared to many other series. It&#039;s not over-the-top 60 frames per second quality, but that kind of quality would detract from the series as a simpler and more realistic show, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
An oddity about this series, however, is that there is a noticeable lack of background music during many scenes. Some people may find this a little jarring, being used to background music playing during most scenes during a show. I found it a little jarring the first couple episodes myself. In spite of that, I do feel that the lack of BGM doesn&#039;t really take too much away from the show. It allows some of the scenes to showcase what&#039;s happening onscreen without necessarily needing BGM to immerse the watcher, and it also reflects reality somewhat since most of the time background music won&#039;t be playing while things happen. The background music mostly boils down to personal preference; if you prefer to have BGM to immerse yourself in the show, the lack of it during some scenes will hurt this show&#039;s impact on you somewhat. The opening and ending songs are rather fluffy and addicting, however, and I think I can safely say that most people will enjoy them. They also fit the tone of the show very well and are good songs in their own right. <br />
<br />
The characters, while not featuring anyone who really breaks the mold of the traditional archetypes commonly found in slice of life/rom-com anime, work fairly well together and don&#039;t really have any serious flaws in them. Kobeni, our main female lead, is a cute teenager &quot;with a great rack and child-bearing hips&quot; who is often the face of sanity among the cast. Hakuya, our main male lead, is a quiet guy who speaks little but shows more than tells, which is a quality I appreciate among characters. Mashiro is the childish comic forever at odds with Benio, Kobeni&#039;s older sister who is...erm, rather perverted. The main four characters above get at least some development and/or shown to have hidden depths, which is very nice. Some potential pitfalls, however, is that the development itself is rather gradual and not entirely explicit, and a couple characters can be a little annoying at times. I personally found Benio rather grating occasionally, since a few parts of her character are highly exaggerated and are brought to the fore. She also has a tendency to interrupt something important, which can be annoying. However, the show does put on display another side to Benio beyond what is presented normally, which does help to balance and flesh out her character, but she can still be rather annoying at times. <br />
<br />
Personally, I love this work above many of the more recent SoL/rom-coms that I&#039;ve seen in the past couple years. That is not to say I didn&#039;t like the others, just that Mikakunin left a big impression on me. As a guy almost in his 20s who has never had a girlfriend in his life, I&#039;d say that there are few romantic SoL comedies where I could say &quot;Man, I hope any future relationship I have could be somewhat like this&quot;. Mikakunin de Shinkoukei qualifies to be among those select few in my book. I found the growing relationship and eventual love that the main couple develop over the series to be very sweet and heartwarming to watch, and for me, that was the greatest gift I could have gotten from taking the six hours or so I needed to watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a solid Slice of Life romantic comedy that, in my opinion, deserves more attention than it got or currently gets. It is not an anime that appeals to everyone; for people who are looking for something earthshattering in the genre or for people who dislike either SoL or romantic comedy antics, this show is not your cup of tea. Mikakunin doesn&#039;t pull any new fancy tricks out of the Slice of Life hat. What it does do, however, is execute the tried-and-true forms very well and tie them all together into a very sweet and heartwarming story. For SoL and rom-com fans, people looking to try something new, or for somebody just looking for a sweet and relaxing story to pick up, I ask you to try Mikakunin and experience it for yourselves. It isn&#039;t perfect-I don&#039;t think any anime ever will be-but I certainly hope you prospective viewers would come to enjoy and love Mikakunin de Shinkoukei as much as I did and still do.

    HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KOBENI!  Every girl dreams of their sweet 16th.  (I&#039;m only assuming here.)  And so, what better way to celebrate your entry into womanhood...by giving you a brand new, totally unexpected and uncalled for, fiance and sister-in-law as a present!  Today, the anime is Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, or, Engaged to the Unidentified in english translation.  Let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
Story (7.31/10):  The story is essentially what I had in my intro.  Our main protagonist Kobeni, who has reached the age of 16, has now received a fiance by the name of Hakuya, and a sister in law by the name

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137385">
        of Mashiro.  It is from then on that Kobeni lives with these two, with the whole timespan of the anime explaining their daily life.  Overall, the plot is extremely simple, and quite bland as an idea standpoint cause it literally is a slice of life that talks about daily life.  But, this series does have its interesting and amusing quirks to it, that make it so much better.<br />
<br />
The plot of Mikakunin has several twists and turns in and of itself.  In very unexpected times, our main protagonist learns new things about our new residents and has to cope with these new changes, as most of them pertain to an event that occurred several years prior to the story.  Yes, this anime does have a backstory, and not one that&#039;s particularly flushed out.  It&#039;s explained to a certain extent, but not to one where you know the whole story and you can make connections.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the whole &quot;serious&quot; parts of the anime, (which actually add a good amount of depth into it), the anime is predominantly light-hearted comedy.  The comedy of the series is actually quite refreshing and good for a nice laugh.  The thing is, it&#039;s just so casual with it, that the series doesn&#039;t even need to try to be funny with itself, because they practically devote an entire character to it.  (I&#039;ll get to that later.)  <br />
<br />
The ending of the series was a rather simple and somewhat open-ended one.  Personally, I would&#039;ve like a more closing and more absolute end due to the fact that it didn&#039;t really solve anything, and it was actually quite abrupt.  It worked as something that resembled an ending, I suppose.  I didn&#039;t like it as much though.<br />
<br />
Though the actual plot idea is a reused piece that many of us have probably seen, the actual execution was rather pleasant and enjoyable.  It&#039;s not the OMG you have to watch this anime of the year, but for what it&#039;s worth, it&#039;s pretty enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Overview<br />
<br />
+  Good comedy<br />
+  Good pacing (except for the final episode)<br />
+  Good depth to the characters mixed in<br />
-   Abrupt and unsatisfactory end<br />
-   Reused plot idea<br />
<br />
Characters (7.89/10):  Now, the characters.  For one thing, the gender ratio is like 1:8 for guys to girls.  I&#039;m not even joking.  This anime isn&#039;t a harem, but I mean, come on.  <br />
<br />
Hakuya Mitsumine.  Now, as the only guy that exists in this anime period, I was somewhat disappointed with how he was created.  For starters, this guy shows no emotion.  He&#039;s a kuudere.  His only method to show the audience if he&#039;s happy, sad, depressed, or what have you, is by flashing a very ornate and colorful background depending on what mood he is.  (i.e.  Flowers when he&#039;s happy, and the blue, depressing lines when he&#039;s sad.)  As a character though, he&#039;s rather blunt in terms of speaking out what he wants to think.  Out of the four main characters, he gets the least amount of lines out of all of them, even though he&#039;s the reason why our main female is in this predicament in the first place.  Though gradually, his character is explored a bit more to help Kobeni&#039;s development, Hakuya himself gets jack.  It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t like him per say, but the fact that he gets so little development or expression as a character, since he&#039;s the only guy, is rather disappointing.<br />
<br />
So, now that we have all of the male characters out of the way, (god that&#039;s depressing.), now onto the real focus of the show, the main females!<br />
<br />
Kobeni Yonomori is the main protagonist of this fine little series.  Her character is heavily based on the perfect waifu archtype, as she is respectful to everyone in the series, she loves cooking, does the laundry, cleans the house, and basically any house duty needs, she can do it.  Not to mention she has the biggest bust out of all the females in the series, as mentioned many times by various other characters.  What is the key thing to know about her character, is the fact that she has several tendencies throughout the series.  Those tendencies being sick quite often, and blaming herself for any issues that come up.  She out of the whole cast gets the most development, as she starts to understand what her life really is in terms of the people around her.  She grows quite attached to the people around her, and I see her as a very honest character in general.  That being said, this development literally only appears in the very last episode, and it felt somewhat pointless to me to do a development to this degree at the END of the series.  Putting it a few episodes back, or even sprinkling it over the course of the whole series would&#039;ve been better.<br />
<br />
Mashiro Mitsumine is the fan favorite of this show, and for good reason.  Mashiro is presented as a proud character with the mindset of a child, (cause she&#039;s still like 10.)  Mostly, she&#039;s is the shows great focus in terms of situational humor due to the fact that she gets amazed and pleased by many different things and sweets, as well as being the one to point out the obvious most of the time, that the other characters don&#039;t really notice.  Above all, she acts as a &quot;big sister&quot; to Hakuya, trying to get her brother and his fiance closer together.  She doesn&#039;t get very much development, (beyond obtaining an obsession over aliens), but she makes up a great deal of that by just being a very enjoyable character.  Not to mention, her voice actress is a newcomer to the voice acting game, who does an incredibly good job of nailing the character in every aspect.  (I pray she gets more roles.)<br />
<br />
And finally, to round out the main characters, ugh...Benio Yonomori.  Benio is the older sister of Kobeni, with an obsession over her little sister/little sisters in general.  (Think of Akaza Akane from Yuru Yuri.  If any of you know that show.)  She is shown in the series to have two personas; one with a studious and looked up to personality at school where she is the student body president, and a model student, and the other one where she obsesses over her little sister (and later on, Mashiro), to the point of I think almost assaulting them.  Benio is the where the majority of the comedy comes from, as her obsessive personality make the series a hell of a lot more hilarious and enjoyable when it comes down to it.  While she&#039;s not my favorite character, she does make the show a lot more interesting.  Although, she kind of becomes obsolete towards the end of the series, which is actually kind of funny.<br />
<br />
Aside from the 4 main characters, we have about 5 or 6 other characters that make up the supporting cast.  2 of which, rarely appear.  The supporting cast is actually rather well tuned to their role, with the majority of them carving a nice niche for them to support the main cast an drive the plot along, and the others having a greater part in this series, i.e. my favorite, Konoha Suetsugi.  <br />
<br />
Overall, while the cast is small, the cast is created tastefully with a wide assortment of characters that never fail to lose interest.  That being said, the &quot;unidentified&quot; part of the title is never really fully explained.  Unless you read on some wiki or do some research yourself, the actually unidentified that is explained in the series is never fully fleshed out.  It is mentioned several times with some good details, but it never REALLY explains it, which is one of the more infuriating things I find.<br />
<br />
Overview<br />
<br />
+  Small cast with decently good development<br />
+  Good slapstick characters<br />
+  Some supporting cast becomes important later on<br />
-   Only one f**king guy in this series!<br />
-   The guy is underdeveloped.  <br />
<br />
Art and Sound (7.98/10):  From an artistic standpoint, this anime does what a lot of anime in this genre do, which is for the most part, switch from its normal animation to chibi, at a moment&#039;s notice.  <br />
<br />
As far as the normal artwork goes, the show is decently detailed with nothing too exceptional in terms of detail.  The characters themselves look rather simple and quite moe heavy.  The color palette that is used comprises of a very white oriented mix of colors where even the black colors used in the show is quite light.  Occasionally, the characters will look quite comical, which from a viewership standpoint adds to the show&#039;s comedy.  <br />
<br />
Now, the music.  I can only say one thing.  How can you not love it?  The OST for the series is very light-hearted and upbeat.  It&#039;s actually not too generic in terms of sound and it&#039;s actually quite a nice listen to and opening for a light hearted series like this.  It&#039;s more or less a stress reliever because it&#039;s just so happy sounding.  <br />
<br />
On the flip side, we have, one of the best ED&#039;s ever in the history of anime.  (I&#039;m serious.)  The whole ED is sung by the voice actress of Mashiro, and the whole thing is essentially a little play in a theater acted out by Mashiro while Kobeni and Benio provide the parts of the vocals in the bottom right hand corner.  Personally, I find this to be one of the most enjoyable ED&#039;s ever because it is literally a show in and of itself.  The music playing is also quite cute as well.<br />
<br />
Overview<br />
<br />
+  Simple and not overly detailed artwork<br />
+  Good transition into comedy scenes<br />
+  Awesomely upbeat music<br />
-   Moe heavy character designs (This is a warning, just in case you don&#039;t like moe)<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9.03/10):  I will admit, I probably enjoy this series WAY more then any guy should.  When I watched this series, I, as always, attempted to find something that differed it from any other Romcom out there.  And in fact, I did.  One thing that I didn&#039;t find while watching this, was any real romance.  Unlike a romance series I recently finished as of the time of this review, the main focus of this show wasn&#039;t primarily based on the actual romance that is &quot;supposed&quot; to be going on.  Rather, it follows a rather happy and calming tale of 4 people living together, with the idea of marriage being in the back of the head.<br />
<br />
The series for me was very enjoyable, and I looked forward to it every week.  It was the culmination of really likable characters, as well as some good twists to the plot, and very funny comedy moments.  Overall, this series is a high on my recommended list for anyone who wants to watch something that is a casual slice of life, while also having a plot to it.  Regardless, I&#039;m still a little pissed off at the fact that they didn&#039;t completely fully explain the &quot;unidentified&quot; part of the series.  <br />
<br />
Overall Score: (8.21/10)

    The show centers around our main character, Kobeni Yonomori, a 16 year old at the start of the series when she finds out that she has been engaged to a boy from the mountains. Thus later that day the boy, who looks considerably older than Kobeni, and his sister, who looks more like an 8 year old drop by. Kobeni&#039;s mother, who for the rest of the series is less than a supporting character, tells her that her grandfather , long dead now, engaged them when she was very little. What follows in the next few episodes is how, Kobeni handles this news, and how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186040">
        she&#039;ll deal with it in school.<br />
Characters: The hallmark of a slice of life show is its characters, and I believe that this series really did when in that department. Kobeni Yonomori, is a timid, busty, housewifey type of 16 year old, for whom cooking, cleaning and laundry are more important that school clubs, and sports, both of which she is quite terrible at. Her sister, Benio Yonomori is the complete opposite, as she is student council president, and is a fantastic athlete, but she hates all things to do with the household, and can&#039;t cook worth beans, seriously well other than steamed buns. Their mother is an equal of Benio, and can&#039;t cook, clean, and is a work-a-holic, her story is not really mentioned in the story. Over all Benio and Mashiro, Kobeni&#039;s set to be future sister-in-law have a really great comedy act, where Benio is trying to fetishize Mashiro, and she is equally strong in her hatred of Benio. <br />
Art &amp; Overall Apperance: This show is wonderfully animated, I mean shirts blowing in the wind, vivid colours, and great character design. Kobeni is set as our main character, but she don&#039;t have any of the &quot;MOE&quot; tendencies, such as clumsiness, I refer to Lucky Star of course, and Ecchi-ness, her busty figure is rarely the center of attention but when it is, it is done pleasantly, not let&#039;s just objectify her entirely. The scenery is also quite well done, and this animation studio, of which I do not know at this time, I will come back to. <br />
Verdict: You want a show you can just enjoy, without any story whatsoever, then this is the show for you! The characters are the main focus here, and the SOL plot is something more unusual than the average run of the mill, and that&#039;s what makes it really bearable. If however, SOL is not something you like then, you will hate this show. Nothing terribly deep happens, hell even remotely deep, at absolutely nothing. Should you watching it, well if you like the shows I like then you&#039;ll love this series, nothing Ecchi, so this definitely recommended to the entire crowd, of all age groups. I really enjoy the physical comedy, and that&#039;s something in the anime I&#039;ve seen, something rare. Give it a try and you&#039;re sure to enjoy this series, of course the re-watch factor is almost nothing, but still very highly recommended<br />
Score: I&#039;m gonna give it a 7/10 cause this show is good, and well made, it accomplished everything it set out to do, and the overall atmosphere was funny and age-appropriate something that is getting harder and harder to find, season after season.

    When something hits you in the face there is nothing you can do except wipe your face and keep going. The same trick applies to facts, you cannot change them once they have occured, you can only accept them and move forward.<br />
<br />
Mikakunin de Shinkoukei follows the story of Kobeni a normal girl with fairly good grades from the point where she is told out of the blue that she is engaged to some guy she does not know named Hakuya. She is worried at first about her future, yet slowly she begins accepting her situation as well as her new guests through a series of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138043">
        amusing situations that mostly involve teasing.<br />
<br />
When you watch this series you notice how good the artwork is when you look at the eyes and the overall shapes of someone as well as the backgrounds which are,in my opinion, well made in comparison to other such series. Colors are enhanced with a shade of white to bring them closer to the fact that it is an animated series.<br />
<br />
Each of the characters are unique in their own way because of their personalities even if at some point they may seem similar, something rather good and expected given the number of characters in the series. As the story evolves they remain constant and act according to their own personalities which is perfectly normal given the fact that this is a comedy series, it is supposed to be funny not amaze people with something new.<br />
<br />
All in all I enjoyed the hilarious scenes in every episode and I would recommend this series for anyone looking for a home-comedy series with a spice of drama.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the time taken to read this review

    I stumbled upon this show the other day and marathoned through it in a couple hours, something I usually don&#039;t do unless I really like the show. Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is pretty much your typical rom com but it&#039;s fairly well done. It&#039;s not mentioned in the genre tags but there are supernatural elements which gives this rom com a little more flare. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
While the plot is sort of generic and has been done a million times before, this series handled it differently than other shows which made it a bit more interesting. Basically, a girl turns 16 and a mysterious guy shows up on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144153">
        her doorstep and turns out to be her fiance, an arranged marriage setup by their grandparents and the girl had no idea. In the typical rom com, the girl will usually be completely against the arranged marriage and the 2 main characters probably hate each other and don&#039;t get along. However, that&#039;s where this show gains some points because they don&#039;t take it in this direction. Instead, the girl, while not completely thrilled about the arranged marriage decides to give the guy a chance and the 2 actually get along. <br />
<br />
The premise may seem a bit boring because it&#039;s usually that friction between the 2 main characters that add comedy to a series but this comedy is instead introduced by the girls older sister, who seems to have some weird obsession with cute little sisters, and the guys little sister who follows him to his fiances house to help nurture the engaged couples relationship.  <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is nice  and matches the genre quite well, which I guess isn&#039;t surprising from a fairly new series. The characters are attractive and the animations flow naturally without any awkwardness.<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The music in the show is nice and easy on the ears. I also found myself watching the end credit song every time because it wasn&#039;t jut entertaining but it was catchy too. I found the cast of voice actors to be quite appropriate as well. I found the voice for Hakuyas little sister to be exceptionally well done and the voice for Hakuya himself to be fitting for his personality. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
This is a tough one to evaluate, mostly because it&#039;s the characters that make this show good, but it&#039;s the characters that make it bad. What I mean is, Benio (main girls older sister) and Mashiro (Hakuyas little sister) are awesome and add lots of comedy to the show. Benio is a hillarious older sister that is obsessed with doing lots of cute things with her younger sisters (including her now sister-in-law). She&#039;s so obsessed that she ends up being creepy and causes Mashiro to run in horror. The interaction between these two characters is fantastic and keeps you laughing constantly. <br />
<br />
However, the sisters personalities heavily overshadow the 2 main characters. There&#039;s nothing wrong with Kobeni (the main girl), she&#039;s actually pretty likeable and a well rounded character. Unfortunately, Hakuya is one of the worst main characters in the history of rom coms. He is incredibly silent, has almost no personality, is incredibly stupid (his sister does all the thinking for him), and only has a line or 2 per episode. I didn&#039;t have a problem with this at first because characters like that usually go through some character development and become more likeable. Hakuya on the other hand does not. He stays the same throughout the entire season. <br />
<br />
The interactions between him and Kobeni are boring and never lead to any real relationship development. Not only did I find myself feeling sorry for Koberi but I couldn&#039;t really understand how anyone could fall in love with someone like Hakuya. It&#039;s different when you have a mysterious, silent main character that is constantly proving to be reliable but that&#039;s not Hakuya, he&#039;s mysterious sure, but he&#039;s lacking common sense, he&#039;s indecisive, and he&#039;s just not interesting. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
The 2 sisters made this show really funny and stayed pretty consistent in their humor throughout the show. However, the show started to lose momentum around half season and while the comedy was still there, i think it&#039;s because the romance never really picked up momentum. Their romance for the most part stayed pretty neutral throughout the entire season. While I loved the sister comedy, it just wasn&#039;t enough to carry the entire show. About half way through the season, I was used to the comedy and while it was still enjoyable, it just wasn&#039;t as enjoyable as the beginning. This is the point where romance starts to gain momentum and make up for that initial lose of enjoyment. Unfortunately, that didn&#039;t happen in this show and the episodes became a bit stagnant. <br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s not bad for a rom com. It had tons of potential to be a really lovely slice of life rom com but it&#039;s squandered because of a poor male lead. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s bad, I don&#039;t regret watching it but it wasn&#039;t spectacular either. It&#039;s one of those shows that start off really good and just keep gradually losing steam. It never hits that point of being bad but it&#039;s certainly disappointing after having such a promising beginning.

    Overall Enjoyment: 3<br />
<br />
Wow, this is the only anime to be compelling enough for me to even want to write a review, and not in a good way. This anime started off decent enough, and yet it went increasingly downhill from there. I felt zero development in any area of this anime, it didn&#039;t have any hint of depth. I was hoping for a charming rom-com that would be simple to watch and yet satisfying. I was disappointed, to say the least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story and Plot: 4<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t completely uninterested in the plot, but it really dragged on and was weighed down by poor comedy on Benio&#039;s part.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review311290">
        The comedy was decent, but whenever Benio was on screen I dreaded what was to come, I found her comedic role to be astoundingly annoying. As for Hakuya and Mitsumine not being human, I found it surprising that they never show us what they can really do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
The art was actually charming, and it fit the feeling of the show. The art gave off a heartwarming and simplistic vibe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
The worst character got too much screen time, the best characters got too little. Benio is my main complaint, it became blatantly obvious that she had an uncomfortable obsession with lolis. This &#039;quirk&#039; of hers wasn&#039;t funny in the slightest, I felt genuinely uncomfortable with her character, every second she was on screen I was screaming for the FBI. Had she had less screen time, or none at all, this anime would have been ten times more enjoyable. I found Mitsumine to be adorable for being so childishly mature, and Kobeni was also very sweet. As for Hakuya, I found his character to be the most comical. His expressionless emotions were of the few things to actually crack me up, maybe one day he&#039;ll finish his wooden house. However, these characters still felt 2D and flat, and it&#039;s easy to become uninterested in them.<br />

    The story is dumb, half the characters are unbearable, and the scenarios presented throughout the show are mind-numbingly stupid.<br />
<br />
7/10 because I&#039;m a f***ing idiot<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, this show managed to keep me smiling through most of the run time despite its shortcomings in general entertainment competency. The presentation is very &quot;cutesy&quot; which made it hard for me to hate the show as much as I should. The opening and ending songs and animations were also very warm and fun to watch.<br />
<br />
The problems with the story can be forgiven if you just want to turn your brain off, however, the characters cannot and are the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201588">
        main issue here. The problem isn&#039;t even with the dialogue, but more that a lot of the characters in the show are just downright unlikable (Benio and Niko being the two worst). Also, the show&#039;s representation of high school life is so bad that I honestly couldn&#039;t tell if it was attempting to be a parody or if the someone actually thought highschoolers acted like this.

    I wasn&#039;t sure I would like this show, in all honesty. I happened upon it by chance, and with nothing else to do decided to give it a swing. In the end, I couldn&#039;t stop watching it till I had finished every episode, the process of which may have upset my non-anime-loving family members (in short, my whole family). The thing most intriguing about this show is it is not about supernatural abilities and the people who use them,  but rather it is about people with abilities and how they live with them. The story plot is short, but carried out well; at no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142497">
        point was I wondering why a character was in existence, or why they had to do something so illogical. That in its self was a relief because too often in stories there is that one character that seems to have no plot but to make the same mistake repeatedly. <br />
Anyways, of you haven&#039;t watched this show, you should, but if you don&#039;t, you&#039;ll live. <br />
<br />
For Parents: despite being a seinen romance anime, it is really clean. You never see anything and there is surprisingly no fan service or kissing.

    Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, or Engaged to the Unidentified is a Slice of Life, Romance-Comedy anime that was slated in Winter 2014. At a glance, Mikakunin seems to be another generic show out of thousands released by Japan&#039;s animation industry, with your cliché main character living under the same roof with the opposite sex and hilarities ensue. But what the show provided is a decent slice of life with an awkward romance of two species.<br />
<br />
To start, the show&#039;s story is generic, it plays the tired living under the same roof trope that a lot of shows has done. Even its catch, which can be seen in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137171">
        the title, is already played out. But what Mikakunin does is it keeps true to itself, being a simple slice of life show with insight on their characters and how the strange budding romance between the two characters develops. It is not special, but it does not really need to.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, this is where Mikakunin shines. There&#039;s the main character Yonomori Kobeni, a shy, but responsible sixteen year old heroine who is engaged Hakuya Mitsumine, an overly quiet person who is more than what meets the eye. They are supported by Kobeni&#039;s sister, Yonomori Benio, a loving sister who adores Hakuya&#039;s younger sister, Mashiro Mitsumine to an obsessive degree. What the show provided are stereotypical characters, your main character with little depth, its romantic interest that is secretive and cool, an overactive sister and your token loli who is cute and like sweets. It’s oh so familiar, but Mikakunin did great strides in making their dynamics fun, lively and relatable. It placed the main characters in an awkward romance due to how they are engaged, with not much familiarity, and they develop their romance in small yet understandable ways. Kobeni and Hakuya received decent development and showed that a character can outgrow their supposed archetype. But, it is unfortunate that the show&#039;s spotlight is taken by the two supporting characters, due to their outburst of character and their love-hate relationship that is more amusing to see. The show also features decent background characters that made the world&#039;s setting livelier. They are the cogs that set the romance of the main character moving, and it is to the studio&#039;s credit on how they utilised the background characters nicely yet avoided focusing on them too much that it might impede the development on the main cast.<br />
<br />
Moving on to aesthetics, it is clear that the company has budget saved up for the show. The characters are distinct and colourful, where the character differs themselves nicely from one another. There may be too much difference in hairstyle colours, but it is up to the audience on how they look upon it. The environment is nicely drawn, with effects that fill up certain areas in relation to real life. And to Mikakunin&#039;s credit, the animation is great, with different frames used to provide smooth transitions to character movement; it provides a nice bounce to the lively show and provides a quirky zip to its comedic parts.<br />
<br />
Next up is the sound in the show. To be honest, Mikakunin&#039;s soundtrack did not have any that stood out, but what it provided are soundtracks that kept the show from sounding empty. It provided sound effect to every minute detail, making it either funnier, or impactful depending on the scene. The voice acting for each characters are fitting, making sure that the character archetype is there, especially so with Benio and Mashiro where their love-hate relationship requires back and forth commentary against each other. Thus, kudos to the studio from making sure that not only is the aesthetic pleasing, but it is supported by effects that may not be aurally outstanding, but filling nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Lastly, for all the things that Mikakunin provides, it is all for naught if it’s not entertaining. Anime is an entertainment medium, and if a show is not entertaining, then it did not serve its purpose. Entertainment, in my own definition, has a lot of terms, but let&#039;s look at Mikakunin as the show that it wanted to be, a Slice of Life, Romance-Comedy. In the end, Mikakunin is a nice albeit generic slice of life. It was carried by its character dynamics and budget that made the show livelier than what it can be. The romance is there, more of a mutual understanding but not fully developed. The company may not have touch on the Mitsumine&#039;s family backstory that much, but it might be for the better so as to keep the show as what it was, a simple slice of life with a touch of romance.<br />
<br />
To conclude, Mikakunin is a good show, it was not the funniest, nor did it have the loveliest romance there, but it did a solid job on providing some chuckle here and there and some cute awkward romantic development between the characters. A 7/10 show that will garner its audience due to its cuteness, and to think about it, that is not so bad after all.<br />

    So, where can I start with this review, truly one of the best romance comedies in a while due to the fact that our protagonist is not a typical harem boy that restrains his feelings, our man is a true Chad and that pays out beautifully.<br />
<br />
The story is really interesting and you&#039;ll be always at the edge of your seat because this series actually knows how to implement twist, they never feel like it&#039;s there just because and they actually follow up on every detail added very well, we can see the intent of the writers on making this a love story with a lots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346583">
        of cute moments and lots of laughs, truly one of my favorites.<br />
<br />
To be a show that has been out for a long time I feel like the animation is really good and at the time one of the best, sure it is starting to show its age but you will be trapped by the lovely characters, a second season would be what we really need to make this year worth.<br />
<br />
We can see the passion that was put into this project in the ending scene, definitely one I&#039;ll be listening on repeat, whenever the show ends at a climax you automatically start to sing along. The opening is also really good in it&#039;s own way, pretty much where they spent the entire fanservice budget which is not a bad thing considering the kind hearted nature of this show.<br />
<br />
One of the strongest points for this show is the characters, they are all so loveable that it was hard to pick a favorite (you&#039;ll know who is the cutest from the first episode) they actually have common sense and act very mature, a few jokes here and there but they are always welcome.<br />
<br />
Overall I can say this needs a second season and this will be another one I will have to pick the manga up, if you&#039;re into this type of shows you will be in for a treat. I tend to be a bit picky when it comes to this because I love romance and a show that actually accomplishes it&#039;s goal leaves you with a warm sensation in the heart. 10/10 one of my favorites!

    And this series was extremely admirable, but also extremely dubious. However, there are no answers to many of the questions in this series. I wish I could see Kobeni and Hakuya&#039;s past.<br />
But this Benio-Sama and Mashiro made this series funny.<br />
<br />
Story, Characters, Animation, Soundtrack:<br />
Story: The story of sheep is one I have never met before, and I do not know what to compare it with all my evenings watched so far, however in some moments of the story are left many question marks, and we do not give the answer to them. That&#039;s why it has a lower grade here in the story, but still what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399349">
        we see is something new and unheard of so far.<br />
Characters: The characters are extremely well made. Especially older sister Benio, tha oiii is so funny and caring a little too caring if you ask me, but you can&#039;t even get upset with her for how she is. She and Mashiro-tan create this much funnier story. Kobeni-chan is again that girl who is much too worried and insecure about her, that&#039;s why some moments bother me. However, we have Hakuya and he always solves the group&#039;s problems in some way.<br />
Animation: Brother animation is really enjoyable and makes me feel extremely good watching this series. It calms you down extremely, but it also assures you that you will not have extremely sad and extremely unpleasant moments.<br />
Soundtrack: The soundtrack brother is extremely good and is well tuned. At any time and where you need sound is great. That&#039;s why I like these animes so much, because you will always know that there will be nothing to bother you<br />
<br />
Personal Opinion:<br />
My opinion about this anime is that it is much too unpredictable at times, and at others it is too unpredictable, we don&#039;t have much balance here. &quot;But we can&#039;t be upset about that. Still, op and ed are great. I recommend them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Short opinion and note: Masterpiece 10/10
