    Amagami SS+ Plus is the second season to the show Amagami SS. This review will try to cater to any viewer, whether you watched to first season or not. Therefore, there are no spoilers. Also another thing to note, most of this review was formulated before the show finished airing. Because none of my thoughts have changed since the writing of this review to the very end, I added an extra paragraph at the end of my initial review for any thoughts I figured you guys would want to know, rather than rewrite the whole review.<br />
<br />
To recap, let&#039;s briefly jump back to the concept of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55463">
        the first season. Amagami SS was a story of a guy named Tachibana Junichi that got stood up by his date on Christmas Eve two years ago. In the present, Junichi is very melancholy about his love life, but is presented with many ways to get the date he was never able to get. <br />
<br />
Basically, the story, which runs in omnibus format, is about a guy named Junichi, who technically dates six or seven girls leading up to Christmas Eve. However the story itself runs, in the best way I can describe it, as if it has parallel universes. So no, he is not dating multiple girls at the same time... technically. Specifically, the story, which is divided in to 4 episode arcs per girl, highlights the different stories that come with Junichi&#039;s relationships with each of the six girls to hopefully get the Christmas Eve date he was not able to get beforehand. To specify even more, aftereach arc ends, time resets to a time prior to the days leading up to Christmas Eve and another girl gets to be with him.<br />
<br />
Saying all that, Amagami SS+ Plus season/show is run in the same format as the previous but in a 12 episode format - 2 episode arcs for each of the 6 girls (though it seems as if MyAnimeList is not that sure of the episode count). The story, while not necessarily kicking off right where each arc in the first ended, adds on to those stories. That said, because of the unique nature of the show, and because it is a direct sequel, going through the first season is a must to watch SS+ Plus.<br />
<br />
Without spoiling anyone (those who have not entered the whole series series included), I&#039;ll just say that the story is nothing too major, and personally and quite frankly, with the exception of Sakurai Rihoko&#039;s arc and maybe one or two more at best that may show up in the next few weeks (the show is still airing at the moment this review is being made), the story is not anything too mindblowing - I cannot stress this enough in this review. As a whole, because of the unique composition of Amagami SS, the second season sort of suffers in that each arc is only composed of 2 episodes. This is frankly not enough to write up any major developments to add to the stories established in the first season. Actually, to put it simply, these episodes were probably made just for the fans who were literally dying to see more of the show.<br />
<br />
Despite some of downsides I see to the show, I do enjoy it, but I don&#039;t commit to it as much as the richer experiences from other 12 episode shows. You will find some if not most of the happy and romantic qualities that the first season had. In regards to conflicts, they, again, are not as drawn out as well as in the first season, but are a decent watch to say the least. I give the show credit for what its worth.<br />
<br />
As someone who watched the first season and liked it a decent amount, I though SS+ Plus was good at best. It did what I expected it to do - maybe it added a bit more depth to each of the characters here and there, but I honestly did not find it that necessary to watch - again, apart from one or two good arcs. That&#039;s not saying you shouldn&#039;t watch it. It&#039;s just saying don&#039;t expect too much out of it. If you enjoyed and had fun watching Amagami SS, then SS+ Plus will most definitely be a good watch as well. If you have not watched watched the first season, all I can say is that you will feel completely alienated if you watch SS+. While there is some substance for new viewers, it would probably make you think worse of the show, which is not that fair. Take note of that first season before you judge.<br />
<br />
*Update after show&#039;s end: I can honestly say that the show overall was good. However most of my thoughts did not change over the course of the three or four weeks since the making of this review. Additionally, I&#039;d like to add that Haruka&#039;s arc was, although predictable, a really fun and satisfying arc overall, although I&#039;m not sure if I can agree with the show ending with Miya&#039;s mini-arc. If the show ended with Haruka, that would have been much better than dragging along the season longer than it should. If anything, this should have been a DVD/BD extra, not an extension of the season run - but I digress.

    I&#039;ll be writing a review for this because I absolutely fell in love with this series. <br />
<br />
Also, this review will be for both seasons. <br />
<br />
There will probably be spoilers. <br />
<br />
Amagami SS and SS+ Plus is a story about Tachibana, Junichi. A young man who got stood up on a Christmas date, leaving him traumatized and afraid to fall in love. Two years later, he&#039;ll encounter a certain woman. A woman who&#039;ll bring him back up to his feet and learn to love once again.<br />
<br />
Amagami SS is based on a PS2 Dating sim and is viewed in an omnibus format. Basically, there are 4 episodes (For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89349">
        the first season) for each of the 6 heroines and those 4 episodes tell what happens if Junichi goes after a specific girl. <br />
<br />
Amagami SS+ is the second season and it shows the events that took place after each of the first season&#039;s arcs. So I suppose you can say it&#039;s basically an epilogue to the first series.<br />
<br />
The story itself is pretty much cliche. But I can&#039;t really blame anyone. The series is based off a dating sim. A traumatizing event in the past like that has probably been used before in other dating sim/anime. But I do find each of the story arcs to be romantic, cute and sweet (Except for Rihoko&#039;s first season arc. I was quite disappointed they didn&#039;t end up with each other. The second season Rihoko arc makes up for it though) The show is pretty light on the heart and it doesn&#039;t cause much heart-wrenching feels (Which is good in my case &#039;cause I have a weak heart)<br />
<br />
The characters are enjoyable in their own way. They&#039;re pretty unique from each other and each of them has their own charm. Though I have to say Junichi is a tad bit generic. He&#039;s the average high-school student. But as each story develops, he does get a bit unique (Depending on which story arc he&#039;s in) But I like him. He&#039;s childish, supportive, loving, caring, a bit clueless, reckless and he&#039;d go out of his way to make the girl he loves happy. He reminds me of me, sometimes. <br />
<br />
The art is pretty good. Though the quality of the art did drop at certain points like at the start of Nakata, Sae&#039;s arc. The animation is pretty smooth. No complaints there. The sound and the voice acting was also very good. I especially loved Morishima, Haruka and Tachibana, Miya&#039;s voice acting for some reason.<br />
<br />
My favorite heroine will have to be either Sakurai, Rihoko or Tanamachi, Kaoru. Rihoko is bubbly cute and adorable. She&#039;s innocent and honest and has a big appetite. Kaoru is mischievous but also very hardworking. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable anime. Cute romance here and there. Some slight feels, but that makes the romance all the more satisfying. And you&#039;ll enjoy each of the heroines arcs because their own stories are pretty unique from one another. <br />

    &quot;And they lived happily ever after...&quot;<br />
<br />
Often times, many people wonder what happens afterwards. What exactly is &quot;happily ever after&quot;? Amagami SS+, the sequel to the school romance anime, Amagami SS, gives viewers a glimpse of the lives of the six heroines after the conclusion of the first season. Not much has changed in between seasons - artwork, characters, seiyūs and staff all remained more or less the same - so fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this continuation. With that being said, although Plus is a sequel, knowledge of the first season is not necessarily mandatory as the basic premise of the story can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57341">
        be grasped quickly.<br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
Simplicity is almost always a good thing. Having clean art with a good amount of detail is generally well-accepted, especially when it comes to a series like Amagami SS in which the art is not focused on too much. I found the character designs to be very normal and plain, but that isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. The style is something I see very often but that is what makes it easy for my eyes to digest. Backgrounds that are not too fancy which don&#039;t detract my attention from what&#039;s happening is very much positive. AIC did a great job with the animation once again.<br />
<br />
Characters (7/10)<br />
Let&#039;s be honest here, the girls of Amagami SS are far from realistic. Now I may be wrong, but I&#039;m pretty sure there are barely any girls in the world who would want someone like Junichi as their boyfriend. The guy, in many ways, is the reincarnation of a human male&#039;s inner desires; he doesn&#039;t know the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Not only that, but he&#039;s also a blatant pervert and idiotic protagonist. Despite all this, he ends up getting the girl at the end, which is a big reason why I think the characters are unrealistic. Nonetheless, the girls do develop during their own arcs. You can easily see that, after they started dating Junichi, their personalities have changed. While I would&#039;ve preferred Junichi to not have been such an irritable character, I believe his current personality was used on purpose, in order to enable viewers of similar traits to be able to relate to him and to gain hope (i.e. &quot;if someone like Junichi can get a beautiful girlfriend, then so can I!&quot;).<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10)<br />
azusa returns for a second season with two more new songs - an OP and an ED - both of which I liked. They also fit their respective positions very well; the OP was high-energy, readying the viewer for the episode to come while the mellow ED wrapped out the episode nicely. BGM was the same as in the first season. Nothing in particular was memorable but it was there and did its job of enhancing scenes without being too obtrusive. No changes in voice acting since all the characters are still the same. Notable seiyūs include Itō Shizuka (Morishima Haruka, Katsura Hinagiku [Hayate no Gotoku!]), Yukana (Nanasaki Ai, C.C. [Code Geass]), and Satō Rina (Tanamachi Kaoru, Misaka Mikoto [To Aru Kagaku no Railgun]). Unfortunately, there were no insert songs unlike in season one.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10)<br />
The omnibus format follows from the first season into the second. Each girl gets their own two-episode arc that introduces a problem before solving it. The purpose of these problems is to strengthen each of the girls&#039; relationship with Junichi. It&#039;s realistic in a sense because real life relationships always contain ups and downs, even if the couple has just started dating. The different stories evoke a wide variety of emotions and appeal to viewers of diverse preferences. Personally, I thought some of the arcs were too rushed as there were only two episodes available for the problem to be introduced and solved.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10)<br />
As a fan of Amagami SS, I definitely enjoyed Plus. Seeing my favorite Amagami girls in action again was a real treat. I would&#039;ve liked for it to be 24 episodes but, alas, you can&#039;t have everything go your way. At this point, I think it&#039;s safe to say that this is going to be the last of Amagami SS, in terms of TV series. It&#039;s been a good 38 episodes and I&#039;m satisfied with how things went. I would recommend this show to those who want to watch a nice, relaxing shōnen romantic comedy. You won&#039;t be disappointed!

    AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH DAMNIT!!!!!!! ヽ(ｏ`皿′ｏ)ﾉ<br />
Pardon my French. ಠ_ರೃ<br />
This anime series has been sucking me in since the very beginning. I get attached to the different plot arcs and each of the girls. I also find myself having a very hard time when any of the arcs endings.<br />
<br />
Take this for example. In Amagami SS the ending of Sae, Ai, and Haruka were a bit easier to feel &quot;accomplished&quot; or that the story had an end. They each ended with a scene that was pretty definitive that Junichi made a home run. I do not mean for this to sound perverted or that I&#039;m asking for a hentai. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51673">
        just want you to consider how in a rout anime such as this, where each girl has only a fraction of the season for their arcs, need to get you attached and leave you fulfilled within that period. (〜￣▽￣)〜<br />
<br />
With how much fanservice is given, it does not feel right to end on more of the same. You need to end an arc with something that takes their relationship to the next level. In your average anime these endings would be satisfying indeed. However they get to third base rather quickly in almost every arc before the final episode. ಠ_ಠ<br />
<br />
With a second season they are giving two episodes to each heroine to basically put the cherry on top of a wonderful story. Or pop it. Pardon my humor, I simply couldn&#039;t resist after that being the main topic of my review.<br />
<br />
I had much to look forward to, however with Ayatsuji&#039;s arc ending I do not feel satisfied. I did enjoy the episodes very muchly. It is just rather awkward because I feel like I&#039;m getting more of the same. (ノ#-_-)ノ<br />
Again, not a bad thing. (｡｡ヾ)<br />
<br />
FIRST ARC TSUKASA AYATSUJI SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Their romantic peek was<br />
&quot;are you happy with just one kiss?&quot;<br />
&quot;Baka~&quot;<br />
Very hartwarming, but most of this anime is hartwarming. I want to burst with glee and satisfaction that the grand tale has ended. Perhaps burst is not the best way to describe such things to the internet... (╯°Д°）╯︵/(.□ . \)<br />
<br />
I am no professional by any means, but I think there are some small tweaks that could have been done to make a perfect grade.<br />
At the end of the bath scene before the fade-out:<br />
Move the last line before the fade-out! and then<br />
1.) Junichi turn around and hug her<br />
2.) Tsukasa be a bit forceful and push him over<br />
3.) Tsukasa pull one strap of her swimsuit down over her shoulder (I feel like this might be a bit much though)<br />
~fade-out~<br />
<br />
(END OF SPOILER)<br />
<br />
Some of you may think &quot;thats it? All this hoopla for you being butt-hurt wishing for 5 more frames?&quot; It may not seem like much, but just think about it. If those frames were there. Would it change how you feel about the end? Sometimes the smallest changes can have the largest effect. ｡◕‿◕｡<br />
<br />
I know I cant change what we can expect from the rest of this series, I just wanted to give you something to consider for rout animes. So let us hope for the best, and look forward to the rest of the story arcs. ヽ(´▽`)/<br />
Possibly if needed (or if they already plan to) an Amagami SS++ (ﾟДﾟ&quot;)<br />
Though I&#039;m not sure my heart could handle it. (≧∇≦)

    The sequel that was better than the original. <br />
<br />
This is coming from an anime-only POV.<br />
<br />
While season one was good, I found it certainly has weak spots in that several of the character arcs were weak, and that the quality of overall anime was definitely uneven. While I for one, enjoyed the Kaoru/Haruka/Class Rep arcs in season one, I found the others &quot;ok&quot;, or &quot;decent enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
In season 2, they essentially fix this problem. Even for the characters I previously didn&#039;t care about, I found their stories at least moderately engaging. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s feel good &quot;happily ever after&quot; stories that surprisingly, were better than the the original &quot;how&quot;

    Amagami SS+ plus is the second season of the amagami ss series, the prequel revolved around the mc having a go at each girl for some episodes (an arc for each girl) and spending time with them. This season also does the same thing but it continues from where the first season left it off.<br />
<br />
The animation, sound and plot are even better. Still smooth, soft and gentle but also crisp and beautiful, about then openings I still got &quot;Check My Soul, Check My Soul, HAATO ga ugokidashita ,ima  KIMI to issho ni kakedasou&quot; stuck on my head and I absolutely loved that opening. <br />
<br />
Overall

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404663">
        this series is extremely cute and realistic, the characters are great and memorable. The story and plot are sharp and original but the reason I love this series is because no episodes are too sad, you can always go watch amagami ss and roast your heart with the wholesome writing, characters and scenes. Really fun series you gotta watch and the second season was worth no less than the first one. Total 9/10 just because the story is not original enough for a 10.

    As the summary says, Amagami SS+ is the second seaso of Amagai SS.<br />
<br />
From just the first episode alone, it seems as though we will be getting more character dvelopment between each of the 6 protagonist females and the main protagonist male.  However, the story seems like it will take a differant route from the first season&#039;s &quot;getting the girl and their future&quot; to a more &quot;events between getting the girl and their future.  Since we know the series will be only 12 episodes long, it is indicated by the words &quot;first and second -half&quot;  in the title of the first episode and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51141">
        preview that each of the 6 female protagnists will likely be 2 episdes each.<br />
<br />
Since this is a second season, I feel it would be necessary to watch the first season since it seems like they are futher building on the chracters and teir relationships from the first season.<br />
<br />
The first episode was very well done with the typical boyfriend/girl friend interation and ecchi shenanians between them, but there is an added tension thanks to he addition of side charcters.<br />
<br />
The story tus far is good in that it is conistant with the first season story line with a few more plot twists now that the main storyline isnt about trying to get te girl. The art is pretty much the same as the first season, but still great.  The sound in my opinion is better and the op and ed songs are fitting. The charactes are still as entertaining as ever thus making it fairly enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Overall the first espisode really leaves a great impression and makes you want to watch more to see what drama will unfold, thus making it a must see; especially if you were a fan of the first season and and even if you werent you should still give it a shot.

    Here is my first review, so please go easy on me....<br />
<br />
Introduction : when i saw this anime for first time, i know this anime would be awesome, why? since the artwork and how beautiful the girl in it... and i think thats enough reason for me to try watching it.<br />
<br />
STORY : 9/10<br />
Since this anime focussing on love story, i would say this anime present an interesting love story than another love anime. I mean, come on. who doesnt like to see a MC dating into 6 six different girls and see the lovey dovey talks between them? and absolutely i am the one who loves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77555">
        to see MC dating into the girl who bump into him. The main point is the story  in this anime is so unique, you wouldn&#039;t find an anime like this anymore.<br />
<br />
ARTWORK 10/10<br />
Like i said before, this artwork is the reason why i am watching this anime. the artwork for the people or the scenes is absolutely stunning (especially the girls, lol), The characters are drawn good, it was very interesting to see.<br />
<br />
SOUND 10/10<br />
I really love the opening song from Amagami SS plus, its certainly presents the story, and also the voice for the character is also lovely, its just the seiyuu really putting their feelings in the actor, oh, the background music is also really fit with the anime.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 10/10<br />
The character of this anime is the first one i caught. the six different girls with different characters and also the main character guy who is have the same feeling with the real man (like have a naughty thinking), The interesting point is which the feelings that the MC has is like the other us. We, man, always have a dirty thinking if we&#039;re alone with the girl. <br />
<br />
OVERALL 10/10<br />
I really recommend to all people who loves to see a light love story,without any complex story to see this anime. you didnt have to think too much when you see this anime. you just need to enjoy the show and said &quot;Wow, Thats very lovely&quot;<br />

    Ah, nothing like a good victory lap.<br />
<br />
The music for Amagami SS+ Plus (is that said Amagami SS plus plus?) was pretty much the same quality as the first season. Alright.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a nice mini-story for each of the girls, which serve to more fully flesh out their relationships with Junichi. Honestly, these episodes should have been stuffed into the first season to make things feel more complete. If I could go to my past self, I&#039;d tell him to watch the 4-episodes arcs of Season 1 and then the 2-episode arcs of Season 2 for each girl together. Seriously. Try it out.<br />
<br />
The art still has me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241162">
        going &quot;meh.&quot; The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh. Same as the first season.<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty much the same as the first season, but it&#039;s nice to see how they get along with Junichi after the fact.<br />
<br />
Overall, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the first one. If you really liked Season 1 of Amagami SS, you&#039;ll love this season. If you didn&#039;t, Season 2 might redeem it for you, but probably not. If Season 1 was Oreos, Season 2 would be the milk. A typical vanilla cake of an anime with cute sprinkles on top gives Amagami SS+ Plus a final score of 7.

    The users before me have provided very thorough reviews on this anime series, but I believe there is one area that could use some enlightening. Having watched the first season and enjoying it completely, I found this one lacking somewhat in character progression.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll try not to write too much of a spoiler here. Each included story, as has been said, details the afterevents some months further along, of the main protagonist&#039;s (Tachibana Junichi) choices in selecting each of the first series&#039; heroines. While I found nothing particularly thrilling or disappointing in the stories themselves, I thought it rather confusing that, after being in a close

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62961">
        (very, in some cases) relationship with most of the girls for an extended period of time, why they (mostly Junichi) still behave as if they barely know each other? The awkwardness, shyness, nervousness, and general elements of inhibition were typical and expected in the first series, as Junichi got to know each of the girls, but why are these feelings replayed almost exactly the same way again? This is particularly evident with Junichi; in this respect, I found his behavior almost unbelievable, and definitely unrealistic. Perhaps with only two episodes per character, there&#039;s just not enough explanation.<br />
<br />
That being said, I really did like the way that some of the visual novel endings based upon the first series, that did not appear in the anime of said series, found their way into this anime series. With both animes watched a few times, my ideas about the best girl for Junichi haven&#039;t changed: Kaoru.

Disclaimer<br />

The following review is mostly spoiler-free (except for two marked locations), and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!<br />
<br />
Additionally, due to this being the second season of Amagami SS, it should go without saying that you need to watch season 1 of the show before even considering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249952">
        or understanding this review. My review is based off of my first season review, therefore it would be good to check that out if you want full critiques of the show as a whole.<br />

---------<br />
Positives<br />
---------<br />
- More Daisuki<br />
Did you love Amagami SS? Then Amagami SS+ Plus is a no brainer. It extends the stories of each of the characters for 2 additional episodes each, providing a small conflict + resolution to deepen the relationships depicted in the first season. I consider this less of an independent &quot;season&quot;, but rather a continuation, addition, or extended epilogue to the series as a whole. Call it a &quot;love letter&quot; from the creators of the show to its fans. In any case, it&#039;s very welcome from me!<br />
<br />
- Added Screen Time<br />
One of the common complaints about Amagami SS was its relatively short arcs (4 episodes), which initially seems like Amagami SS+ Plus just exacerbates. But instead of being separate instances, the combination of both seasons (ending up with ~6 episodes on each character) helps those doubts melt away, satisfying many small quibbles about the characters of the first season. We get to see more depth to all the characters and their relationship to Junichi, which only serves to make you fall in love with the couplings all over again!<br />
<br />
- Excellent Finale<br />
One of the key strengths of Amagami SS was its ability to flesh out characters even when not in their own respective arcs. While the final (non-arc) episode is heavy on the fan-service due to its setting, it fulfills my final desire to see many of the main cast interact with each other in new and exciting ways. Move aside Junichi, I want a show with just the girls!<br />

- Rihoko&#039;s Arc<br />
The first season&#039;s Rihoko arc was a complete tease, and many felt unsatisfied with its ending. I will not give away the ending of Rihoko&#039;s continuation this season, but it was handled a lot more satisfyingly this season and rounded out into an excellent 6-episode arc. This was the story that the arc was originally meant to be, and I&#039;m happy we could all see it through.<br />

- MC Fatigue Pt. 2<br />
Junichi Tachibana is approximately EXACTLY the same as the first season. As such, there are many positives and negatives to his character, which balance out into a frustrating, but ultimately lovable MC. Some arcs had him be a little less facepalm worthy than others, but don&#039;t expect him to suddenly change things up from the first season! Haha.<br />

- Kaoru&#039;s Arc<br />
This is personal preference, but in my opinion Kaoru&#039;s mini arc this season was a huge disappointment. After an incredibly strong showing in Season 1 (tied for 2nd best), her character felt incredibly confused and inconsistent. The first seasons presented a very positive tsundere image, with self denial but ultimately a submission to her feelings. This season felt like she slipped into every single bad tsundere characteristic. On top of that, she had a very legitimate issue to grapple with (how do you effectively transition from being close friends to lovers), which never actually got resolved! They fought a bunch, made up, and suddenly it&#039;s like: &quot;Oh that problem&#039;s magically solved too!&quot;. Whaaat?! Sorry Kaoru, I love your character but with such a strong cast of characters, this will affect your standing greatly in my mind. Don&#039;t worry though, we always have Season 1 re-watches ;~;<br />

Conclusion<br />
----------<br />
Amagami SS+ Plus, besides having a classically silly anime name, is more of the same. It continues to flesh out the roles the characters play, and satisfies fans&#039; desires to see more of their favourite characters and relationship dynamics. If you enjoyed the first season, there&#039;s no reason why you wouldn&#039;t love the second season just as much. It has all of the elements I loved, and the quibbles that nagged at me, all wrapped up in a nice little series of epilogues. Some stories got better, some series got a little bit less good, but most of them stayed consistently fantastic. Even the arcs I &quot;liked the least&quot; are solid 8s or 9s, which should tell you about the absurd quality of the girls in this show. I&#039;m tremendously sad that this is the end of my Amagami SS journey, but so happy I got to experience it along the way!<br />

Final Rating<br />
------------<br />
While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: &quot;Would you recommend I watch this show?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Due to the sequel nature of this review, plus the fact that this season is more of an &quot;epilogue&quot; rather than its own independent thing, I recommend that anyone who has watched Season 1 must watch Season 2, as it is essential to the overall Amagami SS experience!<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watched Amagami SS (the first season), go read my review and give it a shot! Hopefully I&#039;ll see you back here after you&#039;ve binged both seasons ;)

    It&#039;s very surprising to me,when I read the information at MAL that the second season of Amagami SS was planned back then.I mean,well...the story still can be developed remembering the previous season leave us when Tachibana Junichi still at 2nd grade,but it really is still surprising.Why?Cause this anime&#039;s storyline goes in a same situation,setting,and time but it kept repeated with the same male character with six different heroine and in several heroine,we can watch a glimpse of their future after the male character conquered their heart.So,will it be wright to make a sequel of it,despite we already watch their future self?The answer is YES.It fulfill

          <span style="display: none;" id="review59683">
        my high expectation.To be honest,the word sequel itself is a bit worry me.We can see many anime quality drop instantly after their sequel was aired and it&#039;s often that the previous season quality was much better than the next.Amagami SS first season itself,for me,was quite impressive.Well,it&#039;s a bit like playing an automatic visual novel,but it still good.Six girl with a unique and different character from each other,yeah that&#039;s what made this show interesting.<br />
<br />
So,basically Amagami SS+ is the continuation of the story from the first season.The times set<br />
a several month after Tachibana Junichi confess his love to each heroine.I&#039;m a bit confused<br />
about how to make this review since I&#039;m usually make a review mainly based on the plot.<br />
But,this one is exceptional cause it has six different plot.So I will review it from the each heroine<br />
character and their development after the previous season.About Tachibana?Well just ignore<br />
him.His stil as pervert,dull,stupid,and useless as usual.Oh god,what kind of Lady Luck that<br />
possessed this extremely lucky dude?All he&#039;s thinking about is how to get a quick and nice<br />
sex with all of the heroine.And what makes me despise him even more,all of the heroine almost<br />
always agree to his stupid pervy request from time to time like,&quot;May I sleep on your belly?&quot;,<br />
&quot;Can I kiss your knee?(in season one)&quot;.What the hell,fuck!Girls,please don&#039;t be a slut.<br />
If they gonna make the third season of Amagami SS,I&#039;m personally request his death.<br />
<br />
Almost all of the action and the development of their relationship come from the heroine.It looks<br />
like they encouraging Tachibana to take a deeper action cause he&#039;s way too dull to be a boyfriend.In this 2nd season the amount of the episode has been reduced to only 13 episode.So each arc have two episode and one addition for a filler in the last episode.Not much different from the previous season actually,eventhough it has a shorter episode,but I do like this one better.The heroines are way more attractive and responsive than in the first season.It make them a lot more appealing.Maybe it&#039;s because they already in a phase where they&#039;ve become a lover so they can talk about their feelings more seriously and honestly than before they date each other.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s continue to the heroines character.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit change in the second season.The arc got a reverse in their turn to appear at<br />
the show.So,Tsukasa is the first one and Haruka is the last one.<br />
<br />
Ayatsuji Tsukasa Arc:<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t judge the book by its cover.I bet you know this phrase already.It suit Tsukasa extremely<br />
well.On her outer appearance you can see her as a respectable person,nice,perfect,and a hardworker.But after you succeeded to penetrate her heart,you will get a shocking turn around in her attitude.She&#039;s a dominant and an oppressor.There&#039;s not even a single guy in the world want to be dominated by their girl so badly.And what makes it worse,she elected to become the student council president which make her bossy attitude become worse.She express her love to Tachibana with her cynical behavior.To be honest,I do like her figure.Long black silky  hair,a pair of gorgeous black eye filled with spirit,slim body,and a pretty nice breast eventhough it&#039;s not too damn big.<br />
<br />
I guess what make this anime rated under 8 point is because of her.She make this show drop<br />
in its content.Want to know why?Here&#039;s my three reason:First,she&#039;s way too dominant.Second,<br />
she&#039;s a hot girl but she&#039;s not cute.Three,her arc is boring.I feel like a de ja vu when I<br />
watch her arc.Not particularly too different from the first season so it&#039;s kinda plain.<br />
She got a job and position and Tachibana help her with her job,they got into an obstacle,<br />
they quell it and voila,the ending kiss!I will give this arc approximately a 3 or 4 for the<br />
overall point.Tsukasa did NOT satisfy me.<br />
<br />
Sakurai Rihoko Arc:<br />
<br />
Hmm,what will I say about Rihoko.Everytime I look in her eyes I always remember about my dog.Suppose she&#039;s not a glutton and have a very strict diet to lose her weight,maybe I will lost<br />
my interest to her.Her chubbyness is so sexy and it&#039;s so appealing.Forget about her breast<br />
for a moment and you will find an innocent,pure,and cute 10 years old girl.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say that her arc is good but it&#039;s not bad either.It&#039;s fine.In her arc,you will watch<br />
her act very unadorned and hesitating about how she will deliver her feeling toward Tachibana.<br />
The ending is too simple and meh meh meh.So I will give it a 6.<br />
<br />
Nanasaki Ai Arc:<br />
<br />
If you ask me about which heroine love Tachibana the most,I will say it&#039;s Ai.If I were looking<br />
for a girlfriend,I&#039;m definitely will searching for someone with her character.Well,isn&#039;t it obvious<br />
that she will give Tachibana a lot of love??Her name itself is Ai (love).A sporty girl,with<br />
a tomboyish appearance.But don&#039;t be deceived,she&#039;s very soft and fragile inside.She&#039;s the opposite from Tsukasa.The only thing that bother me about her is why did the creator made her to be the one with the flattest breast?The other heroine seems pretty stuffed,especially Rihoko,Haruka,and Sae.Kaoru and Tsukasa is a mediocre.And Ai is the most pitiful in the boob ratio contest.<br />
<br />
In her arc in Amagami SS+,Ai and Tachibana couldn&#039;t meet each other too much cause Tachibana in a busy term to prepare for college.She feels very lonely when Tachibana is not in her side.Oh poor Ai.Eventhough she looks very sad and crying,she&#039;s still look pretty and try <br />
to face it rigidly.I like her faithfullness for Tachibana in this arc,so I will give it 8.<br />
<br />
Tanamachi Kaoru Arc:<br />
<br />
I love it!Probably the girl that I like the most,wrapped with the nicest story.Did you realize<br />
that Kaoru is the only arc where its setting is off from the school?That&#039;s what make this<br />
arc the greatest.It is an anime with a school as a main setting but it&#039;s not a rule to make<br />
the story always take place in the school right?Kaoru&#039;s arc definitely gives a refreshing air<br />
to me.The story feels like going very natural and smooth.It gives you something new.<br />
<br />
Well,shortly the couple decide to take a vacation together in order to develop their relationship<br />
toward something more serious.Because they short in money,finally they decided to take<br />
a cheap and fun night touring in a bus.Then,funny and complex thing started one after another.Face it with a love power guys,and you will get a well deserved ending.<br />
<br />
Two things that I love from Kaoru: First,she&#039;s very energetic and sometimes a bit bold and<br />
daring.I like this side of Kaoru.There&#039;s not much girl out there like her in this era.<br />
She can live the situation up anytime,anywhere with her action.Second,she&#039;s a talkative girl.<br />
I like talkative chick cause they can talk their heart content honestly and they can be<br />
so pure and it&#039;s nice to share our mind with a girl like Kaoru.This is the funkiest arc.She&#039;s cute,her attitude is great,her hair is sexy,so I will give Kaoru 10.<br />
<br />
Nakata Sae Arc:<br />
<br />
This heroine.....an angel I guess.Always positive and always looks adorable and super cute.<br />
Not to mention her bust super size.I will like her if she&#039;s act a bit more of her age.<br />
Seriously,she really like a kid.Her gesture,her voice,her hair,and her way to talk.Way too<br />
cute for a highschool student.But that doesn&#039;t matter anymore.Her arc is one of the best.<br />
<br />
In this Arc,Nakata Sae will be tested to be a leader.She will handle the founder festival<br />
committee.Well,she indeed showing a progress from the previous season.She doesn&#039;t see<br />
the cafeteria lady as a vending machine anymore (lol,I wonder why it have to be a vending <br />
machine?).But realizing her lack of social interaction in her community,Miya,her best friend,<br />
whom also Tachibana&#039;s little sister,decided to vote her to become the leader of the founder<br />
festival community.It sure not an easy problem.Her maturity and sense of responsibility really<br />
is developing very well in this arc.We can see from her dedication,she really into this and don&#039;t<br />
wanna let everyone down.Tachibana was really useless in this arc.He wasn&#039;t help Sae at all.<br />
For me,he even adding another trouble for Sae.Yeah,he did something unnecessary as the narrator said.I won&#039;t say what cause I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll spoil it.Watch the show and you will know that I didn&#039;t say anything wrong about Tachibana being so damn useless.<br />
<br />
Aside from Tachibana&#039;s foolishness,this arc is good.But actually,I want more of her breast<br />
exposure.I will give it 8.<br />
<br />
Morishima Haruka Arc:<br />
<br />
The hottest girl among the heroine.Ohh,she really is sexy.Look at her beautiful black hair.<br />
It&#039;s very smooth and a bit wavy touch on the tip of it makes it even better.Really an ojou-sama<br />
type of girl.And her bright blue color of her eyes make her always looks energetic.A british-<br />
japanese mix.What a nice combination wasn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
I think that the probability of a guy like Tachibana dating a girl like Haruka in the real<br />
world is about 0,00000001%,except if you are lucky enough to bump her in front of your class<br />
and &quot;accidentally&quot; groping her breast and triggering a flag with her like in a generic<br />
romance anime :p.To be honest,I like this arc second best to Kaoru&#039;s.The reason is:<br />
<br />
1.Haruka didn&#039;t exaggerate and too aggressive in expressing her love to Tachibana.She act<br />
more of her age and show a calm love plus maturity in facing Tachibana.<br />
<br />
2.There is an appearance of girl who claim to be Haruka&#039;s relative from England.She really<br />
looks like Haruka except for her eyes and hair color.It&#039;s a british mode of Haruka.That&#039;s<br />
double kawai,made me enjoy the arc even more.Her Japanese-British accent really cute.<br />
<br />
3.Finally,Tachibana got his ball as a man.You will see why at the end of the arc.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a great arc,so I will give it 9.<br />
<br />
Overall for Amagami SS+ it&#039;s 9 for me.Well,it&#039;s not actually far better than the first season.<br />
In fact,you will get a pretty much the same feeling from watching it.I don&#039;t even know why I<br />
give it a 9 :p.But if you are looking for a nicer and clearer ending in each of the arc,this is it for you! <br />

    SS Amgami +Plus is the second season to SS Amagami( My favorite anime). SS Amagami Plus takes place right after the first season. We get more character development between the Junichi and the 6 Main girls in this season than last season. We are introduced to the supporting characters that we didn&#039;t see in the last season here. The are trying to interfere with their Junichi&#039;s relationship with said Main girl of the eps. Cannot wait to see more episodes : )

    Yup. I love this series that much.<br />
<br />
Amagami SS+ is the second season of Amagami SS.<br />
<br />
To put it bluntly it gives you more time with your favourite characters. It serves to show what happens with certain girls after the relationship is established as well as to actually establish the relationship with the one that got left out. <br />
<br />
The music was excellent as always.<br />
<br />
The characters were perfect and believable.<br />
<br />
All in all this is the standard which all dramatic slice of lifers should be measured against. <br />
<br />
I cannot honestly say more about it. <br />
<br />
If you enjoyed Amagami SS then you&#039;ll love this one.<br />
<br />
Simple as that and I love

    Amagami SS + Plus further raised the level of its premise. The plot continues the same but with a continuation that surpasses its predecessor Each part of a heroine speaks of the relationship of a boy with a different girl, type a universe for each type of relation of the protagonist with a heroine. This is cool because this anime does not deal with treason much less than harem. This is a girl with a certain personality to make a pair with him. It still remains as an anime with a light storyline, good moments of laughter and striking endings for each heroine, and may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286402">
        be better than others.<br />
<br />
Those who watch will be able to select their best story and their best plot for themselves, without needing to get into controversial issues of who is the best.<br />
<br />

Amagami SS + Plus elevou ainda mais o nível de sua premissa. O enredo continua o mesmo porém com uma continuação que supera o seu antecessor Cada parte de uma heroína fala da relação de um rapaz com uma garota diferente, tipo um universo para cada tipo de relação do protagonista com uma heroína. Isso é bacana pois este anime não trata de traição muito menos de harém. Trata-se de uma garota com uma determinada personalidade para fazer um par com ele. Ainda se mantém como um anime com um enredo leve, bons momentos de risos e finais marcantes para cada heroína, podendo ser uns melhores que outros.<br />
<br />
Quem assistir vai poder selecionar a sua melhor história e o seu melhor enredo para si, sem precisar entrar em questões polêmicas de quem é a melhor.<br />

    I agree with both of the review above although the new season of Amagami ss is still as good as the original, but I just finished watching the first episode of Karou&#039;s arc and it does seem to feel a bit rushed to me considering they are trying to do so much in only 2 episodes. It would have been better if they had done 4 eps per arc again as they did originally as i feel they would have been able to tell more like they did in the original and like i said to me it feels a bit rushed. <br />
<br />
Also it would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54061">
        have been nicer if it was longer and should more of a development in there relationships, because from what i have seen so far even though something like 6 months or so has past, they still seem like they just recently got together.<br />
<br />
It would have been interesting to see there relationships development after the first season as was said was about getting the girl.<br />
<br />
Although I&#039;m saying i wished it was longer and that they put more into the story it is still very good and would recommend watching this and the first season. I can only hope that they make a third season that is more like the first and that this is just a in betweener for that season were they can show them getting further in there relationship and maybe getting past difficult obstacles or something like that.<br />
<br />
Well here&#039;s hoping. :)

    It&#039;s pretty rare that we get to se what happens after he has confessed to the girl (or girls). I was very excited for this, because I&#039;m always so curious to find to know what happens after the boy and the girl have become a couple.<br />
There are still many stories to tell what happens next, and I&#039;m happy that AIC figured that out with Amagami.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story centers around a High School boy who falls in love in 6 different girls.<br />
Do I see some question marks over your heads?<br />
Your maybe asking yourself; How could he possibly fall in love with 6 different girls! AIC have found

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53673">
        a very clever way doing this.<br />
They just do the same they do in eroge games. Make so that the main character can take different routs, so that he ends up with different girls.<br />
This in my mind is a very clever solution!<br />
Always when I watch romance anime it always ends with the girl I like the least ends up with the guy, and the girl I like most ends up heart broken.<br />
Call it the Pera curse.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
It&#039;s very rare that I don&#039;t dislike any of the characters when I&#039;m either watching anime or a live series.<br />
But the characters here are very well written and modelled. And it&#039;s hard not to like all the characters here (either if it&#039;s a supporting character or main).<br />
Something I finded very fun watching is the different ways the main protagonist  changed through each route, and you get to see different sides of the main protagonist.<br />
<br />
Final Impression:<br />
I&#039;m very glad that AIC decided to bring Amagami back. It&#039;s really fun watching the continution of each of the characters.<br />
And after just 6 episodes it is very satisfying to watch how close they have become after the confession. And it always brings a smile to my face to watch

    The first episode completely shocked me, i just couldn&#039;t seem to understand as of why the second season would continue like that, however after watching episode 2 (which was released today) i start to get the main puzzle. The first option that i first thought of was, oh they are going to continue the second season with the last arc (they showed how he would be, in like 10/15 years with the girl so i thought that the second season would follow from after the Founders festival up to that point) however it seems that the second season will be running 2 episodes for each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51687">
        arc (2x6 = 12 episodes) of the first season. <br />
<br />
Basically 2 more episodes to each arc that had been shown in season 1. <br />
I&#039;m looking forward to the next arc!

     After I just finished the first season of Amagami SS, I noticed there was a second season that is ongoing right now. I was really Happy and felt lucky at them same time to see the season season of it. Normally after a confession of a Character and a Kiss was meaning the anime was coming to an end, but i was wrong. The fun keeps on coming.<br />
<br />
 Amagami SS+ plus continues the love story of each of the 6 main girls with a boy named Junichi. After watching 8 episodes of it, this anime has been sucking me in for the passed weeks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54847">
        with interest on whats going to happen with each girl and how their love story is going to end like.<br />
<br />
  The Characters so far are REALLY great, they are easily showing their feelings and what their means to love Junichi in each ARC. Not to mention the art and voices of each Character, don&#039;t forget how cute the girls are. To me its really hard to dislike any of the main girls, they are just too GREAT! (x<br />
<br />
  So far the anime is going GREAT in a way. I always find myself every Friday night staring at the computer waiting for the video to load with ice cream on my hands. If you intend to watch this anime, you sure need to watch the First season to get a clue where their relationship is going for each ARC. <br />

Teehee.<br />

    A great expansion to the already very well done first season, amagami SS+ takes two more episodes for each character and expands on what happens in their relationship in the year following the first season.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t expecting a second season that was quite as good as the original, but I was very surprised. Amagami SS+ has everything the first season had going for it, on a more compact scale. It is just as good in terms of art and sound, but due to the mere length story is a bit less deep. It still comes very close to being just as great as the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57347">
        season, which makes it a worthy second season in my books.<br />
<br />
Story- 8/10 -Once again adopting the GREAT idea of an omnibus format(in harem animes, where the guy has arcs in which it treats it as if he chose a different girl, so every girl has their special romantic scenes), Amagami SS+ keeps that great romantic harem anime feel going. A standout in most recent harem series, anything within the Amagami series is is a must watch for harem anime fans looking for something recent. Amagami is not really a life changer, like some epic animes are, but it really does well at what it is-a realistic story of romance, in which the guy DOES NOT have that stupid stereotype of harem leads that DONT WANT the girls. He wants what any man would want, and often makes deals with the girls like &quot;I will do this if you kiss me.&quot; That&#039;s a breath of fresh air, because as a guy myself I know I wouldn&#039;t shun sexuality like 90% of harem leads stereotypically do. Each story for each girl has its own romantic style, and every couple of episodes you get something different, which makes for a very interesting experience.<br />
<br />
Art - 9/10 - In terms of harem anime, this one is up there. It isn&#039;t quite as masterful as the works of Key, but it definitely has a high level of animation. Girls are natural in appearance, most are quite imperfect even. Hair colors are realistic (although I have no problem with exotic coloring), and this makes for a lifelike anime that has very down to earth appearances, giving a feeling of &quot;this really is a type of romance that could happen in real life, awww&quot;. Amagami SS+ tends to have very realistic movements and reactions of the female characters, such that based on their personality, what they do with their face and actions while talking suits it. This is an underappreciated trait many animes don&#039;t have, and you can see this trait is in SS+ right away just by watching the opening animation, and seeing how they introduce each girl visually. Each one doesnt even speak a word and you can sense how they act and what their personality is just by their posture, movement, or grace. Good stuff.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10 - In my opinion, the music took a slight dip in quality since the first season. The OP and ED are nonetheless fitting, but they aren&#039;t something I would download and keep in my library. As well, they did not have a separate ending for each character in the anime during each of the arcs. This is something I really liked about the first season, and it is understandable to not want to make a new ending theme every 2 episodes for this season. Still, in comparison to the first season, the music within SS+ is a little bit lacking because of this, but it still is fitting, which is the most important part of sound. Character voices are supremely fitting. They sound like they should, and articulate as they should. The main character&#039;s sister has such a fitting voice, it pretty much blows my mind. They also have their own &quot;tendencies&quot;, which makes them all the more realistic. For example, Miya (the main char&#039;s sister), has this tendency to laugh in an odd way, sounding like &quot;Ni-shi-shi&quot;. This gives characters an identity that can differentiate them from many other animes just by hearing them, without visuals. Having something like that is rare, and awesome. I know most characters would be confusing to guess if I only heard their voice, but many Amagami voice actors would be recognizable just because the characters have such unique voicing methods.<br />
<br />
Characters - 10/10 -  This is the very best part of Amagami, for season 1, and season 2, the characters have been the complete drive for me to watch it. They have such realistic personalities, that I don&#039;t think I have seen any harem anime with more lifelike female characters within it. If you are a guy, just think of a crush you had in real life, and more than likely, someone within SS+ will be so much like that girl that you will wonder how they came up with each so well. <br />
<br />
A personality example would be: girl who is fairly normal in appearance and constantly worried about her weight, is also a childhood friend (honestly, you would NEVER see such a realistic thing as to worry about weight or be imperfect in most animes. She has larger hips than 90% of harem leads, but nonetheless she models a beautiful character based on personality that people are surprised to find themselves lusting after even though she is not a complete bishoujo.) <br />
<br />
Another example would be a student council leader who seems like the standard perfect, sort of strict, and formal girl, at first appearing like the stereotypical Inchou that the main character ignores in most harem animes. As the guy gets to know her, he finds that the girl is very particular and on the inside has a fierce sense of independance. She is in search of love, but does not want that person she falls in love with to think of anyone but her. She has a fiery personality, and this is extremely surprising but somehow seems like it was the way class reps should have been like in every harem anime. Whereas most relationships in harem anime are on a &quot;say something sexual, get embarrassed&quot; level, the relationship the guy has with this character is on a more serious level, such that she sometimes says sexual things without even a blush, and the guy might ask her about something sexual and she won&#039;t even be phased. This is something you typically don&#039;t see at all in this genre. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10 - Despite continuing the story from first season, the short 2 episode arcs will often leave you wanting more. Each arc ends in a pretty fitting way, but even so I found that I wish there could have been a bit more fleshing out of the arc. This is what happens with a shorter set of episodes than the first season, but despite knowing I can&#039;t have everything, this will not stop me from wanting it. In comparison to the first season, my enjoyment of the second has been a bit lower, but not by a huge amount. It&#039;s still a great show.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10 - Not a complete legend within harem anime, but undoubtedly a defining series in the genre. Never before have characters been modeled in such a real way. It is worth watching just to see the realism of the personalities each character has. After seeing the first season, there is absolutely no reason to ignore the second, as it provides just about everything good in the first, on a smaller scale, while continuing the story.
