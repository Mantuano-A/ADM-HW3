    *This review covers all 6 movies, but still mainly focuses on the 6th*<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of &quot;movies&quot; these are not movies. Originally Toie was supposed to create a new 2-cour long Digimon series, but decided to change this midway and release them in an another format. What this format was officially called was &quot;movies&quot;, but this isn&#039;t true. They are &quot;instalments&quot;. Releasing around 4 episodes worth of content at a time in 6 different instalments. <br />
<br />
In the beginning, this idea was seen as a pro, but folks also acknowledged it could backfire. Similar anime releases had been done in the past with great success and insane production

        values. These titles include Kara no Kyoukai, Hellsing Ultimate, Kizumonogatari trilogy, and even Gundam Origin which btw ended at the same day as this Digimon series. The extra cash flow coming from separate ticket sales was enough to fund the production. I am not sure exactly what happened behind the scenes with Digimon. Whether Toie didn&#039;t sell enough or did they just do a quick cash grab without putting any shekels back into the production I do not know. What I do know is that Digimon flopped and it flopped hard.<br />
<br />
These instalments have been going for worse since the first two which were still good and promising. This time around we don&#039;t even have an animation anymore. The series is filled with completely still pictures or alternatively still pictures where one person&#039;s mouth moves when they talk while others are frozen on the screen. The story has stopped moving now too. This is basically how it went. These numbers represent the &quot;movies&quot;:<br />
<br />
1) This series is definitely about Digimons. 2) This series is definitely about the characters. 3) This series is about relationships. 4) This series is about politics. 5) This series is about our main characters sitting in a circle talking about problems that don&#039;t exist. 6) This series is about feelings. --The whole structure of this series is a mess. It&#039;s completely lost and has no idea what it even wants to be. <br />
<br />
Digimons go berserk and are apparently more powerful than anyone else now because they feel emotions. Great. The writing constantly relies on asspulls. And obviously nothing beats the power of friendship, so lets not even try to make our fights believable. Of course, even the powerups are asspulls. It&#039;s embarrassing to even refer this series as &quot;Digimon&quot; and compare it to the greatness that Digimon Tamers -with its philosophies- was. Not that this series didn&#039;t contain any philosophy. We have that one guy who went insane and yelled out some cheesy 2deep5anyone quotes they probably found from google&#039;s first search result for &quot;brainy depressing&quot; . At this point, I wish they had put all this money into World Trigger sequel movie. At least that one wouldn&#039;t have stained the reputation of an already existng franchise. <br />
<br />
The story is practically filler in the 6th one. Collection of random clips, super extended alarm clock scene that just keeps on making noise while there is absolutely no animation even present. Just camera rolling from other still background image to another. Characters standing against completely white Evangelion scenery, the only thing separating this from a .jpeg sketch is the voice acting and video format. Everyone&#039;s favorite shipping pairs hinting canon. And of course an ending sponsored by Marvel Cinematic Universe. Amazing. None of this is what I want from my anime. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack consists of old Digimon songs and also elevator music. They are just remixed and sound like they had a content on Youtube who can remix them the best. I am pretty sure about half of people who have ever used an audio editing program could have done the same job. The voice acting on the other hand was cool especially from the Digimon&#039;s part. Excluding Tentomon. Is the guy eating bread while speaking or does he not have a tongue? Rest of the cast are honestly too good for this show. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t have any bigger problems with the characters outside the unnecessary cryings, but they are nowhere near strong enough to carry this otherwise terrible show. When it comes to enjoyment, this is where I can agree releasing these 4 episodes at a time over the years was a good idea. Marathoning all of this at once would have definitely made it seem even worse of an experience than what it was now.

    *This is a review of the whole series, not just the 6th movie. Also: This review contains spoilers.*<br />
<br />
I&#039;m almost positive a lot of people only watched Digimon Adventure Tri due to it being a sequel to the highly popular and well received Digimon Adventure. Same old characters, same old Digimon ... no fan would want to miss that. Naturally, expectations were high.<br />
<br />
To be fair, one could have had low expectations and still be disappointed. That&#039;s how bad the whole series is. It lacks structural integrity, thrill and character depth, it&#039;s inconsistently paced and even the animation quality is below average.<br />
<br />
Now the premise of the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279782">
        isn&#039;t that bad to begin with. Digimon are infected by a virus which causes them to violently attack other Digimon and even humans. So far, you can at least feel some sort of danger luring the dark, waiting to be discovered. <br />
<br />
The second movie focuses on our characters and tries to give them a bit of backstory and personality, which could have been important for the course of the story. However, in the third movie, the story suddenly blows up. Buzzwords like &quot;Homeostasis&quot; and &quot;Reboot&quot; fly in. What was once a mission to stop the infection of Digimon is now a mission to stop the digital world from being rewritten, which would cause all Digimon to lose their memories. The digital world is still rebooted at the end of movie. In the fourth movie we learn that the big bad guy behind everything is Yggdrasil, a god-like being that wants to create a new world where Digimon and humans cannot interact anymore. Also Gennai has somehow been manipulated by Yggrasil to be evil. What we were told in third movie (that Digimon lose their memories after a reboot) also seems to have exceptions, as Meicoomon has mysteriously retained her memories. In the fifth movie the digital world suddenly begins to destroy the real world. In the last movie, the apocalypse has set in and our DigiDestined are trying their best to fight Ordinemon, an entity that could have originated from Neon Genesis Evangelion. They are losing badly, but of course, with the power of friendship, even the mightiest foe poses no threat. So the story ends with Meicomoon being finally put to rest and suddenly all problems are gone.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t exactly &quot;bad&quot;, but they are only average, one-dimensional and they all have seen more development in Digimon Adventure. Meiko is just poorly written. Her contribution to the overall plot is about 0. I&#039;m not a hater because she wasn&#039;t part of the original 8 DigiDestined, but it&#039;s hard to accept her because she&#039;s a shallow character that is of nearly no relevance at all.<br />
On the enemies&#039; part, things look a bit different. They are almost all lacking motives, something that I feel is absolutely necessary for a good show. As a viewer, I should be able to comprehend the heroes as much as the enemies. Sadly, Digimon Adventure Tri rarely gives us insight. Like, why did Himekawa hide information from the DigiDestined? What was Yggdrasils ultimate plan? What sparked his decision? You don&#039;t come up with the idea to destroy the human world just because you&#039;re bored.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is mediocre, unremarkable and generic. Two of the better tracks are the Tri version of &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Brave Heart&quot;, but even they are just remixes from Digimon Adventure. &quot;Butterfly&quot; has been used in like 3 different versions in the last episode alone. I like this track, but why not be a bit more ... creative?<br />
<br />
The animation quality is also only mediocre at best. Especially in the last movie, so many still images are used, that you get the feeling that there&#039;s no animation at all. It makes the movie look poor with a low production value. I also expected a much better choreography of the Digimon&#039;s moves, because you know ... it&#039;s 2018 (or at least 2015).<br />
<br />
There are some additional things that bugged me, for example:<br />
<br />
a) The absence of logic in the final fight. There were some game changing moves pulled out of thin air, just to have a happy ending. How should I be able to feel the thrill of danger, if it&#039;s clear beforehand that our DigiDestined will overcome every obstacle?<br />
<br />
b) Digimon only act a plot devices, rather than characters. Something I liked about Digimon Adventure back in the days was it&#039;s emphasis on both the human world, digital world and the human characters and Digimon alike (think about the Ogremon vs. Leomon conflict). Nothing of that remained in Digimon Adventure Tri.<br />
<br />
Fans will probably like the returning characters and their Digimon partners, as well as the new mega evolutions we never got to see in action when we were kids. Aside from the fact that the story isn&#039;t entirely trash and the characters are at least average, I have very few other positive things to say about Digimon Adventure Tri as a whole. Sadly, I can&#039;t recommend it to other people, not even fans of the original Digimon Adventure.<br />
<br />
3.5/10

    Once upon a time (2 years ago but whose counting) I gave the first two Digimon tri movies the benefit of the doubt. I had faith that Toei would answer my questions and create a satisfying follow up to their beloved original two seasons. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Digimon tri is trash. Absolute trash that only exists so Toei can grub some money out of a franchise that&#039;s been on the decline for over a decade. The first movie pulls you in with a good balance of fanservice and some intrigue surrounding the 02 cast going missing and it all sharply goes downhill from there.<br />
<br />
Meiko feels like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279809">
        some 13 year olds attempt at a Digimon OC which fits since this whole thing comes off as someone who didn&#039;t like 02&#039;s bitter fanfiction. Honestly if you took her out of the movie and made Meicoomon some random Digimon nothing would change plotwise.<br />
<br />
As for the Season 1 crew, non of them really change or develop at all through the series. If anything they regress at points just so they can rehash character growth they had years ago. And let&#039;s not even talk about how not only is the 02 cast shafted offscreen for the entire 6 movies but noone in the Season one cast ever concerned about their friends/comrades who have been missing for weeks, maybe even months.<br />
<br />
It really does feel like the writer hates season 2 and is really only barely willing to acknowledge it exists.<br />
<br />
And let&#039;s not forget the &quot;villain&quot; Dark Gennai who is absolute trash. Despite this series clearly wanting to tug you in by doing bad things to these characters you care about they give you the most cartoonishly evil bad guy I&#039;ve seen in a Digimon series. I could take Leviathan from Applimon more seriously than this shmuck.<br />
<br />
But worst of all is the homogenization of the Digimon partners who all basically became the same overly childish, loud, and obnoxious group of sidekicks since the fucking Minions. Ya know, except for the brief few minutes where the movie needed to remind you that Biyomon &quot;caaaaaaaares about Sora&quot;.<br />
<br />
The story comes across as super muddled too cramming in things like Homeostasis, universal reboots, amnesia and a very unsatisfying rendition of the &quot;original Digidestined&quot; that were briefly mentioned in the original show. It&#039;s almost like this was meant to be a full TV show that got ponded into a movie series mold in order to scrape a few more dollary doos out of it. Also, Crunchyroll&#039;s awful choice to then awkwardly chop those &quot;movies&quot; back into episodes in order to scrape together some extra ad hits is also egregious.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack really pales in comparison to the original show too. While the Butterfly and Brave Heart remixes are fine, Brave Heart gets dropped completely at some point leading to really unfitting evolution/battle scenes with Butterfly draped over them.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also some very heavy plotholes with the story. Like Agumon having memories of the OG special from before season 1 despite it being stated in season 1 that that was a different Koromon. Or the part where they need their memories to hit the Mega stage despite Biyomon and Patamon doing that already without their memories.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s more I could say about how much this movie does wrong in my eyes but I think I&#039;ll leave it here for now. Tri as a whole gets like a 3.5/10 from and this last movie gets a 2/10.

    This is based on my assumptions.<br />
Initially, I was expecting to be a longer series but not a 6 piece. If you take a look, Both DA and DA02 had 50+ episodes while this is halved. <br />
My biggest issue is that, they rather limit to a 6 piece movie so everything will rush itself at first, and then bait you with a possible installment due to the open end, it&#039;s very unorganized.<br />
Imagine if being an actual continuation from the open end, it would likely be worse as everything was thrown out into the first 6 already. <br />
<br />
Perhaps if Toei had given the series much more time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279792">
        instead of just 6 movies at once, the characters and story would have been way better given proper pacing. [The worse is that, this was an anniversary project, it feels like they&#039;re betraying fans expectation with this as a result to milk this to my opinion]<br />
<br />
Onto the review!<br />
Story: 6<br />
Yeah honestly the story went downhill (messy too) since and to my opinion after the 3rd movie. A lot of things like the character build ups were neglected, I would say maybe it&#039;s because of the pacing? There&#039;s only so much you can fill with 6 movies while bringing out too many things. Things will be skipped. 6 for the story because it&#039;s still watchable as long as you&#039;re not focusing on details. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Not much different, the evolution is obviously the same since the first movie. Regarding the still images people were mentioning, I feel like they&#039;re just trying to emphasize on the atmosphere but I really don&#039;t mind it. [&#039;cause I&#039;ve seen worse and this isn&#039;t really a justify cause but lol]<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
I believe they&#039;ve focused on Butterfly a lot due contribution to the deceased artist or so I believe which is fine to my opinion. They still have other tracks which I did enjoy, and the voice casting was great, so I kept this as a 7. <br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
Honestly I might want to give 5 for the original characters they&#039;ve brought up in this series. They  didn&#039;t give much explanation for why all these things happen, and thankfully they actually remembered to relate back the the 02 crew (barely). <br />
The Adventure cast, well there&#039;s not much to comment on, they&#039;ve just left the bonds the same since the original anime, so I felt this was the only good part that hasn&#039;t sunk (especially since the 3rd movie&#039;s reboot scene and this data restoration scene). Again, I believe they brought up too much for the limited space they have so potentials couldn&#039;t be achieved. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8 [This movie only]<br />
I love the main Adventure cast and they kept to it at the very least, even though the plot was messy, I simply love it. I&#039;ve still teared up a bit throughout the entire movie, and I had some good laughs, especially Patamon&#039;s bit. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7 (6.5 for the main focus)<br />
I won&#039;t recommend if you&#039;re the type to focus on the actual plot, or for the entire franchise. Rather, it&#039;s hard to recommend unless maybe you&#039;re not the type to care. I understand people&#039;s resentment to this movie series however to me... Well this is simply a childhood title that I can&#039;t really abandon even if it drags itself through the mud.

    This is a review for all 6 movies. Some spoiler are included because they show just how much of a mess these movies were. And it&#039;s nothing the freaking posters didn&#039;t spoil anyway.<br />
<br />
As a big fan of Digimon Adventure (one of the first anime I ever watched) I was looking forward to a continuation. I know 02 had a lot of flaws. I didn&#039;t really like the ending to it and was looking forward to maybe a retcon. I did not get my wish. What I got was a continuation that pretty much spat in the face of almost every Digimon Adventure fan. They did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281241">
        not get a single thing right in these &quot;movies&quot;. I use quotation makrs because they are not really movies. It&#039;s a 2 cour series bungled into 6 movies. That alone created problems to the story. So let&#039;s get into it, shall we?<br />
<br />
Story: The 2nd biggest offender of these movies. The story is weak. Very weak. And at times is just doesn&#039;t make sense. Digimon can now go berserk and gain a giant boost of power. And I mean GIANT. It&#039;s like the levels don&#039;t even matter anymore. It&#039;s really a very simple story and you would think that being that simple it would be hard to get it wrong. But they do. They don&#039;t explain what they should be explaining when it happens. You have to wait a long time and sometimes you still don&#039;t get an explanation. The story immediately removes the cast of 02 from the movies and focuses on the original cast. Not really a problem if the 02 casts would have actually mattered for anything, but they literally don&#039;t. They&#039;re not even shown. The movies also tried to get you to care for a new characters: Mei and Meikomon. While Meikomon is cute, and has a slight development, Mei is worthless and brings the movies down. She&#039;s like a self-insert character written for the fanfic of a 12-year old girl who has a crush on Taichi. The pacing of these movies is absolutely terrible, in part because it&#039;s really a TV series and in part because it&#039;s plagues by filler. And I mean the bad kind of filler that&#039;s not even remotely interesting or important. Characters will stop the story to wallow in self-pity and angst for 30 minutes then go back to doing something plot related for 10 then spent 20 minutes doing slice-of-life BS. This happens in every movie. And by the end of the last movie, guess what?  Nothing really mattered, nothing was really solved and they&#039;re just going to keep milking this. Oh, and the original Degidestined were retconned into not being the first digidestined. I guess that flashback in Adventure was just Homeostasis (the spirit who was possessing Hikari) lying.  Oh, and there&#039;s this evil version of Gennai who&#039;s basically a stalker who likes to lick people. And he&#039;s evil and wants to do something. Something evil. And there&#039;s these 2 adults who were part of the original digidestined, and one of them goes nuts because her partner died and she wants to reset the digital work so that her partner come back to life. It works, but obviously the digimon no longer has his memory. Whoos. All the partner digimon also lose their memory which means one movie of BS with them trying to become friends again. But they get their memories back anyone two movies later so that was pointless. And why did they reset the digiworld anyway since the virus wasn&#039;t PART of the digital work so it would not have been affected anyway. And it wasn&#039;t. Whoops.<br />
<br />
Art: Pretty good designs for the older cast. And that&#039;s where the compliments end. This show has terrible animation. That is when it botheres to HAVE animation. Many MANY scenes, including action scenes are slideshows of static pictures. The most glaring is a dance sequence in the 2nd or 3rd movie with literally no movement. I know TOEI have a reputation for being cheap, but this was a new low. Hey, rememeber how every digimon had it&#039;s own style for the evolution to Perfect and Mega levels? That&#039;s gone. Everyone uses the same uninspired and poorly animataed transformation for every level and every transformation. Who needs orginality anyway? I will give them credit for the fights that have Omegamon, Alphamon and Jesmon. Those were great.... but didn&#039;t ammount to anything. The final boss does have a nice desing but it&#039;s completely wastes since said boss was hardly animated.<br />
<br />
Sound: Not much to say. They use the same theme songs but re-recorded. They don&#039;t sound as good as the originals. The voices are OK as well. Sound effects as well. The BGM is not memorable but it does its job. <br />
<br />
Character: Way to ruin our favorites, TOEI. I know they grew up and have more issues to deal with, but come on. They turned Taichi from a fearless leader (his crest is COURAGE for pitty&#039;s sale) to a angsty mess who gets too scared to fight because people might get hurt.... WHILE PEOPLE ARE LITEARALLY GETTING HURT. Joe was also completely ruined. He already had a big epithamy in the TV show, but now he&#039;d rather stay home and study then fight alongside his friends. Dude, I know you have exams, but you won&#039;t make it to them IF THE WORLD EXPLODES. They dragged this out for an entire movie. Also, Sora is jumping between Taichi and Matt because she can&#039;t decide who she really likes. Spoiler, it&#039;s Matt. Everyone already knew this. TK, who now dresses like the kind of hipster who thinks Starbucks is the best place in Earth, does the stupidest thing in the show by basically allowing his infected partner to infect every other partner. Mimi is now apparantly selfish because she takes too much initiative and drags people into her ideas. People that did not object to a single thing she said but now feel offended that she did not ask for their opinion. THEN SAY SOMETHING WHEN SHE PROPOSED IT! And then Mimi still comes to the conclusion that it was her fault. What? Hikari is sad for all 6 movies but I do not know why. Matt and Koushiro were pretty much the only ones acting like themselves. The digimon no longer have any personality beyond a single charatcer trait. Agumon eats a lot, Gabumon is shy, Patamon is cute, etc... And let&#039;s not forget the worse chcratcer of the movies: Mei. What a worthless sack of meat. She didn&#039;t do a damn thing for the whole thing and yet she&#039;s still written like we&#039;re supposed to feel sorry for her. At least Meikomon turned out to be the source of the virus (for some reason).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: What enjoyment? The only reason I finished them was because the 3rd movie was actually good and gave me hope. And not just good, but DAMN good. What happened? Did the good writers escape the prison for a movie? Fooled me once, shame on you. Fooled me twice, shame on me. Fooled me thrise, I&#039;m a moron. This was a slog to get though. I wanted to skip half the scenes because they were just saying the same thing over and over again, but I was afraid I&#039;d miss something. There was nothing to miss. This was pain. Pure pain. Not even the asspull of a new Omegamon form could make me smile.<br />
<br />
Overall: This was a cashgrab. Not idea how much money they made but they didn&#039;t spend much anyway. If you really need your nostalgia tickled, I guess you could watch these movie. But you will most likely be sad by the end. Sad that this could have been a good story. But it wasn&#039;t.

    Quick note: I&#039;ve been a Digimon fan since I was 7 years old. I&#039;m 28 now. I&#039;ve watched all Digimon media released up to this point and I&#039;ve played a few Digimon videogames as well. <br />
<br />
Last movie left me disappointed and this one... well. Beware of SPOILERS because it&#039;s impossible to review this movie without them. <br />
<br />
Taichi was alive and well all this time but FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON Nishijima, which fell at the same exact time and place as Taichi did, is fatally injured. Yes, a Digimon film features a human death aka irreversible death. How lovely! Actually, it&#039;s not the only one because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339112">
        Himekawa also dies!!! And Meicoomon is never seen or heard of again, even after a 3 months time skip!!!!<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t you just love when an awesome child-friendly anime from 1999 just turns on itself for no reason and betrays everything that it stands for? Whatever happened to &quot;Friendship equals infinite power and that power will make everything okay and happy in the end?&quot;. We basically get the usual AlphaDigiBoys wanting to murder Meicoomon and Hikari being all badass &quot;Fluff you guys, I&#039;m going to battle too to make sure we can save her!!!!&quot; only to still end up with Meicoomon&#039;s perma-death. <br />
<br />
I honestly feel cheated out of this perfect chance to revisit my childhood memories and nostalgia. <br />
<br />
The most amusing part of the movie was actually the awesome tag-team action between Togemon and Birdramon. Everything else was kind of lackluster. <br />
<br />
And of course the annoying villain whose real identity is never truly revealed escapes safe and sound and with the means to wreak avoc once again. <br />
<br />
Right. So why a 7/10? The movie ends with the entire Digimon main cast singing Brave Heart and I&#039;m a sucker for that kind of stuff and we get a some-what resolution to the story. The kids (minus Meiko) are doing okay, the world is doing okay and the Digimon-partners are still a part of the kids&#039; lives. It is a watchable movie but the end will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth afterwards.

    ok i feel the need to write the review cause i see a lot of people badmouthing the show.<br />
<br />
If you are my age(30 yo) then probably digimon was one of the first anime you watched and got to live the magic of anime.<br />
<br />
Digimon adventure imo is a masterpiece of  90&#039;s with beautiful story cool chars and lots of adventure and feels.Personally i didn&#039;t like the rest of the franchise shows.<br />
<br />
Anyway back to digimon tri...for me it was a chance to relive so many memories and feels, to see how the chars grew up after all these years .I was so excited that i could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285428">
        watch new adventures with my old pals (I mean the characters)  to hear the new version of my favorite anime soundtracks....Seriously if you are younger than 25 you dont get it.so dont bother watching it.You probably loved more digimon tamers which was so meh compared to digimon adventure 1 and 2 but the last good season of digimon.<br />
<br />
long story short I loved  the story the new animation for evolution the character development and the new versions of the songs.<br />
<br />
what i didn&#039;t like(spoilers alert):<br />
<br />
1.I would prefer a to be a Tv show with 50 episodes like the rest of them.<br />
<br />
2.i feel like after the last battle they rushed to the end.<br />
I&#039;d like to see a funeral for  Daigo Nishijima, and &#039;d like to learn what happened with <br />
Maki Himekawa .<br />
<br />
3.i didnt like the fact that we never got to learn how Daisuke and the others found out the truth and how they got caught up.Also i&#039;d like to see them fight in the last battle.<br />
<br />
4.i&#039;d like to see meicoomon reborn as we&#039;ve seen happen before with digimons that died.but i do give them credits for not doing it because after a big fight like that there should be casualties.<br />
<br />
thats all!<br />
<br />
if you loved the first 2 adventures watch it if you didn&#039;t,don&#039;t .simple as that.

    I grew up with Digimon Adventure and I was looking forward to the &quot;movies&quot;.<br />
<br />
When you have a special connecting with a series, then you feel overwhelmed and nostalgic- so it was when I rewatched the two Digimon Adventure Season, to know, where Digimon ended and to understand what will come next.<br />
<br />
While I was rewatching it, I wasn&#039;t disappointed at all- the characters were lovely, the artwork was original, the plot stunning and the dialogues and morals perfect.<br />
<br />
But Digimon lost all his charms within 6 movies. To even think about that, how all the years Digimon was a genre on his own, it got destroyed in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282276">
        12 hours.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
basically we have our beloved characters plus a newbie which doesn&#039;t fit at all. The digimon of the newbie has so much power, that it can destroy both worlds- real world and digi world, and the evil &quot;mastermind&quot; behind this is yggdrasil.<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
1) Characters are poorly, poorly writen.<br />
2) no improvment in plot.<br />
Despite of the poor writen character, which weren&#039;t charming at all, just a pain in da&#039; a**, the plot would fit into 1 Episode. But of course you need some character development or some background stories to make it more enjoyable and not like a documentary, which just gives us the facts, but in all those 6 movies they just stand, doing nothing but eating food and complain or complain how they should not complain!<br />
<br />
3) where are Daisuke and friends?<br />
Do you know, what was really interesting form the beginning? The first movie shows us a red scene, where Daisuke and his friends were knocked out. Since then no one ever asked about them, like they don&#039;t exist at all!<br />
Hikari and Takeru, those two idiots have been fighting alongside them, but they can&#039;t use their brains. Anyway, finally in movie 6 when I thought &quot;yeah we found them&quot; we couldn&#039; even see their faces and they even did not show up for a fight. <br />
<br />
4) Yggdrasil<br />
Who is that? Why did the anime not talk about it on detail? &quot;know your friends but know your enemies better&quot;. So I checked it up and Yggdrasil is a bodyless mind of the digiworld who wants war and not peace like homoestasis. Well, now that makes sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Artwork<br />
Do I need to say anything about the Artwork? No. Because Artwork shouldn&#039;t be a main reason to hate an anime. It wasn&#039;t good, but with a good plot, I would have overlooked it for real. Never the less it wasn&#039;t good animated. There were scenes where it was cancer to my eyes. Just to save money, you see the characters standing for 2 minutes without moving or you see scenes which you saw before. <br />
<br />
6) Again, the writing<br />
there were so many scenes which lacked on good writing. The Hikari Taichi scenes for example. I did not cry but I would have with decent writing. Why did they not spend their money on better dialogues or better character development scenes? Interactions? They just could have saved their money by not creating not needed content! I had the thought of cutting all six movies to one 1h 30min movie and I think I could do that. It is, as if the author want us to feel sad about the characters but here I am shaking my head. One moment they cry and then the digimons wants food and then the enemy appear , they fight, they loose, they end up as baby digimons, they eat again - repeat this sh***. <br />
The worst moment was the Hikari-in-her-mind-moment, where you can see her following a digimon which have died in the first season. It could have been better. It could have been more emotional. <br />
<br />
<br />
7) Mei-chan<br />
I really don&#039;t have anything against a new character, because there are more boys than girls and they need to marry each other, so we need one girl for Taichi. Even if they did not ended up together at the end, the author might have the crazy idea to make another 6 movies just so the romance can improve (god, please don&#039;t let that happen).<br />
<br />
Mei is a pain. For my eyes, for my ears and for my brain. All she can do was crying, like Mimi wasn&#039;t enough yet. She even shares the same name as her digimon and they don&#039;t find that weird at all? I mean with good writing it would have been sweet, that the &quot;bad&quot; digimon has a connecting because of the name, like it would be &quot;fate&quot; that they met, but where did we get PROPER screentime for that?<br />
<br />
- I did not enjoy this movie, and I did not enjoy the rest. The only thing which was good was the sound. To hold on to the old opening was a great strategic, even the soundracks were the same which was awesome.<br />
So here you got it, Toei Animation, you got your one point, because of the sound, which was old content.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
shit.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
Art: 1<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Character: 1<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
Overall: 1

    No payoff for any of the millions of questions raised during the previous five movies, and an incredibly blue balling resolution to the 02 kids tease in the first movie. The only things that get revealed are the identity of Hackmon and an undoing of a facet of the entire premise of the second half of the series. That facet hasn&#039;t been relevant since the fourth movie, but it was still a changed status quo.<br />

As with the previous entries, it&#039;s barely even animated. The sky is an ugly digital filter. Atrocious. <br />

    This was a huge disappointment, as a fan of original 01 and 02 I feel like I&#039;m scarred for life. Feels like If I&#039;ve been forced to make the series all in 12 hours without being paid. Story is so badly written that it&#039;s almost as if there&#039;s no goal, telling or any outcome/finish with it. Art style just in my opinion doesn&#039;t fit, might be I&#039;m biased because I&#039;m used too much to the old ones and who even decides to pick new art styles anyway. Sound might be the only one decent here for me but there isn&#039;t much soundtracks, it&#039;s just remakes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341441">
        mostly and only one soundtrack actually got to me from the 4th/Soushitsu (Holy beasts creation).<br />
Characters lowkey feel like they got brain damaged throughout the years and became edgy and far more stupid instead of wiser. None of the characters feel like they used to be (talking about both humans and digimons) a person doesn&#039;t change that much while you are still attending schools, about digimons I shouldn&#039;t even talk they are just digimons how do they change except with a partner or through combat. They had fine ideas but poorly executed. One kind of a good thing is showing us the original digidestined, but too bad one of them(Himekawa) was an edgy dumb grown up, the other guy taking Ken&#039;s appearance is even more edgy, using the most generic evil/smart quotes that visited every part of Earth. Now who actually cared about Meicoomon and Mei. I was just being pissed off by what every character was doing. Hikari got possessed started getting seizures everytime. Himekawa almost killed her own previous partner with that crazy look. All of the time we had to have some character supporting the other character with emotions. Evolutions took a huge chunk of episodes and just don&#039;t feel as good as the old ones. I think the best screentime was showing Ordinemon&#039;s thicc booty and thighs. The part with digimons losing their memories was just nonsense, digimons accepted them way too fast, they got it back eventually what we expected anyway. We didn&#039;t see much digimons and didn&#039;t fight many like before it was all revolving around the annoying Meicoomon which acted like a spoiled child. What I dislike in shows is when they make a sequel like this and it one way contradicts with the story they created themselves and you don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s that show anymore in this case it&#039;s not Digimon somehow. I used to watch the first 3 parts, came back to it later and I forgot almost everything that happened, had to rewatch it and I did remember some scenes but a lot of them were just forgotten and that&#039;s a thing of a bad storytelling, it&#039;s not memorable, not much action that&#039;s why it is like this.<br />
So in the end for me this just isn&#039;t it. I might forgot something to tell or point out, but it&#039;s pretty much it.

    Before I start my review, please be aware my review covers my thoughts for all six films of the Digimon Tri film series. That said, on with the review.<br />
<br />
<br />
Digimon Tri serves as a continuation of the Digimon Adventure series featuring the Digidestined as teens where they reunite with their partner Digimon to combat a mysterious computer virus that is causing Digimon to go berserk and tearing portals between reality and the Digital World for the berserk Digimon to wreck havoc. Outside of the eight original Digidestined, they are joined by a new classmate named Meiko Mochizuki and her partner Digimon, Meicoomon.<br />
<br />
Digimon Tri has its fair

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287860">
        share of ups and downs throughout its six-movie series run. The first three films of the series actually offer up the best quality of Tri&#039;s run serving to reconnect older fans to their favorite characters and Digimon from the Adventure TV series (minus the Adventure 02 children), while adding on some new developments faced by the Digidestined children as they deal with the challenges of growing up. At varying points in the film, Taichi and the other Digidestined have their own different challenge affecting them from the developments of their adventure or their high school lives that affect them to varying degrees. From dealing with personal flaws to overcoming self-conflict, the film does a solid job with devoting further development to them.<br />
<br />
The new characters of Meiko and Meicoomon are a bit of a mixed bag with their addition to Tri. On the one hand, they play a rather significant role with driving the major plot of the film series that leads to some interesting developments in exploring the partner dynamics between the human Digidestined and their Digimon partners. On the other hand, their characters leave quite a bit to be desired as Mei is the archetypal shy and nervous glasses girl who doesn&#039;t really grow much out of the character type, and Meicoomon doesn&#039;t have much to work with as a character beyond her serious developments toward later in Tri that the film series tries playing up as tragic, yet had me feeling rather indifferent to her situation due to her lack of dimension as a character.<br />
<br />
The major crux of Tri and the driving force behind its existence has to do with the mysterious virus and wormholes affecting reality and the Digital World. While I won&#039;t spoil too much, all I&#039;ll say is what is ultimately revealed behind the cause surrounding both developments and the reasons behind them are rather weak and felt lazily thought out in motivations and execution. Concepts from prior Digimon seasons are brought up, yet Tri haphazardly jumps around them and doesn&#039;t smoothly integrate them into the film in a coherent fashion as they felt tacked on just for the sake of making a nod to a long-time Digimon fan or to add padding for the runtime of any of the films. Worst of all, Tri leaves things unresolved for a certain villainous character&#039;s presence as he is still at large by the end of the film series, implying he may make a return in future installments of the Digimon franchise.<br />
<br />
In regards of presentation, Digimon Tri is a mixed bag. Scenery is vivid with a decent amount of detail and character designs sport more polish and detail than the original Adventure TV seasons, especially in regards to the updated designs of the now teenage Digidestined. However, the animation quality is rather subpar as animation shortcuts are usually milked and character model quality often degrades during action scenes when the animators attempt to put more fluid movement into them.<br />
<br />
As a fan of the first Digimon Adventure series, I must admit that I&#039;m rather disappointed in this film series. While offering up some solid developments with the human Digidestined and their Digimon partner dynamics, the main conflict of Tri felt rather sloppy in execution and development as events progressed in the film series. Plus for a movie, the production quality left much to be desired. Overall, Digimon Tri is a rather mixed package with what it offers up for older and newer generations of Digimon fans.

    This is a review for the entirety of Tri. There are SPOILERS ahead:<br />
<br />
Digimon Adventure Tri was ... quite a ride, for better and for worse. A ride that sometimes tried to give us something exciting but more often than not was just satisfied to give us lazy excuses for fanservice and plays with nostalgia to reach into our wallets. <br />
<br />
The original Adventure 01 show has quite the dedicated following and it&#039;s pretty clear why: It told a story that cared about its own characters which in return made us care. The stakes felt real. The characters themselves felt so real that more than a decade

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279887">
        later, there are still people talking about and loving these kids and their Digimon. It gave us thrill, excitement and genuine bonds. More importantly, the story itself treated its young audience not as &quot;kids who can&#039;t yet handle certain things&quot;. It respected us and confronted us with situations that were meant to make us grow: adoption, loss, and much more. Of course, it was made in the first place to boost merchandise sales but there was still genuine intent on delivering a great story working behind it.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s definitely gone in Tri. <br />
<br />
When Tri came around, people got excited: The kids we loved as kids are now graduating from high school just like we are! Taichi&#039;s lost and directionless now just like many of us! It&#039;s marketed at a more grown up audience. It&#039;s even going to be darker!<br />
<br />
Now that it&#039;s over, did Tri deliver what we were promised back in 2014? A clear no. <br />
<br />
Tri often simply did not try. Sometimes (mostly in the first three movies) it actually managed to catch the feeling of the original series but in a more mature context. There were moments that would make everyone who&#039;s grown up with these kids fill with joy. Even give them goosebumps, like when everyone shows up to fight at the airport in the first movie and the soundtrack kicks in. When Omnimon appears to fight Alphamon. That bittersweet moment with HerkulesKabuterimon. Even when you first see Taichi&#039;s face. The face you haven&#039;t seen in such a long time. <br />
<br />
There are lots of potentially great moments like this throughout Tri but most of them fall flat on its face due to stiff and clumsy execution. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem in Tri is a mix of bad animation and character design and completely apathetic behavior resulting from bad writing. It&#039;s not just a matter of many still images throughout the entirety of these movies, it&#039;s the awful lack of details in facial expressions, bodies and body language that makes Tri a hard watch and breaks the immersion in the most crucial of moments. The gang&#039;s reaction to Taichi&#039;s potential death, for example, in the fifth movie was met with blank expressions. To call it shock would clearly be an overstatement, it was mild surprise at best that showed on their faces. Your best friend and leader, who kicked you out of so many situations, is probably dead and you just go &quot;oh&quot;. One of your friends from the 02 cast shows up corrupted and evil again and you also only go &quot;oh&quot;. I wish I&#039;d be exaggerating but after watching it for the third time last week, with the nostalgia googles worn off, it was impossible to ignore how badly the animation affected what should have been emotional highlights. Even just small things like Taichi barely having a scratch after falling while Nishijima is bleeding everywhere feels ... kinda ... weird. Why not tear Taichi&#039;s shirt at the sleeves or something? Put some scratches in his face? Just to show he&#039;s been through what he has been through: nearly being crushed by big stones! Certainly adding these few lines wouldn&#039;t have been too expensive for Toei... Things like this in design and expression just serve to break the immersion and kill off any sort of danger that the audience could feel. Just imagine a live action movie where the action hero just barely escapes a big explosion after a hard fight but his suit miraculously has no dirt on or holes in it, basically being ready to be taken to a wedding the second the explosion happened. As if it came straight out of the washing machine. But dried. Weird, right? You&#039;d call it badly made. <br />
<br />
But its not all the animation departments&#039; fault, the writing itself is clumsy with the characters barely reacting to anything like any sane person in that situation would do. After Ken&#039;s surprising reemergence as the Digimon Emperor, the writers did not think it was necessary for the 01 gang to show much of a concern about the recent events. Hikari and Takeru halfheartedly knocking at Ken&#039;s door and immediately shrugging it off when nobody answered is bizarre at least. After all this guy saved the world with them. They bonded. In a show where relationships are so important for them to overcome anything life throws at them, this was quite ... unnatural? Unnatural is a good word for anything that happens in Tri after Ken&#039;s reveal: Nobody reacting to Maki when she comes up with a D3-Digivice that looked exactly like Ken&#039;s, Yamato (the guy who has the crest of friendship) being basically satisfied with a &quot;the 02 kids are probably somewhere and probably fine&quot; from Maki, the 01 gang being all happy telling scary stories to each other while knowing that the world is going to turn to shit if they don&#039;t move fast enough to save it, megas one-shoted but minutes later champions resist the same attacks, Hikari going straight to &quot;I won&#039;t forgive you&quot; after Taichi&#039;s reappearance, et cetera. Hikari&#039;s overall trauma about her brother&#039;s death was so unnatural, awkward and jarring that it stands as a perfect example about how the writing team had no clue whatsoever about how you get real, tangible emotions across via dialogue, reaction and body language. Now tell me, why should the audience care about the faith of their world and about them if they themselves don&#039;t the care the least bit? <br />
<br />
The story itself is a busy mess too. It&#039;s basically stumbling over ideas that sometimes you can&#039;t help but wonder if they had just come up with it moments before production of the next movie. (Also, none of those plotpoints were really resolved, even if a status quo was established at the end.) It feels like an obvious sequelbait and with a new project announced and the mysterious dark Gennai ending its appearance with &quot;Should I use Daemon or Diaborumon next&quot; it&#039;s clear that there&#039;s more to come. Maki&#039;s story also wasn&#039;t even finished in this so there&#039;s another thread that needs to be solved. And since the 02 kids&#039; Digimon weren&#039;t even with them when they were saved, it might even be a stark indicator for how the next thing might be 01 related again. Now, I&#039;m not saying the ideas are bad. Busy, yeah, but not bad. In fact, there are many things still left open that could make for an interesting story if someone who cares writes it. Just give us believable reasons for things like why someone like Yggdrasil decided to destroy the world in the first place because none of that got explained and as a consequence it just ends up feeling like &quot;ah, it&#039;s there because we needed a plot. Not a reason to explain anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now there&#039;s a lot of criticism in this review and I&#039;m sure many would agree on what&#039;s been said here but I&#039;m also sure that there are many who nonetheless enjoyed it. Seeing these guys again felt good and the timing was perfect with many of us being in similar life situations like Taichi or Joe. Or the whole crew in general, since graduating from high school is also the time were people lose touch with each other just like them. When it delivered these things, it felt amazing and it was great to speculate and interact with people who came back together to talk about this new era for Digimon.  It did succeed in reuniting many people and to remind us of the reasons why 01 has such a special place in our hearts. Nevermind that sometimes we had to see so much digivolution stock footage (badly drawn even. I mean, Lilymon...aua) that they had to play &quot;Brave Heart&quot; twice or that plot points disappeared and appeared out of nowhere. Nevermind the hypocrisy when Taichi discovered the 02 kids and acted like the original Digi-destined have been desperately searching for them. <br />
<br />
The first viewing was and remains special for many Digimon fans (at least up to part 4). Is it perfect? Hell no! Is it complete and utter garbage? Well, for the reasons listed above it saves itself for fans, somehow, even if repeated viewings will make that secondary bittersweet taste in your mouth grow and grow. But yeah for every none fan it&#039;s unwatchable. That pains to say. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the Tri that these characters deserved. It&#039;s not the Tri we as audience even deserved and far from what we really, really wanted. It&#039;s what we&#039;ve got. Lots of lazy, badly executed stuff and a few  bright spots and its those that at least gave us what we wanted: To truly be with this crew again. <br />

    *This review covers the whole series and contains spoilers*<br />
<br />
Digimon Adventure tri. had a lot of things I liked. Bringing back the original cast, giving it a slightly more mature feel, the storyline of Himekawa, the reference to the Dark Ocean, and more. However, there were a lot of gripes I had while watching it; the complete disregard for the 02 cast, Meiko&#039;s character in general, the reference to the Dark Ocean, the personalities of the partner Digimon being generalized to be like children.<br />
<br />
As someone who grew up on the original Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, I was very excited not only to see the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282370">
        characters I grew up with grow up with me, but for the prospect of bringing the cast of the original series and 02 together for one big adventure. Each installment I would eagerly ask if this was the one that would bring the 02 kids into the story and every time, the answer was no. Even after they found and rescued the missing 02 cast, we got nothing more than silhouettes. It seemed extremely weird for none of the cast to really try and contact them, seeing as how a new digi-threat emerged and they could have helped. The closest thing we got to the 02 cast joining the story was an evil Gennai taking the form of the Digimon Kaiser. It felt like th writer wanted to do everything they could to pretend they didn&#039;t exist short of retconning them out of the canon. Instead, we got Meiko as a new character. Meiko is by definition, a &quot;Mary Sue&quot;; an idealized character that the rest of the characters will love unconditionally. She was just a bashful, “moe” through clumsiness trope. There was an abundance of moments where either Mei-chan or the other Mei-chan (I hate how they were both called Mei-chan) were shown obvious favoritism; Whether it be her hidden talents, how she can tell great scary stories, or how the main cast treated her like one of their old friends. I would expect most of them to openly accept a new digidestined or chosen child, whichever you want to call them, but they treated her as if they&#039;d known her forever. Even Yamato/Matt who&#039;s stand-offish or Joe who&#039;s wary of everything seemed to have no problem with her just showing up out of nowhere. The only time anyone got mad at her was Taichi/Tai when she said she shouldn&#039;t have been born. Meicoomon also got this treatment with Leomon being unable to say no to specifically her, winning the cute/creepy contest to establish that she is in fact the cutest of the group, or being adult/champion level despite her personality being completely a child. Honestly, the plot wouldn’t have been any different if Meiko was never there and would actually have been better if they had given her abundant screen time to any of the original cast as many of them including Yamato/Matt and Sora had very little focus beyond Biyomon’s hesitance to accept Sora after losing her memory. I was especially afraid that they were going to try and make her Taichi/Tai’s love interest, especially at the end (thank you Agumon for dropping that “friends forever”).<br />
<br />
As for a well written original character, Himekawa’s story was very interesting. Having only her partner not be chosen to be saved, its understandable that she would not only resent the Homeostasis for not saving them, but would want to try and find any means to see them again. Seeing Himekawa in the Dark Ocean holding a gun and being surrounded by the creatures that once tried to take Hikari/Kari, I thought that a) she was going to start icing some suckers, and b) that they were going to expand on the Dark Ocean as a concept. But instead she just gave in to the despair and either drowned or was taken by the dark sea creatures to become their new “Hime” (get it? They wanted to find a queen). I was really hoping things would work out for her despite her actions (“hime” means princess). After all, one of the points they made while having a four-way fight between Alphamon, Omegamon, Jesmon, and Meicoomon was that they were going to protect their friend regardless of if it was right or wrong (Her name is “Hime”-kawa). I really wanted her and Nishijima to work things out and be able to be happy together. (I’m hilarious… That’s actually a really messed up ending for her. I am not comfortable with that)<br />
<br />
There were many parts through the series that tugged on my heart. Takeru/Tk finding out Patamon was infected and being unable to tell anyone, Patamon realizing it and sitting in the dark with Takeru/Tk, each of the Digimon trying to spend as much time with their partner before the reboot, the reboot that cause all of the Digimon to lose their memories (and while it was obvious they would get them back, the character’s reactions to that loss is what hurt), Nishijima in the bunker, and most of all Hikari/Kari’s reaction to Taichi/Tai going missing after Jesmon’s attack. Hikari/Kari has always gotten the supporting character treatment, but her role is important none the less. Whether it was her helping the other characters with their issues, being the “light” of the group, or having the perpetual target on her back for being possessed, she’s shown to still be the strong character that she was when she handed herself over to Myotismon to save to world.<br />
<br />
The Digimon partners seemed to lose a part of their individuality in tri, basically making them into a group of kids needing to be babysat. Even Gatomon/Tailmon who’s the adult of the group acted more childlike. There were moments where she became an adult again when the plot needed it but then she’d just regress back to being a kid. There were also points in the digital world where certain child/rookie level Digimon’s attacks could stand up to or neutralize certain ultimate/mega level Digimon’s.<br />
<br />
There’s enough done right in tri for it to be very enjoyable, but there were many problems with it. If you’re a long-term fan of the series, then seeing all of the little details thrown in can be very satisfying. If you’re not as big a fan, then a lot of the things that bothered the hardcore fans probably won’t bother you. Still, hearing them all sing Butterfly at the end made me very happy.

    ENG: this latest movie ends the new digidestined adventure in a simple but good way. Nothing perfect or incredible, but the movie managed to be better than the previous one. The animation remains the quality of the first film (which is fine, but what was that about the film focusing on the Ordinemon&#039;s butt!? My God!). The soundtrack is good as well, but there was a larger repetition of some songs (compared to the previous five films), which may irritate some people (this was not my case, but it almost happens). The film ends with a feeling that there are still very important things to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287725">
        complete (but in other things it concludes well, respecting some consequences that arose during those 6 films). Finishing, the movie is cool, but it could have a more interesting and not so generic climax.<br />
<br />
PORT: esse último filme encerra a nova aventura dos digiescolhidos de forma simples, porém boa. Nada perfeito ou incrível, mas o filme  conseguiu ser melhor do que o anterior. A animação se mantém na qualidade do primeiro filme (o que é bom, mas o que foi aquilo do filme ficar focando de perto a bunda de Ordinemon?! Meu Deus!). A parte sonora está também boa, mas houve uma repetição maior de algumas músicas (comparando com os outros cinco filmes anteriores), o que pode irritar algumas pessoas ( não foi o meu caso, mas isso quase acontece). O filme termina com uma sensação de que ainda há coisas muito importantes para concluir ( mas em outras coisas ele conclue bem, respeitando algumas consequencias que surgiram durante esses 6 filmes). Finalizando, o filme é legal, mas ele poderia ter um clímax mais interessante e não tão genérico.

    **THIS IS A REVIEW OF ALL 6 MOVIES**<br />
**CONTAINS SPOILERS!!**<br />
<br />
*Animation*<br />
<br />
What bothers me the most in the entire Digimon Tri is the lack of facial animations and how emotions are displayed. I remember seeing <br />
many scenes where terrible things are happening in front of the characters eyes and they look like they don&#039;t even care. Sure they are <br />
adults and all but if they keep talking about things like friendship and digimon companions, I would expect to see a little more shock <br />
in their faces when things go bad. The biggest insult however is the fact that many times I see characters staring to distance without <br />
even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310080">
        saying anything to each other like they forgot their own lines or something. Like cmon, atleast try to create convincing discussion about something..<br />
<br />
*Fights*<br />
<br />
All the fights between the digimons seem to be a bit rushed and there are even scenes where certain powerful digimons get beaten by a <br />
significantly weaker digimons. (Example: Magna Angemon ((Ultimate level digimon)) gets beaten by Devimon ((Champion level digimon)). <br />
If evolutions mean nothing and all the digimons can suddenly be as strong as any other digimon what is even the point of the evolution?<br />
<br />
*Story*<br />
<br />
Its a mess. There is this digimon that somehow is key for destroying the human world and digital world and its human partner is somehow <br />
a link that was suppressing it from going berserk. However in the end they will just outright murder the digimon because there was <br />
nothing else left to do. Thats some nice companionship isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t like Digimon Tri very much. If it was up to me to decide this show wouldn&#039;t even exist. Its clearly riding on the nostalgia of the older series and does many things too wrong.

    Nostalgia&#039;s a powerful thing. As a whole, I&#039;ve been wondering who&#039;s the intended demographic for these DigiTri films. The general direction &amp; connecting narrative is almost, just almost, mature &amp; slightly philosophical for fans of Adventure 01/ Digifans who grew up on the series. But at times it still feels campy &amp; cliche enough for the kiddies/new generation to enjoy.<br />
<br />
True, I&#039;m a bit rusty of my Adventure 01 &amp; 02 lore. But more so in No.6 :Mirai, the entire plot feels messy &amp; the pacing&#039;s pretty slow. These sequel films leave a somewhat strange experience when trying to place it within the original timeline &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284491">
        all we&#039;ve learnt from there.<br />
<br />
Again, this could just be the nostalgia speaking, but kudos to the characters &amp; a semblance of development. I really don&#039;t mean to spark a fandom war here, but for a children&#039;s franchise from the 90&#039;s &amp; going forwards : I&#039;ve always felt Digimon&#039;s strongest card was actually getting to know these kids &amp; growing up with them.<br />
<br />
The animation won&#039;t age well in a few years. But for what it&#039;&#039;s worth, I appreciate Toei spicing up the style &amp; visuals. The soundtrack really tugged at my heartstrings. Most notably Braveheart and Butter-fly. You can say it was over-hyped, but in honour of Kouji Wada, you were the light &amp; hope for me. Rest in Peace, you wonderful artist.

    First off, this isn&#039;t a review for just part 6. Since this is the last part, I decided to review Digimon Tri as a while here. <br />
<br />
I really really wanted to love this series, but it just was a disappointment. Starting off with part 1, it was more or less just an introduction to the series. It was a bit slow, but I&#039;ll let the pace go on this one. <br />

Part 2&#039;s pacing was pretty bad. But I loved how they gave character development for Mimi and Joe. I am serious these two honestly got fantastic development, but unfortunately the majority of this part was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280281">
        a culture festival and hot springs. It wasn&#039;t until the very end of this part where we finally got the real conflict of Tri introduced.<br />
<br />
Part 3.... was absolutely brilliant. The emotion, the pacing, the storytelling, everything was amazing. I did not expect the ending of the fourth episode to happen the way it did, I did not expect the tears it would make me cry, but man was this part powerful. Unfortunately all good things come to an end.....<br />
<br />
....Part 4 was absolutely horrible. BIG SPOILERS upcoming. In this part all of the digidestined are struggling with the fact that their digimon partners do not have any memories of them. But that&#039;s ok, everyone just starts talking with their partners, and BOOM, they all become friends again because their bonds are too strong to break. In fact their bonds are so strong, that they reconnect in one episode. Well this is true for everyone except for Sora and Biyomon. So why do these two not get along, even though Sora&#039;s crest is the crest of love... well fucking plot device. Seriously this is it, the only reason the two don&#039;t get along is so that they have a story they can drag out for the ENTIRE FOUR FUCKING EPISODES!!!!! <br />
<br />
Part 5. The pacing was off, but this was actually a good episode. They are now back in the real world where there is panic happening due to the digimon attacking. They actually get arrested because they are in cahoots with the digimon. But thankfully they are saved by Nishijima. Oh by the way, him and Himekawa are revealed to be part of the former digidestined that we heard about all the way back in part 1. I freaking loved this, not only that, but I loved how they made the story tragic.<br />
<br />
Part 6..... it was a very mixed ending. On one hand, they made the ending something you wouldn&#039;t expect from Digimon, on the other hand, the handling of the 02 kids made me very angry. They have been gone this whole time, and none of the original kids were worried about them at all..... it just made no sense what so ever. <br />
<br />
So all in all, there were good parts about Digimon Tri, but at the end of the day, the story was a mess. They didn&#039;t seem to know where they were going with the series, like nothing was preplanned at the beginning. This is exactly why 02 wasn&#039;t as good as 01, they had general ideas, but did not plan out a whole story

I would not say that Digimon Tri adventure is bad all over, a lot of people go overboard, I particularly liked the 5 movies and even the sixth until the ending, it follows the line of the other movies not being a masterpiece but also not the swamp monster people claim to be , the end however is unforgivable, you can not create a character make him hardly say anything during 6 films, kill him and think that everything is fine because it is not, there are rumors that meiko will not be in the 2020 movie, if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323591">
        true this makes Meiko and Meicoomon look like Filler characters that appear in an anime arc and never mentioned again, it doesn&#039;t matter that people didn&#039;t like the character, using a character just for a movie and in the end taking any chance of the character being useful again is a lazy and stupid solution, it&#039;s a disappointing end to a movie series that was pretty nice in my opinion

    An interesting but unnecessary Digimon story. (A review of all the Tri stories)<br />
<br />
I understand that for the 15th anniversary of Digimon, the studio wanted to do something fun and interesting. This story however feels like it could have been better suited to one of the other Digimon properties. I think a story taking place 3 years after the event in Tamers might have worked better with a more developed digital world. But alas, we returned to the original characters. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
There really isn&#039;t much to say regarding the overall story of the Tri series. There seemed to be more loose ends than answers. The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306534">
        struggled to really find their ground here. It seemed like the producers wanted to have the original characters but in their more grown up state. It made the story unbalanced. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art was actually pretty good. It had a Voltron feel to it, and for the most part, the characters did resemble their original designs (with Mimi being the major exception). There could have been a little more effort to differentiate them, but aside from that, the designs for the digital world and several locations around Japan were amazing. <br />
<br />
Major pet peeve:<br />
If there is one thing that drove me to the point of nearly abandoning the whole series of movies it was  Meicoomon. I swear if I had to hear that little f***er say &quot;Mei&quot; in that whiny voice one more time, I would have put my fist through the TV. As a character, it takes the number one spot of most annoying. A spot I used to hold for Hikari.  Meicoomon was designed and voiced to be &quot;cute&quot; but is just absolutely insufferable. I had kinda hoped they would have killed  Meicoomon off. <br />
<br />
What I liked: <br />
The Digimon design were as good as ever. I was happy to see Patamon &gt; Angemon &gt; MagnaAngemon (can you tell my favorite?). As mentioned before, the locations were great. I did enjoy at some of the new characters introduced and the idea that the world didn&#039;t just forget about Digimon. I did enjoy some of the backstory as well about the &quot;first&quot; digidestined. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Its a good time-waster, but doesn&#039;t really add anything to the series as a whole. If nothing else its an average story.

    The last chapter of Digimon Adventure Tri. is at least a bit better than the whole story. Before I split into each part, this is my opinion about the whole movie series:<br />
Before this, the story has too many flaws. This last chapter is still suffer from the same problem.<br />
How the story turns is not ultimately satisfying. While ending is &quot;acceptable&quot;, it doesn&#039;t  finish everything started within this movie series. Some parts of the story are still wrapped in mystery. The reason why I watched this movie is to see how the ending would be. I have been complaining a lot about the previous movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279804">
        which lacks on literally every aspects, except voice actors line-up. Toei Animation should&#039;ve never created these (kind of) movie series. <br />
<br />
Story [**CONTAINS SPOILER**]:<br />
Like the previous movies, much talk. But fortunately this time they brought more battles to the visual. The outcome of the battles are still easily predicted though. Typical Dejimon logic. How they put the story telling is also very lacking. They show how Taichi escape from Digital World to Real World in the middle of the story. But later they mentioned someone saved Daisuke-kun and the others. It shouldn&#039;t be like this. If the started by someone saved Daisuke-kun and the others first and show how Taichi escaped from Digital Woirld near the end of the story, the impression would be different. In the ending, we don&#039;t know how Himekawa ended up as. We don&#039;t know where Alphamon is as he made no appearance in this movie. Mysterious man is still exists and will likely return with new evil plans. Also, the outcome of the ending is something that can be accomplished before causing so much damage in Real World. They were just pending it and the result is massive damage in real world. That&#039;s why you should never leave the task of saving the world to children. Because they are not capable to think big and see far to the future.<br />

Not my favorite. Toei Animation did great animation on Dragon Ball Super but Digimon Adventure Tri is like a leftover. The battle animation, the environment, the character design, everything feels so much cheaper compared what Toei Animation could done in Dragon Ball Super or previous Dragon Ball Z Movies. In short, very disappointing for a studio who created big titles.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
What to tell... The music sometimes feels of place and has been the case since 1st movie. The best part where the voice actors sing together in the ending is great. The theme songs are very good. But the BGM is what lack the most. Sound effect are not particularly pleasing though.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I admit this movie is less boring than the previous Digimon Adventure Tri movies. But it still has a long way to go to make this movie enjoyable. The part where need to the most improvement is the battle.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I watched this because I started with the first movie and I am curious how the whole story turns out to be. If you haven&#039;t watched the first story, then don&#039;t. It&#039;s a waste of time. I am sorry for being mean to the team who work hard to bring Digimon Adventure Tri to us. This anime has too many holes, especially in story and battle part.
