    A strong cast of characters is sometimes all that is needed. <br />
<br />
Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (referred to as HenNeko henceforth) is a romantic comedy that knows its own strengths. Rather than focusing solely on panties, cleavage and harem tropes (oh, there&#039;s still plenty of that), it delivers a genuinely refreshing experience that cleverly combines its moe appeal with a strong cast of characters. <br />
<br />
The story follows Yokodera Youto and his hidden perversions. Hidden, of course, as joining the track club solely to gape at girls is not considered socially acceptable behavior. He conceals these thoughts under a facade, acting in part as the average

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103355">
        highschooler so that his intentions are not misunderstood. But eventually, as just about any teenager would, he grows tired of behaving like somebody that he is not. He decides to visit a purportedly wish-granting statue to ask that he can simply be himself, and in doing so entangles himself with the fate of another: Tsukiko, who instead wishes to conceal her emotions. <br />
<br />
Immediately, you will probably find yourself thinking how silly this sounds. And you would not be wrong-- it is very much silly. The entire notion that a cat statue can somehow grant wishes (and just about any wish, really) is supremely contrived and difficult to accept. But HenNeko seldom takes this aspect seriously. There are still the occasional moments of melodrama here and there marring the overall experience, but provided you are not looking for anything more than some lighthearted fun, it is easy enough to tolerate the lacklustre storytelling. Perhaps not forgive, though. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the story is not necessarily that it is poorly written or abundant with plotholes, but that it relies solely on the cat statue to get anywhere. Characters don&#039;t resolve issues or develop on their own-- the statue does it for them. If it&#039;s time for some drama, hey, why not have a character wish for something inconvenient? And they do. Again and again. It becomes entirely predictable by the end. How is the audience supposed to empathize with a story that feels so artificial, so reliant upon a single plot device? It is almost too bad that a wish-granting statue doesn&#039;t exist in the real world; it could have been used to wish away the show&#039;s own issues. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the characters are enough to amend the otherwise juvenile storytelling. Aside from the lustful Yokodera, HenNeko consists primarily of three female characters: Tsukiko, the ojou-sama Azuki Azusa (she&#039;s referred to by her full name for some reason), and Tsukushi, Tsukiko&#039;s violent older sister. Chances are that if you have any potential interest in the series, moe is one of the first things that you are looking for. And HenNeko provides plenty in that regard. Hell, it is the embodiment of moe. Tsukiko may just be one of the cutest characters in anime history, though Azuki Azusa is certainly no slouch either. The only issue is that Tsukiko&#039;s seiyuu overblows the dandere trope. She sounds less monotone and more like an android. <br />
<br />
In standard harem fare, they all come to love Yokodera in some way or another. It is justified in the case of Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, but Tsukishi&#039;s infatuation is shoehorned in from nowhere. It also baffles the mind why she somehow believes that Yokodera and his mythical younger brother (which is just a bluff of his) are separate people, despite looking, sounding and behaving identically. Somehow she is collectively the most dense and mature character of the show. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Yokodera, he is actually one of the series&#039; strongest points. For the harem genre where the protagonist is almost invariably some blockhead with the supernatural ability to inadvertently undress girls in mid-air, a comment like that may as well be considered nonsense. But Yokodera defies the genre&#039;s mold. He is honest, knows how to communicate with people, does not run away screaming at the sight of panties, and most importantly, has a brain. He is able to instill value to his interaction with the girls and as a result (Tsukishi excluded) their feelings for him seem authentic rather than forced. HenNeko could just as easily have been another insipid harem title if Yokodera behaved like every other harem lead, but thankfully it is a show that understands the importance of a quality protagonist. I just wonder why other harem titles haven&#039;t learned the same. <br />
<br />
In terms of art, HenNeko is pleasing to the eye and uses thick lines to give the show its own visual charm. Character designs are considerably appealing and while the art fidelity may not be enough to impress, it still does the job just fine. <br />
<br />
The sound also leaves little to be desired. The seiyuu are spectacular all around with veterans like Yukari Tamura and newer names like Kaori Ishihara providing their own personality to the female characters. Yuki Kaji lends his talents to the role of Yokodera and does a stellar job overall (though initially causes some concern for previously voicing a number of aggravating protagonists). And while the background music is restrained and rarely noticeable, the opening and ending sequences are infectiously catchy and adorable. It would be insanity to skip them. <br />
<br />
Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko does not tread any new ground, but what it fails to provide in creativity it makes up for with a solid cast of characters. If you are expecting a decent story, deep themes or anything beyond some nice lighthearted fun, you will be sorely disappointed. <br />
<br />
As for fun, though? There are few better ways to spend an afternoon.

    You know one of those days when you&#039;re feeling down and is hunting for something, anything to calm your moody day? Well, that hunt might not be easy but if Henneko is something on your hit list, then you might of hit a bulls-eye. That&#039;s because this is an anime that will brighten the mood of your moody day. In more ways than one, Henneko caters to the fantasies of a young teenager. It focuses more on Youto Yokodera, a young boy who is going through the journey of adolescence. What he seems to be more interested than sports or academics though is of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103351">
        opposite sex. Thus begin the story, a tale of The &quot;Hentai&quot; Prince and the Stony Cat.<br />
<br />
Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (also known as The &quot;Hentai&quot; Prince and the Stony Cat) is an anime series based off the light novel and manga of the same name. No contrary to its title, this is NOT a hentai. Rather, it&#039;s about a young boy named Youto Yokodera who got nicknamed with the infamous title of the “Hentai Prince” after making a certain wish onto a particuarly gifted Stony Cat. Sounds strange right? Well, that&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
Coming into this series, I already knew what may be expected. It doesn&#039;t take long for any viewer to realize this is a typical romantic comedy. The twist here is that it involves some magic at works in the form of the Stony Cat. So begins this strange tale, the story of the Hentai Prince. Note that not everything starts out like this though. In fact, while it&#039;s obvious that Youto is seen a pervert to viewers, the series doesn&#039;t directly depict these traits until after he makes his wish to the Stony Cat. It&#039;s the result of a wish he made and there&#039;s a saying that always stays true: be careful what you wish for. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Youto , he isn&#039;t very careful and now has to deal with the consequences. <br />
<br />
For Youto, the boy is naturally a pervert. He likes to read &#039;ecchi&#039; magazines of perverted nature. He joined the track team so that he can actually see the girls in their swimsuits (the pool is close to the tracks). And of course, he often references to shows that he watches to heighten his interests. Despite his faults though,Youto  at the same time is also shown to be a kind boy who often comes to the aid of others especially his female friends. He also seems to be somewhat clever with a crafty mind as he is able to manipulate a certain track leader into believing some obvious false ideas. Needless to say, Youto is the type of boy that&#039;s hard to be friends with unless you know his true visage. <br />
<br />
Among the people Youto meets in the series includes the adorable Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi. Being presented as both the mascot as well as the main female character, she is the younger sister of the Steel King and someone that accidentally also falls in the case of &#039;be careful what you wish for&#039; category. Unlike Yuto, the wish she called for made her emotionless. Now, she is like a cat but without the excitement. At the same time, it seems that she and Youto has a sort of deal to get back what they&#039;ve lost. It&#039;s a relationship of awkwardness and benefits all the same time.<br />
<br />
Throughout the series, Youto also establishes connections with other characters in particular with a school beauty named Azusa. As an animal lover, she is admired as a school idol, a wealthy lady, and someone who is to be respected by everyone. Despite her outer self, Azusa seems to be quite insecure with herself and often mistrusts people because of her past. Her first encounter with Youto seems to be some sort of fate because for the first time, we see her insecurities manifest thanks to Youto and his new personality granted by the Stony Cat. So much for being a goddess...<br />
<br />
The series follows more of a story arc telling format rather than a straight out story. However, the most common features of each episode involves Youto and what he does with his new situation. Of the many new changes in his life, one is his more closeness to three of the main female characters in the series. Youto gets closer with Azusa, Tsukushi (the “Steel King”), and Tsukiko as each episode progresses. Despite being labeled as the &#039;hentai prince&#039;, Youto is also surprisingly reliable at key situations. His reliability as well as ability to help others earns him more affections from the girls. As a matter fact, they seems to see the better side of him and even goes to lengths to return the favor at various points. <br />
<br />
There is also a whole cluster of moments and gags that calls out &#039;cute&#039; throughout every episode. The opening song itself is one with the expressions of our main characters. Its animal-like gestures, high pitched vocals, and moe artwork paints this series as a headline for cuteness. It doesn&#039;t stop there either with the cutey artwork. There&#039;s the way that Tsukiko moves and way she eats that are formulated from the extra gags. Among other moments, there&#039;s the tsundere-like behavior of Azusa where she flatly denies what&#039;s really on her mind. Speaking of which, Azusa herself also shows her love of animals. Whether you&#039;re an animal lover or not, the show goes to portray many analogies. A clear example is Tsukiko likeness of a cat while Azusa seems to be fond of dogs. Naturally, the two sides don&#039;t get along just like the two girls. And naturally, Youto is the center of the drama when it comes to the duo.<br />
<br />
Despite the series having many comedy moments, there is also some serious times when we see that characters are more troubled than what they seem to be. Azusa is one of those characters especially with her past and Youto does his best to help her out. Then, there&#039;s also the tensions between the two sisters that balances between silliness and moody at various circumstances. It&#039;s hard to take them serious but at the same time, it&#039;s clear that there&#039;s something deeper going on between them.<br />
<br />
Even though the series is cute, there&#039;s many overused themes of a typical romantic comedy in Henneko that might turn some viewers off. There&#039;s plenty of fan service like the traditional beach episode. In fact, because the school has a pool, it&#039;s natural that the girls will be in their swimsuits. Therefore, expect some of those gratuitous outfits to hit the screen some time here and there. Among other little gags in the series are the various misunderstandings. In one fact, among one of these misunderstandings turns into more of a serious admiration for the Steel King. Furthermore, the Steel King is portrayed as the sex symbol of the show with her well developed body (thanks to her status as president of the track team) and sexy moans during exercises. It turns the physical education class into a theme of fan service and one that is presented clearly with both the vocals and visuals. It doesn&#039;t stop there either as we also have the master/servant like relationship, the repetitive tsundere-like behavior of Azusa, and later on seemingly a harem being under construction by our hentai prince.<br />
<br />
For J.C. Staff production, this series makes usage of its more colorful atmosphere. The way artwork is enforced throughout the series brings out the fairy tale-like cuteness of most of the characters. It is not realistic but rather overly flows with cuteness and moe. Given the setting of the romantic comedy genre, it does fit the overall idea. I&#039;m not sure what the objective it&#039;s trying to achieve but if cuteness was one of them, it nailed it on the spot. At other times though, it tries way too hard and the characters&#039; designs are generic. The petite figure, the flat chest, and the well developed bodies for our three main female characters shapes the different sides of this anime. There&#039;s nothing unique to see here but it&#039;s kawaii.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series clearly is lighthearted. It also seems that a lot of times, it puts more effort into each and every single tiny moment to bring out the cute factors. These can also turn into more lewd moments such as our Steel King and her erotic moans. It does match though with our small cast of main characters and the way they portray is also expressed in their voice actors/actresses. The softness of Tsukiko&#039;s voice is a more prominent example as we can clearly see that she lost most of her emotions. Finally, both the OP and ED songs of this series brings out cuteness and moe at its best. The way the OP song is overflowed with adorable moments and gif worthy material. The ED song fits with the same flow with the dancing moments of Tsukiko and her adorable outfits. It&#039;s needless to say that in terms of audio features, Henneko brings out &#039;cuteness&#039; at its best.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the end game of this series is how you might decide to watch Henneko. If cuteness is something you&#039;re looking for to brighten up that moody day you just had, then this series is definitely something to hit the play button on. Otherwise, enjoyment can come in different shapes and sizes. For one thing though, the series itself is hard to take serious even with its more moody moments. The fan service and little fun gags can give different results depending on how you view them. Otherwise, Henneko is a series that is probably not a masterpiece for me. I might forget it in the future. However, those cuteness and adorable moments are hard to take my eyes off of.

    For an anime with such an evocative title, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is actually a fairly...acceptably clean slice-of-life comedy with some really, really bizarre plot twists and characters. A harem-type anime, HenNeko tries to break the archetype by just being extremely weird, but still keeping comedy and romance at a harem-type best. While it may be a bit overly &quot;fuwa fuwa&quot; in both art and character design, Hentai Ouji delivers a compelling and hilarious story of a misunderstood high-school boy and his series of mishaps with the girls around him, all controlled by a mysterious cat statue. Definitely a good anime.<br />

The story is definitely Hentai Ouji&#039;s unique point. The Warawanai Neko acts as the wildcard of the anime, allowing the plot of the anime to justify extending infinitely in any direction. Basically, since the Warawanai Neko can grant any wish at a cost (think Tsubasa Chronicles), anything is game and the world can be destroyed at the whim of the characters. Of course, the foundation of the plot is still the whole &quot;high-school-boy-with-a-bunch-of-girls-in-love-with-him&quot;, but that&#039;s what a harem-type anime is and, frankly, it never gets old. As long as there&#039;s enough variation and excitement to distinguish the story, which author Sou Sagara did admirably. Anime, manga, and light novel are all consistent with regards to storyline, which is fantastic. Only grievance? The plot gets pretty wild at times, so the story gets somewhat difficult to follow.<br />
<br />
Round, chubby, cute and fluffy. Four words to describe this anime&#039;s art style. Just look at the OP - the artists were clearly trying to give people heart attacks. Naturally, not everyone likes this kind of art style. I will agree, sometimes an anime too based in this kind of cuteness becomes hard to watch (I&#039;m sorry, K-On!). But the art is good - you can&#039;t deny that. It&#039;s really encouraging to see an anime where the artists were clearly given ample time to draw, design, and really give the characters life. <br />
<br />
The music fits with the art style, but it takes the puffiness to another level. Lots of bells, tinkles, and chimes. Half of the OST seems to be played on the xylophone. Creates a great mood, but the theme limits the songs to be just &quot;cute&quot; pieces instead of timeless tunes.<br />
<br />
The characters in Hentai Ouji are full of various controversies. They are...quite stereotypical. The perverted high schoolboy. The silent Nagato-type. The tsundere. The yandere. The little sister. Classic tried and true roles, yes, but almost no effort given to move the characters even a bit out of their roles. The perveted main character, especially, while not often used, is a difficult character role to pull of because of the divided mixed reactions it usually receives - either people love it or hate it. And its still a commonly-used mold. The only character that seems to be a bit unique is Ponta - it&#039;s been a while since a side-character&#039;s given up hedonism for world peace.<br />
<br />
BUT.<br />
<br />
They are so well developed, it&#039;s hard not to love them. Despite their actions being predictable, despite their words being overused, despite the fact that you could probably guess every next move in the entire anime, the characters are developed in such a way that you really appreciate them in all their cliche-ness. I particularly like the amount of work and detail they put into Asuna&#039;s character - she&#039;s beyond the normal tsundere and in a class of her own.<br />
<br />
Whether laughing at Yokodera&#039;s antics or empathizing with Tsukiko&#039;s issues, the anime is quite able to bring the story alive and deliver it in an enjoyable package. The anime moves at a rapid pace - 4 episodes managed to knock out the entire first volume of the series. This change of pace is well-needed, and its refreshing to see Yokodera completing routes so quickly. The ending was one of the best conclusions to a 12-episode anime I have ever seen, nicely wrapping up the plotline while offering a sweet and memorable scene. Any ending that can make characters seem even cooler than they already were is a great ending in my book.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10)<br />
All in all, HenNeko is a great anime to watch - funny, charming, and crazy. Would recommend this to anyone in need of some new anime to track in 2013.

    Usually, anything with the word &quot;hentai&quot; in it is instantly thrown out the window for most people, as its word association is for the most part, is towards porn, as hentai means &quot;pervert&quot; in the japanese language.  Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, or the hentai prince and stony cat in english uses that word in such a way, that it almost means nothing, in this pretty damn good rom-com.<br />
<br />
Story (8.05/10): The story of Hentai Ouji (simplifying the title), bases itself around Youto Yokodera, an open pervert, as many can guess from the title.  Through a series of circumstances involving the best friend character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132079">
        giving up his pervert ways, and Youto&#039;s own desire to be open about being perverted, as well as hearing about a wish granting cat statue thing, Youto meets a girl named Tsukiko, who attempts to also make a wish, only to find out that both of them are discontent with their new lives, and make a pact about getting back what is theirs.  <br />
<br />
Above all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come.  Personally, I have never seen a story quite like this before, and because of that, it piqued my interest.  However, it should be noted that that story only pertains to about 3 or so episodes.  <br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s plotline is split in about 3 or so arcs where it mainly focuses on 3 of the main characters.  (The last one arguably focuses on 2 at one time.)   Each of the arcs having their own separate focus as a whole.  It&#039;s to the point that since the anime stems so far from the original idea, that the story becomes a completely different thing altogether.  However, though this sounds like a terrible thing, the story actually fits together really well, and provides a very good viewing experience.  Personally, I liked how the anime went, because I was never really bored with it at all.  <br />
<br />
Characters (8.45/10): These characters are actually pretty damn good.  First, the hentai prince, Youto Yokodera.  First of all, why is it always the perverted guy in anime, that always somehow gets the girls?  Youto is a very interesting character as his pervertedness throughout the whole series is almost non-existent.  Sure, he has porn mags, an obsession with having Tsukiko as his little sister, and above all, has perverted thoughts, but as a whole, he never seems to actually portray that too much.  Rather, he&#039;s actually a really kind and nice character.  However, he does at times act a bit denser then he should be. (as all male protagonists are)  His character does get fleshed out at the end of the series, and really provides a nice backstory for him, adding to why he&#039;s actually a pretty good character.  <br />
<br />
By the way, backstory is a huge thing that this anime does really well.<br />
<br />
Tsukiko, as the main female lead, is one of the more...interesting kuuderes in anime.  Because of her wish, she became emotionless, showing absolutely no different tone in her voice, no emotions, no embarrassed facial expression, well, you get the point.  Unlike most female characters that refuse to admit they like someone, Tsukiko...cannot.  Because she literally has no emotions at all, the denseness that Youto has when talking to her makes a lot of sense, as you really can&#039;t tell what she&#039;s actually feeling at that moment in time.  While yes, she is a good character, seeing as how she acts as Youto&#039;s voice of reason, as well as being extremely cute, they never really solve her problem in the anime, basically turning her into this emotionless doll, as they forget her whole purpose for meeting Youto as they did, and essentially, making the original idea of the story, null.  <br />
<br />
The other main characters like my personal favorite, Azusa and Tsukushi also have their part in the grand scheme of things, becoming the other 2 aforementioned main cast, and have very good fleshed out characteristics, that make their characters really good.   <br />
<br />
Various other characters, act as pretty good supporting cast, adding in more to the story, as well as fleshing out the main 4 characters more, which they excel at doing.  Above all, the characters are definitely this anime&#039;s strong suit, and it really shows it clearly.<br />
<br />
Sound and Art (7.25/10 and 7.48/10): The sound for this anime is somewhat generic I would say.  It sounds really adorable, I will give it that, and the mood fillers for the anime do sound good and very appropriate for where they&#039;re placed.  The OP and ED I would say are good but not overly fantastic.  It&#039;s nice to listen to, and the lyrics are as cute and adorable as they would come, but I wouldn&#039;t say it would be something that you would remember for a long time.  <br />
<br />
The art I would say is above average.  The art is very light colored and somewhat moe heavy, as the majority of the female cast are in fact, moe.  The characters themselves aren&#039;t too overcomplicated in terms of design, and are definitely crisp in their design as well.  It&#039;s very simplistic and very nice to look at.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (8.67/10): Hentai Ouji to Warawani neko is definitely your above-average rom-com/harem show.  (It gets a bit haremy towards the end.)  Personally, I was never bored with the series, and enjoyed watching every moment.  The comedy is pretty funny, I love the characters, and the story was plenty deep and interesting to keep me watching.  I did feel that the story felt a bit incomplete, and would&#039;ve liked to see more, but for the most part, I&#039;m happy with what I watched.  I did feel like it went a bit side-story like towards the middle; as well as losing a significant amount of its original idea as the story progressed, but it did finish itself quite nicely, and I will say that I was somewhat pleased on how the characters, and everything else turned out in the end.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a rom-com/harem/ecchi (there&#039;s not that much) show; or anyone that enjoys a good drama.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 7.89/10.  <br />
<br />
Still hoping for a second season so we could fix Tsukiko.  It sorta pissed me off seeing that she was never fixed.

    At first I was extremely tentative to start watching this show, expecting mindless fanservice, a half-arsed plot and a full baking tray of cookie cut characters. But I&#039;m pleasantly surprised with what I&#039;ve seen in the first 5 episodes. <br />
<br />
By far the best feature of the show is the comedy. The extreme bluntness of the main characters speeches have me laughing my ass off in the first couple of episodes. &quot;So I offered up my dutch wife and all my lust disappeared like I&#039;d just had a fantastic fap!&quot; <br />
<br />
 The character interactions are incredibly interesting for an anime of this genre. They each have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97077">
        there own unique characteristics that really help differentiate this from just another school harem. From the violent but gullible Tsukushi, to the emotionless, unreactive Tsukiko and the fantastic rants from Youto. <br />
<br />
On a side note I think this show may be trying for the award of &quot;most unpronounceable character name of all time&quot; With &quot;Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko&quot; (Try saying that 5 times).<br />
<br />
On the downside, while the fanservice isn&#039;t excessive it is still prevalent in the series, particularly in the very moe openings and endings (though this may be a plus for many). There are also several very generic plot scenarios in the series, such as the old &quot;walking in while she&#039;s changing/washing bit&quot;. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack isn&#039;t mindbogglingly good, but there are a few catchy tunes buried in there. <br />
<br />
In summary the show has started strong mainly due to its strong character relationships and hilarious comedy (at least to me anyway) the series looks set to become my &#039;guilty pleasure&#039; of this season, I&#039;m hoping it stays this good for the full series and doesn&#039;t try and become more serious and through away the comedy aspect. <br />

    Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko<br />
HenNeko is a comedy with bits of romantic elements that fails to bring the most of it by how confusing and fast paced the things goes.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is weak, and you will find yourself to say WTF is this, i don&#039;t understand, and for the most part the story is silly and fails to be interesting, where you can see the plotholes and get confused and it bothered me that the cat statue could grant every single wish like if he was a god and can do even the imposible i mean the statue was made from two normal girls with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195132">
        no special powers whatsoever but until the last 2 episodes the things starts to be interesting in some way.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound<br />
Art was not that amazing, i have seen better but it wasn&#039;t bad, it was good. The sound was saved by the voice acting, you will recognize and like the voice acting, and you will find the OP and the ED good, the background music was meh.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The only character that i liked the most was Tsukiko, she was adorable and i like that kind of soft vocals, she likes to eat a lot and i always found her interesting and i wanted to know why she didn&#039;t wanted to show her emotions. Youto was good but at first i found him like a little douche, because i thought that everytime he promise something he forgets it and just say the things to make others feel good, but you find out till the end why he forget things and it&#039;s a little sad knowing that. Tsukushi was funny and Azuki was fine.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
What i enjoyed from this was Tsukiko and her sister and the funny pervert parts and the VA, good enjoyment.

    Pretty odd show with less than memorable service.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll start off by saying that I didn&#039;t like how this show was presented. While re-watching Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko I  felt like the producers were adding too many elements to the story at once. One moment I&#039;m hearing about the stony cat, next moment they&#039;re talking about losing facades, expressions etc. It&#039;s like, I felt that it would&#039;ve  been better if they let the story plot and events unfold one at a time rather than all at once because it felt like a mess. <br />
<br />
(as much as I wanted to like them) hated the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214700">
        characters.  Generic, archetypes, expressionless character with lame over used &quot;sad&quot; or depressing backstory,  more than annoying &quot;Rich-ish&quot; Tsundere, and lastly pure vanilla, plain perverted MC you see in every other harem, romance, comedy. It&#039;s like at first I though if I gave them more time then I would open up to them and find at least one of the main characters funny, or at the  very least cute however, to my dismay, I could not. <br />
<br />
I seriously considered dropping this show after episode 5 because that is the  episode where I lost all interest however as a upcoming reviewer along with personal reasons its&#039; sort of a &quot;No-No&quot; to drop a show<br />
unless they are longer than 30-40 episodes. It really bothered me, or dare I say &quot;annoyed&quot; me that I couldn&#039;t find any redeeming qualities about  hentai prince and the stony cat. Characters, music, comedy, etc, none of it could really make up for the atrocity that I had been watching.<br />
Speaking of characters again, character designs were pretty interesting. When I&#039;m looking at characters in anime I always try and point out what makes them different or unique. Sometimes it&#039;s the facial expressions, other times it&#039;s personalities, in Henneko&#039;s case it was the characters eyes. Boobs didn&#039;t stand out, panties didn&#039;t stand out, they eyes did. I found that most of the characters eyes sort of reflect their personalities. For example, Tsukiko or whatever her name was, her eyes are a dull blue which reflects and in my opinion complements her personality.... boring, expressionless personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ughh, now for my least favorite thing about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.... the intro or opening song.. It was perhaps the most cringe-worthy and annoying-est song I&#039;ve heard in a while. I mean, it&#039;s great that its&#039; one of those intros that pretty much give you an idea about what the show is about however the actually song is just ewww! Honestly I cannot think of a single person to recommend this show to. Like it tries to be cute, tries to be a bit erotic and it just does not work. From a comedic standpoint though, it does have it&#039;s moments of laughter, however for me it&#039;s simply not enough. It doesn&#039;t make up for the rest of the terrible crap it gave to me. Overall I had to give this how a 5/10 because I just wasn&#039;t impressed with what I had just re-watched.

    It&#039;s doesn&#039;t matter how the sound is, or the quality is in an anime. What matters is how the anime impacted on the viewers. How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.<br />
<br />
I hope my review will pique your interest. I won&#039;t say any spoilers.<br />
<br />
Your common romcom, as so I thought. There is a love triangle involved, but it didn&#039;t seem like it focused much on the love. After a few episode, it seems like your common love triangle. But you know what? It&#039;s a very good romcom. I thought why stop halfway, so I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103215">
        finished it. If you watch a few episodes in the series, you already know who the it is, and that&#039;s as common as it gets honestly. But the point was it surprised me so much. I didn&#039;t expect any of this to happen. The twist and turn of events made it really, really, really enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Summary(little more in-depth):<br />
Yoto Yokodera, your normal pervert. Who has a problem of not showing his real emotions.  Hearing the big change and rumor of the &quot; stony cat &quot; from his equally perverted best friend. He went to see if the rumors were true. On his way, he met Tsukiko Tsusukakushi. She wanted to be more of an adult and wanted the opposite of what Yokodera wanted. The wish can remove a personality trait from someone that doesn&#039;t want it. and gives that trait to someone who needs it. Thus Yokodera found the person who has his trait. Azusa Azuki, the most attractive girl that every boy confesses to. Through the adventures of the love triangle comes of only wishes from the &quot;stony cat&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Yoko Yokodera, the main protagonist. You already know. He&#039;s your pervert who actually meant more than what he portrays. He cannot express himself truly because his kind of actions are always misunderstood. As it said in the summary he made a wish to the &quot;stony cat&quot; but in exchange for that wish, he offered his belt. But realizes soon after that his inner thoughts causes too much problems, because he can&#039;t conceal his perverted thoughts. Though his inner thoughts can also be a sweet trait.<br />
<br />
Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, which is Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi younger sister. Who happens to be Yokodera&#039;s track and field club president. Her wish to the &quot;stony cat&quot; was to not show her emotions, because she was a crybaby to her sister. In return, she offered her meat bun. Being unable to express any emotions. She still enjoys time with Yokodera. Even though her emotions doesn&#039;t show. There is more to her then the wish she made.<br />
<br />
Azusa Azuki, Popular, turned down all the boys that confessed there love for her. and is the one that has Yokodera&#039;s trait. So she can hide her emotions easily. How they met was through Yokodera&#039;s action in front of a large crowd. Though she might be your kind of popular girl. There are usually always something more to them in romcoms.<br />
<br />
Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi, I just felt that I had to add her to this review. Since she does play a big part in the series. She&#039;s your president of the track and field club. Though she might seem like a despicable person. She actually means more than what you would think (She&#039;s pretty funny by the way).<br />
<br />
Overall, I really like this anime. Like I said on my 2nd paragraph. It doesn&#039;t focus too much on the love triangle. I think it really shows that you have to understand each other as friends. What happens in the past stays in the past. You can&#039;t dwell in it forever, or change it. You just have to make it work in the present.

    This anime was on my plan-to-watch list for a long time and just recently picked it up to have a go. Boy was I in for a surprise, it turned how to be very good and was unexpected of the entertainment value I receive. How awesome would it be to have a Cat God grant any wish of your desire, but does it come with a cost?<br />
<br />
Story-8<br />
The story centers aroud Youto Yokodera who is rather an &quot;average joe&quot; highschool student. Due to his perverted nature, his actions are always being misunderstood thus having a problem of expressing inner self. After hearing a story from a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148527">
        childhood friend he goes to the Cat God statue where it is said it can grant any wish but as a twist of events, there is a give and take consequence which is the downside to it. His wish was to make it impossible for him to lie to help out with his personal problem of expressing himself for a belt of a hug pillow he offered in exchange, the twist to that was he lost his facade about his perverted nature. He later realizes that this has made him painfully honest to others which has caused trouble for others and embarrassment for himself so he then teams up with his childhood friend in Tsukiko who lost her emotions due to her experience of the Cat God Statue, and they are on a mission to reverse their wishes.I also  like how unique and entertaining this anime can get with some of the most hilarious comedy scenes that you will see i assure you the story is fun simple and enjoyable <br />
<br />
Characters-8<br />
About the characters you have Youto Yokodera that has a  perverted nature but besides he is a nice and reliable person that sometimes tries to use his &#039;facade&#039; to trick the other girls you also got Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi she is the tsundere type and that makes her very likeable the other characters are love interests to the main character.<br />
<br />
Art-7<br />
In saying that, the animation was very fluid and maintained a good quality throughout<br />
<br />
Sound-7<br />
After you get past the opening you are all good the OST are pretty good didin&#039;t find one that piqued my interest though <br />
<br />
Overall-8<br />
I really love and enjoy the story characters even the art well about the sound like i said nothing that you can remember &#039;avarage&#039;&#039; but that opening oh god maybe its just me but i really find it annoying after the end i demand a second season <br />

    Let&#039;s get to the point - you are watching this because you like moe.  There simply is no other reason for anyone to watch it.  The story is barely coherent and the plot twists are more like back flips induced by characters to maintain a harem, create an opportunity for hit and miss comedy and create an explosion, LITERALLY AN EXPLOSION, of moe.<br />
<br />
Since we now know why you are watching let&#039;s get to the good, the bad and the moe.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10<br />
There is no story, or not at least one meant for any decent inspiration or contemplation.  It exists only so that there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102453">
        are ways for moe to be exploited like a gold mine from the girls.  Which is why I won&#039;t mention the characters as you can guess that there also just for moe and harem antics, no development you haven&#039;t seen or even care to see.  Of all the LN adaptations in the Spring of 2013, none have as badly cobbled together a piece of plot as it (even the awful Oreimo S2). Clearly a bad, but not a con because who watches moe for story.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
The man behind the art of the series is a genius, well known in Japan for how f****** adorable he makes anime and manga girls.  Those sparkly eyes, beautiful slender bodies and triangular faces are the thing of legend.  The animation is the stock of JC&#039;s B team and not worthy of much mention other than thank god it&#039;s not like Aku no Hana.  It&#039;s average at best.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
I could listen to both the ED and OP on loop for an age and still feel the buzz of moe, it&#039;s that irritatingly good.  Surely everyone (even guys) have sung Carly Rae Jepsen&#039;s &#039;Call me maybe&#039; and just as that is stuck in our heads so is HenNeko&#039;s songs.  But that alone would not garner a 10/10.  What did though is the shocking moe, made for the role, brilliant voice acting of all our leading ladies.  My personal favourite is Ishihara Kaori&#039;s Azuki Azusa.  The other great thing is that Kaiji Yuki is not Kaiji Yuki from Guilty Crown and thus not an annoying youth who shouts garbage like a dump truck.  He talks more like a regular human and thus cannot annoy people off.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
I hate K-ON, I hate Oreimo, I hate effectively every single moe blob show of the last 4 years but I like HenNeko. I haven&#039;t converted or anything but the sound and art so damn moe that I am enticed like a drunk virgin to a beautiful prostitute.  I just can&#039;t help it.  I don&#039;t get annoyed the same way as though shows because I have accepted the purpose of the show is to ultimately wet my pants and buy some BDs (which I will).<br />
<br />
Overall 6/10<br />
If I love it so much how can I rate it just a 6?  Because I realize that as an anime its crap but its crap that somehow I love.  Plenty of other people who have not been seduced will know its crap and its better they do.  But as I have explained its crap that I don&#039;t mind smearing my face with.

    HenNeko is a comedy/romance/drama put in order with the former genre being the most prevalent. It&#039;s something that you may want to watch to pass time or just for something lighthearted and funny, but under examination this show is lacking and has its own list of flaws and problems.<br />
<br />
The show follows the generic romance formula (which is not necessarily bad) where a boy meets a girl, or girls, and through experiences that they share romance starts to develop. The show takes upon the perspective of Yokodera Youto as he develops relationships with the people around him. The interesting twist with this show is that there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121409">
        are &quot;cat gods&quot; that will grant wishes, but never directly in the way that  the wisher wants.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
Premise and outline: I found that the premise of the story to be rather well done, especially during the later episodes. The premise provides enough for interesting character interactions, development and can captivate the watcher. The potential for drama, romance, and mystery are all there and the way the story ends up flowing is quite well.<br />
<br />
Execution: Very, very poor. The execution of this anime is what ultimately dropped this show from a potential 8 to a lacking 4 (See my profile for my rating guide). The following is a dissection of the execution.<br />
<br />
Drama vs. comedy - The show started off being very lighthearted, unrealistic and for good reason: to be funny. However, starting off a show with such extreme quirky defining characteristics to be entertaining, which it succeeded at, later hurts what the show tried to do later. The final arc within the show ended up being something that was meant to be emotional, touching, and as a way for characters to develop. However, because of the way the show started off, I couldn&#039;t take the characters seriously enough to care about their problems when presented in a more serious light. However, to not only present the bad points of the show, the final arc was very interesting and would be excellent if the characters were presented to be more realistically eccentric instead of absurdly goofy(or dumb, in the case of Tsukushi) for the sake of comedy at the start of the show.<br />
<br />
Setup of plot - Instead of drama occurring because of events within the character&#039;s lives, it ends up being too dependent on the cat gods as a plot device. A character will wish for something without thinking too hard of it, and it will end up going bad in one way or another. Because of this, if you examine the plot carefully, you realize it&#039;s written rather poorly that everything only happens because of the convenient cat statues that allow you to defy reason. What makes it worse is that the wishes can be simply reverted if you want; this makes it so all the dramatic issues caused by the show can simply be resolved by a deus ex machina of sorts, where you just cancel the issue by saying &quot;I want to cancel my wish&quot;.<br />
<br />
Plot holes - I will not explain what they are in order to stay true to a spoiler-free review, but let it be known that they are abundant and noticeable. In addition, not only are some of the plot holes just unexplained issues, there are some that are contradictions to the information presented to us. If you want to read a list of the ones I found (spoilers obviously) you can find them here http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=695701<br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
As previously stated, the characters are rather eccentric to extreme levels for comedic effect. However, this does not make them bad, only hard to take seriously during the more serious final arc.<br />
<br />
Youto - The main character is well done and a strong point for the show. For the lead male in a harem anime, he is not your typical idiot who is oblivious to the feelings of people around him. He is perceptive and is intelligent enough to deduct the situation at hand and understand what&#039;s going around him. <br />
<br />
Tsutsukakushi sisters: Nothing special to note. Decent characters who undergo some development as the show progresses.<br />
<br />
Azusa Azuki: As a character in general, she is unique and not a stereotypical character trope. However, she feels somewhat irrelevant in the later story for a main character. Her attraction towards the main character is also somewhat irrational.<br />
<br />
-Sound and Art-<br />
I never let sound and art affect what I rate a show, but I will comment on it. The art is great and the music is nothing special.<br />
<br />
-Other thoughts-<br />
This anime has a lot of moe elements with it and is somewhat ecchi. I have a neutral opinion on moe in general but I feel that it is bad when it&#039;s too abundant. The OP and ED felt like JC Staff was cramming moe into the viewers which I wasn&#039;t particularly fond of. Personally, I think moe and ecchi are a bad mix together as they kind of contradict each other but to each their own.<br />

    Have you ever seen an anime with extremely strong characters but a really weak plot?<br />
<br />
Quite a contrast, isn&#039;t it? I&#039;ve seen plenty of anime with a decent plot line but really weak characters, but this is the first time I&#039;ve ever seen a flip-flop like this. And perhaps you also agree, if you&#039;ve already watched this show.<br />
<br />
Enter the main characters: first up, Youto Yokodera. A pervert by nature, Youto is basically every high school boy: he will do anything in his power to see girls...... well you get the point. Next up, Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi (say that five times fast). Tsukiko is an emotionless, monotonous girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203458">
        who likes to eat food (who doesn&#039;t?). Third: Azusa Azuki, a strong-headed girl with a lot of willpower - it&#039;s either her way or no way. Finally, Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi (what is up with these names lol), Youto&#039;s track captain, and as you&#039;ll see later in the anime, an extremely important figure during Youto&#039;s younger childhood years.<br />
<br />
A simple, small cast of main characters with a lot of potential - which this anime fortunately delivers.<br />
<br />
Every main character undergoes significant development. If you watch closely, you&#039;ll learn why Youto can&#039;t remember anything from his childhood; why Tsukiko acts the way she does and why she was willing to sacrifice her emotions for another significant person in her life; why Azusa behaves the way she does and how it&#039;s basically Youto&#039;s fault; and, finally, how Tsukushi&#039;s life forever changed when she met Youto.<br />
<br />
If the character development is what allows this anime to take five steps forward, the plot is what makes it take five steps back.<br />
<br />
The plot is absolutely haywire. My main problem with this anime is the use of the &quot;Cat God.&quot; Need a reason to push the plot forward? Cat God to the rescue! Want to create tension among the characters for some trivial reason? Cat God to the rescue! Want to successfully pull off a deus ex machina? Cat God to the rescue! Too many times does this show treat the Cat God as a gimmick, and for that, it fails on the plot.<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll also see how many of the side characters fall out the plot after one particular scene. To many people, this seems fine - after all, the story doesn&#039;t center around the side characters; but particularly take note of how they exit, ESPECIALLY Morii and Moriya.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, however, this show was very enjoyable. It was comedic, light-hearted, and funny. Characters were all drawn with thick lines; voice acting and sound were decent. All put aside, this is definitely a show worth watching if you&#039;re trying to kill off a lazy Sunday afternoon.<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
Art: 7<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Character: 9<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Overall: 5<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Impressive character development<br />
- Comedic, light-hearted<br />
- Art is on point<br />
Cons:<br />
- Too many plot inconsistencies<br />
- Too many plot holes<br />
- Side characters exited out of the show unexpectedly - and this was done in  a poor fashion.

    Boy this anime is strange. In many ways.<br />
<br />
First off it started like any normal anime these days: with a perverted male going on and on about swimsuits and what not. Then it turned into semi-magical anime where a cat statue grants wishes. Then it become a semi-love story with lot of harem. Then it went back to the cat statue that grants wishes, only this time everyone could use it. Then it became a mess of sorts and I got totally confused by the episode. And then it turned into a full-blown sad story through the cat statue where they go into the past to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181758">
        uncover the mysteries of the present. And when they return, its back to the harem non-sense.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, it feels like Yami did a mind crush on me. This anime is more random than a random generator. But for all its non-sense, its not a bad anime. I liked it. But I have to say that the last 3-4 episodes were kind of pointless. Its like the author suddenly thought that this anime isn&#039;t serious enough, so let&#039;s fill it with serious content. Why? Wouldn&#039;t it have been easier for the girl to just say &quot;okay I&#039;m not your first&quot;?<br />
<br />
I recommend it, but you will have to decide on its genre because its fuck all.

    At first, I thought this anime was an ordinary ecchi anime, which showed a boring story, putting ecchi art like any other anime. as with just looking at the title &quot;hentai&quot;. however, still can not judge just by its cover. after watching it to completion, the story is incredible.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the episode, the story begins with a silly and outspoken main character. then began to emerge an interesting path like the power of a cat statue, and how the personality can move on to others. and of course I did not expect it.<br />
then the story began to continue how the power of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272438">
        cat was indeed influential and really work. it is very interesting and of course that makes the audience feel something else in the anime ecchi genre. so of course for me that is a new thing.<br />
especially when the story continues at the climax. where the main character goes to the past to understand what really happened. it&#039;s really impressive how the author created many paths that made me and possibly other audiences amazed. the ending was also satisfying, making the audience happy because there is no odd and disappointing decisions. really this anime is unique and great.<br />
<br />
about music, I can not say much because it is an anime is different story. as is not expected from anime with this kind of genre. but also quite interesting where the background music can make the moment more tense or boring.<br />
<br />
about the characters, quite impressive because the author really creates a character without emotion. such as how they feel sad, happy, scared, embarrassed, yet still show a flat and innocent expression.<br />
and about other characters are also quite fun how they try to make this anime stay alive and not feel weird. such as interspersed with a lot of humor, sadness, and of course the ecchi itself.<br />
<br />
about art is pretty good. how the character designer can make a fixed figure put up a flat face while feeling different things. but basically, everything is very nice and amazing. good work, JCS.<br />
<br />
My recommendation, if you are looking for anime different from anime humor, ecchi, and romance usually, this anime is very worthy for you to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, a good anime.

    Hey there, muchachos! Time to make my review, so:<br />
<br />
mou ikkai kotchi muite iitai koto ga motto aru kara <br />
mou ikkai kotchi muite honki ga yureru ai no future <br />
dakara kotchi muite maware chikyuu koi o nosete <br />
dakara kotchi muite guuzen ja nai FantaFuture! <br />
<br />
Enough of that before them mod thinkof my review as a troll, so, no more BS, here are my ratings for each this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
Story- good 7<br />
<br />
I like the plot where it involves this stony cat that has the capacity to grant any wishes and this is where the proverb &quot;Be careful of what you wish for or you might just get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104401">
        it&quot; kind of thing, were we find the characters making such wishes only to regret what they have done. I only limit to to such score co&#039;z the story depends on the said proverb. <br />
<br />
Art- fair 6.<br />
<br />
There maybe some fanservice that them dogs would howl for by, it was nice that there isn&#039;t such intense nudity involved especially when it come to Tsukushi&#039;s tits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound- good 7.<br />
<br />
The score is for the op and ed, as for Youto&#039;s VA, I would have prefer if would have been done by  Soichiro Hoshi since his perverted tone from &quot;Sora No Othoshimono&quot; would have been perfect,instead of  Yuki Kaji whose voice is too immature for the said character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character- very good 8.<br />
<br />
The score is for Tsukiko and Azusa since it was these two who contributed to this anime&#039;s touching drama, as for Youto, well he&#039;s not bad to be this anime&#039;s clown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- very good 8.<br />
<br />
I like that this anime can shift from comedy to drama, most especially the last 2 episodes of this anime, where it was a Tsukiko and Youto arc.<br />
<br />
Overall-  fair 6.<br />
<br />
Ok, so it was a funny and touching anime and the title fit well to this anime&#039;s theme, I gave it a 6 for the overall since it ended in a double standard at one hand we have Youto confessing and kissing Azusa and on the other hand we see him doing the same with Tsukiko, what pisses me off was how studio J.C Staff decided to end this anime that is like eating something nice only to spit it out, but that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adios, muchachos.

    This anime&#039;s strength lies it&#039;s &#039;laugh out loud&#039; comedic inane story, without any deeper meaning behind it. <br />
<br />
This is one those animes which are made for pure entertainment, comedy, with no real intention of aspiring to become a memorable anime and crudely follows a shadowy outline of a story.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s just say it&#039;s an anime that doesn&#039;t take itself seriously.<br />
<br />
Though the anime wasn&#039;t a disaster, the episodes after the 6th one probably lost my interest in terms of story; there didn&#039;t seem to be a solid plot development. The anime&#039;s plot did not live up to the seemingly large expectations that was foreshadowed by the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101535">
        episode the narrator (MC) says &quot;We went there underestimating it&#039;s power...&quot; Though the anime did have some fantasical links within the first episode, it seemed to be dominated by realism, which is why it was a huge &#039;shocker&#039; when it became almost completely fantasy;time travel, reality distortion etc (on the 7 - 10th episode) it seemed to completely change it&#039;s calm realistic setting into a completely nonsensical mutable world.<br />
<br />
 At the time of writing (ep. 10), the plot seemed unmethodical; without aim. Other animes of similar nature, Hayate no Gotuku, through all it&#039;s hilarity, aims to connect to some kind of story. But this anime has no such connection, it merely races through the entire anime, and ironically, becomes somewhat of a harem of little girls, and attempts to make a connection with it&#039;s poorly written  story at the end of the anime. Though there seemed to be alot of foreshadowing to the anime&#039;s story, the story fails to tie all the knots together in a nice fashion. That being said, the anime had not finished at this point.<br />
<br />
As an aside from the 2 large paragraphs about the storyline, I&#039;m going to attempt to lump art, sound, character all into 1 paragraph. Starting off with character, the oversimplified nature of the character development seems to take a sporadic turn due to inherent &#039;superpowers&#039; that is embedded in the story, the character&#039;s personalities switch around so much that it is impossible to see what each character&#039;s true purpose is in within the anime, or to be more specific what each character truly are; in that we don&#039;t specifically know them well enough before they switch to a completely new persona. Sound, the only world to describe it is &#039;fluffy&#039; or rather &#039;cute&#039; the anime resolves heavily on the cuteness of their heroines in order to lure unsuspecting lolicons into watching the anime. But the sounds of the cicadas, water, background characters etc is something that is around the level that would be appropriate for anime of this generation; average. Lastly art, the art style is generic, and that&#039;s probably all that is needed to be said. <br />
<br />
But despite all it&#039;s flaws, I really enjoyed the anime, even though I heavily criticise the anime. My enjoyment was 10/10, it had me falling off my chair in laughter, and happily face palming at certain moments in the story due to it&#039;s utter (stupidly); stupid funny at times. So without doing any mathematical calculations, the score I give, overall, is 7.

    To start off, the plot really got to me in the beginning. The cat who grants wishes, the girl who loses her expression, and the perverted boy who doesn&#039;t have memory of his past! I was sure it would keep me so hooked that I might finish this anime in a day!! But it wasn&#039;t like that. It took me atleast 3 days to complete this short anime. Suffice to say, what was promising in the beginning seemed kind of dull midway. It had its moment of laughter but then the story drags on. The only thing which I thought this anime had its weight

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163289">
        was during the last episodes. I am not gonna spoil it, but yeah, the last episodes were really good. Heartfelt stuff. Too many feels. In my opinion, this anime had good stuff only during the beginning eps 1-3, and the last episodes. The inbetweens were sorta meh.

Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is an anime that is often judged earlier for it&#039;s title, though it&#039;s more misunderstood. This anime does not have any hentai in it at all, and the fan service is more tame than others. But what really makes this anime stand out from others, is the writing and characters.<br />
<br />
Story (7) - The story isn&#039;t outstanding unfortunately. It does have it&#039;s sad and happy moments, but nothing strikes off as memorable. In a nutshell, it revolves around the main protagonists wishing towards the Cat God (hence the Stony Cat in the title), but wishes will always come at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196666">
        a cost. Though I have always been wondering myself that if they would have worded the wish a bit differently, that there would really be any disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Art (8) - The art isn&#039;t the greatest either, but it just fits and doesn&#039;t really do anything wrong. I don&#039;t really have anything else to say here. It&#039;s definitely not a work of art, but it&#039;s just good.<br />
<br />
Sound (7) - The voice actors aren&#039;t necessarily bad, but I really disliked Youto&#039;s voice in the first episode. And while I absolutely adore Tsukiko, it is undeniable that she had the easiest voicing role in like... ever. Tsukiko has a monotone voice (which you understand when you watch the anime), which doesn&#039;t change throughout the entire anime. The rest of the voice actors are okay, but nothing spectecular. While the opening and ending themes are, of course, personal preferences, I really liked them!<br />
<br />
Character (9) - I&#039;m mainly going to focus on the two main characters from this anime: Youto and Tsukiko. While the others are good too, these two are what the anime revolves around the most.<br />
<br />
Youto - I like him because he strays away from the typical Harem King theme. Instead of being the cat, he is often the mouse. While he is a pervert, his actions barely come to life and he often doesn&#039;t want to get involved with them either. That&#039;s why I like him more over the regular Harem Kings.<br />
<br />
Tsukiko - Everybody&#039;s favorite, and definitely mine too. Tsukiko is not only a very cute character, but also the main cause for the earlier mentioned happy and sad moments. The biggest reason I probably like her is that we are pretty similar, but in reverse. While she has emotions, I don&#039;t have many. While she can&#039;t express them, I have no trouble with it. And both of us talk in a pretty monotone voice.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9) - One of it&#039;s genres is Comedy, so there&#039;s bound to be some enjoyment here. And there is. This is mainly due to the writing, which is genius. Youto is a pervert after all, and they all react to it in a different way. And it does help that Tsukiko is the regular &#039;Black Hole Belly&#039; stereotype of the anime. She can eat a lot, and those are often funny scenes to watch as she keeps talking in a monotone voice while eating so much.<br />
<br />
Overall (8) - Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is an anime with a missunderstood name. The story isn&#039;t anything special, but the characters and writing more than make up for it. If you&#039;re interested in something fresh that strays away from most of the clichés other Harem anime have, give it a go!

    Hentai Ouji is JC Staffs moe flavor of the season.<br />
<br />
I know I know the industry is cluttered with cutesy school anime and moe girls doing moe things. But Hentai Ouji was nonetheless enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I’m actually kinda sad it is over since it reminded me a lot of one of my favorite anime, Denpa Onna.<br />
While Denpa Onna is a lot better in my opinion and also my favorite school/moe anime, Hentai Ouji still managed to be one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Despite being just a school anime, Hentai Ouji (HenNeko) actually had a story. Quite simple and more in the background but at least

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103343">
        it followed an overall theme and even had a conclusion.<br />
<br />
It’s about cat statues granting wishes and a bunch of characters wishing for the wrong things and dealing with the consequences.<br />
It wasn&#039;t really focused though. It just randomly had events going on that were somewhat connected.<br />
If you are cynical you could say the “plot” was an excuse for fanserice and moe.<br />
At least HenNeko had plenty of both to offer.<br />
<br />
So I guess I have to warn you, if you are allergic to harem, moe or fanservice you better stay as far away from this show as possible.<br />
If you on the other hand love cute things, blantaned sexualising of underaged girls and one guy going out with 4 girls at once this is probably what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the show though you will most likely be confused, as the cat statue wishes make the show pretty surreal and trippy at times.<br />
I actually thought this show is more suited for Studio Shaft (and also think they would have made it better but JC staff did an okay job) since it was not only full with fanservice but also had the quirky characters and messy story telling.<br />
<br />
On a bad note though, the drama the show offered can’t be taken too seriously in light of it’s rather light themes and sexual content.<br />
But again this is an otaku catering show not more.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Since it is a harem you have one MC, his male friend who is barely represented in the show and a bunch of girls with different quirks and personalities.<br />
<br />
Yokodera is our perverted hero, he is thick headed as all harem protagonist and can’t read the most obvious intentions of the girls around him. But he is still entertaining and somewhat cute.<br />
I just loved how blunt they just made his perverted side. He straight out says and does things other harem protagonist are merely forced into. It’s kinda more fun to watch him do perverted stuff than your typical nice guy.<br />
<br />
But yeah his character is rather simple and the development doesn’t go anywhere too far out.<br />
<br />
Tsutsukakushi, Tsukiko (say that 10 times in a row!) is the other main character of the show, and probably the most important of the girls. She wishes right from the start to lose her emotions(actually more her emotional expression) and thus turns into a sorta Dandere character.<br />
She is damn cute and her voice is just melting you. Despite her supposed emotionless character she is witty with her comments and has some of the funniest moments of the show. She is also damn cute if I haven’t mentioned it.<br />
Have I meantioned that she is damn cute? No?<br />
Well she is... damn cute.<br />
<br />
Azuki is her main rival, though also cute she gets less screentime and less backdrop. Her character is also less consistent. Sometimes she likes MC sometimes she doesn’t. She is not a classical tsundere in this regard just very inconsistent.<br />
<br />
Tsukushi is Tsukikos older sister. She is leader of the track team and starts out hating the MC. Her role starts out as being the dominating arch type, abusing the MC but later becomes more likable. She is also used for the Oppai Fanservice, so if you are into that stuff she already won.<br />
She is also thick as two short planks as Yokodera makes her believe he is him and his none existent little brother at the same time, she falls in love with later on.<br />
though adds a lot of comedy to the show.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters are rather insignificant but all cute too look at.<br />
<br />
Overall the show has great quirky characters but also has no depth or anything to offer. Just your typical moe archetypes, fun to look at and you wanna cuddle them, but nothing great and deep.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, JC Staff animated HenNeko and we get our usual treatment. Nothing great, nothing bad.<br />
It was interesting from the surreal point of view but nothing Shaft couldn’t have made better and thus it was a sorta “letdown”.<br />
<br />
Backgrounds were typical school settings though sprinkled with some surreal elements whenever the wishes went rampant.<br />
<br />
The character designs, simple but effective. You will love them if you love moe things, you will hate them if you hate moe things.<br />
<br />
The special effects were actually pretty decent and helped the whole magical feel of the show.<br />
<br />
Overall it’s not impressive by any means but gives you a decent dose of cuteness and good feelings.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Surprisingly well done was the soundtrack in HenNeko.<br />
<br />
The opening and endings as sweet as sugar. If you like cutesy popsongs you will like them. If you don’t... well you know the spiel.<br />
<br />
The background music was used effectively ranging from typical comedy songs to more dramatic piano pieces for the dramatic scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall the soundtrack wasn’t something I’d listen to outside of the anime but was quite good.<br />
<br />
Great were the voice actors as they not only enhanced the moe factor of the show but also were responsible for the sound effects themselves giving your extra sweet moments that you better see your doctor to check if you don’t have diabetes already.<br />
<br />
The super young Yui Ogura did the voice for Tsukiko and was my personal favorite even though Yukari Tamura did her older sister which was at least as good.<br />
If you’ve seen Katanagatari you’ll recognize Yukari, she has a great range and also a very sweet voice.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kaji lends Yokodera his voice, proving again his versatility from Eren Jäger to a Harem lead.<br />
<br />
The last great thing about the show were the sound effects.<br />
I normally don’t recognize them too much in shows but HenNeko had great ones that complimented the comedic scenes well and enhanced the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Speaking of enjoyment, Hentai Ouji was a blast for me.<br />
I know I should feel guilty for liking it as much, but I just did, sue me!<br />
<br />
I do say to anyone though that hates these kind of shows to just stay away, you are not missing out, this is a full-time pandering show with nothing to offer but good feelings.<br />
At least for me and some others this show was a good ride and soon will be replaced by the next cutesy show to come out. (and we get plenty of those...)<br />

Conclusion<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Hentai Ouji manages to be a good show in the Harem/Moe/School genre. Though it’s yet another brain dead fanservice show for Otakus.<br />
While I get my fair share of enjoyment out of it it saddens me that these kinds of shows tend to be the best ones of the season.<br />
Besides fanservice, moe and some nice ideas about wishes and how they can go wrong it couldn’t offer anything new to the industry. It’s just one cute fish in a sea of many cute fishes.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
+ very cute and moe characters<br />
+ decent production values both in art and sound<br />
<br />

    Despite the title of &quot;Hentai Prince&quot; the show is not an ecchi/fan service title and is really some strange supernaturalish romantic comedy. The show is about how the wishes granted by the Nekogami affect the characters and the world they live in.<br />
<br />
The Stony cat grants a wish in a rather particular way. For instance, the main character wants to be more open with who he is so he asks the cat to take away his facade. At the same time the cat will give what it took to someone who needs it. This along with the rather unlimited power the cat has is the basis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190996">
        of the show and how just about all the situation evolve.<br />
<br />
While the story is rather fresh at first and honestly, pretty funny. It goes out of hand during mid to late episodes with some questionable archs until the last couple of episodes which are heart warming and explains just about everything<br />
<br />
This show has the benefit of having two of the most entertaining, and rather likeable leads of the season. Youto (the hentai prince), can&#039;t really talk to people, not because of being shy, but because he, after all, is a pervert and can&#039;t express himself correctly. So he wishes that the Nekogami take away his inhibition... which causes to be problematic. Tsukiko on the other hand has always relied on her emotions. I&#039;m sure you can see where this is going. They try to help each other to regain what the cat took from them.<br />
<br />
The show is somewhat a harem so other girls are present too. Among the most notable is Azusa, who starts out as a troubled and somewhat bullied character that looks like she might get some nice development, but unfortunately gets stuck in a rather poorly done later arch along with another character. Tsukushi (Tsukiko&#039;s older sister) is somewhat more important later on in the show, but never really gets the development she&#039;s due til the end.<br />
<br />
Overall a lot of the characters do get significant development, but not always in the way that might be the best. For having such strong main characters the side ones range from completely annoying to average.<br />
<br />
In the end The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat is a show you should not pass over due to its name. It has very entertaining and endearing main characters with enough of a moe factor to keep fans watching past some of the more questionable middle parts.
