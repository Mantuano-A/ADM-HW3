    Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki, otherwise known as How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom is yet another isekai anime that focuses on politics and military aspects, with a touch of romance, and a few actions. As it is set in a period where kingdoms still exist and ongoing wars, the anime is considered medieval anime. <br />
<br />
First of all, I’m not into isekai anime in general, but I decided to binge-watch Genjitsu anyways as it has my favorite seiyuu as the main heroine. I see Inori Minase, I click. Besides that, I had a feeling that Genjitsu has the potential to be a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418311">
        anime. <br />
<br />
The story follows Kazuma Souya, a realist boy who was summoned to another world without his notice, a world where kingdoms were still present. Under certain circumstances, he was chosen as the new king of a kingdom named Elfrieden, replacing king Albert. He was told that he will be engaged to the princess, Liscia. Left with no choice, Kazuma had to bear the future of Elfrieden as the new king. At first glance, you might find Genjitsu as another generic isekai anime, which is mostly true, but once you have watched enough of it, you will find yourself enjoying it more than you should have, at least that’s the case for me. <br />
<br />
The story of Genjitsu follows a simple, straightforward yet exciting and wholesome plot, which makes it perfect if you’re a newcomer. In this anime, you will get to know the hardship, political situation, economy, and the military from decades ago. What’s more interesting is that our main character, Kazuma, who was nothing more than an average guy, was put in a tough situation where he had to rule a kingdom. To my surprise, he was a good leader that knows what he was doing for the better future of the nation. He even came up with a solution to solve the food shortage right after he was succeeded to the throne. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, as I’m the type of guy who’s into romance anime, Genjitsu has successfully served its purpose for being a romance anime. I smiled all throughout the show when a scene between Kazuya and Liscia is shown. <br />
<br />
For what it’s worth, I prefer main characters like Kazuya for me to enjoy a show to the fullest. Unlike many others, Kazuma is not an overpowered character when it comes to combat skills, but the fact that he has his own way of approach when faced with problems makes him look like a reliable guy and enjoyable to watch overall. Not only Kazuya but the other characters have also shown each of their great personas that can be appealing and charming, at least for me. Liscia, the main heroine, is a tsundere but not to an extent where she gets too annoying to watch. She’s rather cute, especially when Kazuya is being too close to another girl, that’s when her jealousy will strike. There are the other two characters that are worth mentioning, Juna and Aisha. They play an important role in making the series enjoyable after all. They are unique and funny which can make me laugh my ass off at times. Also, the way the characters interact with each other is just straight wholesome. <br />
<br />
Another thing that has left me astounded while watching the show is the soundtrack. I have to say that Jin Aketagawa did a magnificent job as the sound director of the show. The choice of soundtracks is really great and simply spot on. It felt like  It is placed in the right scenes, and it evokes different emotions depending on the situation. Soundtracks aside, I can’t help but notice some similarities between Genjitsu and Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken, where Genjitsu seems to resemble Slime in terms of sound effects. Well, it is not actually that surprising as both of the anime share the same sound director. <br />
<br />
Now, let’s talk about the voice actors. You might already know some of the names before stumbling upon the anime, as the characters were voiced by seiyuu that can be seen in some of the famous titles. The voice actor of Kazuya, Yuusuke Kobayashi, was known for voicing Subaru from Re: Zero; The voice actor of Aisha, Ikumi Hasegawa, was known for voicing Vladilena Milizé from 86; The voice actor of Liscia, the one and only, the goddess of all Inori Minase, was known for voicing Itsuki Nakano from Gotoubun. With that being said, you can expect the anime to have charming characters, as the voice actors have successfully delivered in voicing each of the characters and are just undoubtedly spot on. <br />
<br />
As for the animation, I have no complaints whatsoever, but at the same time, there is nothing special about it that’s worth mentioning. It’s not something that you can expect it to be at a degree where you feel completely amazed by it. It’s pretty reasonable if you ask me, as the anime was not aimed to be something with massive action, to begin with. Anyway, all I can say is that J.C Staff did a great job in animating the show overall. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki is one of the prime example of an isekai anime done right. It has all the things I need for me to fully enjoy an anime: wholesome plot, great romance, cute characters, outstanding voice actors, decent animation, and amazing soundtracks. I would highly recommend this anime to everyone with no exception.<br />
<br />
Genjitsu gets 9 fairies out of 10.

    It is not that great. It starts out interesting, but quickly loses steam and switches to a fairly slow-paced uneventful mode. The visuals are fairly typical and do not exactly shine, backgrounds aren&#039;t that great, however there are at least two nice voice actresses, which voice side characters. <br />
<br />
In greater details. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
The source material for this work isn&#039;t bad but isn&#039;t stellar either (I used to read it long time ago till it sort of fizzled out). There was a great potential here for some sort of conspiracy or political play, but it isn&#039;t realized because the world and characters aren&#039;t fleshed out with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409736">
        sufficient details. For example among anime there are 12 kingdoms and somali to mori which portray very detailed and very different world. There&#039;s nothing like that hre, everything&#039;s a bit simplistic and is used to show that the hero is a nice king.<br />
That isn&#039;t a whole lot of fun, and because of this at the moment Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu looks more promising than this.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10.<br />
It is thoroughly average except that backgroudns are a bit bad. There isn&#039;t a whole lot of details on character, the animation isn&#039;t stellar, but there are no awful CG graphics, aside from background, that is.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10:<br />
Voice actresses for Aicsha and Liscia seem to stand out among the rest of the cast, with Liscia being specifically convincing. That&#039;s why it gets six.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10:<br />
Characters themselves, however, aren&#039;t that great and do not get much time to show off their traits/personalitiies. Things kind roll along with the story instead.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10.<br />
I didn&#039;t quite enjoy it. The beginning was interesting, but the very next episode was significantly weaker. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10:<br />
At the moment those series do not seem to be very promisiing, and appear to be more useful for scenario when you want to kill some time and have nothing else to watch. There are some fun minor details, but it isn&#039;t amazing and it isn&#039;t a &quot;must see&quot; series. For now, at least.

    Ah, isekai. What was once a promising and delightful genre has now become the punching bag of the anime community. Riddled with memes about truck-kun, harems upon harems, stupidly overpowered perfect MCs, and ridiculously long names, it’s easy to see how this genre has become one of the stalest and over-farmed genres in all of anime.<br />
<br />
But when I first read the description for Genjitsu, I was intrigued. I’ve always been a fan of realism and reform through policy, add in my economics minor which I’m studying for uni, and you’ve got me hooked on the concept of a hero saving a world through policy reform.<br />
<br />
But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418305">
        at the back of my head, there was a voice warning me against setting my hopes high for this series. And as soon as the first episode concluded, I knew I was in for a trainwreck.<br />
<br />
Genjitsu is a horrible anime, let alone an isekai, because it is predicated on never-ending, bloated dialogue and paradoxical scenarios. Not to mention the classic harem featuring all the tropes, from loli to tsundere to elves and milf-ish baddies.<br />
<br />
Light spoilers ahead (not that you’d want to watch this series anyways).<br />
<br />
I’ve seen better story dialogue writing from 4th-grade students. Just take a look at EP 6. A convenient mouthpiece chick shows up in the tavern, coincidentally at the same time as the MC king, and proceeds to go on one of the longest exposition dumps in the series. In general, the dialogue and exposition is just so 2-dimensional and bland, it sounds like it was procedurally generated using an algorithm instead of human hands. Don’t even get me started about the romance writing: I’ve read hentai with better writing and character development than this shit.<br />
<br />
Genjitsu’s worldbuilding is also filled with more holes than swiss cheese. Everything we’re told just seems to contradict what we were previously told.<br />
<br />
The entire plot of the story is centred around a supposed food shortage that drove the nation to the brink of collapse. So drastic in fact that they’re ready to sell off a hero only they can summon. Great. Except when Souma takes over, we see literally jack shit evidence of a severe food crisis. Where’s the rioting? The angry citizens? The STARVING CITIZENS? You’re trying to tell me there’s a food shortage when the overwhelming majority of the low-middle class look totally healthy. We had a whole episode dedicated to showcasing “starving people” more untraditional food options, but you’re trying to tell me people weren’t starving enough to be desperately trying to eat whatever they could get their hands on? Pathetic, and it’s a disgrace to people who have faced/are actively facing poverty, malnourishment, or famine.<br />
<br />
What about EP 7? The new port isn’t supposed to conflict/compete with the port under the jurisdiction of the water duchess, but Souma proceeds to explain how they’ll make this port the “heart of the nation”, essentially contradicting his previous assurance to Liscia. What a joke. Also, realist doesn’t do any research into surrounding settlements or try to gain approval near the planned location which leads to this “conflict” that must be resolved. Really, this is just a masked lazy attempt at making MC seem imperfect and to apply the “plan doesn’t go according to plan” trope so his main harem girl can appreciate his “imperfect character.” Apparently, I’m also supposed to believe it costs more to mass mint medals (which are never made out of pure precious metals btw, it’s always a mix) than it does to hand out royal wine reserved for the royal family and important guests? I guess I could sell my shit and become a millionaire in this world.<br />
<br />
The only bright spot in this anime is the relatively accurate depiction of basic micro and macroeconomic theories and laws. Outside of that, you have an anime with no inherent value whatsoever. Lacklustre plot, lacklustre characters, lacklustre writing, lacklustre animation and OST, and dog-water-ass worldbuilding. For an anime that’s trying to differentiate itself on being realistic, it sure fell sorely short of the piss-poor standards it set out for itself.<br />
<br />
If you’re looking to downgrade your IQ and waste your time, go ahead and crank this show on. Otherwise, you’d do best to stay the fuck away.

    I need a herooooo!!! I&#039;m holding out for a hero &#039;til the end of the ni, ight~!<br />
He&#039;s gotta be a chick magnet<br />
And he&#039;s gotta have no personality <br />
And he&#039;s gotta be...a realist!?!? <br />
<br />
Realist Hero might seem like it&#039;s not worth your time on the surface. The premise certainly sounds familiar. Man gets transported to a fantasy world and is tasked with helping it out with his knowledge and/or power. He meets many impressionable young girls along the way, including a knight and an animal girl loli, and they all fall for him for inexplicable reasons. If this storyline sounds bland and soulless to you, then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418309">
        that&#039;s because you&#039;ve seen this anime before in the form of Death March, Isekai wa Smartphone, and a plethora of others. But wait! This anime does one thing so different, so original, that it completely flips the script. <br />
<br />
The hero is a realist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pray tell, what does this mean?&quot; Your curious mind might be wondering. Why, this essentially means that the protagonist understands basic concepts on how to manage a territory and its resources and spends entire episodes explaining these things to the stupid cast who are in awe of his intelligence because they apparently know absolutely nothing. Some even pledge their lives to him when he simply tells them rudimentary practices. And that is the entire show. Wow, how exciting! This dude is certainly flipping the switch on stereotypical hero roles!! I love watching characters stand completely still and talk about farming for 20 minutes!!!<br />
<br />
The characters are all very memorable, they range from fat guy to girl with big boobs. The female lead dresses in a military outfit and wears her hair in a ponytail, which shows that she&#039;s a strong, independent woman. She still falls for the hero though and becomes completely dependent on him after 10 minutes because his penmanship technique is sooooo irresistible. Oh, and all of these characters have an aptitude, that one skill that makes them truly special. And when I learned about how weird and seemingly worthless their talents are when it comes to bettering a nation, my expectations were certainly subverted! Wow, stuff like this almost makes me forget about the substandard production values!<br />
<br />
Through watching, I discovered something truly eye opening. The two leads are voiced by Inori Minase and Kobayashi Yuusuke, who are the seiyuu for Rem and Subaru from Re:Zero. This has led me to conclude that the casting director is a RemXSubaru shipper. This is clearly the most important piece of information that has come out of The Realist Hero. And now that I&#039;ve told you, you don&#039;t have to bother watching it!<br />

    Genjitsu yuusha is nice by all means , but <br />
Just to fulfill the isekai checklist it had to make that same mistake <br />
Add a harem,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the harem genre is one of my favorites don&#039;t get me wrong i (WE) love it and it has its own charms but we can all agree that if deathnote had a harem it would really out of place and weird that is what happens in realist hero as well we have all the political back and forth and the smarts and all that but then there is multiple girls fawning on him for no ahem ahem “realistic” reason .The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409714">
        only reason i feel the cover girl  exists so far is to ask soma questions and make him seem cool while also being a waifu which is why i am dissatisfied with the harem being there in an otherwise fantastic show.<br />
<br />
The show overall is a really fun ride which focuses on the political elements of a somewhat medieval setting and using logic and politics as well as a bit of economics to make a failed kingdom a better one . To put it simply it is log horizon minus the guilds and multiple people reincarnated with shiroe(soma) being the king of a failed state. It does try to follow most of the isekai tropes but hey that has its own fans right?I like the fact that the MC is likeable and not some kirito knowall with a degree in every possible subject on earth , his knowledge seems to be more about Human resource and how to get shit done which is kind of a big deal even in our world you know.<br />
<br />
The art is well done even if it does present the standard isekai setting , it tries and succeeds in telling us about the country lore , conflicts and issues in a very concise and practical manner and i like how well done and properly explained the map was not putting its title of realist to shame, voice acting seems to have some prominent names and is being carried out in a relatively good manner , characters are a little lifeless except of the new minister OP is great and so is the ED , they haven&#039;t had the chance to show off any animation yet<br />
<br />
If you like log horizon or isekais in general you are sure to love this, However even if you are not an isekai fan this is one of the Better takes on the genre so please do give it a shot !<br />

    Y&#039;know, I really wanted to believe that this show had at least a calibre of doing things &quot;same same but different&quot;. But as it stands, Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki (or its short form &quot;Realist Hero&quot; I&#039;ll be referring to from now on) just sorta went downhill as the series progresses for me. Maybe you&#039;d like it, but personally I have watched shows that have similar settings, but just executed a lot more better a.k.a Log Horizon. And also, while I appreciate that there&#039;s a variety of Isekai in the Summer season, there&#039;s hits and misses, and this sadly falls under the latter.<br />
<br />
To be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418306">
        fair, what novelist Dojyomaru has on hand is quite the interesting story plot about an Isekai where politics and power play come into mind: it&#039;s basically Kingdom Administration (or more appropraitely Re:Construction). A story about an Otherworlder (Kazuya Souma) who got Isekai-ed to not just play the role of the hero, but instead, to be the next king in a kingdom where it&#039;s falling apart at the seams against all odds of threats coming both left and right. It&#039;s not just the usual typical trope of the Demon Lord&#039;s army&#039;s uprising, but also internal problems that leaves a kingdom incapable of supporting itself. With some words of wisdom from Kazuya&#039;s grandmother that &quot;A man needs to make a family and never fail to protect it no matter what.&quot;, he is summoned into the fantasy world as a hero first to help solve a crisis. But here&#039;s the twist: the humanities student Kazuya&#039;s no OP character, but he has his knowledge of realism and machiavellianism at his disposal to make whatever calls he desires as the roles are consequently handed down to him to help a kingdom come out of its deadly course, from a hero to a realist king. It&#039;s very similar to Civilization if you&#039;ve played the game before.<br />
<br />
This series starts out really slow and boring, because that&#039;s where the magic happens for Kazuya&#039;s crusade to save the Kingdom of Elfrieden that equals constant development over the course of its run. Nevertheless, even if Kazuya&#039;s new at the job of being king, he has to constantly decree numerous amout of reforms, conduct negotiations and do everything a king is supposed to do to win the war against the demons and other kingdoms that could wipe a developing kingdom. In order to understand this series generally, it hinges on these words: &quot;Slow but interesting&quot;. As far as I understand the pacing of the anime, as compared to the light novel of the same name, it can drag on for episodes with the rhetoric that to &quot;wait until something happens&quot;. And while that may be the series Achilles&#039; Heel, it&#039;s also the backbone of how some people would come to enjoy the series for what it is: consistency, that plays a major part of how Realist Hero is written to be that slow-burner, easily droppable, but fascinating work if you can stick it out &quot;for just one more chapter&quot; (that sadly, people don&#039;t have big brains to understand that it also is a creative concept of some authors who don&#039;t like to infodump all at one shot).<br />
<br />
The world-building of Realist Hero does not only kick its legs at the intended story plot, it has to include characters that drive its narrative together with Kazuya&#039;s realism mentality of kingdom administrative reforms. I have to say that the Elfrieden Council of advisories to the current king are quite the livid frustration, because kingdoms in the past ages can be a lot authoritarian with its leadership and regime, and in this case, they are the last ones that could help save the kingdom of what&#039;s left. But to summon a hero-turned-king such as Kazuya to solve their issues, it&#039;s a huge demand on his shoulders to pounce on all that at once, and him using his avaliable powers and resources to save that which is and could be lost is truly a godsend.<br />
<br />
There is also the traditional tropey Isekai formula of the harem to help Kazuya, and in this case, a mixed bag of execution of some good and some bad. Kicking things off with the Elfrieden crown princess Liscia, she is the one who stood by Kazuya&#039;s side the most ever since the position takeover, and is quite the amusing character to see. I mean, sure, getting forcefully engaged with Kazuya is not necessarily the right move from a family such as her&#039;s. It really looks like her royal family just gave up all hope and passed the baton onto Kazuya, which her father King Albert just approves and abdicates the throne to him, making Liscia the next queen in the process to this unequivocal guy who is both IQ and EQ smart to handle. This forces Liscia to a corner, but what choices does she have than to go with her hopeless father&#039;s wishes. Eventually, her relationship blossoms with Kazuya becoming the typical boy-girl relationship, but on a much higher pedestal being king and queen of Elfrieden. And for those who like your waifus, Liscia can bear a polyamory relationship, so that&#039;s a first if I&#039;ve ever heard of someone who can accept being a concubine, but of course adamantly wanting to be 1st place (like any other true wife),<br />
<br />
Alas, there are just too many characters in this show that while each of them makes useful contributions to Kazuya&#039;s kingdom reforms, this move is generally good for such a fantasy world of historical origins. But I&#039;d feel like that the adage of &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot; is prevalent, and this is a series that awfully needs that lot in order for the story and plot to work. As mentioned of the harem, there&#039;re some potential waifus that make up the bulk of Kazuya&#039;s ministerial team (Aisha Udgard who acts as Kazuya&#039;s bodyguard, Juna Doma who acts as Kazuya&#039;s peace-time minister-cum-idol symbol to name a few) plus some men (Hakuya Kwonmin as Kazuya&#039;s strategist; Poncho Panacotta as Kazuya&#039;s literate &quot;Shokugeki no Souma&quot;, it&#039;s in the name), it&#039;s equivocally hard to get invested in most characters if they&#039;re just serving their purposes, and regrettably the anime does that a lot which results in loss of focus. It&#039;s a shame, really.<br />
<br />
Also, J.C.Staff, I should give you a new nickname: from &quot;Justifying Creative Staff&quot; to &quot;Just Crap Stuff&quot;, because Realist Hero does feel decently produced. But it&#039;s clear where the budget is centrally focused at: the wonky 3DCG camerawork, which I don&#039;t know if going by in-house veteran director Takashi Watanabe&#039;s direction to include that does make the anime at the very least interesting to give a perspective. If all this was just an experiment for a guinea pig test of sorts, then I&#039;m not sorry to say that it is weird to see such disparity in the face of inconsistency against the backdrops of the half-assed visuals and bad animation. This guy has done a lot of classic J.C.Staff shows from the mid-2000s, but as well as I want to trust that this director knows what he&#039;s doing, this just contributes to the miniscule side of failures.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always said this: even if the anime fails outright, the music aspect can be its saving grace. Dolorously, this aspect is worse than so-so. I&#039;ve heard a lot of songs from Inori Minase over the years, and the OP &quot;Hello Horizon&quot; is a good ol&#039; catchy song, but compared to her repertoires before, this can be placed into the bottom of a B-roll double-sided CD. What I find absolutely offending is the ED song and its visuals, which can be very comparable to a PowerPoint presentation, just add some animation of its lyrics in there to complete the song. Just pure laziness. What the hell?<br />
<br />
All of this begs the question: &quot;Why then contribute your work to a show where there&#039;s clearly no passion be to shown?&quot; Realist Hero overall, can be a better show if given the right talents and a production staff team who are truly dedicated to the work. But as it stands of the current state of the anime industry, it&#039;s just rolls over to us the audience to pick up the original source material, because it&#039;s a promotional work first and foremost. We&#039;ve seen big-hit works get phenomenal because of the anime doing justice to the source material (e.g. the most recent being Tokyo Revengers), but this just saddens LN fans (like a certain Typecero) and anime-onlies who wanted more from a political Isekai show such as Realist Hero.<br />
<br />
This show could&#039;ve been a decent potential series, but the anime just squandered it to insensibility and pure stupefaction. Good thing Season 2 is coming in Winter 2022, so at least the story has a continuation to cure that disease-ridden mindset.

    I&#039;ll get straight to the point: (NO SPOILERS) <br />
<br />
If you love Log Horizon, like incredibly logical and somewhat unconventionally thinking character, enjoyed Tycoon games as a kid, and have been looking for a more mature take on the isekai genre, stop reading and go watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki is basically Country Tycoon the Anime, the show where we can vicariously rule a nation through our main character Kazuya once every week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 7 (+3 if you’ve got somewhat of a God complex)<br />
You’re going to find this incredibly boring if you’re not into smart characters using their intellect to shape the world around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409734">
        them. The name of the anime basically describes everything you’d expect to see. <br />
This is an isekai anime, so demihumans and magic will spice things up a bit making all the plot twists and curveballs our hero will have to face in the upcoming episodes something to look forward to.<br />
<br />
It’s really not going to blow you away unless you really like this type of thing, think Shiroe from Log Horizon, Lelouch from Code Geass, and Senku from Dr Stone. These are all characters with an intellect that basically makes them gods to the people around them and made them the main drivers of the anime&#039;s story.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
We have smart, strong, non-over the top female characters??? In an Isekai anime???<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is likeable, but the main characters, absolutely beautiful.<br />
I cared about the two main characters from the second they met each other, I know you will too.<br />
If you’re fed up with the repeated anime troupes that Konosuba so beautifully displayed, you’ll love this. This is a burst of fresh air. <br />
There are obviously still a lot of typical anime troupes, these are necessary to give meat to the characters without having to give each on a character arc.  <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
It’s average, there’s nothing wrong with being average especially with the new standards set by JJK, Demon Slayer and every subsequent anime that has seen their animators step up their game (I really hope they’re being paid more though).<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Once again, nothing mind blowing. It’s good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I’ll hammer this in one more time…<br />
<br />
Country Tycoon the anime, smart characters shaping the world around them, a more mature take on the isekai genre.<br />
Why are you still here?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Starting to feel a lot more isekai and childlike now (has some more adult humour though) -1 point on everything<br />

    Watching &quot;Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki&quot; felt like watching a trash Sunday night TV Show where every single episode ends up with the main character finding something, but it doesn&#039;t show the viewer right away, but promises to do it in the next episode. That&#039;s some Bollywood smart-ass tactics I can say. Yea that&#039;s how I just see this anime. I Have seen like 6 episodes and I can already say that the story goes exactly nowhere, the characters are so generic you can barely get attached to any of them. First of all you have the main characters who everyone thinks that he is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415754">
        &quot;special&quot; or something and the female main character which is just some cheap ass king&#039;s daughter, with no special talent or special abilities. Then you have the supporting characters and of course it needs to be more cute girls so the main female character gets jealous when any of those girls approach the main male character and yea... And one of the girls sings like what the hell, it wasn&#039;t cringe enough that we always end up episodes with some raveling but not show it? Wow, we sing, What is this ? &quot;How a realist hero rebuilt the high school musical&quot; ? Get your shit together. Of course we have an useless fat dude that does nothing but eating and talking about food. And then there is that smart dude who looks kind of evil, but he is not and he joins forces with the main male character, just to betray him in the end (probably, that didn&#039;t happen in the six episodes that I saw, I&#039;m just assuming that will happen because that&#039;s what happens in every generic Isekai)<br />
After finishing some episodes you might ask yourself: &quot;Didn&#039;t I watch this anime already ? &quot; Most of the episodes are way too similar and they add zero to the story. &quot;Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki&quot; is just your generic Sunday Isekai where nothing really happens.

    When I first was looking through this season, and picking what I wanted to watch. I had found this show, and it peaked my interest. Being that I love fantasy, who doesn&#039;t? But I do love a bit of business too. So to see those two, sort of mixed, it comes across as a great idea. In a sense, maybe like Animal Crossing, where you are in charge of helping things, set up things, all the while taking profit into consideration. It all sounds like a recipe for success. There is just one slight issue...<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a harem for some reason.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m not saying Harems are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409728">
        bad. But you watch from the first few episodes, and you&#039;ll see that this show didn&#039;t really need a harem idea in the first place. It would&#039;ve been fine without it.Does it make it a less enjoyable experience? No, it doesn&#039;t. It feels like a bit of a fresh air on the Isekai scene. Much like a certain other two in this season, it&#039;s actually nice seeing an Isekai, without the same ol stick happening. <br />
<br />
As the story follows Kazuya Souma, a &#039;hero&#039; whom was summoned in typical Isekai fashion, and his way of being such, is more saving the kingdom&#039;s financial problems, and helping it establish itself, and grow better. Which already sounds like a much better plotline then a normal run of the mill Isekai. There is a lot to like about Souma too. He really does seem to have the best interests at heart, and even takes in a wide range of people to help with fixing the kingdom. A good bloke for sure. Another main character is Liscia, who is the daughter of the previous king, who honestly with how she looks, gives me Saber vibes lol.  But she is very strong willed, and has a strong and good personality. Can&#039;t go wrong there. Besides them however, there is a far few interesting characters to boot, some good, some bad, or least not praise worthy, like the King just really disappoints me, wit how weak he can come across at points.<br />
<br />
The art style seems nice really. Can&#039;t really say anything bad about it, much like the sound of the show. Both are fitting, and look and sound good. What more could you want honestly? Like, I really do love how some of the outfits look, and the style really brings that out in all honesty. Very well done on both ends.<br />
<br />
Despite having a harem tagline for some reason. This show is a good watch all round, so get to watching now!<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
I love political anime. My favorite anime of all time include “Legend of the Galactic Heroes,” “Code Geass,” and “Attack on Titan.” These are masterpieces and very worth watching. “Re:Construction” is not.<br />
What makes the shows I listed so compelling is not simply that they depict realpolitik, and are therefore amazing -- but that they present real-feeling characters with extremely nuanced motivations who are forced to confront their own morality and struggle with the weight of their decisions and the consequences of their actions as the world rests upon their shoulders. It’s hard enough to have a good story on any level without

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418357">
        compelling characters, let alone in a genre where every motivation and driving factor is in and of itself a statement. Thus, one of the very worst mistakes that you could make in the political genre is to feature a cast of generic and boring characters who’s actions lack any depth -- “Re:Construction” is a political anime that features a cast of generic and boring characters who’s actions lack any depth.<br />
<br />
The main character himself is uncharismatic and dull. His attributes essentially consist of: “is smart,” “is from another world,” and “works too much.” He has virtually no personality to speak of. Not only does he never make a provocative decision ever, but his reactions to situations are “just about what you would expect from the main character of a bad light novel” to the tee, with a hint of semi-creative problem solving sprinkled in. I would describe him as nothing less than the ultimate cop-out of character writing. This is first of all, just plain awful storytelling, and second of all making for an unrealistic depiction of someone who is supposed to be a great leader. Furthermore, his lack of an interesting or complex motivation (or any real motivation at all, for that matter) prevents the show from leading into deep insights about what purpose his decisions are being made for. His supposedly vast intelligence is also depicted inconsistently: he spent days doing nothing but studying the world of Friedonia at the beginning of the series, but he is shown to not be able to recite basic knowledge of geopolitics or magic throughout the season. I don’t expect him to learn everything overnight, but he can’t name a single foreign country for crying out loud!<br />
During the last few episodes, we get a glimpse at how Souma is supposed to get a bit deeper than the standard “isekai dude” ordeal, and I’m honestly just left scratching my head. Despite being a “realist” or whatever, as well as a supposed believer in liberal principals, Souma apparently still has his qualms about “not being the real king,” for… some reason. This is completely inconsistent with every meritocratic tendency of his that we’ve seen built up to this point, and with the entirety of Souma’s already-established relaxed mindset. This is all just for it all to be turned around when he goes back to his “normal self” after giving up his *death wish* (yeah, it’s a little extreme; I’m confused as well) for the sake of the girl he loves and the family he wants to protect! It’s just about as stupid as I make it sound. Aside from the troubling implications that this brings up for his heavy-handed dedication to a fake romance, this whole little arc is contrived on character depth that doesn’t actually exist on the behalf of Souma. There is no backstory or literally any reason at all really given at all as to why he starts to think this way, but this last-minute stupid little breakdown is supposed to serve as the basis for what’s supposed to be the meat and bones of the main protagonist’s entire character development. I mean people liked Reigen well enough, so we might as well as copy him. Everyone should get imposter syndrome now! I suppose at this point I might be reading more into it than the author ever originally intended, but I guess that this means that the whole “generic smart character without a personality” was supposed to be a front that he used to hide from his insecurities. But what insecurities this clues us towards, and how on earth it’s relevant to anything else ever established about this character throughout the entire series is totally beyond me. Kazuya Souma is, simply put, an awfully written and grievously contrived character.<br />
<br />
Apart from Mr. Anime Protagonist himself, we have two animal-ear lolis, a tsundere, a fat comedic relief guy, a shadowy smart dude, three girls with big boobs, two of whom look identical to each other, a dozen or so proud warrior generals with carbon-copy personalities, and one of the not-quite-a-tsundere archetype girls that Darkness from Konosuba is a parody of. Original. I know. Aside from the tsundere girl that Souma was forced into having a marriage with (yeah, it’s this again) being generally useless when it comes to politics, only Hakuya out of the five “talented” individuals hand-picked for the royal court is actually competent. The fact that exposition is almost always delivered through explanation, rather than narration or demonstration, strengthens the sentiment that all of these characters are kind of idiots who don’t know their geopolitical up from down. Exactly zero of supporting characters are interesting in any way, shape, or form. And basically all of them, except for the waifu girl, (of course,) are forgotten about entirely at one point or another throughout the season, with the only discernable reason being that there are too many bad characters in this series to shoehorn them all in for every episode. Seriously, isn’t Hakuya supposed to be a genius or something? Why don’t we see him doing anything, ever? All of these characters are basically cookie-cutter tropes designed to construct a by-the-books marketing strategy, not to be meaningful or useful to the story in any way at all.<br />
Poncho, for example, was hired for his astute sense of taste, which he used to introduce new food to the kingdom. My issue here is that this implies that the inhabitants of this country haven’t known their left from right in terms of what’s edible for however many generations this kingdom of stupid people has managed to survive. Take the fishers, who catch octopuses with their nets, every day, who, for the entire history of this country, just threw them away without ever learning that they could be eaten. And the one person in the whole world who was aware of this just happened to be the glutton that Souma hired. This really does feel like the writers just wanted any reason they could to fit in an exotic “Food Wars!”-like Sequence, and not like they genuinely thought that a good sense of taste was a great enough quality to change the fate of a nation. The story would not have changed one bit if this guy was just cut from it entirely. Seriously, what kind of a Machiavellian puts a dumb overweight Michelin Inspector in charge of an entire body of government? This guy has paperwork to do too, doesn’t he? There’s no way that I’m going to just believe that this useless waste of tax money operates efficiently without a dedicated manager of some sort.<br />
<br />
In fact, we aren’t shown Souma rejecting a single “talent” at all. Any fictionalized political exploration worth its weight in such a scenario would put in a good rejection or two, and probably fire the old incompetent aristocrats to prove a point. This would show that 1. its protagonist is a good judge of character, and 2. that the politics of its world are, in fact, like politics -- that is to say, cruel and harsh, and not a task that just anyone can be made useful for. Think about the times Lelouch calls his subordinates idiots behind their backs or when Reinhard von Lohengramm rejects a bribe. This is what establishes your politics as “realist.” Souma, by contrast, comes across in this regard as a yes-man and as someone who looks to find ways to validate the pride of everyone he comes across. Indeed, he would go on to not antagonize a single soul for any reason at all and the plot seems to just magically make room for things to go smoothly with these stupid decisions. He even tells his own inept advisors to not quit once they realize that they’re outclassed by new talent. One particular example of this is when he revises an entire infrastructure plan because some old man said it would overlap with the domain of a sea god, and Souma decided that the risk of a tsunami was too high for the long-term, and instead of commissioning dikes or something like a reasonable person, he reorganizes an entire ongoing national megaproject. Yeah, talk about stupid. This decision was made despite the fact that the infrastructure plan in question was only supposed to be a short-term ordeal that would solve the food crisis and serve as a basis to expand upon for long-term projects anyways. What makes this even more baffling, though, is that the characters in the show go on to criticize him for the OPPOSITE of this and claim he “casts aside too much,” even though we haven’t seen him muster the courage to cast aside *anyone,* *ever.* We only know that he fired anyone at all because we’re told so through dialogue. Why couldn’t this have been *shown* to us? Souma’s apparent capacity for cruelness isn’t demonstrated at all in any capacity throughout the series, yet we’re supposed to believe that it’s bad enough to cause an entire rebellion. In a similar vein, we get a lot of focus on the loved ones of killed off enemy leaders, (who all magically come around to liking Souma despite having lost the most important people in their lives to him,) without a care in the world for the friends and families of the countless thousands of foot soldiers that got slaughtered en masse at the same battles. Despite the show apparently being so “realist,” the lives of the many are all but meaningless in face of the lives of the few characters that actually have names. The show is so beyond tone deaf when it comes to matching its actions and words that it’s genuinely astonishing, even for seasonal trash. This might just be the most hypocritical series I’ve ever seen.<br />
Many points throughout the show seem to suggest opportunities to prove such ethical quandary and bring much-needed complexity to Souma’s moral compass, but are quickly brushed off, never to be mentioned again: He’s cutting off neighboring nations for self-benefit, even though infighting among the human realms could create a dangerous opening for the demon kingdom to exploit? We’ll quite literally shoot first, and ask questions later; The use of DSS Choker knock-offs, literally called “slave collars,” that can automatically behead POWs extrajudicially for thought-crimes and spontaneously break the 1929 Geneva Convention for him? Not even worth a discussion, I guess; He’s threatening to burn a major population center to the ground as part of his war effort, which an incredibly major crime against humanity? It’s alright, as long as the “good guys” can win the war! These moral predicaments feel as if they were DESIGNED to gateway into the sorts of deeper themes that make the political genre as good as it is, but all of it is just instantly forgotten about the moment that it’s time for the literal next scene. And what we’re left with is a sort of weird in-between zone where if you think about it, you realize that we’re not quite in the realm of sunshine-and-rainbows, main-character-does-no-wrong storytelling, but we’re not actually anywhere even remotely close to making real statements about moral ambiguity either.<br />
<br />
The world-building of the government itself and how our characters interact with it, comes across as stale and unrealistically stagnant. The main character, who is supposed to be quite the reformist, is dragged down by technicalities of the royal family and by a bloated aristocracy that serves no pragmatic purpose. Souma doesn’t even bother to reorganize the bureaucracy he relies on so much, which he himself describes as defunct. A good example of this is when he takes in Inui as an adopted little sister of Liscia and plays house for no reason. This is even though the smartest decision would have been to reject her publicly and keep her existence secret from foreign adversaries, who Souma correctly points out might attempt to use her talent to forge alliances with the demon kingdom. She’s not exactly as inconspicuous as Selim Bradley now that the whole country knows she was a talent candidate with the ability to “speak to animals,” and has now been suddenly adopted without an explicable reason. A good number of the scenario-building also seems strange: at one point a girl demonstrates her lack of understanding of population dynamics by recommending to solve the food shortage and to bring more people into the country in the same sentence; mercenaries are fired towards the beginning of the show due to their “dubious loyalty,” which implies that they weren’t fired in the first place due to the, y’know, ongoing heavily-emphasized money shortage; the navy branch of the military seems to have all sorts of strategic ground forces capabilities in what I can only describe as plot convenience; the lightning-fast acceptance of a civic-freedoms based ideology by the apparently nationalistic and king-loving Amadonia is beyond unrealistic, etcetera, etcetera. <br />
To this show’s credit, though, many of the scenarios presented are genuinely realistic and interesting. The bit about cotton inflation and how it contributed to a food shortage is rooted in real history, when the American South’s economy began to decline due to Egyptian competition. Also based on history is the “lying slave” tactic used by Duchess Excel to stall the enemies movements during the Siege of Altomura, a common tactic used throughout history, similar, but less nuanced than, for example, how Themistocles set a trap for Xerxes at the Battle of Salamis by having a servant relay false information, lying about the Greek formation and claiming the Greek forces were exhausted from infighting (although, I will note the presentation of this exchange at Altomura makes everyone involved seem like an idiot). The power-balancing between the three dukedoms of different races each guaranteed to functional high posts granted in the military is reminiscent of power-sharing agreements in real-world multiethnic states. The fact that Friedonia is non-signatory to the Mankind Declaration is, in fact, quite “realist,” similar to how the modern United States simultaneously ignores and enforces UNCLOS. The magic-powered technology is not only interesting, but it also allows the Souma’s other-world experience to be genuinely useful -- the use of a magic-based “television” network to broadcast state propaganda strikes me as particularly creative in this regard. And so on, and so forth. While these generally aren’t the most hard-to-come-up-with ideas ever, I would argue that when these insights actually make sense, they are the sole redeeming factor of the show. The fact that I am still severely underwhelmed by this all proves to me, though, more than anything, that simply having a decent scenario or two in mind doesn’t automatically make them narratively compelling without emotional development or otherwise decent character writing to go along with it -- which I’ve already noted is severely lacking in this series through-and-through.<br />
<br />
For all the hype “Re:Construction” builds around its war arc, these episodes are by far the least intensive in terms of how complex the political situation is. Two out of the three generals of the country’s different branches take it upon themselves to war against Souma in order to restore the honor of the previous king (who has barely even made an appearance since the first episode, but whatever) -- they’re going to war! I guess. My main issue with this arc is that the tactics in this anime are approached in the same way that all of the random political stuff was. There is a great emphasis on a single “wow”-factor that’s designed to make a casual viewer think “Souma is super smart,” and then we get a little bit of explanation and that’s that. No weight is given to lives lost, ideology and motivational factors are given no thought at all, there’s no sense of urgency, and it just doesn’t feel like how “war” is supposed to feel on any level at all. It really is just as campy as you would expect from any unspectacular isekai season finale arc. This seems like it would be a great opportunity to introduce interesting and complex ways of manipulating the magic system to gain a tactical advantage, but that just never happens. The strategies and tactics are, like most of the ideas thrown around the show, somewhat interesting on a surface level, but easily forgettable, and not exactly put together with passion. <br />
The new characters introduced at this point in the series are also predictably one-dimensional and stale. George Carmine’s only personality trait is his honor. He is so honorable, in fact, that none of his actions actually make any sense or are motivated by actual reason! Quite impressive. His subordinates vary in character from the same sort of “honor-boundness” as he has to “corrupt noble.” Not the most exciting bunch. The Amidonian dude is also basically a cut-and-paste of the same guy, but without the lion’s mane. Glad to see a bit of diversity. Vargas, on the other hand, does have half of a personality, but his given ideals are wishy-washy and based on such frankly ludicrous-sounding principals that feel like they were designed to make him seem like he’s Oskar von Reuenthal or something, when in reality he doesn’t have any real depth at all. His subordinate girl is basically the same character as Aisha. This whole arc just feels like a lame excuse to deliver some action to cap off the season in a vaguely exciting way, even though “Re:Construction” tried to presented itself from the get-go as a more plain, down-to-earth political experience. The feeling that this arc is “out-of-place” in this series is reinforced by the incredibly dull animation and generally nonsensical choreography featured in fighting scenes. Furthermore, the idea of this being a “realist” combat situation based on smart tactical maneuvers and the like is undermined once the named characters step in and start effortlessly rolling foot soldiers like they’re state alchemists or something, despite not actually being canonical super-soldiers. A high-intensity combat arc with especially loose strings of logic is perhaps the least fitting way “Re:Construction” could have rounded itself off, yet I somehow feel like I’m not actually that surprised.<br />
<br />
The quality of the artwork and animation for most of the series is the bare minimum of “passable,” meaning that the characters look decent in up-close shots, and you shouldn’t be paying that much attention to how anything else on the screen looks. The world aesthetic and character designs are based on the same mind-boggling generic isekai art style that should come across as “impressive” to absolutely no one at this point. You’ve seen this look a million and a half times already. <br />
That’s all kind of “whatever,” but the real kicker is how the visual quality suddenly drops in the final few episodes for the war arc. Here, the budget apparently couldn’t keep up with actually well-choreographed fight scenes, and we get a lot of dumb-looking attacks thrown around to topple enemy soldiers in dumb-looking ways, which culminates in some real dumb-looking and nonsensical combat styles. If the action itself isn’t hard enough to look at, the expressions and casual movements of the characters get noticeably stiffer from this point onwards, presumably due to budgetary constraints, the CGI battle flags look noticeably stupid, and the foot soldiers have just about the lowest-effort designs that you could possibly imagine. Seriously, don’t look at those guys too hard.<br />
The theme songs are just about as generic as you could possibly get as well. Not only is the opening animation just another mediocre sequence of character b-roll shots, but the lyrics are actually quite ironic as well. A series that attempts to present itself as cold-hearted and realist can’t help itself from singing about “being your true self” and “believing in what you believe in,” as if it’s drawing inspiration from Kamina or something. Not exactly the most Machiavellian of ideals for a show that prides itself on how Machiavellian it is. The ending theme, which greets the eye with some text and not a lot else, somehow manages to clash even worse: we get the same romantic bird metaphor that you saw in “Darling in the FranXX,” coupled with wishy-washy talk about awaiting a miracle through courage. Did this show feature even a single genuinely romantic moment, and I just missed it; or does it just sing about romance because they couldn’t get better songs? -- A good theme song doesn’t need to be a perfect match with a show’s themes (although it is quite special when it is), but it definitely should not outright contradict the message you’re trying to push either. The entire brand identity that we’re working with to separate this show from any other isekai on the planet is how “realist” it’s supposed to be, yet a cornerstone of the crystallization of brand identity -- the theme songs -- are just wishy-washy mass-consumption love songs! Thucydides must be rolling in his grave!<br />
<br />
The whole series, in fact, feels like it was written on a whim after the author got some big ideas reading “The Prince” (which, by the way, has the distinction of being the ONLY real-world intellectual source Souma draws ideas from), but it never bothers to stick with its guns for even half a second, and the interesting character growth that I’ve come to expect from this genre is nowhere to be found. “Re:Construction” is, thus, in essence, just another poorly-conceived seasonal isekai light novel adaptation that people will hopefully forget about after a month or two, and it has extremely little in common with the masterpieces it compares itself to by presenting itself as political. All of this makes me wonder -- “who is ‘Re:Construction’ actually written for?” If you’re like me and you’re fascinated by geopolitical chessboards, then this show’s handful of unrealistic scenarios and exhaustive cast of unrealistic characters that inhabit it should boggle your mind more and more as you find plothole after plothole. If you just want something to turn your brain off to, then there are thousands of other isekais out there that don’t ask you to think too hard about anything going on. <br />
If you’re looking for a good political drama, then defer to my recommendations I made at the top of this review. If you just want to think hard about politics, and don’t care much for a story, then watch a Caspian Report video; you might actually learn something. Whatever you’re looking for, though, “Re:Construction” probably isn’t it.<br />

    Quality trumps quantity and I&#039;m sure most of us prefer to watch an anime that is enjoyable than something with tons of never ending episodes or seasons. In the anime industry today, we have countless isekai that adapts all sort of tropes. It&#039;s become so common that once you&#039;ve seen a few, it felt like you&#039;ve seen them all. What does that say about How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom?<br />
<br />
For starters, we have to understand that the show is somewhat atypical with its storytelling standards, at least for an isekai. Rather than presenting a plot with a hero trying to save the world or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418353">
        going on some fantasy adventure, he&#039;s trying to save a kingdom by rebuilding it. Think of the series as a kingdom management game where the protagonist is the player and controls assets, resources, and followers. When watching the show, it became obvious that our protagonist has a lot to learn to deal with the civil unrest and rebuilding of a kingdom. Meet Kazuya Souma, the man whose life changes forever after being transported to Kingdom of Elfrieden and becomes its ruler.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Kazuya doesn&#039;t come across as an unique individual. He looks like an average man but with a passionate personality and realist point of view. As a realist hero, he is also human and that means he makes mistakes. Being a ruler is no easy task and he learns the hard way when dealing with his followers. At the same time, he&#039;s an eager learner and always seeks solutions to problems. Luckily, he&#039;s not alone. Kazuya is aided by a diverse group of foreigners with different backgrounds and skills. These include the crown princess Lisica, songstress Juna Doma, dark elf chief Aisha, among others. What&#039;s important to understand is not how Kazuya treats them but how he develops relationships and use them to build his kingdom. And trust me, it&#039;s a complicated journey.<br />
<br />
Describing the character roster feels like trying being in an RPG game where each party member is an important asset. Perhaps the most prominent one is Lisicia, a strong willed girl but also somewhat inexperienced in her role. With Kazuya&#039;s guidance, she learns the way of the kingdom and supports him during his travels. From politics to military experience, Lisicia&#039;s character has a lot of potential and this season explores some of those aspects. Juna Doma represents the mature character of the show as she demonstrates virtue and elegance. She&#039;s also fairly intelligent, wise, and loyal to Kazuya, which are all traits imperative for her role. In contrast, there&#039;s the dark elf Aisha who serves more as a muscle. While she can be airheaded, Aisha is also very couragous and isn&#039;t afraid to fight for what she believes in, regardless how challenging it can be. To me, that represents the heart of the Kazuya&#039;s group for she is able to stand strong when a situation gets rough. Finally, we have Roroa and perhaps the odd one from the main character roster. Honestly, she stands out less compare to the others but is known to be cleverly manipulative at times. We don&#039;t see her often until the latter stages of the series, when she put her plans to motion.<br />
<br />
As a fantasy  drama that combines military politics, management, relationship building, and character studies, it&#039;s not easy to flesh out the anime in just 13 episodes. Luckily, the anime itself knows what it needed to do to establish its main premise from the beginning. By throwing an ordinary guy like Kazuya in a fantasy setting, it tests his intelligence, integrity, and ultimately, showing us what type of ruler he can really be. When king Albert and prime minister Marx took the risk to assign Kazuya as a kingdom ruler, they made a calculated choice. To further more, he is offered by Albert to marry his daughter, Lisicia. Yes, you can bet that will set off some red flags as the romance element of the show can feel forced at times. Kazuya&#039;s humbleness and determination also draws other female characters to him such as Aisha. However, don&#039;t expect this any sort of Cinderella-like romance. This anime isn&#039;t a love story.<br />
<br />
Despite the limited amount of action, we do see combat at times when the call needs for it. One of the most prominent threat to the Kingdom of Elfrieden is Castor, as he presents to be a military challenge during the civil war. Gaius also proves to be a troubling individual to deal with especially when he declares to kill Kazuya. it isn&#039;t until Kazuya&#039;s clever thinking as a ruler that he stops the invasion and ultimately comes up with a compromise to save the kingdom. The war drama and battles often feels like old school fantasy mixed with magic and technology. Remember, this show takes place in a world where science is absent and Kazuya realized this from the beginning. It&#039;s just up to him to make use of his skills and be the voice for the voiceless.<br />
<br />
Adapted by studio J.C. Staff, they handled this show with care and tried to adapt the characters as they should be. The word here is &#039;tried&#039; because at some occasions, it doesn&#039;t hit the bullesye. Characters such as Juna looks less appealing compared to their light novel or manga counterparts. Kazuya himself may be hard to accept as a king due to his average looks. Still, the anime maintains a fantasy level of credibility. It looks like a world built on the Unreal Engine with an acceptable level of technical quality. Still, if I was being honest, I&#039;d say the show could&#039;ve improved more in the art department. <br />
<br />
How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom is the type of anime that crafted a premise with kingdom management and building around a protagonist with his followers. It&#039;s a show that encompasses military drama, political topics, and character relationships. With 13 episodes, it did manage to capture the essence of the show. It&#039;s far from a masterpiece but stands above the endless amount of isekai shenanigans we see every season.

Rebuilding a kingdom not through might but through words, change and diplomacy <br />
<br />
Based on a popular light novel series of the same name Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki which is more popularly known among both anime watchers and readers of the light novel as How a Realist Hero rebuilt the kingdom is an action, fantasy and romance genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day Kazuya Souma a 19-year-old college

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418313">
        student is suddenly transported to another world after the death of his most cherished grandfather. However, what if instead of being summoned and granted the combat ability of a battlemaster or the power to use supernatural powers that allows users to use the knowledge that they accumulated in previous lives to enact plans of action that our hero was one that while having neither instead possessed an extensive amount of knowledge on economics and governance and most importantly a desire to rebuild a country from the ground up. In this we have our hero Kazuma Souma who while lacking brawn and powerful magic that characterizes the Isekai genre is one that’s every bit as equal in his ability to use his knowledge to not only change the country but the world as well. <br />
<br />
On the surface, while the series itself has much of the trappings of the Isekai genre what served to differentiate it in my view was the fact that much of the plans and reforms that he enacts over the course of the series overall narrative is a result of not unmatched combat ability nor mysterious magic that transcends even death as other Isekai shows featured but rather simple replication and application of modern-day economic and governance practices that allowed him to readily reignite the embers of a declining nation and rebuild it into something that its people are content with living in. This combination of a desire to rebuild a nation from the ground up with modern-day techniques when used in combination with Souma’s innate intelligence, charm and ability at foresight I felt really served to make the show stand out from among its peers within the genre as these served to make the series narrative and premise that much more interesting and unpredictable and serving well to draw me to this series. The series opening episode I felt while doing a great job of introducing the main character of Kazuya Souma also did well to showcase not only the dire straits the world and the kingdom of Elfriden kingdom is in thanks to the demon lord’s domain but also the daunting task of governing it as its newly crowned king after being given the role. <br />
<br />
Kazuya Souma <br />
<br />
Kazuya Souma portrayed by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Our Last crusade or the Rise of a new world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 19-year-old student that lived in modern-day Japan prior to his summon to the kingdom of Elfriden and appointed as its new king Kazuya from his initial appearances was shown to be a quiet, calm and composed person by nature that while intelligent and well versed in a wide variety of topics was also someone that was capable of not only analyzing its teachings but also applying it in practice as well as shown in the many reforms that he had enacted after taking charge. While a kind and understanding person by nature Kazuya was also a realist and shown to be particularly adept at determining the hearts and personalities of men both in terms of his kingdoms social classes as well as his own people aspects that served to not only allow him to determine the priorities for rebuilding the kingdom but also determine the best ways in which he can win the trust of the people a combination that I felt served to not only establish himself not only as a new king but one that while readily admitting his own inexperience as a ruler was someone that cared little about either tradition, social classes or races and was someone whose first priority was in improving the quality of life for its people by modernizing both its infrastructure and economy even if it meant placing himself in opposition to powerful nobles and ever-ambitious foreigners who would love nothing more than to seize control of a kingdom that has a rookie king at its helm. On the surface, while setting himself to face not only the task of rebuilding and modernizing his country but also planning to unite it against any foreign invasion may sound like one that will be impossible for one man to achieve I believed that the twin tasks served as an excellent means to create the foundation to which Kazuya can use to stand upon as he sets about improving the country’s tech level and allow his people to live safely and in relative comfort. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses and Kazuya’s efforts to modernize the country are complicated by opposition from not only the nobles but also natural disasters and foreign interventions from opportunistic rivals Kazuya’s personality slowly begins to change as he is forced to adapt to an ever-changing world that is found in no book he’s read. While Kazuya was someone that was kind and honest by nature and was someone that possessed guile and intelligence in equal measure he was not someone that believed that his view should be expressed via forceful means unlike his erstwhile neighbor&#039;s in the principality of Amidonia preferring instead to be open with his people and listening to their concerns and discerning measures that can be used to help them overcome both their short term problems but also address it in the long term as well an act that is best shown in him trading their national treasures to repay their debt to the empire and the televised address to the people where he set about outlining his plans and asking for any who think that their innate skills may be useful to join him. This sense of openness for a newly crowned king while doing well in showing his humility and determination to change matters also showed well to the people that young as he is perhaps Kazuya was someone that they can finally place their whole trust in after years of having an ineffective king at the helm. In my eyes this speech while serving as an excellent means to introduce himself to the people also showed well Kazuya’s skill at foresight as he had correctly predicted that while his plans will go a long way in improving the kingdom he cannot do so without the willing support of his people and only with their blessing would he be able to change their lives an aspect that I really admired about him. <br />
<br />
While the business of running a country even with a staff of handpicked retainers was certainly a daunting task that involved making some heavy decisions both domestically and internationally Kazuya nonetheless was someone that had a more empathic side to him and while not shown often was quite capable of expressing strong feelings openly as shown in the sense of regret, devastation and sadness that he expressed on seeing the impact of the landslide on the dark elves village a side of him that I felt made him more human and relatable as few rulers would spare thoughts for such minor events. While the negative feelings expressed above showcased well his desire to protect the people from all manner of threats Kazuya was also someone that had a surprisingly fun sense of humor within him that he used to excellent effect both to inform the people of new developments but also in showcasing his own creations as shown in the cooking program in ep4 a development that while doing well in creating new food items also showed to them that their king wasn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty when it came to solving the food shortages aspects that were complemented greatly by Kazuya’s friendly, easy-going and optimistic nature. While the event itself was certainly one that had a functional goal in mind, I felt that they also served to allow the characters to have some fun, unwind and bring some welcome comedy to both them and us something that I felt was accomplished quite readily.<br />
<br />
Overall, as a character Kazuya Souma I felt was an excellent one that while possessing neither skill with blade or magic was one that was able to take to the new role of being king easily via both the recruitment of skilled subordinates as well as his own innate intelligence, knowledge and cunning that allowed him to not only overcome fearsome odds with not brawn but rather with words, ideas, plans and budgets that showed the world that one does not need to be a despot to make their country strong. One that rules with a firm but gentle hand that takes and considers the advice of his most trusted subordinates while always thinking of the people can also create a country that’s strong and united. His development from freshly summoned hero to king I felt while making effective usage of his intelligence and ability to adapt to given situations quickly also in my opinion served to streamline the overall narrative which within the genre often gets itself slowed due to the need for the mc to realize this is a new world whereas in this case Kazuya simply took it in stride and dealt with one thing at a time. After his lengthy stint as Subaru in Re Zero it&#039;s nice to see Yusuke Kobayashi portray a character that while similar to Subaru was someone that can be said to be the total opposite of him in both temperament, maturity and ability to think long term.  <br />

Liscia <br />

Liscia Elfriden portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and A Place Further than the universe fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the primary heroines within the series. The sole daughter of the former king and queen of Elfriden and its former princess Liscia from her initial appearances was shown to be a confident, kind and honest person by nature that nonetheless also possessed a surprisingly fiery and haughty side to her that I felt complimented her character well. As a former member of the kingdom’s royalty Liscia was someone that while polite and courteous was one that trusted others warily and as a result of her fiery nature tended to misunderstand situations and the intents of others as shown in her first encounters with Kazuya who she viewed as a cheater or fraud that had usurped her father’s role. <br />
<br />
However, beneath the surface, Liscia can be seen to be someone that while wary of outsiders and those that haven’t proved themselves to her was one that appreciated hard work and results that have been earned from it and was shown to be very loyal towards those that have earned her trust. While Liscia at the beginning of the series was shown to be somewhat of an idealist that believed perhaps too strongly in the belief that age-old traditions should be maintained, when possible, she was someone that was shown to be rather adaptable with her thinking when sufficient facts are shown to her. Though Liscia’s fiery and stubborn nature can often make people think that she’s a difficult person to interact with Liscia beneath her base nature was actually someone that was honest and caring by nature and was quite capable of reflecting upon her judgement and apologizing when needed a fact that I felt really served to complement her character’s desire to find the best way possible to rebuild her country by allying with Kazuya a person though she suspected as a fraud at first soon become the shining beacon that they needed to help her beloved home. <br />
<br />
As a character Liscia I felt was an interesting character that was designed and developed relatively well as the series progressed. While Liscia’s first encounter with Kazuya was not the most pleasant experience for either of them Liscia’s innate qualities of being a stubborn and fiery yet intelligent and rational person over the course of the series served to establish her as not a princess but a dear friend and confidant for Kazuya that was always on hand to give him not only practical advice on the world but also emotional and combat support when needed. While her knowledge of how an economy works and how these will affect the kingdom’s people is not as refined as those of Kazuya her ability to self-reflect and expand upon ideas that have been proposed allowed her to not only keep in sync with Kazuya relatively easily but also served to keep him grounded as a person a relationship that I felt served to remind us that while being a king is a hard role it will be even harder if you did not have someone that you can be frank with in both your feelings and your plans to rebuild the land a role that Liscia managed to fulfil excellently. <br />

Animation wise I felt that the animation used within the series was not only clear and detailed but also made great use of colour and environmental variety within its settings. Character design-wise while the series featured your standard variety of humans and elves or in this case the dark elves it also featured some interesting races that were unique to the series such as the Lion Beastman, Sea Serpent, Dragonnewt and Mystic wolves all of which featured designs that I felt while making them all unique in terms of race qualities also served to expand upon the lore of the kingdom as well with each of their traits serving to enhance each of the respective military branches and giving each a unique capability when their service is required as was demonstrated by the air force during their relief of the forbidden army . While the number of locations that the cast visit throughout the series wasn’t especially large by any means the ones that were featured I felt served to showcase well not only the reason for Kazuya’s reforms but also showcase the kind of division that existed within the kingdom even before his arrival and appointment as king as shown in the abundant cotton fields who are unable to sell because of supply exceeding demand, the tired and hungry civilians across the land who aren’t getting supplies due to inadequate road networks and lastly the decentralized military whose cities and domains while impressive in scale did nothing to help the kingdoms people and whose independence while itself initially a safety measure ended up causing issues with chain of command when their strength was needed the most. While the locations shown were indeed few the impact that they had allowing us to see how dire things were within the kingdom were certainly more than enough. <br />
<br />
Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hello Horizon that was performed by Liscia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase and Kazanear that was performed by Aimi who portrayed the character of Carla. Both of these songs while excellent ones served to represent different emotions and feelings when used in conjunction with their accompanying visuals with the former being able to inject a level of tension within it as it introduced not only how divided the continent of Landia was but also how tough of a job Kazuya and his trusted allies have as they set about rebuilding Elfrieden when faced against the might of hostile nations and ambitious warriors and dukes that are determined to take advantage of the new reality being presented to them. On the other hand, the ending theme can be said to have the opposite effect in that it conveyed the feelings of hope, determination and a desire to forge a new path and future for your people by implementing change without compromising one’s own values and morals a contrast that I felt complimented both the series central theme and the feelings conveyed by the opening. <br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall, the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase who portrayed the main leads did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Kazuya Souma and Liscia Elfriden whose character chemistry really served to make them a delight to see on screen. Backing them up were a host of talented seiyuu’s who did well both to support them in their endeavors or frustrating them as their opponents with notable ones being Ikumi Hasegawa whose portrayal of the powerful but surprisingly gluttonous dark elf Aisha was as inspiring as it was amusing, Reina Ueda whose portrayal of the beautiful and graceful angel Juna was as elegant as it was awe-inspiring on account of her ability to combine her singing talent with mc and her duties as an advisor and lastly the trinity of dukes of Excel Walter, Castor Vargas and Georg Carmine who were portrayed by veteran seiyuu’s Yui Horie, Jun Fukuyama and Taiten Kusonoki who managed to convey into their characters a level of maturity, stubbornness and a desire to test Kazuya Souma’s mettle of king that served to make them formidable obstacles for him in the first days of the rebuilding and really make him pull out all the stops needed to overcome them. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall I felt that How a Realist Hero rebuilt The kingdom was an excellent anime that had among its main strengths an interesting premise, narrative, excellent characters that were both well designed and developed, stellar voice acting and creative problems that had to be addressed by the cast all of which served to introduce a welcome change to the Isekai genre by creating a tale in which the hero solves problems via intelligence, knowledge, words and creativity rather than with swords or magic a change that I felt served as an additional reason for this series popularity. <br />
<br />
While the Isekai genre despite being one that has been in existence for just over 2 decades continues to move from strength to strength its focus in providing narratives that are easily relatable to its intended audience of teenagers have in my opinion started to make animes of this genre somewhat predictable in its ideas. However, in the case of Realist the series while having the standard trappings of the genre represented something of a unique case due to the fact that Kazuya did not take up the role of a combatant as most series of the genre would have but rather take up the role of an administrator or in Kazuya’s mind a caretaker king who would take up management of the kingdom of Elfrieden until a new and worthy king arrives to take over. Although Kazuya Souma was quite capable of taking upon the blade and becoming a warrior as many Isekai before it had done so with their mc’s the narratives decision to place him as a king who fought with words, plans and knowledge I felt really served to differentiate him while also allowing the usage of his impressive knowledge on economics and governance to full effect. While the series itself is indeed a relatively slow-paced series on account of its reliance on diplomacy and problem solving I felt that this resonated well with the overall goal of rebuilding the kingdom from the ground up that served to allow us a unique insight into the kind of goals and milestones that are necessary for the management of a kingdom that ranges from practical issues such as addressing food shortages, infrastructure, optimal crop placement and talent recruitment to more sensitive issues like liaising with the different races and social classes within the kingdom to inspire loyalty and unity against threats both internal and external. Though the reforms extensive as they were are not revolutionary by modern standards their implementation when combined with Kazuya’s skill at innovation proved to be both entertaining and a valuable lesson to learn as well a fact that was bolstered by the excellent usage of Kazuya’s skill at breaking apart complex knowledge into easily understood info that can be easily understood. <br />
<br />
Overall, how a Realist rebuilt the kingdom was an excellent anime that provided a fine balance of entertainment, tension, comedy, heartfelt bonding moments and a level of unpredictability in the form of Kazuya Souma’s reform plans that left me eagerly waiting to see each episode as a new week began. While there were admittedly characters that I felt were underused within the narrative that I wished could have seen more expansion overall the series’ adaptation from its source material I felt was a resounding success. Anime’s that require the cast to actually think and consider all angles of a problem are a rarity these days and I for one would like to see more of these types of animes over ones where violence and OP superpowers have become the norm. As a final score, I would say that it easily deserves a 9/10. <br />

    Once, I read a web novel called &quot;Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?&quot;. I didn&#039;t like it all that much. The pages were filled with endless lists of skills and stats which didn&#039;t really mean anything, and the action scenes made little sense to me. But somehow, last season&#039;s anime adaptation kept me entertained with an amazing voice acting performance by Aoi Yuuki and fun visuals. What I&#039;m trying to say is that an anime can be more than its source material. For Genkoku, this is not the case.<br />
<br />
MyAnimeList has a rather strict policy on spoilers, so I won&#039;t go into details. Suffice to say that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410865">
        none of the plot points, and I mean none, make any sense. When you watch the series and something happens, try to think about it for a few seconds, and you should see that something is fishy. All the social/economical/political parts of the series are incredibly lackluster and poorly thought out, which seems even worse when you realise that all problems are made specifically so that the MC can solve them in one sweeping motion. For every challenge that the protagonist faces, either the problem should not be a problem, or his solution should not work as a solution. <br />
   A piece of fiction can not be any smarter than its author, and despite trying very hard to be so, the author of Genkoku is not all that bright. This part of the show largely reminds me of &quot;Chōyoyū&quot;, another terrible adaptation of an equally bad light novel.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, the generic fantasy world that the protagonist finds himself isekai&#039;ed to is more devoid of any cultural identity than the half-naked girls sunbathing at your local beach. The style can somewhat vaguely be described as European, though that might be a bit of a stretch, as there is almost nothing to build that statement on. Worldbuilding is one of the most important parts of high fantasy, and it has seemingly been neglegted in favor of what can only be described as pseudo-intellectual nonsense.<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to write a little about the character interaction. Typically, most such interactions consist of people gushing about the absolute genius of a mastermind that is the protagonist. And would it really be an isekai if everyone didn&#039;t fall to their knees in complete awe of such brilliance?<br />
Well, whatever, we&#039;ve seen this trope a thousand times before. <br />
   What I want to write about specifically is what ultimately made me drop the series at episode 5. I don&#039;t want to spoil, so I won&#039;t go into details, but in the span of about 5 minutes, the MC and his friends call a member of his harem ugly and disappointing several times. This happens completely unprovoked. The only apparent reason for this bullying is that she doesn&#039;t fit into their racial steriotypes.<br />
   Is this what the author thinks counts for dialogue? Is it supposed to be funny? Maybe I just don&#039;t understand the joke, but if this is what the character interaction is going to be like, that&#039;s a hard pass for me.<br />
<br />

    The art, the sound is not that bad. However, it really is the story and the characters that made me hate this anime. The &quot;reforms&quot; (to be honest I&#039;m really being nice considering them as reforms) taken by the hero is completely BS and it really is a wonder how he isn&#039;t dead yet. Let me expand on that point: how he governed the kingdom is child&#039;s play. Starting a complete reform when you literally just took power? And without any base of support? Your reforms threatened the conservative party&#039;s interests, and yet they do nothing about it? Like seriously, if removing political opponents are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415838">
        as simple as portrayed by this anime, then the US would become an authoritarian state already.<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, this anime would have been fine without the title. I would judge it as another isekai-hero-kingdom-building anime, yet the author had to put the word &quot;realist&quot; in it. The author clearly knows nothing about politics and had never learned any history. Just refer to the Hundred Days Reform and New Policies Song Reform (search it on Wikipedia or google) as an example of a reform that failed miserably<br />
<br />
Anyways this is just my personal opinion, take it for reference only.<br />
(As of writing this, I dropped the anime after watching 7 episodes, but given how the plot has progressed, I doubt it gets more &quot;realistic&quot; in episodes after)

    This is an anime that promises one thing then delivers another. Don&#039;t be fooled by the nation-builder premise; it&#039;s quickly evident after 3 or 4 episodes that this anime is mostly fantasy slice of life, and aside from a brief 2-episode story arc it stays this way throughout the whole series. That combined with an incredible amount of talking head scenes left me incredibly disappointed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The overarching plot is fine, and follows the premise of a man transported into a fantasy world and using his earth knowledge to help improve the kingdom. However this really only happens in the background. He declares that he will do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418389">
        one thing, and then the anime shows some filler scenes of people scribbling on sheets with pens and such, then two episodes later we all find out it worked to perfection. What happens in the middle? Things like putting on a cooking show, going out on a date, taking acquired fox-daughter shopping, and going on a dungeon raid in a body double are actual things that happen in this anime and take the majority of some episodes, often spanning multiple episodes. Sometimes they are plot related or lead into plot, but they last for so long and drag on so slowly that when the plot goes back on course it&#039;s jarring. There&#039;s a nice arc of two-to-three episodes towards the end that actually sticks with the premise throughout the entire arc, which is refreshing, but this is the exception, not the norm.<br />
<br />
Art is lackluster. It&#039;s pretty evident this is low budget. Not only that but the vast majority of this anime is talking heads in front of bland backgrounds so it is very visually dull. The few action scenes were okay but in line with what you&#039;d expect from a low budget adaptation. Sound is fine; the voice acting is actually pretty good but the music is reused repeatedly and gets old. You don&#039;t notice much else in the sound department because of (again) most of this anime being talking head pieces.<br />
<br />
A big irritation that quickly developed for me is that the main character is incredibly dull looking. The outfit he comes in - blue slacks, a white button down shirt, an open blue sweater - is the one that he wears in *the entire series*. This guy is a king and he literally sits in a throne talking to subjects like he just came out of a sale at Target. What&#039;s disappointing is that you see him wearing a slick military style fantasy outfit in the thumbnail but he only wears that in like one episode then quickly returns to his thrift store outfit. That combined with a head that could be literally any isekai protagonist combines to make something very uninspired and boring, and frankly something that does not belong in a fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Other characters are actually pretty visually interesting and varied in their designs in contrast to the main. Each character has their own color palette, their voice actors nail their roles, and they fit great with their setting. However character growth is not a thing in this anime, and what characters we get are pretty one dimensional. <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this? Eh? I don&#039;t know. This show doesn&#039;t leave you with any lasting impact, but it&#039;s a nice time filler I suppose. That leads into my massive disappointment though, because I expected more out of a plot which was actually consistent and interesting but really only takes up about 20% of the airtime. If you come into this anime with the same expectations I had, for a nation builder with an isekai hook, you will be frustrated with this plot&#039;s potential. Adjust your expectations carefully before watching this.

    Good title, good concept. But man, why did I expect so much from another isekai? Because the synopsis told me otherwise, it told me that it would be a great isekai about a guy fixing the problems via administration, not adventures nor fights like your average hero.<br />
God, why did it have to be like this. I really wish I hadn&#039;t found this show so that I didn&#039;t get extremely disappointed by it.<br />
The story is interesting at the start, but it quickly becomes a garbage show once their talented people showed up. The very existence of them ruined it all. <br />
Basically, the hero is summoned to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410102">
        support the forces that are trying to defeat the demons that appeared out of nowhere. But the hero refuses to go on adventures or turn himself in to the empire and tries to fix the bad financial state of the current nation he&#039;s in. Sounds good and original, right? Yes, but he won&#039;t do anything that will surprise you. I had insatiable expectations about this show and maybe you did too. Personally, I was anticipating some sort of modernization and economical, social and political boosts. Though, of course, none of them will become true in this show, and if it happens, it wouldn&#039;t be remotely close to what I was expecting. You may ask yourself, why and how do you know that? Well, as I stated previously, Poncho. This characters in the show gave me all the information that I needed to know about the entire show, mainly Poncho. 0 engineers between the talented, so no modernization; people are surprised that some of the food that Poncho cooked are edible, so it is probably going to be a boring cooking show; and don&#039;t even mention it, I can forsee it&#039;s a harem because the females already show the predictable signs of interest of love in the protagonist.<br />
I just wrote a needlessly long text wall because of my huge disappointment, epic.<br />
My rating so far is 1/10. I hope none of my predictions come true, I really do.

    A good idea, a poor execution.<br />
<br />
Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki is plagued by poor pacing.<br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t know, pacing is one of the most important things in this medium.<br />
When adapting a series or movie, be it live or animated you are going to have to cut stuff out or adapt the plot, it&#039;s one of the hardest things to do and some fans of the original source will be unhappy no matter what, I haven&#039;t read the source material but it&#039;s clear to me that the choices made of what to cut are... debatable at least.<br />
<br />
There is romance, I am fine with it,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review418465">
        it&#039;s integral part of the story and enhances the plot, or at least it should, it doesn&#039;t, it steals screen time from the main plot, the issue with the series is that too much time is given to the building of these relations, with the main plot dragging on because more than half of the episode is given to the romance, if at least that plot went forward it would be more forgivable, but it doesn&#039;t, a good chunk of that subplot is skippable, where nothing noteworthy happens.<br />
<br />
So now we come to the main story, as I already said it moves slowly, the plot itself and idea behind it is fascinating and has real potential, which makes it even the more tragic for me. The protagonist is put on charge of a nation plagues by issues and threats, our hero must lead the nation out of this sinkhole. The plot revolves around political decisions and reforms and the fallout of those decisions, again great premise, but since the subpar romance takes the lead in the series we don&#039;t see much of it, instead of being shown the progress made by the protagonist we are often told it happened off-screen and we don&#039;t hear anything from those particular issues anymore, they are dealt with, the end. This is, again, thanks to the fact that the building of romance and friendship took the lead, thus important stuff is skipped, so we can have an episode dedicated to our MC day off.<br />
We also see very little in the way of international politics and relations, only at the end of the season we see a little, and the season ends before we can really see anything getting done due to the pacing.<br />
While I really enjoy the idea of the anime and would love to see how the MAIN plot progresses I don&#039;t think I would waste my time watching a second season after a first one that went nowhere.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day I give the story a 4, great potential in the main plot, forgettable romance subplot and bad pacing. Due to the wasted potential tho, I find it even more frustrating, enjoyment is thus, only a 3.<br />
<br />
Characters: Better than average, they aren&#039;t completely stupid, like in most anime, they have flaws but are intelligent, capable of making not asinine decisions, which is refreshing and doesn&#039;t break my sense of immersion like most anime, at the same they aren&#039;t anything to write home about, I haven&#039;t found anything particularly unique or outstanding about them, may be because they spend more time talking about food and praising the MC rather than doing anything noteworthy, very little development in anything but the romance. Again above average, I give it a 7.<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Both average and forgettable.<br />
<br />
Overall 5: Wasted opportunity, boring.

    I always have high hopes for animes from the ISEKAI genre and the first episode of this anime convinced me that it has the potentials to be another good isekai anime. But after three more episodes, the plot became super mediocre with no twist or plot development. <br />
This anime feels like an elementary school where your teacher explains basic concepts of the world in the most basic ways possible but you still become impressed as those things are completely new to you. Character development is also at its worst. <br />
This is an anime made for adults with childish content which will even bore children. <br />
Totally

    A realistic Isekai OMG.  Is that even possible?<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a charismatic hero given godlike powers facing untold dangers and adventures to defeat evil and maniacal enemies bent on world destruction while saving a beautiful and well endowed princess, don&#039;t look here.  <br />
<br />
If you are looking for something completely different from all other isekais that you have watched before, than you have come to the right place.<br />
<br />
The story itself is not typical and overdone, which makes it fun and interesting to watch. There is no transformation into an other worldly creature that learns to survive and thrive in a new world.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410263">
         Nor is it a ordinary person brought into a strange world to save it.  Well it is that, but the &quot;Hero&quot; decides to go against the norm and actually save the kingdom not by fighting the &quot;Demon horde&quot; but by actually fixing what is wrong with the kingdom.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s a twist.<br />
<br />
The art is above standard and goes well with the story line and character design.<br />
<br />
Sound quality is also good and works well.<br />
<br />
The characters are developed nicely.  Each having a distinct personality and endearing quality.  Effort was actually put into the side characters.  Even the one liners. <br />
<br />
So far this is definitely in my top ten favorite isekai anime and if it continues in this way it will be in my top 50 must see anime.<br />
<br />
Overall I look forward to each episode. Wondering what could possibly be next.<br />
<br />
This is a must see for Isekai fans.

    Let&#039;s keep this short...<br />
<br />
For a show that is ostensibly about realism, it is ridiculously idealistic.<br />
<br />
If idealistic fantasizing is your thing, this show might speak to you. But it doesn&#039;t speak to me. To paraphrase a line near the end, &quot;this show and I are like oil and water.&quot; Initially, I was fairly optimistic. The main character does appear to act like a realist insofar as he tries to accept situations are they are and deal with them accordingly. However, this realism is quickly undercut by the idealistic way in which events occur and play out. There is no exploration of grey areas and morality. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421248">
        viewer is presented shallow, black and white interpretations of problems that are resolved with unrealistic ease that often came across to me as almost hyper-nationalistic. In addition to this and as is usually the case with harem anime, the show exists as a male power fantasy. Regardless of one&#039;s opinion of harem as a genre, however, it is undeniable that the harem genre is inherently unrealistic. The whole point of harem is that it is an idealistic, sexual fantasy.<br />
<br />
I rate this show a 2 because it is still better than a lot of the other isekai cookie cutters and as a result I was actually able to finish it. But it&#039;s a far cry from what I was hoping it would be.<br />
