Story: 8<br />
Now some of you have heard that time is considered part of the fourth dimension, but what if you were told that there is a dimension that contains all of the possibilities in the world? This is basically what the story is based on.<br />
<br />
The anime does not explain the mechanics of Dimension W too deeply, but it explores it enough to give us an understanding of what it&#039;s trying to convey, such as when coils go haywire and Dimension W manifests in the real world, or when the characters are able to enter Dimension W

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214525">
        and see all the possibilities. However, the actual use of Dimension W is a bit superficial outside of that. Everything just mainly revolves around coils and the &#039;possibilities&#039; get shoved back as more of a nominal thing. So in the end the actual usage and exploration of &#039;possibilities&#039; was a bit minimal, and may have become more of just a theme to a battle story with some cute moments.<br />
<br />
And as good as the combat was, it seemed a little odd at times. Mabuchi seems to just freely throw out however many dart things as he likes, while being able to wire them so he can perform spiderman or AOT style swings and climbs as he wishes, along with the fact that they can also act as some sort of snare. There wasn&#039;t any moment where he ran out of darts or was in any particular danger due to his choice of weaponry which kind of made him a bit of an immortal god of sorts. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
In regards to the art, it was very well done, especially the characters. They stood out well and were designed quite differently. Mira was consistently cute, Mabuchi maintained his gruffness, Loser maintained his enigma while Lasithi was designed quite sexily. The use of colour was appropriate to the moment, though backgrounds would occasionally look quite bland.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
As for the characters, I did want to give it a 10, but the only thing that ruined it was the main antagonist, Haruka Seameyer. He was just a little too cliched with his insanity and cruelty. He just didn&#039;t feel unique enough as an antagonist for me to really be drawn to him and to actually hate him for his existence (like Joffrey in Game of Thrones). <br />
However, setting aside the antagonist, Mabuchi Kyoma is quite the likeable character. He&#039;s strong and independent (not clinging to friendship nonsense), and has a cool attitude but with a sad history. <br />
Whilst Mira is the lovable female MC who&#039;s a robot with a full human personality. She cries, blushes, and even expresses pain. She&#039;s funny, cute and most of all, has a consistent character. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The voice acting in this was also great. Mabuchi has a cool, deep and slightly apathetic voice that suits the character and helps set him apart from everyone else, while Mira has an appropriately feminine and cutesy voice which greatly complements the character. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Overall, I really liked this show. Maybe I&#039;m biased towards shows that can have a consistently cute girl and who isn&#039;t annoying or out of place. Mira is not your damsel in distress, but an actual partner to Mabuchi, which I feel really helped with me giving this show such a high score. And I definitely hope to hear more of her voice in future titles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Some further spoilers and personal inputs on what could have made this show even greater*<br />
<br />
There was a line in the last few episodes that really helped bring the logic of the world and the coils together, which was: &quot;Possibilities can be predicted and explained but not observed, that is because once it is observed, it is no longer the possibility but the result. I.e. Schrodinger&#039;s cat.&quot; or something to that effect. <br />
This line alone is what could have made this show all the more interesting. Somehow manipulating Dimension W to bring about a favoured possibility which results in the defeat of the final boss. Maybe the anime studio ran out of time, maybe the author just wasn&#039;t ready for such a complex story. They had the opportunity to utilise it through Genesis, but ultimately removed it by &#039;destroying&#039; Genesis.<br />
Without actually exploring the fundamental concept of possibilities which links the entire story together, the show was prevented from being unique and instead became another battle story with just a different theme, much like Bleach, Naruto or Fairy Tail.

    Watching Dimension W makes me feel a bit like my childhood days. I’d watch some random anime on TV with my friends on Toonami and we’d make jokes about the story, characters, artwork, and every other funny thing going on. Dimension W isn’t a funny story but it does have the feel of a show that’s aimed at the Western audience. And furthermore, it takes place in a fictional world in the future so there’s tons of potential. Dimension W capitalizes on those potentials and makes this show not just fun but an insightful experience.<br />
<br />
Calling Dimension W another stereotypical sci-fi action flick would be injustice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214347">
        as the series explores quite a bit based on its premise. The show is directed by Kanta Kamei with Aketagawa Jin as the sound producer and produced by Studio 3Hz and Orange. It’s noticeable that Funimation is the co-committee of this series as well to bring their talent into the mix. For those who have seen Darker than Black, you may find the show has a familiar vibe in terms of character design. The interesting part is how Dimension W focuses on its own story and despite not being too refreshing for its ideas, it’s very a high dose of popcorn entertainment.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in a fictional world in the future. By 2071, humanity began using a source of energy that can last forever for their planet. Through influence of the fourth dimension, they are able to harness energy in the form of objects known as “coils”.  Coils are manufactured by New Tesla, an energy company that uses them for profit. However, they also private firms and groups that uses illegal coils for their own purposes. The show introduces Kyouma, a collector who has a hatred for coils. His adventures takes him to all sort of places including his meeting with a peculiar robot girl, Mira. Get the picture here? Any fan of sci-fi should feel intrigued because of the amount of world building with the show. Indeed, Dimension W does a good job by building up its fictional world and constructing it concepts with interesting details. The imaginary setting of Dimension W introduces many concepts including its rich history, society, and technological advancements. As such, getting into this show allows the viewers to appreciate the ideas of the creator.<br />
<br />
In general, the plot is about Kyouma, a collector who despises coils. There’s actually a credible reason for this as explored in later episodes through background storytelling. His encounter with Mira is a bit odd however. Essentially and for most of the series, he is indifferent about her presence and often calls her names like “junk” and “useless robot”. Despite that, there’s a growing chemistry between the two. Mira is also a character that will spark interest because of her very human behavior. She is a robot but displays a lot of personality as if she is an ordinary girl. Throughout the show, we can see that she wants to help people and her partnership with Kyouma leads her to do selfless deeds. Kyouma is portrayed more as the guy who wants to get the job done and lives life like a simple man with a love for vintage cars but hate for coils. His fighting skills is fairly impressive and is able to fight on par with cyborgs, coil enhanced mechanisms, and even multiple enemies at once. Add a bit of his driving skills and it’s easy to see that Kyouma is the badass everyman. <br />
<br />
When watching the show, I noticed some trends about the plot structure. It focuses on society and explores Kyouma’s daily adventures. At first, some of his cases really shows more than what he does in everyday life. However, subsequent episodes introduces other ways at how Dimension W’s world works. There’s also murder mystery, cyber-punk themes, and how events from the past connects with the story in the present. The show also introduce Numbers and their presence really exposes the dangers of coils. Background storytelling is also incorporated into the show that explores Kyouma and other characters’ pasts. Unfortunately, the series is only one cour of 12 episodes while the manga has at least 9 volumes. Get the idea? Expect a lot of cuts with certain side characters and certain rush of the story to get to specific arcs. Characters like Elizabeth, Albert, and other many of the minor villains get some spotlights but not much characterization. As one of the downsides, Dimension W’s adaptation content may be a disappointment for manga fans. <br />
<br />
Despite that, I think the show is still very entertaining for its characters. Then, there’s a lot about the Dimension W universe that is intriguing. We get to see how androids interact, the world fiction of Dimension W’s technological aspects (coils, numbers, machinery, etc), and the show even has some pretty solid action. Kyouma’s a legitimate badass and he has little patience for evildoers. Similarly, the show has both a comedic and serious feel. The comedic moments are timed right especially through the interactions between Kyouma and Mira. In addition, the series rarely tries to exploit its shock values to entertain the fans but rather with its own merits. <br />
<br />
The art style of Dimension W tends to have a very scientific feel. Character designs are also neat and will remind anyone of Darker than Black. Kyouma reminds me of a lone wolf detective and bounty hunter that came out of a classic movie. Meanwhile, Mira has the appearance of a young girl with robotic characteristics. (see that cute little mechanical tail?) The sci-fi backgrounds and technology also looks credible and advanced enough to be set in its timeline. The gadgets of the show and other robotic designs have a fair amount of details to further make its world building look believable. There’s even a bit of artistic enhancement with creative shade coloring at many noticeable scenes. Fan service is fairly minimal although there are a few times when the camera likes to shine on Mira. The real fan service is the action delivered right to your face.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is solid especially when Kyouma is on a mission involving him collecting illegal coils. It’s eerie, energetic, and portrays science fiction with theatrics. In addition, I appreciate how Kyouma’s voice sounds as a mature adult rather than some kid out of high school. On the other hand, Mira’s voice can sound a bit bratty so fans will have to get used to that. Luckily, you will be rewarded with the very creative OP song. Performed by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, it’s very colorful with the dancing, full throttle action, and creative coloring. OST and music is just as impressive and shows that the creators cares a lot about their work.<br />
<br />
Dimension W is a show that I think anyone can watch with something to talk about towards the end. Whether it’s the world building, storytelling, characterization, or technical art/music/soundtrack style, the show is a lot of fun. It lives up to what it tries to do despite cutting content from the original manga. As most series in modern years, it’s not very original and still borrows a lot of ideas from other sci-fi works. However, Dimension W still embraces the sci-fi genre and shows that it can be unique in its own way.<br />

    If there&#039;s one anime this season that went unnoticed, unhyped, and maybe even unfairly underrated, it&#039;s Dimension W. While not the flashiest, and certainly not the most outstanding anime- DimW has one thing going for it: it&#039;s original. Sidestepping the trappings and tropes that seem to permeate modern anime, and instead embracing a groovy sci-fi near future with androids, flying cars, giant robots, and more- this one was a definite breath of fresh air. <br />
<br />
Produced by Studio 3Hz, apparently a very new studio, with literally one credit to their name, the animation and art aren&#039;t anything special, but neither are they completely uninspired. It&#039;s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214793">
        bit on the low budget side compared to some modern shows, but fluid and frenetic action coupled with some stylized CG made it very watchable. Similarly, voice acting is handled competently, and the music fits well, adding accents or enhancement to the mood when necessary.<br />
<br />
The nearly infinite, but unstable energy source that the show is named for takes a front and center position in the plot- weaving a narrative around the creation of &quot;coils&quot;, which as essentially batteries that can access the 4th dimension, a plane of existence where possibility is endless, and is tapped into as a source of energy. Everything takes coils: the robots, cars, computers, and nearly the entire world run on this limitless supply of energy.<br />
Kyouma Mabuchi, our main character, is essentially a luddite in this techno world of Dimension W. He works essentially as a mercenary, collecting special types of highly unstable coils which can create massive rifts in space/time, and generally screw up everything, including sucking people into the energy black hole it forms. In return, he gets paid in things like gasoline (a scarce commodity in this future-world) and parts for his &quot;antique&quot; cars. <br />
Kyouma&#039;s dislike for coils, robots, and essentially anything technological puts him at odds with the technologically obsessed world he lives in- in a sort of &quot;born in the wrong generation&quot; way. His rugged, tough guy, and often rude demeanor are offputting to most people he meets, but he&#039;s dependable to get stuff done when it needs doing.<br />
<br />
The premise of the show is a fairly basic revenge tale, but this isn&#039;t immediately apparent, even through the first half of the show. The first section with Kyouma taking various jobs from his boss serves mostly as a semi-episodic adventure, introducing all the myriad characters, and then neatly segues into a long term plot. Without saying too much- there&#039;s a very collectible coil situated in a very dangerous area out in the Pacific ocean- one that is worth a lot of money, and none of the &quot;collectors&quot; (people like Kyouma who hunt coils for a living) can pass up. In a sort of &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; kind of way- this alluring prize on an island in an old lab turns out to be more dangerous than any of the collectors can handle. They gather, each with their own goals and reasons for doing so- whether to use the money to help a decimated country, for personal greed, revenge, or just to satisfy bloodthirst, and this sets the stage for a battle royale of wits and wills. At times though, the show seems to lose sight of what it was going for- getting sidetracked on what are seemingly one off adventures that mostly end in Kyouma questioning something about himself, but not actually creating any new development. <br />
<br />
The show has quite a large cast to be as short as it is, but this isn&#039;t all great, as many characters are relegated to first string bench warmer status, and play little to no role, especially later on. It does, however, do a fair job of returning to important moments from previous scenes, and wrapping things that seemed like dead ends up.<br />
<br />
Kyouma&#039;s motivation for his job and raison d&#039;etre are both explored at length. Finally, a show with a non-insert main character who actually has both tangible goals and reasons for why they do what they do. In his own angry-at-the-world way, Kyouma struggles against his inner demons, for love lost, his survivor&#039;s guilt, and the purpose of his continued existence in a world he no longer cares about. Cynical, hardened, and rather rage-filled, he makes for an interesting character who doesn&#039;t need anyone but himself, and honestly doesn&#039;t really care if people around him get hurt or killed. While not entirely heartless, he&#039;s a pretty cold and stoic character focused almost solely on his revenge. This isn&#039;t revealed immediately, but as we learn more about the character, we slowly begin to understand the obsession that eats at him.<br />
<br />
In finishing, Dimension W was a nice change of pace this season- with a very action oriented show that wasn&#039;t preachy or pretentious in presentation, satisfying, and most importantly: unique. It&#039;s not a mystery, and it&#039;s not a pure shonen battle- it&#039;s got just the right amount of spice to keep things interesting, moving, and fresh. I don&#039;t think there are too many anime that couldn&#039;t benefit from longer to flesh out their ideas and really explore characters and plots, but Dimension W is just about right at 12 episodes. Any less would have felt extremely rushed, and any more would have unnecessarily dragged it out. A shallow anime that&#039;s enjoyable enough? Sleeper anime of the season? That&#039;s for you to decide. <br />
<br />
As always, come rage at me, or say something nice. I don&#039;t care.

    Dimension W, definitely the best thing Studio 3Hz has made so far.<br />
Dimension W is a very episodic road trip-ish anime about a dude who is essentially a <br />
bounty hunter and a robot girl who gets stuck with him.<br />
Pretty standard setup for an action show with some fancy visuals.<br />
It&#039;s not without its flaws but if that sounded interesting to you it might be worth a watch.<br />
<br />
--Full review: minor spoilers ahead<br />
<br />
-Presentation(visuals &amp; sound)<br />
Dimension W has some well used CGI, though sometimes it can still stand out a bit too much.<br />
The backgrounds are well made, the CGI never felt choppy, and I like the character designs.<br />
I&#039;ve heard from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214355">
        some people that this is their favorite OP of the season, but it just sounded like pretty generic electro to me.<br />
Same thing with the ED, not saying they&#039;re bad but I&#039;ve heard better.<br />
Overall the animation is just very fluid, colorful and nice to look at.<br />
<br />
-Story<br />
Dimension W is very arch based and starts with what I would call a very bad first episode, it&#039;s essentially just a setup for the next episode.<br />
If you plan on giving Dimension W a go, then make sure you watch two episodes before deciding if you&#039;re going to complete it.<br />
The second episode is much stronger, and introduces one of the recurring characters, Loser (yes they actually call him that).<br />
There&#039;s one more episode that just felt like mostly boring info dumping, but that doesn&#039;t come until later on.<br />
And even with the info dumping by the characters this is how I understand the coils: wibbly wobbly timey wimey, realities inside of coils.<br />
<br />
Based on the premise I thought this show would comment on fossil fuel usage, but I didn&#039;t really hear much of that at all, for the better or worse.<br />
For the sake of explanation I&#039;m going to mention that the coils can essentially provide infinite energy, meaning they can do pretty much anything.<br />
The author clearly had fun with this, maybe a bit too much since sometimes it feels like whatever happens the author basically pulled out of his ass.<br />
Not that it matters too much since it&#039;s excused and explained and the story isn&#039;t super important here.<br />
<br />
One more gripe I have with the story is how the characters backstories are explained almost entirely in flashbacks, come on can&#039;t you figure out something more creative?<br />
Otherwise the story is interesting enough.<br />
The ending is conclusive enough, definitely not just a read the manga ending.<br />
<br />
-Characters<br />
Probably the best or the second best thing about the show, depending on how much you appreciate the animation.<br />
For once we don&#039;t have a completely bland main character, Mabuchi Kyouma is a person who dresses in traditional clothes and hates coils.<br />
Minor note that I don&#039;t particularly like the fact that Kyoma does his fighting with throwing knives, it tends to make for poor battle choreography.<br />
Though the choreography is still better than average.<br />
He has a fairly extensive backstory that I won&#039;t spoil.<br />
Yurizaki Mira is Kyoma&#039;s robot partner who is extremely strong and can detect coils.<br />
Their dynamic was quite fun to watch, and mira is also given an okay backstory.<br />
Other than that due to the Nature of the show there aren&#039;t that many interesting recurring characters aside from Loser<br />
But what is there is pretty good.<br />
<br />
-Overall<br />
It might sound a bit harsh to only give Dimension W a 6/10 but there are many shows just like it, and outside of the premise<br />
dimension W doesn&#039;t have much to distinguish itself with.<br />
And on top of that it wasn&#039;t really my type of a show to begin with.<br />
The narrative can feel a bit choppy at times.<br />
Characters didn&#039;t get much development because the show was busy just establishing them in 12 episodes.<br />
The visuals aren&#039;t without a few hiccups and the music used wasn&#039;t really my thing either.<br />
I could still recommend Dimension W to someone who likes futuristic action shows.

    Dimension W was billed as one of this season&#039;s shows with the potential to really appeal to a western audience. On the surface it does share some of the elements that tend to get a bit more attention from action-starved overseas fans. A cyberpunk setting, a sci-fi thriller plotline, and a no-nonsense masculine lead in Mabuchi Kyouma. The latter is a near-future Luddite. Dimension W is set in a world where everything is powered by devices called &#039;coils&#039; which tap into a hypothetical fourth dimension for unlimited energy. Kyouma despises the contraptions, symbolically driving a gasoline-fuelled car when the rest of the population has switched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215112">
        to electric vehicles. The coils are administered by an uber-powerful corporation called New Tesla, and yes, the very predictable routes of corporate corruption will be explored, beating that horse just a few more times as it barely wheezes a neigh. <br />
<br />
So the punchline is that Dimension W isn&#039;t that good, but how could an anime with such a cool setting be so mediocre? Well, let&#039;s start with the setting. It actually sucks. A few episodes start with a synopsis that pisses in the face of Albert Einstein, where dimension w is shown on a cartesian x-y-z graph as a line parallel and opposite to the x-axis. A keen observer might notice this is actually the negative-x axis, but the laziness doesn&#039;t end there (by the way, E=mc^2 is only the non-relativistic component). Apparently the energy from dimension negative-x is distributed amongst the populace via a network of 60 control towers, and that&#039;s not the only big number used to give an illusion of complexity where there is none. Also, apparently New Tesla just straight up murdered the wife and child of their most important inventor, and if there was an actually legitimate reason for this to be at all plausible, I&#039;ve completely forgot it.<br />
<br />
That important inventor, Professor Yurizaki, has developed a robot called Mira that mimics human emotions, who due to a series of goofy hijinks, teams up with Kyouma in his job to hunt illegal coils, which aren&#039;t regulated by Megagoogle. Her name is Mira and sure enough she&#039;s the best character is the series. Cute, while also having genuine agency in the story. The dynamic between her and Kyouma is great fun, so of course the more screen-time she gets, preferably along with Kyouma, the better this show turns out. Well, more than half of the series is taken up by Kyouma&#039;s character arc, where she spends a lot of time as a supporting role. Whoopsie!<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame in fact, because Dimension W starts off okay. As overwrought and uninspired as the setting is, it can at least serve as a template for some interesting episodic stories. That describes the first five episodes. The latter seven episodes comprise the aforementioned character arc, and boy if the series doesn&#039;t squander its potential in them. One thing I&#039;ve noticed with one-cour series is that they usually tend to do best when they focus on a cast of four or five key characters, while not getting too distracted by side characters that can be interesting but should nonetheless remain on the shelf most of the time. The alternative is having a good story, which at the moment is an ambitious expectation.<br />
<br />
The last half of this series does neither. Many different parties participate in a search for a macguffin, and so the focus of the plot is immediately split between the motivations and backstories of these parties. This is such a waste of time, when time is of the essence in the one-cour format. Do you care about the stereotypical African prince, or the mysterious phantom thief Loser, or the downtrodden villain who&#039;s shoehorned into the plot out of nowhere? Of course not, but Dimension W shoves every hackneyed detail of these characters down your gullet.<br />
<br />
Granted, if the series kept up the episodic structure, it still wouldn&#039;t be good. The underlying flaws in the setting preclude any attempt to really take itself seriously. But it would have at least had variety going for it. Alas, this show is simply following the broad structure of the manga. <br />
<br />
At least it looks good. The character designs are on point and blend in well with the style of the backgrounds. Both use a fairly wide color palette that is tamed by avoiding over-saturation. The quality of the drawings doesn&#039;t deteriorate much, and the animation quality is above average, although the CG robots are as unwelcome as ever. Wait for Flip Flappers for an exhibition of what Studio 3Hz may really be capable of.<br />
<br />
So ultimately, Dimension W was just boring. Its source material is crap and it doesn&#039;t make any effort to spice it up.

    It started off as a fresh anime with cosplay worthy characters (robot girl is the only good character honestly) The opening and ending song and art were really enjoyable, i didn&#039;t skip any of it. <br />
<br />
But here is the tricky part of all science fiction series/film/etc, you need to be able to explain stuff logically  and the explanation should be satisfying (even if it is just made up for the sake of fiction) just claiming that everthing worked with coils that got the energy from dimension w is a very poor explanation about what the f_ was going on throughout this series. <br />
<br />
The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214507">
        and events were hard to follow at one point, as everthing was everywhere. The nemesis was presented and written poorly. <br />
<br />
The best I can say for this series, it started off with lots of potential and I was hyped and excited to see the next episodes, a few weeks ago. It&#039;s an illusion though, this series presents nothing new, just re-introduces tropes from around the anime/manga industry. I haven&#039;t read the manga, and after finishing the anime adaptation, I don&#039;t think I ever will.<br />

    I&#039;m mixed about Dimension W. Should you watch this show. Check this review to find out.<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
- Opening and ED themes (Kyouma dancing and Mira being a waifu. Nuff said)<br />
- Stellar animation<br />
- Good OST (shout out to my boys , STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION for that opening tho)<br />
- Marvelous Action<br />
- Very interesting sci-fi premise<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
- Uninspiring plot<br />
- Substandard character development <br />
- Kyouma and Mira&#039;s relationship (When will Kyouma stop hitting Mira and callling her trash, I mean thats his character but it got annoying real quick. Who in their right mind wants to abuse that adorable robot (ಥ﹏ಥ) )<br />
- Terrible Villains<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I don&#039;t know if i enjoyed Dimension

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214662">
        W too be honest. It started out hype af (especially because of that opening) but then after about episode 5, I felt the show&#039;s plot dragged on and became predictable. I felt I was being forced to watch it every Sunday. Hey, but don&#039;t let my thoughts dismay you. Check it out yourself and make your own opinion!<br />
<br />
<br />
Give it a 4 episode rule<br />
<br />

    The story of Dimension W takes place in a world where humanity has attained unlimited energy, reshaping the foundation of our daily lives, raising the bar for what is possible for us to achieve. With an interesting premise and the promise of sci-fi action the anime catches your eye easily.<br />
<br />
The artwork of the series remains flashy and slightly stylized through the whole experience, even when it obviously cuts a few corners. Sometimes the backgrounds will vanish for example, but rather than hide it, Dimension W makes it their greeting card, turning a weakness into a recognizable trait.<br />
<br />
Sadly enough, when I reached the end of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214421">
        series, I couldn&#039;t help but feel it ended up a mess. At some point, the series simply lost focus and fell under the pressure of its own potential. What I mean by that is that the setting, story, and characters, are being pulled in so many directions that you can&#039;t get a sense of what it wants to be. It lays out its premise very clearly - &#039;What if humanity had unlimited energy?&#039; - yet it never focuses on exploring this concept. Instead it brings in tropes from countless other animes and classic stories, and then tries to push it all into a blender. Examples would include the master thief that announces where he&#039;ll strike next, and ghosts living at a mysterious rural mansion. Neither of those examples seem to fit into a sci-fi setting.<br />
<br />
I was very happy to see some actual variety in the cast, showing a wide array of personalities, backgrounds, and nationalities. It&#039;s not every day that you see African characters portrayed in anime, and on top of it, playing roles that are important to the story. The show manages to make the world seem connected by doing this.<br />
<br />
But what about our main leads? First there is Kyoma, the brooding version of Sakata Gintoki, a veteran soldier who&#039;s haunted by his past and refuses to fight with modern weaponry. Secondly there is Mira, the sexier version of Pinocchio, the robot with a heart of gold that looks at the world like a naïve child. They form a dynamic duo that&#039;s fun to watch, but since the anime doesn&#039;t have time to delve too deep into them there is still a lot of untapped potential.<br />
<br />
To summarize, Dimension W is a series that will disappoint those who are looking for a strict sci-fi story, but might just barely entertain those who just want a bit of action.

    I binged watched Dimension W for 2 days while waiting for episode 12 to air. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Dimension W. Here are some of the reasons.<br />
<br />
Story (8): What I loved about Dimension W is that it is engaging and leaves you wanting more and more. You want to know what happens in every twist and turn and in a way, you wish that it could go on and on. I did not like however that it felt entirely inconclusive and that the ending seemed lacking, at least for me.<br />
<br />
Art (9): Bandai Visual is one of the best production houses, in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215005">
        my opinion and the art for Dimension W was colorful, despite the darkness of its theme. The animation was also really stunning and the fight scenes are engaging. It&#039;s not overwhelming to look at and the characters, both protagonists, supporting characters and villains, seem distinct. <br />
<br />
Sound (9): I really give much credit for the opening and ending themes for the score I&#039;m giving this category because they are amazing. I loved the opening theme and of course animation. It definitely brought me back to my love of Gangsta. The ending was just adorable. The sound in the show itself wasn&#039;t necessarily up there but it blended in nicely with the plot.<br />
<br />
Character (8): What&#039;s so great about the characters of Dimension W is that they don&#039;t beg to be liked, well maybe except for Mira, who you need to like because cmon that face. Anyway, the characters are not waiting for you to love them because they are stereotypically lovable. They aren&#039;t. You wouldn&#039;t love Kyouma if you&#039;re looking for a bishounen or someone who is nice and sweet. He isn&#039;t. He&#039;s a cold,  badass and detached person yet why do I love him so much? It&#039;s because he is himself. This goes for the other characters like Loser, Mary and even Salva. They aren&#039;t the type of people you&#039;d actually like but you like them anyway. <br />
<br />
Although one thing I have to say is that some characters felt like fillers. Even Al felt like a filler character. A lot of them are and some of them seem senseless. All in all, character-wise, Dimension W was pretty solid.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8): I left watching Dimension W thoroughly enjoyed. Although I didn&#039;t necessarily have those shouty feeling-feelings I usually have for an anime, I have to say that because of the action and the story, I definitely got hooked. There were more hits than misses but I think those holes could&#039;ve been filled if it were a few more episodes longer. <br />
<br />
Overall (8): If you&#039;re looking for an anime that can fill your action and angst needs, Dimension W is a pretty decent anime to go and watch.

    Sci-fi is a pretty common genre in not only anime, but other mediums, such as novels and movies, as well. For a sci-fi series to stand its ground, its need to at least  have a solid fleshed out world or rules that are consistent to that world, or else, everything else will fall flat and lose its impact. Dimension W follows the typical sci-fi formula while still being able to differentiate itself from others in the genre. In a world where unlimited energy is no longer an issue, Dimension W explores the possibilities and situations various people can still go through. Devices called Coils

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214371">
        were created to harness an unlimited source of energy. At first might be seen as a MacGuffin Device, Coils, which are pretty important in the world building, are a means to deliver elements of the narrative.  <br />
<br />
One of the many notable aspects of Dimension W is its ability to stay consistent to its own rules. I always admired how Dimension W was able to use its &quot;4-th dimension&quot; premise&quot; to craft intriguing yet enjoyable stories and plot points, plot points that actually become relevant as the series progresses. The show was able to build an interesting world with creative rules and still able make new ones while not breaking the show. Dimension W doesn&#039;t don&#039;t do anything groundbreaking, but the story for the most part is consistent and its all I ever want from sci-fi animated series. Another brilliant element of the show is its cast of characters. Kyouma is your typical badass main character who lives in the future, but due to unforeseen circumstances in the past, hates the world he lives in. Mira, his cute robot sidekick, provides a light cheerful mood in the relationship in contrast to Kyouma&#039;s serious and brooding demeanor. The chemistry and history between the two is enjoyable to watch, as well as give some levity to the dangerous situations they are put in. Another character, who is my personal favorite, is the supposed &quot;villain&quot; of the series, Loser. A masked vigilante with cybernetic enhancements with the power to manipulate energy, with an added bonus of having an awesome costume design and mysterious past. From the get-go, I was in love with his character and I loved what the show did to explore his character even more, giving him a meaningful yet compelling motivation. <br />
<br />
The animation for the most part is pretty solid, it isn&#039;t as shiny or as polished as a high budget anime, but it could have been a lot worse also. It gets the job done. When it came to action scenes, they were pretty enjoyable, though was a bit disappointed with the lack of choreography seeing as how Kyouma is basically a ninja... Well he is, isn&#039;t he?  The art and aesthetics of the show also work in its favor. The character designs are all unique and makes it easier to distinguish the characters. The choice of colors was also quite pleasing to see as it helps portray the beautiful world of Dimension W and its sci-fi landscape. The use of green was also quite clever as it is used to portray how energy flows in that world as well as give the various locations in the show charm. The music for the most part is pretty good. The Opening song, as well as the animation in conjunction with it, will be stuck in your mind for awhile. Seriously, it is that catchy. The OST is also pretty solid, however, they isn&#039;t many outstanding tracks. The ending song of each episode was also nice to listen to. <br />
<br />
There aren&#039;t many complaints I have with the series. Dimension W followed the typical sci-fi formula of having a futuristic setting for &quot;such and such&quot; reason and certain situations because of some science related disaster. The show sort of played it safe by following the usual tropes seen in sci-fi series, while still being able to bring something new to the table. The premise of unlimited energy, the existence of a 4-th dimension, and presence of impending doom all makes the show really enjoyable and entertaining to watch, which is all I want from a sci-fi  series. Not every sci-fi show needs to be an overly dramatic, dark, and serious thriller. I enjoyed every aspect of the show, and this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable series of 2016 so far, as well as my favorite of the Winter 2016 season. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend the show to those looking for a good action and sci-fi series, Dimension W will fill your needs. I can guarantee you will not get bored with the series. However, those looking for a serious and compelling story or a show with amazing visuals, you may want to approach this show with caution. Overall Dimension W is a pretty solid sci-fi series that entertained me throughout its entire run.

Story 8/10: This anime contains BOTH character and plot development. It has an interesting plot with a lot of backstories of each characters &amp; how they all interrelate with each other &amp; Dimension W. There is a lot of action &amp; fighting scenes with the characters in the anime. <br />
<br />
Characters 8/10: There are a lot of characters that are introduced in the anime. Most of them have a form of connection to Kyoma. (For this review, I will be focusing on the two main characters in the anime). Kyoma Mabuchi is tough guy and works as collector. He is also mean to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217517">
        Mira-chan over the series. Mira Yurizaki is helpful, understanding &amp; cute robot. She wants to be able to help Kyoma throughout their missions.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: One of the best animes that I have every watched. This was my #1 anime to watch on my TOP 10 Anime List. The theme song is awesome too. I always keep listening to it on replay -- if anything, Genesis will become my entrance theme song as a wrestler. The theme of robots, cars &amp; machines are cool too! I assumed that there might a romance between Kyoma and Mira in the future. <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10: All-around great anime with lots of actions. Great plot and backstories included! Dimension W has the potential to have a second season!<br />

    This would have been in my top 5 season of anime if it wasnt for the poor storytelling of the first half of the season.<br />
<br />
EP 1-6 is a 4.5/10 , EP 7-12 9.5/10<br />
<br />
I LOVE the premise of a robot learning how to be a human its my PB and J. Mira is a really cool character and concept but this season did a poor job of using her (hopefully they dig deep in later seasons).<br />
<br />
Kyouma was lackluster for me until they started to develop him in the latter of the season in which this dark little caterpillars past blossoms out into a beautiful story.<br />
<br />
Art and

        Sound i gave both 8, they dont seem to be anything special but the fight sound effects where cool and the colorful landscape of the Dimension W world is cool.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10, Soo many Animes try and fit 4+ main characters and develop them into a show im happy with this show for only having 2 and developing atleast 1 of them to my satisfaction. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10, I had to stop watching this because while it was airing because i really didnt like it as much as the other things i was watching, but after binge watching it i felt sucked in and had to finish it as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10, Could have been done better overall but if i were to here something like &quot;we spent most of the money on the Island arc&quot; It would make soo much sense to me

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
I do like a good Sci-Fi show from time to time and this is a very good example of that considering it has an interesting story and good characters to back it up.<br />
<br />
The year is 2071 and Humanity uses Coils to power pretty much anything and Kyouma Mabuchi a Collector who hunts down illegal coils in exchange for money suddenly ends meeting a little girl called Mira and then everything changes <br />
Now this show had a surprisingly good story it really delved into the whole mystery of how coils worked, what they can actually do and what secrets they hold that only a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249964">
        few people know it was very interesting watching the events unfold itself as the two MC&#039;s tried to figure out what was going on and why they were connected to the coils.<br />
I loved the relationship that developed between Kyouma and Mira who started off on the wrong foot and over time slowly started to become more of a team and respect one another, plus the show has a dark tone to it since Kyouma has a dark backstory which is really the answer to everything that happens, but there were a few other moments that were dark like the episode at Lake Yasogami which is when the anime suddenly turned supernatural, there was also quite a few plot twists throughout the show which did surprise me.<br />
<br />
The characters were actually really good even though Kyouma and Mira, especially Mira stole the show the other supporting characters weren&#039;t too bad either.<br />
Kyouma is an Ex-Soldier who became a Collector after an incident that happened, he hates coils and uses devices that we use today like a couple of Gasoline fuelled cars which included a Toyota 2000 GT which was pretty cool and he doesn&#039;t use guns instead he uses knifes attached to wires which at some point he kinda used like 3D Maneuver Gear from AOT when was jumping around and stuff, his personality is stubborn, short tempered and anti-social, but he is a definite badass because he knows how to kick ass mainly because of his experience as a soldier and because of his hatred for coils or anything technical he treats Mira poorly at first, but when he was finding out more about his past and the coils he slowly starts to loosen up to her and starts treating her like a teammate. Despite his personality and attitude towards other people when you find out what he was like in the past and what happened to him you do feel truly sorry for him and understand why he is like this.<br />
Mira was a brilliant, sweet and fun character who is also a robot, but compared to other robots I&#039;ve seen the way her body works is much like a humans just mechanical which made her very interesting and the fact that she has antennas that look like ears and a amplifier cord that looks like a tail then you have a robotic neko which is cute as hell, but don&#039;t be fooled because she is very intelligent and strong thanks to her robotic abilities, she is treated poorly by Kyouma because of this who keeps calling her junk which annoys Mira which when she reacts can be pretty cute and understandable, she is a very likeable character and has a big role in the events of the show since she was created for a specific reason that&#039;ll unlock the mystery of the coils.<br />
The other supporting characters were interesting too like the mysterious masked thief called Loser who is looking for special coils because they unlock something and the fact he used to be a scientist, he is a pretty cool character and his daughter Elizabeth wasn&#039;t too bad either since she was actually very useful helping out her father.<br />
There was two other guys like Albert who was a former soldier with Kyouma who has some banter with him from time to time and there was Lwai a prince of Isla who is actually a Robot being controlled by his mind from his real body (I know it&#039;s confusing).<br />
Not only that there was a bunch of other Collectors who were introduced later on in the show that also provided some good entertainment since they had some pretty interesting abilities.<br />
<br />
Now I did like the Artstyle it had a Cowboy Bebop feel to it mainly because it is set in funny enough the same year and it has that gloomy, dirty tone that Cowboy bebop had too, but the difference here is that Dimension W felt more advanced compared to Cowboy Bebop, I liked the design of some of the characters especially Mira who looked very strange, but cool and sweet as well plus some of the locations that Kyouma and Mira went too looked very interesting too like Lake Yasogami looked like it was out of a horror film and Easter island looked terrifying to be on.<br />
<br />
The action was actually pretty good it was fun seeing Kyouma and Mira kick some ass against badguy&#039;s , but some of the other characters also proved their worth too like Loser and even the other Collectors who has some pretty impressive abilities and these abilities were very handy when they were fighting against the Security Robots on Easter Island or against each other.<br />
<br />
Overall I think this was a fun and entertaining show that gave off a familiar vibe that I had with Cowboy Bebop so if you&#039;re someone who enjoys Sci-Fi or enjoyed Cowboy Bebop then this is definitely something you might want to check out.

    Although it says I completed it that is a bit of a bold face lie. Well not a lie, just more like I am half way through the last episode since I tried to watch it this morning but I had to go to school halfway through it. But none the less I am doing a review<br />
<br />
For those who don&#039;t know I&#039;m Josh and today I&#039;m reviewing the anime known as Dimension W. Let&#039;s do this<br />
<br />
Story- The setting is interesting. Personally I have never been an end all be all sci-Fi fan but I like the setting. The story on the other hand was...meh. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219344">
        mean it was original I give it credit there and not he worst story I have ever seen but it just felt...meh to me for some reason. Through the first 5 episodes I liked it but by the second half that is when I found it to be meh. It isn&#039;t really a bad story though. I don&#039;t know what happens in the end so I couldn&#039;t really say anything about that till I fully see it. Overall though I will give it a 6/10<br />
<br />
Art- I actually liked the art in this. Pretty good for what it is and I like the character designs to a certain extent. Plus the fight scenes were pretty cool Overall I give this a 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound- I love the opening to this to death. I will play it over and over again. That is how much I like it. The ending is average for me and the sound track is decent. Overall it gets a 7/10<br />
<br />
Characters- Like the story I did find he characters to be meh. Now granted I do like a couple of them but in the end the character just felt meh to me. Not hat they weren&#039;t interesting or anything, I just found them not to be that exciting really. Overall 6/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- I really enjoyed. It&#039;s one of those anime I just can&#039;t do anything but find myself enjoying it. Overall 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall- Dimension W isn&#039;t the greatest, but it is a pretty good anime to watch. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Sci-Fi anime really. Overall the show gets a 7/10 from me

    If you loves sci-fi, future, android related movies, this might entertain you (as well as a little bit of combat, I said little bit because it is just ok)<br />
<br />
The story revolves around the main character (Mabuchi Kyoma) and an android (Mira).<br />
<br />
The story about a future world where earthlings can substract infinite energy from the other dimension (or dimension in the axis W) through a device named coil. Kyoma who got a bad experience with coil failure is probably the only person on earth that doesn&#039;t use any coil and resort to old time battery and petroleum. <br />
<br />
One thing that doesn&#039;t stand out for me is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225768">
        the lack of climax and anticlimax each episodes. So the pace is relatively flat but still in an interesting phase. (I would usually ditch shitty anime in the first episodes, at least Dimension W survive)<br />
<br />
Artwork is awesome, there are a lot of variety in character design, quite fancy colouring. It is nice to watch, altough it is not that fancy in terms of combat animation (because it is an action sci-fi anime, I hope Kyoma have a better combat ability and a lot more combat skills)<br />
<br />
The main character was too cold for me, and it goes in at least 5-6 episodes until we know why he is that cold, and for me it is too slow. On the opposite, Mira who is tagging along Kyoma was more than cheerful as an android. Somehow in doesn&#039;t make sense how Yurizaki hakase can make such powerful AI (well, anime is anime right?)<br />
<br />
Overall I did enjoy Dimension W so far, so could not give less than 8 for this. <br />
I don&#039;t recall any anime that have specific type of story like Dimension W. Quite curious with the story development.

    Saw the original series synopsis that AniDB gave and didn&#039;t think this anime would be my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so glad I did start watching it, as it&#039;s probably one of my current favourites.<br />
<br />
The idea and concept aren&#039;t exceptionally new, as Psycho-Pass did touch on the same sort of subject, but the characters and the way the story is presented are top-notch.<br />
<br />
The way the episodes are set-out can be a bit confusing, but it&#039;s done in an ingenious way to keep potential viewers gripped. They have a standard episode, then they tease and reveal little snippets of the character&#039;s backstories, which are fabulous I must

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216488">
        add, and this teasing has certainly kept me chomping at the bit.<br />
<br />
Who is Loser? What are the memories Kyouma has lost? What happened on Easter Island? Who is Mira really and what are her goals? <br />
<br />
--Of course, these have been answered now the series is over--<br />
<br />
I really can&#039;t wait to see what they do in Season 2 (which I do believe will happen)

    In a day and age where energy is more or less required to live life, the constant demand forces us to use a lot more to gain very little.  Fossil fuels and and renewable energy both come with their pros and cons and really only serve to create conflict on determining what is the &#039;best method&#039; for satisfying the world&#039;s needs.  Dimension W gives us a little spin on that idea with an anime dedicated to energy, the future, and one kick-ass opening.<br />
<br />
Story:  Mabuchi Kyoma is a man that is known as a collector.  In the world he lives in now,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214439">
        all other sources of energy have been exempt from society where they now solely only rely on one new source of energy, Dimension W.  (Roll Credits) Utilizing a technology known as &#039;coils&#039; these little plugs harvest the energy from Dimension W and use them as clean, efficient energy without all of those nasty emissions and whatnot.  It is here where we have Kyoma working as a mercenary of sorts, beating down anyone who even thinks about using illegally manufactured or black market coils in a world that he despises.<br />
<br />
On the surface, Dimension W seemed like a show that would get into the nitty gritty of the energy that they make and the current state of the company that manages these godforsaken things.  We follow Kyoma&#039;s story as he makes his living as a collector, stating quite often that he &#039;hates&#039; coils and that he refuses to use any sort of coil technology.  In the beginning, the anime showed promise as it provided us with some rather interesting events of coil collecting due to the fact that the coils themselves are hardwired into the Dimension W, which does some pretty fucked up shit if left to go wild.  But only then did the show shift its focus around.<br />
<br />
The primary focus of Dimension W is to focus on the aftereffects of coils and coil usage.  These stories are more or less based around the &#039;paved with good intentions&#039; motif, as each event had positive effect before going horribly, horribly wrong.  As a result, the series felt rather plotless and was just more or less random events that spanned 1-2 episodes before going to the next one.  And then they decided to do some overarching plot stuff for its conclusion, and that just threw the series down a well.  Now why exactly is that?  Well, for starters, the show inputed a &#039;main antagonist&#039; to the series, something that it had previously never done before.  Plus, with Kyoma&#039;s backstory being rather cliched in its content and presentation, coupled with an end that really felt like there was really no real conflict at the end due to how relatively easy everything was without any repercussions...yeah, this ending wasn&#039;t particularly the most well written, especially since the characters only gained shit at the end instead of losing anything.  (I&#039;m all for happy endings, but this show did not seem to be happy for most of its run.)<br />
<br />
One other thing that bothers me is the fact that the show seems to be missing a lot of detail and/or lacking potential.  There were things like the actual &#039;New Tesla&#039; company that controls the whole coil business that seemed to be interesting, reasons as to why Mira, our main female protagonist, was created, and a whole slew of other potential storylines that just never saw the light of day.  Overall, Dimension W had potential, but just never really utilized it and instead, went a direction that went far beyond what was pre established in the beginning. <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Interesting story concept<br />
+  Storyline tapped into effects of its main story concept<br />
-   Many looses ends left untied<br />
-   Wasted potential on many aspects of the story<br />
-   Main character backstory rather cliched<br />
<br />
Characters:  For the most part, characters in Dimension W are more or less plot related.  Aside from our main two characters, everyone else is more or less shoved into the side cast. <br />
<br />
First we have Mabuchi Kyoma, the main protagonist of the series.  As a collector, Kyoma makes his living by hunting down illegal coil users in exchange for money, gas, all sorts of things.  As a person who hates coils (and I mean HATES coils), Kyoma&#039;s lifestyle is more or less equivalent to the life we live currently, meaning gas cars, battery powered phones, etc.  Kyoma is a character who only sees benefit for himself, and will only get the job done to help himself.  As the series goes along, you get to see his growth as he turns from this stone cold person into this slightly warmer being that isn&#039;t always so grumpy all the time.  My biggest issue with Kyoma is how forced his development is.  He changed only due to the plot, and it doesn&#039;t seem like the show would&#039;ve done it any way.  His backstory is more or less an &#039;amnesia turned back into memory&#039; deal involving romance in the past which doesn&#039;t really feel all that unique or interesting.  As a result, we have a character who was only changed due to the plot and really doesn&#039;t have any development that he personally does himself.<br />
<br />
Then we have Mira, the main female protagonist of the series.  As a robot who uses coils as her power source, Mira is equivalent to that of a human in many aspects, as she is more or less this spunky, childish character who is mostly referred to as &#039;piece of junk&#039; by Kyoma.  Mira is sort of the mascot character of the series and doesn&#039;t really do much aside from aid Kyoma in his progression through the story.  She is his partner out on the field for coil collecting, and only serves to aid in the story&#039;s progression and his forced development.  Personally, while I find her to be adorable due to how upbeat she is to counteract Kyoma&#039;s constant moping, there really isn&#039;t much to her beyond that.  Plus, there&#039;s this whole underlying question as to why she was created, but do we get an explanation?  No.<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, everyone else is more or less plot related more than anything.  All of the other characters participate to the plot in some way, either being part of an arc to bring about the major conflict for the episode, or aid Kyoma in giving him and Mira information and/or aid when it comes to dealing with the conflict.  Then there&#039;s Seameyer who is that shoehorned villain that comes in the end of the series who...I&#039;ll be honest, didn&#039;t really have a point to the series aside from being the convenient reason to have Loser and Kyoma hate life.  (Oh yeah, and there&#039;s a guy named Loser.  I laughed in spades when I found that out.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Somewhat interesting main cast<br />
+ Mira is relatively adorable.  (This is just my personal opinion.  There are those that find her annoying.)<br />
- The cast is more or less dragged along with the plot more than anything<br />
<br />
Art:  Produced by Studio 3Hz, Dimension W boasts a rather average style of animation.  To be honest, aside from the good CGI that they use to animate the coils and some other aspects of the show like the robots, cars, and monstrous hellspawns that come from the Dimension W, there really isn&#039;t anything remarkable about the artstyle.  <br />
<br />
But you know what?  I have to mention the stupid dancing that happens in the OP by Kyoma.  God that is spectacular.  It&#039;s so stupid, and unneeded, but my god that was a good choice by 3Hz.  I wish we got more of that, cause that was great.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good mesh of CGI<br />
+/- Good quality, not not spectacular art<br />
<br />
Sound:  Now, the OST is something I really want to talk about.  Genesis, made by Stereo Dive Foundation is a techno beat music that really resonates with Dimension W.  I personally don&#039;t listen to techno or music of this kind, but my god, this shit is addicting.  It adds in a lot of autotune and synthesizers that make the song a hell of a lot more memorable that it would&#039;ve been otherwise.<br />
<br />
The ED on the other hand is a song that has a more toned down feeling in respective to its OP.  There really isn&#039;t anything spectacular about it though.  If anything, it&#039;s not really particularly worth its time to listen to, especially when compared to the opening song.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good and memorable OP<br />
-   Average ED<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  When Winter 2016 rolled around, I was told that Dimension W was a series that had a lot of potential.  I was skeptical, but thought to myself that it was interesting enough and different from my usual kind of anime that I would dedicate time to watching it and may even like it in the end.  Well...right now, I&#039;m a bit on the fence in that regard.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
If I had to pick anything I liked, it would have to be just the innate world that we&#039;re in when it comes to Dimension W.  A society built around a new form of energy is bound to have a few kinks in the system, and I really wanted to see that.  Plus, I thought that Kyoma was badass initially, and I really wanted to pull off some epic stuff.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
Well, to be frank, the anime itself.  To get into specifics, its progression.  The series got progressively worse and worse with every episode till is more or less crawled its way to the end.  Anything that it had set up beforehand in the first couple episodes were more or less forgotten, and I didn&#039;t really find myself enjoying this series all that much<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime? <br />
<br />
Frankly, this anime is one that I would say it&#039;s up to you.  The kind of story it tell is more of a niche sci-fi kind of story more than anything, and it doesn&#039;t stick with what it cements down as plot.  As such, I don&#039;t personally recommend this show, but honestly, it&#039;s up to you in regards to whether or not you want to watch it.

    NOTE: This was originally a post among r/Toonami&#039;s Post-Series Analysis as a review there. The original post is linked here.<br />
https://www.reddit.com/r/Toonami/comments/4jersz/dimension_w_final_thoughts_thread/<br />
<br />
Well this was a quite a letdown.<br />
<br />
I mean I liked the first 4 episodes of the series, the inital premise was promising, and I find Kyouma, Mira, and Loser to be fun characters. But I found things went downhill with that 5th episode being so convoluted that I&#039;m still not sure what the fuck happened even with one guy giving me a wall of text explaining to me what happened. <br />
<br />
And sadly, I felt as if it never really recovered from that episode. It wasn&#039;t bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223396">
        enough that I would drop it and/or skip it all the time after that on the block like I did AGK, SAO2, or an average filler episode, but it was still a rather mediocre experience that made me care less and less with each episode that aired and it sometimes went back to making me question what in the flying fuck am I watching. It&#039;s ending did little to help me care either and its after credits scene just left me wishing that the series was more like that. At least I liked the OP(What little they played on the block) even if between this and Gangsta, Stereo Drive Foundation does seem to be stuck doing underwhelming shows. <br />
<br />
On the plus side, at least the series is short so it doesn&#039;t overstay its welcome and it does somewhat prove that some 12 episode shows can work on Toonami in the future like say My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Madoka Magica, or maybe even No Game No Life. Sadly, I don&#039;t think Dimension W is on the level with those shows.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, I didn&#039;t think it was terrible but I definitely feel like it wasted its potential in what could&#039;ve been a cool sci-fi anime like Psycho Pass or possibly Darker Than Black. But Oh Well, I still liked it better than Akame Ga Kill(the show Dimension W replaced) though, Just hope the show that replaces Dimension W is better.

    I&#039;ll start off like I usually do for reviews and if I enjoyed it or not. I enjoyed this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the quick summary is....Our MC Kyoma does not like Coils (Coils are the things taht run all technology in this world) and his job is ironically to hunt down illegal coils. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give a quick snapshot of what Dimension W (power source is) Dimension W is the fourth dimension that is being used as a energy source in this world. New Tesla is the organization that moderates the power. W is very unstable and illegal coils can go haywire and rip apart the fabrics of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218649">
        reality. <br />
Good! All caught up now I&#039;ll actually talk a bit about the story.  <br />
<br />
Now for the more in depth stuff that would be spoilerific. I don&#039;t do that. But the show itself spends the first 6 episodes with seemingly random missions where Kyoma meets Mira (Robot girl) and they become partners. Everything is told as a mystery not really knowing what is going on as the pieces come together. Kyoma also reveals that he has a bit of a memory lapse due to a mission he went with his group the beasts of Grendel.   <br />
<br />
The last half of the anime is big stuff as everything comes at a rapid fire pace with everything being solved pretty quickly. Everything begins to fall into place as we learn that some characters played a specific role in the huge event that also took Kyoma&#039;s memory....Also the main bad guy made me cringe because he looked very similar to someone snakey... that&#039;s all I say.(possible spoiler)<br />
<br />
 Also he shows up we learn about him..and is dealt with in...3 episodes? <br />
<br />
Thoughts: <br />
I gave it an 7. Dimension W is an anime that builds towards a big pay off in the end. It has a bit of scientific jargon flopping around as they try to make Dimension W sound as real as they could. It&#039;s a dimension of possibilities as is the anime. I&#039;m also a sucker for a cute girl like Mira. There&#039;s bits of action some blood and even a bit of darker moments. Although the dark moments are quickly defused a little too quickly for my taste. I&#039;ll say its a solid anime that will probably be forgotten due to nothing being extremely memorable. But hey it&#039;s something to check out.

    a futuristic anime where they&#039;ve unlocked the &quot;fourth dimension&quot; where they can draw out unlimited energy, thus resulting in robots and other interesting things that we dont know of yet in this day an age. Weird that they&#039;d use Tesla, but it works well with the story. <br />
 <br />
It took me a while before I could fully understand what was going on since you&#039;re just literally thrown into a story that really has no depth yet. <br />
<br />
Turns out this story follows a group of &quot;collectors&quot; looking for illegal coils for money, and conveniently enough they all suffer from huge loses in there lives. <br />
<br />
Most of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265446">
        these people are out looking to avenge the deaths of the people they have lost because for whatever reason they all have lost whats most important to them. <br />
