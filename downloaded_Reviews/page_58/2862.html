    Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is one of the anime that I know is not perfect, but I can&#039;t find any category to deduct points on. It perfectly bridges the connection between drama and anime.  Structure-wise, it is probably one of the best drama anime, due to its non-stop, suspenseful, concise storytelling in only 14 episodes.  The mistake of many drama series is to drag out the same dramatic plot for 24 episodes, but Kimi ga Nozomu Eien knows when to stop so the drama doesn&#039;t grow tedious.  There&#039;s no fillers, guest appearances, onsen excursions, or any of the sort.  From the

Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
If I had to pick the anime with the best plot, it would have to be Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.  Not only does the plot draw you in captures your attention, it is also unique in many ways:  It takes on life during and after a relationship, not so much two people trying to convince themselves that they like each other for 20 episodes.  In this way, the audience does not need to any unnecessary funny introductions or excessive blushing, but rather, the first episode sufficiently provides all the information needed to move on.<br />
<br />
Just when the anime was starting so look like a typical high school romance, disaster strikes, deeply affecting the four friends.  This is when Kimi ga Nozomu Eien enters a three year time skip, frequently revealing what happened during that time through short flashbacks.  The plot from here on is very unsettling and highly subjective, exploring many major themes such as friendship, betrayal, love, aspirations, endeavors, and escaping from reality. All of this comes together at once, consistently driving the story forward to the very end.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10, Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Although the art was only decent, the 9 rating goes to the portrayal of human emotions.  As you can expect for a drama series, this aspect is very important and crucial to complementing the dramatic plot.  All of this was done brilliantly in accompany with great background music.  I can relive, in my head, half of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&#039;s final episode because the series integrates the aspects of art and sound so well that the events becomes memorable.<br />
<br />
Music alone deserves a special mention.  For the first and second episodes of the anime, there were no opening sequences.  That doesn&#039;t mean that the anime did not have an opening. The opening starts out with a scene with Mitsuki swimming and Haruki watching, Takayuki and Shinji talking under a tree, and all of this was accompanied with soft, soothing music.  The ending for the first episode was nothing except Mitsuki silently listening to the Haruka&#039;s voice on the answering machine as the credits roll by.  In fact, it wasn&#039;t until the second episode that there was an ending. This ending sequence, called Rumbling Hearts, is the second best ending sequence I have ever seen; it continues the story from the second episode in an amazing way. The best, however, is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, the ending for the 14th episode.  It is an emotional sequence, summarizing the entire series with the lyrics of a song.  In my opinion there could not have been a better way to end the series, and the conclusion of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is probably the reason why the series is still my number one favorite.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
Three of the four original high school students were presented with the utmost detail.  The fourth, however, was not.  While some people did not like this, I am very comfortable it.  Even though the story is technically about the four high school students, the plot was only between three, so the (dis)appearance of Shinji for some time was understandable.  He did play a very big role later on in the plot, although it did not explore much more about him that we couldn&#039;t already assume in the first two episodes.  I agree with this decision to turn Shinji into a supporting character because it clarifies the plot without leading it into confusing territories.<br />
<br />
With this anime specifically, supporting characters are one of its most important elements, maybe even more so than the main characters.  It was the main characters&#039; actions that created the plot, but it was Akane, Shinji, Fumio, and others that actually drive the plot forward.  And then there&#039;s Ayu and Mayu, the well-needed comic relief of the series.  The balance of character development in Kimi ga Nozomu Eien was perfect down to the very last character, neither too excessive or lacking.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
The first time around this series will be excrutingly painful.  No matter which female lead you like, there will be moments where you feel very sad and sorry for a character, and it is just not a story you will want to sit through and enjoy.  Even though I&#039;m a pretty tough guy, I was teary for certain scenes of the final episode.  It doesn&#039;t really have a great re-watching value either, but one time watching through it is all you need.  You will end up watching specific scenes over and over again though, so you can be prepared for that.  It is enjoyable once it&#039;s over, but it might not while you&#039;re watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
All that aside, it is an excellent series that you have to watch and experience.  It is not for everyone; people who haven&#039;t watched a drama or romance series should not start with Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.  There are several memorable moments, such as the train station in episode two, Haruka telling the story of the fairy in episode fourteen, and Akane reading Haruka&#039;s story in episode fourteen.  If you are looking for a deep yet concise drama/romance that doesn&#039;t drag on endlessly, then Kimi ga Nozomu Eien for you.  I highly recommend it to all who can stand a little bit of drama.<br />
<br />
Akane: &quot;Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho. This is how Haru found the real treasure.&quot;<br />

    Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, also known by the name Rumbling Hearts. <br />
<br />
What this anime seems to accomplish like no anime before it is the amount of fake thrown at your face. It shows some promise in the first couple of minutes, but in the end, all it ever does is puke insincerity and exaggeration at your shoes. Taking this anime seriously for but only a second is a tedious and difficult task. I wouldn&#039;t recommend trying it to anyone, my suffering is enough alone.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A story? Come on, that is the last thing that this anime accomplishes to establish. A lovey-lovey sugar sweet drama with all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5554">
        sorts of different and complex conflicts? Please, if anything, you will laugh at the complete idiocy of it all. Fake fake fake! If anything even remotely similar would happen in reality I would be the first one to praise its uniqueness. As if the protagonist wasn&#039;t false to the bone enough, most conflicts could be handled just by communication alone. I&#039;m left to wonder if there could actually be someone as stupid as him - as if that wasn&#039;t enough, I&#039;m almost crying my eyes out silly that; of course, if a boy has a girl buddy in fiction, they automagically hook up. Seemingly, fiction seems to imply that males cannot have female friends without having a &amp;quot;thing for them&amp;quot;. If you dare call this a good drama I&#039;m left to pity you - go read Shakespeare&#039;s Othello. Whilst this anime has a thing for conflicts it executes them poorly and you&#039;re left confused with how this can even slightly relate to reality. It amuses me how people can call this slice-of-life when the relations are perfect, the conflicts are perfect, the setting is perfect, and the other seemingly non-important people are perfect; and of course, the ending is &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;. Yes, all perfect conflicts have perfect solutions, that&#039;s why you sure as hell can call this anime slice-of-life. You&#039;re not left amazed and flabbergasted of how this perfect story hangs you on the edge of the cliff with such an astonishing suspense. No, it has a suspense indeed - but it&#039;s a suspense of stupidity. Half of the suspense would wither away if only the protagonist wasn&#039;t so foolish. You could cut more than half of this anime by destroying the perfect settings and the perfect supporting characters. Doing this would actually be reasonable and actually add to this anime&#039;s credibility, but then everyone would see through this pile of sickening goo, that adds nothing but laughs and tears to the wonderful genre that is drama.<br />
<br />
To put all of that short; this anime tries violently to be something it never was, and never will be.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Pitiful and shockingly disgusting to watch. I can not say anymore, as it was fail to begin with. Of course you need some big round oh-look-at-the-five-light-sources eyes to achieve empathy with the characters. Amusingly, this relates to the story and proves a poor attempt at making an anime you&#039;re supposed to feel sympathetic towards. It was nothing short of awkward to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Oh, I&#039;m quite confident that all people have those cute lullaby voices. I have to be honest and confess something, at one point in this anime, at one of those supposedly heart-warming tear-jerking scenes I was about to reconsider this anime&#039;s good points, when suddenly I&#039;m bombarded with cutey comments that reek of incredibility in my ears. I could not stand the voice-actors, and even less the opening. What the opening succeeds to do is show you smiling girls and remind you of how fantastic the story is. The originality stuns me. The music broke through at some moments but was left unmemorable, which is far from a good thing in this context, disappointingly.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
One of the extreme downsides of this anime, my dislike of the protagonist should seem obvious but that&#039;s actually not the worst. Yeah, are there worse? Oh, believe it.<br />
<br />
Aside from the perfect relationships that are foolish, the protagonist who is nothing short of foolish, there is the rest of the cast who are pure fools. Alongside the protagonist the other two -main-characters show little integrity thought capability. It&#039;s like you&#039;re watching a show of puppets. Whilst the Muppets is also fake at least they manage to show some original personality - this show only again proves that it can&#039;t do anything but fling out perfect personalities that is just so short that you&#039;re supposed to feel rapport with them, whilst still understanding that this sort of personality can lead to conflicts. If you haven&#039;t realized by then the extreme improbability of this anime, you should at least by the time the characters are introduced.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Is it even possible?<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Probably one of the worst drama slice-of-life I have ever run across. It puts a dent on these genres that might never be repaired.

    This is quite possibly the best anime drama I have ever seen, and that&#039;s saying a lot considering that I usually am drawn to more action oriented anime.  One phrase that could describe Kiminozo is &#039;a beautiful mess of emotions.&#039;  The basic concept or plot puts Takayuki (the main male character) on the theme of choosing someone he loved dearly in the past, or staying with the girl he loves now in the present.  A majority of the anime shows the feelings and emotions that take place while Takayuki is deciding on who to ultimately be with in the end.  This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review276">
        is what makes the anime so great.  One truly has sympathy to the characters as they struggle with their feelings.  Eventually, you&#039;ll start rooting for the character you want Takayuki to choose and thus motivates you to continue watching.  This leads up to the dramatic conclusion in which Takayuki chooses the girl he loves...who is the girl he chooses?  You will have to watch to find out.  All I can say is that the girl I wanted him to end up with got chosen.  :)<br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t too bad, but it isn&#039;t great either.  I felt the character designs were great though.  Kiminozo also has some pacing issues.  There were some moments where it just felt too dragged out and not much was happening.  However, if you&#039;re the type who enjoys slow and painful dramas that continuously builds, then you&#039;ll enjoy this aspect of Kiminozo.  Another problem focuses on two co-workers of Takayuki that provide comic relief.  I felt that they did an excellent job with the comic relief since after painful, dramatic, and depressing scenes, the anime usually focuses on the two co-workers to lighten up the mood, but most viewers would say that these scenes of comedy ruin the impact of the sadder moments.  The ending itself also left me feeling unsatisfied.  After watching this emotional rollercoaster, I expected the ending to be nothing short of spectacular, but instead it was just a &#039;good&#039; ending.<br />
<br />
Some other stuff I would like to point out is that the first two episodes serve as an introduction to the main story.  I would highly recommend to continue watching until at least the third episode.  The first episode gives the impression that it&#039;s going to be a bland, generic, &#039;highschool life&#039; anime, which this is definitely not.  After watching the second episode though, most everyone continues watching to see what happens next.  Personally, I absolutely loved this anime and I&#039;m incredibly bias towards giving this a perfect 10.  However, that wouldn&#039;t be fair to those who are actually using this review to decide whether or not to watch KGNE, so I have pointed out some of the faults this anime has.  Overall, I would say if you enjoy dramas, then I would recommend this wholeheartedly.  However, if you&#039;re more action oriented, expect explosions, and do not particularly enjoy the &#039;slice of life&#039; genre, you might not enjoy KGNE, but I would still say check this out.  <br />

    Would a doctor really not tell a comatose patient how many years they&#039;ve been in a coma? I understand slowly introducing a person to the idea that a period of time has in fact passed, but to out right lie and treat the person as if they are an invalid or a mentally retarded person who can&#039;t pick up on the concrete clues around them that something is off? This question bothered me to the point I had problems picking up this Anime and it bothers me even after I&#039;ve finished it.<br />
<br />
I have come to the conclusion that a comatose person is honestly not represented

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55275">
        well in this story. First off, I have to question the fact that Haruka didn&#039;t notice that her hair was longer then what it was or that her sister had gone from being flat chested to big busted. She would have had concrete memories of what herself and her sister looked like before her accident and you don&#039;t have to look in a mirror to tell if your hair is long. <br />
<br />
On top of this, I might as well mention that her hair would have been kept short as it is easier to manage, rather then those long locks that Haruka had in the Anime. I also doubt there would be any mention of rehabilitation while the patient was still within the coma, yet the doctor tells Akane that her sister is ready and prepared to go into rehabilitation if she just wakes up. I&#039;ll also add that rehabilitation starts as soon as a patient wakes up from their coma and isn&#039;t just about walking.<br />
<br />
Add to the unrealistic of the situation we find the characters in, the first two episodes were honestly a pain to get through. Haruka and Takayuki&#039;s relationship never felt like a real relationship. Haruka was crushing on him and Takayuki went out with her because she was Mitsuki&#039;s friend. There is no telling whether he really did like her or he simply liked being with her which were two different things entirely.  <br />
<br />
A lot of this Anime storyline seems to be soft footing it around Haruka&#039;s feelings and not hurting them. Which is the real reason I feel nobody told Haruka the truth. It wasn&#039;t because she had some sort of weak psyche but because nobody wanted to see her cry and feel bad about having lost the years. Truth of the matter is, it would have been kinder to let her cry about the things going on around her rather then letting her find out people lied. And not small lies either.<br />
<br />
As for the art style, I wasn&#039;t pleased with that either. Sure, the characters had some beautiful designs when it came to the face, but the body proportions were awkward at times. I also think the high school girls uniform is one of the ugliest I&#039;ve seen. And no... I&#039;m not talking about the uniform you see with the typical sailor blue outfit like you see in the pictures. No, the color is this rather ugly shade of purple. This isn&#039;t to say there aren&#039;t pieces of artwork that isn&#039;t well done, but there is a major lack of consistency. Sound didn&#039;t stand out much on the other hand.<br />
<br />
As for characterization, for the ridiculous plot they were given the characters honestly acted the way they should have in the situation. However, goodness knows they shouldn&#039;t have been in the situation they were put into. I guess the best way to put it, this is the kind of bad plot line I would expect of a fanfic writer, where the fanfic writer has their favorite couple and throws in a love triangle to spice things up. The only difference I think is the fact that all the characters were shown in a rather positive light, though some fans of this series are likely to disagree and badmouth the character they don&#039;t like.<br />
<br />
I honestly did not enjoy the first two chapters. Haruka felt way to needy and there was always this need to not hurt her feelings and shelter her from the real world. I honestly hate doing this because it only ends up hurting people. I struggled with the lack of realism when it came to the situation, but I did find the character interactions in the last twelve episodes to be how I&#039;d expect people to act in the situation. That also said, this took me multiple times to pick this up and once I did, I found myself debating whether to drop it or not.<br />

    Rumbling Hearts (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien) is another anime that I checked out because of a recommendation on this very site. Right off the bat I’m going to say I have a sort of love/hate opinion of this anime. On the one hand I think the story is pretty good, the characters are for the most part written well and the music is excellent. However there are three underlining issues I had with this show.<br />
<br />
First problem. Somewhere along the line in the making of this show the writers somehow got the idea into their heads that this story needed comedy for balance. Sometimes that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17866">
        needed for certain stories but for a tragic love story like this the comedic element had no right being in there. Take a look at Voices of a Distant Star do you think that story needed humor, of course not. The problem is that not only is the comedy not funny its not even balanced at all, it just randomly pops up jolting you out of the mood of the story. The comedy comes in the form of two young girls that work in the family restaurant with Takayuki. All I can say about them is that there are so many words I can use to describe this element of the story; stupid, pointless, annoying, jarring, unnecessary, not funny you get the idea. The two characters just ended up being this sort of out of place scratch on perfectly good story. Takayuki doesn’t even seem to be the same person when he’s around these two characters, like he doesn’t even have all this drama going on in his life. Fortunately these comedy scenes don’t appear too often, and when they do the fast forward button is your friend. They contribute approximately zero to the plot and the point of the story. <br />
<br />
Second problem. Takayuki and Haruka’s initial ‘courtship’ I suppose you could call it, is way too short. It starts a bit abruptly in the first episode and only goes on to the end of episode 2 which is when “tragedy strikes” as stated in the synopsis. In the story it’s implied that the relationship went on for weeks but as a viewer all we really got were two episodes of it. Although I thought it was an interesting move to shift time to when the characters are in their 20s, those scenes of Haruka and Takayuki together in the second episode are the best scenes in the whole series and it really would have been nice if they’d gone on longer.<br />
<br />
Now if it was just these two two things I could’ve lived with it and gave the show top marks but this final issue is a doozy, a major point of contention among people that liked this anime. The ending. Obviously I’m not going to say what it is, but never in all the time I’ve been watching anime have I disliked and disagreed with how they ended a series, and I’ve seen evangelion. I’m not saying that the ending made no sense or that they didn’t wrap everything up properly, I just really really disagree with how they dealt with it. The thing with romance stories is that it’s all about the ending, if you don’t like that then what came in-between doesn’t really matter. The closer it got to the end more I got the feeling I wasn’t going to like where each of the main characters was going to end up when the music stopped. I mean this seriously bugged me afterward and I can’t help but feel that it was the intention of the writers. If you’ve provoked a strong emotional response with the viewer then I think you’ve succeeded at something. Whether or not it matters if it’s a negative or positive response is debatable.<br />
<br />
I could quite easily do a fairly objective bullet-point tirade on how much I disagree with the wrap up of Rumbling Hearts but that would require major spoilers across the board. But despite all my ramblings on the ending there is light at the end of the tunnel, something that saves this anime for me. It comes in the form of the four episode OVA called Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~, it was released a few years after the initial anime. The existence of this OVA only goes to reinforce my belief that there were many people that weren’t happy with the original ending. This OVA essentially rewrites the ending to the way it should have gone, as well as putting in new flashback dialogue to make the ending work with what came before in the original story. <br />
<br />
So if you are new to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien then I recommend your viewing to go like this: watch the anime up to the second last episode (13) and forget about the last episode (14). Then watch the OVA. This will deliver a much more satisfying and better ending. It will also be how I plan to watch this when I decided to see it for a second time.

This is not your normal happy, romantic, shallow, childish, idiotic, puffy pink harem anime that i hate so much, even dough it has the triangle love story... it&#039;s quite the opposite, it&#039;s realistic, dramatic, depressive and really deep and somehow it managed to impress me so much that it even gave me tears... and belive me, I&#039;m not an emotional guy at all so tears are rare with me.<br />
<br />
It starts like a normal, generic, romantic anime but it really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review811">
        takes a huge and tragic turn that will keep you on an emotional ride like you never experienced in a romance/shoujo. You might hate Takayuki or even simphatize with him and the difficult situation he&#039;s in and the imposibile choice he has to make, you&#039;ll really feel sorry for the two girls, Haruka and Hayase and you&#039;ll blame the director for all the suferince they are going through... but in the end you&#039;ll really be happy you had the chance to see such a great anime.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
The animation is shoujo, big eyes and cute faces, apropiate to the genre, but it looks like they didn&#039;t give too much atention to the animation or they didn&#039;t have the money for it, but I can forgive them for that and still give them a full grade since this anime impressed me much and I got really sympathetic with the characters.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The music was just right with the situation, and the Ed song is a real masterpiece, being sooo smooth and romantic, just a delight to the ears. The voice acting was good and belive, it has to be since it involves expressing many feelings, but moslty sadness.<br />
<br />
Only problem:<br />
... one thing that really bothered me was the restaurant duo, yeah the two little girls who seem to be a reminisence from the hentai game that this anime was inspired. the little girls ruined the mood, had no real importance and effect in the story development and if you think about it from the realism point of view i really doubt that in Japan they let 12 years old kids work in restaurants (minors aren&#039;t allowed to work)... but<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not gonna lower a story or character point for that since these chapters were brilliant, i&#039;m gonna lower one from the animation who wasn&#039;t 10 worthy anyway, just to show this anime wasn&#039;t perfect.<br />
<br />
Value and Enjoyment:<br />
In the end it&#039;s more that a romantic triangle story... it&#039;s about a tragedy, an imposibile choice and in the end about passing life&#039;s hard obstacles and growing up... we are all moving and &amp;quot;the eternity you wished for&amp;quot; is just a moment that passed.<br />
<br />
What can i say.... even if you&#039;re not a romance fan, watch this, there&#039;s always an exception to the rule, i know this one was for me!

    I do not have a very positive review of this series. While I do appreciate the effort of bringing the drama aspect to anime, and do say it really was a good marriage of two genres, I really really despise Mitsuki&#039;s character. I respect the fact that the author presumably attempted to make a more true-to-life type love triangle, what with not everything meshing together as anticipated, and not everyone coming out with smiles who deserved them, I  can&#039;t express enough how livid this series made me. I felt that Mitsuki&#039;s character was incredibly selfish and self-centered and maybe the main character was a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21035">
        little too dense to realize what she was. I felt that the author attempted to make the viewers fond of Mitsuki by mentioning &quot;the pain&quot; she had been through, however, from what I saw, her &quot;pain&quot; amounted to nothing but the troubles she piled on herself. I felt it was a feeble attempt to bring some sense of pity and righteousness to her pathetic character. I do have to compliment the story-TELLING aspect, however. If the author intended to give the audience strong feelings one way or another about any character, they certainly achieved that. Also, for a relatively short series the story itself progressed nicely enough without skipping anything or dragging anything unnecessary out. That is really the only positive points I can think of. Other than that, the series held no enjoyment for me whatsoever.<br />
This series made me so mad my friend and I threw a cheez-it at the t.v. XD

    Title: Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien<br />
<br />
Game, Anime: Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien was originally a PC dating sim released in 2001 by age, and was later ported as a family-friendly version known as Rumbling Hearts to the Dreamcast by Alchemist (who also did a port of Aria the Natural and Bincho-tan), and to the PS2 by Princess Soft.<br />
<br />
The anime itself was produced by Studio Fantasia (who also produced the Saikano OVA and did the animation for The End of Evangelion), and directed by Tetsuya Watanabe (who also produced the Tsubasa and xxxHOLIC movies).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2003 to January 4th, 2004,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1299">
        and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation; the third and final volume was released March 27th of this year.<br />
<br />
Story: The first few episodes focus on the developing relationship between two high-schoolers (Takayuki and Haruka), and how Haruka&#039;s friend (Mitsuki), who also has feelings for Takayuki is dealing with this.  Don&#039;t immediately write this off as your stereotypical shoujo romance, though; in the second episode, Haruka gets into an accident that sends her into a coma.  The next episode picks up three years later, with Mitsuki and Takayuki in a relationship, and Haruka just coming out of her coma.  The rest of the series is centered around what happens because of Haruka&#039;s waking up.<br />
<br />
This is one of the best romances I&#039;ve seen in a good long time.  There&#039;s a real push-and-pull between Mitsuki and Haruka, whereas you&#039;re clearly meant to side with one or the other in most series.  Also, one of the reasons for the first two episodes, which may seem unnecessary at first glance, is to establish all the characters and get you involved before they start getting into the real meat of the story.  And damn, does the actual story of the series deliver.  Like Saikano, if this series doesn&#039;t make you cry, or at least get close to it, at least once, you&#039;re a heartless bastard.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s one thing I didn&#039;t like about this series, though: all the female characters.  Yeah, I understand that there&#039;s going to be a lot of them, what with it being based off a dating sim and all, but about half of them were simply two-dimensional and simply put there comic relief.   Here&#039;s the thing: they could&#039;ve limited the story to just Mitsuki, Takayuki, Shinji (another one of Takayuki&#039;s friends), the girl he&#039;s pursuing, Haruka and her family, and the series wouldn&#039;t have suffered at all, though it would&#039;ve been a bit more depressing.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don&#039;t like the way the series turned out, there is an OVA that&#039;s due to come out on December 21st in Japan that gives the happy ending for the girl who didn&#039;t end up with Takayuki (what, you thought I&#039;d spoil it for you?).<br />
<br />
Art: I love the way they did the eyes in this series.  I know that&#039;s an odd thing to pick out, but they really stuck out to me.  Otherwise, the art&#039;s pretty standard; good quality, and pretty.  The only real color scheme I noticed was a tendency towards blues, purples, and greens, which are some of my favorite colors.<br />
<br />
Music: The OP and ED aren&#039;t anything to write home about, really; the OP&#039;s the standard female upbeat number, and the ED&#039;s a female balladish-type of song.  The background music&#039;s heavy on strings and piano, and it&#039;s nice enough, but it doesn&#039;t really stand out all that much.<br />
<br />
Length:  Just the right length; honestly, I probably couldn&#039;t have taken any more than what they had here, and any shorter than this, and it would&#039;ve screwed the story over.<br />
<br />
Seiyuu: Takayuki&#039;s seiyuu also played Seiji in Midori no Hibi and Eusis in Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament, and Daisuke Ono shows up in a throwaway role, so that&#039;s a nice touch.  Good cast, overall.<br />
<br />
Overall: An excellent story with a strong emotional core that gets you invested in all its characters and pretty eyes.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Music: 7/10<br />
Length: 8/10<br />
Seiyuu: 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 39/50; 78% (C)

    Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (which translates to &quot;Rumbling Hearts&quot;) is a romantic drama with extra emphasis on the drama. To give a good explanation of the kind of romantic drama this show is, you need only look at the most recommended (by far) show for Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, good old happy go lucky &quot;School Days.&quot; With horrible and indecisive characters, an annoying love triangle that is made annoying by said indecisive characters (mainly the main character, Takayuki), and lies galore, this anime may start off strong, but it crashes halfway through the story like a fiery train wreck.<br />
<br />
Story - 5/10<br />
<br />
The story begins with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105901">
        group of four high school friends. Takayuki has just recently become friends with the star of the swim team, Hayase Mitsuki. Mitsuki introduces him to a shy friend of hers named Suzumiya Haruka, who happens to have a crush on Takayuki. Mitsuki helps set the two of them up (see where the School Days aspect is coming in), but Takayuki is still a little unsure about his feelings for Haruka and causes her some trouble due to his indecisiveness. It&#039;s clear that he has some feelings for Mitsuki which he has kept hidden, and it also is shown that Mitsuki has some for him as well. Nevertheless, not wanting to hurt Haruka, he finally manages to start acting like a good boyfriend.<br />
<br />
However, tragedy soon strikes which sends Haruka into a coma for three years. And here comes the first of the many problems in this show: when someone comes out of a coma, it is not a good idea to lie to them about how long they were asleep. You can ease them into the fact that they slept for several years, but making them believe that they are still in high school for several weeks is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but Mr. Indecisive finally managed to move and ended up with Mitsuki. Everything seems to be going well until they hear that Haruka has woken up. And then (along with the lies from Takayuki that make Haruka believe he only has feelings for her), the love triangle resumes full force.<br />
<br />
The show held up at around a 7 overall for me until around halfway through. While some things annoyed me earlier on, the real problems (and where the School Days part really comes in) around halfway and until the end are where I believe this show fails. The soap opera drama and dumb characters who make dumb decisions just destroy all of the romance this show originally had and instead leave a jumbled mess of lies, alcohol, and confusion.<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
Considering that Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is ten years old (it came out in 2003), the art is actually quite good. While it can&#039;t quite compare to Fullmetal Alchemist (sorry I haven&#039;t seen many other shows from around this time), it is by no means bad, and I actually like some of the characters designs quite a lot (especially for Akane, Haruka&#039;s younger sister). It does a good job of setting up the scenery and mood for the more dramatic scenes (even if the drama of the story often fails).<br />
<br />
Sound - 5/10<br />
<br />
The voice actors do a pretty good job throughout, but there&#039;s hardly any music that&#039;s noticeable. I noticed an interesting song in the second to last episode but other than that, paid no attention to it. For many scenes, there is just no music at all.<br />
<br />
Character - 3/10<br />
<br />
By far the worst category, while none of the characters seem bad initially, around episode 3 when the real drama starts, the characters slowly begin their journey towards the train wreck awaiting them. Takayuki (who probably inspired the indecisive Makoto from School Days) is by far the worst character in this show with the two main females characters following him for second and third place. After the tragedy that struck Haruka, Takayuki fell into depression for around a year and became a shut-in instead of going to college. Mitsuki was finally able to help him overcome his depression and since then he had not visited Haruka at all. He began working part-time at a family restaurant and began dating Mitsuki.<br />
<br />
Mitsuki seems to have a phobia of people swimming after she lost an important preliminary race in high school after Haruka&#039;s accident. The whole drama surrounding this is kind of strange because they just drop it at some point without ever really addressing it at all. Mitsuki is also a bad, indecisive character except that her problems are pretty much all caused by Takayuki. Almost every problem in this show can be traced back to Takayuki due to the fact that the problems he causes Haruka and Mitsuki have a domino effect and strike the people around them.<br />
<br />
Haruka is really only a bad character due to the writers&#039; stupidity in deciding that it was a good idea to have the other characters hide the information that she was asleep for three years from her. They also added in some memory loss thing to try to explain why she didn&#039;t find it strange that her younger sister had grown half a foot and finished puberty during the time she was asleep or why Haruka&#039;s hair had grown to twice the length it was before. So she just continues on in the hospital fully believing that Takayuki is studying for his exams and loves her the same way he was before the accident.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are the one place where this anime does not completely fail. I actually like Haruka&#039;s sister, Akane, as she goes from a bratty middle schooler who enjoys teasing Takayuki about his relationship to a mature high schooler who truly loves her sister and tries her best to keep Takayuki from hurting her with his indecisiveness. The girls at the family restaurant where Takayuki works (Daikuuji and Mayu) are also good characters and are mostly there to provide some nice comic relief.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 4/10<br />
<br />
I did enjoy the first half quite a bit, but this show just dies and becomes a drawn out romantic mess after a while. Things slow down and I believe this anime might have been better off with a couple less episodes (maybe 11 or 12 instead of 14). You could get rid of some of the stupid, meaningless mistakes the characters make by doing that.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5/10<br />
<br />
While it has plenty of problems later on, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien does have a fairly good start. The art is also pretty good for it&#039;s time and some of the supporting characters are interesting. Still, the main characters and the idiotic decisions they make throughout the show keep this from being enjoyable and instead make it downright annoying. It&#039;s one of those shows where you just want to yell at the characters and tell them to stop being morons.<br />
<br />
If you did enjoy this, then you may like School Days and Suzuka, which also has a similar love triangle and drama. If you want a much better anime that is somewhat similar to this, try Clannad (especially Clannad After Story).

    Story: 10<br />
The story was really original and while I started it off thinking it would be some lame school days knock off I can look back now saying I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#039;t. The story is really compelling and the ending felt just right. Don&#039;t be fooled by the synopsis.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
The way the characters are represented it feels like you&#039;ve known them forever and you really get attached and into the story more through them, which is how characters are supposed to be. You may start disliking some of the characters at first but then you realize that you&#039;re wrong in your assumptions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9393">
        about them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
The ending song really fit the story and the story always left off at a very dramatic moment with the end music amplifying it, I didn&#039;t believe that any of the voices were out of place or didn&#039;t fit the characters and all of the syncing was fine. (Note this show is dubbed, but I watched it subbed so I have no idea of the dubbing quality of the show)<br />
<br />
Animation/Art: 10<br />
The backround&#039;s were always beautiful and fitted the feelings wonderfully and the characters all had a very new and crisp look despite this show being 4-5 years old. I also cannot recall any moments where the characters randomly look different (you guys know what I mean) which is pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I really liked this story the more I watched it and before I even realized it I got hooked onto the plot and started talking to the screen telling the main character what to do and thinking what I would have done. I wasn&#039;t disappointed at all by the ending or what the main character ends up doing and I hoped it would turn out that way and it did. I cried at the end of this show, and in fact I cried a few times during the last episode, think what you want. A 2nd season exists and I might watch it, but the ending leaves off well enough to not need to.<br />

    Back when I originally started seriously getting into anime, I used to carefully handpick which ones to watch, and generally avoided titles that I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d like, such as comedies, romances and, err, romantic comedies. And I&#039;d be pretty good at judging (usually from the description and artstyle) which anime I&#039;d like and which I wouldn&#039;t. Some time down the line though, I decided that I should probably expand my horizons (probably due to getting into reviewing at the time - your opinions tend to not carry much weight when you give everything a 9+ rating :P), and started watching anime that I wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30315">
        sure I&#039;d like. &quot;Full Moon wo Sagashite&quot; and &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; were two highly rated shows that I was skeptical about that I watched as part of my attempt to expand my viewing range.<br />
<br />
That 50+ episode series &quot;Full Moon wo Sagashite&quot; turned out to be roughly 40 episodes of disappointment, with only the last arc able to redeem the series, so I didn&#039;t start &quot;Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien&quot; (abbreviated as KGNE for the remainder of this) with much hope that it&#039;ll be much better than &quot;okay&quot; at best. After watching the opening episode, I concluded that not only does it look unlikely to rise above being &quot;okay&quot;, it&#039;s likely to be considerably worse, because the first episode made KGNE look like a run of the mill romantic attempt-at-comedy show filled with extremely lame dialogues. Honestly, the only thing comical about it is how awful it is.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 was not much better, but ended with an unexpected twist that altered the dynamics of the show completely. After that, the series changed beyond recognition. As the episodes progressed, the characters quickly gained depth and realism, and I was soon completely taken in by the turbulent drama in the show. Each episode is more heart wrenchingly painful than the previous one, even when I thought the situations the characters in couldn&#039;t possibly get any more messy. Despite the occasional plot device and convenient timing used to set up some of the tricky situations, the problems faced by the characters are mostly very believable. This is not one of those &quot;Saikano&quot; type melodramas where the characters are always busy doing inexplicable things in order to make the story more &quot;tragic&quot;. No, KGNE&#039;s drama arises more naturally, from characters being caught in realistic no-win scenarios, or making mistakes that I can&#039;t help but sympathise with. Comparisons with soap operas are certainly warranted, but this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing - soap operas can be engaging and addictive to watch too, at least in parts. And besides, KGNE has the advantage of being a tight, compact 13 episoder with a single storyline, so doesn&#039;t run the risk of getting tiresome after being shown for about 74 years like a soap opera where it might feel like the same materials are being recycled endlessly.<br />
<br />
KGNE is actually based on an H-game, but it&#039;s obviously done a good job of picking out the more poignant content while leaving out the more distasteful parts. Admittedly, some of the traits of a dating sim can still be detected within the show, which is a shame, but at least it&#039;s nothing as blatent as say, &quot;Clannad&quot;, where I&#039;d have to be blind not to see it. Though KGNE is occasionally guilty of being too melodramatic, in general the emotions contained in the show such as heartache, frustration, and guilt all come across powerfully and convincingly. Despite the cast being composed of plain, ordinary people, their compelling portrayal makes them stand out. A lot of anime can polarise viewers into separate camps that support their own favourite character, but in the case of KGNE, even as a single viewer, I feel my sympathies being almost ruthlessly divided between the different people involved, just like the main character Takayuki is torn between his two main love interests. Abandoning either is cruel, and the catch is, of course, the more he remains undecided, the more he hurts those two people. Hayase is another wonderfully developed character, her pitiful descent into depression is vividly fleshed out and heart breaking to watch. There is no easy answer to any of the characters&#039; problems, and KGNE does an excellent job of drawing the viewer into this big, entangled web of conflicting emotions. A lot of people seem to think the characters don&#039;t act realistically because of their apparent lack of rationality that causes them to keep making stupid mistakes. But since when are humans renowned for always making rational decisions, especially when it comes to matters of the heart? The key issue is whether those mistakes are understandable given the context of the situation, and in the case of KGNE, this is very much the case.<br />
  <br />
I&#039;m not sure what to make of the comedy thrown into the mix. On one hand they can provide some nice contrast against the gloomy mood that makes up the majority of the show. On the other hand, you can also argue they dilute the atmosphere. Personally, I think it does more of the former than the latter, but there&#039;s one thing that I really hated about it, and that&#039;s the comedy previews they tend to have at the end of the episodes. Occasionally I come across previews that are really good actually manage to add to the show, but most previews are forgettable and don&#039;t really make the show better or worse. KGNE&#039;s previews are a rare case where the show is actually worse off because of it. This is due to the fact that most of the episodes end on a rather depressing note, and this atmosphere is completely ruined by the comedy previews that comes afterwards.<br />
<br />
There are a few other weaknesses within KGNE too, though they are mostly quite small ones. For one thing, despite its astronomical increase in quality in the later episodes, the dialogue still occasionally plummet down to the lowly levels of the first episode. Also, I think Taira should have been given more focus and development. Though he appears in a crucial part of the story, and plays that part perfectly well, his lack of screen time made him feel like a character that exists soley for that purpose. And then there&#039;s the animation, though mostly it&#039;s fine, the dynamic scenes (luckily there&#039;s not that many) are pretty poor in general. And Hayase&#039;s blue hair also sticks out in a show that&#039;s so down to earth.<br />
<br />
The last episode of KGNEdeserves special mention for being an incredibly emotional one. It provides a fantastic ending that brings the series to a near perfect closure. Is it possible to establish romantic feelings for someone over time, or do those feelings need to be there to begin with? Interestingly, the answer that the KGNE ending seems to be leaning towards is not one I would expect for a romantic show (though perhaps it&#039;s understandable, given its H-game roots). As a series, KGNE may not be as perfect as its ending, nor is it brimming with originality, but it&#039;s an outstanding anime that succeeds at what it&#039;s meant to do so well that it changed my attitude towards conventional romance anime, and that&#039;s saying something.<br />

    &quot;you&#039;re like a disease, everyone you surround yourself with suffers...&quot; ouchh<br />
<br />
Mitsuki&#039;s best friend Haruka likes Takayuki Narumi, but she&#039;s too shy to talk to him. Mitsuki being out going and a known swimmer in her school wants to help Haruka and befriends Takayuki herself. They become close friends and she een secretly has feelings for him. One day while meeting Mitsuki, Haruka meets him and later on confesses, Takayuki remembering Mitsuki and their friendship agrees to date Haruka. One day tragedy strikes and these three people will ahve their friendsships tested in ways they didn&#039;t imagine.<br />
<br />
This is a story about love, lies and loss. At

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32391">
        the beginning Takayuki and Haruka get together even though the y have nothing in common. Even though all things pointed to the opposite. When you picture someone else in your had when someone confesses the answer should be &quot;No.&quot; But Takayuki is so flawed! But then again I&#039;m no dude and you never know when faced with these types of situations a guy would do the same. The feeling of the same throughout. Whoever you like you&#039;ll end up liking and if you don&#039;t it&#039;ll stay the same.<br />
<br />
[Mild Spoiler]<br />
Time passed and seasons changed but they stayed the same.. There was a chapter called “Moving on.” It should have been “Moving on… didn‘t work.” I get it, I mean it’s hard to move on from that specially because the person is not really gone to begin with.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Haruka Suzumiya- (nothing like Haruhi Suzumiya) is just a victim, but she plays the role annoyingly well. The english version made her annoying to me but the japanese is not so bad. She was so shy and common, there really wasn&#039;t anything special about her in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Mitsuki Hayase- Some people might dislike her but I didn&#039;t. She was headstrong, at first, then love changed her and she became someone she didn&#039;t recognize and I thought that her character was easy to sympathize with. Her character makes you ask yourself if you would let love pass you by or will you chase it...<br />
<br />
Takayuki Harumi- What can I say, he barely showed emotions and was so confused it&#039;s a wonder his left and right foot never crossed paths. He is never honest with himself. His good point is that he could carry guilt like no other.<br />
<br />
Shinji Taira- He is Takayuki&#039;s best friend and his on screen time increases towards the end. Though not part of the summary plays a good role in this anime and is my favorite character, just because he is honest and not annoying. He was there for Mitsuki and he isn&#039;t involved in the drama that is their friends lives.<br />
<br />
The anime was not bad for running in 2003. It feels like it&#039;s happening now, it&#039;s not old fashioned. The English voices, I didn&#039;t like. Just because Haruka sounded so low and shy I had to put my volume higher just for her. Takayuki&#039;s voice sounded too old for him, he showed no emotion in it. All in all, it didn&#039;t go with him. Mitsuki&#039;s and Shinji&#039;s voice was ok, (unbiased opinion). Haruka&#039;s moms eyes were closed throughout the anime and she was the only one, I&#039;m not sure what to think about that. The soundtrack seemed to enhance the nostalgia the characters were felling and it was nice though sad.<br />
<br />
This anime is a great example that love is a sword that will either set someone free or hurt them with its sharpness.<br />

    Going into Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, I was a bit leery about watching ANOTHER dating-sim adaptation. The quality of dating-sim adaptations seem to vary between good and down right atrocious. For every Clannad, there is about 5 Majikois.  But its grandiose english translation, &quot;The Eternity you Desire,&quot; interested me enough to pick up the show. On the surface, this show might seem like a generic high school romance, but do not be fooled, the show is quite different from its synopsis. Very few anime have been able to make me feel such a whirlwind of emotions. Ranging from angry, to borderline major depression, KGNE

          <span style="display: none;" id="review109693">
        never fails to arouse strong feelings in the viewer. Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, although a flawed experience, is probably one of the most evocative romantic tragedies I have witnessed in anime.<br />
<br />
Story(6/10)- Kimi ga Nozomu Eien starts off like all dating sims usually do, in a high school setting. The first couple of episodes help to establish character relationships, their personalities and motivations. However, very early on in the story, tragedy befalls our main protagonists, and tone goes in a completely opposite direction. Surprisingly, the remaining bulk of the story takes place several years after the event, and shows the characters in their adult lives and how they were able to cope with tragedy. <br />
<br />
KGNE is by no means a &quot;philosophical,&quot; anime, however, what the show does is tests the nature and limit of human relationships. The question that essentially holds the show together is, &quot;Are my feelings truly genuine?&quot; And you will see characters constantly struggle to answer this question.<br />
<br />
 I found the show to be starkly realistic in many aspects, but completely unbelievable in others. And therein lies the major problem that KGNE has, the lack of realism in certain parts completely ruin the immersion. It reminded me that I was in fact watching an anime.  For example, the doctor in the hospital is constantly smoking indoors, and her medical advice made me question if she was actually a licensed professional.  Especially, when her medical advice unnecessarily causes more drama than needed. Another problem is the terrible comedic relief. It comes across as poorly written, juvenile, and inappropriate. For a show this dark, some good comic relief is needed but it is so bad it will probably depress you even more.<br />
<br />
Art(8/10)- The art surprisingly holds up well today. It doesn&#039;t compare to most of the anime released today, but it is watchable. <br />
<br />
Sound(9/10)- In dramatic shows, more importantly dramatic anime, the soundtrack is essential to pulling off tragic scenes. Clannad wouldn&#039;t have been as powerful if it were not for Jun Maeda&#039;s beautiful and saddening compositions. KGNE is also strong in this regard. The OST never failed to arouse feelings of depression and anxiety. <br />
<br />
Character(9/10)- Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien would be nothing without its strong cast of lead characters. The characters come across as real people, with real world problems as opposed to the flat 2D archetypes that populate anime. Yes, characters may act stupid, and illogical but it falls in line with their individual pathologies. No behavior is contrived, everything falls in line with their established character. Despite some uncaring, shallow and selfish acts, there is no &quot;bad,&quot; character. They all come across as real people trying to find happiness in a bad situation. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say I enjoyed the show, and I wouldn&#039;t hold it against KGNE, because it is a tragedy. Some parts where hard for me to watch, some parts were utterly soulcrushing, but that is why KGNE succeeds. It succeeds because, despite its flaws, despite its shortcomings, it made me feel something. It made me empathize with its characters, it made me feel sad and lonely. I was able to relate to every character in some capacity and that is an accomplishment worth merit. Now, some people will hate this show for it being depressing, or some parts coming off as melodramatic, and some will love it for the same exact reasons. I give Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien a 9/10 because the positives strongly outweighed the flaws in its story. <br />

    I&#039;m at a loss for words. No, seriously I just don&#039;t know where to start since after completing Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, I&#039;ve turned into an emotional wreck. I&#039;ll try though.<br />
<br />
This anime is without a shadow of a doubt, the best nerve-wrecking, jaw-dropping and brain-tangling drama I have seen. And it gets more and more distressing towards the end. It&#039;s as if you were sitting on a ticking bomb waiting to explode. At first you think &quot;cool I got plenty of time to defuse it&quot; but after some time you realise that you&#039;re not gonna make it on time. You start getting worried, you run

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41537">
        around and a few seconds before the explosion you shout in utter agony. That&#039;s basically what the viewer will feel like when watching Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. <br />
<br />
The focus of our drama is an adorable (but sinister) love triangle, comprised of the three main characters - Narumi Takayuki, Hayase Mitsuki and Suzumiya Haruka (not to be confused with Suzumiya Haruhi, who&#039;s a totaly different character altogether). Basically, Narumi meets Haruka. Haruka falls in love with him and they get intimate. One day however, Narumi&#039;s beloved girlfriend is involved in a traffic accident and falls into a coma.<br />
<br />
The real story begins from there. It follows the lifes of our main characters as the relationships between them change like leaves on wind. The viewers are captivated (I was at least) and want to know what happens next. Will Narumi and Haruka ever be together again? Will Narumi be faithful? Those are the kind of questions that everyone will have on their lips.<br />
<br />
The anime presents us with a lot of touching moments and the drama is at times, unbearable. Therefore I do not recommend this to anyone with a depression because... you&#039;ll just end up even more depressed. <br />
<br />
Sound and Art are pure brill, sad, depressive and melan-super-cholic. You should get some tissues because you&#039;ll be sobbing a lot throughout the series. Opening and ending is very good. I think I&#039;ll be getting the Kimi ga Nozomu Eien OST because it really impressed me.<br />
<br />
I would have given this series a 10 BUT one thing is completely messed up. The ending. For god&#039;s sake, I don&#039;t know what it is with good dramas and slice of life animes but they always have a screwed up ending. Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is no exception. The ending will disappoint you so horrendously that you won&#039;t even believe it. I won&#039;t say what&#039;s in the ending, if it&#039;s happy or not (I&#039;m not even sure which one it is actually, that&#039;s how badly they&#039;ve screwed up) but all I&#039;ll say is that they should have done a different one. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed it though. I like dramas to be honest, I like strong dramas and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien delivers. It&#039;s simply a story of how one person&#039;s accident can change lifes of so many other people. <br />
<br />
This series gets 9 out of 10 from me. I encourage everyone without a depression to watch it.

    Hi! Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews once again coming your way! This time we&#039;re looking at a doozy with this one! This series really pulls me in many different directions, and to be honest, half of me wants to give it a 6 or 7, and the other half wants to give it a 9 or even a 10. I just come away from it so conflicted and full of questions, yet still finding myself thinking about the series, which says something about my emotional investment in the show. So I do recommend this series to you guys, but know there&#039;s a big point or two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309711">
        that can affect your enjoyment, and that I&#039;m not exactly a fan of the ending, even though it did make sense to me. Will the RTLR wall of heartbreak get more covered? Let&#039;s take off at this thing like we were about to be hit by a car!<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
There&#039;s a spoiler that *has* to be discussed when it comes to this anime, and if you&#039;ve even glanced at any other reviews or such you likely know already: the tragedy mentioned in the synopsis is one girl getting hit by a car and slipping into a years long coma. This is important because there requires a large dose of logic leaping to support the story. This character, one of the love interests, regains consciousness after 3 years of being in a coma, her doctor decides it is in her best interest for everyone to keep the amount of time she&#039;s been out a secret to her. This is the setting for much of the dramatic content, and we absolutely have to accept this or else the whole thing falls apart. <br />
<br />
The issue is, however, that most of realize that this is by no means realistic. I&#039;ve never worked a hospital when I was a young man in the medical field, but I have worked many nursing homes with patients experiencing different forms of dementia. We were instructed to gently remind patients of where they were along with *when*. Now in practice we rarely held to this procedure as it tends to just upset the poor people, but it was even protocol in the old folks&#039; homes I&#039;ve been in. To believe a doctor in a hospital with a young patient would want everyone around her to lie to her is a little bit of  a stretch. <br />
<br />
She also is a little slow on the uptake, the young woman. She doesn&#039;t notice obvious changes in everyone around her that would indicate that it had been more than a few weeks since she was injured. While her parents might not look *too* much different, her little sister grows into a young woman in the time of her coma, and young ladies make some VERY obvious biological changes in their bodies during that age, to be delicate about it. Not to mention, the young woman does not notice for what seems to be a very long time that her hair is a great deal longer than before, and that she has lost a lot of weight in the in between. If you cannot accept that lying to a patient and not disclosing something so huge immediately is acceptable medical practices, then this is going to bug you to the point you&#039;ll likely not get any enjoyment from the series. This is a constant and central theme to the entire thing. This is what causes part of me to want to give a lower score. <br />
<br />
If you can roll with this punch, then you&#039;ll find a compelling story about a guy and two girls who are thrust by fate into a terrible situation and how they come to overcome and understand their true feelings. The gist of it is basically a girl (coma girl) wants to meet a boy (the MC) and so has her friend (the other girl in the situation) snuggle up to him and get to know him so that she can have a way &#039;in&#039; and meet him herself. This approach works, as the &#039;other girl&#039; does befriend the MC, and introduces the coma girl, who quickly confesses her feelings. The &#039;other girl&#039; and the MC have eyes for each other, but have nothing concrete. For the sake of her friend, &#039;other girl&#039; encourages the MC to date her. They are not together long, though they hit some major relationship milestones in that short time, before the accident happens. What follows is the story of a man that believes himself to be responsible for what happened to coma girl, and the guilt that wracks him and his life. Not knowing when, or even if, the coma girl would ever be who she once was, he begins to fall apart. The &#039;other girl&#039; is there, and helps him pick himself up in his time of need. Their interest in each other blooms into a full blown relationship and moves forward to the point of them considering living together. Yet, as this milestone for the couple rapidly approaches, coma girl suddenly wakes up, and believes herself to still be the high school girl dating the MC. This brings the MC back around to his guilt and feelings he had, only now he doesn&#039;t know who to turn to, who to love, and which way his life should go. Does he cling to the girl of his past? Or does he continue to move forward with the girl that helped him through that dark part of his life? <br />
<br />
Throw in the obvious repercussions that come with coma girl&#039;s friend being the one the MC moved on with, the sense of betrayal just being invited in there, and mix that with a little sister that has only a part of the whole picture whose feelings are involved too, and you end up with a bit of a mess. The MC is hated on by many, but I truly recommend giving him a shot before passing judgement. I think he&#039;s really trying his best to be kind to everyone, the series itself points this out, and he just wants to do well by everyone involved, but there&#039;s no easy way out of the situation. He isn&#039;t an ass, he&#039;s a guy that has been caught in a serious bind by fate. He can&#039;t really bring himself to dump the coma girl, I mean, damn how cold do you have to be to break up with someone in that condition? Though it would have been probably for the best, he doesn&#039;t hate the girl, in fact he blames himself for her even being there in the first place. He just wants to do right by her. But by doing so, he has to deal with the feelings he&#039;s causing in the &#039;other girl&#039;. <br />
<br />
The tale follows the lines laid by those events, as hearts are broken, feelings are crushed, and souls left to yearn over what might have been, or for what could still be. It&#039;s an intense journey where you sometimes want to scream at the screen for him to do a certain thing with a certain one of the girls, yet if you sit back and think, you might find yourself feeling I do, that more than anything I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not him, as I couldn&#039;t have gotten out of the situation either without hurting someone. And the MC, like so many of us, just really wants to keep from doing that very thing: hurting either of the girls. Yet sometimes when you try to save the world, you end up saving no one. <br />
<br />
The story made me gasp a few times, beg the characters to do or not do certain things, and even misted up my eyes a few times as you realize there are no true &#039;bad guys&#039; in the situation, just people having feelings and trying to live through them without hurting the people they care about most. I think about the situations, and I tell ya, I can understand how the MC was just trying to spare everyone&#039;s feelings, but in his indecisiveness he ended up doing the very thing he was trying to avoid. As he is told, sometimes being kind is cruel. Fitting. <br />
<br />
If you have no interest in feelings or that kind of thing, obviously pass. This isn&#039;t high school based either, no matter what some of the pictures portray. The majority of the events happen well after graduating, though coma girl for a long while isn&#039;t aware of this. This has a real world feeling to it, and has real world reactions. It isn&#039;t a simple thing, to untangle the feelings involved, the guilt, the feelings of responsibility, the desire for what the heart truly wants, and how love grows, regardless of all of those things at times. It is gripping, saddening at times, and triumphant at others. This is the part of me that wants to grade the score higher. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
This is old school, through and through. We&#039;re talking about a series that ended, what, 15 years ago? Of course it looks old because it *is* old. The classic style art is fine, it just is that: classic styled. Which was the in thing to do back in those days. There&#039;s nothing wrong with the art at all, I&#039;m just honestly not a fan. I didn&#039;t find anything to detract from it per se, I just have a harder time with older titles, and this is no exception. I find art to be highly subjective, so don&#039;t let this particular section hold too much influence. I do admit I did lose the sense of watching animation especially as I got deeper into the series. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The sound effects are well done. The voice acting is very pleasing to the ear. I think I found Akane&#039;s voice work very interesting, as she seemed to be the one to carry the most anger (with one humorous exception) and when she lashes out, it sounds right to me. The MC is a little wishy washy sounding, but that fits because most of what he says is wishy washy, as that&#039;s kind the core of his character, his desire to shield everyone somehow. The coma girl sounds younger than the &#039;other girl&#039; via the use of a higher pitched voice actor. That was a good call, as the more mature girl gives a great performance as well. The only oddity would be the &#039;other girl&#039;s older sounding voice in the few early episodes, but firstly we&#039;re not in that time frame long enough to notice, and secondly, it&#039;s not that obvious until later. I didn&#039;t catch the use of tone of voice to augment the story of &#039;lost time&#039; until nearly the end of the series. I just was a bit impressed when I realized the way they even used voices to illustrate the time element of the story. The only thing that is a little grating is the voice of a coworker the MC works with at the diner, and that&#039;s on purpose as a comedic relief character. <br />
<br />
The background music is nice and floaty, as you would expect from a fairly serious romance series. The piano work is nice, and the themes fit well enough. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll play them without watching the series, but they weren&#039;t out of place by any means.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I really found myself invested in this show, especially as it came to a close. There is a slight bit of slow pacing in the beginning, even a little close to halfway through, but after the &#039;other girl&#039; starts to come undone, it really steams forward to the ending. I found myself wanting to do the old &#039;one more episode&#039; so that&#039;s always an indication that I&#039;m wrapped up in the story. The only thing that gets me, and if you have ever read any of my reviews you can likely guess what I&#039;m about to say, is the ending. There is a level of ambiguity to the ending that drove me to near madness. The girl he ends up with is heavily implied, but not clearly stated, as far as I&#039;m concerned. It had what I consider a more &#039;muted&#039; ending. I would have LOVED to have it ending with a wedding, but it was not to be. I love grand romantic statements and movements, but as I&#039;ve said before, I think that&#039;s a cultural thing. It seems here in the west (in my part of America at least) a desire to see the &#039;happily ever after&#039; stated plainly. We seem to live for that moment the lovers run into each other&#039;s arms and fall to their knees kissing in the rain. Eastern cultures, in anime at least, seems to end more often on a note that is much quieter and introspective. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s fine of course, it is just the difference on how people in different cultures see things. The Eastern cultures seem to be far more adept with the idea of all things having a time and place, and eventually an end. We Westerners seem far more into &#039;love is forever&#039; and that kind of tenacious holding onto what we love. So there&#039;s no &#039;chick-flick&#039; ending, but the ending we are given is acceptable. I just wanted to see something &#039;bigger&#039;.<br />
<br />
My problem is that of the &#039;romantic&#039; anime when I first started watching was that I stumbled across Strawberry Panic, which DOES have the grand ending. Ended up setting my expectations to something that doesn&#039;t seem to happen so often in the rest of anime. I&#039;ll get over it, I still loved the story and will accept the ending given. Begrudgingly, however!<br />
<br />
Best Girl: Daikuuji Ayu, the waitress from the diner where the MC works that is constantly screaming obscenities at the MC. My favorite? &quot;I hope you step in cat shit!&quot; If I had to be completely serious, I would say Akane, as a good deal of her issues is sadly because she&#039;s not informed of everything going on, which is very sad because those things pain her a great deal. <br />
<br />
I say spin this one, and for sure watch episode 4 before passing judgement as after the accident there is a huge shift in the way things go down. This is a story about pain and loss, and how people react and move on, and of course what happens when everything you thought you&#039;d gotten over comes back into your life like a hurricane. I think many of us would try to do right by everyone like our MC does, but I pray we would meet with more success than he did. To quote the incomparable Alice Cooper: &quot;Love is a loaded gun&quot;. I say let your heart rumble! Thumbs up, though no new RTLR wall entries. See you guys for the OVA!

    Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien is an anime series that&#039;s not widely known (hence why I watched it so late after its release) but I found it to be surprisingly good. It may be only 14 episodes, but it manages to tell a good story and introduces to us characters that are realistic and with whom we can easily relate with. <br />
<br />
Although the first episodes make it seem like a story about high school life for a group of friends, from then on it goes downhill and we are shown how a cruel accident can change everything and the consequences that result from this. It becomes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22680">
        an emotional drama in which the main character, Takayuki, must choose from one of the two love interests he has in the series. However, his indecisiveness and knowledge that whoever he doesn&#039;t pick might get hurt, only leads to more hurt and trouble for everyone involved.<br />
<br />
As you watch this series you&#039;ll end up supporting one of the two female leads, but even if the one you choose does end up with Takayuki, it&#039;s really easy to feel sorry for the other person as both of them are nice people and both love him a lot. This series does have a large supporting cast, but aside from a friend of the trio and the younger sister of one of the girls, they aren&#039;t really important in terms of the storyline.<br />
<br />
The ending is done really well, with a great song that fits the theme of the series perfectly. It shows what happens to the main characters afterwards, and I&#039;m glad that even for the losing party she seems to have a bright future ahead of her. <br />
<br />
All in all, Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien is a flawed series (slow pacing in some parts/ lots of crying from some characters/ bad decisions being made which are hard to understand), but it explores a lot of human themes, revolves around some well-developed characters, and manages to draw you in until you finish the series to see the outcome for yourself.

    Having watched a fair deal of romance/tragedy anime series and knowing fair well that this was not going to be a happy unending, I was unconvinced of the storyline bridging what appears to be a forced romantic relationship between Takayuki and Mitsuki. Even if the romance is fictional, honestly it jumped around from completely awkward and unromantic moments to kissing and sex. <br />
<br />
Not my main argument, but the general lack of character development, coupled with the unnatural story development right from the beginning turned me off. The arc fast forward a few years after the accident in episode 4 sees Takayuki and Haruka together as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25879">
        a couple just did not follow well, neither did the introduction of other characters. Therefore I don&#039;t understand the rave reviews to be honest and just had to give my opinion on this. Other than that, the art and music was fairly done in the series.

    If you like drama this is it hands down. This indeed is a slice of life more revolving around romance. It has all the twists and turns you&#039;d find in a drama. The best part is how you really get to know the characters in 14 episodes. The dialogue is very well done, and every line is a shot throguh the heart. One thing is for sure whether you&#039;ll like the anime or not you wont stop watching to see what happens next.

    &quot;Being too kind is also cruel.&quot;  this may be true in a love triangle. Eventhough KGNE is a romance/drama anime, you will find it focusing more on realism or a slice of life type.<br />
<br />
Imagine yourself a lover, a loved one, a sister,a friend, someones who wants to achieve something in life, or in short what any normal person would be. this anime portays such characters and the circumstances due a love triangle that they must overcome.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for an anime that touches your heart and involves real life experiences in relationships, this will take you through an epic series of emotional rides,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17025">
        at the same time, leaving you to raise questions in every part. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend this to anyone.  KGNE is no doubt one of the best animes when it comes to either romance, drama or slice of life genre. Expect to being feeling depressed when you watch this anime, along with a beautiful ed song.<br />
<br />
