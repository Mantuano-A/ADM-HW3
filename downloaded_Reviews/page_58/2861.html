    Kaze no Stigma is a fun anime if you&#039;re interested into this genre. Battles, magic, comedy, kick-ass moments, KnS has it all.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is fair, not really impressive since for me it was predictable towards the end. The &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; plot starts later in the series as the first 3/4 is filled with random missions and somewhat fillers like hotspring episodes and so on. Even though the lack of main plot overall disappointed me, I found the story overall satisfying.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The characters are very nicely drawn, you can clearly see this is a 2007 anime. Effects are good, from flames to wind and other unleashed powers; plus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review923">
        the characters are drawn good enough for any fan to enjoy the art.  Even though it&#039;s no better than other 2007 animes, it clearly has it&#039;s own attractiveness for me. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Not much to comment on this area, the sound is fair enough, soundtrack fits the mood all of the time and the opening song is quite catchy once you listen to it. I liked the idea of two ending songs/sequences since it changed with the atmosphere of the episode. Overall it was fine with me.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters were great, I loved them. KnS has it all: the tsundere, the athlete, the rich lady (from America, though speaks English like hell), the lolita and so on. To my surprise, the guys have cool personalities as well, the main lead taking the title of one of the most kick-ass characters, you&#039;re gonna like his style. Nothing else to say here, the characters are probably the strong point of this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Well, as I said, unless you&#039;re into magic, combat and ecchi shots from time to time, you&#039;re probably not gonna find anything interesting. However, if you like magic battles you&#039;ll find this anime cool, plus the characters and some of the situations make the 24 episodes worth the time. I really enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall I rounded up to around 8. I think it was pretty great and I don&#039;t regret seeing it. The main lead remains one of my favorite characters. It&#039;s a good thing they have an open end so I really hope for a sequel. That&#039;s about it.

    I started this thinking &amp;quot;alas, another predictable action anime which I may end up dropping&amp;quot; but it had me sucked in to the very end. The reasons? I&#039;ll try to explain:<br />
<br />
Storyline: 8.5/10<br />
Most action fans would see the storyline as very cliched and predictable, having seen it all played out before. It&#039;s storyline does lack, with some filler episodes (such as amusement park visits and hot bath days), and random bad guys which pop up, get defeated, and so moves on to another scenario. However, even though it does lack originality, it&#039;s done well and to a good enough standard to enjoy watching it all unravel.<br />
<br />
Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5226">
        7.5/10<br />
In one angle, the characters are done well, as your average anime. Not brilliant, but not too bad either. However, sometimes the backgrounds (such as on a busy street) are at a stand-still which is noticeable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5/10<br />
Again, your average action themes running though it, which aren&#039;t brilliant, but not too bad either. At the very least they don&#039;t get annoying or anything, and stay well positioned in the background.<br />
<br />
Character: 9.5/10<br />
At this point, you&#039;re probably thinking why the heck you should watch this anime. Well the secret to it all, which sets it apart from others and keeps you watching, is the characters. The characters themselves are likeable and fit in with the general mood of the anime (some-what cute comedy moments but gets serious when they need to). In one angle they do seem a bit cliched, the average stubborn bad-tempered in-denial girl with the cheeky cold-yet-nice guy but has a dark past, plus the extra nice-but-serious-when-needs-to-be little guy. But the development of the characters, and the development of the romance between the two main protagonists is what really sets it apart. You are kept glued to the screen and get awarded appropriately in the little delightful developments in every episode, and you grow to love every minute. Not to mention the various twists and turns as well, (with added drama) which keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
Sure it&#039;s all been done before, sure it&#039;s not mind-blowingly good, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It was a secure anime to watch and enjoy ~ having everything from love triangles, nice friendships, happy-happy-days-of-fun, comedy moments, love; but also drama, action: all balanced perfectly.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.5/10<br />
Overall, it was a good watch, and those who are into romance/action types will surely enjoy this.

    Kaze no Stigma I believe had a lot of potential. It started off interesting, not entirely compelling but interesting. Then it went downhill faster than I could write this review. There was also another thing that bothered me, which was the way they handled deaths. When someone not particularly important died, the main characters just shoved it past their shoulders and act like nothing happened. Human life doesn&#039;t seem to hold much importance here(particularly to the heroine). Then again what was I expecting? It wasn&#039;t entirely an disappointment, I didn&#039;t expect much from it but I didn&#039;t expect it to be this bad. <br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31791">
        doesn&#039;t exist. There was a few tidbits of potential at the story but I have to say it just dragged on to different story lines that ended predictably. <br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
Kazuma to me was the only likable person there. If I looked past the fan service and pretty art, he was the only one remotely interesting. Everyone else seemed like filler characters. <br />
<br />
Ayano to me, was extremely annoying. Whenever something went wrong, it was automatically Kazuma&#039;s fault. Especially at the first episode when she disobeyed orders and followed Kazuma which had two people killed. She is irrisponsible, short tempered and incredibly flawed. I did not find a single redeeming factor about her character. And really, screaming Kazuma at pretty much every single episode was not an attractive trait what so ever. <br />
<br />
Ren is someone I wanted to like, and I admired his peaceful personality in contrast to Ayano&#039;s. But he ended up somewhat annoying with his seriously childish antics, and the only time I appreciated him was when he was being useful. <br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Average, the OP and ED were truly nothing special. I could forget them and not miss them one bit. That said they weren&#039;t that bad, could be a lot better but if it had been any worse, I might have started crying. <br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Probably the highlight of it all, and even then it&#039;s not that entirely impressive as it lacks personality. Shiny art is shiny, but shininess doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s amazing.  Like a higher quality of a mediocre show. While the characters are pretty, the backgrounds are really unmemorable. The action scenes are visually pleasing but not very engaging.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
I really did not enjoy it very much. It lacked so much that even if I didn&#039;t take it seriously, it was still rather bad to me. The execution of the story was terrible. <br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
I would not recommend it. That said I&#039;m sure a lot of people would enjoy this type of anime. It has magic, romance and all the shoujo elements that tweens would like. It just wasn&#039;t my cup of tea. I couldn&#039;t take it seriously and even the funny parts weren&#039;t all that funny, I found myself smiling at best but most of the time I was just waiting for the episode to end.

    A friend highly recommended Kaze no Stigma to me one day, so I finally got around to watching it. While it was entertaining, I was disappointed with the anime as a whole. It didn&#039;t match up to the high recommendation I had received. However, I do appreciate the fun, entertaining aspect.<br />
Story: It was interesting, but not well done. Many things were highly predictable, but I do love the concept of element magic-users and whatnot. <br />
Art: Fair art; some things did not flow well, and just in general, the art is simple. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn&#039;t enjoy all the fight scenes due

          <span style="display: none;" id="review141117">
        to animations. <br />
Sound: Nothing amazing, nothing to complain about. (:<br />
Character: The characters didn&#039;t connect with me much. They felt too shallow. Nevertheless, they were likable.<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it enough to be happy about finishing it, but it&#039;s not very memorable. It&#039;s a good anime to watch if you&#039;re looking for a simple entertainment anime. Just don&#039;t expect for it to be a favorite (in my opinion, at least).<br />
Hope I helped!

    Kaze no Stigma has been brought up by me several times as one of my most despised anime, but I&#039;ve never really had a chance to say why, partly because it came out during a time when light novel adaptations were considered good and any that actually weren&#039;t were purged from the collective hive mind that is anime fandom - barring the occasional fanboy who still tries to claim that Kazuma is someone that protagonists should look up to. I saw it during a time when Bakemonogatari was airing, so you can imagine it took a lot to make me hate something when I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179265">
        still buying Kanon and Shana DVDs unironically. I don&#039;t remember how I found out about the show beyond random Youtube searches back when you could actually watch anime there, but I remember thinking it seemed like a cool urban fantasy and instead got &quot;why why why WHYYYYYY?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Whilst Sword Art Online and Mahouka are now considered the poster-boys for &quot;Gary-Stu fanfiction/wish-fulfillment LN crap that&#039;s not even well-animated&quot;, Kaze no Stigma was doing everything it did back in 2007 aka &quot;the golden year of anime that wasn&#039;t actually so golden when you look at it closely&quot; and whilst I&#039;d hesitate to determine if it&#039;s worse than either, it&#039;s the one that I hate the most largely because of the &quot;shock&quot;. You know what I mean. The &quot;shock&quot; when you&#039;re a newbie who&#039;s optimistic about everything, unaware of what the dark side is truly capable of, and when you go in without any preparation you get backlashed so hard to the point that you can actually press charges against the creators. This is why I go into practically every anime with no expectations whatsoever. Because quite frankly, the &quot;shock&quot; is something I can do without for the rest of my already miserable life.<br />
<br />
The story is centered on Kazuma, a kid who was banished from his family because his female cousin was able to wield magic without setting herself on fire and burning all her clothes off - which isn&#039;t nearly as positive as it sounds - and thus goes away for a few years only to return as a stock cocky douche who wields wind magic like Jesus on steroids. His reunion coincides with another wind user killing off his family and rather than do much to clear his name, he arrogantly takes them on, including his cousin (Ayano) who has grown into a beautiful sword-wielding babe so you know what&#039;s going to happen to her before the first half of the premiere even concludes. Other characters include Kazuma&#039;s brother (Ren), who sounds like a prepubescent kid who smoked too many marlboros, and his dad (don&#039;t remember the name and don&#039;t care to look it up), who gets hospitalized very early on due to father/son differences that I refuse to describe because I don&#039;t want to spend much more effort into hating this show than the creators did in its overall quality.<br />
<br />
This admittedly is difficult to do because the main problem with this show, along with the reason I hate it so much, is that it&#039;s completely unimaginative in every single way imaginable (no pun intended). The anime was made by Gonzo post-Welcome to the NHK and that&#039;s pretty much all you need to know regarding the production values as well as the overall quality. But even if Kenji Nakamura was set to direct this show, you&#039;d need a complete overhaul of the original source material to make up for writing this phenomenally bad. That story premise I mentioned above gets resolved within the first four episodes and then succumbs to light novel syndrome of padding out the time with lower quality story arcs, and considering how awful the first story arc, that&#039;s saying a whole lot. Now I never actually finished this show - get your mouse cursor away from that &quot;x-mark&quot; - but I have had some exposure to what I never gave a proper chance and my god it&#039;s like the writer wasn&#039;t even trying to make the very premise of their story interesting.<br />
<br />
One story arc is centered on a girl wanting to kill Kazuma to the point that she&#039;d sell her own soul to darkness, which made her the most sympathetic character on the show until her redemption at the end because she was nice to Kazuma as a kid and he even confirms himself that yes, that little thing was all she needed to do for him to care about her. Another one focuses on Jun trying to protect a girl he fell in love with after a five-minute at best playground romp only to discover she&#039;s an artificial human with limited time, leading to another vomit-inducing conclusion. There&#039;s even an arc where an American chick comes and falls for Kazuma because she&#039;s under the impression he has a nine-inch cock when in reality, it&#039;s (censored, but I assure you it&#039;s a small number) inches long. If mediocrity was an Olympic event, it&#039;d get unanimous tens all across the board.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s even an arc where Kazuma has to suppress a super powered dark side, which is meant to be the overlying plot that connects the various stories together, that has no weight to it because A) it actually makes him weaker, so I dunno why he has it to begin with B) he&#039;s so much of a hypocritical asshole as is that there&#039;s practically no contrast. Literally every second he&#039;s on-screen is a second that I want to steal his powers and go all Texas Chainsaw Massacre with them on his face, because the writer just can&#039;t seem to write his &quot;loner with a heart of gold who gets all the ladies, seems to always know what&#039;s going on, and never gets so much as a scratch on him throughout the entire show&quot; character consistently and decide whether his facade is an act or not. Not that the other characters are much better, being shallow stock stereotypes who wear the same outfit to the point that Ayano had to decide between four identical school uniforms to wear to a date, but at least they&#039;re straight-forward and actually get dirt on their faces (which says a lot about the show&#039;s quality when that&#039;s the best you have to say for them).<br />
<br />
And of course it wouldn&#039;t be a wish-fulfillment Gary Stu story without awful action scenes that looked like they were conceived and choreographed by interns for the janitor position. They use the same stock footage of Ayano summoning her sword almost every single episode and it doesn&#039;t even work on the bad guys 95% of the time, which makes her even less competent than Asuna or Miyuki and ain&#039;t that a sad truth? Kazuma&#039;s wind powers are so cheap both in practice and in a visual sense that he doesn&#039;t even have to move in order to use them, which is pretty much the triple-threat of boring action right there.<br />
<br />
Not that he moves during the non-action scenes either. I recall one episode where he, Ayano, and a bunch of her friends explore the school late at night and make the girls perform lame comedic routines whilst he just smiles without revealing the truth because we needed the plot to go on for an entire episode because we have two cours to fill and we don&#039;t have the brains to fill them with anything more meaningful.<br />
<br />
Well I refuse to be the kettle that calls this show black, Gonzo, so I&#039;m ending this review of your uninspired mess right now before my own imagination is sucked dry from this black hole (I don&#039;t see myself as a kettle, so I feel no hypocrisy in calling Kaze no Stigma that) of banal story, characters, animation, music, and even author existence - the writer of the original light novels passed away before he could finish the series - that in retrospect, I shouldn&#039;t have rediscovered in the first place.

    One of the most generic, predictable anime I&#039;ve seen.  Kaze no Stigma uses the slightly underused approach of magic users and ninja clans in modern times, but, surprisingly, it&#039;s not meant to be wacky or childish like other anime of its genre.  This gave me high hopes, and I remember catching myself thinking, during the first few episodes &quot;this will really have to take a turn for the worse to prevent me from finishing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
After sitting through cliché episode after cliché episode, I finally dropped it.  While I like the main hero, Yagami Kazuma, the heroin, Kannagi Ayano is what ruined the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160987">
        series for me.  Not only does her Japanese voice actress kinda suck in this role, her &#039;burn run time transformation-esque&#039; summoning of Enraiha against every little thing really pissed me off.  She never fights using just fire magic, and, despite an early youma kill that was supposed to display her adept fighting abilities, she spends 90% of her time being a decoy, getting defeated, getting caught, and, like any romantic comedy anime, blaming the male lead for her shortcomings.  She&#039;s childish, weak, poor-sounding, but well drawn.<br />
<br />
The animation is up to par, but everything else could have been done so much better; Kaze no Stigma is a testament to the old saying &quot;All that glitters is not gold&quot;.

    A somewhat decent Action, Romance with demons and the 4 elements. This anime is enjoyable to watch but it really lacks originality. ^_^<br />
<br />
From the very first episode, the story is really easy to understand because there is nothing all that new about the premise. It is just the typical story of a boy and girl that team up to defeat the bad guys that randomly show up. From here it continues with the random mini adventures and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really try to do anything special about it, so hardcore anime fans will feel like they have seen it all before. You may begin to wonder

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1298">
        why you should even continue watching this anime if it is just like this however the story does kick off, in the latter half of the series. Even the pointless episodes are really fun to watch but what&amp;rsquo;s better are the little developments in some characters, though the ending is somewhat predictable.<br />
<br />
For the characters we have Kazuma Yagami, a sort of anti-hero who became incredibly strong after being disowned by his dad. He is probably the most interesting character in the series; because he is a very understandable, with a distinguished personality that is brought out by the superb voice acting. And this cannot be an action romance anime without the typical &amp;quot;Tsundere&amp;quot;, Ayano Kannagi. There are more characters but they are really insignificant that they can be easily overlooked.<br />
<br />
The quality of Kaze no Stigma&amp;rsquo;s animation is pretty hard to judge. At one stand point we have: some well animated fight scenes, some well-placed CG and good ecchi moments. Yet half the time the animation looks cheap with: some poor character designs (mostly bad guys), tacky effects and no movement coming from the background. <br />
<br />
The music is really weak and there are only a few notable tunes that allow it to redeem itself. Although during the fights, or even in normal conversations, there is two female characters that can be both funny and annoying to listen to (Ayano &amp;amp; Katherine).<br />
<br />
Overall this proved to be a very enjoyable anime with plenty of laughs, most of those laughs are thanks to the great odd couple. Nevertheless there is nothing about this series that allows it to stand out, in the action romance category; unlike the popular Full Metal Panic! or the Shakugan no Shana series. But don&amp;rsquo;t let that deter you from watching this anime.<br />
<br />

    Imagine an anime where certain people have discovered how to magically control fire, wind, earth and water. One of them is Kazuma Yagami, a former member of the Kannagi clan, a group that uses fire. After being abandoned by his family, friends and clan for his inability to use fire, Kazuma returns to his clan, now a wind magic user. Believing him to be a traitor for his use of wind magic, the clan falsely accuses Kazuma of killing off members of their clan. It is now up to Kazuma to clear his name and hopefully regain the trust of his family. Add this story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19402">
        with a voice casting of screaming people, storytelling that leaves you with pointless information, the most unlikable cast of characters seen on the screen and you get the wretched project known as Stigma of the Wind, Junichi Sakata&#039;s latest entry (and failure) in the anime library.<br />
<br />
While the story starts off with an interesting premise, it takes a nosedive after the third episode. It unfortunately tries to be a mystery, romance, drama, action, horror and comedy at the same time, causing lots of confusion and missed plot opportunities. Whether it be some random guy pretending to be an angel (I&#039;m serious), or a guy licking wine off of someone&#039;s cheek, the show seems to reject anything normal in favor of complete chaos and anarchy. This wouldn&#039;t be a problem, except that nothing about these moments are funny. It&#039;s just insulting to the viewer&#039;s intelligence, since they paid the insane price of $50 for part one of the first season. <br />
<br />
The characters are annoying and overacted, with the exception of the main character, Kazuma Yagami, who is calm and collected. A perfect example would be Ayano Kannagi the truth. Ayano reluctantly becomes an ally of Kazuma. Unfortunately, the first few lines in the pilot episode is her shouting, &quot;I hate the wind!&quot;, giving the viewer a clear indication that she is going to be overacted in every possible sense of the word. Kazuma&#039;s relative, Ren Kannagi, is also a bit batty, but it&#039;s shocking when the viewer discovers halfway throughout the series that he is in fact a boy. Everything that Ren does, from the way he looks, to the feminine personality he has, gives you the false impression that he is a girl in the first place. Top all of this off with the fact that each character has their own annoying voice, making this one of the worst gang of animated characters ever to grace DVD.<br />
<br />
If there is one aspect the series gets right, it&#039;s the artwork. Each frame of animation is extremely polished, with impressive animations, solid character design and a very clean look. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t do anything remotely unique, which is a missed opportunity, as the clean animation would have allowed plenty of successful innovation.<br />
<br />
Stigma of the Wind isn’t the worst anime I have seen, but it sure is a messy one. The director really should have spent more time developing each character. Instead we get characters that scream at each other for no reason, constantly whine annoyingly and act in an incredibly illogical manner. It&#039;s not like this is cheap entertainment either, as it cost $100 for the first season, stopping me from ever recommending this to anyone. Please stay away, as dissatisfaction is the only result that will occur after wasting money on this lamentable product.

    Well, first let&#039;s be honest, I have only watched 1 episode of this anime so in the end I could change my overall rating to the entire different location. From a 7 to a 1 for instance, hey! It could happen! Making a review is pretty hard to do when there was only 1 episode which I have watched.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Let&#039;s look at the basic shall we? First there is a clan, called the Kannagi family. This are all Fire Mages, but one of them isn&#039;t cut out to become a Fire Mage. And seems to have better use for the Wind instead of Fire. So far,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266">
        the story I given a 7... as I think if it is progressing quit a way it could become really interesting. But so far, I haven&#039;t really counted this one in the Overall Score as well.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
Well, animation is pretty hard to describe every time in my opinion. I think that an anime serie where you can see what is going on scores high in animation, also if the looks of the characters are good (most important in anime; EYES). In the serie &amp;quot;Kaze No Stigma&amp;quot; you instantly see everything you are suppose to see. There is no: &amp;quot;What the f*ck is going on, I can&#039;t see anything&amp;quot; and the light is good enough to enjoy. So it get&#039;s a 8, since it is very good. (not perfect, so far, there hasn&#039;t been a single anime I found perfect animation)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Sounds are fair, I guess ... but nog enough for a 6 however. The OST is good and has some extra atmosphere in the serie. When it&#039;s talking you see, you hear a mysterieus tune, when it is action you see you also hear a good background music to match with the action. I found the background music almost as appealing as another anime called &amp;quot;Claymore&amp;quot;. I give it a 7 in this mark.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This is the thing that is absolutely impossible to rate like this after seeing 1 episode. You haven&#039;t know the characters quit as good, for to know a character you need to watch about 10 episodes (or 5 if it is a miniserie such as Hellsing). I just give it a 7, as I predict these characters will become pretty awesome at the end... but this is just A GAMBLE!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed the anime &amp;quot;Kaze No Stigma&amp;quot; a lot. So hey... why I given it a 9? Because it is simply that fun to see. But again, it is in most of the time the first episode is the most best one. So I counted this out of the overall score.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
&amp;quot;Kaze No Stigma&amp;quot; is fun to watch ... I don&#039;t think I have nothing else to tell you about why I given this anime a 7. So I just leave it with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also again, keep in mind that I only watched 1 episode! Maybe there is already episode 2 out and becoming avaible for download, but I wrote it at the time there was only 1 episode. But still, this anime could become REALLY interesting. My opinion on the end is that if you liked Claymore... I think you can also enjoy this anime. Except this one isn&#039;t in the middle ages.<br />

Edits:<br />
Date: 24 april 2007<br />
Changes: Reread it and fixed some mistakes. For instance, the overall rating was 7, not 8 as I said in the intro at the time. This problem is removed!<br />
<br />
Date: 24 april 2007<br />
Changes: Finally found the codes to make it bold, italic and/or underline... I was always trying [B] and [/B] ... seems like it could only work in lower case.

    I really didn&#039;t like this show. I&#039;m sorry. But it had a hype to it when I first read the summary (yet not any reviews, unfortunately). The characters were monotonous, the fight scenes were hard to follow and sporadic, the storyline was okay, but could have been better portrayed, and it was just an overall weird show. Wooden sword that catches fire? Not the weirdest I&#039;ve ever seen, but still... Wood? They coulda done better. A lot better. Nuff said.

    Kaze no Stigma for me has a near to perfect setting to how the male protagonist is shown...starts weak, banished, but then returns as a badass master that rivals the best.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound:<br />
I liked the explosive sound effects for the powers being from Kazuma&#039;s power up wind ability to the explosive crashes of buildings sliced in halve.  By the same token the look of the magic used especially the elements of fire make it awe inspiring to watch...nearly artistic in my opinion<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
What made me fall in love with this anime series is the english dub for the Kazuma and his choice of sarcastic words,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27757">
        very commonly main protagonists that have super power but either look clueless or dumbfounded when a situation occurs and rely on luck to pull through; however Kazuma&#039;s character I think is perfect since I like how he teases some of the other characters, pull off some awesome attacks and still have time to show a heart to those he cares for....despite his sarcasm<br />
<br />
I loved it all and I hope there are a few more like it out there in the anime world<br />
9/10

    Ah, with the wonderful story of Kaze no Stigma fresh in my mind, I believe now is the perfect time to write a review for how I wasted my day.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
Well, the story, nothing special, but not too bad. Mediocre is the perfect word to describe it. I&#039;m not going to go too in depth with it, but I had high hopes upon reading about an overpowered person who comes back to a family who disowned him. To me, sounded pretty good, so I gave it ago. A few flaws. Earliest flaw I noticed was the fights, which might just be me, but the fights

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190183">
        either took three quarters of the episode or thirty seconds. Now, I don&#039;t like fights where it takes a long time, but I certainly don&#039;t like thirty second over-hyped moments. The second flaw I noticed with the story is that later in the story, which may be a spoiler, is that when Kazuma goes hatred mode and is suppose to get more powerful, which they showcase well, as soon as Ayano interferes, Kazuma is super weak. I just... I just don&#039;t get it. Alright, spoiler over. There were a few more minor flaws I had with the story, but they weren&#039;t necessary to add.<br />
<br />
Art: 4<br />
I&#039;m not exactly sure how to rate the art, but compared to earlier ones it was mediocre. The reason it&#039;s a four and not five is because the fanservice they tried to add was a miserable failure. There&#039;s really no other way to put it. They had quite a bit of pantsu shots, and I don&#039;t mind fanservice. As a male, I even encourage it. Just kidding, for the most part. But the problem with this particular fanservice was that the panties were just kind of like... there. I don&#039;t think I am allowed to post links here, so I won&#039;t, but the panties didn&#039;t have any... what&#039;s the word, I guess, depth. The creators could have just added another line in the middle to make it slightly arousing, but no, nope, nah.  The other thing that bothered me about Ayano was her clothes. I think she&#039;s seen once out of her generic school uniform.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Personally I didn&#039;t like the opening, or the outro, which both sounded as generic as the characters, but it&#039;s really just an opinion, I guess.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
You know, this was one of the most &quot;okay&quot; things of the show. Like, generic overpowered main character? Alright. Generic tsundere? Hm, okay. But then there was one that brought back trauma to me specifically. That character was Ren. What trauma, you may ask? Only the scariest of scary. It was... Boku no Pico. I mean seriously, I was willing to sweep the fact that Ren looked almost identical to Pico under the rug. But no, f**king no, they had to make two, I repeat, TWO, scenes of Pico, I mean, Ren, massaging Juugo, which wouldn&#039;t have been too bad if it wasn&#039;t for him grunting and Ren straddling him and rubbing. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
I enjoyed this show, with an exception, which I will discuss below. This show, again, I genuinely enjoyed it. There were moments of actual hype and whatnot. I did enjoy the romance, until it was super forced with that McDonald girl. Why give a character the last name McDonald when she eats in a WcDonald? She came from America? Is Japan getting at something here? Well, I&#039;m getting off track, so I&#039;ll skip to the overall now.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
Now, if you&#039;ve made it this far, you&#039;re probably wondering, why is the overall a four? I&#039;ll tell you why. The ending. If the ending wasn&#039;t so bad, I would easily give this overall a six. Let me tell you why the ending was so bad.<br />
***SPOILERS BELOW***<br />
Firstly, the ending battle, the giant shadow hole? A demon climbing out of it? A giant magic circle? Where have I seen this before? Secondly, the romance, one of the few things of this show that I really found good. I was hoping that they would kiss on the final episode. Did they? Nope. What did they do? F**king generic overpowered character summons a wind to push her hair back towards him. Could have been really cute, I guess. What does Kazuma do with Ayano&#039;s hair? He grabs it, and during this whole time Ayano is blushing like crazy, and smells her hair. And he gets into it, man. He goes f**king hardcore. He follows it up by a pat on Ayano&#039;s butt. Who says romance is dead? The closest thing they get in this show to a kiss is a lick on Ayano&#039;s face.<br />
***SPOILERS ENDED***<br />
<br />
Yeah, so, in needless to say, if you&#039;re bored and have the entire day to do nothing, watch it. Otherwise, go watch somethin&#039; else.<br />

    I can’t tell, why exactly I picked up this show. No, seriously, why did I? Maybe I wanted to see a big load of crispy action paired with a bit of romance and some comedy. I can’t say that I didn’t receive all of that. I had my fun with Kaze no Stigma, but I actually should’ve avoided this show. I’m going to tell why.<br />
<br />
Story  (5/10)<br />
The story of Kaze no Stigma is divided in a few arcs. We got to see some entirely comedic episodes, some episodes focused on investigation and few ones with a highly serious undertone. Yep, there is pretty much no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183476">
        major story arc in Kaze no Stigma. Don’t get me wrong, there is slightly someone bigger in there who might actually be the “end boss”, but… that’s all? Come on now. <br />
So, the story. The beginning, pretty much the first half of the series is pretty good – easy to watch and really entertaining. The show is throughout great at not taking itself too seriously. Well - at first, because the second half is the total opposite of the first episodes. While still not being too serious about itself, Kaze no Stigma now feels like an old chunk of bread – chewy and unbearable. The comedy factor is pretty much dead while the drama is being forced out of literally nowhere. It feels like Kaze no Stigma is not working anymore in its own pace. The execution of the so-called plot twists is downright ridiculous, just like some strange and long passages which are completely meaningless – but we still get to see them.<br />
<br />
Art (6/10)<br />
The show is pretty old, I understand that. Yeah, so is the art in there. It’s doesn’t bother me too much at this point, I don’t need a show to be an artistic masterpiece. But still, while some effects are pretty good, the majority of the art we see looks pretty unattractive today.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10)<br />
There is not really much to say about the sound part. The opening and closing songs are fine, they fit the idea of Kaze no Stigma in a good way. Sadly I couldn’t find any memorable music in the show itself, the number of the songs is small, but at least it’s not getting annoying.<br />
<br />
Characters (5/10)<br />
Oh boy. That’s pretty much the weakest point of Kaze no Stigma. I have to agree, Kazuma might be a really good character. Might be, because the basic approach is fine, the later execution’s not. Kazuma starts off pretty damn cool, being a badass mage out of nowhere. As the show advances, he is getting completely soaked in into the mash of generic and poor characterization. But, oh well – there is the rest of the characters in there already! Seriously, we can completely forget about the character cast – they‘re all highly generic and replaceable, not a single one of them is somewhere near unique. Character development? Little to zero. I don’t intend to make it look bad, but what we get here is not much. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and final rating (6/10)<br />
Kaze no Stigma is not great. There are weaknesses all over the place and it could’ve been much, MUCH better.  BUT – it’s not that bad at all. So, let me leave a little advice here: don’t take this show too seriously and you might find your peace in it. Or just a little piece of enjoyment.<br />

    Kaze no stigma is a decent anime but it&#039;s hard for me to say that it was an excellent or even great anime. The only reason I could think for telling someone to watch it would be if you were really bored and had nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Despite ending the series leaving a lot of questions unanswered I just personally couldn&#039;t get myself to care that much. It&#039;s very predictable but I feel that way about the majority of the anime that I watch so if that sorta thing doesn&#039;t bug you, you&#039;ll enjoy this. On the other hand I felt like the cousin dating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165239">
        was really unnecessary. ignoring that their related, trowing in romance doesn&#039;t make you story any better and to me it sorta felt lazy. almost like a what should we do, well I guess we&#039;ll make them date situation.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I felt like the art work was decent, nothing really all that wrong with it. I personally wish there were less panty shots mainly just because of the timing (I want to see character fight when they fight not their underwear). Despite the panty shots this anime isn&#039;t any worst than really anything else out there (Fairly decent I&#039;d say) so don&#039;t let that keep you from watching it.<br />
<br />
Sound: It wasn&#039;t anything memorable but your ears will be safe.<br />
<br />
Characters: No one was original. all the typical stereotypes you tend to find and for most people that shouldn&#039;t really upset you. I found it very hard to care about them personally but very few anime get me to care about the whole cast even with very original characters so I believe the majority of you will feel different.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I did enjoy the anime, there&#039;s nothing special about it but it&#039;s short enough that I didn&#039;t really mind. I like shorter animes, you may feel differently but I&#039;ve noticed the longer something goes on the more filler there will be and quite frankly I hate filler with all my heart. This show does not have pointless episode after pointless episode and that&#039;s normally enough for me at lest.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I&#039;ll give it a seven. I feel like most people who would watch this anime on their own will enjoy it and that is good enough really. It is not the best but it&#039;s not bad. On the other hand if you hate story&#039;s with unanswered questions and incomplete endings  you should probably stay away. I didn&#039;t realize the anime was incomplete and was going to stay that way or I probably wouldn&#039;t have watched it. Normally I&#039;d avoid such a thing but the lack of an engaging plot made me realize I only care about the ending if I care about the story.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say there is no need to go out of the way to watch this anime but there is also no reason for most people to avoid it.

    Kaze no stigma is an Action/fantasy anime that got some of my attention, but it has some flaws. <br />
<br />
Story (7.2) - Not amazing. Its just an average story. In my opinion lacks originality, as this story is very cliche. It has some fillers, some episodes with no sense at all that appear out of nowhere and where nothing important really happens. In the final episodes, it gets a little better in this aspect, but still story is not an aspect that got my attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (8.4) - The characters are well designed, and the effects are pretty good. You can see it when the characters use

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7650">
        their powers, the flames and wind, and other powers, its really nice. Not the very best art from all times, but still is a nice aspect this anime has to give. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (7.0) - Another not so impressing aspect. The sound sure give some atmosphere and isnt anoying, but its definitively nothing great. Just and average in my opinion. Enough to keep some interest in this anime.<br />
<br />
Character (8.9)- I liked this aspect. Well develloped characters and looking cool.<br />
The main character, Yagami Kazuma is definetively very good, it gave an extra interest to this anime. Another aspect i liked was the variety of characters this anime have, where you clearly see many differences between them, and their relations with each other, that keeps the show interesting during some moments where the story lacks.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8.0) - A fine anime, not the best, but a good one to watch and pass some time. It has a lot of action in some moments, also we you can find romance and comedy in this anime. A nice way to spend time, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
overall (8) - For a tittle that didnt said much to me at start, it was really a nice surprise. Ok, its not fantastic, but surely is a good anime and if you like magic and battles stuff, then you should give it a try.<br />
<br />

    Alrighty, here it goes, my second review:<br />
<br />
*Story* 8/10<br />
The story for Kaze no Stigma (KnS) in my opinion was going to be stereotypical: cool awesome guy, possible love interest girl, his brother, a vengeance type plot relating to his family, etc etc... save the world and the anime gets 5/10... however after watching the anime can i say wow... sure it had some plot holes, for example the Stigma of the Wind is never really explained, and Kazuma&#039;s past seems rushed, however this does not really matter, because the story has enough twists and turns to keep you watching, and of course the usual love/romantic side

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14542">
        story between characters always adds a comedic side, overall i found that although it was a bit stereotypical, i thoroughly enjoyed this solid anime.<br />
<br />
*Art* 7/10<br />
Artwork in KnS was solid throughout the anime, wind was a major highlight of this anime, and the way the effects were done for the wind was a highlight, nothing really defied the laws of physics, and the wind seemed realistic. The main problem i had was with the fire artwork, to me it seemed as though the creators got lazy with fire and decided to just re-use the same boring fire image all over again, a bit a variance and realism would have been nice. However what really uplifts this anime is the character artwork, Kazuma looked cool, Ayano looked great, and ren looked loli-shota =P In my opinion the character artwork was above average for a 2007 anime.<br />
<br />
*Sound* 7/10<br />
The special effects sound was ok, i felt that something was missing in the fight scenes however, the anime needed more of a boom factor, and at times it seemed as if was lacking in BGM as well as the needed sword clashing sfx. The seiyuu&#039;s in this anime were fair, nothing outstanding, however well done to the Fujimura Ayumi, her voice acting for Ayano was one of the great things in this anime.<br />
<br />
*Character* 8/10<br />
The characters are the highlight of this anime, although it may seem  stereotypical, it is their construction that really outshines anything else. Kazuma&#039;s dark past really gives his character a Light Yagami sort of feel and i thoroughly enjoyed it, Ayano and Ren were great to, Ayano was a great tsundere/moe type character and the Ren side story really moved me close to tears, it reminded me of the FSN ending ;(.<br />
<br />
*Enjoyment* 8/10<br />
Need more be said? The characters pulled this anime through, and even though the sound wasn&#039;t anything new and the story wasn&#039;t all that amazing, i stil thoroughly enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
*OP and ED* 8/10<br />
The OP was constant for all 24 episodes, and it was a bit bland at times, but not to the extent that i had to skip it. The ED&#039;s on the other hand were on opposite ends of the scale, the first ed Hitorikiri no Sora was in my opinion dull and boring instead of reflective, the second ed Ayumi Fujimura Matataki no Kiwoku was far better, and in my opinion a great ED to remember. However one song struck me, and that was Kanako Sakai Tsuki Hana no Inori, the ED for episode 12 and also an insert song... that one song has made my list of most memorable reflective songs after a significant event rivaling songs such as Hikari by Jyukai.<br />
<br />
*Overall* 7/10<br />
A nice solid anime, not a must see, but one you should definitely take a glance at. The ending is very enjoyable, and it is worth the watch, the climax in the middle of the anime is fantastic, and like i said before the characters are great.<br />
<br />

    I found this anime when I&#039;m looking for an anime that have a bit romance and action, at the first I&#039;m a bit bored because of the picture quality, but then I getting interested because the story is good enough for me, and to be honest I really like how the Hero react to Heroine.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a bit sinopsis of it: Yagami Kazuma who&#039;s get away from his clan because his father think he&#039;s a disgrace to the family (because his clan &quot;Kannagi&quot; was originaly a fire affinity users), he going overseas and become the wind affinity user, and after four years he returned to Japan,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170083">
        but he was accused as the perpetrator of a series of murdered Kannagi Family.<br />
Even he was accused, he still don&#039;t really has an intension to prove it wrong, but after talk to the Head of Kannagi, he decide to do it, and he&#039;ll be acompanied by the Head of Kannagi daughter, Kannagi Ayano.  they end up oftenly doing battle side by side.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it, Like always, I&#039;m not gonna spoil all the story, you&#039;ve to watch the completed episode and enjoy it by yourself.<br />
<br />
But, you&#039;ll found a bit romance in this anime, and some action battle too. So, what are you waiting for, watch it after you seen this reviews, okay?<br />
<br />
See ya

    i dont understand why everyone is giving it bad ratings! i really enjoyed it, kaze no stigma had it all, action, comedy, romance, cliches and yes, fillers. but there is no such anime without cliches and fillers...but i personnally loved it and would like to re-watch it. the art is good (with extreme colors like blue and flaming red hair) the sound is good too, the wind and fire, the voice actors really did a good job and the director chose the right people to do the right job. the only negative point i can see in it is that there could hae been a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19095">
        bit more romance and the end was a clif-hanger...but i highly recomand it to the people who like both shounen and shoujo at the same time, those who are crazy about fighting and thirsty for blood, this isnt the right anime for you, go watch bleach or something! its not for pure shoujo lovers eather, this isnt a lovy-gouvy-duvy anime, go watch kimi no todoke or something. oh, and the yuri/yaoi fans,i think you should go to another field of search...

    When I read the summary of this anime and saw the characters, I thought it was going to be a ripoff of Shakugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima, two excellent anime in their own right. Well.... to be truthful, this is a lot like both of those anime. And to be frank, the red-haired tsundere in this anime (Ayano) doesn&#039;t measure up to the leads in the others. She&#039;s not nearly as badass as Shana and not nearly as adorable or lovable as Louise. However, it&#039;s Kazuma, the other lead, that really makes this show fly. It&#039;s really refreshing to watch a show where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7947">
        the main lead is a total freaking badass and the conflict is not him trying to become more powerful, but rather struggling with his control of it. There are so many cliches his character could have fallen into but it never happened. The first test was when he faced his dad in battle a few episodes in. The cliche would have been for him to lose only to beat him later. NOPE! Kazuma took that old guy out! I won&#039;t spoil anything more (although it&#039;s hardly a spoiler. Their battle lasted like a minute.) but Kazuma is the reason to watch and really enjoy this show and he never disappoints. The ending was garbage as far as the romance goes (a warning for you out there looking for magic-girl romance), but the rest of it was satisfying and there&#039;s good reason to hope for Season 2.<br />
<br />
Solid anime. I would recommend it to anyone.

    Storyline: 8/10<br />
Few filler Episodes such as the Amusement Park and the Hot Spring, but nothing really to ruin the flow of the Series. The first half of the series are just assignments and later on in the series is where most of the major plot elements begin. However, I would have liked It If they have gotten deeper into Kazuma&#039;s past because It seems like they don&#039;t explain as much. Overall, the story of Kaze No Stigma kept It interesting till&#039; the end.<br />
<br />
Art: 7.5/10<br />
I&#039;m overall impressed with the Artwork for a 2007 Anime, but the animations and/or effects could have been better. Mainly, where Ayano

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80200">
        uses her fire magic and It seems like the creators just kept re-using those scenes  rather than changing It up a bit.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.7/10<br />
Music is impressive, effects are decent. For this portion of the Review, I would like to say that I watched the dub version than the raw version. In any case If you wish to watch the dub and thinking whether or not the English Voices are done well, I will talk about It here. Now, I am impressed on how well this anime was dubbed. My favorite one would be Kazuma&#039;s voice actor because of his ignorant and jerky attitude really suits him quite well. Ayano&#039;s voice actor is high pitched, It can be an annoyance sometimes, but that&#039;s pretty much Ayano&#039;s personality for the most part, so I can&#039;t really say much about the pitch of her voice. Ren&#039;s voice actor is also decent. It suits him pretty well, I can&#039;t complain anything about that. Just overall, the Dub isn&#039;t that bad.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Gotta say, I love the characters introduced in this series. My favorite would be Kazuma. I just love his personality. He is funny at times and of course his jerky attitude. Ayano is also another interesting character to point out as well as Ren.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9.5/10<br />
Considering this is my first time entering a new genre of Supernatural or &quot;magic&quot; animes, I gotta say that I enjoyed Kaze no Stigma. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9.0/10<br />
Overall, Kaze no Stigma is one interesting anime. It has a mixed of Comedy, Action, and depressing moments. Pacing is decent, not too fast, not too slow, just in the middle. But If your the type of person who decides to look into more anime that have superpowers, Kaze no Stigma won&#039;t be a disappointment.
