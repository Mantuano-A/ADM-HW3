    It&#039;s an immensely enjoyable ride with this series. It&#039;s a relatively simple story, but it&#039;s easy to follow and it&#039;s a fun watch. The series composition is amazing in that I always feel satisfied after watching because most times it contains drama within the episode and also balances it out with lighthearted moments. It never gets too heavy even while you are emotionally moved by plot developments.<br />
<br />
I first decided to try out this series because I saw a composer that I like was doing the soundtrack. Honestly this show wouldn&#039;t have attracted me otherwise since I like watching anime with action or romance, so I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206296">
        didn&#039;t expect I would come to love this series. <br />
<br />
The first episode will definitely catch viewers off guard. But even though you&#039;ll often be surprised by the sudden songs it&#039;s something you&#039;ll find yourself more or less getting used to. I recommend watching at least the first 3 episodes to see how you&#039;ll like it. <br />
<br />
Starmyu appears to be this dumb silly show but if you go deeper you&#039;ll see the writers and director have put quite a bit of thought into it. There&#039;s symbolism here and there and I like how they lay down plotlines and details that are picked up later again in the show. And more than that, it&#039;s a classic story about youth and friendship, dealing with their own everyday troubles, chasing their dreams. I love the tagline on the show&#039;s promotional materials - &quot;I don&#039;t know a way to give up my dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
A big plus of Starmyu for me is that it takes away annoyances I&#039;ve had with other anime. There&#039;s always the energetic and optimistic character type which appears here in form of Hoshitani, but the good thing about him is that he&#039;s surprisingly realistic when it counts. Also, the lack of a female MC in this show (it being an all-boys school) was especially refreshing, and it made the relationship between the guys shine even more instead of watching them vie over a girl.<br />
<br />
If I had to name one fault that Starmyu had, it would probably be the animation, which sometimes looks derpy and low-budget. There were a couple of times where the characters didn&#039;t look themselves. But in return for that the staff puts special attention on the musical scenes. Some of them are really pretty and detailed, and the dance scene in one of the episodes was quite talked about thanks to the smooth hand-drawn animation.<br />
<br />
No grouches about the voice acting. There are some good choices here in the cast since there is a lot of singing going on and for the most part they have good vocals, including even the least experienced member of the cast Lounsbery Arthur, who&#039;s playing a main character for the first time. Standout singing voices for me are KENN and Hanae Natsuki. <br />
<br />
I think that the music is something that everyone can listen to. Personally the character songs are 50-50 hit and miss for me, but that&#039;s a very high rate by my standards. The good songs are really good, while the rest are just &quot;meh&quot; but not dislikable. Soundtrack BGM-wise, it&#039;s always excellent in this series.<br />
<br />
Lastly while this series is obviously targeted at females, I&#039;ve noticed that there is quite a handful of guys in Japan who enjoy it. Don&#039;t be put off by the all-male cast; you might just enjoy the story.

    Story: 5/10<br />
Generic. The story involves 5 boys who have auditioned and been put into an idol group within their school and must compete to be placed into the music department. This means they’ll be evaluated on their performance growth to see whether they could make it in the schools official elite musical. <br />
Generally, you would assume this would mean competing against the other groups of performers for a place in the department. While this is true, it’s only to an extent. Ive counted over 20 different groups, and we only saw one group besides our main group ever perform, which they only did twice. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207356">
        means there is almost ZERO tension when they are ranked as we dont see what any of the other teams did to compare them too! We dont even get to see much of the technical side of rehearsing, as we mostly receive still shots of stretches or poses. Whatever.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Going back and listening to the tracks, they actually werent bad. I think my favorite voices belong to Kaito and Kakkeru. Voice acting was pretty solid but I cant really recall much background music.<br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10<br />
<br />
Generic Tropes. We have the stoic, blue haired “perfect” boy with an Onii-san complex, Red-haired and arrogant uppity boy, a timid motherly type who just wants peace, The purple other-stoic but also edgy artsy one (he plays piano!), and the BORING upbeat brown-haired protagonist. Red-har was the most entertaining, as I appreciate the arrogant ones a lot plus, his cat stuff was cute.<br />
However, the character interactions just dont feel right. After watching it, the kids barely know shit about each other and I really barely feel any substance tying each other together aside from being on team Otori. I suppose Nayuki became more outgoing from being on the team and being around MC-kun, but it want really focused on. The characters barely reflect on their past or talk about their feelings so I really dont understand why I should care.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 3/10<br />
<br />
Art: TERRIBLE. The character designs are so uncomfortable to look at. Almost every frame had me cringing just at the faces. Seriously, what were they thinking. It’s easy to see almost all the faces are identical to wear I feel like im watching the much-better Osomatsu-san. Everyone’s haor had this weird splotch of (root?) color at the top making it look like they all had bad dye jobs. Even the bodies have mostly the same shape. This designer should be fired. Some of the backgrounds during the songs looked nice I guess.<br />
Animation: Ugh. Some of these episodes would have at least a third of the scenes shown in still frames. It’s almost like they didnt try. Theatre is a very visual and moving art, but it feels so stiff, just like most of their dance sequences. Also, please fire this animation director. Overlaying ugly still images over simple repetitive movements doesnt look nice, it makes it look like you got lazy.  There was also an extreme over use of sparkles. Come on.<br />
<br />
At least I got some good laughs at the over the top performances. Nayuki rode on a dolphin through the sky. That’s good shit.

    Ludonarrative dissonance is a pretentious term from 2006 game reviewers that refers to a game&#039;s narrative clashing with its gameplay. Having watched &quot;Starmyu&quot;, formerly referred to as &quot;High School Star Musical&quot;, I believe that this term should be co-opted for things outside of video games, such as animation.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a certain point in the final episode where the titular Stardust Team claims that they will host their final performance in an avant-garde way. You see, that&#039;s sort of the overarching story of this show. The musical team of our 5 main characters likes to perform in unconventional ways - challenging the standards of their school ensnared

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206807">
        with tradition. So while this embracing of the new and unconventional ways totally makes sense within the show&#039;s story, it clashes with the anime as a whole.<br />
<br />
I have not watched Prince-Sama, but I have been told by multiple trusted sources that High School Star Musical&#039;s format is a carbon-copy of it. And judging by descriptions alone that makes total sense. Both feature musical academies with teams of 5 bishonen boys color-coded by their hair, and are likely made to appeal to the exact same audience. While High School Star Musical&#039;s moral seems to be embracing quirky and new ideas, its execution is the exact opposite. It plays itself so safely that there&#039;s not a single moment of the show that stands out to me. Likewise, there&#039;s not a single moment that I really hated. High School Star Musical carefully constrains itself into as many classic tropes it can find, and by doing so, makes itself a bastion of average. <br />
<br />
Although I didn&#039;t hate any of it, High School Star Musical definitely has some quirks. The character designs look like they were stolen from the vaults of the producers of Free!, and the character models seem are very samey. Episode 6 introduces two twin girl characters (the only girls in the whole show, literally), and they kind of look like the animators just took their standard boy designs and added some long pink hair. Also they reminded me of those twin girls from Johnny Test. God bless all of our souls.<br />
<br />
High School Star Musical, like almost every bishonen show, suffers badly from queerbaiting. The target audience of this show was surely preteen and teenage girls, and to capitalize on that, the producers made sure to add plenty of romantic tension between the main characters. But never enough. You see, the producers want those teenage girls to take the cast of High School Star Musical as their husbandos. However, they also know that boy&#039;s love sells. In an attempt to appease both, the producers add all sorts of blushes, stuttering, and even misinterpreted declarations of love and dates, but never actually announce that their male characters are in gay relationships. This queerbaiting is present in western shows too (think Supernatural and Sherlock), and once you notice it, it&#039;s really hard to ignore that the producers are using marginalized sexual orientations as a footstool to make their show more popular, without even giving those orientations proper representation. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been giving High School Star Musical a lot of flak, but if its goal was to create an utterly average show like I outlined earlier, then it did it well. If you don&#039;t put a lot of critical thinking into it, the show isn&#039;t a slog to get through - under one condition. If you watch the show at 1.5 times speed, it becomes easy to get through and all the music goes nightcore mode. The lines are simplistic enough that you can keep up with reading too. Shortening episode duration to 15 minutes makes this show incredibly manageable, and if I hadn&#039;t discovered this I would probably have given it a lower rating.<br />
<br />
In the end, High School Star Musical seems as average as can be, but there may be a lot of value in the discourse that results from it. Its ludonarrative dissonance is strongly resonating and each viewer may interpret said dissonance very differently.<br />
<br />

_____________<br />
Back in 2006, when the term &quot;ludonarrative dissonance&quot; was coined, game reviewers were so caught up in talking about how a game&#039;s mechanics worked alongside its story that they forgot to actually talk about things readers cared about, like whether the game was fun and worth buying. Sort of like how you can read a Pitchfork album review and have no idea what the music is supposed to sound like. So for the Starmyu Review, I tried to recreate that feeling of being so far up your own ass that you can&#039;t even write good reviews.

    This series is by no means an amazing masterpiece that will blow your socks off into another dimension. At the same time I think this anime has some good qualities that make it worth the watch.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
It&#039;s a singing anime so there are a ton of songs in this series. Although some songs aren&#039;t all that great, some are pretty enjoyable. Sadly, these songs actually added to my enjoyment of the series in a rather shameful way. Most of the transitions between singing and real live is so ridiculous, its comical. The transitions just fail terrible, making it pretty hilarious. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 6<br />
I&#039;ve seen better and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206175">
        I&#039;ve seen worse. It really isn&#039;t special or spectacular in anyway. I do like however that the characters dancing is drawn instead of done with CGI. It adds more life to the characters. The character designs are also decently unique and it is easy to tell all of them apart. <br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
I&#039;m not even going to try to make this sound better than it is. The story is pretty cliche, but still stands on its own in some peculiar way. Although the events are somewhat predictable, they don&#039;t come out of nowhere. Foreshadowing is actually present in the series, which seems to be some foreign concept in anime nowadays. That being said, the series has no innovative storyline. It isn&#039;t a bad typical story, but it is quite typical.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
The shining star of the anime would have to be its characters. They are a pretty fun cast and everyone grows on you. I have to commend this series for paying attention to character development. Yes their development is subtle, but it is very logical and smooth. What I am really trying to say here is that the character development does not come out of nowhere. I like how the series is built on relationships between characters, and doesn&#039;t try to be so typical in that area. Especially as the series comes to a close it is easy to see that Starmyu has taken plenty of time to make each main character pretty special. Also, shoutout to Kuga (quiet guy) for being the best mom!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
This would have to be one of the guilty pleasure animes that I have seen. I acknowledge how cliche and stupid so many of the moments are, but at the same time I had a pretty fun time watching this. Sometimes the sheer stupidity of the series had my laughing out loud. If you don&#039;t want to watch a tragedy, this is the way to go. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this series to people who generally like this kind of series: almost all male cast, a little bit dramatic, lots of ships, ridiculous events, cute characters, and lots of singing.

    the only enjoyable thing about this show was making fun of it. my friend and i literally came up with a new backstory for the main character because he was so painfully boring and bland. he was like an unseasoned chicken breast-- he was that bad. he wasn&#039;t talented!! he sucked!! there was nothing about his character that i liked. he&#039;s probably the worst main character i&#039;ve ever seen in an anime.<br />
the four others in the main group were fine. they were really only defined by one or two things/traits, but they were better than the main character, who i hate with a fiery passion.<br />

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256111">
        only people i cared about in this series was the rival group. if THEY were the stars i would have loved this show. they were ten times more interesting than the main group, i screamed every time they came on screen, and they were just the better group. i was hoping and praying for their final performance, AND I DIDNT EVEN GET TO SEE THAT. WHAT THE HELL.<br />
the music wasnt that bad, but i didn&#039;t care about the story. at first the art caught my eye, but as it went on the amount of boring shots in each episode really killed it for me.<br />
so yeah i don&#039;t like this show. i might watch season two just to mercilessly mock it and scream at the dumbass main character, but i doubt it. looking back on it, the show was just pretty boring to me.

    I am a quite big fan of music anime and handsome anime guys so it&#039;s a given that I would like this anime.But I don&#039;t think you would regret watching this even if only to laugh at the boys&#039; weird dances(and songs) that pop out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Story(7/10)<br />
<br />
At first I didn&#039;t know what I was getting myself into,I just knew there would be music so that was enough for me.The story isn&#039;t all that new and was fairly predictable but it still was entertaining.<br />
The main character,Hoshitani once saw a boy dancing when he was in middle school and it captivated the protagonist so much that he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222942">
        even enrolled at Aoyanagi academy to become an amazing entertainer.He didn&#039;t really know much else besides the fact that he could achieve his dream there so when Nayuki tells him about the competition for the star frame class,he enters without realising that it isn&#039;t all that easy.But then his performance catches Ootori&#039;s eye so he takes Hoshitani under his wing along with 4 other students who were supposed to fail.From then on they proceed to follow their senpai&#039;s lead and actually having fun with what they do unlike the other members who follow the rules to maintain the school&#039;s tradition and reputation.There are a few obstacles and thorns along the way of our heroes but there isn&#039;t anything our heroes can&#039;t overcome with the power of music.<br />
The story is simple enough,the pacing felt a bit slow at times(but they actually rehearse!) and halfway through is just getting to know the characters but it&#039;s a nice change to sit back and relax,enjoy the music and laugh.<br />
<br />
Art(7/10)<br />
<br />
Most animes of this genre us a more mature look for the characters that would give a more appealing look but this one used a more cartoonish style.Three of the main guys have unbelievably big eyes(Nayuki looks like a bunny with that pout of his) but the rest look alright.Their rivals seemed better looking in my eyes to be honest.And most of them were &#039;&#039;assigned&#039;&#039; a color to make the differences visible.For example Hoshitani green,Tengenji red,Nayuki yellow ,Tsukigami blue,Kuga purple,etc.It&#039;s a given with the number of characters I guess.I am at least glad that this anime doesn&#039;t use CGI for the dances,that would&#039;ve been horrible.<br />
<br />
Sound(7/10)<br />
<br />
The songs aren&#039;t all that wow but they are acceptable.Not too memorable either but I enjoyed the opening and ending,Kuga and Tsukigami&#039;s character songs and their first performance.It&#039;s also a plus that Ootori has the voice of Grimmjow(Bleach),Aomine(Knb),Ren(Utapri) and Atobe(Pot).Every time he says &#039;&#039;boys&#039;&#039; is a blessing to my ears.<br />
<br />
Characters(7/10)<br />
<br />
The characters follow quite a bit on single trait basis at first:Hoshitani is the one who can get along with everyone,Nayuki shy,Tengenji tsundere,Kuga quiet,Tsukigami the brocon and Ootori the model.Even if there wasn&#039;t that critical of a development in the boys,it still was pleasing to see beyond their stereotypical appeareances,relate to the characters and cheer them on.I&#039;m a bit surprised at the relationship between the student president and Ootori but I feel it was a nice addition.The president&#039;s fanboy annoyed me like hell though.Did he really have to butt in every time.At least in the end he gives the boys a break...<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(7/10)<br />
<br />
This has been a nice experience for me because I managed to forget my worries when I was watching those students achieve their dreams.It isn&#039;t the most memorable of animes and you won&#039;t have a change of life perspectives because of it but it&#039;s entertaining.I would rewatch it again just because.<br />
<br />
Overall(7/10)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an average musical anime with all the clichest of premises but I felt it was something more than that and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to unwind and enjoy its liveliness.<br />
<br />

    I like this story line very much and this anime has been one of my favorites. I like the story line cause it talks about 5 boys who all audition in their school. I like how they develop their trust in each other and get along and have a friendship that they would cherish until their third year. I like how they got through all the problems they had and overcame their problem together. I like their development in each character creating new friendships with others and trusting and knowing in their selves they could do it together. This is just my opinion so you

        dont have to agree with me if you dont like it I can respect that. I would recommend this to people who like to see idol boy groups (mostly girls cause this is focused to be on the girls liking) and who people who would also like musicals because they sing alot in other parts.

    Starmyu - An enjoyable and funny, yet slightly cringey and weird show.<br />
<br />
After watching the TV series imagine-nation, you can learn a few things about the show and art.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
It&#039;s a weird show, but it&#039;s quite funny. It&#039;s a bit predictable, but still entertaining enough to keep you engaged till the end. You&#039;d like to see what happens to the characters as they story continues, and the complication comes along. There isn&#039;t much to describe here, but even so, I think the storyyline is good.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Please don&#039;t get me started on the art. I&#039;m sorry, but seriously. The main characters&#039; appearances look alright, but honestly, most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246274">
        of the characters look really..really...REALLY....I dunno...weird? Sorry if you think they look handsome or anything, I just find them weird. I mean, have you seen Kaito&#039;s older brother Haruto? I&#039;m sorry to his fans out there but..CRINGE. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say here as well but the songs were really great and nice to listen to and the voice actors played their part not amazingly well. I especially loved the song they performed in Episode 12 . The voice actors of Team Otori are quite famous actually.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
The characters were okay I guess. They&#039;re a bit cliche. The leader, the upbeat Yuta Hoshitani, his best friend(well, at least, I&#039;m pretty sure he is) the gentleToru Nayuki, the strict blue-haired Kaito Tsukigami, the arrogant Kakeru Tengenji, and the quiet Shuu Kuga. Is it just be or are they similar to the Love Live! characters?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Overall, it was alright and I think it was quite funny. The songs were great, the story was nice, characters were fine and so was the art. I recommend you watch this anime if you like anime boys trying to become musical stars. The 2nd Season is actually quite good so far, so I hope you watch that too^^

    Enter the next coming of UtaPri! Or what it was suppose to be, I think. This one is just another in the singing anime trend that&#039;s been going on. Well, with the rise in popularity of the voice actors, I&#039;m not very surprised.<br />
<br />
StarMyu is a bit different from UtaPri since there is zero romance (and lots and lots of bromance). Kind of to the point where I think it borders the shounen ai genre, but I like to think of it as guys who are extremely close friends. Yes. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The story itself is pretty cliche. It follows that group of failures/ oddballs that are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206325">
        picked up by oddball yet talented senpai and turned into sparkling talents themselves through hardwork and conflict. Pretty standard for animes regarding the entertainment industry. Standard set. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The anime is really pretty to look at as well. The character designs aren&#039;t too flashy, but give off the &quot;I am the main character&quot; vibe and it&#039;s great. The dance sequences are also animated really well, although I wish they could change the dance choreography a bit, but that&#039;s just personal taste. It&#039;s a really pretty and beautifully done anime in terms of the animation department! 9/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The cast of the anime sing really well. I can&#039;t give it a lower score. They&#039;ve got some sweet songs in the anime, but not nearly as good as UtaPri. They used singing voice actors, including Ono Kensho, who&#039;s actually a singer. This was one of the first singing animes I&#039;ve heard with Hanae Natsuki in the cast, but from the character songs I&#039;ve heard, he&#039;s a pretty decent singer as well. Nice songs to listen to and the lyrics aren&#039;t strange to listen to outside of context! Although listening to some duets between the guys was difficult to take seriously because the lyrics were clearly love lyrics, but it was because of some bromance conflict thing.<br />
<br />
Characters: 6/10<br />
The cast is also pretty standard set. You&#039;ve got the optimistic try-hard who starts off as the hole of the team and can&#039;t do anything from lack of experience. Then you have the shy boi who&#039;s good at cooking and cleaning, the mama of the group of boyz. Then you have the arrogant one that calls everyone a boor because he&#039;s got a ton of kabuki talent and comes from a renown family. Then the aniue complex boi who has his stuff together but always feels overshadowed by his bro-bro. And you can&#039;t forget the aloof one who&#039;s strange and didn&#039;t really have much character development because he just sort of got along with everyone without an episode dedicated to him. I mean, they show why he&#039;s so mature and stuff, but in the end he just kind of joins with no conflict. Pretty standard boy bandy stuff.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
The dance scenes were pretty enjoyable to watch, although they just kind of broke out into song in the most random places and I couldn&#039;t help but make to fun of it. Like I said, it was really pretty to look at and the characters may be standard but their pretty balanced so their interactions are pretty entertaining to follow as well. Story&#039;s not really memorable though.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
If they had come up with a better scriptwriter, I think the anime would&#039;ve been a lot better than it was. The overall plot was just cliche and bad. The animation and sound made me watch the anime through the end and definitely made me enjoy it. If you want singing, pretty boys, and great animation, StarMyu is where it&#039;s at.<br />

    It is the japanese version of High School Star Musical<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
This anime is so enjoyable with simplistic story and conflict. There&#039;s episodes that focuses on each characters with their solo performance. Every episode fleshes out the development for each character but they never truly change.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is very common and sometimes it gives out a cool scene but I can&#039;t help but look at some deformed character parts.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Every episode is full of numbers by each of the characters ala High School Musical and even though there&#039;s no unique beat and catchiness in it, I love how it gives the characters a personality.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The characters are common, you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206519">
        have the optimistic center, shy guy, boastful guy, overshadowed-by-his-famous-brother guy, and the side guy. Nevertheless, they all became enjoyable to watch. I laugh at how fast they got friendly with each other but hey, it is a 12 episode anime.<br />
<br />
The rivals though are lackluster, they&#039;re just a group of bishounen who just dance and I can&#039;t see how they&#039;re better, aura wise and all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the anime and not one minute did it made me bored. It is so funny and the cast are just so simple, no complicated backstory that can make head fuzzy. Just simple anime to watch and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Overall, I had fun with watching it but I don&#039;t know for you guys.

    Several other people say it&#039;s generic or poorly made. I honestly really enjoyed this show despite, sure, the plot is a little cliche but it&#039;s totally worth it. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of idol shows out there and this one is indeed like most of them, but I don&#039;t know of any other idol shows where the characters literally just randomly start singing. And that&#039;s one of my favorite parts. The songs are actually not that bad, albeit a bit random. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s the kind of show you need to give a chance. Watching only the first episode definitely won&#039;t say much on the show. To enjoy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325881">
        it, you really need to learn to appreciate the characters, or the main ones, since there is quite a few of them.  <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re planning on watching this, you should definitely check it out without giving up because of a few negative reviews. :3

    The songs were amazing! It&#039;s very enjoyable, good story line and overall i recommend it to people who like Utapri or Music. The singing was very good, The voice actors for Tsukigami and Kuga had good voiced when singing the Ootori Countdown!~ Overall i rate it a 10/10. The main points of this anime was probably friendship or working hard to achieve your dreams and goals. It focuses on alot of the Starmyu characters and talks about their past and why they decided to tryout for the star team. There&#039;s a lot of competition between team Ootori and team Hiragi, well, that makes it hilarious!

    When I first saw STARMYU introduced in 2015 I actually thought, &quot;oh? another boys idol anime, name is kind of lame and these characters look a bit generic.&quot; Because I usually don&#039;t enjoy idol animes as much, although I think they are great to watch just for fun. 2 years later, I found my initial thoughts completely wrong and enjoyed the series so much I watched it twice for the first time. <br />
<br />
A lot of people seem to compare this to UtaPri, which can be true at times but I think the overall tone of the anime is drastically different from how UtaPri presents itself.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241140">
        Such as UtaPri capitalizes on nuanced romance and STARMYU is more about pure romantic love for music and performance, also not &quot;idols&quot;.  <br />
<br />
STORY: 7<br />
Throughout the anime, the storyline is pretty straightforward, standard run of the mill: dreams, hard work, friendship, rivals, conflicts, etc. However, it presents itself in an interesting format of interjecting character songs/songs in general to serve as inner dialogue and characters motivations. This might be jarring (and I was also completely like wtf in the first episode), but it became entertaining once I understood its use (*gasp* like in a musical *says the stupid me*). And how could you go wrong with comedic song inserts? The dialogues actually spoken also are a refreshing, and well written take on many overdone concepts and themes: like really developing the characters and their conflicts. <br />
<br />
Sometimes the dialogue also gets extremely cliche cringe worthy, but the show accepts that and I give props to it for not presenting it through rose colored lenses. (Which I will point out in UtaPri because you know those are hella cringe worthy lines only made not cringe worthy by beautiful voices and glamour shots).<br />
<br />
ART: 8<br />
At times the art quality isn&#039;t that great, and character designs may seem very bland for its genre. Nonetheless, I think facial expressions are drawn very well when crucial and portray all the characters emotions no matter how subtle (ex: the character Kuga). Backgrounds are drawn in a way suited to the setting, but the character song bg&#039;s are fantastic and artistic! <br />
<br />
Also fantastic is the use of no CG and hand drawn performances! I&#039;m quite impressed with the routines in their shown fluidity and the actual choreography. I don&#039;t think any other series I&#039;ve seen holds up to par, because you can feel the weight of pull of every movement. If you also look you can even see that &quot;wrong&quot; parts are choreographed. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 10<br />
Being a musical anime, the music&#039;s going to make or break the anime for me. I think I enjoyed this series as well as it did because of the music. To start with the voice actors all are well suited to their roles. What&#039;s even more impressive is how well suited their voices are to each individual&#039;s song and how great they are able to adapt their singing to different musical impressions and genres. This anime presents a lot of musical genres and approaches that are all wonderfully done, the song writers did a beautiful job and took chances that played out well. I&#039;m surprised I loved every single song to the point of going to buy them for sure.<br />
<br />
The OST/background music is so effing beautiful. Its extremely notable at the points of conflict/tension and each piece is well suited for the type of conflict (ex: sad, frustration, resolve). These range from beautiful piano pieces that haunt throughout to even heart pumping techno ones. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 7<br />
The main cast fits into the archetypal boys: the cheerful one, the shy one, the silent guy, the oresama guy, and the I&#039;ve got reasons why I&#039;m like this arrogant guy - also enforced by their hair colors! But I think each one develops in a refreshing manner that&#039;s not over the top unrealistic or cheesy. Background/secondary characters are also entertaining to meet, perhaps more so than the main guys. The only thing really lacking is that the &quot;villainous&quot; characters motivations weren&#039;t portrayed well enough to convince me that they really needed to do some of the stuff they do. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
I watched this twice the first run through.. I&#039;m also going to buy all the songs I can. I absolutely love music anime because I&#039;ve dabbled in music myself. But I&#039;m often disappointed with the lack of well done music in many of these &quot;music&quot; animes. Usually because 1) nothing new is done 2) minimal effort in song production leading to very bland, not very complex arrangements. STARMYU is above a lot of music animes and makes me fall in love with music again. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8<br />
Personally I would rate at a 9 but I held back. I wrote this review because I&#039;m saddened by how many people pass this over because they clearly expected something else. I would recommend you watch this if you love/appreciate music, keep in mind this will take on a musical format, a little comedic ridiculousness, light hearted development, and cute boys as a plus.

    So this anime series proves that real life highschool musicals will be below anime versions in every way although it has its flaws its also a good series in many ways. <br />
<br />
I liked most of the story although its cheesy but thats what these kind of anime are. If there isnt cheesy lines or cheesy story it would be something different. Following your admired sempai per say is a good beginning and they do create a good story to build it up. I feel that the story flows very naturally although it has its stops to which i give the main character half the blame

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262502">
        although i will come to that later. This anime does well in not trying to drag its story out of put something  unnecessary that feels like fillers. And since this anime is a musical anime its no doubt that there will be a song in every episode so thats a pause that people just have to go with. <br />
<br />
All i can say about the animation is that its done in a way that its easy on the eye which many newer anime have as an advantage. <br />
<br />
One thing i have learned as i have went through alot of music anime is that there will always be bad with some good songs and this anime isnt an exception. The good songs and decent ones has a certain impact to them but some songs gets too drawn and plainly boring imo. The opening and ending is forgettable and you will easily be able to skip them. On the other hand its great that there is so much music to dig into since atleast there will probably be one song for anyone who enjoys these song types of anime and we will all have our opinions on whats the best and worst. <br />
<br />
My bias opinions will show through as i tell anyone who reads this review about characters in this anime specially the main character. This is not a fight anime there i can say he loses battles too easily. No this is simply dude doesnt know a thing and gets helped in every sence of the way and his only positive quality is that he is positive human being thats all. Sometimes you feel that the story gets its cracks because this dude never moves forward in a good way. Since mostly he just smashes his way through hoping everything will work out. The main character is someone you sometimes want to strangle and sometimes root for although in my case the first thing is more likely as i watch it. Luckily other characters that surrounds him helps lifting that impression alot higher and due to  this anime moving at a decent phase you dont feel an intent to murder the main guy. <br />
<br />
Despite my bias opinion on the main character i still found alot  of enjoyment from this anime that came from some good songs and characters in it. <br />
<br />
Overall this anime isnt outstanding in every sence of the word but its not a boring anime either. Its a good and nice anime that i recommend to anyone who wants a new change of phase when it comes to maybe a new genre. Or maybe they want a different type of music anime that has a different feel to most music anime out there.

    This anime is one of the rare few about musicals so it is indeed a good one especially if you are in search for inspiring and refreshing songs. Each character has a song of their own which really (indeed) reflect who they are. The songs are one good thing, so is the characters. One will surely enjoy the different personalities of each characters and how they jive with each other. The &#039;acts&#039; towards the &#039;dreams&#039; express themes of &#039;friendship&#039;. Regarding the art, it is a clean one from its&#039; batch. The story revolving on something we can relate to is a &#039;hit&#039;.  In entirety,

    After watching all twelve episodes, I find Starmyu highly overrated at its current average score of 7.09. The story and the setting being clichés I wouldn&#039;t mind, after all what can one expect from high school slice of life? Even if it is flavoured and we have a music academy instead of a regular school this time - that&#039;s really where its specialty starts and ends.<br />
<br />
From the very start I&#039;ve had the feeling that the anime suffers from a bit of an identity crisis: the main cast is supposed to be a bunch of musical students, but pretty much all we ever see them do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250249">
        is practice dance moves and sing. Last I checked, musicals are not operas, they include acting as well, something there&#039;s about one and a half attempts at bringing into the show. It&#039;s more of idols in training, and that in itself wouldn&#039;t be bad if it wasn&#039;t for the constant verbal reminders that they in fact want to be &quot;musical stars&quot;. The singing itself, however, is a problem, as I don&#039;t think I can recall one single song that was entirely cringe-free in 12 episodes. Which is saying a lot as there is at least one &quot;performance&quot; in every episode: again, in the genre, one can&#039;t really expect much from the lyrics, but here the prompts (if there is one) and the &quot;performances&quot; themselves are both just cringe-worthy. And somehow out of place, weird, random: from all we see it&#039;s like it&#039;s in their heads, as opposed to within the scene with the other character(s) there with them; just diving into memories or musings, magically changed into some costume, in an imaginary world (much like an opening or ending) - but then the song ends and the interactions with whoever&#039;s there in the scene seem to prove that yes, that singing really did happen. On that note let&#039;s not forget that one song does not make a musical, either: practical limitations obviously prevent anything more full-fledged, but it&#039;s unfortunate that I can&#039;t recall even a single remark or hint or anything else about this &quot;tiny&quot; detail (save for the words &quot;musical&quot; and &quot;actor&quot; being constantly thrown around, which rather annoys than helps, all things considered).<br />
<br />
But who even are &quot;they&quot;, the main cast? As far as I&#039;m concerned, it&#039;s five rather common boys, with the protagonist being the most unremarkable one of them all. They each have about one trope characteristic, and one &quot;fatal&quot; flaw that immediately nullifies their chance to get on a Star Team and that is all - the four of them also magically form a bond with the &quot;leader&quot; after just one personal incident. I don&#039;t think I could even call them bishounen: on one hand there really isn&#039;t a &quot;control group&quot; they could stand out from; on the other, I don&#039;t find them particularly pretty either. Not entirely unlikeable, but there&#039;s very little to like them for. And their superiors, the esteemed Kaou-kai? Two of them get quite the focus, while the other three barely get enough screen time for us to even remember their names.<br />
<br />
Once more, all these wouldn&#039;t make such a bad overall impression, if only... <br />
If only there was something to the story at least. One little twist, one moment of actual clarity and realisation, one instance of real comedy. Anything.<br />
If only at least some of the characters were actually pretty or had a hint of depth to them. An actual overdone trait, a bit of actual drama that&#039;s not obvious at first glance, some confusion, some real issue. Anything. As it is, I found it hard to connect to them, and I&#039;m not sure they really connected with each other.<br />
If only at least the animation was farther away from average and a little closer to great, at least in the crucial performance scenes. Sadly, even those are quite often downright shoddy, with annoyingly choppy dance moves that really shouldn&#039;t exist here.<br />
If only at least the songs were memorable: catchy tunes, great melody, nice rhythm, creative lyrics. Instead they&#039;re just forgettable.<br />
If only the story did something, anything at all, but here it feels like the dots are either too random, too far from each other, or just simply don&#039;t get connected for whatever reason.<br />
If only the fanservice, heck even the queerbaiting was done on a level that goes above the safety threshold. It&#039;s not that that one can only see and feel it being used as a tool - for the most part, it&#039;s even below that. A boys-only private school begs for certain obligatory elements, most of which are outright missing and the ones that are present, are mostly just present as hints, rather than anything full-blown.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure what the creators wanted to achieve with this series, to be honest. Series like this, they usually either have great art/animation, or ample amount of fanservice, or some kind and amount of substance - none of those is present in Starmyu. Sure, there is such a thing as playing it safe, but what we get here is too safe. It&#039;s so safe it&#039;s just not enjoyable at all, as it fails to take full advantage of even the most overused tropes - tropes that are overused because they can still work if the dosage is right; here it isn&#039;t. And at the same time it also fails to deliver where it really should: music and songs. Some of the instrumental score in certain scenes was actually nice, but that&#039;s hardly gonna save an anime focused on musical students. You can watch it if you&#039;re absolutely deprived of BOYS in anime, I suppose, just don&#039;t expect anything of it. Then again, not being able to find an abundance of boys in anime is a pretty difficult spot to get to, isn&#039;t it?

    Alright, this is my first review and I am only doing it because I felt like this anime hasn&#039;t gotten enough attention and I will do anything for that to change.<br />
<br />
First off let&#039;s make it clear that this series is not AMAZING, not by itself neither for the genres it falls into. But it&#039;s not bad either, and I&#039;m seeing it get tons of low ratings in other sites. People aren&#039;t even giving it a chance.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The story&#039;s without a doubt the weakest point of the anime. It&#039;s generic, nothing special. A group of 5 failures trying to prove the world that they can actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207397">
        do things right and thus surprising everyone. That&#039;s the main plot, anyway. In the end of the series, tons of things happened that I would never have even imagined. Not like it was a big turn of events anyway.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
I honestly didn&#039;t like the art that much. It&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s nothing outstanding either. The character designs are simple, I could even say plain. And it feels like they were running out of hairstyles when they designed Kaito Tsukigami&#039;s brother, and simply decided to make him a blue-haired Kuga. But that&#039;s fine.<br />
I also never pay attention to the animation whoops. Sorry. But if it didn&#039;t get my attention, it&#039;s not terrible neither good.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I loved all of the songs, specifically the ending song and Ayanagi Showtime. Most of them sing well, but props to Team Hiragi for being 10 times better than the actual main five. KENN voicing Toraishi got me screaming every time he appeared onscreen.<br />
Then again Team Otori also has great voices, like Hoshitani&#039;s and Tsukigami&#039;s. I never pay attention to background music so I can&#039;t talk about it, but overall I think it was lacking.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
The main characters had plain personalities and fall into the generic archetypes. The main character is that generic &quot;let&#039;s give it our all &amp; let&#039;s all be friends&quot; leader. Honestly I love that kind of character, because let&#039;s be honest, if the leader was someone who did everything their own way or was too scared/shy to even talk to the members of their team no one would like them. Original? Yeah, that&#039;s the least you&#039;d be able to say about a leader like that.<br />
And the other characters, we have blue-haired Kaneki (or Kaito Tsukigami, whatever you prefer to call him) who feels overshadowed by his successful brother, purple-haired Kuga, better known as Haruto Tsukigami. There&#039;s the effeminate and motherly-type shy guy, Nayuki, that one guy that thinks he&#039;s better than everyone else, and the silent guy.<br />
Then why did I give the Characters such a high score? I&#039;m not going to lie, I love all of the secondary characters. Otori&#039;s amazing, and all of the five Team Hiragi guys are amazing as well, though I wish they&#039;d have gotten more screentime - they really didn&#039;t, but you can sort of distinguish their personalities with the little time they get.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I love music anime, but only when it&#039;s interesting enough to get me going. I really couldn&#039;t go past the first episode of Uta no Prince-sama, which has been compared to Starmyu by other people many times. I hate reverse harems, even if they&#039;re with singing boys. Just no.<br />
Starmyu had no romance, and I like it much better that way.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
Perhaps I scored everything a little higher than it would have actually been, but I really did like this show and despite being a little biased, it&#039;s not bad at all. If anything watch up to episode 3-5, give it a chance instead of dropping after reading the synopsis or after episode 1.

    Starmyu is not all that bad and here&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
tbh the plot is pretty cliche but if you dont have much expectations then this anime is for you. its the typical &quot;optimistic protag has a dream and finds friends along the way&quot; kind of anime, and like i&#039;ve mentioned earlier if you dont have much expectations then starmyu might just be for you. it&#039;s super easy to follow and understand, so i enjoyed the story well.<br />
<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
satisfactory. i&#039;m not that picky with animations so its fine by me. altho some may say otherwise, if you&#039;re able to look away and focus more on the story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400850">
        or point of the scenes then the animation won&#039;t be much of a bother. i admit there are some wonky scenes during the episodes, especially when the characters are dancing, but its not that bad. its honestly funny to see the expressions of the characters.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10<br />
since this is a anime that focuses on music, of course the sound should be amazing. personally, the songs were good. the soundtrack is alright, too, and there was no unnecessary parts or sounds that were out of place. i didnt skip the op so it grew on me each ep. and i appreciate the effort each seiyuu placed also for their charas, esp the singing parts since not all seiyuu are singers. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 8/10<br />
like i mentioned earlier, this is a pretty cliche anime. so the characters are kind of cliche for me, too. still, i liked them. i was looking for an easy to follow type of show, and i got that from starmyu because the charas were given enough backstory (more or less) to become their own person in the group. their interactions are really interesting and funny, too, so i have no complains. i felt like they were a bit ooc at times, but it was tolerable. im pretty sure we&#039;ll get to explore more of their charas and background (hopefully) in the next seasons.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10/10<br />
again, i was looking for an anime that was easy to follow and not very deep. starmyu gave me just that with the familiar character tropes, scenes and episodes that are seen in anime (if youve watched quite a lot already). theres always a solo act or a singing part when a character is introduced or has a moment; i found that pretty entertaining, plus it takes me back to some shows that are just like that as well. its the type of anime that makes you root for the charas, so if youre not very picky then you might get into this.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8/10<br />
i didnt expect, and i got to watch something pretty decent. starmyu is quite interesting so i recommend it if you want to watch a show to pass the time or maybe if youre into music. ALSO i lowkey thought some charas would have some sort of romantic relationship since the anime seemed to turn that way, but its almost subtle and not directly tackled per se. <br />
<br />
still, don&#039;t take every single detail that i just wrote here to judge the anime. watch it yourself, and you may get into it or see it in a different light than me.

    I finished watching season 1 + OVAs of Starmyu.<br />
<br />
Alright, so this literally feels like a musical. For me this was great. There are plenty (at least once/episode) of dance/song sequences, which I found really enjoyable. One of my favourite aspects of the series. I&#039;m a huge sucker for that sort of thing. On that note though I&#039;ll mention that the character designs are kind of bland, however I can&#039;t really fault the staff for this because of how much movement (dancing) needed to be animated. I didn&#039;t observe any CGI being used. There are a variety of cute dance outfits!<br />
<br />
The characters themselves were cute but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414794">
        in some cases were poorly/under developed. I suspect this will be somewhat remedied in later seasons. The cast is relatively large and the first season is only 12 episodes + 2 OVAs.<br />
<br />
The OST is decent. There are some good songs like character songs and such. I liked the ending sequence. <br />
<br />
In terms of writing, there is some &#039;forced drama.&#039; I loathe the term but I think it&#039;s accurate here. There&#039;s also plenty of ships to set sail. <br />
<br />
Overall the series is decent and it basically ‘does what it says on the tin.’ I rate it 7/10. If you like musical anime and/or boy idols then you&#039;d probably think it&#039;s decent. Appeal to a broader audience than that is limited though I think. <br />
<br />
Finally you should know that I may be biased because I have a soft spot for theater in general.
