Initially I gave this a 2. But having finished the show, I was wrong.<br />
<br />
This show is deceptively good, it&#039;ll have you think it is a terrible show, hence all the bad ratings. However this show is unique in that it goes all out with its premise, which I can appreciate.<br />
<br />
Now, why it looks bad:<br />
- Bad art and animation<br />
- Shoddy cliche characters<br />
- Bad character designs<br />
- etc etc<br />
<br />
Why it is actually good:<br />
I want to start this with stating that a show should be scored not in relation to other anime in general; this show is a flat 0 in comparison to the greats such as FMAB etc.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258836">
        Rather a show should be scored based on how well it does what it has intended to do, i.e entertain, inform, send a message etc.<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s purpose was to go all out in its premise and by doing so make fun of all the other shows like it that are afraid to break the status quo such as Blade Dance or Asterisk War, which just throw together templates and hopes for the best.<br />
<br />
- The show juxtaposes bad shows with its good writing around old and &#039;done-to-death&#039; concepts and characters. e.g. (ep3 spoiler)<br />
     - The MC&#039;s appreciation for slime monsters when they melt the girl&#039;s <br />
     clothes when lesser MC&#039;s would just blush and say it isn&#039;t right and <br />
     promptly get punched.<br />
<br />
- The MC&#039;s attachment to the morals of his old world and need to come to terms with the societal rules in the new world --&gt; This occurs in the last episode<br />
- The Author&#039;s balls when writing this s***<br />
<br />
Anyway go watch it, if you don&#039;t trust me check my list for my tastes and credibility.

    You know, when the main Japanese demographic your anime markets towards ends up hating your anime, then you know it blows chunks. Not even pretty girls can remedy that fact. I should’ve listened to OtaKing. Well, rationality is incomprehensible to anyone involved with this show&#039;s existence. If you don&#039;t want to see a rant on this crappy piece of work that is the cheap bootleg equivalent to Konosuba and an insult to harems, isekai, and entertainment, leave immediately. The gloves come off and the spell of death is cast.<br />
<br />
Creative bankruptcy. It&#039;s something that any artist of any medium worth his or her salt should dread

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258732">
        when creating a work. It&#039;s when the art has no soul of any kind, no artistic purpose behind it, meant only for the money. That brings us to our target: Isekai wa Smartphone. This pile of insufferable, bland, incompetent dreck can fuck off for giving harem and isekai shows a bad name (more so than they already have), and for not caring about being a show for people to watch. It has no soul, no drive, and is just an example of corporate greed and a lack of care by literally everyone involved in every aspect of production, outside of the voice actors. It is the antithesis of spellbinding, as it half-heartedly casts the spell of boredom and hatred.<br />
<br />
This anime can&#039;t establish anything properly. It can&#039;t establish magic until way after it was used and even then the system, especially concerning null, is stupid. It doesn&#039;t establish the idea of guilds properly at all. The gauntlets, the currency, none of it! Part of it is because its worldbuilding is beyond atrocious, and there are gigantic leaps and lies, so yeah. Oh, here’s an example! When a butler got hit with an arrow offscreen, how? Apparently he and the guys he was with were surrounded by lizards with swords and shields, so that can&#039;t work, and apparently part of it broke off and... yeah. Also, inconsistent magic since they say the only way to use magic (except maybe null) was with special designated crystals yet they violate that multiple times. Oh, and the protagonist knows literally every magic ever, including the personal null ones, which are already a bad system due to being contradictory (since they&#039;re supposed to be unique but they&#039;re recorded in ways that imply more people can use these null spells, but they&#039;re each limited to a few people at a time), and heck, the magic system as a while had its own tuned violated constantly with people constantly using elemental magic without a magical fragment catalyst, so fuck this anime’s own rules, amirite?! Oh, and they just randomly and haphazardly insert us into a bunch of scenarios for the characters to quickly solve and have no remote emotional effect on the audience or even have any meaningful things for the characters aside from them interacting and constantly blushing. God, this piece.<br />
<br />
Do I even need to mention that this is a generic piece of work with so many of the worst clichés of a typical LN and that it has some of the worst variations on them I have ever seen? Do I need to mention that this is basically an off-brand of Konosuba that actually went beyond an expiration date before airing? No? Well, too bad! What about the setting and story beats? Well, here’s something interesting: we don&#039;t know how MC-kun died! Think back to any Isekai you&#039;ve seen. Re:Zero? Subaru blinked and somehow fake into a fantasy world, unsure how it happened but he was summoned by Satela. Knight&#039;s &amp; Magic? Kurata (who we know as Ernesti in the fantasy world) got ran over, though we don&#039;t know how he got to his fantasy world. Konosuba? Kazuma died of shock and tricked a stupid cunt “goddess” into coming with him into a fantasy world. Here, well, God tells him that he was stuck by a bolt and then is willing to send him somewhere, we don&#039;t actually see what happened to him. It wouldn&#039;t have taken long to do something so basic, but look at what I&#039;m reviewing. It can&#039;t have a good sweet moment either since it ruins those, even though they don&#039;t even work in the first place, but way to ruin your theoretical chance, anime! Oh, and pacing is fucked with this one, especially in the first half. I know I&#039;m just sort of ranting and raving but damn, my brain is trying to scrape this show off of it and none of my friends want to kill this anime, so I have to now. This show has no effort put into anything at all; why should I bother? I would say because I care and because I try to put effort by honestly, my brain is committing genocide against any specifics I can bring up about this nightmare of a show.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think this anime had heard of this term I&#039;m about to say: it&#039;s called “characterization”! No character has a real defined personality, especially not the main character, who at best can be defined as the stereotypical boring and weak yet OP AF protagonist, like Ayato from The Asterisk War. By far this show&#039;s most disturbing and avant-garde offense is that I actually believe that all of the main women in the show are largely the exact same character with the most minor of different traits. No show to my knowledge has ever done that before. Obviously, these bitches are all trash, especially the tsundere one for being a typical tsundere. I can&#039;t remember any real traits from anyone else for this show has staged a coup on my brain!<br />
<br />
The other characters are bland and without personality and do stuff you expect, so that leaves us with MC-kun. Oh wait, I said everything about him other than the fact they he gets so OP without any actual progression that it constantly feels like he’s pulling powers out of his ass, and yes, he does get a harem, to the point where all of the members can even travel with him, it&#039;s their crowded a harem, and for next to no reason beyond “Dude is nice enough to help and can do crazy things” and not due to anything about his personality or even looks... ugh. His name is Touya, and I learned that over time but it&#039;s obviously not worth remembering. Actually, why should you remember a single character&#039;s name? Aside from weakling OP MC-kun, I certainly don&#039;t! There is nothing standout or remotely interesting about any of them. They also constantly blush and get embarrassed for no adequate reason. They&#039;re also all idiots as displayed by the crime-solving scene in episode 4. I only remember something about the blonde 12 year old princess and it&#039;s that she acts like a 6 year old half the time. Just...wow. I could go on and on about the character and especially the narrative problems, but honestly, this anime tries so little in any department that it&#039;s honestly not worth it.<br />
<br />
Veteran studio, Production Reed took the reigns for this and boy did they not do a good job, to put it lightly. The character art and overall animation are both so unbelievably flat, and so is the magic. It&#039;s not a pleasant view at any point, it all looks insanely plain, life-draining in fact! The character designs are pretty terrible overall, to add insult to injury. They can even get walking right as it looks like they&#039;re often moving both forward and backward in some walking scenes, like the beginning of episode 3. In fact, they always mess it up somehow, and it&#039;s just walking! How?! Why?! Oh, and when you see debris in a fight scene, it looks so poorly drawn and it doesn&#039;t fit well with any of the rest of the art at all. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect much animation in the fight scenes either, especially in the episode 7 duel with the awful looking wooden swords; and I thought Akashic Records was bad in that department. You can also see some rather noticeable errors here, like faces being off, the fact that one of the characters who has a sword suddenly had two swords with hilts on her sleeve and not her waist, and yeah, it’s pretty bad and lazy. They also use a lot of visual gag shortcuts that I thought only long-running shounens were allowed to get away with (since no other kind of show uses them and those shows have an insane amount of episodes to have to spread their budget and staff and time etc. on). It&#039;s a visual bore with blunders, though thankfully there really isn&#039;t any CGI to speak of, since I&#039;m sure that probably would&#039;ve been handled poorly, just like every there aspect of this show. You know, except it contains some atrocious CGI stairs that have a gigantic frame rate drop and get repeated verbatim later on with a different color and some abysmal fire effects that last for a while in episode 5! You know, because this anime also has to compete for the worst visuals of 2017 too!<br />
<br />
The main uniform the girls wear looks awful, especially with those lines in the white part. One of the character designs is blatantly ripped from the princess from Knight&#039;s &amp; Magic, whose anime adaptation just so happens to be airing at the same time as this, only she has been aged down by comparison to a 12-year-old. Why are we sexualizing 12-year-olds again? Also, expect some shitty digital close-ups. Lastly, for God knows what reason, they have it so that the eyebrows and eyelashes always overlap with the hair rather than being obstructed by it. This is basic anime shit and they constantly mess that up. Then again, they didn&#039;t really try here either, did they? Oh, and there’s a fair amount of reused animation, so that&#039;s a sin, especially since unlike Knight&#039;s &amp; Magic, this isn&#039;t a mecha show (not that I really excuse that show for it either). C’mon, it&#039;s 2017! This shit shouldn&#039;t be happening anymore! And.. .that&#039;s everything for this one. Sadly, this is somehow the show’s best, or rather, its least worst aspect, it only barely.<br />
<br />
For what it&#039;s worth, the OST on its own isn&#039;t actually that abysmal, though some tracks are especially bad and wrong. Sure, none of it works or can even be considered memorable, but what&#039;s worse is the fact that almost none of it ever fits with the scenes at all. Oh, and while I&#039;ll talk about those cancerous scene transitions a bit later and how pointless and aggravating they are in every way possible, let’s just say that the music makes matters worse in those moments. The OP is the most obnoxious and generic JPop song I have ever heard in my life, especially the techno aspects. Fuck this song, it&#039;s not worth naming since it&#039;s one of the worst OP songs I have ever heard. Same applies to the ED to a slightly lesser extent; it&#039;s also awful and I don&#039;t care which of the characters sings it. There is nothing of merit to the music in this show whatsoever, and that almost never happens. If that isn&#039;t sad, I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
You know, I have to ask: for those out there who actually enjoyed this anime, how? What is the appeal of this? Is it the fact that the main character is OP? Is it the fact that this is a world with magic? Is it the admittedly out there premise? Because... I don&#039;t see this as a show that really wants to entertain, like at all. I see no semblance of soul from this anime, no spirit or any enthusiasm from it or anything. It&#039;s not even just super bland to the point of feeling like it was meant for passive entertainment like some other perfunctory works out there. It&#039;s not like it even really attempts to have interesting, consistent, or involved fight scenes either. At best, it tries to pander with the whole slime nonsense, in ways that should probably be seen as an insult to the intelligence, or at the very least, ways that should be met with shrugs and groans. And as for the OP MC part, why? Isn&#039;t it boring to see some guy plow through anything, especially if he doesn&#039;t really do anything fancy or especially crazy and flashy, or have any personality to latch into while doing it? Wouldn&#039;t you want that kind of MC to have some actual personality or actually show off some crazy epic shit to cheese fights instead of cheering fights without any effort? Wouldn&#039;t you want someone like Izayoi from Problem Children over this main character? <br />
<br />
So it has come to this: the transitions! Fuck these things! They are nothing but obnoxious time-wasters with blaring and equally obnoxious music, either showing the results of a scene for 5 seconds or what happened already, with these stupid and obnoxious characters and voices doing stupid and aggravating things! You see anywhere from 6-8 of these an episode too! You can no doubt tell this got irritating fast! Why was this included? Why?! For comedy? I doubt it succeeded with many viewers.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, this show was boring and vexing as all hell. Not a single moment to enjoy. It doesn&#039;t even try so of course I feel unamused to the nth degree. Not to mention that there were a few specific moments (boob grab scene in episode 9 being chief among them) that were especially maddening, so that didn’t help one bit. Some of you might say “Why not just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride?” Because it&#039;s so fucking boring and stupid, that&#039;s why! If I didn&#039;t keep my brain permanently on thinking mode when watching anime, I’d have dropped so many more by now since I would&#039;ve quit the moment I got really angry bored from watching, hence more of my time would&#039;ve been wasted! I actually heard people say this was a parody of these kinds of shows: it is not. It image then completely straight and pretends to be mildly self-aware, so that blows. So yeah, this show fails on both levels! Fuck this show, I hate it! I hate it so much!<br />
<br />
This might prime some of you to ask: “Why did you watch this obviously bad show in the first place?” Well, some people probably watched it out of interest of the admittedly out there premise. Maybe some wanted a trashy anime to chill to (and likely found themselves still disappointed). And of course, some of us came here just to join hands with a chunk of the community always ready to see a truly and obviously terrible burn and revel in the flames together (I mean, usually the anime suffering that fate deserves it), often coming one by one to see if it is as bad as the reputation hypes it up to be. Not gonna lie, that was part of it for me. The other part was that for all intents and purposes, this did catch my eye as something I thought would just be a below-average at best isekai title for me to watch and feel little towards, at least after I was initially put off by the cover picture. However, I can definitely say that it did deserve the fate I mentioned in the third reason because as I have been saying over and over again, this anime is the very definition of laziness when it comes to this medium.<br />
<br />
Anime is a very intensive and passion-filled medium. There are so many titles out there, good and bad, that obviously show a ton of passion and effort in at least some regard. So, when I see an anime as lazy as this get a sizeable viewership while better and more passionate (if not always good) shows like Knight’s &amp; Magic, ACCA 13, and so on and so forth get at best a much lower viewership and at worst the absolute shaft, I get royally angry. People had to slave over this, and no passion feels like it’s coming out, no care put into anything regarding this show. I am so thankful that this show is getting quite a thrashing, and honestly, it needs all the hate it can get. Honestly, unless you really want to watch something without a soul, you should avoid this anime entirely, as this anime is an affront to the medium as a whole. Is it the absolute worst anime out there? No, there are some worse ones out there for their own reasons, but this anime really has no right to exist, and honestly, it is still very, very high up there, both in an all-time perspective and in the perspective of this season alone. It manages to be an affront to the concept of entertainment, and even the concept of a harem and isekai show. Sadly, this season isn’t over yet and there are a few real duds left to cover at the time of writing, so until then, I bid you adieu.

    &gt;&gt;If a well written anime series is a Mozart piece, this series is a bratty boy slamming his tiny fists on the same piano key over and over and over again while being obnoxiously proud of his musical prowess.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re familiar with the characteristic tropes of the isekai genre, you will spot a lot of them in this series. Some cliches are fun and entertaining, and having them really isn&#039;t a problem... unless that&#039;s literally ALL you do. There is no tension in this anime. Each and every time something interesting could happen, the show spits in your face as the problem at hand is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254426">
        solved within seconds by Gary Stu, our stupidly broken main character. The plot can be fully expressed by the following 4 lines of text:<br />
<br />
1. Someone has a problem which nobody can solve - IF ONLY somebody could use THAT ONE specific spell that would immediately solve the problem!<br />
2. Gary Stu comes along by coincidence and uses THAT ONE spell.<br />
3. The problem is solved, Someone falls for Gary Stu.<br />
4. Back to 1<br />
<br />
The only measure of plot progress in this series is the number of girls that are in love with the main character. At any point in the series, if you can think of multiple variations of how the plot might play out, you can almost be certain that the show will choose the blandest of them. Every character in the show can be fully expressed in less than 10 words, a fact that won&#039;t change no matter how many episodes of screentime they get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, for the technical part:<br />
<br />
Art and animation are painfully mediocre, nothing stands out except for some really terrible lip synching.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack&#039;s only purpose is to tell you how you should feel at any given moment. Sadly, it doesn&#039;t do a good job, for it only leaves you with feelings of disgust and shame as you ponder what went wrong in your life for you to end up watching another episode of this atrocity.<br />
<br />
Now, if you are really bored and still want to watch this show, all of the following leisure time activities will probably leave you more satisfied:<br />
<br />
       + Watching a good series instead<br />
       + Reading a book<br />
       + Laying in bed<br />
       + Staring at a brick wall<br />
       + Watching paint dry<br />
       + Repeatedly slamming your fingers with a door<br />
       + Doing literally anything else<br />
<br />
                                       <br />
TLDR:<br />
If you want a comprehensive guide on how NOT to do writing, this has got you covered.<br />

    This is my first time ever writing a review, so here goes...<br />
<br />
This is not your typical anime- or I mean it is (it&#039;s practically entirely tropes), but you shouldn&#039;t look at it like you would a typical anime, or else you&#039;re gonna absolutely hate it.<br />
<br />
Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is, as the name suggests, an &quot;another world&quot; anime. Take that genre, and think of every stereotype and trope imaginable. Throw them all together, and you get this show. <br />
<br />
Dude dies, God feels bad, sends him to another world, he gets a better life than before, he gets a harem, he&#039;s op as hell, everything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254432">
        is as convenient as can be, the list goes on...<br />
Seems like pure garbage.<br />
<br />
But that is not where the value of this anime lies. The reason I&#039;m giving it a 7 overall is because it&#039;s refreshing.<br />
<br />
Now hear me out: it&#039;s not revolutionary, it&#039;s not beautiful, it&#039;s not emotional- in fact, it feels very clunky, has odd pacing every now and then, and doesn&#039;t offer much.<br />
But I&#039;ll be damned, this show has me smiling way more often than some of your other run-of-the-mill shows in it&#039;s genre.<br />
<br />
Why? Because it&#039;s so bad it&#039;s good.<br />
This show is like eye bleach to me.<br />
<br />
After watching tons and tons of the same stories/genres spun different ways, you can get tired out. This show is one where I can just sit back and relax. I already know everything that&#039;s going to happen, and I laugh and smile because it&#039;s exactly what I expect it to be, and because it&#039;s so dumb.<br />
<br />
Maybe I&#039;m just going crazy from all the time I spend watching anime.<br />
<br />
Watching this anime helps me appreciate the other stuff I watch, because it almost in a sense helps me reset, seeing as I&#039;m so desensitized to all the uniqueness out there nowadays.<br />
<br />
Trust me, this anime is no life-changer, and it is most definitely not for everyone.<br />
But if you&#039;re like me, and just need a little break from the anime-watching grind, and need something &quot;other-worldly&quot; (sorry, I had to) to have a good laugh... then watch Konosuba, because it&#039;s actually good.<br />
But again, if you&#039;re like me, and you&#039;ve already seen it all, then yes, you can watch this, and appreciate it just like I do, appreciate it in all it&#039;s trope-y glory.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seriously is an anime I shouldn&#039;t like, but something in my brain and all the anime I&#039;ve watched makes me enjoy it. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a few of you out there who will agree... emphasis on &quot;few&quot;.<br />

    Objectively, the show isn&#039;t for everyone. It&#039;s predictable, basic setup (protag + harem), without much real development within the characters.<br />
HOWEVER!<br />
I quite enjoy the show because it has that OP main character that utilises his power, sure it&#039;s silly and overkill, BUT THAT MAKES IT ENJOYABLE!<br />
<br />
The plot is basically, MC dies - god sends him to a new world - gets some buffs - becomes OP to shit from day 1 - comedy follows.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think this show is meant to be taken seriously, but more for just enjoying what&#039;s there. I&#039;ve seen some negative reviews where people are saying it&#039;s completely shit, so here&#039;s how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254449">
        I&#039;d statistic it:<br />
Story - 4 (It&#039;s pretty basic so far).<br />
Art - 8 (The art style is nice and definitely supports the type of show)<br />
Sound - 7 (There&#039;s nothing really special, but your basic shiz, still nice though)<br />
Character - 4 (Although they&#039;re likeable, there&#039;s not really much development)<br />
Enjoyment - 9 (Personal preference, I love any OP char)<br />
Overall - 7 (I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see some OP main char use magic basically).<br />
<br />
Hope the review was helpful guys, if you want to see a overpowered character use all the magics in the world, go check it out ;)

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />

(The Very Definition of a Generic ‘Isekai’ Show)<br />
<br />
Noticing the word ‘isekai’ in the title, reminds me of the many related series and mangas that I’ve seen and read.  Most, if I recalled, were pretty enjoyable and entertaining.  I guess, you could say I enjoy the ‘Isekai’ genre to a certain extent.  However, this series just yells with genericness from its lame title and boring synopsis to its dumb-looking thumbnail to its list of genres (i.e. adventure, Harem, Comedy, Magic, Romance, Fantasy) that are commonly found in fantasy romance-comedies.  With all this information in mind, I immediately knew that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258697">
        this show would be absolute shit.  Still, I watched it because I wanted to know how generic it was.  So, I took some notes and noticed some common ‘isekai’ tropes: <br />
<br />
– Protagonist is killed (in this case, God kills him with lightning) and is, then, transported to another world.<br />
– Overpowered, dense Protagonist with no redeeming features, beyond being nice and kind to everyone.<br />
– Typical medieval setting.<br />
– Standard magical spells and elements (e.g. earth, wind, fire, etc).<br />
– Various races and creatures with different languages (e.g. lizard men, fox girls, slimes, etc).<br />
– Twin female adventurers in love with Protagonist (obviously they have purple hair).<br />
– Samurai girl in love with Protagonist.<br />
– Rich Princess falls in love with Protagonist at first sight, declares marriage, and the parents approve it.<br />
– Exploring ruins (e.g. underwater ruins and underground ruins)<br />
– Fanservice (e.g. clothes dissolving, clothing changing, boob grabbing, swimsuits).<br />
– Typical quests (e.g. collect X amount, kill this monster, explore this area, etc)<br />
– Typical “boss” monster fights (e.g. dragon, “unknown” creature, etc )<br />
– Protagonist gains a ‘free mansion’ and every female lead lives with him.<br />
– Protagonist continuously reusing overpowered skill (i.e. slip)<br />
– Protagonist creates a ‘gun’ in a fantasy world.<br />
– Protagonist forms a pact with the strongest spirit animal (i.e. tiger).<br />
– &#039;Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girl’ Event.<br />
– Slime Event.<br />
– Beach Event.<br />
– Harem Ending.<br />
<br />
Yep, we have it all, folks.  Some of the most common ‘isekai’ tropes are in this anime.  Now, whether that’s good or bad is up to you.  For me, it usually doesn’t bother me, but, in this show, it was was more annoying than outright fun.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
The story is simple and predictable, especially towards the end.  Nothing too complex or “deep”, or nothing that will confuse the viewers.  In fact, if I had to summarize this series, it would be this: OP main character is trapped in a new world, OP main character encounters many people with many problems, OP character solves the problem with his OP skills and spells, rinse and repeat.  Some examples:<br />
<br />
Examples #1: the butler is shot with an arrow, but wait Touya can just remove the arrow and heal him back to normal.  He doesn’t die and everyone is happy.<br />
<br />
Example #2: The Duke’s wife is blind.  If only someone had a spell that could heal her and make her see again.  Enter Touya, he uses heal.  The Duke’s wife can see again, everyone is happy.<br />
<br />
Example #3: Evil guy is controlled by evil red orb thingy in his eye.  How do we get it?  Enter Touya, he uses some retrieve magic and destroys it.  Evil guy is defeated and everyone is happy. <br />
<br />
For everything else: Touya uses the spell ’slip’ on enemy.  Enemy slips like an idiot.  It’s Super Effective!<br />
<br />
We can keep on going, but basically there is no tension, conflict, or buildup to these events.  And even if there was some tension, conflict, or buildup, they will be conveniently and immediately resolved within a matter of seconds because of Touya’s OP spells and powers.  In addition, there too many slice of life moments (e.g. Touya making ice cream, making a board-game, making a bicycle, going out shopping, etc) that don’t add anything to the story or plot, they are just there to remind the viewers that Touya is a nice and kind person.  Additional problem with this anime include: simple and bland conversations and dialogue, unnecessary fanservice, the inclusion of too many chibi scenes/transitions, and lack of world-building.  The lack of world-building is pretty frustrating; our characters never question about the various races and languages, religions, regions of the world, governments, etc.  And even when our characters venture to a new land (i.e. Eashen), they never took the time to fully explore or learns about it.  And finally, Touya fails to fully use his smartphone for other purposes, besides using it as a map, checking mail/texts, and looking up information, until around episode 5 or 6.  And even then, the smartphone is nothing special, it’s just there to enhance his already overpowered skills.  But, the most disappointing thing was the fact the anime doesn’t show our main character getting killed by lightning.  Would have been more entertaining had they animate it.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION:<br />
<br />
The background designs, such as buildings, interior designs, forests, etc, are lacking in detail and are just there to show where the our characters are.  The character themselves aren’t very detailed either, in fact, one could say that all the main characters have pretty similar looking facial designs, in that everyone has a pointy chin and a rectangle face.  They only differ in eye color, hair color and design, and what clothes they are wearing, but that’s pretty obvious.  Most crowd scenes just feature static characters, and if there are multiple characters moving it’s usually a fight scene.  Now, speaking of fight scenes, the animations for these scenes are a mixture of still and dynamic shots of the characters punching, kicking, or slashing something.  And finally there are many chibi scenes, which are cute, but, at the same time, are annoying and interrupt the flow of the episode.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
If you have seen Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and its sequel, then you’ll be glad to know that several voice actresses have a major/minor role in this series.  Specifically, Maaya Uchida voices Elze Silhoueska (elder twin), Chinatsu Akasaki voices Yae Kokonoe, Sumire Uesaka voices Leen, and Kikuko Inoue voices Origa.  The remaining cast is voiced either by professionals or novices, especially our main character, Touya Mochizuki, who is voiced by Katsumi Fukuhara, a complete newbie starring in his first major voicing acting role.  Now, having said all this, the voice acting is okay, not the best, but decent.  Moving on, the background songs are just there to convey the characters’ emotion at that given moment; the sounds of swords clashing, magic effects, and many other action sound effects are standard for its genre.  Though, I’ll admit hearing the ’boing’ sound effect whenever boobs swayed or jiggled around was stupid and hilarious.  And finally, the opening song and intro is your typical J-Pop that introduces all the girls that love our protagonist, and the ending song, also your typical J-Pop, features only one female character at a time.  By the way, it&#039;s kind of stupid to include two characters (i.e. professor and silver-haired dude) that only made a brief, and by brief less than a minute, appearance on screen.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
<br />
Every character has a readily established character trait and personality that will remain with them until the end of the show.  In other words, characters introduced in the beginning will not change throughout the show; they will not have any growth or development and no change in personality.  And, for some reason, we aren’t given a proper background story to most of our main characters.  For example, our main character, Touya Mochizuki, is nice and kind, is dense and completely oblivious to the girls’ feelings for him, and is overpowered because of God.  That’s it.  He doesn’t tell us about his former life, nor does he have any desire to do so.  Furthermore, he lacks any specific goals or ambitions when he enters the new world, and barely reacts to any situation or event.  A very boring and generic character, indeed.  <br />
<br />
The female characters, despite looking and acting cute sometimes, are no better than our male lead.  In fact, most are common character tropes, such as the tsundere, the shy younger sister, the rich princess, the girl that-appears-young-but-is-actually-hundreds-of-years-old, the traditional girl, etc.  Moreover, they don’t have any background story (except for samurai girl, Yae Kokonoe), and lack any goals and ambitions, besides wanting to get married to Touya.  Everyone else is a secondary character, so don’t expect any backstories or any character development; they are just there to make certain events happen to our main characters. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
<br />
I’ll be honest, this show is boring, predictable, and lacking the humor, thrills, and intensity compared to similar shows.  The story is painfully generic and lacks tension and conflict, the animation and art is just there for show, and the characters are stale and unchanging.  The only entertainment I got from this series was anticipating when Touya would pull the ‘Slip’ card and defeat his “enemies”.  Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this show, unless you like the original source material and wanted to see the anime adaptation of it, or you are a huge fan of ‘isekai’ tropes.

    Have you expected something big to the new Isekai series will be released this season?<br />
<br />
More like you can truly enjoy all those suffering things lessons like how Re:Zero taught us in every point aspects which surviving within greedy desires he deserves that dragged him from different turn which means how you loop scenarios all over again. Or A place where you started an adventurer where you had a misfortunate party filled with bonkers. Unless none of them even less amazing compare to this show.<br />
<br />
Oh Production Reed, How can you manage to adapted something so bland from a web novel without progression and thrill or whatsoever.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254402">
        <br />
<br />
A deadpan MC who had no choice to accept he&#039;s dead and received powerful weapon which you called &quot;SMARTPHONE&quot;.. that can released more than magic like how A &quot;Gary Stu&quot; possessed.<br />
<br />
Look two sisters, isn&#039;t that great more Fan- *Excuse me*. They avoided some tropes which even more boring as ever and already joining in the party by choice at the first scenario, Huh? that makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
A girl in a Kimono outfit that exist in the different world who knows a lot swordsmanship eh? Is that it?, Can they explained their bloodlines or any flashbacks about herself. Actually not of that happen.<br />
<br />
And Lastly with an illegal age you want to married in the near future, Such a pushover when the royal of the kindom had no hesitations about the illegimate thing to do onto such petty reasons. Goodluck to you and may best to wait for more than a half year as you go into a deep chamber once you got locked down.<br />
<br />
Overall Impression : Low <br />
<br />
Seriously recommending this ISEKAI show was just a big joke and didn&#039;t live through my expectation

    This anime is just like any other isekai story out there whether it be another manga,Light novel etc..<br />
It goes for the same cliches you saw a million times over, the all so familiar character designs and traits.<br />
But even tough it&#039;s not very original, or doesn&#039;t have the best written story out there, any good character progression, or even an amazing soundtrack that gets you in to the mood. <br />
It&#039;s still worth watching if you actually watch anime for fun and not as some kind of critic or sport.<br />
<br />
I find that there is no point in looking in to it&#039;s flaws because there are too many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255543">
        plot holes and nothing very amazing about it to distinguish it from the others, other than the fact that this show is extremely enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Anime as a media is meant to be enjoyed. It&#039;s not like art, or music where it has to be incredibly complex,  it just need to make your day or lighten up your mood from other stress in your life and that&#039;s just what this show does.<br />
 <br />
It&#039;s relaxed, stupid, and has that overpowered mc that is kinda cool.<br />
So just like any anime this is rated based off of my enjoyment and i give it a clean 10.<br />
I can&#039;t and won&#039;t say you will enjoy it as much as me because everyone has different tastes but this show is worth trying out.<br />
Thank you for reading, hope you liked the review. :)<br />

    Throughout the generations of anime, we have been given the genre called &#039;&#039;Isekai&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;In Another World&#039;&#039;. From the video game genre of Isekai like Log Horizon and SAO, to the parallel world Isekai like Konosuba and then this anime, we all loved and hate the genre as well.. Summer 2017 season will end soon and for the past few months, it brought us a few Isekai animes. One of them is &#039;&#039;Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;In Another World With My Smartphone&#039;&#039;. Now, when I first look at it from it&#039;s poster, I thought the anime will be good and comedic like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258703">
        Konosuba... Like Konosuba.. with a Smartphone! But sometimes, when you make higher expectations to something especially anime, it bounds to fall down. And it really did for this anime. &#039;Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni&#039; revolves to the protagonist named &#039;Mochizuka Touya&#039; who accidentally died, so.. God is like &#039;&#039;Im going to revive you into a Magical world cause you accidentally died &#039;&#039; blablabla. You know you should have just revive him &#039;&#039;God&#039;&#039; lol. On this review, I will talk about the story, characters, the sound, art, my enjoyment of it and overall rating. Don&#039;t worry there will be no spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The isekai genre have been widely popular throughout the anime so it is not that original anymore, though it is said that all stories are not really unique or original itself. Some are base on real life situations while some are based on made-up/fictional things. The same to this anime. Lack of originality of the show for viewers are already a problem of this show. Guy goes into another world and he has multiple harem girls with him and he is freaking overpowered? Common.. The story revolves about &#039;Mochizuka Touya&#039;, a normal boy in the real world, turned into a guy that has so many selection of girls. Hell! he can marry anyone of them because he is ridiculously overpowered not only by his power but charisma (though his face looks like someone I know from another anime out there). If you are going to take a look on the following episode, the route of the story is like this - He is OP. He helps with his OP powers then he met new girls for his harem then go to an adventure/quest, then again he helps another set of girls for his harem and so on and so on. This guy doesn&#039;t know that he is collecting girls like Ash catching Pokemons in the wild. If one character is already a mess (no balance or over the top), the viewers will think that he can do anything he wants even there will be an impossible problem. Viewers will always think the story will go on without having a major problems/conflicts because of an OP Main character. If the villain or a supporting character is OP than the main, then I think it is fine. So.. Because of the MC&#039;s overpowered abilities and continuous/ongoing set of route of collecting girls, the story is horrible...<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The story is bad itself.. But on the other hand, I can say that the Art is pretty good and normal for an isekai anime. I mean we don&#039;t need over the top animations like on the &#039;Fate&#039; series for this anime because of the story&#039;s bad route and all so the art is not a big deal here at all..<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Like the art itself, the sound is pretty normal like any other animes out there. The sound effects of the spells, the slashing of both sword, the background music. No major problem at all on this series.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
This anime proves that there is someone more OP than Kirito from SAO himself. That&#039;s what makes this anime pretty bad. The character balance between the official main character (Touya) and the other main character ( the first harem girls with him ), along with the supporting characters have intense differences of balance from power, fame, charisma and other things. This makes the author to make a story to FOCUS ALL the good things to him with almost no bad sides at all. Problems will come yeah sure but because of him being OP, he can erase that problem very easily.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
With his cringy attitude and overpowered mechanism, I don&#039;t really enjoyed this anime at all. Though there are some parts that have some slight &#039;ecchi&#039;-ness, though I can say that the whole problem is the anime itself. The fights are... Well we can all predict that he will win along with his harem girls thats why the fights are not that enjoyable or entertaining. Viewers can predict what will happen and then it turns out they are right because of what they see from the MC himself.<br />
<br />
Overall... I rate this anime as 4/10. Sure there are plenty of fine fights and pervy moments but because of this kind of flow on the story, the rating for this anime (for me) is less than average. A poor grade.<br />
<br />

    This anime is one of the more inventive animes of this year, if not the decade. Remember times when you had to have something in your anime? Something worth watching it for? Well those days are over!<br />
Character development? Forget about it!<br />
Original character design? Please, it just distracts the viewer from the real thing that&#039;s happening! <br />
What&#039;s happening? WHO KNOWS? That&#039;s the beauty of it!<br />
Plot and a fun way of telling the story? Who needs all that nonsense!<br />
Intense and thrilling moments? Please, this is 2k18!<br />
Comedy? Comedy is for kids we are all grown up here!<br />
So what are you waiting for? You better start watching this masterpiece

    So if you are a BIG Romance/Harem anime person like me, then you will surely love this anime like I am. Yes, its got its cliches, yes its got its predictable moments, BUT I don&#039;t let that get the better of me at all.  In fact, if you are a heavy harem/romance anime nerd like I am, you&#039;d enjoy the cliches and predictable moments like I do!<br />
<br />
Honestly I know that tons of people will rip this anime a new one just because of XYZ reasons which is unfortunate, but TO ME, I am thoroughly enjoying this anime so much. <br />
<br />
So far going from 4

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254604">
        episodes so far, it is really fast paces which I really enjoy. The Main Protagonist Guy is the perfect guy I always liked in harem/romance. Super nice, super level-headed, always being a gentleman, and so far he doesn&#039;t get all &quot;nose bleed&quot; like most dudes in harems which is great. He&#039;s also super strong which is great in my book. <br />
<br />
TO ME I am really enjoying this anime. Maybe I&#039;m easy to please? I guess I am, which is great since that means there are many shows out there that I can enjoy!

    Truly a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
From the unapologetically overpowered character to the girls falling head over hells at first sight, all of it weaved through a plot that barely holds together, plot holes a car could fall through and events that are just simply too convenient happening left and right, this series offer you everything the Isekai genre has to propose in one neat convenient package, allowing you to safely skip any anime of the genre from now on and forever.<br />
<br />
Believe me.<br />
<br />
Honestly tho, the girls are nice, and at least it&#039;s less cringe-worthy than Bakemonogatari.<br />
<br />
And of course this depends on your view of the genre and anime itself.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254827">
        From an entirely comedic standpoint I like to believe that the creators of the series are aware of the image the series project and that this was intentionally a parody of the genre, especially seeing how low-budget it is.

    this is the first time i wrote a review of this.<br />
<br />
anime isekai wa smartphone to tomo has a good storyline. but many scenes from this novel LN are being cut off when adapted into anime.<br />
<br />
it would be nice some scenes LN do not cut a lot of scenes when adapted into anime. the plot will be more interesting than usual.<br />
<br />
I think this anime is good. in terms of the story, the character of his voice and others. but the drawback is a lot of scenes that many missed during the adaptation into anime.<br />
<br />
I am currently very fond of where the main male characters have incredible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256513">
        strength without the need for long training.<br />
<br />
it would be nice if the main character of the man has tremendous strength but must require long and heavy training. to make the story more exciting<br />
<br />
and I give the value<br />
story: 8<br />
art: 8<br />
sound: 8<br />
charakter: 9<br />
enjoyment: 8<br />
overal: 9<br />
<br />
this anime has a very good story, and nice to watch<br />
<br />
I feel sure there are people out there agree or disagree with my review of this

    Before i answer the question: should i watch this show or not, let me ask you 2 things.<br />
1: Are you one of those who hate watching Anime and have fun with the ridiculous parts and die from laugher?<br />
2: Are you searching only serious Anime which follow a standard story line?<br />
Oh god then no don&#039;t even bother searching this show.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand you&#039;re just like me who LOVES watching shows that are stupidly hilarious (that doesn&#039;t stand all the time, sometimes i too want some serious anime shows to enjoy) and want to just pass some time laughing your ass off, HELL YEAH WATCH

I&#039;ll give a brief explanation of what happens mainly in the first episode so i wont spoil anything, we have our MC Touya who all of a &quot;sadden&quot; gets hit by a thunder and dies, well um that being a huge and stupid mistake from non other than.... god himself, he decided to give Touya a second chance but unfortunately he can&#039;t be sent back to the world he lived, so he gets sent to another magical world, of course god didn&#039;t let him go like that he implanted magical powers and skills in order to help him survive in this world.<br />
After his arrival to the world he meets up with some girls and registers in a guild from where he is able to get some job quests in order to make a living.<br />
<br />
Artwork and Sound are nothing special, they have nothing special to offer so do not expect to be mesmerized by its beauty.<br />
<br />
The characters are made to make you laugh and nothing more, there is no back-story there is no huge goal or anything, just funny moments being unfolded between them.<br />
<br />
That is why i gave this show an overall rating of 8 points, it makes me cry from laugher and its been quite a while since i last had this much fun, trust me you wont regret if you&#039;re like me ;).

    First of all ,this is a kind of refreshing anime which I love  Because I am actually fed up of most of other genre .I like anime with paralell world+comedy+harem+magic+op mc.<br />
Unfortunately such genre always become crap.<br />
<br />
 Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. is good and eye-candy anime,in regards of online views it shows its  true color even if its underrated in MAL. Personally I love cheerful and eye-candy anime like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.Anime like give me soothing comfort and relaxation.<br />
<br />
Story : A young boy named Touya Mochizuki was accidentally killed by god and reborn in a new magic world with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256021">
        Smartphone and   Max-out ability in magic ,stamina etc (OP),he becomes friends with twin sister ,go on a guild adventures and get more girls (harem).Became engaged to a princess,now they all together goes for a adventure.<br />
<br />
Art:Quite  good artwork but nothing so special about it.<br />
<br />
Sound:Music seems good and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Character:Character development also good.<br />
<br />
Overall I like this anime ,Its quite lovable and enjoyable (similar as a candy chewed).

    This show is like one of those poorly animated &quot;other world&quot; hentais.... with out the porn... there are LITERALLY thousands of other anime that you could be watching that are better than this show.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO STORY.... <br />
dude wakes up in another world and learns he is borderline Jesus with the ability to do just about anything through magic and has god on his cellphone. 2 episodes in and he only used his phone to look up how to make ice cream and taking a picture of a girl while she was sleeping...<br />
but people will still watch it and will pick up the LNs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254565">
        Figures.<br />
<br />
The animation is REALLY bad... 10 years ago shows like Baccano, Gurren Lagaan, Death Note, and Code Geass had just came out but this show looks worse than school days.

    I&#039;m glad I gave this anime a shot despite poor reviews.<br />
Turns out the reviewers were expecting something that they did not get...<br />
I just wanted to watch an Isekai. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t a masterpiece, but it kept me entertained and I liked the characters. <br />
<br />
The beginning felt a bit rushed as if we missed an episode, but I got over that quickly enough to not care.<br />
<br />
One thing I didn&#039;t care for was how the last few episodes started becoming a fanservice trope about female body parts. <br />
<br />
It was still enjoyable though.<br />
<br />
I recommend giving this a watch if you like Isekai, are not an anime snob that only

    This is my first review and most likely will be my last in a while. I just couldn&#039;t understand how people rated this so bad while I enjoy this as much as most other fantasy animes! Isekai is fun, light and carefree to watch with bit of comedy and is something you can watch to escape from reality when you aren&#039;t in a mood to watch 100% realistic or some sad drama animes or so.<br />
<br />
Isekai reminds me a bit of No Game No Life or Log Horizon in a way that main hero goes to another world due some reason, in Isekau because he dies

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254514">
        in his world and is sent to another one by god. Might sound weird but this is fantasy anime so you know it&#039;s not gonna be super realistic and logical anyway! The main heroes in each of these three animes are all kinda similar, all are quite OP in bit different ways on each of these animes. Also I think Fairy Tail is quite similar to Isekai as both have magic and OP main hero, but Isekai has only few episodes released so there isn&#039;t really many ways to compare these quite yet. The thing that separates Isekai from these others the most is that Isekai is harem while the others aren&#039;t.<br />
<br />
The story itself is like any other (harem) fantasy anime, harem side isn&#039;t imo too strong like the girls don&#039;t get too close with kissing or anything, but you can see the harem in there as most of female characters likes the main hero more or less and his group consists only of female characters so far.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t judge art styles usually too much, but imo art is quite neutral looking which is good. There is no any unique ways of drawing but it is simple and similar to many other animes and while it may not be super great, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad either.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say much about sound as I&#039;m that kind of person who skips openings and endings and as far as the sound used in the episodes goes, I don&#039;t think there is anything different or bad about them, so again quite basic what you are used to hear in most other animes too.<br />
<br />
Characters aren&#039;t especially super unique [quite basic OP and bit airhead main hero at least when it comes to reading female minds (as typical in many other animes, but it&#039;s quite logical as it is impossible to read girls&#039; minds irl too :D) and bit different female heroines] but they are all quite likable and you can find the one(s) that you like the most.<br />
<br />
I enjoy this anime as much as I enjoy many other fantasy animes. You won&#039;t end up even looking to this unless you like this genre and if you do like it, it&#039;s pretty much as good as other similar animes. This may still be missing some depth that you can find in Log Horizon or in Fairy Tail for example, but both of those series are long ones that progress slowly and you never know how this one is gonna progress and end until it&#039;s finished so I can&#039;t say for sure yet how I should rate this overall. For me ending is very important and also if there is hints of upcoming season(s) I want to see them and base my opinion to whole series and not just on few episodes or one season if there is more seasons.<br />
<br />
I hope this will help at least one of you guys reading this and if some of you find this helpful I might consider writing more reviews too! :)

    Isekai waka waka smartphone desu is the very definition of mediocrity.<br />
<br />
If mediocrity was a city, isekai famalama smartphone dingdong would be working a low paying office job in it.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t assume that this anime ever gets exciting just because it has isekai in its name -- because this anime is 100% through and through slice of life<br />
*spoilers ahead* nothing EVER goes wrong. (that being said it is still somehow more interesting than log horizon)<br />
<br />
Every episode before 12 goes like this: Touya and his incredibly boring harem go to a new location, they reach a threatening looking hurdle, touya dono casts slip and it falls over allowing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258739">
        him to claim victory<br />
The remaining 10 minutes of every episode is every character introcuded so far making loud guttery slurping noises<br />
<br />
WOW TOUYO DONO YOU ARE SO AMAZING LOOK AT THAT YOU MADE HIM FALL OVER WOW *SLURP SLURP*, even the &#039;kings&#039; of this world seem to have no pride and have no qualms about becoming touya&#039;s literal bitch at the first display of competence<br />
Episode 3ish is literally hey you did this job for me well, here fuck my daughter.<br />
<br />
So why did I rate it a 6 you ask? purely because the standard for anime is so low.<br />
That&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
Not recommended<br />
<br />

    In Another World with My Smartphone epitomizes everything that a great show like Konosuba is satirizing. Touya died by accident in the real world so G-d decides to give him another change in another world and he&#039;s allowed to take his phone with him, the only caveat being that the only person he can contact is the aforementioned &quot;G-d.&quot; He also sets him up with some buffs which gets revealed early on basically means he can miraculously control every type of magic and just by reading a spell that took others years to perfect, he can cast it. So long as he has the name

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254547">
        of the spell and can comprehend what it actually does, he can cast it.<br />
<br />
The best way to describe this show is ultimate teen male wish fulfillment. He has a harem of girls who all either overtly or secretly have crushes on him.  He has unheard of power that basically enables him to do anything.  And everyone is amazed at how awesome he is.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the beginning of this show&#039;s horrible execution. When your main character is simply UBER in ever single way, there are no real obstacles to overcome. The hero&#039;s journey is about evolving as a character and overcoming personal failings to succeed in trials. It&#039;s simply not interesting to watch a guy who has none and this is almost to the same degree as Ains in Overlord. Even in a show like Dragon Ball Z, where we know inevitably Goku will win, he faces obstacles greater than himself and he evolves (albeit somewhat predictably) to triumph.<br />
<br />
The entire concept of someone going to a fantasy world and being able to use their smartphone is a pretty neat idea. There are a ton of things one could do with a connection to information in the outside world. Presumably you could look up plans to introduce &quot;undiscovered&quot; technology or use it to bridge language divides in this other world. Instead all the character has really used it for is the maps function.<br />
<br />
The characters are beyond boring and to be honest other than very minor personality quirks, the characters literally have no personality. The main character looks almost exactly like Kirito from Sword Art Online. And if you ever complained that Kirito was flat and boring, he has nothing on Touya, who is probably the most dull character I have yet to see develop a mini-harem. The other characters introduced thus far are a stereotypical loli character who is a noble, a samurai who eats non-stop, and a pair of twins who are not really identical or fraternal but one is assertive and physically aggressive while the other is shy and submissive.  Rounding out there party is the king&#039;s daughter, who is instantly obsessed with marrying Touya.  And her parents have no qualms with it because of a magical eye and seem perfectly okay with leaving the running of their kingdom to a child they have known for half a day, at most.<br />
<br />
I originally wrote this review at only two episodes in and nearly every one of my predictions already came true.  Now only four episodes in the only thing I&#039;ve not predicted is when go to the beach. 50/50 chances of a nosebleed.<br />
<br />
Finally, I might be able to forgive the story a bit if there was something else to latch onto but thus far the art has been pretty mediocre and music has been very generic. The dialogue between the characters and their &quot;adventures&quot; feel more like something you&#039;d see in a bargain bin visual novel game.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why I am going to subject myself to watching this if only to really see if my predictions hold true and if somehow it gets better.
