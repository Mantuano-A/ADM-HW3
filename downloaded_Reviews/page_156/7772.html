    In order to clear up any misunderstandings that may have been generated through very few positive reviews, I have taken it upon myself to bite my tongue, tie up my feet and force myself to relive the nightmarish days of woe, courtesy of Studio Matrix.<br />

As anyone with half a functioning brain - or a full half-functioning brain - could figure out, Green Green is another zombie in the anime industry&#039;s beloved legion of &quot;ecchi harem&quot; animes. Typically raised by necromancers of the &quot;Let&#039;s-Impress-the-Writer&#039;s-Guild Association&quot;, these menaces are armed with bright colours, not enough clothes, and a textbook full of dialogue and characters so embarrassing that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24843">
        you&#039;ll want to hide the screen in shame. When I say textbook, I mean that they&#039;ve been written to death, like the pen torture from Harry Potter, only it has emptied the archetypes out and filled them with sugar and fat and everything that sells. <br />
<br />
Naturally, you will have seen a few of these, and thus should be familiar with the horrifying habits that they get into. Green Green is one that seemingly strays away from these habits, although I don&#039;t think it would want to be accused of doing something original, considering that everything in it has been cut from other animes and strewn with sticky porn magazine cutouts. What I mean to say is that it touches on new grounds in the ecchi department, or new heights, as I should probably call it. Of course, there is the issue of recycled characters, as if the writers had never seen an anime before, or maybe seen one just like this and loved it. Every male in the show is a perverted cretin, guilty of nearly every kind of sexual harassment, except the main character, who of course wants nothing to do with either that or character development. Completely oblivious to the inevitable harem that has sprung up (like that bamboo earlier in the series), he fumbles his way through the story, only looking up at the orb of pureness and perception that he so valiantly holds up to the uniformly blue sky. He continues to do this for the entire series, as his supporting cast wages war on one another with fishing hooks, drill-shaped bamboo shoots, and hot-tubs, the latter of which is used in a truly innovative scene involving what I&#039;m sure would be plagiarism had this anime been censored. You should be able to watch the opening to decide if you should watch the first episode, and should be able to use that to skip to the last episode. If you guess wrong about what will happen, then feel free to eat your shoe.<br />

Depending on how new you are to anime, you might be charmed by Green Green&#039;s colour and innocence, despite the horrifying images that will likely be carved into your retinas. Not to say that it is innocent in the traditional way, but innocent in that it is a young creature that has not yet delved into the dark side of creativity and intelligence. It&#039;s understandable; anime is a sugar-coated piñata filled with cream puffs, breast-shaped stress balls and helium, but no matter how innocently retarded Green Green may seem, it still tries to fuck everything in sight, and your eyes will be no exception.

    ===Animation===<br />Quite nice and steady animation. The character designs are a bit on the simplistic side, but they are nice to watch. Funny scenes are drawn very well, and there are quite a few of them. You will find a lot of ecchi (especially panty shots and the &quot;top part&quot;) in this series, but not just light stuff. In my honest opinion this series does touch the border of hentai with some scenes...<br /><br />===Sound===<br />Now this is something that raises the overall rating of the series by quite a fair margin. The opening tune is average, but the ending done by YURIA is something that makes me want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30">
        to learn how to play an electric guitar. The tune is really catchy and the vocals are superb; as expect of YURIA... Another praise goes to the background music, which has especially nice piano pieces.<br /><br />===Story===<br />An aspect on which I can&#039;t write too much about. It was poor; A girl suddenly appears and just doesn&#039;t stop harassing the main male character. I won&#039;t give any spoilers, but the storyline is explained very briefly and poorly, and the ending is rushed. Side stories kind of balance this fact, since they were fairly good, but not complex enough to reveal all aspects of the characters.<br /><br />===Characters===<br />Since this is a shounen anime you can expect quite a few (cute) female characters, which this anime successfully delivers. Each of them is different. Some girls are normal, one is tsundere, another is very shy and then you have the weird ones as well. Oh, and we can&#039;t forget the teacher with a large chest. As you can see, this is quite a typical aspect of this kind of genre. Most of the female characters have their own side stories, with the main male character of course, which give us an inside into their life and personality, but none of them are developed enough (perhaps playing the game would help here). <br />Now onto the male characters; There are quite a few of them. The main male character is the most important one of course. He&#039;s a typical &quot;good and nice&quot; guy that you&#039;ll find in most harem animes. Now, all the remaining characters are simply ugly perverts as described by the female characters. They are there to provide entertainment, and they do it well. It all makes me sometimes wonder: &quot;What is this main character doing in a school filled with pervs and rejects. He doesn&#039;t even fit there at all?!&quot;<br /><br />===Enjoyment===<br />As I mentioned before this series does contain some good comedy, even though some scenes can be questionable (and some take it too far). It was a good watch, but it&#039;s not the weak core plot that makes it good. It&#039;s the characters and situations that they get into that count. To sum all this up, rewatching the whole series just for the plot would be a waste of time, but as for the rest I wouldn&#039;t have any objections.

    What would happen if you took a Japanese porno game, removed all the sex scenes, and released it as an anime so people could enjoy the ingenious plot? On the good end of the spectrum with &quot;good&quot; being a relative term, you get Fate Stay Night. On the unholy end of the spectrum you get the evil known as Green Green!<br />
<br />
plot: 1/10<br />
<br />
Green Green is about an all male school located in the middle of nowhere that suddenly has female guest students for a few months as a social experiment. Now the boys must spend those months trying to get into the girls&#039; pants. That&#039;s it.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181489">
        That&#039;s the entire plot. The reason Fate Stay Night worked was because it actually had a plot and characters beyond a bare bones set up for characters to start banging! Even Seikon no Qwasar tried harder than this to develop a plot! Green Green has the plot complexity of a seedy 1970s porno with Ron Jeremy or John Holmes. A pizza delivery guy goes over to a hot chick&#039;s house and suddenly the power goes out. We took out all the fucking scenes so...they sit around and do nothing. End. Fin. Das Ende<br />
<br />
characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
 Our bland and shitty MC is named Yusuke, NOT to be confused with infinitely better MCs of the same name. The other main characters are a trio of bumbling idiots called appropriately... the &quot;idiot trio&quot;. Dear GOD do I hate these 3 guys! They are some of the most loathsome, obnoxious, odious characters I have ever seen in an anime. They are supposed to be the comic relief, but instead they simply cause the viewer to grind his or her teeth into dust. They were supposed to have an annoying yet likeable dynamic similar to Team Rocket from Pokemon. However, I could never hate Jesse, James, and Meowth like I hate these fuckers no matter how stale and repetitive the Team Rocket Motto got after 300 episodes. Imagine you took Team Rocket&#039;s level of redundant obnoxiousness, but replaced Jesse, James, and Meowth with: Shou Tucker from FMA, Makoto from School Days, and pedo stepfather from Elfen Lied. THAT would be like the Idiot Trio from Green Green!<br />
<br />
art and sound: 3/10<br />
<br />
The art looks pretty shitty, although the animators at least tried to add boob jiggle effects. The boobs look awful, but I guess I will give them a point for effort. The soundtrack...was garbage. The opening theme is J-pop ear sodomy, the background music may as well not exist, and the closing theme is more ear sodomy. The voice acting is some of the worst I have EVER heard in any anime and I have seen most of the Central Park Media titles! This is on par with fucking Garzey&#039;s Wing! Also in case anyone involved with the US dub of Green Green is reading this, the name is pronounced Yuse-kay. 2 syllables. It is NOT yu-SU-kay. You dumb bastards!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: &quot;Tamakeri&quot; / 10<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t know what tamakeri is? Google it bitches!<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
<br />
Green Green wanted to just be another harem comedy. It aimed for mediocrity and ended up with an absolute TRAIN WRECK of a show! I have no idea how the hell this happened. It isn&#039;t that hard to make a mediocre harem anime worthy of a 4 out of 10. Green Green just sucked a golf ball through a garden hose in every category. <br />
<br />
PS:<br />
<br />
I shouldn&#039;t use a real life tragedy to make a joke, but I couldn&#039;t mention Green Green without bringing up a certain &quot;elephant in the room&quot;. Green Green is SO bad that it may have actually helped push a famous, mentally unstable anime critic over the edge. In the early days of youtube, one of the most popular and subscribed to anime critic was a guy named &quot;Mr Anime&quot;. His last review was Green Green in which he was foaming at the mouth with rage at how bad this series was...then the next week he went on a murder spree and is now in jail for life with no chance of parole! Obviously Green Green can&#039;t cause neurological disorders, but could it have possibly helped give him that final push by making him REALLY angry? It can&#039;t be entirely ruled out. Green Green is simply that bad! It is the Cthulu of anime. Those that gaze upon it are driven mad!<br />

    This is the only anime I have finished that I&#039;ve given the rating 1. Is this anime worthy of the rating 1? No. There should be a 0. I would give this 0.<br />
<br />
Every single aspect of this anime is a 0. When I started watching this I told myself I&#039;d finish it no matter what because I really wanted to see it through so that I could talk about how bad it truly was. It was physical agony to watch this anime and I kid you not I started looking longingly for my kitchen knife more than once.<br />
<br />
I have never before said anything bad about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15163">
        people watching anime and enjoying different types of anime, but this is so bad I seriously wonder if the people that enjoyed this are watching anime for the right reasons or for any reason at all.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really want to talk about this animes storyboard, screenplay or characters, because as far as I&#039;m concerned, none of this existed in Green Green. This is more of a rant than a review. No. This is a warning.<br />
<br />
Please don&#039;t watch this.<br />
<br />
It really does suck, there can be no opnion about this, this is truly bad and that&#039;s the only right opinion, trust me.

    As a fan and defender of the Harem category, I was truly disappointed in Green Green, this is the type of show that gives Harem-Bashers ammo in their hate-articles and reviews to shows in the category. Shows with ecchi are all fun and games, but Green Green crosses the line on tolerable ecchi so often to the point where the show has become so tasteless that even healthy young men have to shake their heads. To be short and blunt: If you&#039;re desperate for panty shots, lingerie, and huge boobs to the point where you would subject yourself to watch Green Green, then just go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6894">
        to your local video store, I&#039;m sure they have a much better selection there.<br />
<br />
*The only positive to this show is that the girls are wonderfully animated.

    Yesterday, I thought I&#039;d never find an anime that I could deem absolutely unwatchable.<br />
Today, I have been proven wrong.<br />
Green Green is absolutely the worst anime I&#039;ve ever had the misfortune to watch. But enough of my whining, let&#039;s get onto the review.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
It makes me sick. It&#039;s a cliche concept, which is okay.  But their execution absolutely ruins it. When you have a story that can be summed up in 3 episodes at most, but drag it out to 12 there is a serious problem. In fact, there are only 3 episodes that explain ANYTHING! The rest is just a mess of filler.<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
Not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27425">
        bad, not anything to write home about. The character design was rather boring. Some characters just ended up looking like mixes between other characters in the series, and those characters usually looked exactly like something we&#039;ve seen before in other anime. I digress, it&#039;s hardly grounds for complaining though, I could live if everything else was decent.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
It was pretty boring, I didn&#039;t like the opening or the ending all that much. I found them pretty boring, and I didn&#039;t exactly pay attention to background music. I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t spectacular anyway.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
This is the WORST part.<br />
I shall go down the list of characters.<br />
Takasaki Yuuske, the male lead has to be the most boring thing you could EVER spawn. He is way too much of a goodie goodie and all of his dialogue consists of is &quot;Nothing happened, it was an accident, I didn&#039;t do anything!&quot; when he&#039;s put in an awkward situation with Midori or another female character.<br />
Chitose Midori, the female lead and love interest number one.I understand that most girls in harem anime are batshit insane, but I usually don&#039;t expect them to be so creepy and STUPID. Towards the end, I was expecting her to go School Days on Futaba.<br />
Kutsuki Futaba, love interest number two. She&#039;s your average overused archetype of &quot;I HATE MEN JUST BECAUSE&quot; and warms up to Yuuske a lot despite her pointless hatred. I don&#039;t mind this type of character, but I&#039;d at least like a reason for their manhating ways.<br />
The Baka Trio, these guys are the WORST. And this is coming from someone who loves the pervert characters usually. They are just creepy. I don&#039;t remember their names so I&quot;ll just call them what they are. Fat guy is just repulsive, and most of the &#039;jokes&#039; in the series include him in a bra or loincloth. The longhaired guy is pretty forgettable, but he&#039;s my favorite out of the three since he&#039;s just like an average horny teenager. Pedobear is just the worst. He&#039;s a pedophile AND has a food fetish. I don&#039;t mind the lolicon chasing characters in anime usually, but this guy makes me sick.<br />
<br />
The rest are pretty forgettable, there&#039;s another bitch who I can&#039;t really explain without spoiling and your average shy sickly character. And then there&#039;s cactus girl, she&#039;s my favorite because she doesn&#039;t get the opportunity to open her mouth to say something stupid. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
Watching this was about as fun as poking a nerve. The characters suck, the story sucks, the ending sucks and there&#039;s not a single redeeming quality. <br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
This show is abysmal. I usually tell people &quot;Oh, you gotta watch this it&#039;s horrible&quot; when it comes to bad shows but now, I&#039;m telling you like I tell my friends. I care enough about you to tell you to stay far away from Green Green. Unless you&#039;re a bottle of soap or a monkey, then go right ahead, you might get a laugh.

    Green Green TV, a TV series like no other.<br />
However, is this something positive?<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s say, &amp;quot;girl being raped by monkeys&amp;quot; and see how you reply to that.<br />
<br />
Simply put, this Anime is on the verge of being hentai; the only thing it really misses are the scenes with the nudity involved and actual sex scenes. But this one, oh boy, comes &#039;that&#039; close to touching the border never the less.<br />
<br />
It gives you the impression that something is happening; and you know what without even seeing it. Thus, the results are pretty much the same as with Hentai.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, I did not know what to expect of

        this Anime. For starters, I figured it would be one of those comedy/romance type of thingies with a bit of drama at the end. Quite typical, fairly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
But Green Green didn&#039;t even come close to it. Heck, I don&#039;t even get the title of this Anime. Why &#039;green green&#039;, why this, why that. So much useless stuff has been put in; it&#039;s hard to put &#039;what&#039; in order.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to compliment this Anime by saying the sounds were fairly good or bash it any more by saying how bad the story and it&#039;s characters were. Neither am I going to tell you that all characters pretty much are there as a comedic relief and that some of the voices / characters just piss you off. Because really, you should stop reading this review and start searching for a different Anime to watch. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t care about what you pick instead of this, anything is better, seriously.. anything!<br />
<br />
Even though you might have your laughs with this, or you might be sexually fulfilled by this Anime, just pick something else. If you like comedy, watch Tonagura!, Lucky Star, School Rumble, Toradora, Midori no Hibi or whatever. If you want sexual fulfillment by animations; go watch Hentai of some sort.<br />
<br />
BUT DON&#039;T, watch this series.<br />
It&#039;s not even mediocre.<br />
<br />
Simply put, just stay away from this Anime so you won&#039;t regret watching this; because you will eventually after finishing it.<br />
<br />
I hope I just saved at least 12 episodes of your life.

    This anime really seemed like a good one but unfortunately I was proven  wrong.It&#039;s rather fine to watch if you just want to laid back with some comedy(ecchi) 12-episode anime.And also an important fact about it, it&#039;s  an ultra ecchi anime :D.But I have too much gotten into it so I was really disappointed in the end.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I&#039;m not trying to spoil you so it&#039;s a bit hard to describe.It don&#039;t really has an logical plot.A girl comes out of nowhere(past exactly) and claims to know the main male character.So it&#039;s centered how she tries to remember the main character how they&#039;ve been in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1541">
        love a long time ago.But he&#039;s not really into her.I thought that the side stories were way better than the main.It has some harem aspects but not good ones.And the ending is disappointing and clearly rushed  .So I give it just an 3/10.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
It&#039;s nice an steady. I have complains with the character they&#039;re not well designed.But at least the ecchi scenes are nice made and also the funny moments.So 7/10.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I though that this was the best thing .It really has nice opening and ending songs ,:D I could remember them any time and sing yay.I didn&#039;t really heard any good background music.Just didn&#039;t bothered to hear them.So as the best aspect 8/10.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
There are some really cute girls as expected.But doesn&#039;t really gives some new characters girls are shy tomboyish,little sisters,energetic.All seen.And of course it has an teacher with big breasts.And all girls are liking just one boy (so a harem). But there are good ecchi scenes with them so It don&#039;t fails in that point.<br />
Male character:The main male character is just a normal nice guy but he always gets in trouble because of his perverted friends.But despite that his the main harem characters so a great number of girls has a crush on him.Beside him there is a perverted trio(he&#039;s best firends).Because of them the anime is enjoyable.So they&#039;re entertaining us with they&#039;re perverted ideas.So all in all there aren&#039;t any unique character, always the same.They didn&#039;t have any developments.But they&#039;re acceptable (they didn&#039;t go on my nerves) 6/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Well I did enjoy it to a certain moment (last two eps.).All in all it was funny and ecchi.But I did already mentioned it has a way too poor ending so I was disappointed(I&#039;m always getting back at this and note it).5/10<br />
<br />
Maybe I gave it a too high score but it was long time  ago so I didn&#039;t really thought over it :D.

    When I think to myself, &quot;What is the worst anime ever made?&quot; several titles come to mind. Shows like Big Order, Mars of Destruction and Genocyber, as well as the recent catastrophe, Hand Shakers, may be awoken in your subconscious, but, there is an evil that lurks within the recesses of my mind. A show that I have blocked out for years; placed a barrier in front of my eyes from ever thinking about again. I have attempted to repress this title countless times in my head, but, alas, each time I have been completely fruitless in my actions. This terrible piece of entertainment, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247390">
        known as only one colour; and, how appropriate that this colour is the one associated with puke. This ladies and gentlemen is Green Green!<br />
<br />
Aside from winning the award for the laziest title name ever, Green Green is a show from the early 2000s and it hasn&#039;t aged well in the slightest! Like many other shows of that time, the harem genre was taking effect and it seemed that everyone began to jump on the gravy-filled bandwagon and the result, is something truly horrifying. While this show, just from the pictures present here on MAL, may seem like your typical harem with the main aim being fan service, I assure you, what lurks underneath is an unspeakable piece of garbage that has transcended the very realms of humanity itself! Okay, I may be relying a little too much on hyperbolic language here, but one of the reasons why I hate this show, despite the numerous other reasons to hate it that I&#039;ll get into in a moment, is that Green Green was amongst my first few anime that I ever watched at the beginning of my anime watching career at the end of 2011. Here I am, optimistic and ignorant to the idea of a terrible anime, when BOOM!, like a hit to the nuts, here comes this vile piece of faeces to completely mentally scare me. But, I&#039;ve stalled for too long. Unfortunately, I must dive into why this anime is so horrible!<br />
<br />
The original product of Green Green was, in fact, an eroge, but the show completely omits all of the sex scenes and leaves us with nothing. Why did they think this was a good idea? Eroge are not exactly known for having great narratives or anything, aside from a few series I can think of from the top of my head, and God, do the barebones story ever show when you remove the only thing that would keep people interested in the first place. Essentially, some random all-boys school in the middle of nowhere is greeted by a bunch of girls from an all-girl school, as they both live with each other for a month as a social experiment of some kind set up by both respective schools, while the boys try and get into the girl&#039;s underwear. That&#039;s it! The rest of the show is essentially just a bunch of painfully unfunny and awkward jokes while the female characters are forced to remove as much clothing as possible in the most insulting of ways while the writers attempt, ATTEMPT to build up relationships between these characters but it just falls flat on its face. <br />
<br />
Aside from the lack of any plot, the characters are just as bad, if not, worse in many regards and aspects. The main character, Yuuskue, is about as entertaining as watching paint dry, actually, no, scrap that. That&#039;s an insult to paint drying on a wall! Not only is he given the most bland, cookie-cutter design, but his involvement in the story is as strong as Steven Hawkins in a boxing match. For a character the show seems to be trying to push as someone we should feel empathy towards, it&#039;s kind of hard to do when he has nothing to care about. He has no charisma, no personality, and yet, all of the girls still harbour crushes for this damn guy! He clearly is nothing else but a bland self-insert for all of the filthy weebs to latch onto and thus, they made his personality as bare bones as possible in order to achieve this. Screwit. Even though this anime is not adapted from a light novel, I am dubbing this guy &quot;Light Novel Empowerment Guy&quot; for the remainder of this review since his character reminds me so much of your typical light novel narrative. Anyway, Light Novel Empowerment Guy, somehow, manages to win the affection of every girl he encounters on his journey, through his amazing power of dullness, including the main love interest of the series, a girl named Chitose Midori. I bet the writer felt REAL smart using Chitose&#039;s last name, which means Green. Round of applause; originality is dead with this show!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Chitose is completely in love with him from the offset, and we actually learn, and I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m about to say this, that both Light Novel Empowerment Guy and Chitose were both lovers in a previous life and are reincarnations of those very same people! When I first watched this, I slammed my head on the desk from such a stupid plot twist. Not only was there no mention of the supernatural at all up to this point, aside from REALLY vague pieces of dialogue, but it comes across as so stupid and badly written. And guess what! Light Novel Empowerment Guy is still JUST as boring as was before! I don&#039;t care if he a reincarnation or whatever! In fact, now he is even duller since he behaved exactly like this, but in a previous life! Double the dullness for you! Anyway, Light Novel Empowerment Guy&#039;s and Chisote&#039;s relationship feels completely tacked-on and lifeless, not to mention superficial. It doesn&#039;t grow during the course of the series, we don&#039;t really understand why these two love each other aside from the fact that the script tells them to do so, and after Light Novel Empowerment Guy remembers his past, he falls in love with her straight away, erasing any development the characters may of had.<br />
<br />
The show tries to develop Light Novel Empowerment Guy&#039;s relationships with the other girls, and while there is a little development between him and a girl called Futaba, nothing, in the end, feels satisfying or plays off in an interesting way. Each girl is clearly there to full-fill a certain archetype. We have the one with the big boobs, the loli character, the eccentric character and the Tsundere. They attempt to mask this by giving each girl some oddly specific personality trait, but just like Hand Shakers, this doesn&#039;t make a character interesting, in fact, it only further highlights how terrible the writing is. One girl has a strange obsession with a cactus; another likes horror stuff. That&#039;s it. Give every award to Green Green because CLEARLY nothing else will ever compete with this level of writing.<br />
<br />
Now, at this point, the show doesn&#039;t sound as bad as I had described it to be in the opening paragraphs, but I haven&#039;t gotten to the parts I hate yet. That honour goes to the TERRIBLE comedy and the worst trio I have ever seen! Each joke is centred around three complete idiots and I HATED these characters. Never before have I been so repulsed and annoyed at three fictional characters before, but these guys, aside from being completely obnoxious, are also complete damn creeps who attempt to sexually harass the girls in an attempt to have their way with them. They&#039;re essentially three pervert male characters, all of which consistently break the law and do just some plain creepy stuff! One of these three has a complete obsession with little sisters and attempts to have his way with a girl who looks no older than ten-years-old. Not only does he sneak into her room at night and sleep next to her, but, for some reason, also brings a bowl and some rice and, well...decides to eat rice next to her sleeping body while crying to himself in regards to how cute she is. If this sounded insane, that&#039;s because it is, and the anime expects us to laugh at this crap! I spent more time being freaked out if anything else! And this scenario I just explained to you is one of the more tamer ones! They get much worse! One scene, for instance, features the trio stuck inside a sauna of some sorts, as they become hotter and hotter and, because of the lack of water, become more disillusioned. They imagine that each one the guys is a girl they like and begin to touch each other sexually! When I first watched this scene I turned it off straight away and had a long, cold shower to reevaluate all of my life up to that point.<br />
<br />
At one point, they decide to use a fishing rod to forcibly remove a girl&#039;s top, revealing her bare breasts; another time they are, no joke, raped by a bear while out in the woods, and they&#039;re constantly tearing off their clothes in the presence of women. I mean, I know that puberty makes everyone become a bit more, &quot;excited&quot;, let&#039;s put it, but these guys are pretty much all sex offenders, and it&#039;s just the fact that the show thinks this is comedic is what makes me hate this show as much as I do. It&#039;s disgusting, as low brow as you could possibly go and is wrong on so many levels that I can&#039;t even explain all of the events. I would tell you to check it out for yourselves since the only way to know of the horrors this show entails is to see it yourself but I would never wish this upon another human being. The show is clearly aiming at being an ecchi, but, even then, it fails in that regard. The girls themselves aren&#039;t all that appealing in character designs and looks and, if you&#039;re watching an anime for such a reason, there are so many better alternatives, even other shows that aired in the same season such as Ikkitousen. Sure, Ikkitousen is also trash, but, at the very least, works as an eechi anime and doesn&#039;t take itself seriously.<br />
<br />
The animation and art design is AWFUL; everything looks so bland and washed out. As the title suggests, there sure is a lot of Green, so much so, that the shots of the hills and grass have burnt a permanent image into my retinas forever. The character designs are dull and lack any originality and the animation is the most bare-bones and cheap you could imagine. Characters barely move, and when they do, the movement feels clunky. They did manage to get the boob jiggles right, because, clearly, that is the most important aspect of this show. The music is also terrible. The opening is a super obnoxious J-Pop song that doesn&#039;t have any right to be so upbeat for such a boring show, and you can gauge the quality of this trash just from the opening alone. It&#039;s essentially just a mouse cursor that hovers over the girl&#039;s naked bodies and clothes materialize out of thin air. I have to wonder, however. For some reason, when the girls are equipped with a bra, their breasts bounce even more than before, even though a bras main function, at least to my knowledge, is to keep the goods in place. I know I&#039;m looking into this way too deep but when a show offers you this little intellectual stimulation, your mind wanders over to such things. <br />
<br />
FUN FACT! This show actually did get a hentai OVA release, and just like the show, it is one of the worst hentai ever made. It&#039;s pretty bare bones in terms of the sex scenes and there is even a lesbian scene, but all of this is ruined by the fact that we have the trio, now personified as monkeys, jerking off whilst watching Light Novel Empowerment Guy and Chitose having sex. It&#039;s creepy and this OVA adds nothing more to the characters or story, in fact, it regresses everything.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this anime is awful in every sense of the word. While not as technically broken as something like Hand Shakers, the sheer amount of strange, gross and uncomfortable scenes made me feel sick and combine that with a completely boring and linear narrative with some terrible excuse of reincarnation makes for a terrible ride. Avoid this garbage like the plague.

    Have you ever watched an ecchi anime, and said it couldn&#039;t be better then this? Well here&#039;s one for you. The crazy plot of two separated lovers who meet again in a different time, keeps problems coming in this hilarious mix of romance and comedy. In the nudity department, this anime does not fail, sometimes I actually wished the girls would put on some damn clothes already (Yeah that much nudity)! Plus the romance in here is pretty epic. I came into the series, looking for some funny ecchi stuff, but came out with a fairly good love/romance.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really give this series a rating,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13691">
        mostly because there is no defined genre, but the series is really great. BUT, DO NOT WATCH THE OVA, it sucks.

    After few consideration, I&#039;ve decided to change my review about this anime. I know many peoples that has read my old review about this anime will say:<br />
&#039;So this person actually change his review about this anime just because no peoples think that his old review is helpful, lol&#039;<br />
To be honest, this reason is, well, correct. But this is only half true, though. For this new version of Green Green anime review, I will not change the way I think about this anime before. You know, this anime sucks. I will only changes the way how I think about this anime.<br />
~STORY~<br />
It is a very peaceful and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1022">
        boring day in the all boys school wrapped in the beautiful nature environment. The boys in this school rarely see any girls at all, until that...Oh gosh! A bunch of girls is coming to our school! Yay! And so, a bunch of guys starting to have weird fantasies in their virgin mind. As expected from anime that adapted from an eroge (or H-game, Japanese peoples prefer to call it that way).Well after you guys read my prologue, maybe you guys will think that:<br />
Wow! I love harem! Then this is definitely an anime suitable for me! Don&#039;t call it sucks man! (..........silent..........)<br />
Wait. Same as you guys, I also really loves harem. And I&#039;m thinking exactly same ways too, in the beginning, though.  Well I can&#039;t denies that they have their own creativity to the story in this anime (romance part in it). I&#039;ve quite enjoyed it. But, this anime got some fatal flaws in it. Not-so-Ordinary Fetishism are slipped inside this anime.  This is the examples by the way:<br />
Because of his curiosity of the girls feeling having their n*pple played, a guy decided to have his friends played his own n*pple played using a paint brush. And he moaned like a girl having his n*pple played after that. That&#039;s quite gay. I dare not to tells anymore spoiler, considering the rules. <br />
They got many more Not-so-Ordinary Fetishism inside it, so some male watchers may not able to accept it. All right I&#039;ll tell you guys one more spoilers:<br />
That guys get f*ck*ed by a male bear...worst, moaning sound and squishing sound can be heard (you know what i mean). Enough of the story, now lets go to another section. Read on.<br />
~ART~<br />
The art is quite good. I can says about that. The animation is great, no complaint about that. But the background of the animation is quite static. I can say that the background is dead. The animation is hardly combined with it&#039;s background. If you don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about, try to compare it to another anime background. You will find the different in it.Oh, and the tear effects sucks. Not suitable at all.<br />
~SOUND~<br />
Yes the sound is great, seiryuu is great, opening and closing song is just OK. I can accepts it without any problems. This is what can i say about this section. I sucks in this section you see... Hardly to review it. But I thinks that everyone can accept it. So I&#039;ve decided to rate the sound in this anime as good.<br />
~CHARACTER~<br />
Sucks. Gay fetishism. Only for side characters though. It is not really fair to mix the gayish side character with the main character. Yep. Other than side characters, the main character is decent enough. The female characters in this anime is also decent, they are cute and got some personal attitude with them. But, some male watchers will definitely disappointed with the body cutting of some cute female characters in this anime. They deserve more in their body cutting. I hope you know what I mean. But that is not the reasons why I put the poor rating in this section. The main reason is, you know, I hate gay.<br />
~ENJOYMENT~<br />
5/10. This is all I can say about this anime. I can&#039;t really enjoys it. I have to skip through the scenes that I can&#039;t accept. So it&#039;s quite annoying. I can really just put 5 on it. Screw the side characters. I really enjoys the main storyline.<br />
~OVERALL~<br />
At last! I&#039;ve spend about 1 and half hour to write this review! OK, If this anime doesn&#039;t have fatal flaw in them, I will definitely give the 7 on it without hesitate. Sadly, they put some jokes that I can&#039;t even accept. So -2 for them. Thanks to spend your precious times to read my bad review. Sorry if any of my words has offended you. One last word, I&#039;ve warned you about this anime and you can watch it with your own discretion. And, don&#039;t let your parents see that you watch this anime if you are under 18 or at least, errr, 16 because this anime got many nutidy scenes in it. Thanks for reading! <br />

    The mixed reviews here are so polarised! Never has an anime generated so many negative reviews! So much that I felt compelled to shed some light on it:<br />
<br />
WHAT IS GREEN GREEN ABOUT ANYWAY?<br />
Answer: exactly what it says on the box -<br />
1) Slice-of-life at a boarding school<br />
2) Comedy (the like of American Pie - adolescents trying to get laid)<br />
3) Romance and ecchi (nudity)<br />
<br />
WHY PEOPLE HATE IT?<br />
1) The anime has no plot. No it doesn&#039;t. Girls think boys are disgusting and unromantic loosers v/s boys try to get laid and/or find love. If you don&#039;t like slice-of-life then back off it&#039;s not for you.<br />
<br />
2) The &quot;Harem-ness&quot; is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54511">
        deceiving. Despite what people says this is not an Harem of the like of Clannad, Air or Kanon, where one self-centred clueless idiot is invaded somehow by an unrealistic mob of female beauties and he has no clue what to do. First Green Green is a Slice-of-life, NOT AN HAREM - the airing time is divided among multiple characters, each of which different and evolves in different manners. Secondly the male leads in Green Green waste no time speculating nonesense but from the onset try to bed any girl they can get (including their teacher!). Thirdly at least 5 female characters emerged out of the crowd as leads in their own rights and they don&#039;t all go for the same man - they have different personalities and agendas.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Ecchi-ness&quot; - Yes it is ecchi but don&#039;t expect all girls to have D-size cups. Unlike conventional ecchi, the female bodies in there vary. Nudity occurs within a certain context (erotic-like e.g. in the bath) and not overtly unnecessarily (porn-like e.g. unnecessary pantyshots and bubbling boobs every 2 sec etc or girl got hit and her clothing falls apart!). Remember Ranma 1/2? So align your expectations accordingly! It is ecchi but might not be ecchi enough for you. On the other hand it is ecchi enough to disgust you if you don&#039;t like nudity or crude jokes in the first place!<br />
<br />
4) It&#039;s gross. Yes it is. It&#039;s crude, and the jokes have sexual connotations. If you like only stuffs like Shugo Chara or Pokemon forget it, I suggest you navigate away instead of leaving bad comments!<br />
<br />
POINTS WORTH MENTIONING:<br />
1) Comedy. Sick humour Austin Powers&#039; style within a school setting, not to everybody&#039;s liking but incredibly silly and FUNNY if you don&#039;t hate crude humour!<br />
2) Character development. Yes although the boys pricipally differ in their degreee of perversity, the girls do have distinct personalities.<br />
3) Although I said there&#039;s basically no plotline, there is the development of a romantic plot over the course of time.<br />
<br />
PERSONAL COMMENTS:<br />
This is school-context slice-of-life, the only reason people hates it it&#039;s because they either don&#039;t even like slice-of-life in the first place or they have an issue with the &quot;ecchi&quot;-ness of Green Green - it&#039;s either too much or too little for their taste!

    Rumour has it that Green Green is one of the  anime that you&#039;ll receive as an answer on agenda of &quot;looking for a good, funny ecchi anime&quot;. I must have been hearing some incredibly wrong rumours because Green Green has about as much to do with funny as night has to do with the day - it can try to be funny, but it never will be. Nor entirely sexy, nor entirely logical. It is the worst piece of ecchi anime that we ever had the shame of witnessing on Earth and at this point as I&#039;m editing this at the end of 2017,

    Green Green is one of my favorite anime. It really is funny, and it&#039;s a pretty good story too. Let&#039;s start with the story.<br />
<br />
In the beginning I was a little confused, but after a few episodes it all fits well. I thought it was a rather good story so I gave it an 8.<br />
<br />
The art wasn&#039;t bad. Sometimes there were some unrealistic moves (like swimming) but it was not bad. I gave it a 7.<br />
<br />
Sound was great. The voice actors who were chosen were a perfect match with the characters. Midori&#039;s voice was cute, and Yuusuke&#039;s voice was also pretty good. An 9 for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1267">
        sound.<br />
<br />
The characters were really great! Just because they were so funny. Like Yuusuke&#039;s friends, who are really perverted. I enjoyed myself. A 10 for the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment was good. Every episode I was laughing. The humor was really great! Also a perfect score for the enjoyment, a 10.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really a funny serie, and you should watch it when you had enough of all the shitty fight/action series. It never bores you, and I gave it a 9!

    Green Green is an anime based off of an H-game. It aired in 2003 and was handled by Studio Matrix. If you haven&#039;t heard of Matrix, it&#039;s probably because they were a studio responsible for all of four anime and none of them seem to be well regarded. I was asked to review this by someone who said it&#039;s one of the worst anime he&#039;s ever seen. So, let&#039;s dive into it. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Basically, our story is set in a boy&#039;s school that&#039;s going to spend a month going co-ed as a test run. Our protagonist, Yusuke, finds himself in an especially awkward situation when he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366361">
        gets glomped by a girl he&#039;s never met who claims she&#039;s been looking for him for a long time. <br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the core problem with the narrative. We&#039;re meant to believe that Yusuke and Midori were lovers in another life, but their love was forbidden and now it&#039;s carrying some kind of curse. But we&#039;re never given any reason for it being forbidden or any rationale behind the curse whatsoever. Which is weird because that&#039;s the core premise of the series. How shit do you have to be as a writer to not bother fleshing out your core premise to that degree? Seriously, all they have to do is tell us they were from feuding families or one of them was nobility and the other poor. And even doing that much is just beyond them. Another issue is that the romance itself is just poorly written and not well developed. <br />
<br />
That being said, the biggest problem with the series is the comedy. The main &quot;humour&quot; for this series stems from Yusuke&#039;s three best friends sexually harassing the girls in egregious and downright vile ways. And when I say that, I mean that peeping is the least of their offences. These guys sneak into the girls&#039; dorms at night and crawl into bed with girls who are already sleeping. They forcibly strip a girl at one point and they do all sorts of other shit that should easily get them arrested but the series plays it like it&#039;s all just harmless shenanigans and they&#039;re really good guys at heart. Which is just gross and uncomfortable. Only an Incel would find these guys tolerable. You also get such anti-comedy as a man getting raped by a bear and a woman getting molested by monkeys. Because class is for other anime.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters in this are pretty obnoxious. The women are basically right out of a bad harem work. The main protagonist is meant to be the boring everyman sort, but with the kind of friends you would only have if you were a terrible person. And that brings us to the worst characters, the sexual assault trio. They&#039;re consistently horrible, in your face and annoying. Easily among the worst characters in any comedy ever made. About the only character in this that&#039;s passable is the cactus. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The character designs are a bit generic. There&#039;s far too much fan-service. The backgrounds are lazy. There are zero good visual gags. Less than zero if you dock points for every bad visual gag. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
This has some actors I really respect. Ueda Kana and Hamada Kenji are both fine actors with some strong roles behind them, for example. But the acting in this is awful. It&#039;s all very exaggerated. Very annoying. No subtlety, nuance or skill on display. The music is kind of bad, but less bad than any other element of the series. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a gay joke involving Yusuke&#039;s horrible friends getting locked into a hot room. There&#039;s also a moment towards the end where a bunch of girls confess romantic feelings to Reika. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. If you want your characters to come across as &quot;lovable scamps&quot; you can&#039;t have them be this irredeemably horrible. Even if you are solely trying to appeal to Incels. <br />
<br />
2. If you want a convoluted romance involving time travel, reincarnation and forbidden, cursed love, you need to explain the situation to the audience. Giving us ten seconds at the start of every episode saying that the leads had a forbidden love just leaves a lot of questions like &quot;why?&quot; or &quot;what happened exactly?&quot; And if you don&#039;t want to provide even a cursory explanation, maybe take another route. <br />
<br />
3. A lot of the tension for a series like this involves attachment to the characters. Which means you shouldn&#039;t have a bunch of rubbish characters with virtually no personality. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Green Green is the worst comedy I&#039;ve seen since I watched Sunabouzu. The attempts at comedy are rubbish. The characters are horrible and obnoxious, the plot is a bunch of nonsense the acting and art are both badly done. It just has nothing to recommend it unless you&#039;re an Incel and you can really relate to being egregiously creepy around women for no good reason. I&#039;m rating this one at a 1/10.

    Holy fucking shit. I have never seen such an atrocity in animation in my life. I saw Boku, and ladies and gentlemen I dare say that this is worse than Boku no Pico. I can state this with confidence because Boku had some semblance of a target audience. The shotacon demographic is large enough that significant funds would be earned off of creating such a thing for such individuals even though it is not my cup of tea. Green Green on the other hand is comparable to the act of shoving a human corpse into another and another and another until you have just created

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104943">
        a festering mess of wasted decaying human flesh. <br />
<br />
I shall first talk about the story. So Kira Jesus Yamato (Yuusuke-kun) has some slut girlfriend from the future that is a Deus Ex Machina of the highest order. Her voice sounds as if fire had been lit at a farm designed for producing livestock. Anyways, Kira dies and since there&#039;s no Athrun to save him, Deus Ex Machina has to give up all her life force and die. So she does this and she doesn&#039;t die. Then she has to go back to the future so that Kira can fuck that one girl with the purple hair and they can make tiny Gendum children to go out and fight the evils of Nihongo for truth and justice. If that doesn&#039;t make sense to you, I say it&#039;s because my head hurts  so much from the end of that anime but this show was Green Green so I&#039;ll just assume that my assumption that this truly is what I just witnissed is 100% accurate<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the art. The art is the best thing about this show. The amount of times I have seen a face model that has made me laugh to the point of near asphyxiation is astounding. The art is so bad that if you were to present it at its worst to a kindergarten teacher that teacher would brutally murder the child you deemed responsible.<br />
<br />
Now the sound. It sounds like random elevator music. I can&#039;t complain nor does it leave an impact on me.<br />
<br />
And now the pièce de résistance, the characters. Holy fucking shit. Holy fucking shit. Holy fucking shit. The characters in this show. Holy fucking shit. What? Holy fucking shit. Ok, so anyways there&#039;s this generic protagonist guy but you don&#039;t need to worry about him because he&#039;s overshadowed by 3 of the most vile  (vl)<br />
adj. vil·er, vil·est<br />
1. Loathsome; disgusting: vile language.<br />
2. Unpleasant or objectionable: vile weather. See Synonyms at offensive.<br />
3.<br />
a. Contemptibly low in worth or account; second-rate.<br />
b. Of mean or low condition.<br />
4. Miserably poor and degrading; wretched: a vile existence.<br />
5. Morally depraved; ignoble or wicked: a vile conspiracy.<br />
characters in anime history. Seriously, I dare you to put up with them for one episode and tell me you don&#039;t have an urge to kill yourself.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the enjoyment. This show is devoid of it all except for one thing. This one thing has more personality, social skill, affinity with the bitches, and redeeming qualities than any other character in this show. What am I talking about you might ask? I&#039;m not certain myself. I&#039;m just so confused as to how a fucking piece of agricultural development can outshine an entire cast of an anime that aired for 12 episodes. Like Jesus H Christ, I understand why the owner of the cactus is so madly in love with him. It&#039;s because he is the equivalent of the second coming of the messiah compared to the rest of these shit eaters. Togemura is a manly ass name and this cactus, this motherfucking cactus exceeds the name he has been given. He deserves a new name; a name that every man woman and child can hear and think &quot;I want this person to carry the flag of humanity if we are somehow all forced to near extinction.&quot; Thus from this day forward the Cactus hailing from Green Green shall now be known as &quot;Fuck Studio Matrix&quot;<br />
<br />
 The fact that we have produced such an abomination that it dwarfs every other tragedy to befall our planet is revolting. This anime gets a -5/10 for marking itself as the darkest time in my adult life. Stay away from this. You will have a chance at a glorious future and will likely grow to be a successful and optimistic individual. God fucking Speed. Stay fucking frosty. ~From IV

    Ugh, oh dear! So i am only half way through this anime but i felt compelled to write this review. Now let me go on record by saying that normally i love comedy and ecchi anime. I looked Green Green up as a time filler, something to watch that needs little concentration but fills some time, this is exactly what i got, a time filler that requires the IQ and concentration span of a goldfish to enjoy. Allow me to highlight this in more detail!<br />
<br />
Story: There is very little i can say on this, the story is centered around an all boys school full of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25393">
        very depraved students who have clearly never seen a female before. Now where i understand this is necessary for the comedy element in this series, it is pulled off to a degree that comes across as just creepy and in parts disturbing. Somewhere in the wreckage there is supposedly a side story of an old love between 2 students, but don&#039;t be suckered into thinking that there is any depth to this anime, there is not!<br />
<br />
I am going to skip the art and sound part of this review, for the best part they are perfectly fine and as such are uninteresting to talk about.<br />
<br />
Characters: Now this is where the bulk of the train wreck lies. The story is just basically about perversion, as a result the only thing you will discover about the characters is that they are perverted. Apparently the love story involved with this anime is between the male lead character and one of the female students! however he doesn&#039;t seem to remember her. The only thing i took from this situation is that the female is extremely annoying and highly obsessed with him. It&#039;s impossible to identify with any of the characters, so as far as enjoyment goes i would rather chew broken glass.<br />
<br />
The only thing preventing me from dropping this anime is the hope that maybe towards the end this series might prove me wrong!<br />
<br />
To finish, this anime is just not worth it, i am struggling to get through individual episodes as it is, to make matters worse it has special episodes as well.

    Green Green is…….oh boy. Green Green is an anime that was based off of a supposedly pornographic visual novel. I&#039;ve never played the visual novel for myself, so I’ll have to take people’s word for it. Green Green was something one of my friends told me about. He told me that I should review it because of how bad it was. Is it really that bad though?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The “plot” of this series revolves around Yusuke, &amp; his “friends” which consist of 3 idiotic perverts who only have sex on the mind living at an all male boarding house (though it’s only all male for a few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329734">
        minutes at most). A school bus carrying a bunch of girls, who were pretty much made to transfer against their will, then arrives at the academy, we then meet midori, a girl that apparently knows Yusuke because she comes from the future in an alternate timeline. Shenanigans ensue, nothing really matters until the last 2 episodes, the end.<br />
<br />
Where do I even begin? Well, for starters, absolutely nothing happens. Nothing that would move the plot along anyway. For the first episode, we get “set-up” for what’s “in-store” for us in the following episodes to come. The problem is, nothing but shenanigans are in store for us until episode 10, which is when this anime remembers that it has a plot it’s supposed to tell. The second problem, the story explains absolutely nothing. We aren’t given a single god-damn detail about what the story is supposed to be about until the final 2 episodes. But by then it’s too late, as anybody with sanity (which isn’t myself unfortunately) would’ve dropped this show and moved.<br />
<br />
Now onto the “comedy” of this series. The comedy in this series is the same juvenile, loud, random, &amp; obnoxious humor that you would expect to find in just about any ecchi-fanservice anime. But the absolute pants on top of this shit sundae is just how creepy some of these “jokes” become. We not only see one of the 3 perverts sleep next to his “kid sister”, eat food next to her, &amp; then get in a how should I say, peculiar position. But we also get to see the guys having incredibly putrid fantasies of some of the girls on campus. So the humor isn’t only juvenile &amp; toilet, but it’s also outright creepy, what a combination.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Yusuke is the straight man, and pretty much nothing else. Yusuke is probably the least irritating of the characters in this show, I really can’t get too riled up at a nobody who doesn’t see a lick of development throughout the entire 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
Futaba is a strong girl, as well as the only other sane person in this anime. I can’t really get mad at her either, especially seeing as she beats up the idiotic perverts, which is incredibly satisfying might I add.<br />
<br />
Next on our list is Midori. Midori is only defined as being hopelessly obsessed with Yusuke. She’s also supposed to be some girl from the future, but the anime doesn’t bother explaining a damn-thing about that.<br />
<br />
Next on our list are the 3 little perverts. I’m lumping these 3 together because they’re practically the same character, they might as well have just been the same drawing with different clothes trying to mask the fact, lord knows it would certainly fit with how incredibly lazy everything about this anime is.<br />
<br />
Yet another big problem with this anime is just how lacking &amp; flat all these characters are. They’re pretty much only defined by one character trait &amp; nothing else. Which could work given that this series is a “comedy” &amp; as long as the characters provide a good comedic dynamic between each other, everything should be fine. But as I pointed out earlier, the comedy in this series is juvenile &amp; creepy, so you’ve already failed on the comedy by itself, so by that point, you wouldn’t even know how to create good character dynamics if you failed at the basic comedy. The characters also see 0 development throughout the entire run-time of this anime. There are moments that may seem like some development is going to take place, but after those moments, things pretty much go back to the way they were. Which makes the whole thing frustrating above all else.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork on display here is absolutely atrocious, the backgrounds are lazy &amp; repetitive, the character designs are hideous, the colors are drab, &amp; the overall world design looks incredibly basic. The animation on the other hand, is ridiculously lazy. They took every corner cutting technique you could imagine, shots that don’t show the characters mouths to get away with not having to animate the lips (which would’ve looked like shit anyway), reused animation, sliding still images across the screen, literally being still images, 0 detail, if there’s a corner cutting technique that I haven’t mentioned, I can guarantee you this show took it. The cinematography is just as lazy as the animation is. Flat &amp; lifeless shots panning over still images, what masterful directing you have Green Green!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The voice acting is atrocious, the comedy is incredibly over-acted, the characters are either yelling almost all the time, or they’re in such a monotone voice that makes it sound like the voice actors were so invested in their role. I watched both the English Dub &amp; original Japanese Audio, they’re equally horrendous as one another, but at least the Japanese side could actually pronounce the names of the characters correctly, so that makes it win by default.<br />
<br />
The music honestly isn’t bad, it’s nothing special, but I feel like this would’ve been a decent OST had it been used in a different show. Als, this is green green we’re talking about, so the OST is just a barely (actually, no, not even barely) salvageable piece out of this shitty shitty anime.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts/Overall<br />
<br />
Do I even need to say it at this point? Green Green gets a 1/10, there is absolutely nothing positive here. The story is on pause for 98% of the runtime, &amp; when it does decide to rear its head, it’s so poorly explained. The animation is ridiculously lazy, the art is atrocious, the voice acting is atrocious, the characters are flat caricatures, there’s nothing here. I now fully understand why the friend who told me I should take a look at this warned me at the last second as to why I should’ve reconsidered. I’m quite honestly ashamed of myself for watching this past the first episode, and this is coming from a man who watched Dark Cat &amp; Sword for Truth TWICE! Do I even need to say it? Don’t watch this anime please. This isn’t even funny bad, it won’t even give you a new appreciation for any of your favorites, this anime is just outright horrible in every conceivable way. Is this worse than Kennel Tokorozawa though? By technicality yes, but I would say no. See, I at least got some laughs out of how lazily made this show was, I didn’t laugh once throughout Kennel, Green Green also didn’t create a dog character that I ended up hating either. Regardless though, Green Green is utter crap, and I implore you all to heed my advice &amp; stay away from this monstrosity. <br />

    This anime tends to receive a lot of flack from the public and anime lovers in general. It has flat stereotyped characters, a story that doesn&#039;t really move much after the first few episodes (and then till the last few episodes), and a very &quot;paper&quot; romance structure.  This is a fair judgement and is done rightly so.  I preface this review by saying that this anime is terrible/generic and I know it.<br />
<br />
That being said, I strangely liked this anime personally. Despite its many obvious cons, I got into the love story and fanaticism of the lead female&#039;s (Midori) love for Yusuke. I also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173301">
        really liked Futaba and started to wage internal war over which girl I hoped Yusuke would go for. (Guys, take notes to Yusuke&#039;s act of chivalry to protect a girl&#039;s honor/modesty in an early episode. It worked well in his favor love-wise and it was totally the right thing to do. Kudos to gentlemen!)<br />
<br />
Futaba was probably the character that developed the most as the series went on. She started as a stereotyped &quot;tough girl&quot; caricature and eventually became a very sensitive/shy nice person. I found myself performing a &quot;180&quot; on disliking her character....to loving it to death. Besides her and Midori, I found the other girls just there to take up space/add to the overall cast.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t watched a ton of anime, and that may be the reason I liked it but.....it felt like a summer camp to me. I bonded with the characters (despite how annoying/stereotyped most all of them are) and was sad as it drew to a close. Without spoiling anything, the ending of this series is VERY VERY disappointing and UNfulfilling if you do not go and locate the extra episode 13 (Erolutions) which caps the series off and puts a romantic &quot;ease&quot;/closure to one such as myself. I was really upset and confused until I learned of the final episode so....if you do get invested in this show, I&#039;d recommend you find it (the series went from beyond depressing to very satisfying with the conclusion reached between the end of 12 and the end of 13).<br />
<br />
The art and sound of the show isn&#039;t anything to write home about (though the opening theme song can be very catchy).<br />
<br />
Anyways, the setting was good, the girls were cute, the main character was decently honorable (until his less-than-ideal move in episode 13), and I even grew to be ok/amused with the Baka Trio (Hikaru Ichiban-Boshi being the most amusing as I liked/related to his romantic traits) by the end.<br />
<br />
In the end, the ultimate pro of the show is the love triangle between the main characters.  The cons.....almost everything else.  I give this anime a &quot;9&quot; because of my own personal bond/enjoyment of it, but in reality, it deserves a &quot;3&quot; overall when I step back.<br />
<br />
Though most would disagree with me, I&#039;d love to see a Green Green 2 that expands on Yusuke&#039;s relationship with his &quot;significant other.&quot; However, I&#039;m content with where the series ended.

    Review may contain minor spoilers(but in fact it can`t be spoiled more).<br />
<br />
Nowadays general approach to themes about sexuality and porn is very loose among many people. However not mine, because I am sick and tired of seeing sexual undertones everytime, everywhere in everything. Nevertheless I am not a puritan since I like acts of naked women as long as it has artsy feeling or symbolical meaning. Unfortunately, Green Green has neither of those...<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
The development of story is non-existent. It started unbearably repetitious and ended the same way. Everything so-called &quot;story&quot; in this anime is just an excuse to some perverted, non-funny jokes and cliches.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32711">
        In the end the plot tries so hard to be something little more, but only manges to making this show even more ridiculously pathetic.<br />
<br />
This is labeled as an comedy by plenty of watchers. Well, maybe i am too serious, but all the jokes seems to me not appealing. The main topic of jokes ranging widely from sex to sex. There are even jokes about jerking off or being raped by bear in the forest. To addition, you can come across some fetish or monkeys doing nasty things to girls. Disgusting as much as you can imagine.<br />
<br />
The worst thing is a boredom of the show. Due to lack off development of plot you can find yoursefl fast really fed up with unnecessary fillers thrown here and there. The main story could be focused and shown in about 2 or 3 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 2<br />
<br />
Art is incredibly bad. Characters are build of disproported bodies and large breast(you know, the most important thing in this anime). Graphically show is made goldbrick, especially everything beside the breasts. Animation sucks. It has made me nauseous all the time i am watching it, notwithstanding it is the second best part of this show.<br />
<br />
Opening is unworthy mentiong, ending is plain boring and useless.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
It is not that unspeakably repugnant like the rest. Some of the melodies are abrasively mixed up sounds. In the last two episodes you can hear some piano notes in the background, although they are very basic. To your astonishment there are even strings of volin in the last episode. Tracks from OP and ED are just bad and forgettable.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Seiyū you can distinguish two gropus: the indifferent ones and the annoying one. The worst of all is Midori. I just can`t put up with her. You feel as though you are listening to some brain-dead thirteen. Yuck.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
<br />
In this case charactes are... Wait a second, they could not be called characters. They are bunch of repetitive figures without soul and without any development.<br />
<br />
Yusueke - the protagonist, the clumsy failure of boy. He has got a heart made of gold and is a personification of goodie goodie. Guy is there for getting bashed for perverted thing done by his firends, in which he takes part by accident. All he can say is something like &quot;It is 	coincidence!&quot;. <br />
Chitose Midori - the brain-dead and very friendly girl. Fiercely stupid and irreparably beloved in Yusueke. Most irritating figure from the girls` group.<br />
Kutsuki Futaba - I hate men, i hate them. Reasons? None. Tsundere archetype. Taking every character in consideration she is not that bad, she gives some variation to blatant character cast.<br />
The Baka Trio - unimaginably repulsive, disgusting and abominable perverted guys. I hate them. They are not funny, simple woeful. The worst of them is small fat guy... the most vomit-inducing creature I have ever seen. The fetish men looking like a bear is not better, plain offensive. The last one, long-haired guy is not that pitiful as rest of them. I can stand him with unease, but at least I can.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1<br />
<br />
Like my friend would say:<br />
Watching this anime is the equivalent of going to a bar and meeting a really hot girl, who laughs at all your jokes and pays for her own drinks, then going back to her apartment, into her bedroom, unbuttoning her dress, then slowly slipping off her panties and finding out SHE HAS A PENIS.<br />
<br />
Perfect explanation.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
<br />
In conclusion this anime is crime against humanity and anime scene. It consolidates the absolutely all worst things that could ever happen in anime: no plot, unworthy characters, bad animation, irritating music and disgusting fan service. You feel as if you are watching some bad amercian teen movie like American Pie. Avoid at any cost, just for your mind condition. I loathe emetic creations like that. Even a curiosity is not an excuse... Forgive me, I have sinned.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.
