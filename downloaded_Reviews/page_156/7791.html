    Girl 1: I&#039;m not going to pretend to be friends with someone who has no ambition to improve! If we&#039;re doing this, we&#039;re going to try to be the best in Japan! Are you ready for that?!<br />
Girl 2 (tearing up): I just wanna have fun competing in the Olympics with everyone…<br />

Have you ever seen an anime that is so generic and by-the-numbers, it loops backs to being a unique experience, because nothing else is so close to the platonic ideal of genericness? Rifle Is Beautiful starts as that show. The “sad puppy with a bunny-ears ribbon” face of the MC that permanently looks off-model even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326890">
        when it isn’t ends up being distinct and memorable. The running gag of her being completely flat in clothes and suddenly having massive honkers when stripping is such an awkward and half-assed attempt at sexual pandering, you want to fake being enticed out of pity. Two out of four main girls being literally Rei and Asuka effectively lets this show be an impromptu comedic spin-off of Eva a la Carnival Phantasm - taking the established characters from a drama story and letting them interact in a light-hearted setting. Originality plays a major role in me enjoying a show, and, well, this one is unique one way or another.<br />

Also, there is a reason I used the words “starts as that show.” It’s because this is one of the astronomically rare cases where a series actually gets better later. In the end, Rifle Is Beautiful succeeds in being a show about competitive rifle shooting, which apparently is a sport that exists. I should emphasise it for clarity: this is A SPORTS SERIES ABOUT COMPETITIVE RIFLE SHOOTING, as opposed to a show about girls drinking tea or some other literal nothing. There is this common dimwitted sentiment that being generic automatically makes a show bad. No, it doesn’t. Actual flaws make a show bad. A lack of distinct identity, or, speaking marketing, of any distinct selling point is probably the worst flaw a CGDCT series can have - and is not the case here.<br />
It has almost no flaws in general. Characters (simple as they are) behave in sensible ways. Dialogues sound like they were written by someone who goes outside and talks to people. The writing doesn’t insult human logic and intelligence. The jokes (like the one used as the epigraph) are funny. Art, animation and music don’t make my earballs bleed. The reason I was inspired to review a “generic” series like this in the first place is that it makes for a good case study of how to do a low bar show right.<br />
I knew literally nothing about competitive shooting before watching this, and, although I don’t find the sport itself interesting (no one does, as the show acknowledges), I’ve been presented with a compelling depiction of why certain people would commit themselves to this and what kind of fulfillment they’d be getting out of it.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if you’re wondering why this particular generic sports club CGDCT is rated much lower than all the other similar shows - surprisingly many people were angry and disappointed about the fact that they’re using “fake” rifles, instead of …idk, shooting live ammo in a school gym? Shooting their classmates with the customized AR-15s? Yeah, sorry folks, if you were expecting this kind of school shooting anime then the show isn’t the one with problems.<br />
<br />
9/10 for “Huh, competitive shooting is a thing. Cool.&quot;<br />

    When it comes to a slice of life show with cute girls doing cute things you can&#039;t really mess up. Or so I thought up to this point. This anime though managed to shatter this illusion. First let&#039;s hit the obvious stuff:<br />
1. Story - in slice of life with a club there are not really many options to pick as a plot. Shooting is a sport, so competition it is. Pretty generic, pretty dull, being a slice of life you can&#039;t really expect much drama or sudden turns of events as in sports anime, so nothing more to say about it.<br />
2. &quot;Cute girls doing cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326909">
        things&quot; should have cute girls and things they do. And here is the first major problem - shooting is not really the most spectacular sport. Well, at least range shooting with laser rifles, watching competition shooting with people moving between targets and real guns is fun, but it is understandable that a school club will never have those (giving minors actual guns is not the best idea), so all we have here are girls standing still and shooting at a static target. While it is not the easiest thing to participate in, it is still pretty dull to watch.<br />
3. And the second big problem - the actual girls. A bunch of stock generic presets, with no original quirks, with nothing actually standing off - those characters don&#039;t really pull their weight in the task of entertaining the viewer. Add to the boot a very &quot;special&quot; artstyle, that makes the whole anime look like they had no budget for graphics, so not only they do dull things, but they also look very basic, with no detail or beauty. And maybe it was just me, but those rifles looked like they were done in CGI with half the framerate of the actual anime, so they looked out of place in every single scene they were present.<br />
<br />
And cause of the stuff I said above you can&#039;t really enjoy this anime: there is simply no plot to be worried about and interested in, characters are so basic that you will not even remember them in a week, and everything looks so dull and basic that it doesn&#039;t even catch your eye, neither it does hold your attention. The only reason I finished this anime is the fact that I don&#039;t like dropping things I have started watching or reading. I don&#039;t recommend this anime if you are not a huge fan of shooting.

    Surprised this has as low rating as it does. Sure, it comes down to personal enjoyment. But this show is rather pleasant and fun. I suppose seeing it done so many times. It&#039;s gonna get stale. But I didn&#039;t think so here, as I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re introduced into four main characters. Each with different personalities whom revive a recently disbanded shooting club and form friendships through the shooting club. Along with having goals for said club.<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why I&#039;m really enjoying this anime. The characters are nice, as actual likeable characters are needed for an anime to be good going forward. As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321283">
        I&#039;m not unsure of any of the cast so far. From how cute the air head maid can be, to how serious another character can be. They&#039;re all great. I couldn&#039;t really pick a favourite between them, they&#039;re all good characters in their own right.<br />
<br />
The art and sound is great too. Very pleasing on the eyes and the ears.<br />
<br />
While the pacing can be a little questionable at times, overall it&#039;s still a typical fun show of cute girls doing cute things and being part of a club. Despite it being done a ton, it&#039;s still worth the watch in my book.

    Let’s go! Saa Let’s go! ~~<br />
follow your dreams and make it come true!<br />
<br />
The cover picture of &quot;Rifle is beautiful&quot; already shows that it is a CGDCT anime. I am an absolute fan of my cute girls, but not a fan of the CGDCT + action combination. In my opinion, these two things don&#039;t really go well together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rifle&quot; - what do you associate with this word? Fighting, hunting, shooting and much more that has to do with the action category. So, at first I was a bit skeptical about this anime, whether it would be similar to &quot;Granbelm&quot; (which I have dropped after three episodes because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326896">
        of the fighting action there). Fortunately, this is not the case here. Already in the first episode you can see that it is a rifle club in the school, where our four protagonists take part after class. A rifle club also shoots, but luckily not at people or animals, only on non-moving targets.<br />
<br />
STORY and CHARACTERS:<br />
Each of us has a goal that he or she wants to achieve. Our four rifle shooting girls have only one goal in mind: to win the national title in rifle shooting! Together they work slowly but surely to make their dream come true.<br />
The Rifle Club of Chidori High, where our girls go, has already been closed. With the main help from Hikari, however, it was brought back to life. Together with her three friends, they went through good and bad times. Although each of the four girls has a different personality, their chemistry is right. Little by little they got better at rifle shooting and can keep up with the very best.<br />
In addition to our four protagonists, there are of course girls from other schools, who also show a strong will to win. Despite the rivalry, it remains peaceful and friendly. The harmony remains.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
The characters are all super cute. The animations are very good and very colorful. Anyone who is a fan of the CGDCT style is certainly in good hands here.<br />
<br />
MUSIC:<br />
The opening and ending are sung by our four protagonists, which is always a big plus for me. In addition to the OP and ED, our girls from the idol group Rifling4 have a few more singles, which are also very nice to listen. The group itself is certainly not nearly as well-known as e.g. our Love Live girls μ&#039;s, Aqours or Nijigasaki High. Nevertheless, there is certainly a lot of potential behind them. Their music is very nice to listen to and gives you power.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
After the first couple of episodes, to be honest, I was a bit skeptical, since not much happened. Nothing has changed in the story and the background of the characters have not been explained in detail. But when the competitions came little by little, the development of the anime began.<br />
You get to know their rifle shooting history and why they chose this sport. One of the things that particularly excites me is that I got to know a new sport. I have never heard of it before, let alone know the rules. All of this is also mentioned in detail in the anime.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
For an CGDCT category, this anime has certainly worked well. The harmony between the characters is there. You have fun watching the girls doing their actions. Step by step they achieve their dream. We have to work on our own dreams too and try to make them possible! Even if we do fail, we have to learn from it and become stronger!<br />

    Anime is known for turning the mundane into the spectacular, using concepts and topics one could not imagine to be entertaining in a media setting to craft wonderfully amusing stories. Anime has brought us shows about rakugo, farming, shogi, after school tea time, Karuta and other topics one couldn’t possibly imagine would be a hit. When I first heard that there would be an anime about shooting rifles, I was a bit apprehensive, but hopeful given the past history anime has had with bringing out the best of the mundane and given the general high production quality of studio 3hz. Sadly, these hopes were dashed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326888">
        fairly quickly as Rifle is Beautiful is not a sleeper hit, its just boring, and it has lower production quality than the average JC Staff series which is a new low for studio 3hz.<br />
<br />
Let’s talk a bit about the characters, the main cast consists of possibly the dumbest girl in anime with a goofy smile and possibly the most oversized head ribbon in existence, another basic redhead tsundere, another blue haired quiet girl, and the brown hair straightman normal girl. As you can tell the character designs and how the characters were written, and their roles executed throughout the story was quite uninspired. Hibike might be the single most annoying and comically stupid protagonist I have had the displeasure of coming across in anime, normally I find stupid girls with big ribbons to be incredibly moe, but typecasting has gone way to far this time. Everything Hibike does screams that this girl is a three year old in the body of a 15-year-old who happens to some how be able to speak yet at the same time say nothing meaningful. All she wants to do is shoot rifles, eat snacks, and be totally oblivious to literally anything going on around her, her character singlehandedly ruins the show, although the rest of the cast do nothing to redeem the show either. The tsundere is rip off from other popular anime tsunderes and this specific character archetype is considerably less amusing outside of a romcom or action setting, the quiet girl is not deep, she’s just boring and the brown hair girl is so irrelevant that I can’t name a single quality about her that separates her from a background character.<br />
<br />
Now the story itself is practically a parody of more popular underdog sports stories, they happen to be part of a club full of first years and they are trying to win nationals, sounds familiar? There is no tension when a person can reasonably guess everything that is going to happen in the story, and rifle shooting really is a boring sport which the show constantly reminds us with little textboxes mentioning how boring it is, probably the least effective way to deflect the tediousness of watching this already incredibly boring show. Maybe this story could have been written in a way that could have made beam rifle competitions interesting, anything is possible, but rifle shooting is definitely not a sport that translates well to the anime medium given that accurately depicting it involves a bunch of girls firing invisible projectiles getting scores that we are aren’t sure are hit or miss until the sensor picks it up. <br />
<br />
As for production values, as written earlier the production values are an incredibly low showing for a studio that put out series like Princess Principal and Flip Flappers, this show could have been redeemed if it was at least as flashy or as wild as those series or if there were a lot of effective beam effects such as in Gun Gale Online. However, instead of the usual flashy animation seen by studio 3hz we got animation that made middle school power points look dynamic in comparison, the character designs were all uninspired garbage as well, and the scenery was probably some of the most cookie cutter stuff I have seen in any anime. <br />
<br />
Given this that this show was already a borderline parody in comparison to good sports anime, on top of being poorly written, lacking meaningful characters, and having low quality production values one may wonder why I even bothered watching this. Well it comes down to 2 things, there wasn’t really all that many shows airing on the day this show airs, and because I have a thing for ribbon haired loli characters. That is essentially it, if you don’t have a thing for ribbon hair loli characters and you are not watching this a seasonal show on a day with almost no other anime airing, then please spare yourself from watching this atrocity that is the second worst show I seen this season besides assassins pride, which is the only reason I gave this show a 5 instead of a 4, because a show worse than it exists this season.<br />

    Welcome to my review of Rifle Is Beautiful. This review has minor spoilers in it!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a grand beautiful tale about cute girls doing cute things! Full of wonderful pure lesbians that love each other and want to have fun together! The story may not be complex in the manner,It&#039;s rather about the cute girls and spending their time together!Its heartwarming a lot of  humorous aspects and some lewd situations.Its light warm and cute.Like a CGDCT should be ,And it also drives strong at the Yuri!! The sport itself gets some time! But as i said its more about the girls!! <br />
<br />
<br />
Hikari and her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326889">
        partner Izumi have been together for a long time and in her past done some shooting with laser rifle. And strive to start a shooting club in her school only for females!! Her girlfriend Izumi supports her and helps out in every way she can!! And as always in does CGDCT more females will join their club!! Like Erika that are very skilled and have done some competition with Hikari before, In her younger years. And together they wanna try to qualify to the national! And who knows they may even reach the Olympics!!!  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I like the story and it have the CGDCT essence in it!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The animation is great! Love the warm vibrant colours!! And the appealing females just melts my heart!! Even the CGI are really good!! In general the animation holds an exceptional high standard<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters are just the best. Well behaved easy-going girls.Very warm interesting and charming females., Two of the top shooters Erika and Akira are cousins but with close family&#039;s they grow up together and are more like sisters.And have some rivalry between them but more sister rivalry than fierce competition.We also have the lovely teacher!! Who wants to have a lesbian harem with all my girls!! She is a doll and putting a big smile on my face.And she cares a lot!! She is always there for her students and do her best to help them!! Izumi may not be one of the top shooters. But she try&#039;s real hard and always hangs in there. And learn how important her support is for the other girls! And with some training she have a good chance and  the will to improving herself!! The whole anime is full of lovable girls! We also have some females that take it a bit more serious. But they are not over the top and give some variation.This type of anime is supposed to make the viewer feel comfortable and relaxed. And my girls are doing a  momentum job and succeeded at every levels . So overall the characters are a huge hit!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We have some lighter character development.My girls better themselves with some training!! But mostly they open up more towards each other!! Strengthen their relationship and become a much tighter group. Understanding and accepting each others personality!Rather then have a strong individual growth. They grow and become stronger as a team!! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With all this Yuri going on I just love this anime!! We have girls proposing on multiple occasions!! They clearly says they want to married each other!! And all this talk about girls getting married to each other is so delicious for a Yuri lover like me!! The main girls my two favourites also states they want to have a lesbian wedding and get married in the future!! It&#039;s so cute and warm, Yuri are something holy for me and noting speaks more to my soul!!!  Even the white lily flower have been in picture!! Which is a clear statement this is a media with lesbian females  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sport get some attention!  But are not the main attraction!! The cute girls are of course the big stars here!! And to be consider as a real sport anime, The sport itself must be in focus and the most important aspect!! Friendship and everything else should come after the sport.Here its the opposite. The girls themselves even often says we want to have &quot;&quot;FUN&quot;&quot; noting more.We will try our best but the result is not that important.They much rather wants to be friends or lovers than rivals. The shooting is only there to give them something to do like a hobby, as many other CGDCT shows have , It&#039;s a mere springboard to elevate the girls. But its still about them and their relationships rather than being successful in a sport!! If you want to watch a real sport anime please do so, But this is not it!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, Do you like CGDCT and Yuri? And heartwarming anime with very mellow type of competition and rivalry.Where the girls rather have fun then take things to serious? If this is to your liking&#039;s I think you will enjoy this as much as I do!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dedicate this review to my lovely lesbian angel Hikari!! That never backs down on her believes that is most important to have fun together with her friends!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!!!

    Cute girls doing cute things is a love it or hate it genre filled with love it or hate it shows.  A genre that has very little meaningful development or change but who cares?  The appeal is clear.<br />
<br />
Let me be clear I do not harbor any ill will to the genre.  I actually appreciate the shows that fall under this broad and interesting genre.<br />
<br />
Whatever good will I have for such a genre was quickly ignored when I saw the first episode of this anime.  No lie I almost fell asleep.  The pace is so slow and unbearable which is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327028">
        shame since girls with guns sounds like a cool concept right?<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s take a side step to talk about the deceit within concept.  Now I am sure there was no intention to deceive the audience but regardless I fell into its unintentional trap.  Since I am born here in burgerland I have a bias towards guns.  Guns are cool and the idea of a bunch of cute girls shooting guns was a neat concept.  The problem being they aren&#039;t shooting guns.  These are light guns.  My interest plummet immediately.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s talk about the other primary genre of this show:  Sports.<br />
<br />
Sports anime can be a captivating experience displaying a complex range of emotions.  Now I did not expect something dramatic but I was not expecting the most boring sport you could imagine.  Imagine a sports anime where everyone stands in a line and pulls a small trigger.  The most boring idea conceivable for the genre.<br />
<br />
The visuals for this anime teeter between slightly below average to the most shockingly mundane use of CG I can think.  When the girls are running around and doing cute things the anime is animated how you would imagine.  Nothing special or unique.  Once the shooting begins is where the visuals become the most laughable use of CG I can imagine.  When the girls are standing there, without moving and pulling triggers their bodies become CG.  The least intensive actions anime could possibly take is animated in CG.  Why?!<br />
<br />
The story is nothing to write home about.  Imagine a sports anime where they do almost none of the work and still make it to nationals.  Characters would just come and go without any lasting impact unless they were gay of course.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack;s only notable entry is the opening theme.  It has a catchy beginning I am sure you see people parroting in the episode threads.<br />
<br />
In conclusion I would say you skip this anime.  There are plenty of better cute girls doing cute things shows to waste your valuable time with.  A show where its only merit is that it can be competent some of the time.  A boring gray of strange CG light gun shooting monotony.

    It&#039;s a bit disappointment seeing the end of the summer what is felt by Chidori School rifles shooting club. Their National Competition in individual stages doesnt come well enough to prove the strength. Only Erika, the worst player in the team stages, cause of failure for the Chidori team. But then, with no clue, come as the only participacion Prefectur had, in the final Individual stages. The cause of failure in the previous episode being the hero at the other stages, Hime-chan what happen to you? what are planning in this scenario, author? I laughed so hard, when that scenes arrived. Your main heroine, your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334881">
        typical beloved MC, lost bringing the horrible score , without any cause. Bad day was the only reason to answer such a failure, i feel bad for you, Hikari-chan. Idk if that was good movement for the sake of the plot, some people may think thats just a bullshit. But, i realise something in ny mind: its a unique shot, a wise decision. The plot settings sometimes really become unbeliavable, unexpected turn. No exception in this show. A surprised, a shocking moment i had, finally, after long wait at other show i have seen before. This is really the best shocking therapy i ever reach. <br />
<br />
After giving the classic shock a la Shounen or Shoujo Anime in the first half of the season, RiB shows an astonishing storyline at the end. A very brilliant step taken as a step to anticipate the audience to be bored in the end to the same story on every show. Thus, a wise decision was thrown up. I can be said thats was such a realistic show for a heroine in the show itself. I smiled proudly with the decision, an excellent idea!<br />
<br />
Another best decision to improve the story progression. I must say this is a unique flow of the development toward story and characterization. If depicted on a chart, the development of the story patterned up and down, twisted like a crazy at some scenes. Even, i found it so funny and make me smirk when the heroine become too hero, then in the next scene she suddenly be a loser. No shit, its turn out to be an amazing way to pointing out development of the story and character.<br />
<br />
The whole story premised seems progress in the good pace. I can clearly understand the whole situation after the first half, and believe the last episode cant be judge as a rushed animations compare the other competition. Again, this is just a 1 cour show with no sign of another continuations season. What do you expect for it to happen in the future? A bit stressed may come at one point, only to remember this is the show habit, i wont blame it. I shall give thanks the studio can slowly give nice conclusion at the end. That was a brilliant movement, stop with nonsense cliffhanger or open ending bullshit. RiB prove to me how well the progress till the end, after some thing too rushed, the pacing time still in the normal situations for me.<br />
<br />
Thank for the nice first half of the show. I give the thumbs up for the introduction scene, it surely cliche with the club plot as a plot point. But, nevermind it, Shoting rifle just an innovative thing to prove people to be so wrong about this show. Yet, this show never get a chance to improve to the community, due to the low impact the audience had toward this show, i myself believe this had a place to be the best in my heart. I respect this, the character, the main concept, the premises, and ofc the end. I highly recommended this as your unique watch, not just your typical CGDCT, SoL, Shoujo, or whatever the previous show had. With all of that, i obv wanna give the story and enjoyment section my solid 10 as a tribute for their good job animations. Yes, the story always be my only preferred to the enjoyment section. If none, the character, and the art shall be my last judgement toward the whole serialization.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it wont be good to the characterization section. A bit low standard happen to the character visualization. Main heroine become to stale comparing to the other animes. No joke, this is serious, idk why but my feeling always realise how character here almost had same behaviour to the other show characterization. I facepalmed, even her visual seem too standard and dont have a unique point to pointing out the strength. Only the rifle shoting ability, just it. With that only point come to surface, people can not see you as their favourite object, which is a shameful for the whole series.<br />
<br />
Still, i believe with this series. The improvement shall be better come at the right time, far in the future. Thats all for this section, no other summary beside their character being a cute being. Its progression felt in a nice way, nor be the best tho. But in the end clearly become the highest peak to the development. I won&#039;t say much about Yuri bait, i completely ignore it because not be my fan except only for the fun thingy. If you like the concept, you will love them. And sometimes, i feel it just the way to bring the joke side rather being into the romance side. No hard feeling with that approach, the story really make me believe this show has come into the handy one. As that all explain so well, i shall give this 7 to the characterization site. I wish it improve better in the next time.<br />
<br />
Along with the music and sound thing, this section feel as the second strength after story progression. I love how VA dubbed the character. It shocked me with no popular VA in these show, which is somehow irrirated me. This show really better get more chance to shine in the anime community! I find the music background fitted so amazingly fine with some battle scene toward shoting competition. I can feel the character feeling, even with the short glance and some rushed animations, the music system fit in such a nice contributions. 9 point for all of them, no other reason can compare any judgement.<br />
<br />
Afterall, such a shame why the comunity put this show as their lowest thought. I believe this is your underrated show, you always judge its cover before reading the full version of the story. I hate when people may think that shit. But, once again, what can i do? I can&#039;t change other peoples mind. What i only can just this: sharing my thought how amazing this show was. This is not just your typical CGDCT or Yuri bait thingy, or SoL, or Game, or Shoujo Shounen classic Main idea, or else. This is Rifle Shoting main concept of the animations. This is the official sport that is competed at the Olympics section. If basketball, soccer balls,, baseball, even Shogi games can be that famous, why can&#039;t this be too? Sentai Studio has given the best, the show has been held with amazing concepts. Why don&#039;t we provide more opportunities for this show to develop well in the future? I believe, i trust, i shall give the applause for this show to improve better in the next time.<br />
<br />
8 points for the overall, you deserved that RiB show. I may give the rate above 8, but, with no clues for the continuations im a bit sighed. With the fact due to the lower rate in the character visualizations has, i shall give my apologise. Still, 8 point will be the best way to start the series. Give me more your nice tallent in the next match, Hikari and the Rifle Club team. And i promise to give you my solid 10 points for your hard work. Can i? And then, can you?

    &quot;You forgot the funny&quot;-Spongebob shitpost<br />
<br />
Bad CGI, basic and cliche characters that get introduced within 5 minutes, boring story arcs, and a repetitive beginning.<br />
<br />
You don&#039;t exactly need to have good characters or art to succeed in the CGDCT genre. You can totally make it up with good dialogue and story arcs. Unfortunately, you get neither in this show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a very below average show about girls in a club sport. The only unique distinction is the type of sport: rifle shooting. A unique sport does not make an anime unique, however, especially when it&#039;s a light hearted slice of life show. There has to be some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328317">
        sort of distinct trait that this show needs to have to keep my attention. Hell, not even something distinct. Just something well made.<br />
<br />
It didn&#039;t. At least, these types of shows are quite consistent from episode one since they don&#039;t tend to have any sort of plot, and I can safely drop this very early into the show. Nothing special will happen later that will magically bring this anime to anything more than moot mediocrity<br />
<br />
The terrible story arcs and characters, paired along with very sub-par rifle CGI and the overall irrelevance of the sport (you could replace the rifle sport with practically any other sport and it would work) makes this a no-go for me.

    Rifle Is Beautiful (2019)<br />
<br />
High school club for target rifle. Due to Japanese restrictions on firearms they use beam rifles. This is a common way to do it in real life in Japan. Not so in other countries due to cost not being a lot of difference as restrictions are generally less. <br />
<br />
Our main girl Hikari is a clumsy girl with a huge red ribbon. It turns out to be a headband later on. She is a cute girl with the temperament when it comes to shooting to thrive best under pressure and fails otherwise. Her luck is very varied. She wants to get to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327803">
        Olympics and the other three will join her quest going forward. <br />
<br />
The art of the show is fine, it can be a bit clumsy at times with a lacking of refinement. At the same time it is a nice art form for this show being a fairly average budget. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED are fun and memorable. The character voices in Japanese are all very cute and nice. <br />
<br />
Characters are generally good. They fit into some generic styles with Erika being a Tsundere and so on. They are developed well throughout the show and are nicely known by the end. <br />
<br />
The show itself is fun to watch but also a bit niche. The subject itself like the real thing requires patience. It is not a fast paced story with lots of fan service. It is quite the opposite but that sits nicely around the subject. It comes into a cute girls doing cute things style. <br />
<br />
Overall, it is a good show but doesn&#039;t do anything crazy nor does it do anything particularly new. The art style brings it to sit very average overall.<br />

    Rifle Is Beautiful is a series that presents itself as a sort of CGDCT/Sports anime that doesn&#039;t quite hit its mark.<br />
<br />
Of course with the limited premise of girls in a rifle shooting club being presented in a restrained, believable world, this can be expected.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
The story begins with a scene of the big bowed, bubble headed Hikari running around the school attempting to find the Rifle Shooting Club that she&#039;s wanted to join since her childhood. With the help of her friend and fellow riflewoman Izumi, she discovers that the club has since disbanded and in true CGDCT fashion, needs to find two more students

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327057">
        to join so that they can have a club. This quickly leads to them recruiting experienced competitors; Yukio, a quiet marks(wo)man with incredible skill and sarcasm, and Erika, a prideful, driven girl aiming to be the best.<br />
This group of clashing personalities come together as they try to get their shit together to compete in the national tournament. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed the way the story was handled, it moves along fast enough to present itself so as not to bore the viewer with the limited content you could make out of a mostly stationary sport. The conclusion was satisfying and grounded, and throughout the series there&#039;s plenty of breathing room for characterization to be written into the girls through their interactions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art in Rifle Is Beautiful isn&#039;t perfect. Shots are nicely composited, colors are picked very well for Studio 3hz that you&#039;d be forgiven for at first thinking it&#039;s a Doga Kobo work. The rifles themselves are largely CG and have this weird framerate thing going on that doesn&#039;t work well with the rest of the animation, given that rifle shooting is the main focus, it&#039;s concerning why more time wasn&#039;t put into getting this right. Characters are drawn well and their actions help breathe life into them. Once in a while the anime will divert into a simple chibi/derpy art style that doesn&#039;t take away from the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The sound is just fine for the series. While the OP isn&#039;t all that memorable it serves its purpose. The VAs made the conversations and jokes between the characters seem believable, and the music throughout did its job to create the atmosphere intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
The characters in Rifle Is Beautiful are pretty generic. Hikari is an overly derpy character, Erika comes off as a tsundere, Yukio is quiet and sarcastic, and Izumi plays a straight man that serves to prop up Hikari. I do feel that the writers did a good job at making these characters play off of eachother, though the humor is often a &quot;this,that,but actually this&quot; kind of setup-fakeout-punchline payoff.<br />
Supporting characters each have their own quirks to fill out the cast and differentiate them from each other.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
<br />
I can appreciate what Rifle Is Beautiful did with it&#039;s limited concept and likely limited art budget. It was able to deliver a moe sports-dramcom story without feeling like it was stalling too much, and oftentimes the jokes were hitting the beats in the right places. If you aren&#039;t a fan of CGDCT I would definitely not recommend it for you, however I feel it was a good experience that won&#039;t be anything incredibly memorable, but fun to look back on.<br />
