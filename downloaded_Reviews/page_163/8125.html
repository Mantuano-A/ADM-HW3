    11eyes, in the beginning, showed potential to be a &quot;10&quot; or &quot;9&quot; grade anime. Some shows went on and grew the beard. This one, on the other hand, devolved into something else. However, this wasn&#039;t exactly a devolution into the worst of the worst.<br />
<br />
Story - 4/10<br />
<br />
The anime showed pretty strong potential to be a very good supernatural themed story. The concept was used before. This did not discourage me from watching it though. One can use mediocre concepts and turn it into gold. I first saw this aspect as gold. This view, however, devolved and the story slowly but surely turned into something else: A

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22776">
        screwy and awkward one. An interesting story suddenly became VERY awkward and weird. Suddenly, it&#039;s like the other characters lost their competence and some even derailed into &quot;dreadful and annoying&quot; (I&#039;m looking at you, Yuka.) And the rest just got... blah. I&#039;ll give it a 4 for managing to be really interesting early on.<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
11eyes definitely has great art. Arts from other more complicated series cannot be compared to this one since its main focus was the &quot;moe&quot; aspect. Characters that have cute traits like big eyes and the like are found in it. Some battle scenes did look a bit awkward though. At one time, I was expecting an epic fight between two master swordsmen. It shifts to one scene. And then cue to a scene where one of them says &quot;She&#039;s too strong.&quot; and don&#039;t fight anyway. It&#039;s like they ran out of budget to make a big fight scene. That was fail. This gets 7 for being really good at what the art&#039;s supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9/10<br />
<br />
The opening &quot;Arrival of Tears&quot; by Ayane and &quot;Sequentia&quot; by Asriel are suberb themes and are actually VERY addicting. The BGM of the show, too, was great. Epic music was around. This gets a 9.<br />
<br />
Character - 6/10<br />
<br />
The characters are stereotypical, that&#039;s for sure. The characters were made to cater to your fetishes. This was ok, I understand. It was the point. And then IT happened. One of the main girls degraded into a sick little girl with her own sick little fantasies. And as I said earlier, suddenly most of the cast became incompetent in combat and the main guy just became central view of the show. What the heck happened? This gets a 6 for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7/10<br />
<br />
Although not that good, I definitely enjoyed this show. Admittedly, it catered to me, being a moe anime after all. It&#039;s my type. Later on this interest disappeared due to... complications in story. This gets a 7 in enjoyment - it&#039;s quite entertaining to watch nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6/10<br />
<br />
11eyes, though deserving lots of the flak from our fellow watchers, is a pretty ok anime. It barely crosses &quot;5&quot; territory, which for me is a low score already. Overall, 11eyes cannot be considered a great or a superb anime. But undeniably the show is decent enough to stand. But if one looks for story and development in an anime, 11eyes is not for you.

    What starts out as an interesting supernatural mystery/action romance quickly devolves into the &quot;I&#039;m the main character and only useful one&quot; cliche with a such a feeble plot that anyone with critical thinking skills will be disgusted.  <br />
<br />
Story - 2/10<br />
The plot is paper thin.  High school kids are randomly transported to the Red Night, a red mirror world of danger and isolation, where they must fight for survival against random threatening things and, of course, the Black Knights.  Although, it is explained later that these kids are &quot;special&quot;, it is never explained why the kids, who&#039;d lived lives of relative normalcy, are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21875">
        suddenly whisked away on some random day to The Red Night.  (Must be the power of adolescence.)  <br />
<br />
The big reveal of the story is as poorly implemented as it is predictable.  Instead of undermining the heroes&#039; determination by causing confusion and guilt, there&#039;s merely a glaring dissonance between the bad guys&#039; actions and their supposed motivations.  The bad guys&#039; actions should have taken on new meaning and made the heroes make a choice that would forever define their characters and wrap up the themes of survival, self-sacrifice, and friendship.  However, it is handled so poorly that the Bad guys create the things they&#039;re supposedly trying to guard against.  This dissonance precludes any type of meaningful conclusion because the series has apparently run against simple logic since the very beginning, rendering the conflict irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
Art - 6/10 <br />
The art is fairly bland.  There&#039;s nothing particularly wrong with any of the art, but there is nothing distinctly memorable either.  The Red Night is unremarkable, merely a copy of the real world with a red tint, and the Black Knights&#039; sanctum, if it can be called such, is never defined except for some red giant stalagmites.  The most interesting things art wise are Misuzu&#039;s swords, summoned by the power of nail-polished symbols.  (Hurray!)  <br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
The sound is good.  Usually unnoticeable, it does a good job setting up the atmosphere.  <br />
<br />
Character - 3/10<br />
In a rare stroke for the &#039;highschool kids save the world&#039; genre, the main character isn&#039;t given an immediate power up.  Instead, he acts with a realistic mixture of fright, confusion, and desperation when he and his childhood friend/love interest are transported into a world that is serious about killing them.  In fact, for their first few encounters with the Red Night, they must be protected by a kick-ass female swordswoman, who&#039;s competence and prudence is the only thing that keeps them alive, as the main character trains to be able to protect himself and his girl.  <br />
<br />
This characterization was the first thing that drew my attention and gave me hope that we&#039;d see mature character development throughout the series as Kakeru worked under Misuzu&#039;s guidance to become independent and a protagonist worthy of protecting what he held dear.  Unfortunately, the main character becomes the most powerful of the heroes through a power up while the kickass female slowly loses her competence and independence for really no other reason than to make the main character look more manly and heroic be comparison.   (Did the creators want to keep the suck ratio of the group constant?)  Meanwhile, all the other characters who had their own strengths and quirks, regress to worthless, crazy, withering piles of fear and despair.  Still, this could have been salvageable, by sticking to the harsh realities of the main character&#039;s unrealistic goal of protecting innocence, but the ending made whatever tragedies happened to the characters null.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3/10 <br />
As someone who dislikes fanservice, this anime&#039;s constant use of panty-shots was an ever present annoyance.  The anime never missed an opportunity to take off clothes and even used the cop out of &quot;you must have sex to save the world&quot; excuse to maintain the main character&#039;s integrity even though he was getting some from a girl he obviously didn&#039;t love.  Although fanservice annoys me, I will tolerate it in anime where the plot and characters are genuinely interesting.  However, since that is not the case with 11eyes, the fanservice sticks out as another detraction. <br />
<br />
Overall - 3/10 (Poor) <br />
While the first episodes look promising, the anime loses all sense of itself by failing at drama and backing away from the harsh themes they set up by its poorly written plot.  You&#039;re better off looking for another supernatural series for entertainment as this one is a big disappointment.  There are plenty of better ones out there.

    I hated this anime with a passion that can destroy cities. I am writing this review in hope to burn, char, and devour it in the forest of my mind and never have to remember it. The anime was based of an intuitive game by the creator &quot;feng&quot; of &quot;Akane-iro no somaru saka&quot; fame. If you know feng at all, you know that the anime adoptions of his games tend to suck. Suck hard. Let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story starts out typical shonen and for 10 out of 12 episodes follows a formulaic episode set-up. Walk around the real world, red night, fight scene, return to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21723">
        real world, repeat. The red night is a parallel world the characters travel to and is essentially the same background with a red paint bucket and some crystals jutting out of the ground. The story is really just &quot;Fight the monsters&quot; in the red night for ten episodes until the main characters realize that the bad guys are actually the goods guys, they are the bad guys, the main girl is a retard, and that killing everyone off is a good way to end a show. It&#039;s so painful to watch this show. Then you add a sword master who wants to have sex with our &quot;hero&quot; to &quot;save the world.&quot; Just god damn it all. I literally stopped and walked around my room I was so frustrated. Why? BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE &quot;PLOT&quot; THIS SHOW SET UP.<br />
<br />
Sorry. Let me gather myself.<br />
<br />
Art: 4/10<br />
Okay good. The art is poor. Characters look ugly, move funny, and have weirdly disproportionate bodies. The background is lame and uninteresting. The black knights were probably the best looking things in this anime and as another reviewer said, they looked like crap. There isn&#039;t much to say. Everything looks so generic and repetitive it isn&#039;t even funny.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Best part of the anime, right here. The opening was kind of cool. Not cool enough to want to listen to more than once a week but it was pretty high octane and really got you pumped to watch this show. Too bad the lead in was exactly what it was, just a lead in. The rest of the sound isn&#039;t mind-blowing. Voices are bland, nothing special. The background noises were okay, nothing stellar. The tentacle monsters sounded kind of cool though, but they were quickly hacked away or silenced by the whiny protagonist or one of his annoying friends.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
AHHHHHHHHHHHH.<br />
<br />
Dammit. I want to meet anyone who even slightly liked any of these characters and I would like to punch them square in the face. The characters are so one-dimensional, so straight-forward, so very bad I couldn&#039;t possibly grow to like them. The lead is your usual &quot;profagonist&quot;, he is a loner who is too cool for the lead girl to be with, because he lived life alone as an orphan because his sister died or something. He also wears an eye-patch because he has a yellow eye that somehow holds a 500 year old man inside of it. DUMB! The main girl suffers from severe mental retardation. I think she was supposed to be a yandere (girl who would kill others for her to be alone with her man) or so to speak but she really just comes across as a girl who gets half-naked a lot and walks around, stupidly activating all the bad guys traps, causing a shitload of drama for the main cast. The other characters include a multi-personality killer who when she takes her glasses off goes on a rampage, a loner (AGAIN?) who WAS an orphan and was taken in by the school nurse who is a biker and has amazing assets that shake when on screen to divert your attention from any kind of plot. No seriously. I think they purposely put her on screen to try and make up for plot. The best friend who is freaking annoying and has sideburns and never shuts up about making sexual innuendos that were never funny. The black knights are the saving grace, albeit they too are one-sided boring characters, the bad guys in a typical shonen are kind of supposed to be (I didn&#039;t expect very much of the bad guys and they gave me at least what I asked for). Overall freaking terrible characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
I abhorred every moment I watched this show. This was not fun to watch. I kept looking at my clock hoping for it to end. The most fun I had with this show was writing this very review on it, out of the hope that someone might not watch and get their five hours of life on this planet back.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I&#039;m going to be generous and give it a four. On MAL a four means &quot;decent&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, but on my list of standards a four means &quot;Terrible and avoid like the plague,&quot; and that is exactly what you should do.<br />
<br />
Do not watch this anime. There is a world of better media out their to feast on, and if you will watch this, watch it out of jest with a few friends so you can throw popcorn at the screen when the characters do something stupid. You&#039;re gonna need a lot of popcorn.

    11eyes could have been a not so bad anime if the plot was executed correctly. While it wasn&#039;t the most original, the premise wasn&#039;t half-bad either. Instead we get 12 episodes of pointless fan service, mediocre character development  and massive plot holes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
It was actually hard to find a story within the first half of the show. In fact, it was nothing else than bunch of kids fighting the black knight for whatever reason. You didn&#039;t know why they were transported there and why the black knights were trying to kill them. Until you get to second half, it went down hill. I could

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22618">
        complain that the first half was confusing me more than ever since the story wasn&#039;t developing, but after the second half it was actually better to tell nothing at all. What lacks in the story is the fact that 11eyes made so many plot twists and not intelligent ones that it became embarrassing. A 12 years old could make a more interesting story than that. In the end, the story left many holes and the viewer is still as much confused, or even more, than he was at the first episode.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
<br />
The art was fair to be honest. While most the characters lacked the ability to dress as something else than their school suit, they were actually distinctive. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. <br />
<br />
The animation on the other end, was bad. What strikes me the most, is the terrible fighting choreography.While some expressions the made were plain dumb, they were at least walking correctly.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
It is very sad when the sound is actually the only point that is decent for a show. No doubt about it, the opening and the ending theme song was enjoyable. There&#039;s just a few annoying voice acting, most notably the girls cast, but the viewer can easily get over it.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Where do I begin? Beside the fact that they were mostly cardboards, retards and that the protagonist is lame, there&#039;s nothing more to say. The characters were fair at the beginning of the show. While there are few complaints, they were at least interesting. Somehow, the producer thought it would have been a good idea to add a bit(or too much) dementia in the character development. This is where everything gets embarrassing and everything goes down hill. What I hate the most is that you can&#039;t say which is more retard between Yuka and Kakeru. Yuka is a lame yandere and a dumb blonde(even is she&#039;s not blonde) and Kakeru is just lame, retard and ignorant. The three other main characters aren&#039;t better either. Yukiko is just plainly annoying, Misuzu is a slut with no soul and Takahisa is your typical hot head guy. It is funny to see a stereotyped cast, but it&#039;s even funnier to see a stereotype cast trying to act in drama situations. I find it very very very sad the best characters were actually the ones that were just there for fillers. Yes I&#039;m talking about Saiko.<br />
<br />
I did not enjoy this show, while it wasn&#039;t that painful, the story didn&#039;t make any sense and the characters are quite lame. Not to mention that they actually inserted fan service in scenes where it was supposed to be sad, or at least emotional. 11eyes is badly executed and is perhaps among the worst anime of 2009.

    Well based on the 2 episodes I&#039;ve seen, I say that they&#039;re is alot of potential for this anime. Story is good so far, but very vague. We dont really know too much of the past&#039;s of the main characters, but I know that we soon will. I love the characters so far, different peronalities (something I havent seen in a while). So far I have to say I am enjoying this anime and it does leave me wanting to see more. Im mad because I found it too early(i hate it when it leaves you in suspense). The only thing that might discourage you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19791">
        from watching this, is that you might think its too vague. You just gotta be patient!<br />
<br />
 11 eyes is a must see for the fall 09&#039; anime line-up.^_^<br />
<br />

    Visual novel adaptations, in my experience, tend to range from very good to very bad. 11eyes has done the impossible and achieved both at once. <br />
<br />
Having just finished the last episode, I have to say, it looks like the animators just ran out of time when they were trying to complete the show, but still had about 30% of the game&#039;s text to cover in a mere 22 minutes. <br />
<br />
So, <br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
It&#039;s not a unique storyline. Boy and friends get pulled into parallel universe where they fight various monsters for an unknown objective. It&#039;s been done before, but was much better in Final Fantasy Tactics

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21650">
        Advance. Especially in the last few episodes, the show tends to mention things casually as though they were the most natural thing ever:<br />
   &#039;You can travel through space-time?&#039;<br />
   &#039;Yes.&#039;<br />
From what I can tell, playing the game in order to get the &#039;full experience&#039; of the storyline might be a better option than watching the show. That being said, there&#039;s no English patch for the game, so yeah...<br />
<br />
Art:8/10 <br />
Animation-wise, 11eyes was consistently good. It looked clean and attractive, even on QUALITY 480p video. My one complaint about the art is that the hoard of &#039;Black Knights&#039;, while decent designs, had literally no detail. It was like watching flat-texture enemies. Which frankly sucked. Otherwise, it was good.<br />
<br />
Sound:9/10<br />
One of the things that really caught me by surprise was the sound in this show. Quite often, there are dissonant ringing sounds or booming noises that just catch your attention, because they&#039;re loud and awesome sounding, much like watching a movie in a theater when the sound is loud enough to make the room shake. Lost a point because sometimes when it was that loud, the sound actually got distorted, which could just be the quality of the videos I was watching, but meh.<br />
<br />
Character:6/10<br />
I never learned any characters names other than the two main characters. They&#039;re basically the same archetypes in every popular show but with different hair and eye color. There&#039;s the kuudere sword girl, dandere mysterious magician, token annoying perverted friend and the included random girl that beats him up, happy-lovey naive main girl, yandere girl with a scary dark past, main guy who is &#039;stupid and reckless but has a kind heart&#039;, etc etc. Same old. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9/10<br />
This show did catch me by surprise at some times. At those times, I said &#039;Hey, this is great&#039;. Until the last episode, when everything was rushed, glossed over, and never properly concluded. There is going to be an OVA in the summer, but it seems like it will have different content, since apparently the main storyline is over. I&#039;m hoping it takes some time to explain some of the &#039;casually mentioned in conversation&#039; things such as time-space travel, Abraxas the spirit, and other things I won&#039;t mention to avoid spoilers. <br />
<br />
Overall:8/10<br />
Good but stale.

    When I began watching this I found it to be quite interesting.  I was hoping for a good story but as it progressed I felt there was a lack of character development---that or the anime is REALLY slow since I&#039;m on the latest episode-9. <br />
<br />
The story focuses on fighting these weird dark magical knights.<br />
The thing is the audience doesn&#039;t even know why these dark knights are fighting the main characters in the first place.... i mean they held it off enough and it&#039;s just pissing me off.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;m just watching it for the sake of knowing what&#039;ll happen--- thank God it&#039;s only gonna be

    11eyes was kind of painful to watch. It started off with a storyline that intrigues making you wonder what the &quot;red night&quot; is all about, but then it starts to lose you. First, let&#039;s start with the good. The character designs are pretty nice especially the &quot;black knights&quot; and the artwork and fighting scenes are done well. <br />
<br />
Now the bad. It&#039;s hard to like an anime when the main protagonists annoy you. It&#039;s also annoying when every sentence that comes out of the main character&#039;s mouth is &quot;protect Yuka, Yuka this, Yuka that&quot; or &quot;Where&#039;s Kakeru, Kakeru this Kakeru that.&quot; Kakeru and Yuka&#039;s relationship destroys

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23417">
        everything that&#039;s good about the series and by the end, you wish the whole world gets destroyed along with the writers of this story as well.

    Story: 6<br />
<br />
I at first enjoyed the storyline, about the first two to four episodes. I found the story to rather draw me in, because I wanted to know the secret of the ulter dimension. However, as details began to be revealed, I got to be rather disgruntled  with the whole thing. It seemed rather rushed, and something that should have been spread out to something much longer. I was also left with a sour feeling in my stomach, as I rather didn&#039;t like the ending.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
The art starts of phenominal. This wass something that had drawn me in, the beautiful details, the colors. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21872">
        found that to be rather impressive. What I didn&#039;t find to be impressive was the fact that the animation really did begin to slack off as it got closer to the end of the anime. It seemed some sections got more time spent on them then others, and the movement that I had seen in the first few episodes, just wasn&#039;t there.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
I LOVED the sounds. This was one of the things that seemed to almost stick through to the very end of the whole anime, but not quite.<br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
<br />
I have to say, I rather didn&#039;t like Yuka. As her personality developed, she became more self centered about her relationship with Kakeru, and forgot her other friends, which has a rather negative effect in the end. She can really be blamed for a lot of the problems that happen later on. There was also the fact that my very favorite characters rather got sidelined towards the end, or completly cut out.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
I started of enjoying it, but then I started enjoying being mad at the story creators and the storyline, and what happened to the characters. Shure, it is a really good, twisted storyline, but it is one of those that I wasn&#039;t happy with the ending. There are others that end happy, with a sad note, but this one rather takes the cake.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
Watch 11eyes with a precautinary note. As much as there was that I liked about the anime, there was equally as muh that drove me nuts about it.

    Boy! Is my first time when I saw a supernatural anime type...But if all anime&#039;s are like this one...I might love this type.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
<br />
For me is the first time when I see this type of plot so I can&#039;t say others anime had this or not....but one thing is for certain...It had a unique plot and a very interesting one If I may say....The thing with the &quot;red night&quot; sending some kids into a paralel world with monsters and of course black knights made me wonder if that could happen in real life too [yeahhh I&#039;m crazy nyaa~ ^_^ -]...As the story advances the plot&#039;s getting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30604">
        more and more interesting...showing us the past of that witch &quot;Witch of Babilon was it? -] , and the past of Velad too...all was mixed smooth and nicely done...I was a bit puzzled with the &quot;different worlds&quot; thing and &quot;6 type of shards sealed in a world&quot; but happy me I managed to understand....<br />
<br />
Art.<br />
Beautifully well done and some outstanding landscapes...the part with the black moon coming to that big building was plain awesome!<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
This part kindda disapointed me....for such a nice anime it could add better OP and ED...I listened to both of these...I really tried...but I didn&#039;t like it very much...there are really bad anime&#039;s with awesome songs and OP/ED...why did this jewell had to have such a booring OP/ED ?<br />
<br />
Character.<br />
Nicely drawn character with unique traits.But to be honest I hate&#039;d Yuka&#039;s development...she became at a point of the anime WAY  to obsesed with Kakeru...So from the admiration I got for her at the first episodes transformed into rage and hate for her stupidity and obsesion over Kakeru.My favourite was the red haired swordsman....Misuzu...in my opinion she is a better match for Kakeru than Yuka.I liked the episode with her and Kakeru getting laid lol :&quot;&gt; *blush* .Wish all female characters from anime&#039;s were as cool as her and strong[not every girl have&#039;s 5 legendary swords at her dispoasal y&#039;know nyaa~-]...she is cute...caring...and have&#039;s one great body nyaa~<br />
<br />
Enjoyment.<br />
I enjoyed the most of episodes...It kindda pissed me the episodes that shown me an obsessed Yuka beging for love...In that moment I was screaming at the screen &quot;you biatch what&#039;s the f*ck is wrong with you? If you really love Kakeru snap out of it&quot; ...That&#039;s when I was even more than convinced that Misuzu is the perfect match for Kakeru.<br />
<br />
Overall.<br />
It&#039;s been awhile since I last gave a masterpiece rate[yep a 10 nyaa~] .I see in the reviews of others that gave low scores...I don&#039;t know why...even though is my first supernatural anime watched I think is well made and deserves the 10&#039;th score, masterpiece.

    Save yourself the time and don&#039;t bother with this one.  While I can&#039;t call it the worst anime I&#039;ve seen, 11 Eyes certainly has to be up there on that list.  The idea behind it isn&#039;t actually bad at all, but the way it was done and really pretty much everything about this anime was just plain awful.<br />
<br />
11 Eyes is about a guy named Kakeru and a group of high schoolers that have powers and go into this parallel universe-type thing they call Red Night randomly every once in a while and while there are attacked by the Black Knights.  The way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23136">
        the first episode or two goes, you think that this might be worth something eventually and keep watching.  Sure, they&#039;re moving this story at an impossible pace and I wonder if they can explain everything they need to by the time 12 episodes is up, but there really is some decent potential there.  That&#039;s a mistake.  It gets worse.  Generally in this one, you&#039;ll be sitting there going &quot;what the hell just happened and why,&quot; and ten minutes later when about a tenth of it is explained you go &quot;Oh, I see.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What about the other 900 questions I had?&quot;  And no, none of them will be answered.<br />
<br />
I call this the &quot;answer one question in a flashy way so hopefully the viewers forget about all the plotholes there are and enjoy the show&quot; plot.  It&#039;s rather ingenious really.  And it happens in a lot of anime, but there&#039;s a real showcase here.  Not of them succeeding in diverting your attention, but in that they really don&#039;t answer hardly any questions.  Sometimes a character will realize what&#039;s going on and you can see the lightbulb going off in their head, but no one actually says what&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
The sound and music is dark and ominous, but reminds me of a title track in a game that repeats itself over and over again.  It gets kind of annoying after a while as there is no variety at all and even what they give you is nothing to write home about.  I don&#039;t think the opening and endings were awful but I&#039;ve already forgotten them, so they couldn&#039;t have been that good.<br />
<br />
The characters.  HA!  Where should I go with this.  The characters were pretty awful.  When you meet Kakeru at the beginning you probably feel a mixture of pity and annoyance.  He&#039;s obviously been shafted his entire life, and that really sucks.  But the way he just wants to avoid contact with anyone other than Yuka, who I guess would be considered the female lead, is pretty annoying.  And most of all, between the character design, the voice, and the way he acts most of the time, he really seems like a (very) bad copy of Lelouch Lamperouge.  Yuka is hard to deal with as well, as she is obviously in love with Kakeru and EVERYONE knows it.  And she pretty much knows everyone knows it, and just wants to spend all time forever with him.  She grew up with Kakeru and his sister, who killed herself when they were kids, in an orphanage.  She was adopted and Kakeru went to live by himself, but they stayed together.  Cute right?  Not so much in this case.  As the show goes on you can tell that she actually is pretty demented.  If anyone else comes close to Kakeru she snaps.  It would be disturbing, but they way they did it made it just seem laughable.<br />
<br />
There are other characters that play major parts.  But don&#039;t worry about them.  If you decide to try and watch this show they&#039;re all easy to understand.  And Kusakabe actually isn&#039;t that bad of a character.  A little to serious all the time, but overall I&#039;d actually give her passing marks as a character.<br />
<br />
Next about the enjoyment.  Watching this show because it seems intriguing is kind of like sticking your head in a mulcher because you wonder what it would feel like.  It&#039;s just not a good idea.  After the first couple episodes there&#039;s actually enough excitement(because of the potential) that you want to watch a little more.  Even then there&#039;s not a whole lot of enjoyment.  It&#039;s still more like &quot;it might get better, it might get better.&quot;  But it just never does.  And even before the end of the show you&#039;re left with a vague feeling of disappointment that you watched this show so far and that it really didn&#039;t get better, but in fact continued to get worse.<br />
<br />
Something that I have forgotten to mention yet is the art.  The animation is actually not bad, and the action scenes are pretty decent.  The art style is also one that I usually enjoy as well.  I put art off until now so I could talk about the ecchi parts of the show.  Random winds that flip up girls skirts, Yuka wearing nothing but her underwear trying to come on to Kakeru, and clothes getting torn to shreads to reveal a little skin.  Yes, there is a fair amount of ecchi scenes in the anime.  But the way they were done were simply awful.  Most of these ecchi parts are completely unnecessary and in fact detract from the already painfully bad story.  They way they were done was always bad timing and in bad taste.  I usually like some ecchi here and there, but the way they did it here just made it seem inappropriate.  I&#039;m sure they meant for you to think Yuka is losing it when she strips down on someone&#039;s front porch to try to get close to Kakeru, but it just seems wrong even for that.  Having said all that, in truth the art and animation of the show is one point that you can say gets a decent grade.<br />
<br />
To conclude all of this, I must say once again, don&#039;t bother with this show.  It takes a somewhat promising story and decent art and drives it into the ground.  11 Eyes is not a good anime.  I feel like I wasted time watching it, and it&#039;s bad enough that I almost feel like I&#039;m wasting time writing this review.  But, maybe someone will read this and decide not to watch the show or at least stop after a couple episodes and not hope, like I did that it will get better.  Overall, I give this one a 4.

    Despite the negative reviews, i decided to watch it anyway... to my suprise i really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
The story concept and the characters weren&#039;t overly original, but I still found it an interesting watch with a couple of laughs and a bit of shock factor thrown in. I would recommend it for those wanting to kill some time.

    It is sad when an anime that great is so much underrated.In my point of view it is by far one of the best animes I have ever seen.Everything,from the story to the characters,to the music was fantastic.<br />
   <br />
 STORY 8/10<br />
       The story is very original and sucks you in like a black hole.From the start to the end for sure.The only problems i had with the story were the monsters our heroes were fighting and the ending,kinda.The monsters were pathetic in my point of view except from the black knights.And the ending although i liked it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145683">
        it wasn&#039;t as epic as i was imagining.And don&#039;t get me started at the OVA.<br />
<br />
ART 8/10<br />
     As far as the art is concerned it&#039;s good looking.Although the designs were not outstanding it had great landscapes and felt really big<br />
 <br />
  SOUND 10/10<br />
    What can I say other than it is the best i heard.Epic,dramatic and overall awsome.What more do you need.<br />
<br />
 CHARACTERS 8/10<br />
    The bigest reason why this anime gets so much hate are the characters.And personally I think that is disgustingly stupid.The characters are great.Kakeru cannot be considered as a generic main character, due to his dedication to Yuka.Speaking of Yuka, although annoying she plays her role well as &#039;&#039; an motivating friend,not a damsel in distress&#039;&#039;, and the reason she wants to protect Kakeru is because HE IS HER ONLY FRIEND AND SHE DON&#039;T WANT TO LOSE HIM! Yes she can be really annoying but there is a reason for it.And there are other character as well which are really well developed.Misuzu,Yukiko,Takahisa,Shiori and the rest of the cast are great characters!And I never understoud why everyone focuses only on Yuka.There are many more characters other than Kakeru and Yuka Bakas!<br />
  <br />
    ENJOYMENT 10/10<br />
   Every story ark,every blatle,every dialogue was never boring.And the development of the story was very strong especially the last spech!And even thoughthe ending was not really epic I didn&#039;t care,because I wanted those characters to get out of the red night!Een when it was fanservisy I didn&#039;t care because of the power of the story!!!<br />
   <br />
    so OVERALL 10/10<br />
And a word of andice,don&#039;t let Yuka destroy your reception about this anime and don&#039;t have any expectations before you watch ior else you will get disapointed.

    Now before we get to the review I&#039;m going to give you an important tip for this show. Stop at episode 11. Don&#039;t even watch episode 12, if you do that than this show is 10x better.<br />
<br />
Review: Show is based off a game so I didn&#039;t set my expectations too high going in. The beginning of the show starts off with typical anime high school drama and supernatural junk but half way through the show things start picking up and I was pleasantly surprised at some of the darker and more gruesome issues and incidents that get brought up. One of the scenes in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179711">
        show actually made me do a mental cringe at the gruesomeness of the scene(mostly because I didn&#039;t expect anything like that at all to happen in this show). Unfortunately the show leads you on in thinking that this is where the show is headed and I began to fall for this show thinking that the ending was going to be a dark and gruesome ending(which are the best endings in my opinion). Oh but how wrong I was to assume that. The last half of the 11th episode had me going like &quot;WTF? is this?&quot; and than the 12th episode proceeded to respond to that question with a bitch slap to my intellect... <br />
<br />
This show makes you think that it&#039;s one of those rare gems you find in a bunch of cliche and typical anime, but than at the last second the writers polished off the gleam of the gem and all you find yourself left with is a dried up piece of bullshit...<br />
<br />
Rant(Spoilers):<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t played the game that this show is based off of but still, come on writers!! Unwrap those tentacles from around your brains, like literally the Misuzu and Kakeru fuck scene was an insult... Like here I am thinking to myself, did I just watch 10 episodes of an elaborate setup for a hentai... Heck at that point I would&#039;ve actually appreciated the show more if it did become a hentai scene, but no the writers decided to be like well now that your turned on... Time travelling boner killing plot twist time!!!! GG no re...

    “Adjoining space”<br />
<br />
Come and step inside to a place where full of ridiculous adventures yet to be unfolded unto its end. Begin to discover a world where there’s a variety of monologues to be heard that has an uncertain point. Last but not the least, experience a non thrilling ride where usually some of its scenes is just being annoying. Upon watching it you may feel that it has some intriguing and exciting storyline to expect, but it turns out to be a dull story that doesn’t have any unique or amazing element to be amazed on. It has a story that is composed with such

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27444">
        absurdity which most of them brings a lot of headache to become seriously understandable. Also, as the monologues don’t suit on the situation either on the story, this becomes an exchange of bland thoughts that gives either fluster or total denial on continuing this series. <br />
<br />
With its failure due to its story, there might be a couple or few to be entertained on. One, it contains a fighting scenes that is quite interesting due that it composed of characters that have different abilities and artwork to polish each of its scenes, yet it might be as common for the others to say as it doesn’t stands out to be different or unique. Second, with the help of the music and background sounds it emphasizes the movement and flow of each scene, characters, and effects throughout the show. Lastly, it’s the only thing that this series greatly posses which brings different emotions, CHARACTERS! which is some of them are common, funny, silly, and a source of fan service (just being sarcastic on these, but it’s quite true) that might be the asset of this show. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, my first impression is… speechless. Cannot describe with just words but can conclude that it is a bunch of lame, stereotype, and somehow non-entertaining due to its foolish actions. I’ll say that the other side (enemies) is much better than most of the leading/non-leading characters, but sadly to say, the series just contains a little amount of episodes that will focus more to the abilities of the enemies or maybe to improve the character development. On its way be glad to see some of the leading/non-leading character that puts effort on giving just a little up to big amount of excitement and thrill. Overall, it’s not good neither bad but don’t expect to see some amazingly different from the characters as they move throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Obviously I can’t understand on what elements they’re trying to focus on this series. It seems that because it contains few episodes they convey on and didn’t manage to emphasize the story itself but rather they add some random scenes just to fill it out, However, these kind of scenes didn’t manage to give anything significant to the show rather it’s full of idiocy that brings disappointment as an overall.  I don’t think it’s recommendable with all of its ‘amazing crap’ aspects. If you are curious about it, just try it out and enter the world of foolishness. As soon as you ‘finish’ the 12 episodes you may consider yourself lucky to be out to that world. As for me I’m just curious on how the ending went but sadly to say it’s still the same as where I started.

    Before I watched 11 eyes I did my research and almost every review said that it  was a total let down. Well I stepped up to the challenge and started watching 11 eyes. At first I was like &quot;WHAT! why did everyone say this was bad&quot;? Then halfway through I realized what went wrong...the characters.<br />
<br />
Story 7<br />
Im rating it a 7 based on the actuall story and not how it was made. It was quite intersting I mean it revolves around Kakeru Satsuki the leading male and Yuka Minase, childhood friends who are dragged into a mysterious world named &quot;red night&quot;. In this world there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37961">
        are cratures and powerfull beings that wish to desroy these &#039;fragments&#039;. Finding out they are not the only humans they forge alliances in red night and in the real wold. Each person has a secret power which is slowly discoverd through surviving red night. Now if a better company produced 11eyes and kept it on track then i believe it would deserve an 8 but allas...<br />
<br />
Art 7<br />
Being released in 2009 the animation is still considered quite good. The backgrounds and the lighting used improve the visual experience. Characters look quite good also nothing you would think is &#039;old&#039;.<br />
<br />
Sound 8<br />
The opeing song Arrival of Tears is one that I enjoyed it is a rock style with a sprinkle of mystery in the tune. It builds you up and gets you ready for the action in 11 eyes. The ending is one of my favourite ending songs &quot;sequetia&quot; is also a rock syled but is more energetic and is fitting for the end. The video for Sequetia is very good be sure to check it out.<br />
<br />
Character 5<br />
This I believe is the biggest downfall for 11 eyes. Its not all the characters that are annoying but some change drastically from being loved to thinking &quot;just DIE already!!&quot; Youll know what im talking about if you watch the anime. The development was a tad bit slow and even at the end they all go back to normal as if nothing ever changed.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5<br />
I have to say once i started this anime i was convinced it was going to be a good action anime that i would remember. But now i just think of it as something my brother suggested to me when i was bored (not listening to him again lol). It just barely tweaked my interest and just when you think things are going good it all comes crashing down again. I might sound a bit too harsh but there are postives in 11 eyes such as the action. The fightings scenes were well done its fluid and moves link with one another, not the best I have seen but still good.<br />
<br />
Overall 6<br />
Not one that i would suggeest to anyone unless I knew this was there thing. Be prepared to get annoyed, although I know people that have enjoyed it.<br />
 If you are into action, liked school days (you will know why ;P) and watch anime for the music then 11 eyes would suit you :D.<br />
btw this is my 2nd review (forgot to say it was my 1st on my 1st which was MM!) and I would appreciate and constructive critisims :D.

    Well 11eyes was a big surprise. To be honest just before starting watching it i was critical. The storyline seemed so unorigional and i only watched it becuase i needed something to pass the time and for some unknown reason this kept bugging me for quite some time so i decided to finally watch it.<br />
<br />
It was nothing like i thought. Firstly although the whole idea of another world with chosen warriors with special ability&#039;s to fight and defend their world has been majorly over used,i realised straight away this wasn&#039;t your regular &quot;other world&quot; story. The only unorigional thing i found about the anime was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24630">
        the characters, they were simple characters, stereotypes even of typical anime characters:<br />
<br />
Kakeru- the wannabe knight, pushing himself to be better, fighting for the love of his life<br />
Yuka- Typical big breasted cute, naive girl, who lets her heart rule her (although she does have a very nice unexpected turn around later on)Lots of panty shots. (you know what i dont get anime girls never seem to change their undies)<br />
Misuzu- Serious, mysterious, takes no crap from anybody, proud older girl<br />
Yukiko- (my favourite character; though that may be cause she looks like me and im cosplaying her :P) Petite, bubbly, happy-go-lucky, glass half full, and very into groping i might add (haha she acts like me too)<br />
Takahisa- the bad man! tough guy, street wise with a sad backstory<br />
<br />
the only unorigional character in this was Kukuri the mute girl<br />
<br />
11eyes grabs you at the first episode, the relationship between Yuka and Kakeru (if annoying) is endearing and the slow intorduction of different characters is easy going. I loved the fight scenes (and in my opinion Yukiko kicks serious a*s*e lol but i am slightly bias due to my love of her) and the way the relationship between the main characters gets so deep and close &quot;for friends and for tommorow&quot; and then is totally ripped apart mainly due to the jealousy due to a certain some one; i wont name names *cough* Yuka *Cough getting a love rival *cough*Misuzu*cough*<br />
<br />
The only thing i hate about 11eyes is that it concentrated too much on Kakeru and Yuka&#039;s relationship. If you ask me (and anyone with sense) Yukiko and Takahisa seemed much more in love and their relationship was much more interesting and the spin on their story is so sad and origional it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I think the only improvement could have been to look more at the other characters in detail beside Kakeru, Yuka and Misuzu<br />
<br />
The ending is somewhat confusing and might i mention not what anyone expected, if your planning on watching this my advice is expect the unexpected because this is not your typical bright and happy ending nonsense this is dark stuff dude that is masquerading as something cute and happy.<br />
<br />
11eyes is definately worth a try if your into surprises but i have a feeling its the anime version of marmite; you either love it or you hate it (i love it...though i hate marmite) But luckily you can tell whether you love or hate it within the first episode so its worth a try no matter what. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah not for kids may seem innocent and sweet but later it gets a little bit more mature (scenes of a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slight sexual nature)<br />
<br />
Peace and love people <br />
<br />

    Interesting and dark conception in eroge adaptation. It was suppose to be bloody and mysterious but was shabby and schematic. Anime with wasted potential. <br />
<br />
Satsuki Kakeru lost his sister five years ego. She was his only family. Up till then the stepparents of Yuki Minase, his childhood friend took care of him. And then one day, when Kakeru and Yuki were returning from school, the moon turned red. They arrived to unknown alternative world, full of monsters and no humans. Presently they returned to their own world but they were aware this trip can repeat. When they arrive to the world with red moon again,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50227">
        they meet beings called Black Knights, that want to kill everyone who can travel to other worlds. Yuki and Kakeru along with three other school friends tries to protect themselves from attacks of mysterious beings.<br />
<br />
And again we have an adaptation of eroge. The game “11Eyes” is a visual novel with some gore and sex scenes. The anime isn’t that typical eroge adaptation. We don’t have panties on half of screen. Sometimes pantyshots are shown in unsuitable moments, even in serious moments but it isn’t obtrusive that much. Concerning underwear scenes, there are fanservice situations but they are also important to the whole plot. They develop characters in some way. <br />
<br />
First episodes are really schematic. Teenagers spend their free time in school, try to find some information about the other world. Then the red moon appears and they must fight some monsters and defeat Black Knights. This formula repeat over and over and may be boring for a lot of people. <br />
<br />
All the time we have many uncertainties. This can attract some people. End includes some unexpected twists. Threads that were accepted at first sight are not that obvious. The puzzle which includes questions “Who is the girl in the crystal and why teenagers must safe her?” and “Why do Dark Knights wants to kill the children?”  Only this threads are interesting. The rest is quite boring. <br />
<br />
The story itself isn’t well adapt. The conception is quite interesting: girl from mage family, who uses five legendary katanas; assassin with attractive skills. All this characters with supernatural powers, little girl trapped in the crystal, Dark Knights with quaint design. This could go well. But the authors went wrong somewhere. There are many logic errors and shabby dialogs. The interesting conception was wasted. Instead of that we have teenager who stray over the place with no reason.<br />
<br />
Everyone have some kind of supernatural skills, that helps them to fight the Dark Knights. Characters appears to be interesting at some point but the story doesn’t gave them opportunity to develop. Everything goes so fast, that the advantages can’t be notice. As if the authors want to accommodate everything that was in the game. Characters suddenly appears from nowhere, relocate to another place and we don’t even know when it occur. <br />
 <br />
The character design are similar to that in the game. Pretty manga like faces doesn’t disturb the dark and brutal scenes. The backgrounds are very simple, but the profiles looks detailed. Apparently the anime is more censored compared to game, with erotic scenes as well as bloody moments. <br />
<br />
The music is well selected. When the red moon appears the chorus start to sing and when it’s time for a fight we have faster piece. There are moments with horror like themes but their goal is not to scare but to emphasize the atmosphere . Opening and ending songs are also climatic.<br />
<br />
Regardless “11Eyes” is another wasted potential. It was suppose to be dark and bloody, with little bit mature erotic scenes. Somewhere the authors lost all ideas and it didn’t go well. Well done action anime, too lofty treated, that lead to shabby show. Sometimes it were original and interesting, sometimes boring and trivial.<br />

    Story: It wasn&#039;t very good in my opinion, I was not engaged from beginning to end. Though it was surprising to see two endings which one was bad and the other was a good ending. A bunch of kids trapped in the red night trying to survive by facing the black knights. Didn&#039;t like the fight scenes either.<br />
<br />
Art: The art was pretty decent it wasn&#039;t terrible nor was it very good just very average. <br />
<br />
Sound: The only thing that I enjoyed of this anime was the sound with both op and end theme being good as well as the ost.<br />
<br />
Character: No character stood out in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203878">
        this anime bunch of generic anime teens with supernatural powers that are not exciting to watch. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Nothing on this show makes me want to watch it again. It failed to keep entertain throughout the show. <br />
<br />
Overall: It was one of those shows that you just happened to just past by and never look back to unless for the music other than that this anime gets a 3/10 for me.

    When I watched most of the series, I thought this anime was lacking seriousness.  However, I was proven wrong.  This anime does have action, love (shown in odd, eerie ways), and a couple unexpected plot twists.  The only downer with this show (at least in my opinion) are tiny placements of fan service (yuka&#039;s panty shots, swimsuit scene ODDLY PLACED MAKING ZERO SENSE, yuka&#039;s hideous obsession with the protagonist, Kakeru).  The story itself doesn&#039;t have much of a connection with one of the main characters (I refuse to give any spoilers to those interested) and having watched 10 episodes of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21292">
        series I&#039;m still curious as to how this show will unravel in just the final 2 episodes.  After the series progresses there&#039;s a definite love triangle and the two female characters involved will definitely have to settle it out themselves from some previous scenes I noticed.  Overall, I find this series so far just average because the story isn&#039;t too compelling and the silly connection between modern-day Japan and some Eastern European/Russian ripoff nation called Dracsavania or something like that.  If you like witches, young children fighting Black Knights (which are supposedly the good guys in this story), and silly inserts of Dark-Aged wannabe history, then this anime franchise is up your alley (thankfully this show will be short-lived as it will only span 12 episodes long and will stop airing shortly)!
