    Bad, horrible, disgusting, subpar, generic, and cringey. If you told me to choose one word to define &quot;Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Comedy&quot;, one of those words would probably be the one that I would choose. but that&#039;s not it, there&#039;s much more to why you shouldn&#039;t watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the art, the best quality of this anime which is still a 6 to me. You have moments where the characters look pretty good, especially the eyes, which sure, can be very alluring. But there are also moments that the art is just mega inconsistent, and it makes the characters look like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396311">
        literal shit or just a deformed drawing. To put it simply, the art is not an aspect that would make you like this anime. <br />
<br />
Sound- I really have nothing to say, no outstanding or even good soundtracks to complement the scenes. Op and Ed just decent. Fuck the sound <br />
<br />
Story and character- If anything is boring about this anime, it is the story. You have these horrible and rushed backgrounds, we are told the main character used to be a prodigy in acting. And then the next episode he presents the most cringey dance scene in the history of humanity, and guess what? Guess fucking nothing, cause that&#039;s it, he was a prodigy and now he comes back and blah blah blah blah, fuck off. The drama is just ridiculous, I like you, you like somebody else! So I have to revenge myself!!! Genuinely appalling. <br />
<br />
There will be no enjoyment or pleasure whatsoever if you watch this anime, you might laugh just at how bad it is like I did. If enjoyment is what you are looking for, go ahead and drop this anime right now.<br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
If you want to watch something that will make you punch a wall, that will make you laugh just at how cringey and bad it is, then this anime might be perfect for you. <br />
  <br />
<br />
P.S- Yes, this was a very short review with no constructive takes, but I honestly think even this little review can help you know how bad the anime is.

    A failed attempt at an amazing concept.<br />
<br />
Initially when looking at the shows I was potentially going to watch this Spring 2021 season, this show’s title caught me by the corner of my eye. ‘Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Comedy’ or otherwise known as, ‘Osakmake: The Romcom Where The Childhood Friend Won’t Lose’. Sounds amusingly interesting, right?<br />
<br />
I’m sure everyone who has watched a handful amount of harem type shows has felt the pain of the childhood friend getting surprised sucker punched at the end of the series by another heroine. Osamake’s concept was supposed to be different though: “A romcom where the childhood friend won’t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405700">
        lose!”, is what author, Shuichi Nimaru, thought of when creating this genius idea. Or so we thought.<br />
<br />
Shortly into the series, we learn that all of the heroines are the main protagonist’s childhood friends. Touché. Touché.<br />
<br />
Now with this in mind, the whole concept of a singular childhood friend winning amongst all the other heroines is completely blown out the window. Some would argue that by knowing who the end winner of the series is, it would ultimately be a boring watch. I would argue otherwise. The concept of not knowing who is going to win at the end of the series can be exciting, yes. Cheering on your best girl/guy with other fans of the series can be massively entertaining, yes. The disappointment of that heroine losing or the excitement of seeing them win, is honestly one of the few moments I really appreciate being in this community. But of course, this is only achieved when done correctly. <br />
<br />
Here is the problem with many of these harem series: They try to take this approach, but ultimately end up failing by unnecessarily dragging the series out way too long or in some cases not even giving us a winner at the end. By knowing we have an end winner, we as watchers or readers of the series have closure that a heroine will even be chosen at the end. This concept alone would make a series stand out way more from its competitors. But because of this decision, it makes Osamake just another generic romcom thrown down the rabbit hole of many. <br />
<br />
What happened to getting revenge? This whole revenge aspect was actually something I found to be a pretty interesting concept when initially reading the synopsis. It would’ve been fun and interesting to see a show revolve around the childhood friend and the main protagonist trying to get revenge on the person who rejected him. And by doing so, the childhood friend and the main protagonist slowly grow closer together. Or so I thought this was going to be the case when reading the synopsis.<br />
<br />
The whole ‘revenge’ theme was completely chucked off of the roof as soon as it was introduced. With the recent trend of a lot of new series coming out now, many are starting to overuse this whole ‘revenge’ theme now— most notably, the recent Redo of a Healer. Osamake’s attempt at this shallow theme of revenge was poorly executed and was hardly brushed upon at all. I thought this theme was supposed and going to be built upon more. Heck, even the name of the of the Opening Theme is, “Chance! &amp; Revenge!”. Instead, it was used as a cheap plot device to initially bait the viewer into checking out the series and keep the story going— great.<br />
<br />
Speaking of things that the show introduced, but never mentioned or touched on ever again. Osamake consistently did this, including their main selling point of the love revenge plot. At times they would bring in a major focal point as a cliff hanger, but never mention this point again (i.e. the cooking contest between Maria and Shiro). You may argue that, these scenes just may have happened in the sidelines, but if your going to make something a major point in the episode, heck even the entire anime, wouldn&#039;t you think they would at least give us 5 seconds at the beginning of the next episode to show us that the scene did happen? <br />
<br />
Initially, when looking at the art style and the character designs from the Light Novel, they were actually pretty good in my opinion. On the contrary though, the animation was just really stiff and awkward. A lot of the stills and backgrounds used throughout the 12 episode runtime, was real hard to look at in combination with the very colorful palate used. Many, if not all, of the characters movements throughout the show looked like a PowerPoint presentation, from little things like running towards or grabbing &#039;x&#039; item, to the dance performances they would give.<br />
<br />
I can barely even recall any of the soundtrack used throughout the series, but the Opening Theme, Ending Theme and the insert song used in episode 9 (Paradise SOS) were some pretty catchy songs. I even caught myself re-listening to them a couple times when going out for a morning jog. The voice actors are great, and I&#039;m sure everyone knows and agrees on that at this point. Inori Minase fits perfectly towards Kuro with her gentle and soft spoken voice, yet if needed, can go in the complete opposite direction for a cuter and energetic tone. Ayaneru is known for being able to voice a lot of energetic, soft spoken, cute or cold and sarcastic characters; so Shiro definitely fits her. Ever since Matsuoka Yoshitsugu’s role as Kirito, he has filled a lot of harem protagonist roles. Maru, if not obvious, definitely fits that description. I don’t want to fit every single voice actor, but I think you get the gist at this point.<br />
<br />
Our main protagonist is Maru Sueharu. He is very indecisive most of the time, yet very impulsive when it comes to his emotions. He is also a bit perverted, but who would blame him when he has such pretty girls all over him? He is your average harem protagonist, that the average person would find his actions and mannerisms to be pretty annoying. <br />
<br />
All of the other characters though are as generic and unlikeable as it can be. Kai Tetsuhiko: The main protagonist’s best friend with a painfully obvious foreshadowed secret. Shirokusa Kachi: typical cold exterior with cute insides type character trope. Kuroha Shida: the wannabe onesan. She doesn&#039;t give off that onesan aura at all and in combination with her very aggressive and stubborn personality, she was really hard to listen to at times. Maria Momosaka: The yandere loli, it may surprise you that she was actually one of the better characters too. Rena Asagi: Big boobs #1. Midori Shida: Big boobs #2. Everyone else from this point is barely worth even mentioning and I’m sure you get the gist.<br />
<br />
As much as I hate to use the word cringe, I have to admit that most of the dialogue between characters and their actions were indeed, cringe. All of the lines between the characters made it a really hard watch to actually get through the entire show. The dance performances given looked like they were out of a 2000s pop music video, basically all of Maru&#039;s actions were the definition of cringe, the commercials they filmed were just plain hard to look at, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look I wouldn’t necessarily recommend this show to anyone. There are a lot of other copy pasta shows just like this that are done twenty times better. But for anyone who is looking for a trashy harem to indulge themselves in because they have free time, here is the show for you!<br />
<br />
Although, Osamake is just your average run-of-the-mill harem/romcom show, with a majorly clickbaity title.

    *This review contains spoilers*<br />
<br />
Watching Osamake is an incredibly painful experience. The story is riddled with so many dumb twists and cliches and the characters always act so stupid and nonsensical that sometimes it becomes extremely difficult to sit through a single episode.<br />
<br />
Osamake presents itself as a unique romcom that plays around with various tropes and cliches. The gimmick here is—where the childhood friend archetype in a harem anime usually gets rejected by the protagonist, she won&#039;t be losing in Osamake. There&#039;s surprisingly a clever catch in this, though (probably the most intelligent part of the entire anime), as we later find out that all three

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405694">
        romantic interests of the protagonist are actually his childhood friends. Now, this sounds pretty interesting on paper, but Osamake is unfortunately the very cliche that it attempts to parody—and much worse.<br />
<br />
The protagonist of Osamake&#039;s story is Sueharu Maru, a high school student who is in love with his classmate Shirokusa Kachi, the idol of his school. After saying &quot;Hello&quot; to her a few times (keep this in mind), Sueharu prepares to confess his love to Shirokusa—only to get disheartened when he finds out that she has a boyfriend. But don&#039;t worry, Sueharu&#039;s childhood friend Kuroha has the perfect solution to this situation! What is that solution, you ask? Get revenge on her, of course! What else would it be? That would show her how big of an alpha male you are!<br />
<br />
From then on begins the moronic tale of Sueharu and his equally dull romantic interests, as they make fuss over anything and everything for no goddamn reason—because what&#039;s more entertaining than watching high school students-cum-mentally inept kids do dumb shit?<br />
<br />
It may seem as if I&#039;m exaggerating everything, but that&#039;s pretty much what Osamake is in a nutshell. Nearly all the characters of the show are extraordinarily dumb and childish. They make foolish mistakes on numerous occasions and incessantly cry over them, but instead of learning anything from it, they continue to make those mistakes again and again. Their immaturity doesn&#039;t only show in their actions but also in their speech. The script of the anime is rife with stilted and unnatural dialogues, and some of them are so inane that they remind me of conversations I had in elementary school. Legitimately.<br />
<br />
Our main character Seharu is the typical happy-go-lucky protagonist you would find in any other romcom anime, except that he is much more stupid, shallow, and pathetic. If the first episode wasn&#039;t enough to convince you he is completely brain-dead—don&#039;t worry, he doesn&#039;t take much time to outdo himself.<br />
<br />
Sueharu&#039;s lack of self-awareness and common sense honestly amazes me. He unironically says that he is a genius when he comes up with a plan any elementary school kid could come up with. He questions why others look down on him when he genuinely considered of paying his underclassmen to have sex with her few seconds ago. He claims that he genuinely loves Shirokusa, yet it takes only a couple of weeks for him to fall in love with Kuroha (and vice-versa). All throughout the anime, Sueharu constantly behaves like an oblivious, indecisive pushover who cries over every little thing. His feelings change pretty much every single episode, but most of the times, it&#039;s for the most trivial thing you could imagine.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I didn&#039;t dislike Shirokusa at first. I actually sympathized with her quite a bit—up until a certain point of the story. Like almost everyone else in the anime, it doesn&#039;t take long for her to become annoying. After a while, we get to know that Sueharu used to be Shirokusa&#039;s only friend when she was a child. Because of this, she admired Sueharu and instantly fell in love with him. But before Shirokusa could confess her love, they got separated from each other due to Sueharu&#039;s predicament (which I will get into a bit later). This sounds heartwarming, doesn&#039;t it? But guess what she does when she meets Saeharu again? Instead of confessing to him, she decides it would be better to fake date another guy so that she could make him jealous. Yeah, seriously.<br />
<br />
Kuroha is even worse, though. Her personality is completely detestable right from the beginning. She is usually the one who causes the most trouble and makes the dumbest decisions, yet half the time she behaves like she is totally innocent and blames others for her own idiocy. I&#039;m not saying that Sueharu and Kachi are sensible people by any measure (they are absolutely not, as I have stated and elaborated earlier), but good for them, because some of Kuroha&#039;s actions are a lot more questionable in comparison.<br />
<br />
Halfway through the anime, the author realized that Kuroha doesn&#039;t have any substance to her whatsoever, so they suddenly decide to focus on her. And it&#039;s done in one of the most contrived ways possible. In episode 5, Kuroha decides to fake amnesia and randomly tells everyone that she has lost part of her memories, and everyone just believes her without questioning anything. When asked why she did something like that, she says that she had done it so that she could mend her relationship with Sueharu. If this is not quality writing, I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
Later on, we are introduced to Maria who serves as a younger sister-like character to Sueharu—because what harem would be complete without an overly obsessive imouto? To be fair, Maria is probably the least unlikeable one of the bunch (which isn&#039;t something to be proud of), but she still remains severely underdeveloped as a character. Disregarding the fact that her tough background is brought up completely abruptly, the anime doesn&#039;t bother to properly flesh it out either. It&#039;s implied that her parents abusive and therefore she lives separately with her sister, but it&#039;s never mentioned again.<br />
<br />
When Osamake doesn&#039;t concentrate on its insufferable romance and comedy, it shifts the focus to its forced drama. The overarching plot of the series revolves around the trials and tribulations of working in the acting industry (supposedly), and without a hint of surprise, it&#039;s not well-written either. Now, the concept does have some potential in my opinion (albeit it has been used quite a few times before). The problem with Osamake is that not only does it fail to provide any insight into the filming industry, but it also dumbs everything down to an incredible extent (just like the romance and the comedy). And the fact that the characters are so patently one-dimensional only makes the matter worse.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take Sueharu as an example. At the end of episode 1, it&#039;s suddenly revealed that Sueharu was a renowned actor during his childhood. However, after his mother had passed away due to an unfortunate accident, his acting career was abruptly brought to an end. Later in the anime, Sueharu manages to overcome his trauma and resolves to become an actor again. So, exactly how does he do that? I have no idea. Despite what the series expects us to believe, Sueharu doesn&#039;t face any actual difficulty in confronting his past (except for once in the ENTIRE anime), so there&#039;s exactly zero reason for the viewers to give a shit about him.<br />
<br />
This is no different for any of the other main characters. Due to how carelessly the anime handles its characters&#039; background, their traumas can only be seen as something that is half-assedly thrown in for the sole purpose of adding meaningless &quot;flavor&quot; to their backgrounds—not something that is naturally integrated into their respective personas in order to make each of them substantial. For this reason, all the characters of the show have a painfully overt artificial air to them and make it difficult for them to be taken seriously, a problem which is greatly worsened by their usually idiotic personalities.<br />
<br />
Also, how the hell is Sueharu supposed to be a prodigious actor? Practically everyone around him thinks that he is amazing for some reason, but never once does he manage to validate his overwhelming fame. In fact, his so-called &quot;brilliant acting&quot; is painfully mediocre; there isn&#039;t a single scene in the anime where he performs nearly as good as he is constantly made out to be. In the confession festival, he does this awkward Fortnite dance or whatever, and I kid you not, it&#039;s easily one of the cringiest things I have ever watched. Everyone in the anime apparently thinks it&#039;s amazing, though, and I have absolutely no clue as to why.<br />
<br />
As for the other significant characters, there aren&#039;t any besides Tetsuhiko (I&#039;ll talk about him in a while). All the other side characters are treated as complete fodders who are simply there to heighten the idiotic drama, obsess over Sueharu for whatever reason and resolve plot points whenever it is convenient. I wouldn&#039;t have complained about this that much if the said characters were at least bearable, but it seems like the author only knows how to make them obnoxious. By the end of the anime, I ended up disliking pretty much all of the characters either due to how bland or unlikeable they were. And seriously, what&#039;s the purpose of those gorilla-looking guys? Could they be more punchable?<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about Tetsuhiko now, shall we? Tetsuhiko looks awfully identical to Yakiatsu from AnoHana, and their personalities are actually similar too—if you completely remove the depth of Yakiatsu and only keep the smartass attitude. Tetsuhiko is that one annoying playboy character that you see in many romance anime, and the fact that he takes up a sizeable portion of the anime doesn&#039;t help in this regard. Despite his overbearing presence in the series, Tetsuhiko is far from being a fleshed out character. We are suddenly told that he actually a significant reason behind why he is starting up a film club, but the author completely forgets about it the second he introduces it. What could have been an interesting subplot is quickly vanished into thin air, and Tetsuhiko remains an obnoxious smartass.<br />
<br />
One argument fans use against Osamake&#039;s criticisms is that it&#039;s supposed to be a parody of typical romcom/harem anime, so we shouldn&#039;t be taking the series at face value. Here&#039;s the problem, though—Osamake is far from an actual parody. And even if we pretend that it is one, it&#039;s definitely not good at it. Here&#039;s what I mean.<br />
<br />
To make a genuinely entertaining parody, first you have to establish that you are being self-aware. There&#039;s no need to be blatant to about it; you simply have to make it apparent or discernible. Then you have to make the parodies clever and unexpected in a way they don&#039;t seem forced and/or provide some sort of insight. Likeable characters are also very important depending on what kind of story we are handling. If it&#039;s a romcom anime for example, you have to make the characters somewhat likeable given they are pretty much the driving force of your show.<br />
<br />
Osamake doesn&#039;t have any of that. The series claims that it&#039;s parodying basic tropes and cliches, but then proceeds to use those exact tropes and cliches as a serious plot device. There&#039;s almost never any sense of irony in the unbelievably awkward events that occur, and even when there is, it doesn&#039;t make the anime any better due to how unlikeable the characters are. Sometimes, Osamake tries to justify it being self-aware by showing satirical third-person perspectives of the romance storyline, but they are always so blatant and uninteresting that it only makes the series more pretentious.<br />
<br />
The production side of Osamake is by far its best aspect, and that&#039;s saying something when the said aspect is mediocre at best. The quality of the animation is mostly okay, but unfortunately it worsens drastically from time to time. Sometimes, the characters look like they are deformed or something, and other objects seem abnormal as well. And can I talk about how awful their classroom looks? Seriously, why the hell does it look so gloomy? Can&#039;t you guys buy some damn lights at least?<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is satisfactory. The background tracks are surprisingly pretty good, and while the opening is very annoying, the ending isn&#039;t that bad. The voice actors are actually amazing; they pretty much singlehandedly carry the entire show. Some of the not-so-cringey scenes were surprisingly enjoyable solely because of the competent voice actors. Their voices were irritating to listen to sometimes, but that&#039;s because their assigned characters are crap to begin with. If the voice acting had been garbage as well, I would have had a much harder time sitting through this shitfest.<br />
<br />
Osamake encompasses everything that is wrong with the romcom genre; it&#039;s an utter failure of a romcom anime. The comedy is painfully unfunny, the romance is incredibly obnoxious, and the drama has less depth than the puddle of water in my backyard. As much of a trainwreck Domestic na Kanojo was and will be, at least it succeeded at keeping me constantly entertained. Osamake isn&#039;t capable of providing that kind of entertainment either, though. At best, it&#039;s a painfully generic romcom anime; at worst, it&#039;s an egregiously written pretentious garbage devoid of almost any enjoyment value.

OsaMake is Rick and Morty of the Spring 2021 anime season. Meaning, high-culture intellectual entertainment that you need a creative writing diploma to fully appreciate, which gets jeered at by plebeians incapable of forming independent thoughts after they saw that one copypasta, as they remain blissfully unaware that it was written as a self-deprecating joke by a show’s fan - since recognizing satire is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405707">
        beyond their mental capabilities.<br />
<br />
Okay, it’s actually not like Rick and Morty at all, I just wanted to do a bit. Rick and Morty is all about narratology concepts, such as the monomyth, OsaMake is a genre parody that exists solely within the context of one specific genre. What it’s really like is The Naked Gun. The Naked Gun only fully makes sense for a viewer that has seen at least several 80s cop dramas, without the context of those it looks like lolrandom gibberish. In a way, it’s an audience-participation program - in order to work on the intended level, it requires the audience to add their own knowledge of police procedural tropes to what the show itself is presenting. Likewise, OsaMake only fully works if you’ve seen at least several [dozen] high school harem romcoms. Take the most obvious thing about it - the full title. If you’re familiar with at least Nisekoi, it’s obvious that the joke is gonna be that every heroine (seven and counting) is a childhood friend, if you’re not - that joke is lost on you. And before even that, you need to watch at least three anime romcoms of any kind to establish the pattern that childhood friends losing is a thing and it indeed holds some meaning to announce in your series’ title that the childhood friend won’t lose here. And that’s the very basics of the basics, OsaMake&#039;s entire substance is dicking around with romcom tropes, big and small. Like the lines I’ve put into the epigraph - they’re a twist on the classic romcom exchange, “what do you like about me?” - “I like everything about you.” Or when the resident Ice Queen Bitch #177013 (Haruhi/Senjougahara/Yukinon clone) does a classic Shaft head tilt while spouting verbal abuse - the show expects the audience to recognize an overt reference to Senjougahara. Without exaggeration, I can list hundreds of similar examples, the entire story is constructed to be a vehicle for such meta-comedy.<br />
By the way, the actual joke of the show’s full title is that it’s a lie - OsaMake is not even a romcom in the technical sense. Watching it to see if your favorite heroine will “win” in the end is like watching Evangelion to see if giant robots will defeat aliens in the end. No one will “win.” No, I don’t literally know what the finale of the story will be - but I have enough media literacy to know what the story is about, and it’s not about that.<br />
<br />
Well, so far I’ve established that the series is a parody of high school romcom anime. Whether it’s a good parody or not is an entirely different matter. First, ask yourself what’s the worst thing a parody of anything can do? The worst thing a parody can do is to play the cliches it’s supposed to be parodying completely straight, while doing cringy wink-and-nod 4th wall breaks, “we’re totally self-aware that we’re doing a dumb cliche, aren’t we clever?” OsaMake is a good parody because it avoids doing that, opting instead for something genuinely clever. Its characters are not aware that they are *literally* inside of a romcom series, but they are aware of what kind of things happen in romcoms, just as any target audience member would be. It’s like... you know how every trashy zombie movie seems to take place in a universe where zombie movies do not exist? And when the zombie outbreak happens, their characters are utterly baffled by these mysterious walking creatures and how to deal with them, which takes away all the suspension of disbelief? And on the contrary, if those characters try to test whether their zombies react to loud sounds and die to headshot - they appear more sensible and relatable? This is how OsaMake characters are written, they are people from a universe where anime romcoms exist. Sometimes this is utilized for comedy - the Ice Queen doesn’t actually have the Ice Queen personality. She is a dork that learned social interactions from light novels and happens to have long straight hair - so she [mistakenly] thinks that larping Senjougahara makes her more attractive. Sometimes this is utilized for drama - when the Capital “C” Childhood Friend discovers she has a romantic rival, she consciously uses her childhood friend status to advance her relationship with her love interest. E.g. she plays up their friendship by offering herself as a trusted confidant, brings up all the history they have together, gets physically intimate under the pretense of skinship, etc. You know, like a real girl trying to “win” her romance would do, not like a moe doormat that rolls over and dies because her archetype demands her to be nice. <br />
And this is just one aspect of how OsaMake’s writing is above your generic romcom level. It’s full of subtlety, properly conveyed subtext, clever allusions, Nisio-Isin-style banter, interesting relationship dynamics, absurdist humor, foreshadowing with eventual pay-offs, non-verbal storytelling, and all the other usual suspects of filtering out the audience that does not look at the screen while watching anime. Why does the Ice Queen berate boys as perverts for looking at her very own gravure photoshoot? Because she is a clueless dork doing a larp. Why is the protagonist monologuing to himself and doing dramatic poses? Because he is a former star actor. Why does he insult a girl by comparing her to Commodore Perry’s black ships? Because it makes sense in the context of their relationship. One of the ways I evaluate my personal enjoyment of any series is how “densely packed” with content it is - how long does it take me to finish an episode counting all the pauses necessary to mentally process the intaken information - and every episode of OsaMake took me an hour - because there’s just so much stuff to note and analyze. It’s one of the most intellectually challenging series I’ve seen in years. Doesn’t mean one of the best ones, simply being hard to parse isn’t the same as being good (nor does it imply having any “deep” messages), but it’s a niche show that aims to be entertaining in a very specific way and succeeds in doing that with flying colors.<br />
In conclusion, OsaMake *is* similar to Rick and Morty after all - in a sense that the more you know about storytelling devices (and the more effort you put into looking at the screen), the more fun you can find in it.<br />

9.5/10 for “genre spoof done right.”<br />

If i could summaries this show with one sentence, it would be that<br />
<br />
lets go with the obvious things,<br />
<br />
 Story:<br />
when i looked over the anime that will be release this season, i usually picked the one that interest me. by what i mean, is i look over their poster because i like to watch my anime blindly. so the first ep of this show just make me facepalm so hard since it defies logic ( well for me anyway ) how could u reject someone infront of a class and not get embarrassed. the funny thing is  kuro still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405698">
        likes the dude i mean wth lmao. now, lets go to the actual story that ive gathered from this show. its a abt a boy name sueharu, a child actor that retired from acting due to personal reason, and follows him as he tries to pick which of his &#039;childhood friend&#039; to be his lover. yup, thats it. there&#039;s nothing to the story itself like im so confuse to the point i dont even care when im watching the episodes. The story makes no sense since its literally in their title &#039;Romcom Where The Childhood Friend Won&#039;t Lose&#039; and guess what all the girls are his childhood friends. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
i mean it was okay but i do like the dance tho ( it was a pathetic attempt btw ) <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I dont even remember if they add sounds to their episodes...<br />
<br />
Charaters:<br />
<br />
my god, the characters are just flat and dont even have a reason to why they liked this dude, i could go on but u get the point...<br />
the only character i liked i guess is tetsuhiko. why i liked him.... no reason really i think his cool. Other than that, theres nothing to talk abt them since i didnt even care abt their existence, how can i liked them when the show just throws us many random characters &#039;supposedly&#039; to be his childhood friend . <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Dont watch this anime. i do recommend for ppl that like to experience bad anime hahaha. Bottom line, i hate this anime since the show didnt even know what they want to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah.... what ever happened to their cooking contest? i guess plothole lmao.... what a show

    If you like Quintessential Quintuplets, you might like this anime for (only) one reason: the VAs!<br />
Fuutaro and the mc of this anime have the same VA, Kachi (black hair) and Yotsuba have the same VA, and Shida (gold hair) and Itsuki have the same VA. To me, this is a big bonus since Yotsuba and Itsuki were some of my favorite characters in Quints, and Fuutaro’s VA has such a unique voice, so being able to hear them again is very appealing. Some might argue that this a generic or poorly executed romcom, but for now, I still think that the show has a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396281">
        of potential and could turn into a decent romcom. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
Creative story. The story is based on a fairly unique idea and expands it in a surprisingly good way. There are lots of interesting twists that you might not expect. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Decent art for 2021. Art is appealing to the eyes and enhances the experience.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Great sound for a 2021 anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
The three main characters are very well described and unique. However, we do not know much about them yet.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
The perfect combination of dynamic plot, well-niched characters, and good eye/ear candy makes for an enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Recommended if you are just looking for an enjoyable anime and something a little different.<br />
<br />
tl:dr; Original plot was developed in probably the best way. Definitely enjoyable to a wide range of people.<br />

    I didn’t bother before to write any reviews, but after the fourth episode of this I feel like I want to share my opinion.<br />
<br />
So first of all the basic idea of the Story, Sound and Art are average in my opinion. It might have been enjoyable, if elaborated better.<br />
<br />
Sadly this Anime is ruined by the Characters and their (unlogic) way of acting also by certain events that just make the whole thing cringey (like the dance, confessions, rejections, amnesia).<br />
The character interactions are so poor and the dialogue is kinda forced.<br />
<br />
So far this was a huge waste of time.<br />

    Osanajimi is a nice little rom-com this season that probably stands out a lot more compared to the &quot;weirder&quot; rom-coms we have airing like Nagatoro, Koikimo and Higehiro. That being said, Osananajimi isn&#039;t without its flaws and it falls a bit short of where it could have been.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
The story is a bit unique compared to the generic rom-com formula: it&#039;s centred around the idea of your first love being your most genuine love and something you don&#039;t wanna lose. This leads to the various revenge plots we saw unfolding in the first 3 episodes. <br />
<br />
While the premise is good, the execution was a bit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396304">
        subpar. Exposition and conversations were a bit hard to follow at times, especially the interaction between Kachi and Maru in the infirmary wing. I read the first few chapters of the manga and it was a lot clearer what tf was going on there. Hopefully, these were just anomalies and won&#039;t hinder the series going forward.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I like the cutesy, bright art style. It&#039;s nice. But the animation for the dances and stuff in EP 3 was pretty subpar. I know, I know, the budget probably isn&#039;t as high or the team isn&#039;t as dedicated to the project compared to smth like Kaguya Sama, but it doesn&#039;t change the fact the dancing was very jittery and didn&#039;t flow well.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
A lot of the voice actors are the same ones from Quintessential Quintuplets, so that&#039;s loads of fun. The OP and ED are also quite good, and I&#039;m a fan of the background music/OSTs too.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Big respect to Maru for not being a pussy ass bitch MC in a harem anime. Was the way he suddenly overcame his trauma a bit clutch and underdeveloped? Maybe. But I don&#039;t think it was terrible either.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, they &quot;fit&quot; their tropes pretty well, but most importantly, we don&#039;t have no pussy ass bitches for the girls. They&#039;re all direct in their feelings towards Maru, and that helped the series naturally progress to where it is now 4 episodes in. It&#039;ll be interesting to see how character development goes down in the future.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Overall, Osananajimi is an enjoyable watch for me. I don&#039;t (overly) cringe at moments in this anime, and it&#039;s got a fair share of jokes and gags that crack a smile. It&#039;s a solid rom-com that isn&#039;t too cliche, and considering how everything has developed and progressed so far, I sure hope it stays that way and doesn&#039;t suddenly hit the brakes.

    To understand how the anime community got from the awkward HenSuki, then strong OreSuki to the ass-pull OsaMake (this show), here are 2 excerpts of the interview between Joey The Anime Man and novelist Rui Tsukiyo, the author of Redo of Healer:<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me give you a common scenario: You have a woman crazed with jealousy. She corners the protagonist and forces him to sexually assault her. Doesn&#039;t that say that you...that women love r**e? Conversely, the genre women hate the most is the harem love-comedy style (that&#039;s) filled with women fawning over the protagonist and softcore fanservice. According to my research, thes shows appeal to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405703">
        very few women. When heroines fawn over the protagonist, I have a feeling that&#039;s a deal breaker for most female viewers. But I only realized this after the fact.&quot; This self-research really shows that only males will like this show, and a few females who are OK with the harem rom-com style.<br />
<br />
This excerpt however, hits home to why this show sucks BALLS (Rui Tsukiyo was mentioning how he got motivated to write Redo of Healer):<br />
&quot;I deliberately wrote something that I thought would sell well. There is a site called Syosetu where users can upload their writing, and many of the top-ranking submissions of the site were revenge stories. Since they were popular and I like them, I thought I&#039;d write my own. But those stories are very weak, they kept talking about revenge...but after like 2 or 3 chapters, the revenge part is over. And then it just turns into the story of an OP protag with a harem.&quot; AND GUESS WHAT, Rui Tsukiyo IS DAMN SPOT ON, as such we&#039;re seeing with OsaMake, the scapegoat to a common trend.<br />
<br />
And folks, even if you like or dislike Rui Tsukiyo for writing the controversial Redo of Healer, you can&#039;t deny that he is a very calculative guy who knows how to buck the trend in a wise manner. And his pointers are especially damning to this seemingly &quot;newbie&quot; author that is Shuichi Nimaru, who did 2 short LNs between 2011 and 2014 before assuming a &quot;long hiatus&quot; before creating OsaMake in 2019, and popular it did get in Japan, scoring 5th in Takarajimasha&#039;s Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! (This Light Novel Is Amazing!) list in 2020, and sales of the LN are still soaring in the Top 10 as of the time of this review. Honestly though, this is a surprise given that Japan is lukewarm to the harem rom-com genre&#039;s successions of staleness, to which Western anime fans like us have long been complaining that this kind of genre has seen a lot of derivatives and deviations to the point of endless mediocrity. OsaMake though, drives just one point of just bearing the absolute r**e-fest of a cringe show that can be summed up in one word: PATHETIC.<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve been through a hell lot of rom-com stories like these in recent years, heck I&#039;d say that for every legit decent-to-good rom-com show like OreSuki, BokuBen, 5-toubun no Hanayome a.k.a. Quintessential Quintuplets, or even reverse-harem ones like Hamefura a.k.a Otome Game, there are at least a few bad iterations like it, both in anime and source material form. OsaMake truly stands on the opposite spectrum as one of the modern popular works with a shit-load kind of plot that only serves to degrade its overarching story by cramping in as much of the features that even hardcore harem rom-com fans like us DO NOT WANT to see, but yet it did in its shameless subservient form. If this is the standard going forward for new manga or LN harem rom-com series, I&#039;m sorry to say that &quot;new&quot; authors like Shuichi Nimaru have only found a formula to earn them food on their table for a living, while bringing absolutely nothing new nor groundbreaking in the stymied genre that once you saw one, you&#039;ve seen one many times over.<br />
<br />
Prodgies, and very specifcally, revenge. We&#039;ve seen this kind of plot play so many times over, it doesn&#039;t feel like I&#039;m being that type of weeb who likes OP characters, especially &quot;child prodgies&quot; that earn a cult reputation and being chased after fans, only except that in OsaMake&#039;s case, they live next to you as a childhood friend! And guess what? As if the lovey-dovey sense of the childhood friend isn&#039;t enough, the MC&#039;s line of work has also earned him the attention of the girls whom have worked with him since young, that are now trying to take a piece of this weak-ass MC&#039;s &quot;virginity&quot;. Guys, this male MC called Sueharu Maru, is nothing more than your average generic guy who only has enough &quot;drama&quot; in his life just to be &quot;intertwined in the red thread of fate&quot; of girls that are same age or even younger, to have an admiration for him. To be rejected in love by one of his past female &quot;friends&quot;, that is now a prominent figure in the industry, this girl who goes by the name of Shirokusa Kachi, with her lush demeanor and bright presence, she is a &quot;force&quot; to be reckoned with. OK, so what&#039;s the solution? Bring in your good ol&#039; childhood frend: Kuroha Shida, to help you out with your so-called revenge, while she still harbours romantic feelings for you since young! Yes, that&#039;s right, now you see why this is the rom-com that the childhood friend will not lose! This supposedly love &quot;triangle&quot; (which constantly evolved as the female count goes higher) is in all: one painful experience to watch, let alone experience.<br />
<br />
If I have to match the character cast that&#039;s similar to a movie, it&#039;d be Snow White and the 7 Dwarves, or in the case of OsaMake: Dumb Black and the 7 Thirsty Sisters. Sueharu&#039;s VA Yoshitsugu Matsuoka is a staple in rom-coms, as is Kuroha&#039;s VA Inori Minase and Shirokusa&#039;s VA Ayane Sakura. With the inclusion of yet another girl in the love &quot;rectangle&quot; mix: VA Saori Oonishi (SaeKano&#039;s Eriri Sawamura) voicing Maria Momosaka, no doubt in my mind that the VAs are definitely the best part about this show, and just like every harem rom-com, I can tell that the VAs are definitely having fun while recording their lines for this show. Unsurprisingly, this is about as far as my praise would get, because everything else is tacked-on appalling, and don&#039;t even think about trying to defend this dense-less density of a show that&#039;s weaker than cooking oil to burn the flames even greater than imagined. I&#039;ll admit that if there is one thing that Shuichi Nimaru can get it right, is naming his characters, which are references to characters in Fire Emblem: Sueharu (Marth), Kuroha (Sheeda), Shirokusa (Catria), Tetsuhiko (Cain) and Maria (obviously Maria) respectively. Even Kuroha (black wing), Shirokusa (white dress) and (Maria) Momosaka (pink hill)&#039;s names include colors.<br />
<br />
Ready to see who I&#039;ll label everyone as such? Here goes:<br />
- Sueharu Maru is the abridged Snow White&#039;s Dumb-and-Dumber Black<br />
- Tetsuhiko Kai is the Prince (just because I hate all girls who tries to win Sueharu&#039;s heart) <br />
- Kuroha Shida is Grumpy<br />
- Shirokusa Kachi is Bashful<br />
- Maria Momosaka is Happy<br />
- Rena Asagi is Dopey<br />
- Midori Shida is Sneezy<br />
- Aoi Shida is Sleepy<br />
- (Last but not least) Akane Shida is Doc<br />
<br />
Maru Sueharu is very apt as I call him Dumb Black because he doesn&#039;t know how to read his situations nor give solutions to circumstances. Instead, everything is hell-bent reliant on the best friend chad that is Tetsuhiko Kai, who does the in-between jobs for him like how a personal manager would be accounting to a former child star. It always makes me wonder who&#039;s playing the actual MC role here, and at more times than not, Tetsuhiko is like playing the &quot;Prince Charming&quot; or the dwarves&#039; &quot;Doc&quot; role here to literally kiss the MC&#039;s butt and suck up to his shortcomings. For the girls, honest-to-God I&#039;ve tried to have a better comparison for the background girls (especially Kuroha&#039;s 4 sisters), but for the 3 central girls Kuroha, Shirokusa and Maria, there&#039;s no mistaking their roles for how much screentime they got to eschew the living hell out of this child prodigy that&#039;s all talk but no action. This type of harem exists everywhere, but the execution here sucks my balls dry, not hard. One thing&#039;s for sure, this is not a Snow White kind of story that is a modernized classic fairy tale in the imitation space.<br />
<br />
Doga Kobo&#039;s production animation...sure seems wonky for a harem rom-com type of show. It seems to me as if there&#039;s a disconnect between the character designs and the visuals, which often come to me as 2 different byproducts that don&#039;t seem to mesh well together. Granted, slice-of-life shows is the studio&#039;s consistent bread-and-butter (and you can definitely feel a Doga Kobo show that way), but in recent times, going experimental with difference of styles from the magic fantasy that is Maoujou de Oyasumi, to the dark and depressing mystery drama that is Ikebukuro West Gate Park, it seems as though like it&#039;s etching its thematics like another studio (Ajia-Do). I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s wrong to try out of the comfort zone, but you can definitely feel the difference in production (that&#039;s not necessarily a departure).<br />
<br />
Even the OST here really is so-so levels of decent. I really admire Riko Azuna&#039;s charmly voices when her songs are chosen for either OP or ED, but while OsaMake definitely feels like her normal rhetorical self, I&#039;ve gotta admit that the peppy OP is kinda boring. Compare that to Spider Isekai and Yagate Kimi ni Naru a.k.a Bloom Into You&#039;s OP (which the latter is still by far the best beautiful song she&#039;s ever written), and it feels like a step down in quality. Overtime as time passes, character-centric EDs are sounding more mediocre, as much as I can give a thumbs up to the VAs who collaborate together for A+ effort, I can&#039;t say as much that it really does get old rather fast and for good reason.<br />
<br />
Should I say that I feel disappointed by what OsaMake tries to &quot;be something different&quot;? Apparently not, just find any word that rhymes with the prescriptive words of &quot;bad&quot;,&quot;cliché&quot;, or even &quot;cringe&quot; as hell, and associate it with this bastardized harem rom-com of a show. Mark my words that this excruciating experience of a sleazy showing is absolutely not worth your time, and don&#039;t even think of starting this one.

    I&#039;m starting to see a pattern on this site that pisses me off: people give shows that don&#039;t have fighting and over-the-top characters in them a low score and call them cringe. There is a 15-yo guy who calls this disgusting... and still have no idea what the fuck he means by that.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t see how this show is any cringe. It&#039;s your regular awkward romcom with wholesome-harem-tropes. It&#039;s not a hentaifest filled with boobs and fanservice, wich a lot of elitist on this site expect romcoms to be.<br />
<br />
Rant over, review time:<br />
This show is what I&#039;ve been waiting for quite some time: another awkward highschool

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397514">
        romcom. Is it overdone? Yes. Is that a problem? No! I like shows like this and I&#039;m more than certain that a lot of people like it as well.<br />
<br />
The art is great. It&#039;s what you expect from a romcom and it&#039;s good to your... eyes? It&#039;s just good artwork and animation, no complaints.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m someone who never skips intro&#039;s if it&#039;s a banger, and this show&#039;s opening is one that I skip. It&#039;s not bad, but it&#039;s not memorable. Sounds, ambience, music &amp; voices are fine, also no complaints.<br />
<br />
I like how they immediately go into the story. There is little buildup, no transfer-student-clichés. Just straight to the point. The characters&#039; personalities are clear from the get-go (or is it?) and you know what you can expect (or do you?).<br />
<br />
The show is enjoyable, as cliché as a lot of the scenes are. Romcom clichés never get old, and it&#039;s always fun to see what they do with certain cliché-situations (for example: locked-up-with-girl-in-a-small-space, main-girl-sees-that-mc-has-supposedly-girl-over,...).<br />
<br />
It might look like it&#039;s really rushed and the pacing is like a bullet-train, but after episode 3 the story only BEGINS. Give it a try, the name of the show is chosen very careful and smart.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re not into romantic comedy shows, just let this one pass. Every site I visit that talks about this show has a comment section filled with crybabies complaining about it being &#039;another cringe harem&#039;. Well, I react the same to every new braindead-ninja-action-show, but I don&#039;t whine about it on every episode. Just don&#039;t watch it if you don&#039;t like the genre. It&#039;s almost the exact same as going to a McDonalds, buying/eating everything from the menu and then complain it isn&#039;t vegan, while still ordering more.

    I have NEVER hated an anime as much as I do this one. I dreaded seeing the notification that a new episode was released. I felt obligated to watch this. Silly me for having high hopes. The characters are bland, dumb and overall just generic. I cared so little for all the characters and the piss poor story. I literally couldn&#039;t remember what happened minutes after watching this. <br />
<br />
I like harems: Love Hina, shuffle, Haganai, Oresuki.<br />
<br />
Heck, I even like trashy harems like Kissxsis and Hensuki.<br />
<br />
BUT THIS... this was bad. Like REALLY bad.<br />
<br />
Save yourself the trouble and don&#039;t watch this. There&#039;s nothing redeeming about this anime.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Osamake is meant to be a romcom harem, but the comedy ain&#039;t great as well as the story itself. The only reason why I laugh while watching is because of how shitty it is. <br />
<br />
Story - 3/10<br />
<br />
The story, in my opinion did have potential when you realize all the girls are his childhood friends. But, it can be rushed or have scenes that don&#039;t make sense. For example: Shida (the first girl in line) wanted Maru to herself. She had confessed her love to him, but he rejected. Then a few episodes later, Maru confessed to Shida IN FRONT OF A WHOLE

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398104">
        CROWD AND SHE REJECTED HIM FOR REVENGE TO LATER REGRET IT!? Up until this point, the show was probably a 6/10 for my taste. The story just gets weird after this. Shida is supposed to have amnesia? Like what?<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
<br />
The art style can be enjoyable to look at. It can just be very inconsistent, and can look weird at times. The eyes can bother me at times. Other than that it&#039;s fine, I&#039;ve seen worse.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
<br />
The opening is pretty solid but not memorable.<br />
<br />
The ending is actually pretty nice and cute, but then again not memorable. <br />
<br />
The voice actors/actresses are great! I have no complaints with that.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6/10<br />
<br />
Maru : <br />
He is your usual unremarkable protagonist. Maru used to be a actor when he was a child, and his mother died on set. He does some cringey dance and the girls fall for him more? I really don&#039;t understand this show.<br />
<br />
Shida : <br />
Shida is the first girl introduced to the harem, and is a childhood friend of Maru. At first, I really liked her! She is the kind of girl who believes in revenge. However, she rejects the guy on the spot when he confessed his love to her. It pissed me off when she did that since she reallly liked him and had the fcking audacity to reject him.<br />
<br />
Kachi/Shiro : <br />
Kachi enhanced her looks to catch Maru&#039;s attention since she holds a fcking grunge on him as a child not coming back to her house for a playdate. It&#039;s hella stupid. She even pretended to be dating the popular guy at the school to make Maru jealous. <br />
<br />
Momosaka :<br />
A loli who keeps calling Maru &quot;Onii Chan&quot;. I personally don&#039;t like when loli&#039;s are included in the harem bc it feels weird to watch. Momosaka has also had a crush on Maru. So far she has done nothing stupid yet, so I haven&#039;t gotten frustrated at her. I only don&#039;t like her that she calls him Onii Chan and suggests about him doing &quot;things&quot; to her in the past. The vibe can be weird when she is on the screen at times. It can make me feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6/10 <br />
<br />
Since its a terrible anime, I can&#039;t help but laugh and this ridiculous story. I will continue watching since it just makes me laugh because of how cringey it is.<br />
<br />
Overall - 4/10<br />
<br />
If you are new to romcom animes, don&#039;t watch this. This will definitely give you the wrong impression. Some enjoyable romcom/harems I suggest :<br />
Kaguya Sama: Love is War , Rent a Girlfriend , The Quintessential Quintuplets , Toradora , Ouran High School Host Club , and Don&#039;t Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro.   <br />

    Slight spoilers for the first few episodes incoming.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
Osamake deals with the theme of love triangles, a staple of rom-coms of its kind, and revenge, and executes them in an original lively manner, remaining true to its comedic gripes throughout its episodes. The title serves as bait to get away from the overused trope of the childhood friend losing to the new transfer student, though this is short-lived, as we are jebaited as we learn that both main girls are his childhood friends (lol). Also gives me some Oresuki vibes, so be sure to check this out if you enjoyed that!<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
This is probably the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396401">
        biggest issue I&#039;ve seen with the series so far. Despite the animation being fine for the most part, there are some major letdowns (looking at you, Sueharu&#039;s dance in ep. 3) and some telltale signs of lazy animating which make me contemplate if some parts of certain episodes were animated by a group who&#039;d never looked at the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
No complaints, the OP/ED are both cutesy and fun to listen to!<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
The characters in Osamake are enjoyable to watch, and their quirks and interactions with each other are entertaining, and often hilarious, with the animosity between Kuro and Shiro being a clear example of this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 9<br />
<br />
All of the above factors, bar the animation, make Osamake a delightful watch, and I definitely recommend you to add this to your Spring 2021 watchlist!

    This is actually my first MAL review, but I felt this one was necessary so as to save unknowing victims from the pain of having to experience this anime for themselves. <br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
<br />
Initially, the plot follows an outstandingly generic, yet relatively bearable MC as he chases the attention of the girl of his dreams. Upon meeting a potential romantic rival, our protagonist teams up with his childhood friend who also happens to be a lusty female, in order to exact romantic revenge and win the girl of his dreams. Sounds stupid, but it actually turns into a decently amusing love triangle situation which had me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402923">
        fully invested and cringing in the best way possible after witnessing some of the awkward yet gripping situations MC found himself in. <br />
Unfortunately, the excitement is short lived as the romantic narrative is forced to a stalemate and the plot detours to a weak, clichéd, and extremely unrealistic celebrity story about child actors and TV commercials. It becomes borderline unbearable to watch as the main character&#039;s love triangle quickly morphs into a love octagon. Story gets a 3/10 solely for the entertainment factor of the first few episodes, otherwise it might be a 1/10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about the art, really. It&#039;s pretty average, but I&#039;m more of a plot guy so it doesn&#039;t really bother me. The main cast of characters all look decently appealing and the colours pop, but if you&#039;re someone who is susceptible to the occasionally jarring instances of poorly implemented CG or prolonged still shots, the art may leave a bitter taste. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t long into the show that I began to notice the painfully obvious overuse of the same few music tracks in almost every single episode. The tracks themselves aren&#039;t terrible, but they&#039;re weak enough that they get pretty annoying after hearing them for the third time in one episode. If you told me that they paid someone on fiverr to write the score for this show, I&#039;d almost feel inclined to believe you. I think that speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
<br />
Much like the plot itself, the characters really begin to show their cracks after the first initial story arc. Some characters make extreme decisions haphazardly and then wallow in their consequences, while other characters spectate these events and are seemingly able to comprehend and analyse their obscene lack of reasoning. The most believable character is the MC, and I only say that because he spent as much time being a confused wreck as I did while I was watching, so at least I didn&#039;t feel alone in my suffering. <br />
All jokes aside, the characters suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
<br />
I had fun watching the first few episodes, but the show has quickly become stale to the extreme throughout its progression. My score for enjoyment reflects the short-lived innocence I felt before my expectations were brutally subverted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
<br />
Unless you&#039;re doing a collectathon run of every RomCom anime in existence, I can&#039;t recommend watching this. Even then, I&#039;d suggest getting it out of the way as early as possible so as to save yourself the pain of having to compare it to any other half decent show from the genre (of which there are many). <br />
<br />
The final verdict: <br />
<br />
This is an anime for masochists and genre completionists only. All other weak-bodied individuals who attempt to watch this show may risk sudden death via spontaneous combustion. <br />
<br />

    Ill just get to the point its one of the most boring romcom&#039;s i have ever seen, the animation is horrible e.g, when looking at the movements of the characters it looks too robotic i.e just open an episode and look at their hand movements,  it is clear that the drawers and animators have not put any effort at all into making it. <br />
The reaction scenes are &quot; i don&#039;t know what to say about it&quot; and i don&#039;t blame the voice actors they really did a good job, but the as i have said before the animators did not take this seriously, i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400585">
        believe they had a limited time span and a lack of funds but still decided to make it. Thus, creating this &quot;THING&quot;.<br />
I thought it would get better with time as most anime the starting episodes don&#039;t turn out how the creators wanted it to but sadly even after 8 episodes nothings changed.<br />
I don&#039;t know how its light novel is doing but after this I hope it does not get a bad reputation because of the studio  Doga Kobo who didn&#039;t do their job.

    Spoiler Alert *<br />
I&#039;ll pass about all the girls, childhood friends ....<br />
Let&#039;s get to the point<br />
Mc don&#039;t have brain and I think it&#039;s undisputed. Mc loves &#039;&#039; Shiro &#039;&#039; but confess &#039;&#039; Kuro &#039;&#039; this is ridiculous. I&#039;ll be more understanding because it&#039;s harem so it can&#039;t be perfect love story in 3rd ep but that&#039;s awful then &#039;&#039; Kuro &#039;&#039; &#039;who loves mc and confessed him 2 times and get refused refuses him. But it&#039;s okey like I said I&#039; ll be more understanding. Then she trying to get him back. Hmm let&#039;s think about it.<br />
Our Mc love Shiro so he should confess Shiro but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396371">
        he didn&#039;t. Then why Kuro refused him didn&#039;t she loves him it can&#039;t be just a vengeance about relationship He refused me 2 weeks ago so I&#039;ll refuse him now. So absurd.<br />
Story 2/10<br />
Art 8/10<br />
It&#039;s the best thing in this anime. Character design is nice.<br />
Sound 5/10<br />
Character 2/10 bcs of brainless mc and Kuro the vengeance hunter. I would give 1 if it wasn&#039;t shiro<br />
Enjoyment 6/10 It&#039;s ridiculous and bad but funny so I&#039;ll give 6.<br />
Overall 5/10 is fine it could be better.

    Honestly the only thing thats keeping me on watching this series is the VAs.<br />
This is one of my rare watched series thats &quot;Well I&#039;ll just watch it till the end since I started it&quot;. I&#039;m pretty much sure the VAs themselves don&#039;t really like the series that much too, IMO. But hey it pays so why not. <br />
I dont even know whats the inspiration of authors who writes a series like this, where they a shut-in guys back in the day? <br />
Definitely needs a hard drift to make this series good. <br />
One of my worst rated shows in my MAL I guess.

    I will be honest, I think most people only reached the 4th episode and quit, and it makes sense, I think the 4th episode out of the 6 I have watched so far was the worst episode by far. I am not really sure what it was about the episode itself, but it just felt awful to finish it, and I think that is why almost everyone quit there, expecting the absolute failure to continue being awful, but the way the 5th episode started didnt feel to wrong and so I continued, and I found the 5th and 6th episode to be as good as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399139">
        the first 3 episodes which i thoroughly enjoyed. Yes I do genuinely think the last part of the 4th episode was bad, but no I don&#039;t think that is a good enough reason to discredit the show entirely considering what I have watched up until that point and after that point as well. <br />
<br />
Overall the story is somewhat typical, its a somewhat harem type show, but all of the mcs love interests are basically childhood friends in a way. There is also some other plot revolving around show business though i wont go to in depth as I&#039;d rather there not be any real spoilers. <br />
<br />
The art is decent, at some times its ultra high quality, at other times its pretty average but still good enough imo.<br />
<br />
Sound is nice, i really like the OP personally.<br />
<br />
Characters are great imo, i like how conniving the girls are tbh, and how the mc isnt an absolute buffoon, real breath of fresh air.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment has been really high for me, outside of a portion of episode 4 I have enjoyed pretty much everything, and tbh I do not think I am alone on that one, though I think far to many people abandoned the series over what may be considered a couple percent of the entire series watch time.

    In the modern age, we&#039;ve all become accustomed to clickbait, Youtube is saturated with clickbait content as such I&#039;ve grown to be wary whenever I see something too good to be true. As such when I saw the title and synopsis of this show I immediately thought <br />
<br />
&quot;Well this can&#039;t be right, there has to be a catch&quot; <br />
<br />
and sure enough, there is a catch to it, I won&#039;t spoil it or anything but it should be pretty obvious what the catch is. Anyways with that out of the way here&#039;s my take on this show<br />
<br />
This series is like Oresuki so far, it&#039;s satirical, chaotic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396411">
        and it feels like they&#039;re just piling on more and more tropes and cliches just for the hell of it and I love it.  It&#039;s dumb and it starting to become a dumpster fire but I unironically enjoy this series so far.<br />
<br />
Story -7<br />
<br />
The first few episodes just piles up some tropes and mixes them together to create this weird chaotic mess of a plot. This is how I expect this show to flow, basically shoving down tropes and cliches as a satirical take on the romcom harem genre. It&#039;s chaotic but that is what makes it special.<br />
<br />
Art- 7<br />
<br />
Nothing to noteworthy here, It&#039;s good, animation is nice. I like how the mc looks like a budget Futarou but other than that it&#039;s good. I like the color schemes though, it&#039;s very light hearted which is fitting for this series.<br />
<br />
Sound- 9<br />
<br />
The va&#039;s do a great job at their characters.  With the main trio having worked together already in Quintessential quintuplets, the supporting characters have also worked with each other at one point or another as such their chemistry is top notch. With the Mc being voiced by the Harem king himself you know his performance will always be good. The main girls are also great. It&#039;s nice hearing Sakura Ayane in a non genki role where she can flaunt her deeper voice and Inase Minori in an onee-san role rather than her typical Imouto role.  The chemistry between the va&#039;s is good as such they really carry this show.<br />
<br />
Character - 7<br />
<br />
Just like Oresuki, it&#039;s clear that the MC of this show is a bit of a dick but unlike Oresuki the supporting characters are also assholes themselves. It makes for an interesting dynamic but I fear that the writing of these characters might suffer as we go on but for now I like them. I do love Mc&#039;s best friend though as the main catalyst in the ploys of the main trio the best friend does his role well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
<br />
This is one of those series where you have to turn off your brain to enjoy it, this series is best enjoyed after a long tiring day where you can sit back, relax and enjoy the chaos about to unfold. I like it so far, I&#039;m just hoping it doesn&#039;t end like Oresuki but as long as you don&#039;t take the show to seriously you should be able to enjoy this chaos.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7<br />
<br />
The main problem with romcom harem reviews is that people take them too seriously, yes plenty of harem shows are trash and deserve their rating but this series so far isn&#039;t like those. Yes it is chaotic and sure the plot doesn&#039;t flow smoothly but this show isn&#039;t trying to create a meaningful and wholesome story so far rather it&#039;s trying to smash together tropes and cliches then make something out of that mess.<br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t for everyone but this is a good show to watch when you just want to relax and have a good time<br />

    I am not a particularly devoted fan of the love comedy genre. This show was airing so I thought I may as well watch it. And I tried. I really tried to like this show. I tried to be fair to it. I tried to stick it out to the end but I just couldn&#039;t <br />
I saw ep 10 aired and I just couldn&#039;t press the button. I couldn&#039;t put myself through another episode of this shit. And now allow to explain why.<br />
<br />
What is the worst possible crime an anime can make? It&#039;s not having bad characters. It&#039;s not having a bad story. It&#039;s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402711">
        having awful animation. The worst crime an anime can make is to be boring. At least when something is bad you feel emotion. You feel pain. In some sick twisted way you can derive pleasure from that. With this show, I feel nothing. <br />
<br />
The Story <br />
The first arc of this show is a relatively cohesive story about a teenage reject rediscovering his acting talent and overcoming past trauma to impress the girl he likes. The arc is interesting enough to fill an entire season. And it lasts for 3/4 episodes. It was rushed, messy, and ultimately only a series of cheap story beats that didn&#039;t have the minimum level of investment required to feel satisfying. And that is the best thing this show had to offer. Following this is a series of long, drawn out, and completely soulless story arcs about acting and romantic drama. The drama is awful, mainly due to the awful characters (which I&#039;ll get to in a second). It relies on characters making stupid unrealistic decisions to prevent love confessions from resolving the plot too early. The acting side of the story, while sounding like a potentially interesting gimmick ends up being nothing more than that - a gimmick. It&#039;s given no real development and is more of a background than an aspect of the story. <br />
<br />
The Characters<br />
We are introduced to the cliche romantic comedy cast - loner MC that&#039;s mildly perverted, but is offset by his friend- who is a loud and proud pervert with a mysterious personality. Then there&#039;s the women. A smart, sophisticated, teenage actor who acts aloof but secretly has feelings for the MC. That is until the end of the first arc where she devolves into a brainless love zombie who is obsessed with the MC in every way possible. Then you&#039;ve got his childhood friend, who starts off as a smart, intelligent, independent, mature, true-to-herself girl who openly admits her love for the MC at the very start. And then becomes a dumb, emotional, immature, irrational, idiotic girl who turns into a brainless love zombie obsessed with the MC. The MC even openly confesses his love for her but because plot she rejects him and even pretends to have amnesia (spoiler if you really cared about this awful anime) just so that the story can continue. There&#039;s a third loli love interest that&#039;s just kind of there and I&#039;m going to pretend she doesn&#039;t exist because she may as well not. And random female cast members just randomly fall in love with the MC for no apparent reason. Motivations are a mess and none of the characters have any depth. All attempts to give characters depth fall flat on their face and feel wooden and hollow. But despite their failures, they just keep trying to give characters more and more backstory, more and more different, secret motivations. But because of the awful, soulless execution, the show just falls flat on its face into a bed of needles tipped with the most deadly poison imaginable, that are then coated in gasoline and lit on fire, before the entire bed of flaming, poison tipped needles is dumped into an ocean full of bloodthirsty sharks. These characters are a travesty<br />
<br />
The Animation<br />
the characters themselves look good. Most of the budget went into their eyes and face. However the issue is then with the animation. It feels so wooden and unrealistic because the animators don&#039;t want to change the angle of the faces and have to redraw it. So despite the surface level high quality the show feels cheap and stilted. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
this is kind of important because there are a few dance routines and recitals. The music was...meh. I personally hate pop in general so I can&#039;t even tell what sounds good or bad below a certain level of quality. The music used in the rest of the show is stock music at best, and the OP is meh and forgettable. Overall just average for a love comedy.<br />
<br />
My Enjoyment<br />
Well I think you can tell from the character section that I just really don&#039;t like this show. It&#039;s boring, it&#039;s bland, it&#039;s slow paced, it&#039;s poorly directed, the characters are dead, the story is basically nonexistant after episode 4, and after all this the show has the gall to pretend that it&#039;s smart and funny. <br />
I almost feel like a 3 is too good for it, but I have to be fair in some way. Don&#039;t watch this. Don&#039;t think about watching this. It&#039;s basically just another identical copy + paste love comedy with a twist that is never fully explored. Just go watch any number of better ones that have come out these past few years
