    When I first saw the announcement of this title I was pretty disgusted.  Another incest title?  Really?  Doesn&#039;t Japan ever get sick of this crap?  It makes me fear for the well being of all of Japan&#039;s imouto&#039;s if this disgusting sentiment is so widespread that it can sustain a substantial subset of the anime programming lineup.  However despite my reservations and do to my own morbid curiosity with anime train wrecks, I decided to give Onii-chan no Koto nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!! a try.<br />
<br />
The first thing that one is going to notice is just how completely ugly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35626">
        and unappealing the character designs are.   Everyone looks deformed, with malformed bodies, monkey ears, and gigantic hands and feet.  This decision seems strange considering this is an ecchi title, in which a lot of the humor revolves around sexual content and, apparently, is supposed to titillate the viewer.  However it utterly fails at this because I found the artistic choices made to be so god awful to look at that I found it to be wholly inappropriate.  Besides the deformed characters the backgrounds are mostly plain and uninteresting and color palette appears drab and washed out.  It’s probably the most repulsive looking anime I think I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
The overall plot for Onii-chan lacks any real depth or direction.  For starters, if you were expecting an incest romance comedy along the lines of something like Kiss x Sis, then you’re likely to be disappointed.  What we are presented with is a boy, Shuusuke, who has a little sister complex with Nao, who conveniently has a older brother complex.  Like many shows that deal with incestuous content, they seem to give themselves some moral cover by making the pair not blood related.  This isn’t much of a spoiler, since it’s revealed about ten minutes into the first episode.  The story proceeds along as a slice of life and slapstick comedy.<br />
<br />
I found pretty much all of Onii-chan to be disgusting and morally corrupt.  The majority of my experience with this show could best be divided between the desire for nauseous vomiting and bursting into flames of rage.  The characters themselves are as distasteful and repugnant on the inside as they are visually unappealing.  All of the characters are abnormal deviants that run the gambit between being sexual predators, sadists, stalkers, pedophiles, and perverts.  It’s not that these things are new or unusual to anime, because they are frankly featured in practically everything these days.  However there is really not one &quot;decent&quot; person in the entire cast and the way that most of their activities are portrayed as the norm for people of this age made me want to throw up.<br />
<br />
Now that I have gotten off my soapbox about the decline of decent society, the key reason why this show fails so miserably is the cast.  Like so many other harem type shows, it’s soon weighted down with way to many girls.  We get introduced to their various personalities/perversions and then watch them throw themselves at the lead, much to the series other hussy&#039;s chagrin.  Rinse and repeat with a new girl after a couple of episodes.<br />
<br />
Shuusuke himself isn’t much to speak of.  He is typical of harem boys and even more of those from this kind of series.  Perhaps the only thing that makes him atypical from his peers is just how much of a sick disgusting pervert he is.  I suppose it is not that abnormal for boys his age to be interested in dirty magazines and comics, but they take it to extremes that ended up just making my skin crawl.  Such as some of his various fetishes and the demeaning fashion that he ogles the girls panties, breasts, and anything else that seems to sexually excite him.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Shuusuke&#039;s harem of girls is not any more pure.  Nao is quite possibly the worst of the entire bunch.  She spends her time spying on and finding ways to torment her older brother.  At first these seem to be spawned simply just out of jealousy, but soon they take a darker and more sinister meaning.  Nao seems to take an euphoric, almost sexual satisfaction in seeing her brother in pain or descending deeper into his perversity.  To varying degrees this is repeated amongst the other girls.  While they all have deep seeded psychological issues none of them ever seems to be as messed up as Nao.  Whether it&#039;s Iroha&#039;s telescopic observations and sexual advances or Kondou&#039;s fascination with BL manga and male nipples.<br />
<br />
Despite my overall contempt for Onii-chan, I won’t lie and say that some of it was not pretty funny.  Even though finding the humor is akin to picking out the undigested kernels of corn from a piece of shit.  I also felt ashamed of myself for laughing at any of it too.  Clearly this show was not for me and I would advise anyone to avoid it at all costs.  For those of you who really liked this show and thought it was hilarious, I don&#039;t think we can be friends.<br />

    Version 2<br />

   What&#039;s with japanese people and incest with really long anime titles???<br />
Its very hard to recommend people this anime when you don&#039;t speak a freakin japanese word! But luckily I wouldn&#039;t need to recommend this one to any of my friends (Except to one or two of those incest freaks)<br />
<br />
As the title suggests, this is indeed another incest anime. However unlike Oreimo, the sister INDEED is trying to get laid with her bro. And the best part is we can hear her thoughts as well. The entire series revolves around both her and big brother in their never ending quest to satisfy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33617">
        their sexual fetishes.<br />
<br />
I didnt really enjoy the art. Big ear, skinny body, and large hands? Well ok.. Im not really complaining because everyone have their different preference in art. <br />
<br />
Introducing your typical characters, a perverted brother trying to resist his sexual urges and tsundere pretending type sister who has a bro-con. I wouldn&#039;t expect much of a development there.<br />
And by the way, similar to Haru from Yosuga no Sora, HE DOESN&#039;T KNOW HOW TO LOCK DOORS!!<br />
<br />
This anime is specificly for the enjoyment of perverts out there who loves panty shots and fanservice. Thats why I gave it an above average rating because it served its purpose.<br />
<br />
And to people who think that watching this sort of anime encourages incest? No it doesn&#039;t. However if you have a sister you might start noticing some event with your sister which might be considered incest innuendos that you might never realized it before. (Cool eh? The power of incest animes!)<br />
<br />
EDITED:<br />
Since all the characters are out, I shall finally review them.<br />
<br />
Specimen #1: Shuu (Big brother, pervert, slight masochist)<br />
Introducing the main harem lead for this series. A loyal follower of the eroligion (Yes, I invented that word) since he was a kid, and also member of his porn sharing club. He is indecisive but takes serious action when needed. And when I say &quot;needed&quot; this usually involves porn mags. He is a hero to all those who follow the ero-mags as thier bibles. He loves his sister very much but not to the point of incest (Damnit!) and tries his best to be on good terms with her while being a closet pervert.<br />
<br />
Specimen #2: Nao (sister, tsundere-ish, pervert as well, slight sadist with abnormal fetish)<br />
Ok, so this girl is the main heroine of the series. Now the one interesting fetish she has is she actually gets horny she discovers her brothers fetishes. This is one weird girl! She actually enjoys seeing her bro getting horny?! WOW! Where can I get a sister like that?? Later on in the episodes, it was revealed that she actually gets horny when her brother gets sexually excited as well. What deep brother-sister bond had these two developed?! She doesn&#039;t necessarily gets jealous when her brother is with another girl. Now this is the sort of girl who is harem potential!<br />
<br />
Specimen #3, Iroha (childhood friend, another pervert, obsessive, stalker)<br />
Would you want a girl who would do anything for you?? Of course you would! If I ever get a girl like Iroha... Im.... going... to..... ask her to make me some sammiches! Anyways, sandwich jokes aside, this girl is the main source of all the pantyshots and fanservive (no matter how irrelevant the scenario is for a panty shot) A childhood friend who loves Shuu till the point of obsession...<br />
<br />
Specimen #4, Mayuka (Class rep, BL pervert, quiet and shy)<br />
Those who have those black stockings fetish would definitely love her. She a big fan of BL, however Im not suprised after receiving a BL fanservice in one of the episode, I was expecting for a girl like that to show up.<br />
<br />
After watching several episodes, it is humorous in its own way so I can&#039;t complain. Reminds me a lot like B Gata H Kei, so those who liked that series may enjoy this one as well. <br />
Anyways, if you have thing for sis-con or bro-con like KissXSis or Yosuga no Sora then by all means watch this anime. It&#039;s a comedic and parody the typical anime culture makes it worth while to kill some time while waiting for your sister to come back from school. Those who follows the sacrilegious path of ero-ness would also be touched by the sheer will of Shuu who represents the combined spirit of all the perverts in the world! <br />
<br />
As the great Sigmund Freud once said &quot;Incest can always be rearranged to be spelled as Nicest&quot;<br />
<br />
I seriously enjoyed this show, even though it is a bit cliche, but its full of gags and should not be taken serious, just relax and follow the flow and you too may very well have you very own harem ending one day.<br />
<br />
Haremu Kingu,<br />

I honestly don&#039;t think this anime was too bad. I mean, why would you watch this show if you had something against incest? I don&#039;t like it in real life, but in anime it&#039;s okay, imo. But it states in the first episode that they aren&#039;t blood-related, and that the sister was adopted. <br />
<br />
The story wasn&#039;t anything new. A girl&#039;s crushing on her step-brother, he has a childhood lover who wants him, and some cute girl also likes him (and at the end a cosplay-obsessed girl tries to steal his heart). I find this on the unrealistic side of things because he&#039;s commonly referred

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41783">
        to as scum, and he&#039;s also part of a perverted group called AGE (All Genre Ero). I don&#039;t see why so many girls would like him if they all knew about this hobby of his. Well, the girls commonly fight over him, yada yada. The story was really light-hearted. It was nothing to make you really feel.<br />
<br />
THE ART. Don&#039;t get me started. The first thing I noticed was how skinny the characters were. It was really a turn-off for me. I almost stopped watching the anime right then, since I&#039;m really picky about the art of animes I watched. But the show made me giggle a few times, so I decided to continue.<br />
<br />
The characters were nothing new. There was the perverted older brother, the sometimes bratty little sister, the hot stalker girl, the shy yaoi lover, and the lesbian with the fanbase. None of the characters had real depth, and they were nothing I&#039;d ever seen before. I&#039;d have to say the sister was the best though, I thought it was nice how she didn&#039;t mind her brother&#039;s perverted-ness.<br />
<br />
I thought this anime was pretty funny, though. Instead of censors, they used penguins or cats. The boys would openly talk about the fetishes, and why they liked such things. The sister would go out of her way to let the brother get a peek of her underwear, then punish him afterwards. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed it. It wasn&#039;t a masterpiece, or anything award-worthy, but I had fun watching it.

    Okay, it&#039;s not the most beautiful show with the smartest and most epic plot ever. In fact, it&#039;s just an average gag comedy with strange art, some retarded characters and incest love. So is it boring and generic? Not at all. The art is really strange and characters really look a bit like aliens. But damn it, it&#039;s gag comedy after all, and this unusual look is just making it less serious. And that&#039;s very good this doesn&#039;t look serious because it allows to enjoy the strongest comedy side of the anime, which bases on apparently retarded gags. Well, they look stupid, indeed, but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33622">
        fact this stupidity is intended actually makes the show funny. These jokes are not, however,  like &quot;this is stupid, therefore it&#039;s funny&quot; - this show&#039;s casual character really allows to enjoy it. This show is not a slapstic, it is not an inteligen comedy as well, this is just light, enjoyable incest story with tons of gag for people who like average, but simultaneously well made and really funny comedies.<br />
<br />
...so far, of course, but episode 1 is very promising.

    &quot;For what shall it profit an Otaku if he should find the worst anime in the whole world, and lose his own sanity?&quot;   - Book of Weaboo 8:36<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, I asked my friend what the worst manga he had ever read was. He answered without hesitation that it was a manga called &quot;I don&#039;t like you at all big brother!&quot;. I decided to research this title and discovered to my utter terror that this manga actually was popular enough to receive a 13 episode anime adaptation. I watched this anime on my laptop during a 5 hour car trip. I weep

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193840">
        that the horrors I beheld can never be unseen. <br />
<br />
Plot and characters:<br />
<br />
This is yet another brother/sister incest anime, but what separates Onii-Chan no Koto apart from the others is how UNBELIEVABLY annoying it is and how profoundly unfunny the jokes are. The main character is an incredibly obnoxious little brat named Nao, whose life&#039;s goal is to get her perverted elder brother Shusuke to have sex with her. Shusuke may be a lecherous cretin and has a large collection of incest porn, but at first he resists the temptations of his younger sister and shows SOME moral scruples. I must say I am thankful that the anime never gets nearly as... &quot;explicit&quot;  as the original manga apparently does. More women are introduced each episode as Shusuke builds perhaps the most questionable harem in anime history. WHY are the women attracted to this guy?! It never even attempts to explain what qualities Shusuke has (besides being an unfunny pervert) that all women in this series love! Onii-chan no Koto also manages to take a very old anime cliche&#039; and use it worse than I have ever seen before! If you have ever seen an anime, you know that at least 1 character is likely going to get amnesia. This is even true of anime I personally love like Monster, Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, Ergo Proxy, and Penguindrum. Onii-chan no Koto uses amnesia so frequently, so pointlessly, and with such terrible explanations that I was actually shocked. I wish I could randomly get amnesia and forget that I ever saw this fucking anime!<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s art style follows the manga&#039;s, which is bad. REALLY bad! The manga artist for Onii-Chan no Koto clearly stole the style of several famous mangaka and fused together styles that were NEVER intended to mix! For example, he stole his face drawing technique from Ken Akamatsu of Love Hina and the way he draws limbs from Eiichiro Oda of One Piece. Basically just put Naru Narusegawa&#039;s face on Luffy&#039;s body and that is what the character design looks like!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
 What baffles me about Onii-Chan no Koto is how it can so clearly reign supreme in a sub-genre of anime that is so terrible in the first place! At least Oreimo tried to tackle social stigma against Otaku and Aki-Sora actually had the total amorality to show explicit sex between blood siblings and give perverts exactly what they wanted without wasting more than 20 minutes. This fucking series has ZERO redeeming qualities, wastes the viewer&#039;s time with 12 episodes + 1 OVA, and is as entertaining as having the German National Football Team take turns kicking you in the nuts! I&#039;ve seen a LOT of bad anime and this is easily one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life!

    Yes, I realise that one episode reviews aren&#039;t the best. But whatever. <br />
<br />
So, should you watch this? No. No you shouldn&#039;t. Don&#039;t waste your time with this... psuedo-incest piece of shit. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m sick of this whole &quot;they&#039;re not blood related SO IT&#039;S OKAY!&quot; incest. No, Japan. Stop. If you&#039;re going to make a series about incest, there is no point unless they&#039;re blood related. Non-blood related sibling incest is so overdone at this point that it drives me mad. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the art. Whoever animated this obviously never took Anatomy 101. Yes, it&#039;s anime and it doesn&#039;t have to be realistic. But DAMN. Everything is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33905">
        off. The characters are far too skinny, have ears the size of the eyes of a 90s shoujo anime character and so on. Ugh. They put CLAMP&#039;s spagghetti people to shame. <br />
<br />
It also doesn&#039;t help that the characters are all annoying and stupid. Nao is a slut, and her brother&#039;s just pathetic. He does have an awesome porn collection, though. I&#039;ll give him that.<br />
<br />
Because I was so bored while watching, I decided to count the number of panty shots. There were about 14 or so. Panty shots add NOTHING AT ALL to the story and they are annoying as Hell. Stop it, Japan.<br />
<br />
Please, don&#039;t waste your time on this. Watch one of the better series this season. I&#039;m giving this one more episode, but I&#039;m expecting to drop it.

    5 Episodes in is ample time to review an anime like this.<br />
<br />
Anyways, lets review Onii-chan no Koto.... you know the rest. In an old baka to review of mine I stated that having a name like... Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, was just terribly long, awkward, and un-original. Well Onii-chan here decided to up the anti and create an anime with one of the longest titles of all time. I know pretty much everybody has and will harp on this, but seriously, its hard to recommend / dismiss this anime when you can&#039;t remember the bloody name of it. <br />
<br />
Sigh... So where do I begin

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34435">
        with Onii-chan ****. For once I believe I&#039;ll start with the art. Onii-chan etc etc, has one of the weirdest art styles I&#039;ve seen in quite a while. The people look alien in it... like weird hideously deformed mannequins marching across the screen. They&#039;re EXTREMELY thin, they&#039;re arms and legs seem slightly bent in an odd way, it all feels off. It doesn&#039;t really detract from the show too much (for me at least), but its not really giving it any gold stars.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve always said for this kind of show that 2 things are necessary, and the rest is just added on. 1). The characters must be likable / relatable / enjoyable to watch, and 2). It must be funny. Plot is a nice touch, but not necessary as the only purpose of this show is to provide idiotic humor to help us escape from the pains of reality. And does Onii-chan no Koto nanka *omgitdoesn&#039;tend* Zenzen Suki Janain *makeitstop* Dakara ne!!deliever in these 2 categories? Well... kinda. <br />
<br />
The characters are actually fairly original for this kind of genre. The main lead is your basic token pervert, but what do you expect, your here for the GIRLS. The main attraction? of this show is that the main girl is in fact his ADOPTED sister (because we want a nice legal show that still borders on the extreme creepiness of incest). The girl in question, Nao, is a fairly interesting character. She is downright determined to give herself, body and soul to her NOT BLOOD RELATED brother (remember no blood relation means its not creepy). But first she seems to love toying with him. The funniest part about her, and most probably of the entire show, is how she forces her brother into awkward situations, and then basically orgasms over her brothers reaction. Its funny to see what she&#039;s actually planning and then how it all turns out. <br />
<br />
The next femlae lead is Iroha whom, after one glance, I was like damn... theres gonna be a tusndere... But onii-chan so on and so forth, decided to reject that Idea and instead turn her into a stalker, which makes her a much much MUCH more likable character. So if you weren&#039;t already reeling at the originality of a &quot;Adopted Sister&quot; romance, then get prepared for this shocker. Shes a childhood friend, a character trait that has only been used in about 342352345 anime before this one. And of course, the final love interest is the class president, who looks like a shy girl, and turns out to be a shy girl who likes Yaoi, and keeps ALMOST doing perverted things. Both are relatively funny characters, but get predictable after a while. <br />
<br />
All in all, the characters are fairly likable, with a good amount of originality to forgo they&#039;re extremely cliche back stories, but is it funny? Weeelllllllll.... yes its funny enough. Its not rolling on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter, and usually its pretty predictable. But its still gonna get a few chuckles out&#039;ve you. The perversity of it all might be a bit much for some people, but hey for a show about incest... Its a lot cleaner than most anime I&#039;ve seen. It even has a random penguin / cat covering up all the panty shots. All in all its not bad, but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
So in the end.. sigh... I begrudgingly say that I do enjoy this show. Its nothing spectacular, and I will probably forget it fairly quickly once its over, but its still a good show to end the day with. Grab a coke, maybe some popcorn, relax in a comfortable chair, and have yourself a couple chuckles at the perversity of it all. Onii-chan *insertfootballstadiumhere* Dakara ne!! is something harem fans will probably enjoy, and a great way to creep out your family by saying proudly &quot;Today I watched a show about (technically not quite) Incest.&quot;<br />

    Incest is a touchy subject, deemed morally wrong by the general populace. Luckily, this anime throws that concept out the window, so it&#039;s a lot less awkward for the viewer. (Though still quite awkward. :x)<br />
<br />
Onii-chan no koto more or less, deals with three girls who like the same guy for the wrong reasons. The plot in itself, isn&#039;t anything special, being more or less, your standard ecchi comedy. The humor usually didn&#039;t cut it for me, though it had a few chuckle moments. The one thing that separates Onii-chan no koto from other ecchi comedies would have to be the main girls themselves.<br />
<br />
Nao, the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35436">
        character, is a step sister who has though she was a sister for the length of her life. A car crash left her orphaned (and conveniently, gave her amnesia so she forgot everything that happened before) and she becomes adopted her dead father&#039;s friend, who has a son who&#039;s about a year older than Nao. For whatever reason, Nao decided to become a closet pervert (though not exactly, since her secret is well known by her close friends), who “wants to be in a forbidden relationship with Onii-chan for the thrill of being in a forbidden relationship.” Once she discovers she&#039;s not a biological sister (which manages to happen in the first episode), the back story is never mentioned again, except by many girls who quickly reference that she cannot be that close with her brother. As much of a spoiler as this sounds, I more or less, just described the first episode, so if you&#039;re reading this review before watching the show, you&#039;re going to see it immediately anyways. Basically, the story line won&#039;t be dealing with incest. It&#039;s just another pervert girl with aho-ge. Admittedly, I find it cute when she pretends to be innocent to entice her brother, then does her “3...2....1....fan service time over. =S HENTAI!!!!” bit.<br />
<br />
The Onii-chan in question is Shuusuke. Hiding porn in quite literally every inconspicuous  centimeter of his room, he&#039;s probably the most blatant pervert ever to exist in animation/manga. He&#039;s rather dense about the fact that three girls are out to get his lips/in his pants/his nipples, he&#039;s a weakling who is easily pressured into doing something, and he&#039;s somewhat respectful on top of that too, so he&#039;s a male stereotype. For the most part, I found his performance throughout the series rather bland, and could only pick out about 3 scenes across the 12 episodes which I found “not boring” to watch him in. To sum him up, he&#039;s the plot device that every girl (who part of the main cast) wants, and every guy (aka fellow pervert) wants to hang with.<br />
<br />
Rivaling Nao for the race to Shuusuke&#039;s heart is Iroha, a childhood friend overloaded with stalker technology who took a promise way too far, and Mayuka, a model student/class representative who secretly goes out at night to buy and read Yaoi books, and has a strong nipple fetish.<br />
<br />
The rest of the supporting class feature Shuusuke&#039;s group of friends who enjoy porn as much as he does, and Shuusuke/Nao&#039;s parents. The parents don&#039;t play much of a role, merely existing to explain Nao&#039;s origins, while Shuusuke&#039;s group of friends effectively try to get him to actively share and discuss porn, which he, being the biggest pervert he is, agrees to. I personally didn&#039;t care for their antics, but they get into odd situations involving their hobby, which made for some okay drama and development.<br />
<br />
Each of the three girls get their moments to star but for the majority of the series, it&#039;s really just Nao and Iroha fighting with each other, while Mayuka makes a(n) (innocent) move. It was sorta funny the first time, but even after doing it in about four different situations, it gets pretty repetitive. The saving grace of whatever is left in the plot is the relationship between Iroha and Nao, which I find rather intriguing. Rather than just duke it out when along with Shuusuke every time they appear on screen, their rivalry goes as far to try and prevent any other girl from making a move on their Onii-chan/Shuu-chan. It&#039;s pretty fun to watch their inner thoughts seem to have a conversation with each other, as they allow their actions to convey their words. The understanding between them, to the point of considering each other friends, is pretty cute, and has been the main reason I watched the series through to the end. Mayuka&#039;s solo time was also quite cute, though I wish all of the Yaoi-esque moments could&#039;ve been toned down a bit. There&#039;s also an additional anime-exclusive, though its only purpose seems to be to create a few yuri moments (probably to subvert all of the yaoi I had to endure, blech).<br />
<br />
the character models, though unique, and pretty weird to look at. Bony body structures, baggy eyes, and an overall beat up look. At times, it makes me feel like I watching rape victims assimilating to a new lifestyle. The characters are so malnourished that several potential fan service shots are blocked out by fuzzy penguins and cats, just so people don&#039;t have to stare at their horror. Okay, that&#039;s not the real reason for the cutesy censors, but it&#039;s not hard to tell that they were likely unappealing. Even the opening had a full-on frontal panty shot, so the censors just felt unnecessary. In effect, the two aspects that make an ecchi series (fan service and hot/cute characters) are never completely there. Animation is sub standard, which wasn&#039;t too surprising. Character designs are generic, though they do their job.<br />
<br />
The sound is fairly standard. Background music consists of a soundtrack which almost feels like a parody on romance dramas. Anything else easily fades into the background. Sound effects are quirky (I swear I heard the scooby doo running one once) though they get the job done. The voices for the cast were overall good. Eri Kitamura does a great job voicing the adorable Nao, Marina Inoue makes Iroha sound more mature than she appears, and Kazusa Aranami (a lesser known seiyuu) does a pretty nice job as Mayuka. The opening and ending songs are standard J-Pop, though the ending song is pretty damn catchy.<br />
<br />
Overall, “Onii-chan no koto nanka zenzen suki janaiin dakara ne!” (try saying that 10 times fast =_=)  is your typical ecchi comedy. The main girls are the show case, and despite their rare perks, they will act cliched at times and repeat similar situations just on a different background. If you don&#039;t mind the character designs (and the yaoi about mid way in), this anime can provide a few chuckles, but there are better ecchi comedies out there. If you came in expecting some actual incest, then you&#039;re kinda sick/you&#039;ll be disappointed.<br />

    As soon as you read the title for this series, you know it is about incest. I must say that I regret taking the time out of my day to watch this. First of all, the story is about a young adoptive sister pointlessly trying to win the affection of her brother and have the fantasy of actually committing incest. This story has no direction and every episode is the same as the last.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the art is terrible. The characters are disproportional and look like damn tellitubbies. It is obvious that the writer and illustrator hardly put any work into this series and it was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39142">
        a huge disappointment. This series is utter crap, and disgusting. If the writer was looking to give the viewer a laugh with the childish and sexual jokes, he/she completely failed. I did not laugh once during this series, and found it painful to watch. I have no idea why i kept watching this anime till the very end, perhaps i wanted to see if it got any better?<br />
<br />
Only funny thing about this anime is that it was actually given the time to be aired. I would recommend that you DO NOT WATCH this series, it is just a waste of your time.<br />

    Wow at all these people giving this low score ONLY because it&#039;s not their &#039;preferred&#039; genre. Don&#039;t diss just because you&#039;re not the targeted audience. <br />
<br />
OMG ANOTHER INCEST ANIME? I AM DISGUSTED. 1/10 + rant about crap no one cares about.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you have enough time to rant about how much you hate &#039;x&#039; kind of anime, why don&#039;t you go rant/review all hentai anime and rate them 1/10 as well? or you can reassess your mental well-being and go watch and review something you actually like.<br />
<br />
/rant<br />
<br />
My review: I&#039;ll keep it concise.<br />
<br />
This anime is meant for males and some females with normal libido level. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55919">
        100% comedy to blow away all your stress and boredom. <br />
<br />
Story - Typical harem anime (various girls trying to win over a guy.. etc.)<br />
<br />
Characters - Lots of types that we&#039;ve all seen before<br />
<br />
Art/Animation - Characters look disproportion only in first episode. Otherwise, it&#039;s a colorful anime but doesn&#039;t burn your eyes. Animation is well-done as well.<br />
<br />
Sound - Not repetitive and gets the job done<br />
<br />
Overall - This is your typical ecchi harem anime that emphasizes on ecchi/fanservice jokes. If you&#039;re a straight male with normal libido, you&#039;ll have a good time. For everyone else, please stay safe.

OK, so the anime has ended and we await the OVA, so, how do I find this anime? Well, first of all, I have not gone through the manga yet, so, any comment I make is simply based on this anime only, so let’s get down to business, shall we?<br />
<br />
Story – dreadful number 2.<br />
<br />
This anime follows your usual harem/ecchi/ comedy/ incest (I think) kinda thing, but what makes it dreadful is that the story goes back and forth from being a fanservice to implementing censoring duties, the way it goes is that it’s something that will lure you in and as soon as you get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35621">
        closer, the door it suddenly slams and shuts you out. This is evident of the censoring panty shots of the female cast, which by the way, it is done as if the author of this anime intentionally deems it. Therefore it isn’t very random, in fact I’m thinking that the author of this anime did not  created this anime for entertainment purposes , but is somehow to leave us audiences hanged , so why shouldn’t I give this anime a dreadful number 2?<br />
<br />
Art- dreadful number 2.<br />
<br />
Whoever is the illustrator of this anime, is either a lousy artist or a lazy one. If one is to look as to how the characters were drawn it looks like  that it is drawn by a 10 year old kid who’s somewhat a mangaka wannabe. I guess  the illustrator is banking on the ecchi part so that us audience would see past his/her drawings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound- decent number 4.<br />
<br />
Well, I  like the opening theme.<br />
<br />
Characters – dreadful number 2.<br />
<br />
Let’s go over each main character:<br />
<br />
Nao Takanashi- Ok, so she’s not really the muchacho’s (Shuusuke) hermana, she has hot’s for his step brother, actually she’s a tease, she goes back and forth from being sweet angel to being a she devil when it come to odd situations involving her step brother. Which I kinda dislike, co’z she doesn’t do much in helping his step brother from getting out those so-called odd situations and at times she’s part of it. By the way, among the female cast, she’s the only one who has the most uncensored panty shots.<br />
<br />
Shuusuke Takanashi- He’s Nao’s step brother (we all know that), he’s part of a quartet of prevs call “All Eroge Genre” or AEG. He’s an avid porn collector and plays computer eroge games, however he’s too stupid let go of his virginity with Iroha and instead contents himself looking and collecting porn magazines and yanking his joystick. Never the less, he still for maintains a level of respect for Nao and for the rest of the female cast. But he’s still stupid for refusing Iroha’s offer (to be banged) and making a big deal about his porn collection.<br />
<br />
Kondou Mayuka – So, she’s muchacho’s’s class rep, big deal, at first I thought that the master and pet thing that she has with the muchacho will continue until the end of the anime. But as it turns out, the relationship lasted only a couple of episode in which she’s back to covertly buying her fave boy’s love eroge magazine and seems to have let go of her pet, the muchacho (Shuusuke). I also thought that she’ll have longer roles in the anime, but in the last 3 episode she’s demoted to a support role, oh yeah, I hate her panty hose.<br />
<br />
Iroha Tsuchiura – she’s the muchacho’s childhood friend and she’s the first girl whom the muchacho saw naked when they were kids, the muchacho is playing doctor and she’s the patient, what I like about her, is being direct with the muchacho and her kissing scene with him, among the chicas of this anime, she’s probably the most prettiest faces, but her body looks like faggot. I can never understand her stalking the muchacho when she can aggressively assert her right to be with the latter.<br />
<br />
And the rest of the cast are trivial,  frankly, what makes me rate this part as dreadful, are their roles which it goes to all kinds of wishy washy situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- a good number 7.<br />
<br />
Despite of all that the comedy part seems to be ok, or a lease for that part alone I can look past the hanging fanservice and the way the characters were drawn .<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall – a good number 7<br />
<br />
Overall the comedy part was able to make up for this anime’s poorly drawn characters and the author’s way of hanging us audiences about the fanservice, definitely, not for kid 11 and below, but perfect for teens entering puberty.      <br />
<br />

    Okay, it&#039;s your pretty standard bro-con, little sis likes big brother, incest, comedy anime but what it does different is... well... the animation for one. When you&#039;re going to watch this anime you definitely have to open your mind and not take this anime seriously. This anime has a &quot;different&quot; art style (thin bodies with big hands) which may turn off some but, it&#039;s actually effective.<br />
<br />
I found the anime pretty fun and entertaining,i and is pretty self-aware.<br />
If you like some off the wall comedy, ecchi, and an incest flavor to your anime (and willing to give the art syle a chance), you should definitely check

    If you like the first episode, go read the manga.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
This is an incest comedy wherein common depoctions of little sister characters (and harem characters in general) are satirzed. The story is sympathetic towards the little sister character Nao, and the other harem stereotypes who all turn out to be pretty messed up while admitting that Shuuske, the dude, really doesn&#039;t deserve all the attention he gets, and if he is popular with girls it&#039;s probably because these girls are certifiably insane often bordering on yandere.<br />
<br />
Premise:<br />
Girl, Nao, is obsessed with her perverted older brother Shuuske. She dreams of getting thrown out of the house and running

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180788">
        off alone together with him rejected by society for their forbidden love. Needless to say she&#039;s a bit of an ecentric. <br />
<br />
Other girls on and off express an interest in Shuuske. Hijinks ensue.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I love Nao. A lot of people say she&#039;s too manipulative and creepy and I&#039;ve even heard some people say she doesn&#039;t deserve Shuuske (as if that were an issue), but me I say she doesn&#039;t let silly things like common decency or sense get in the way of her ideals. She&#039;s a go-getter. I&#039;ve seen more cutthroat obsessive girls, but none with more Batman-like preparedness or control. Every scene she&#039;s in is golden, and as the main point of view character she&#039;s in a lot.<br />
<br />
Other girls include a staler childhood friend of Shuuske&#039;s and a shy quite bookish girl who as it turns out all those books she reads are hardcore yaoi.<br />
<br />
Shuuske is perverted but nice. Not all that different from most harem heroes. There&#039;s a lot of focus on the suffering his perversity brings him. Nao&#039;s interest in him is rather idiosyncratic in nature, but he can also be very sweet. I can see why certain desperate girls might like him. I think Nao sums him up in the first lines of the series.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I hold this up as an example of an anime I was sure would never be made. And in all honesty I still think it was objectively a mistake to make this at the time it was made. Ever since, I have no idea what will be made an anime. I don&#039;t know what goes through producers&#039; minds. Maybe they saw how well Oreimo did and thought the public was screaming for incest comedy. Unlikely considering the release date, but who knows?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I like the manga, it funny, and this series follows it fairly closely. On the other hand, the art style of the manga does not hold up in animation (it was a web comic for god&#039;s sake). Also, the manga had like twenty chapters out when this aired. That covered about two and a half plot arcs. At about episode 9 or ten, the series just starts making shit up, which I guess would be fine if they had any talent for it. The manga&#039;s English translator was really worried that the manga would follow the developments of the anime for a while. We all breathed a sigh of relief when it turned out the animation studio didn&#039;t have clue and had diverged wildly from where the story was going.  <br />
<br />
In this way, its a lot like Fruits Basket in that they started making the anime before the manga was finished and they stuck really close to the manga but had to make up the ending. Unfortunately, whereas the Fruits Basket anime showed off the best of the Manga while coincidentally hiding some of the weaker point of the story, and came up with an acceptable ending, Oniichan no Koto cuts out some good parts from a manga which didn&#039;t have that much going for it to begin with and botches the ending. It still manages to maintain a lot of the humor, but it needs the manga as a crutch.<br />
<br />
Also, I don&#039;t care what the author says, Nao&#039;s hair is red. At least the manga lets me dream.

    Welcome to Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews! This series is one of those that I really wonder why I subjected myself to the entire thing. It is a rather banal series, failing on pretty much all fronts it attempts to tackle. While it can be mildly amusing at moments, the experience overall falls quite flat. If you need ecchi, there are far better choices out there. If you are looking for comedy, be aware this show never really rises above the tired sex tropes we&#039;ve all likely heard a million times by now. While not as dreadful as some titles I&#039;ve seen, it&#039;s still probably not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326145">
        worth the time it takes to watch. Let&#039;s break down what we&#039;ve got here. <br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
We&#039;re treading very well worn ground in this one, as we have a little sister who is obsessively attracted to her older brother. Her obsession runs so deep she keeps him on a level of surveillance that would make the CIA balk. In the very beginning this is pretty disturbing, but she soon learns that she is indeed adopted and that her and her brother are step siblings. This isn&#039;t really a spoiler, as it&#039;s trotted out as part of the basic premise. The obvious question is how in the world would she not remember or know that she was adopted, well, the show handles this by hand-waving it away by her adopted parents telling her that she had suffered an injury or whatever that caused her amnesia in regards to her childhood memories. This condition has no further effect on her, and is never mentioned again. <br />
<br />
The parents tell her that her brother does remember, but asked the family to keep everything a secret from her. This revelation does nothing but further fuel her sexual desires for her brother. She continuously sets up situations where the brother is treated to a nice view of her panties, and tries to catch him in situations where he can see her naked body. She does the same old tricks of slipping into bed with him and the like. Predictably none of her actions leads to any real progress towards her brocon goals. <br />
<br />
Soon enough the regular harem type stereotypes appear, such as the childhood friend that is pretty much as insanely in lust with the brother as the little sister, and so forth. Very standard fare for the most part, only taken to an over-the-top level. The brother also fits the pattern found in most of these type shows of being rather oblivious to the whole situation around him and is obsessed with porn himself. He never realizes he has these girls competing to be the first one to bang him, so he becomes easily blackmail-able by the threat of the rest of the girls threatening to reveal his habits to his sister. This does little, however, in getting the other girls to make any real progress towards their naughty goals either. <br />
<br />
What is the deal with step sibling ecchi-ness? We have things like this popping up all over, from the near hentai-fest of KissxSis to OniAi, around to Citrus and so forth. The problem with this series is that it not nowhere near well done as those other titles. I also don&#039;t understand the contrivance of initially showing the sister not knowing about the adoption situation. Why even bother and instead go with all parties involved knowing from the beginning ala KissxSis or something? KissxSis was not a good show by any means, but they understood what they were going for, and didn&#039;t bother with doing anything other than throwing the naughty stuff at the audience. It would be different for this series if there was any storytelling involved, but alas this point is basically the only non-ecchi related point even brought up. Just seems rather pointless. <br />
<br />
So basically there is no story beyond setting up the constant stream of dirty jokes. The problem becomes that they are not original in any means, and has been done so much better in other titles. I would credit this series, however, with having the apparent goal of throwing every trope possible at the audience. That&#039;s not really something to brag about though, at least not from my point of view. <br />
<br />
Art: 3<br />
This series is rather ugly, which seems to be in conflict with its attempt to come across as &#039;sexy&#039;. The characters have these huge ears sticking out which rides the line of nearly being distracting. The artwork overall seems cheap and makes me think it was hammered out in a hurry by interns or something. Even the naughty bits are underwhelming which is a problem considering that&#039;s the only hook the series is throwing out. <br />
<br />
The backgrounds are rather plain as well, though there is a few Easter eggs to be found in some of the scenes. Otherwise we&#039;re talking about a show that still looks rather cheap most of the time. <br />
<br />
Sound: 4<br />
The voice acting is like nails on a chalkboard for the most part, and is another element that is way too overblown. The girls are pitchy, and the guys that appear are too loud and seem to nearly always seem to be yelling. The only reason I put this at a 4 is because I do think both the opening and closing themes are not so bad. Otherwise, eek is the order of the day. <br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
The little sister, as we&#039;ve covered, is utterly consumed with her brocon ways. She also has the requisite rivalry going with the childhood friend, which like everything else, is over the top and cringe worthy a lot of the time. The childhood friend is just as overwrought, pulling the same CIA level of surveillance on the brother, complete to the point of keeping tabs on how many times he masturbates each day. These two are the type that sneak around in the bushes when the brother is dealing with anyone outside of them. <br />
<br />
The brother is your typical super horny teen, to the point he and his friends have created a porn sharing (ew!) &#039;club&#039; where they are so degenerate that they troll the neighborhood trash searching for porn mags. He&#039;s shown to be constantly obsessed with sex, yet for some reason never realizes that these girls are literally throwing themselves at him. He also develops several fetishes throughout the series, of which his sister records in a notebook of &#039;big brother&#039;s turn ons&#039;. He fails to notice that every time he changes his his preferences, the girls adjust accordingly. He&#039;s really clueless, though there is some humor to be had at his expense by a girl who blackmails him and forces him into embarrassing situations. <br />
<br />
Pretty much everyone in the cast is obsessed with some form of sexuality, ranging from porn collectors to the brocon girl to the creepy stalking childhood friend. In the end, of course no one gets any kind of closure and the whole thing is kind of left hanging. I&#039;m not real interested in whether or not he takes the sister to bed, or even the friend either, but there could have been some kind of hint of where things might have went after the end. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
This is another one of those series I don&#039;t really know why I finished. It being only 12 episodes probably helps, as I didn&#039;t have to devote a lot of time to watching it. I admit at moments it was mildly amusing, but that was far outweighed by the eye roll moments. The series tried to be sexy and failed and tried to be funny but ended up being tiresome. The glimmers of amusement is not by any means worth the price of purchase. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: the mysterious Mister X, aka Mayuka Kondou who actually does get one over on the brother, and puts him in some somewhat funny situations. By the end of the series she falls off a great deal, but for most of the time she&#039;s the only high point in this mess of a show. <br />
<br />
Really there are better uses of your time than this series. Might just check out a single episode so you can hear the fun themes, but otherwise you&#039;re just getting a bland experience filled with so many overused elements that its almost impressive in its mediocrity. I guess if you just *have* to watch tons of ecchi shows, then you might get something out of this one. Personally I say pass, instead go watch any number of other titles that this series tries to steal bits from. Forget not liking brother at all, since pretty much nothing is really likable in this one.

    Honestly, I found this anime to be the most disgusting thing I&#039;ve seen in a long time. I&#039;m not talking about the incest theme though as I actually like seeing plots revolve around touchy subjects like that, but there were multiple parts which literally had me staring with my jaw hanging. Although I can&#039;t say that that was always a bad thing. Some of it was gross in a more entertaining way.<br />
<br />
I might have liked it a bit more if the artwork wasn&#039;t so lousy and an actual plot existed but instead I got a load of &quot; Wtf is this?!&quot; thrown at me every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35634">
        week.<br />
<br />
Because of the shows long and forgettable name ( Well, at least to us western folk) I often reffered to it when speaking with my friends as &quot;Monkey Grenade&quot; because it&#039;s like watching a monkey swallow a grenade, you know whats about to happen is gonna be sick but you can&#039;t help but give in to that urge to look anyway. Perfect metaphor to describe this show if you ask me. ( Especially when you&#039;ve got your main character daydreaming about tentacle rape.)<br />
<br />
Most of the disgusting parts I speak of are mostly a result of the actions of the shows protaginist Shuusuke, a chronic masturbater with a serious porn addiction and the IQ of a walnut. Oh, and did I mention he belongs to a club of people who just as if not more perverted than him.  Thank god the really nasty stuff only happens in his imagination because otherwise I might have to sue the creator for emotional trauma.<br />
<br />
The other main character is his sister Nao who I think is incapable of applying logic to anything she does. Apparently she is in love with her brother which makes zero sense to me due to previously stated facts. The girl is fully aware of how messed up her brother is, and at one point when Shuusuke tries to become normal she does everything she can to keep him as the sicko he is. Yeah you read that right.<br />
<br />
Nao is supposed to be a main character, but all she does is stalk her brother every episode and do absolutely nothing to take the lead in the harem. Wait a minute, did I just say harem? Why, how on earth could a person like Shuusuke have a harem? Oh, but wait he does! He has a harem which includes a girl who is willing to do anything at anytime for him and yet he still chooses his right hand... <br />
<br />
After reading that I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be suprised to hear that I actually watched the whole thing. Despite how dreadful the shows characters are ( as well as their design) there were alot of momments that were actually watchable. Although an actual plot is absent here and the last few episodes were a let down compared to previous ones, I did in fact somewhat enjoy this. ( Although I&#039;d emphasize somewhat.)<br />
<br />
If you yourself are a huge pervert you&#039;ll enjoy this show! If not, your better off avoiding it altogether because honestly, I only kept watching this to kill time.

    This show is complicated. Really. If I had to compare it to something it would be Panty &amp; Stockings. Sometimes it is wrong, but sometimes it is so wrong it is funny. It walks a very thin line, and has a very small target audience. It is a satire of all ecchi in ways, and it is hard to tell if it has any intention to do so. The question that determines things would have to be; is a show trying to be so pathetic it is enjoyable good or bad? <br />
<br />
We follow the story of a small pathetic boy, who is tormented by a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38393">
        harem of women who for no reason promote his unnatural male desires. Despite being riddled with fanservice, this show has a &#039;different&#039; animation style: The characters are thin and tall and to the usual viewers eye, not very attractive. It takes a while to get used to new animation styles, and this is the case for Onii. However, what one needs to adjust to is the over the top things in this show. At the start things aren&#039;t so bad, but the episodes keep getting more and more pathetic. They introduce a new girl after every few episodes: a BL fan who blackmails and who flaunts her black stalkings, a childhood friend, a self proclaimed alien cosplayer… a sister. There is one guarantee though: They are all incredible perverts. No, there is nothing wrong with females having such desires, but the desires these females have… well they are wrong.<br />
<br />
Things can get interesting though when you place a lot of freaks in one place, and occasionally you get humor. Kondou&#039;s arc was one of the more enjoyable ones, as she is the most normal one apart from her BL obsession. So what happens when you get a AGE member, the males all belong to the All Genre Ero club, to enter the territory of boys love?<br />
<br />
There is no story to this show after Nao finds out she is not blood related to her brother. After that it is just one skit to another, revolving about whose ever turn it is to hog Shuusuke&#039;s attention.<br />
<br />
We come back to the point of what to make of pathetic entertainment. If you have a low tolerance for ecchi humor please do not attempt to watch this show.  If you are looking for fanservice, well the censors block out anything so don&#039;t bother (unless it is uncensored.) If you are looking for a harem, don&#039;t bother because none of the characters are likable. I am going to lean more towards the pathetic is bad side.

    Okay this is my first review so here it goes.  Let&#039;s see how can I put it, Onii-chan no Koto nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!! is a really fantastic anime and has surpassed some of my original expectations of the show.  Although I have only seen 6 episodes so far it has indeed pulled my interests in a bit further.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story I give a nine because although I&#039;ve seen other forms of &quot;sibling&quot; love this has a slight twist to them being &quot;siblings&quot; and they&#039;re are also other love rivals in the mix.  Always fun to see a boy torn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34469">
        between many women.  <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is a little different from my normal tastes.  The characters have a slighty lankyness about them, but what surprised me the most is that I have adapeted to viewing them that way.  It actually goes well with the story and is also very suitable to the characters themselves.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
I love the opening &quot;Taste of Paradise&quot; by Eri Kitamura it&#039;s very happy song and opens the anime brilliantly.  Also the ending &quot;Ari Ari Mirai&quot; (アリアリ未来☆) by Eri Kitamura, Marina Inoue, and Kazusa Aranami is also wonderfully done.  A very bright song it makes me want to sing it over and over again.  <br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Nao Tankanashi - 8<br />
A sister who is very determined to make her brother look at her and who also loves to watch him do perverted things.  She&#039;s very cute and has a bit of a sweet but not too overbearingly sour side to her.  <br />
<br />
Iroha Tsuchiura - 8<br />
Of course no story is complete without the childhood sweet heart, in our case a very stalkerish childhood sweet heart.  Iroha plays off the sweet part well, but deep down she&#039;s just as perverted as Shuusuke is.  <br />
<br />
Mayuka Kondou - 9<br />
The class rep and secret BL lover.  I like her style, although I&#039;m still uncertain what her true feels towards Shuusuke are, but the fact that she can make  him be her pet is glorious enough for me.<br />
<br />
Shuusuke Tananashi - 9<br />
Perverted, and sometimes looks weak under the foot of his sister, but who wouldn&#039;t be.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I really enjoy watching this series it took me by surprise at how much I actually laughed at watching some of the crazy antics that they do.  I really recommend it to anybody.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I&#039;m giving it a 9 it&#039;s prooved worthy enough.  It seems stereotypical but it&#039;s not so just give it a try and trust me you&#039;ll find it just as interesting too.<br />

    Definitely not an anime for the weak-willed. It’s such a laughtrip that if you’re not careful, you could end up being amused by things you wouldn’t have found funny under ordinary circumstances. It’s also got enough perversion that if you’re the hormonal type, you might actually start finding black pantyhose turn-on-worthy in real-life. More than once, in between a few episodes, you might find yourself asking why you’re putting up with this show despite its far-out, penguin-censored lewdness. But if you persevere, and make it to the final twenty minutes, there’s at least a 80% chance you’ll congratulate yourself on making the right decision of

    After watching this to start to finish, all I can say that this is a decent anime. It takes some episodes to get used to the character design, but once you get past this issue it won&#039;t be a very big problem.<br />
<br />
The plot itself isn&#039;t all that great. And the characters are good, you have Nao who likes to spy on her&#039;s perverted brother, and a lovely childhood friend who loves to stalk Shuusuke around and knows all about him. And then you have the class president who loves Yaoi manga or eroge. It isn&#039;t anything you are not used to from a ecchi anime.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35930">
        The only character in this anime I have a problem with is the main one.<br />
He is pretty perverted, although it can be very hilarious at times, but it gets very old halfway through the anime.<br />
<br />
You will get a good laugh of this anime, but other than that i can&#039;t offer you anything else

    I just watched half of the serie, time for a review, the first thing you will notice the second you start the serie, is off course the art style, it&#039;s just plain weird, once you get over that, if you enjoy those themes:comedy,harem,ecchi,school, you might enjoy it, but there&#039;s so much better out there with those same themes.<br />
<br />
The story is a very cliché one, but the goal of this anime is to be funny, and they manage it, the sounds are good, the characters are ok, nothing special.<br />
<br />
if you want some infos about the story, here it is. It&#039;s about a very perverted young boy(he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34562">
        is in a p0rn magazine club at his school) and don&#039;t ask me why, his sister(which is not his real sister) is in love with him, and the apparition of a childhood friend of him and the class president of his class who is a yaoi addict(of course they are in love with him) creating a lot of very funny moments.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for some comedy, take it a look, it&#039;s worth some laughs, but the content is very poor, I gave it a 6, it&#039;s enjoyable, but nothing amazing.<br />
<br />
have a nice day
