    Adaptation of video games has always been a recurring trend in today’s anime industry. Each year, new anime series makes it to the market based on previous successes of its original material. There have been some successes but also failures in terms of achieving satisfactory results of adaptations. Where does BlazBlue: Alter Memory stand at on the satisfaction scale? If I had to judge this show on an overall scale of 100, it would be at 40. This is an anime series that shows exactly how not to adapt an anime series. It’s an example that made itself look like a joke that’s not even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125435">
        funny.<br />
<br />
BlazBlue: Alter Memory is an anime series based off of the games, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger and BlazBlue: Continuum Shift. As an adaptation expansion, one would expect deep character development and an intriguing plot right? Wrong. This show has none of that so don’t expect any well development of its story. What it does have though is a trail of poor writing made of its weakly developed characters, mediocre action, and overall an execution gone wrong.<br />
<br />
The series is pretty straight forward at first with a main character named Ragna the Bloodedge. We literally know almost nothing about him besides the fact that he looks like some cool character based off a video game complete with the generic scarlet coat, white hair, and expressions of an indifferent man. We later find out that he is a wanted criminal with a large bounty placed on him. He is the prey and other characters in the series seeks his head to claim glory and prize. We also know for a fact that he is armed with a weapon known as the Azure Grimoirethe. As oddly as the name sounds, it does provide the guy what he needs to get by especially when he faces characters such as Jin Kisaragi. <br />
<br />
For an opening episode, the show doesn’t make strong impression with its presentation. The way it sets the series up spells out many confusion especially for anime-only viewers. This includes the relations Ragna has with Noel Vermillion, a young girl and former lieutenant of the Novus Orbis Librarium. For whatever reason, Noel becomes his companion as a sorts although the latter mostly ignores her. There’s a complete lack of compatibility between them in terms of characteristics, relationship, and personality. To make matters worse, we also find out that Ragna’s reason for being hunted down relates to an organization that we barely have any keen knowledge of: NOL. <br />
<br />
However, that’s not the end of the trail of disgrace this series continues to run on. Apparently, Ragna the Bloodedge also has a dark past for which he was involved with a young boy, girl, along with a fire. A lot of events later come together like a puzzle but none of the pieces fit. It’s a mess that is hardly fluid because it introduces too many events with characters in a story that just doesn’t make much sense. Speaking of characters, the series does have a wide diversity of them that comes in all shapes and sizes such as a squirrel girl, transmogrifying cat, bat familiars, and cyborgs. Although they fit well with a fantasy theme such as Blaz Blue, most of them hardly develops the story. From what I understand, there are various routes in the original games. However, this how only seems to focus on our main characters Ragna, Jin, and Noel. It destroys any meaning of development for our supporting characters as they seemingly gets pushed aside. The reason I can think of for this type of presentation might be because the show is only one cour with 12 episodes. Still, this is just a weak execution to construct the concept of this show.<br />
<br />
The only hope I had for this show is perhaps some sort of world building considering the setting this show takes place in. The setting of BlazBlue is interesting with artistic visuals and a direction that might point to its development. In fact, sudden places in this world reflects its fantasy setting perfectly and something out of a video game, which exactly it is based off of. More so, most of the characters are designed to look like something crafted out of a game. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that hope is dashed by stereotypical themes of this series’ style. Ever heard of the concept involving destroying a system to end the world? If so, then this show will definitely not leave you any decent memories for what’s to come. The characters that comes after Ragna for his head is about as cliched as you’ll see. Antagonists such as Hazama is decorated with stereotypical style such as his green hair (because it looks cool in for artistic purposes), his poker face smile, and sarcastic tone of voice. Stereotype might be a word that people dislike to hear but this show doesn’t avoid going down that road at all.<br />
<br />
The series also attempts to add in episodes to calm down the mood and diverge even from its main story. Although it isn’t colored as an ecchi series because of minimal fan service, BlazBlue: Alter Memory still incorporates the usage of a typical onsen episode; and for a ludicrous reason too! The character relationships in this series is also unrealistic and hard to get attached to. Noel has some sort of odd attachment to Ragna that is never fully understood. Otherwise, there is one other character in the series that makes a short debut that shares some intimate moments with Ragna. Unfortunately, the way the series writes that off tries to present tragedy but ends up feeling liked a rushed sequence with almost no purpose. At some instances, the series also tries to bring out emotional values with these ‘tragedy’ scenes to the series but this is vaguely explored between our supporting characters. You won’t need tissues because tears will not be shed. Instead, you’ll likely be asking yourself questions with answers given that are completely rushed with mass info dumps. It is coordinated in the wrong way with its set up and in general lacks a structural set up.<br />
<br />
Action wise, the series is decent at best. The fast movements accompanied by its OST is tolerable in some sense. It portrays its game aesthetics in a way that gives off some purpose. Ragna is the type of guy that rushes into battle without thinking with his hotheaded attitude while wielding his ridiculous giant sword. As generic as this sounds, Ragna also holds some form of honor with his opponents as he doesn’t fight to kill or try to make a name for himself; if he hasn’t yet already anyways. <br />
<br />
The artwork of BlazBlue seems fitting, at least for its world setting anyways. However, the characters looks generic. Ragna the Bloodedge looks exactly as he is with little development. Noel Vermillion has that appearance of a young girl dressed in a way like she is from school with her blue uniform complete with a beret. Other characters has some artistic values of diversity such as Rachel Alucard, the head of the vampire clan. Unfortunately, they stand out nothing more than blend designs. They are like cardboard box characters made from recycled material. Now only if the characters themselves can be more useful together the story together and hold things together like a box. Unfortunately, it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
There’s nothing noteworthy about the soundtrack besides the OST during the fight scenes. Both the OP and ED songs have some tendency to keep itself together but nothing remarkable. While the voices of a few characters fits their roles well, all of them stands out as in odd mannerisms. Ragna’s deep voice also occasionally sounds arrogant while Noel’s tone can be annoying to listen to with her femininity. The main problem with most of the characters’ voices is the fact that most of them don’t have personalities. The dialogues spoken throughout the series also holds hardly any value and most of them come out as cheesy and inconsistent.<br />
<br />
BlazBlue: Alter Memory is an adaptation that didn&#039;t just go wrong but self-destructed itself from the very beginning. It’s rushed, lacks characterization thanks to its cliched characters, has a damaged story that is beyond repair, and confusing execution. Some technical aspects of the series does save it from complete annihilation but this show is ultimately a case where you’ll need a lot of patience to get through. If somehow you make it through, there’s a likely case of disappointment. Thankfully, the series is only 12 episodes so it won’t take too long to get through. I just hope it won’t leave a painful memory that you’ll remember by.<br />

    This anime is based on the video games  BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger and BlazBlue: Continuum Shift. Although I haven&#039;t played any of this games I&#039;ll still write this review about the anime. So if you have played the games you may have a different perspective about it.<br />
<br />
Story 3/10:<br />
Well to begin with the review i should tell you about the story. The first episode started with a fight. In this episode i couldn&#039;t found an explanation about whats was going on or why. And even after the first episode the only information i could found was about the main character and it was very short. Only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135245">
        after 6 or 7 episodes there was an explanation about the world in which the story was taking place. But even after the last episode the story leaved many plot holes. I don&#039;t know if playing the game could have give you some context about the characters or the world, but if you haven&#039;t play them you will end up with a lot of questions after the anime ends.<br />
<br />
Art 5/10:<br />
I didn&#039;t like the art so much. The character&#039;s designs where very plain. They didn&#039;t leave any kinda of impression in me. Not even the main character. Also the backgrounds looked really dull. Even the fights were not as intense as they could be.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10: (btw i watched it in JP wiht EN subs)<br />
Well the sound wasn&#039;t bad but wasn&#039;t good either. I liked the opening, it was very cool. But the ending was very dull, and the art didn&#039;t help at all. <br />
About the characters voices, they were good enough, although i found some of them annoying, like Hazama&#039;s voice. And the background music didn&#039;t match the environment. Not even the fights sound were loud or intense enough so it make them kinda dull.<br />
<br />
Character 3/10:<br />
The main problem i could find in every character is the lack of context and background information. From the main characters to the last of the supporting characters, they just keep appearing with out any kind of explanation about their role in the story. Also i couldn&#039;t see any grow in any of the character, nor in their personalities or in their powers. Only in the last 2 episodes you can see some changes. And i found one of the character very annoying, although i guess it was intended to be like that since he is the bad guy.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10:<br />
I didn&#039;t enjoy watching this anime. I got pissed with every episode because i couldn&#039;t understand what was going on in the story. Not even the fights were good enough to watch a full episode. But since i wanted an explanation about the full story i kept watching it.<br />
<br />
The overall score for the anime should be a 4/10. I wouldn&#039;t stop you from watching it if you have played any of the games, because you may have a different experience with the anime, but I would&#039;t recommend it to anyone.

    Story<br />
<br />
First off BB: Alter Memory is based off the popular fighting game series BlazBlue. The series adapts the first two games in the series Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift and crams it in a 12 episode anime! The story starts off with our main hero Ragna the Bloodegde fighting some creepy robot girl named Nu.  Ragna gets stabbed by Nu and we&#039;re introduced to a gothic princess girl and her butler taking about the event that just took place and the outcome of the situtation. We then see more character that are introduced and we don&#039;t know anything about them only we can infer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131045">
        who they are. And those are the assumptions people can piece together. But long story short the story is a convoluted mess that newbies who never played the games would be confused as hell and the fans will be very disappointed.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
The characters retain their personalities from the original source but their are convoluted in the relationship area and are just thrown out there just to make an appearance but disappears for the rest of the series. You will be asking questions like why are Noel and Ragna comrades?, how are Rachel and Ragna connected to each other? How Jin knows Tsubaki? Why is Litchi worried about Arakune? and many more.  The characters in the series are unique and very interesting but the show throws away the opportunity to develop them and make the audience relate more to them. <br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
<br />
Before I get to the art I have to get the animation out of the way.  Like Fairy Tail the series has some cheap animation but unlike FT it drag the series down some more.  Every time there&#039;s a sword fight there&#039;s a lightning like light too cover up the lacking animation. Also who can forget the infamous ice brick Jin shot out in episode 1. But the only piece of high quality of animation is in episode 2 when Noel summons Bolverk.  The art on the other hand isn&#039;t special but comes off as generic.  There&#039;s nothing really distinctiful about the character designs.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The background music is mediocre and forgettable. Some of the tracks are reused from the games.  Except when there fight scenes the music is fairly good but still forgettable.  The opening shows more of how the series is on a cheap budget since it&#039;s all rehashed scenes from the episodes and the song is okay but not a remarkable one. Same goes for the ending.  The voice acting is average but I&#039;m not those people who treats the Japanese language like its a Holy language.  Kanako Kando sounds a bit annoying as Noel and it did bother me at times in the series and I felt Kana Ueda didn&#039;t sound aristocratic and condescending as Rachel and sounded a bit bland.  But the only stand out is Tetsuya Kakihara as Jin who retains his ability to voice the sociopathic Jin.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
The series can be enjoyable if you turned your brain off and watch only for the action which is decent.  But from a critical point of view you would be irritated.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
In the end Blazblue Alter Memory is just a huge disappointment and and confusing mess to fans and newcomers. Advice to newcomers just go buy the games and enjoy a more coherent and understandable story.  The show is just mediocre at best.  I only time I&#039;ll be rewatching this is if the original English voice cast comes back to voice the characters. If you want a better anime adaptation of a video game watch Persona 4 The Animation.   It has better character development, animation, and story that even newcomers can understand.  <br />

    As a fan of the games, this kind of half-hearted cynical half-baked crap that Hoods presented, appalls me.<br />
<br />
Game Anime Adaptations! If you&#039;ve been hanging around the community for long enough, you may notice a trend. Anime adaptations of video games don&#039;t exactly have a good rep (not as bad as movie adaptations to be honest). Sure, some like say, Persona 4 The Animation, do a good job adapting the story and characters, while putting decent production values into the music, acting, and animation, but then we get shows like Blazblue Alter Memory. Shows that botch the story, wreck the characters, and overall, not give enough

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218315">
        of a damn to satisfy the fans who clamored for its existence. Let&#039;s expand on this one.<br />
<br />
If you know about the games this anime was based on (Blazblue Calamity Trigger, and Blazblue Continuum Shift), then you&#039;d know about the many different paths and endings they have, and with exception to the Calamity Trigger Reconstruction found in an updated version of Continuum Shift known as Continuum Shift Extend, the games challenge you to determine what goes where in order to piece together the true chronology of the games (and feel like a genius in the process). The anime decided to make a lot of changes; none of which are acceptable (with one exception that goes under episode 11 spoilers). The first episode condensed so much, in such choppy and cumbersome fashion, that it almost guarantees fans to be pissed. The first game had enough canon content for approximately 6 episodes,and the second game he even more content, over double that of the former. This adds up to about 20 episodes worth of content to adapt, meaning they could easily separate this into a 6-episode mini-series and a full-cour sequel. <br />
<br />
The first game&#039;s storyline is cleared in the first 2 &amp; 1/2 episodes. This meant, rushing a lot of the early parts of that story, along with cutting things out entirely. Then, certain subplots of BOTH GAMES were removed entirely, seeing as they take up to past the third game to resolve. This means, we only have 10 and 1/2 episodes worth of canon material left. So, we got 2 pseudo-filler episodes to permeate what&#039;s left of the 12 episode run-time, which automatically damned the story, given how much there was to adapt. Hell, the two pseudo-filler episodes could&#039;ve spent some time world building like in the games, but I bet Production I.G. was too busy counting all that Psycho Pass money to bother. Then again, they gave this to Hoods, so, whatever. <br />
<br />
This anime is also a terrible place for newcomers since the anime offers too many changes, and it&#039;s also marred by awful pacing that makes it actually even harder for anyone to understand than the games, including the fans, and that&#039;s just sad. Episodes 1 and 2 are especially guilty of this, with episode 1 speeding through about 4 episodes worth of content, and episode 2 slowing down dramatically compared to the pacing of episode 1, making it feel like the show hit the brakes after realizing how fast it was going. Certain motivations and story elements don&#039;t add up, and the changes, most of them range from unnecessary to downright damaging, only compound this issue, along with the issues of the next category. But before we head there, I must also mention that with the amount of stuff they cut out (more than 1/2 of the important subplots) it would be impossible to adapt the third game and make it fit with this anime. They&#039;d have to go the Tokyo Ghoul Root A route of making up new things due to how far gone it was, and given the actual quality of the series, adaptation quality aside, I don&#039;t think they could pull that off, in the off chance that they get that sequel after all.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the main protagonist, Ragna, as he gets the worst treatment here. In the games, he was a badass/jerkass who always knew what witty insults and rebuttals to come up with. He often was subjected to ridicule among a majority among the other characters, and coupled with his harsh backstory, you couldn&#039;t help but feel sorry for the guy, especially since he&#039;s actually a pretty great guy if you&#039;re not an asshole to him (for most part), well, gruesome 1-man rebellion aside. Here, if you know the personality of New Dante/Donte (BrainScrachComms reference)/Dante from DMC Devil May Cry, you can see where the anime screwed Ragna up. It might be closer to how he was initially portrayed in the first game, but that doesn&#039;t make him less unlikable early on, and actually kind of switches by the 2nd half with no real warning. His development is confusing and nonsensical, he is somewhat less sharp with the tongue, yet much more of a prick, and not likable here at all, even with the backstory, well except for episode 8. It&#039;s as if they wanred to reflecr how his characterization started changing from the first game to the second, but without any actual breathing room to have that work. <br />
<br />
Most of the others have major flaws I won&#039;t even begin to point out, lest this review become insanely tedious to make. A lot of them are also either watered down, missing distinct personality traits from the games, or given new traits that either clash with the characters, or just come off as jarring like most characters, Makoto Nanaya, and Imperator Librarius respectively. Only a few characters suffered little damage, and the only improved character from the source material is Lambda-11, given how little screen time she had.<br />
<br />
The production values aren&#039;t much better. The object models (most of them anyway) look on par with some anime around 2013, but that&#039;s the only praise this&#039;ll get. The character models look more generic and odd, almost annoying, especially since they are rife with animation mistakes, and you will most certainly notice them and how awful hey are. Unfortunately, there are a wild amount of lip-synching problems (in the SUB no less in 2013 where studios have normally fixed that issue to a decent extent) which bog down the animation front, and given a 12 episode series done in 2013, this is inexcusable. The fights are horrendous as well. Sure some of the later ones are borderline passable albeit still very generic, but the first and last 2 battles are all dreadful, suffering from terrible choreography, random ass mini explosions due to regular poles and swords tapping the ground (no extra supernatural or sci-fi stuff to them, just plain ol&#039;  swords and poles being swung),  attacks that don&#039;t behave like in the game, and random likes drawn whenever characters battle in a top down perspective, despite the fact that nothing is flashing! Just... DBZ spam (minus flashy attacks and blasts) that way they don&#039;t have to animate good fight scenes. This proves that this doesn&#039;t just fail as an adaptation, it fails as an action show in general. How sad that the animated cutscenes for the third game Blazblue Chronophantasma (which came out mere months before this garbage did). I get that Hoods was the one responsible for this show, but goddamn, at least TRY to make your characters look good!<br />
<br />
So, as established, this show is a dumpster fire. Yet, for all my bitching about this series, at least the music staff realized how important this project was. Not only did we get great remixes of the original tracks, but they even cover different music genres! Hell, since certain characters and confrontations only got their own theme in the third game (which came out only a few months before the anime did), those themes were incorporated to the great library of music in this anime. Plus, the OP and ED were both great; just what we&#039;d expect from this franchise. The dub, while not as good as any of the games, it&#039;s still pretty decent. Sure some characters like Nu-13 and Taokaka went in less than stellar directions, but the ADR Director, Patrick Seitz, who voices Ragna no less, managed to at least salvage some of the dialogue. Some of the other performances were also pretty good as well, even if not all characters were given the same good direction as in the games, despite having the same voice actors as the third game, which also got dubbed before this. Plus, this anime&#039;s awful adaptation of the character designs doesn&#039;t really let them lend well towards English voices. Well, the sound`s good, and that’s something I suppose.<br />
<br />
Despite the great music, and decent dub, I still heavily disliked this anime, to put it lightly. The 1st and 11th episodes pissed me off to Haruhi Season 2 levels, and most of the episodes, barring episode 8, weren&#039;t very entertaining either. The horrid fights don&#039;t help much either. It was a borderline depressing experience of pain and fury, and barring one episode, each episode made me feel that way, and boy do I never wanna come back.<br />
<br />
All in all, this was a horrendous series that exemplified most of what a bad video game adaptation is. The fights sucked thanks to abysmal choreography and choices, the characters sucked due to being generic in this version, the story sucked for a variety of reasons, and overall, was a very intolerable experience, even with the small flashes of actual quality here and there. In fact, it feels like Hoods either or little effort or simply did not know how to do this at all and just have yo whole throwing shut st the screen, even gutting its source in the process. It feels heartless and soulless. Newcomers should stay away, at least until playing the games, since this did not show off how an anime version of Blazblue would truly be like, let alone what an action series should be like thanks to its abysmal production values and lack of regard to literally anything other than a decent OST. Well, hopefully, whenever the final game comes out, someone can adapt this series properly. Until then, we have some games to play. With that, I bid you adieu.

    I would like to provide some of my insights on this show, as a viewer who had not played any of the BlazBlue games. At the very least, I had watched a few gameplay videos of them on YouTube.<br />
 <br />
STORY: 3/10 Poor<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this series is created with the sole assumption of: the viewers had already played the games before, and are very knowledgable about the plot. And if you happen to be like me who did not meet this requirement, then there’s a very high chance that even after finishing this series, you don’t even know what BlazBlue is.<br />
<br />
That is how bad the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125793">
        story is. Tons of terminology were thrown around, yet there is hardly any explanations to them, not until the very end. But what’s the point of dumping info so late, when the viewer had already been so confused all along? <br />
<br />
Perhaps some sort of narration would solve this issue, but there’s no such thing here. <br />
<br />
If you haven’t played BlazBlue before, and for some reason have a sudden urge to confuse yourself, watch Alter Memory.<br />
<br />
ART: 5/10 Mediocre<br />
<br />
For an adaptation of an action-heavy fighting game, this series really undermined all the badassery of the original games. This could be due to the lack of budget from the animation studio, which is painfully obvious as you watch this series. <br />
<br />
How so? Well… for starters, the OP of the show did not even have its own animation in the first 3 episodes, instead taking a few scenes from the first episode and putting them together. The ED is just a rotating wheel of static characters.<br />
<br />
Fighting scenes are watered down that action fans will find them really unsatisfying. Early on, these scenes were so short that there were like, less than 3 clashes between both sides before the battle had ended. Battles lasted a bit longer in the end, but still pretty dull-looking when what supposed to be a super-awesome mega showdown between the world’s strongest had become some half-assed brawl at your local tavern. <br />
<br />
You are better off playing the games or watching some gameplay videos of YouTube if you want a more entertaining battle.<br />
<br />
Characters wise, they look okay (without comparing them to their game counterparts), as their designs are indeed rather unique, only that I often feel that Ragna is too thin. Sceneries are nothing spectacular, but fits the setting well. The entire show at least looks balanced with no awkward or out-of-place objects. <br />
<br />
Okay characters, okay sceneries and very bad action scenes sum up the art section.<br />
<br />
 SOUND: 7/10 Good<br />
<br />
This could well be Alter Memory’s best section. We have an all-star cast of seiyuus, in which I believe did their job well enough to keep me going. Yuuichi Nakamura’s my personal favorite here as he made Hazama the most vibrant character in the series. <br />
<br />
The background music is pretty good, especially the ones used during the fight scenes, which are composed of blood-pumping rock music. <br />
<br />
The same cannot be said to the sound effects, which often times, doesn’t sound right, most notably explosions, which doesn’t really sound like explosions.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 4/10 Bad<br />
<br />
We have a bunch of potentially likable characters in Alter Memory, but the story did not do them justice, leaving them as empty husks until the very end, where we hardly get to know any of their personalities. It’s hard to get attached to these characters solely by watching this show. The only character that left me some impression is Hazama, as annoying as his laugh is, at least he’s distinctive. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 4/10 Bad<br />
<br />
Funny as it seems, I always find myself returning to every Wednesday to watch this show. I can’t really say it’s enjoyable with all the confusion going along, but at the same time, perhaps curiosity had gotten the best of me back then. But then, was I satisfied? Hell no. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 4/10 Bad<br />
<br />
The only reason I chose to watch this is because I at least knew what BlazBlue is, and is curious on how an anime adaptation will turn out. Unfortunately the low quality adaptation really undermined this popular fighting series, that perhaps it would be wise to skip past this one, and watch something else. <br />

    When you watch any adaptation from books, light novels, comics, video games, visual novels, whatever media, you expect to find a nice story. It could be original but taking the elements of the source, it could be faithful to their primary source or just take the basic elements but don&#039;t try to explain them clearly. Blazblue Alter Memory is one of those cases where it is a wasted potential and it is used to hype the fans of the game and let them know that they took this franchise just to exploit and grab some money. I am pretty dissapointed to the point that I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124395">
        even drop it. Something I usually don&#039;t do but HECK! this one cross the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY = 1<br />
<br />
What can I say? It is just pure dialog. To explain how I felt with the story is simple. It&#039;s just pure talking and some action between it. They don&#039;t try to make a story, they just talk about it. Then someone gets angry and then fight. It becomes dull and pretty stupid. Nothing else to add.<br />
<br />
ART = 7<br />
<br />
The art looks pretty good. Not that awesome but it is ok. The brightness used it&#039;s ok. But nothing to fancy. It stands with today&#039;s anime standards.<br />
<br />
Sound = 4<br />
<br />
The voice actors  felt pretty flat. They just talk. They don&#039;t try to pull the character to it&#039;s potential and they just say what the script contains and it keeps on and on. That&#039;s a sad point because looking at the people they hired we can see that Sugita Tomokazu (Gintama, Haruhi, Kanon, Hachimitsu to Clover) at least could give to the character more emotion but meh. Also there is no distinctive OST.The opening is acceptable and it&#039;s good also the ending. Nothing more.<br />
<br />
Character = 1<br />
<br />
They are flat, incosistent and pale.They are just there to say that there is a story. But we can see an emo that wants revenge, another emo that hates the emo protagonist, a clumsy blonde. a pseudo-vampire girl, a bad guy that yells for everything, a geek-hikkikomori-girl, a loli, a boy that looks somehow like a girl (even he has a girl&#039;s voice) and many other anime stereotypes which they are not likeable. They don&#039;t progress at all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment = 2<br />
<br />
Since episode 1 I dislike it. But I give it a 2 just because some battles where nice but they could not make the show stand. The characters suck. If you ask me this show doesn&#039;t have plot. Anything else is just pure meh. But without a story and good characters anything else is pure garbage and it&#039;s just decoration. The last complain that I have is that they can&#039;t even use fan service right and when you can&#039;t do that correctly you know you have made an obnoxious, putrefied, filthy creation that shouldn&#039;t be known for the rest of the existance.<br />
<br />
OVERALL = 1<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch it. It&#039;s an insult to video game-anime adaptations, an insult to their fans because it will make the game look bad and an insult to everyone that wants to entertain but they don&#039;t even try to.<br />
<br />
Well thanks for reading. Sorry if I had grammar issues but English isn&#039;t my first language. Take care in everything that you do.

    Anime made of a video game called blazblue. As a fan of the series i was able to enjoy this show for what it is but if you aren&#039;t familiar with blazblue universe this maybe isn&#039;t the best place to start. Most of the characters backgrounds won&#039;t be told and you are just assumed to know who they are and why they are doing it. However BlazBlue: Alter Memory gives it&#039;s viewer great fighting scenes and good music. Sometimes the animation is sub-par but mostly it&#039;s good. So at the end recommending this anime is hard, because it almost requires it&#039;s viewer to know the

    An anime that comes from a game, very easy to say it like that. BllazBlue is for my opnion very good , as I became an addict off it now.<br />
As for the story, the first episode is hard too understand, as it just begins in a random lava thing, as the guy named Ragna the bloodedge gets killed and so on, It gets many off us confused.<br />
What I did notice is that it mostly goes around the game Continuum Shift (The only game I als o own) Some parts, Ragna sudden gets somewhere only by walking, and than fights someone is very confusing either.<br />
The anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126859">
        is something you full need to concentrate on watching or else you will be completely lost but for people who dropped it for 3 episodes I can certian say watch more, as the story devolepment  it gets better and some parts finally make more sense.. <br />
What is too bad about it , is that they do not start at the beginning, now I do not know about it either from any games. But how it would help more too understand the storyline, than start in the middle.<br />
<br />
As characters, are very good, they each have there own painfull memories and grudges again one another. <br />
<br />
But if you are a BlazBlue fan, just watch it till the end and say than how you liked it. As for no idea what it is, first search up information. <br />
<br />
I hope I could help people and convincing too watch it anyway.<br />

    Funny story here, I first found out about this anime while I was staring at Rachel&#039;s artwork with a drop of precum spewing out of my urethra when after scratching my anus because I forgot to wipe and what greeted me as I prepared to sniff my prize was an anime.<br />
<br />
That anime was Blazblue: Alter Memory.<br />
<br />
Calamity Trigger&#039;s story remains to be the high point of the games in terms of storytelling and intrigue. It introduced a brand new world and provided the groundwork for an entire saga of games to work from.<br />
<br />
This anime does not of that and manages to squander any potential that an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320826">
        animated adaptation would cover the entire game&#039;s story. The potential for something was really there, at least in concept.<br />
<br />
There are some positives. I liked the episode where the characters got into swimsuits. Seeing Rachel&#039;s snatch as a preteen let me bust my first nut. So I guess that&#039;s the best part of the anime.<br />
<br />
Verdict:<br />
Did it insult me? Yes.<br />
Did I pop a boner? Yes.<br />

    This Anime is a video game adaptation and i get that it makes more sense if youve played the games. But that is not an excuse for poor story writing shit character development. Character relationships no one can understand. It flat out garbage i had to force myself to watch the end of it. To be honest i feel like it could have been a good anime if you know they actually started from the beginning or explained anything lol dont bother watching its a waste of time! Also i very rarely say that about any anime but this was real bad!

    Wasted potential is this anime in a nutshell. It had the ability to become a fantastic anime with a decent plot, but a rushed story-line and a lack of background ruin everything it could&#039;ve been.<br />
<br />
[Story - 4/10] The anime disappoints right off the bat by failing to inform the watcher why the hell the main character is destroying all the shit he is. All we know that he&#039;s the main character and he&#039;s supposed to be the good guy, but it never tells us why. Furthermore, it never goes into depth about what powers people have, and where they originate from. The prime fields are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125781">
        another example out of the dozens of random stuff that are in this anime. You have to have either read the plot summaries on the wiki page or have actually played the game to understand any of this. A similar comparison would be Danganronpa, which aired earlier this year. Despite both games coming from a video game background, Dangan actually manages to explain what&#039;s going on in the anime. Granted, Blazblue is a much more complicated world, but at least one episode spent on explaining everything would&#039;ve been nice. <br />
<br />
[Art - 7/10] It&#039;s actually pretty nice, but there&#039;s a large lack of diversity in the characters, and nothing outstanding.<br />
<br />
[Sound - 6/10] The OP and ED are alright I guess, but each of the character&#039;s voices sound waaay off from what they should be (Jin sounds like a 15 year old girl sometimes).<br />
<br />
[Character - 4/10] As far as I know, none of the characters are explained at all, and thus it&#039;s hard to base any changes throughout the anime on what they were in the beginning. Why does Jin want to kill his brother? Why does Ragna hate Noel&#039;s face despite her looking like his long lost sister?? None of these things are explained well, and it hurts the anime as a whole.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment - 6/10] Despite this harsh criticism, I still watched the anime to it&#039;s completion. However. If you truly want to enjoy the anime, I highly recommend reading the wiki page and spoiling it a bit, otherwise you won&#039;t understand a thing.<br />
<br />
Overall the anime isn&#039;t terrible on it&#039;s own, but coupled with the lack of information about the world they&#039;re in, as well as the backgrounds of all the characters, it loses out on many of the animes that came out this season. However, if you ever have time to burn, try this anime out, but be ready to be confused as hell unless you read the wiki.

    First: this is my first ever review here on MAL,  Second: As a diehard BlazBlue fan I&#039;ll write what is wrong with the anime (I&#039;ll relate it with the game) and as an anime watcher I&#039;ll write what is right/wrong with this series.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
The good &#039;ol BlazBlue story, the setting is nearly identical to the game, the story is pretty.... umh, RUSHED.<br />
So the anime starts with one of the Time Loops that happened in Calamity Trigger, nothing bad here, the second episode is another time loop that cover the True Ending. Yes. The 90% first game completely skipped. The anime starts with the true

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121707">
        ending of the first game. Since episode three it starts the second game, Continuum Shift using parts (adapted into anime in wrong way of course) from the Noel Route and Ragna Route, now it comes the good part, episode 4. HALF OF THE EPISODE IS A BEACH EPISODE, A BEACH EPISODE,  did that ever happen in the game? NO.  Not only this anime rushes important events, IT ADDS USELESS PARTS, well you can call it fanservice IF ONLY the animation didn&#039;t sucked.<br />
The rest of the episodes since now are a mixup of the various route in CS with many adapting error (Episode 6 has a fight that happens near the end of Jin Kisaragi route, and episode 6 is &quot;based&quot; off the very first part of his route)<br />
What to say, the story is rushed and bad adapted sometimes. But at least is the same as the game.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
Oh boy oh boy, the animation sucks.<br />
The chara design does not have that BlazBlue feeling that the game or other BB animation had, for example Jin in the game artworks is what you can call a bishonen and here looks like your average an angsty teen. <br />
Another example is the MC: Ragna, take the  Ragna of the artworks (or the one that appears in the anime openings such as the Madhouse&#039;s Continuum Shift Extend opening) he looks grumpy as hell and here in the animation looks like... a bishonen from some random otome. <br />
What I&#039;m trying to say this art style is not good for a series like BlazBlue, the only character that fits this style is Hazama.<br />
As for the actual animation its pretty bad, sometimes the expression of the characters goes derp and such similiar problems.<br />
A good thing though are the fights (but they lose points because of the animation) and the special effects that appear a lot of times through the series<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
A really good thing that this anime has to offer is the sound, most of the soundtrack are very well done remixes from the original games, the Opening theme is pretty cool and the Ending is not bad, as for the voice acting there are no problems since the voice actors are the same from the game.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
The characters are the same identical from the game, but there isn&#039;t as much development here like in the game.<br />
Anyways there is not much to say here<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: 6<br />
<br />
As a BlazBlue fan, this anime is bad, REALLY BAD, as an anime watcher I could say that is watchable if I didn&#039;t play the games.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
There are many problems in these series mostly because this is a 12 episode anime adaptation of two games, there&#039;s no other way but to rush the events.<br />
The animation is bad compared to the other show this season, but needless to say this could easily be one of the best anime adaptation from a game (Little Bust**s, Dangan***pa: the Animation miserably failed as many other adaptations) , because the studio (and from what I know is a little studio) is trying to take events from like 17 routes of a game and adapting in 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
So this ends my first review, since english is not my language I&#039;m pretty sure that there are lots of typos (100% sure), and maybe I went too much against the anime because of my love for the games, anyways I hope that this review is helpful for someone.

    &quot;I am the white void. I am the cold steel. I am the just sword. With blade in one hand shall I reap the sins of this world and cleanse it in the fires of destruction. I am mercury1980. The end has come to this game adaptation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Too bad I did this review since it finished aired in the end of 2013. I&#039;m late to the party. Speaking of which, I am going to review &quot;Blazeblue: Alter Memory&quot; a video game adaptation by the name BlazBlue. I guess you all have heard the reviews saying that the game adaptation &quot;Blazblue: Alter Memory&quot; is a train wreck.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139209">
        Let&#039;s not beat around the bush here, anime is crap.<br />
<br />
Before I say what this anime is, I haven&#039;t played the Blazblue game. This is a critique on the anime itself.<br />
<br />
The anime  was directed by Hideki Tachibana who so far never directed any good anime. He was also responsible for Higurashi Kira, the OVA which completely butchered the characters and using a lot of perverted humor which is unfunny.<br />
<br />
STORY (3):<br />
<br />
The story takes place in year 2199, where Humanity waits for the dawn of the new century where a series of devastating magical warfare ends. It is up to Ragna the Bloodedge to save the day and basically that&#039;s all there is.<br />
<br />
You don&#039;t go into this anime for a deep story. You just go into this anime to see awesome action scenes. The problem is the story is all over the place. There was a fight between Hakumen and Ragna in the beginning of episode 2 and suddenly we jump to the scene where Ragna rescues Noel Vermillion. In episode 4, we see Hakumen being tied up by Kokonoe. How did that even happen? We never see Haukmen in episode 3 but here he is tied up in episode 4? <br />
<br />
The dialogues were hilariously bad. Just like Hakumen say &quot;Before my powers, your measly powers are insignificant&quot;. Hakumen just never say how Ragna can improve. The most entertaining part of the show is during the duel between Ragna and Hakumen. <br />
<br />
Some of the episodes are filler including episode 5 where Taokaka brings Ragna, Noel and Faye-Ling to the hot springs. There&#039;s no need for that. Anyway, let&#039;s move on to the animation.<br />
<br />
ART (2):<br />
<br />
The animation is blur and not pleasing to see. Maybe the budget is too low. But the animation will not affect the overall grade.<br />
<br />
SOUND (5): <br />
<br />
The opening and ending are ok. The opening had this rock and roll feeling just like I had with &quot;No pain, No game&quot; by Nano. The opening is &quot;Blaz Blue&quot; by Faylan.<br />
<br />
The ending is &quot;Reincarnation Blue&quot; by Aira Yuuki.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (1):<br />
<br />
Haha. Oh boy the characters. <br />
<br />
All the time, Ragna puts on this angry stern look. He is always never happy. He&#039;s either sad or he&#039;s hurt. I didn&#039;t care for his character. He is overreacting.<br />
<br />
Noel Vermillion is your typical damsel in distress and not to mention she always cry easily when things go wrong. Even when she is crying &quot;Baka&quot;, she didn&#039;t put into any emotion.<br />
<br />
Taokaka&#039;s personality reminds me of Neko Arc. Not to mention Jubei&#039;s personality reminds me of Neko Arc Chaos. Neko Arcs are the characters from Carnival Phantasm who are hosts for the show. Taokaka is cheerful while Jubei is serious. Except that Taokaka is more annoying than compared to the Neko Arc.<br />
<br />
Jubei was an interesting character but he didn&#039;t have enough screen time or anything to work with.<br />
<br />
Hazama&#039;s personality reminds me of Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter. However, Hisoka is more threatening than compared to Hazama.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast were all like emo and never show signs of happiness. Especially Rachel Alucard &amp; Kokonoe. <br />
<br />
The only character I rooted for was Lambda-11. However, her character was thrown out of the anime in the later episodes. Thank you for doing that.<br />
<br />
There was no character development.<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION (2):<br />
<br />
This anime tried to compress into 13 episode but failed to make the story progress properly. There are some scene that jump from one scene to another without explaining. And we have the ending that was anti-climactic, some characters just become enemies for no reason. Just like one minute they liked one another and the next time was like &quot;You&#039;re a terrible person&quot;. <br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t expecting much from this anime since people already gave it a low rating. The story and characters are handled poorly. But there are at least some decent action scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall, Blazblue Alter Memory is just a mindless action game adaptation that was poorly adapted. I didn&#039;t expect anything good from this anime. i just wanted to examine on what made this anime a poor game adaptation.<br />
<br />
I am not hard on this anime just because I like good video games. I am hard on this anime because I like good anime. Unfortunately, BlazBlue Alter Memory didn&#039;t do that.<br />
<br />
And so I give this anime a 2 out of 10. If you want a better experience, play the Blazblue games. If you want to watch this anime, watch it with a group of friends and rip on this anime. It will definitely be an enjoyable time.<br />

    Story - I think it would be better if they had more fighting scenes , but instead its more like flashbacks that are really close or identical to the game so might as well play the game for more plot. <br />
<br />
Art - i enjoyed the art i liked it a lot compared to some other animes i&#039;ve seen that have random budget cuts and art turns terrible , overall it was enjoyable for the scenes/arts<br />
<br />
Sound - good quality depending where the person is watching from.<br />
<br />
Character - Characters were great , i think they tried to make a little bit to much on ecchi at some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125697">
        points but they were comical so i don&#039;t really know if it was really fitting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - i enjoyed it a lot because i&#039;m a fan of blazblue so i will strongly stand by it , played the games since it first came out.<br />
<br />
Overall - Typical anime fighting / romance ( Tiny parts ) / Interesting i wanna see if they decide to make a season 2 because it does leave on a possible continuable story line.

    BlazBlue: Alter Memory is a standalone anime storyline that is inspired by the BlazBlue videogame series which are all pure masterpieces, more specific the first 2 titles which are BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger and BlazBlue: Continuum Shift. Although it adapts events from the games it adds unique aspects and follows its own direction as an anime which is a good thing because an important aspect of BlazBlue is the different fates that can be crossed. The artwork and character designs of BlazBlue have always been extremely beautiful and the anime gives them justice, especially Taokaka is one of the best anime characters of all time and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288872">
        one of my personal favorites. The overall setting and the battles that happen followed by the amazing music are very enjoyable. The true soul of the BlazBlue series however lies within the games and all of them are defiiately worth experiencing BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger, BlazBlue: Continuum Shift, BlazBlue: Chronophantasma, the best game in the series BlazBlue: Centralfiction and the newest entry BlazBlue: Cross Tag Batle which expands the universe with Persona, Under Night in Birth &amp; RWBY.

    After complate BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger Story mode, this anime was my most desired adaptation but result was total disappointment for me. I did fascinated from games story, maybe because of that i couldnt watch it objectivly. <br />
<br />
First of all story telling was horribly boring. I couldnt watch even after episode 6. I accept it BlazBlue have diffrent story modes for every character plus true ending story mode. Because of that tide up whole story is very hard thing but my expectation was episode story arcs for every story mode whatching same story from diffrent characters eye.<br />
<br />
If you are played game, finished whole story mode (not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230969">
        arcade mode stories in that total diffrent case) and if you really like it, i dont believe you are really enjoy this anime.

    This thing sucks. It trys way too hard to faithfully turn the games into an anime but just ends up with typical, generic characters with little to no development. The music was sub-par and the anime was painfully boring, with a completely confusing story which I ended up paying no attention to and just playing on my other monitor. It&#039;s just a completely terrible anime.<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t much else to say (but MAL forces me to write more) so I&#039;ll just point out the logo for this series is completely awesome. The art&#039;s pretty good too. <br />
<br />
Jin is also the only good character but he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202982">
        doesn&#039;t even move the Character section up to a 2 because he&#039;s absolutely overshadowed by the other cruddy characters.<br />
<br />
<br />

    As far as anime adaptations for games go, this one isn&#039;t the greatest, yet at the same time it is inoffensive to its source material.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The story of Alter Memory is to the Blazblue franchise what a recap episode is to a season of any other anime: more enjoyable if you&#039;ve gone through the original airing/game. Alter Memory focuses mainly on the key story elements from Blazblue Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift, and glosses over many of the other plot lines from those games.<br />
Art: 7<br />
The art really varies between scenes, for some, it is quite fluid, and for others, it&#039;s a little odd (Looking at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207007">
        you, Jin&#039;s Ice Brick), but it&#039;s not jarring enough that the viewer will be turned off.<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Considering this is an anime based on a fighting game, the only way its sound track can go is up, and Alter Memory delivers, not to mention one of the first tracks played is Ragna&#039;s theme &#039;Rebellion&#039;.<br />
Characters: 5<br />
This is the part that usually makes or breaks this adaptation, considering most of the characters get glossed over for Ragna, Jin and Noel, but when the characters do appear, they at least remain true to who they are.<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
As someone whom has played through the story of both games, I found this to be an enjoyable treat as a fan.<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I&#039;d only really recommend this if you&#039;ve played Blazblue before, as you&#039;d get more enjoyment out of it then.

    Hello World, my Third Review is here! With the power of the Azure...<br />
<br />
Well, as a fan of the Blazblue series I was excited to see sometime an anime adaptation. Well, I was a bit TOO hyped for that, and failed miserabily.<br />
<br />
Story: The story was MEH, only Ragna, Jin, Noel and the true end stories got the major spotlight, I feel utterly disappointed for this, because it not fleshed out the other funny characters such as Bang and Tao, and badly resumed, it was so rushed. I&#039;ll put a little 1 for tiresome story. Because of the beach episode too, it didn&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
Art: Meh, one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197691">
        of the worst parts, the biggest offenders were Hazama and others. They got out of character really fast... 3 points. The games got better animation than this. The fight scenes were also is pretty awful.<br />
<br />
Sound: Not the badass score of the games, but at least they try to be epic and nice sounding too. Like the Opening and Ending songs, but also some of the instrumental songs as Nu&#039;s theme. A 5 just for mercy.<br />
<br />
Character: Since the story is rushed, the protagonists got major attentions, but at least the others got some moments, such as Noel&#039;s friends, Hakumen, Rachel and even Kokonoe for example, and other aren&#039;t fleshed out enough, like in the games. A 3.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I didn&#039;t enjoyed this, and personally, the beach episode I skipped it, and I was struggling to continue it, I made it amost all the episodes. A 2 for wasting.<br />
<br />
Aaand. I don&#039;t recommend it because It not fleshes out many of the good aspects. Play the games instead, these are more fun and more coherent. See ya.<br />
<br />
Overall a nice 2/10~

    A video game adaptation and you don&#039;t get whats going on..? No.... Never....<br />
<br />
If you are trying to pick this series up and u haven&#039;t played through story mode COMPLETELY in BBCT or BBCSEX you will have no chance of understanding everything that is happening in this series.<br />
<br />
This animeseems to be made for fans of the game alone, and even there they don&#039;t quite hit the mark of epicness the game brings about. Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this series to anyone unfamiliar with BlazBlue, as this anime is based on the sequel to the first game.<br />
<br />
This series involves manymanymanymanymany time loops and world lines. Many of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142509">
        which from the game aren&#039;t included at all. And only a few characters are truly aware of what is going on, if you aren&#039;t familiar with the series you will be lost. They don&#039;t have time in a 12 episodeseason to explain the nuances between the characters, and the history of the game, and actually have things happen as well.<br />
<br />
The fights are decent (though some characters end up looking really bad at fighting), the music is taken from the BGMs in the game (which is an awesome touch for fans), and the animation is pretty good as well. Finally seeing the events that transpire in game put into animation just makes me love the characters even more. Thank you ArcSys for taking the risk of making this show!<br />
<br />
Great series if you&#039;ve played the game.
