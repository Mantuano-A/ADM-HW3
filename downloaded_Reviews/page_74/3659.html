    Witch Craft Works! An anime about witches and stuff. An average anime with cliché characters and not much of a plot. Even though I say that, it was still an enjoyable watch. With outstanding animation and the great OST, WCW was a nice 12-ep anime which was pretty funny with it&#039;s catchy ending song.<br />
<br />
Story. 7<br />
<br />
The story is about a normal boy, going to school as always, but then one day the schools most popular girl starts to interact with him. After getting to know her, he learns of her identity as a witch. She tells him about the special &quot;being&quot; inside of him and starts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136777">
        to protect him from danger. <br />
The story is pretty simple in the beginning, but after a while it gets a little better but it&#039;s not anything special. There are pretty cool fights sometimes but they don&#039;t really go in dept with the story, so don&#039;t expect anything extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Art. 9.5<br />
<br />
The animation is just outstanding as I mentioned before. Well, the characters might look a little weird but the background and all the details are one of the best I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime. The action scenes are very beatifully drawn while also being epic!<br />
<br />
Sound. 9<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really good, for real. I like the opening but the ending is just addictive, it&#039;s a very catchy song with a bit disturbing video, but it&#039;s cute! The voice acting can be a little annoying sometimes but it fits, it gives more of a comedical feeling to it.<br />
<br />
Character. 6.3<br />
<br />
Well, there some characters that were pretty cool but were not any of the main characters. Most of the characters are the archetypes and the main character is preeeettyy annoying, but if you&#039;re able to see trough that, you&#039;ll probably enjoy this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. 7.8<br />
<br />
It was an enjoyable anime for me and I do not regret watching it, it was very fun at times and the visuals and the BGM was very pleasant. However, it still has a lot of flaws and it isn&#039;t a masterpiece. If you are to watch this anime, don&#039;t have too high expectations, just think of it as a light hearted anime. <br />
<br />
Overall. 7.8<br />
<br />
It was definitely worth the watch, but I&#039;m not too fond of these sub-harem animes. The ending was satisfactory but nothing special. The comedy part of this anime can be pretty fun and despite the main characters personality and the lack of plot, the other things makes up for it and it becomes a pleasant enough anime. <br />
<br />
SORRY FOR THE BAD ENGLISH. <br />
<br />
<br />

    An anime where the villains are more entertaining to watch than the main cast, Witch Craft Works takes pages from Pokemon and does it better than Team Rocket.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
In a world with two warring witch guilds, the Workshop Witches and the more evil Tower Witches, our main hero is to be protected by a very strong Workshop Witch.  The typical story of a powerless protagonist to become a strong hero is overdone and things that happen throughout this story are standard to the plot of a rising hero.  There are parts where I was confused on contracts and such, but this comes more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136887">
        from my dislike of reading contracts and how a contract could contradict another contract or how establishing a contract can make one null and void.  Reasons why I never will be a lawyer.  <br />
<br />
Though I have said that the plot is of a typical rising hero, this common story help set a pacing that was perfect.  The rising hero storyline follows a rollercoaster of pacing, where it starts off slow and precedes to pick up as the main character learns new skills and eventually takes on the main antagonist.  One reason why this type of storyline is slow at the start is because of the pure focus on the main character, going from a weakling to a stronger hero, the pacing reflects that.  Witch Craft Works throws a wrench into that focus on the main hero as his teacher who is strong from the start helps with battles and fighting.  There are training scenes combined with scenes involving the teacher fighting that create a smooth pacing throughout the series.     <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art in this anime was either super amazing or just super choppy.  Amazing parts include the animation of art and flying, the character designs as well as the designs for the minions and all the details put into the city.  Some choppy parts included a choppy 3D animation at the end, some fighting scenes, especially between minions, looked awkward as well as some explosions appeared to have missing frames.  The proportions for Kagari looks weird as well.. I mean anime with big-boobed characters look normal compared to Kagari... There is somethign about the way she is drawn that doesn&#039;t look quite right.<br />
<br />
The best thing about the art was the use of color.  Monochrome art is something that isn&#039;t seen too often but Witch Craft Works uses it exceedingly well.  Certain scenes just blew me away with all the hues and shades used of a color.  <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The OP, &quot;divine intervention&quot; was a decent OP that reflected the fantasy aspect of a mages world.  The way it did this was through playing &quot;happy&quot; notes on a synthpad.  The combination of happiness and a synth helps give the idea that this is an anime that isn&#039;t a dark witch anime, but rather a bright sided one.  The ED is by far my favorite thing of this anime.  Witch Activity is super catchy, fast-paced song that sums up everything that the these villains are, evil, but not truly evil. The ED itself awarded this score of a 9, it&#039;s just something about the song that makes me play it on replay.<br />
<br />
The background music was lacking.  It did not ave enough impact for it to be memorable and never really helped carry a mood.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
The characters that made this anime were the 5 Tower Witches you get introduced to in the first and second episode.  They are very similar to the Team Rocket trio in where they appear villainous only to become comedic jokes throughout the series.  The only difference is that there Tower Witches are more entertaining to watch than the Rocket trio.  The Witches are serious at parts so they have to be taken seriously at times, unlike the Rocket trio where they aren&#039;t taken seriously after episode 1.  <br />
<br />
Character development... was lacking for the main characters.  The main character didn&#039;t really develop a new way of thinking but rather just gained information about the new world while Kagari didn&#039;t develop much besides giving more freedom to Takamiya.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
With a story that is quite generic, I was surprised that I enjoyed this anime.  Most of my enjoyment came from scenes involving the Tower Witches but the main characters were also quite interesting to watch.  <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Witch Craft Works was an anime that surprised me as I thought it would be quite a dark show.  I was assuming that it would involve mages killing mages constantly trying to protect the important things.  Though this is right, it was nowhere near as dark as I imagined it and I was glad to give this anime a shot.

    Recently, magical school anime seem to be very popular. Witch Craft Works is not much different, except it has magicians attending school alongside non-magical people. Our main protagonist, Takamiya, at first doesn&#039;t know about any of this. He just keeps to himself and avoids getting involved with people until the most popular girl, Kagari also known as Hime (princess), forcefully gets involved in his high school life. It turns out that Takamiya actually has vast magical potential hidden inside of him that evil witches want and would kill him to obtain, so Kagari (who is a witch) must protect him. And she does an excellent

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136753">
        job of protecting him considering she&#039;s an extremely overpowered magician with fire magic that can instantly obliterate half a city. Too bad her personality isn&#039;t as interesting as her magic, but oh well, it&#039;s still fun to watch her destroy stuff emotionlessly.<br />
<br />
The story in Witch Craft Works jumps around a lot. Each episode is very fast paced and the story is always moving in one way or another (whether it has any effect on the plot or not). This results in certain parts of the story being very entertaining, while others are just annoying and bizarre.<br />
<br />
The thing I dislike most about this series, though, is the first episode. I thought this series was going to be absolutely terrible after I watched it. It takes every high school anime cliche (popular girl, guy getting beaten up for being around her, transfer students, etc) to the annoying extreme. The bullying part was especially stupid (and why is one bully named Obama?) because it was portrayed in a humorous way, but it just made you feel bad for Takamiya. However, after the first episode, most of these aspects are forgotten and don&#039;t affect the story at all, so it&#039;s not too much of a problem overall.<br />
<br />
The character cast is a little too large for it&#039;s own good and tends to introduce unimportant characters as if they will be important. Takamiya and Kagari are really the only characters given proper introductions. These two are decent protagonists, but they don&#039;t bring anything new to plate. Kagari I found to be very boring both in every aspect aside from her overpowered magic abilities, and Takamiya is a generic protagonist who doesn&#039;t want anyone to get hurt. It also does a poor job of introducing some of the more important villains. The five initial comedic relief villains are just there for the hell of it since they do nothing except be funny and be in the ED. Another villain, Medusa (I&#039;m sure you can easily guess what her powers are), is also just kind of there and doesn&#039;t do anything except make Takamiya develop more. Takamiya&#039;s younger sister who fights over him with Kagari is the only other memorable character. The rest are mostly unimportant or are introduced towards the end.<br />
<br />
The animation for this anime is actually it&#039;s best aspect. The action and aerial scenes are stunning and the CG really isn&#039;t too bad, and at times it&#039;s meant to look funny anyway. The character designs aren&#039;t the best, and I didn&#039;t care for Kagari&#039;s design, but they&#039;re certainly not bad. Some of the more magical scenes also look splendid with vivid colors and crazy designs. And the magic itself looks great, especially Kagari&#039;s overpowered fire magic. If you like fire a lot, you&#039;ll at least like one part of this show. The music is good with an excellent OP and a strange yet catchy ED. The soundtrack during the action sequences fits them very well but other than that not much stands out.<br />
<br />
Witch Craft Works is pretty average in my opinion. It looks great, but some of the story is just random and strange and the characters needed more time to develop with a smaller cast of actually relevant characters. Too many characters are introduced quickly late in the show and too many are introduced for too long in the beginning only to fade out of importance by the end. The final villain was especially terribly introduced, and the show made it seem like the villain was just a precursor villain for the real one except that that wasn&#039;t the case. Takamiya&#039;s power could have also used a better explanation, but I&#039;m not sure even he knows exactly what his power is either. But even with all those problems, it&#039;s not a bad show and it was fairly entertaining.

    Magic exists. Maybe it doesn’t in real life but it’s a phenomenal power of curiosity that exists in the world of Witch Craft Works. It’s not natural because people can’t just be born with it. However, it is like an essence that becomes infused with the show itself. For our normal male protagonist, Takamiya Honoka, his typical life will never be the same again after coming head to head with magic. <br />
<br />
As a series based on fantasy with supernatural elements, expect several attributes that defines this anime: magic, witchcraft, and competence. Well to be perfectly honest, Witch Craft Works shouldn’t be judged by its merits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136829">
        of premise. There’s nothing distinctive about it. We have the normal boy, Takamiya Honoka who meets the idol (queen or princess as referred by others) at school known to many as Kagari Ayaka. Their meeting isn’t very normal with the circumstances after she reveals herself as a witch. It’s a trite formula used over and over in series similar to this. <br />
<br />
Witch Craft Works doesn’t escape a sea of cliches in any way. Rather, it classically defines it with its dull protagonist, Takamiya. There’s literally nothing special about the boy as many characters throughout the series sees him as the ‘average Joe’. On the other hand, we have a queen at school named Kagari Ayaka that serves as Takamiya’s antithesis. Almost everyone at school literally worships and tries to get on her good side. The show emphasizes the idea that she is their Goddesses while Takamiya is viewed as nothing more than a sidekick, or even a servant. Some may even think Takamiya blackmailed their ‘queen’ into being his friend/accomplice. And in essence, their relationship is monotonous. It isn’t just defined by their interactions or cheesy dialogues but rather by their lack of connection. There’s almost nothing compatible between the duo whether it’d be their traits, abilities, or status. More than anything, we only know that Kagari wishes to protect him with her life. Throughout the series, it does spark some curiosity as to what this may be. Otherwise, their relationship is about stone cold as a boulder lacking any features of enthrallment.<br />
<br />
In essence, Takamiya’s life now gets entangled with witches, magecraft, and a whole hoard of envious student unions. The story seems to focus on his life and what changes now from where it stands. On the surface, his life can be defined as a being in jeopardy now. This is because there’s a secret that lies within Takamiya that makes other witches want to hunt him down. Think of it as a ‘treasure hunt’. Takamiya is the treasure while the witches are the hunters. While it does focus on a cat-and-mouse style of formula on occasions, the hype quickly dies out. Most of the characters, or rather witches can hardly make an effort against Takamiya thanks to the presence of Kagari. It isn’t the fact that the witches are weak but rather Kagari who is abnormally strong. With a witch’s hat, armed with her magic wand, and fiery attitude, there’s almost nothing that can stop her from achieving her goal. Perhaps there is something that can stop her: Takamiya himself. If either of the duo are separated, it becomes a become problem for the duo as Takamiya would be unable to protect himself properly. This is where the clichés comes in involving other characters trying to separate the duo. When that happens, we get a black comedy level of violence. Surprisingly, it does feel serious with the mood characterized by the action. On the other hand, the results are often predictable because of various circumstances. What you likely expect is what you will get: the typical paradox of friendship conquers all.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the show isn’t necessarily colored entirely by friendship per se. Although the duo isn’t very compatible, there’s some romanticism going on. It’s not easy to notice in this series because the two main characters contrasts too much from each other. Because Kagari is often the one saving Takamiya, it’s also easy to notice that she is the senior of their relationship. Not only that but she holds authority at school and has a commanding presence. The good news is that the show doesn’t depict them as a master/slave relationship. The bad news is that their relationship lacks connection. It doesn’t characterizes itself as anything as sui generis. It’s quite obvious to see how much Kagari dedicates herself to protect Takamiya beyond her line of duty. Whether her attraction towards the young boy is romantic or not remains anonymous because they don’t connect in a way a normal couple should be. Furthermore, the series falls with the classic imouto, or otherwise ‘little sister’ trope involving Takamiya’s sister. It won’t take long for you to figure out that she holds some peculiar affections towards her brother. While it doesn’t necessarily go into an incestuous route, Takamiya’s sister resorts to violence to get what she wants. It defiles what an average family relationship should be while lengthening the gap between the siblings. <br />
<br />
Magic is prominent theme in the show because it defines the essence that the witches use throughout each episode. There’s no official class or order that gives ranks to any of the witches. Some of the witches are categorized by types. Yet most often, Kagari just takes the stage and presents the testament of her powers. This brings a problem involving the other witches with their characterization. Only a few of them gets moments to shine with back stories with the most obvious being Kagari. That aside, the action the witches perform throughout the show does offer some memorable moments. Spells are thrown in the air with passion and often envelops a fight with its mystical aura. The fantasy element is credible with the bizarre bunny knights, transformations, and even artistic bomb explosives. The premise also takes itself seriously with actual magical content and emphasis on Takamiya’s development in magical arts. Finally, Kagari can pull out some terrific performances from her hat thanks to her talent.<br />
<br />
Taken for granted, Witch Craft Works has the artistic style of a generic series. Takamiya looks normal, perhaps too normal to be defined as a distinctive character. There’s literally nothing that stands out about him in physical characteristics. Kagari is the one that stands out the most with her witches hat, outfit, and attitude. Thankfully, the witches can also be distinctive judged by their physical standards. Most of them are decorated with flamboyant outfits that actually make them look like witches. Even the creatures they summon can be fun to get used to by their nature. J.C. Staff handles the series’ production and plays out its theme correctly. However, there are some moments where the artistic style can be unfitting. In particular, there are usage of computer generated graphics during flight scenes of the backgrounds (i.e. buildings, cars, etc). <br />
<br />
Music and soundtrack is noticeable throughout the series. There’s a magical tone of its OST during scenes when mechanics of witchcraft is explained, most noticeably by Kagari. Soundtrack during action scenes is also consistent on most parts. Spells are also chanted that offers credibility of its themes with words that seems fitting. However, Takamiya once again becomes a problem that holds the characters’ cast back. His voice stands out as dull and annoying. His role throughout the series makes it hard to endure for his lazy attitude and distressing responses. Otherwise, music plays the more fun element of this show in particular with its comedic ED song. It transforms the idea of torture into a parody based on its sensational lyrics. The OST also has a mystical aura behind its tone that may draw you in to the show.<br />
<br />
An attempt to enjoy Witch Craft Works will be difficult if you dislike the main male protagonist, Takamiya. Even many characters in the series dislikes him for his normalcy and dullness. Also, expect the expected as most of the story will feel like a predictable trifle of what you may be used to for its generics. Do not expect major plot twists or deep characterization. Rather, just take for what is granted – a magical story between a normal boy and an abnormal with. Emphasis on the abnormal. <br />

Bueno, this anime has just ended, so how do I find it, well, I just gonna present my ratings without anymore BS, so, here are my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category:<br />
<br />
Good 7: Story and Sound.<br />
<br />
Story:  I gave the story such rating co&#039;z at one point I admire the girl protecting guy from harm kind of thing, I guess this is one anime where the girls have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136775">
        the balls while the guys.......or guy were in skirts, however unlike other animes with such theme, this one has the girl falling in love with the guy and not treating him like shit and the girl itself wasn&#039;t treated like a nuisance. However, it&#039;s plot, thought it was suppose to be something that was exaggerated was turned into like rocket science where one could find it difficult as to the circumstances as to how the girl was linked to the boy and how the contract thingy works with the girl&#039;s madre who has the task of protecting the city. Also, there are a lot of conflicting situation as to distinguishing the difference between the antagonist and the protagonist even though this anime was meant to focus on the relationship between the girl and the boy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: Ok, for the most part, I kinda like most of the voice actors who portrayed the character&#039;s in this anime, but the one who did Chronoire&#039;s voice, well I think it doesn&#039;t fit her given that in this anime she is a hundred something years old witch, where in my opinion she should have been given a more matured voice. Also, I don&#039;t like the opening song, but I do like the closing, WITCH, WITCH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent 4: <br />
<br />
Art: For the most part, everything was just too fancy, except the school uniform that them girls were wearing since I like its simplicity, but I got to hand it, this anime has no fanservice for the doggies to how about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very Good 8:<br />
<br />
Character: Here, I admire Kagari for being this head strong girl who&#039;d be willing to go to any extent to keep Honoka from harm, I also like the way that she acts as a mother figure to the guy, despite of the fact that she is suppose to be the guy&#039;s love interest.<br />
<br />
Honoka on one hand.......hummm, I do find him annoying at times, but I like the part that he has such integrity of not wanting to depend on Kagari and would rather see her safe that having to go to such effort of protecting him.<br />
<br />
As for the Ivory Quintet, well they do provide the comedy aspect of this anime and so as the guy&#039;s sister.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fair 6:<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: It was enjoyable, but understanding as to what is what and who is who about this anime makes look like rocket science even though this anime&#039;s genre was romance, magic, supernatural and action.<br />
<br />
Overall: It wasn&#039;t that bad, however, as to how&#039;s and what&#039;s in this anime basically lacks a more simplistic explanations, but still it&#039;s ok to such extent and I&#039;m not saying anything anymore. Adios chicos y chicas.   <br />

I&#039;ll get to the point.  The main character is one of the most pathetic, sniveling, whiny, weak, pieces of crap i have bore witness to.  Not once does he man up, and the only time he does something actually somewhat noble, he&#039;s crying throughout.  For example, one character is dying, all he has to do is kiss the character to ressurect the character.  He decided to snivel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156143">
        and cry and whine for about 5 minutes.  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a point at which the pathetic-ness of a character reaches a point that you stop caring, usually i would have turned it off except I felt a payoff was due, i sat through over half of it, i was going to see it through, so why didn&#039;t i turn it off.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a certain plot device in anime, movies, tv, that is meant to build the suspense and anxiety, this particular device makes me rage.  In WCW, it reached such an absurd point that my soul actually left my body.  Imagine having super powers, there is an evil villian that comes to your town, destroys everything, tortures your friends, and then kills everyone.  You would think that if you had a slight advantage you would take it and dispose of this person.<br />
<br />
In WCW, the villains come into town, devise evil, the main characters beat them up a little bit and then walk away leaving the villains half beat up.  Ofc they are villains, so naturally they go away and come back.  At what point should you expect the main characters to at least tie them up?  Nothing breaks immersion or even suspension of disbelief more than something so absurdly unbelieveable as letting the villains go.  I understand you might not want to kill them, i mean, they only killed everyone in town and destroyed everything.  Let them go.  The last episode of the trash bag, this probably happened about 10 times. In a row.  To the point where they would beat the villain up, turn around and start chatting to each other, and then the villain would get up right behind their backs and attack them again.  and everytime they did this, the attacks got more and more heinous until the villain actually killed both of them.  Oh, if it wasn&#039;t for love the heroes wouldn&#039;t have ressurected.  alas.<br />
<br />
So after the villain literally stabs the main character in the back, she regrets what she&#039;s done so she uses magic to heal the mc a little bit and then walks right out in front of like 20 of their friends.  And she just walks away and they have no intention of doing anything to her.  Their jails in this show get broken out of by everyone who gets put in them.  Literally, everyone that ever gets put in jail in this show breaks out immediately.  Seriously what is the point?  The villains basically shit all over everyone and they love it.  I mean this is an anime for extreme masochists.  Japan is doing a great job teaching this shit to people.<br />
<br />
How am i supposed to feel about this?  The protagonists were terrible to watch, the most uninteresting piles of crap i&#039;ve ever seen.  The &quot;villains&quot; were the only redeeming factor in this entire show.  AND NOBODY WON ANYTHING.  Nothing was resolved, none of it even made any sense.  All of it was avoidable.  Every single plan that the evil doers plotted was obviously preventable.  The show didn&#039;t hide it, they wanted you to know that.  <br />
<br />
What was the story here?  MC has power, everyone tries to protect that power, everyone fails miserably, and then nothing happens.  I don&#039;t think i&#039;ve ever felt this enraged after a show before.  I hope you didn&#039;t read all of this, but if you did, the moral to this story is stay away unless you can enjoy the fake, lazy suspense that the MC&#039;s create by doing virtually nothing and acting so naive and unreasonable that you have to suspect this entire show was written ad hoc on the back of a bar coaster.<br />
<br />
Good night.

    This is a show which I thought would kind of separate from other mediocre shows with bland characters, bland plot, and uninspired animation. I was kind of right in watching this show.<br />
<br />
Let me first start out with the plot.<br />
<br />
The story is not too bad. really. It&#039;s not, but it&#039;s not a gem either. To summarize... Some bountiful white bitch who refers to him as &quot;himesama&quot; or &quot;princess&quot; must protect him from this group of witches.. who have animal ears.. and stuff. That is pretty much the only distinction between them and the friendly witch group who is supposed to protect the main character.<br />
<br />
stuff happens, main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138245">
        characters gets attacked, and the hime to the himesama saves the day once again. Woopdeedoo! Why should I care? Once again, we are not informed of this strong power inside of this main character person the evil witches are after until the last episode. It doesn&#039;t even enlighten you as to why there are two separate witch factions and why animal-ears faction is targeting the city. Which leaves you wondering &quot;what the fuck is going on right now?&quot; half way through the show. <br />
<br />
Also, just something I&#039;d like to note: Does this anime realize how many buildings were crushed or blown up throughout this series? Enough to warrant a declaration of a terrorist attack. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
If I were to grade art and animation seperately then I&#039;d give art a 9 out of 10. The animation however.. is pretty inconsistent to be frank. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The animation is really good.. in some instances anyway. One scene that comes to mind is at some point in the very first episode. You get to see Kagari (the hime to the himesama or just that one heroine in the show) do some Cuuuurraaaazy spins and flame wheel attacks with her broom. It was really nice, I liked it. It gave me hope for the show. But as the show went on, I noticed how lazy J.C. Staff was being. (JCS also did K-Project or K for short) K is a pretty good anime. Not gonna lie but god damn did they mess up the fight animations. They did these pregenerated attack sequences with some of the main characters and it just didn&#039;t look well at all and not to mention the still frames... Well, I can strongly say that WCW was a step up from that but it definitely varies. <br />
<br />
The monster (Giant rabbits and bears) animation looks GREAT I must say. I found myself really enjoying king kong one-on-one battles between two giant monsters (and its CG btw). It was very fluent and hilarious at times to see these wonderful scenes. However even though they did better with (some of) their fight scenes, the witch battles still varied from great to slightly average to still frames which I guess you could chock of to bad budget. <br />
<br />
The biggest offender of this that I can think of would have to be the second to last episode (without spoiling anything). There is a scene where heroine girl is fighting with the evil villain person-witch gal and it just goes into this 3rd person perspective of heroine gal for no goddly reason and basically she is just dodging all these explosions. It comes off as choppy and amateurish.<br />
<br />
So to summarize, in some aspects as impressed with JCS&#039;s improvements and in others I was pretty disappointed with their slip-ups.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Pretty nice, however there is dat ED... There were so many times I would force myself to watch this brain tumor of a song. Words can not describe how much I despise it (not that&#039;s bad.. but good lord is it bad).<br />
 I&#039;m not much of a musicoholic so can&#039;t say much else here. Hi.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Main character was kind of annoying, heroine was okay. All the sub characters are pretty dumb but some of them are quite interesting (Some). oh, and theres the yandere sister... Yahh. Also did not see any character development, the MC was a wuss through and through to the end. And the heroine was still just an overpowered silent hoe.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
<br />
Despite some flaws in budget, story and character development it was still pretty enjoyable but nothing I&#039;d encourage for others to watch. But if you want to try it out, then go ahead. You won&#039;t be dissapointed but not so much awwed either.<br />
<br />

    Witch Craft Works is honestly a hard anime to review in my opinion. It contains a lot of cliches, standard anime stock characters, and has moments when 3D CGI is used to help stretch the animation budget. The 12 episodes cover a good bit of story but when the ride is over it feels a bit overwhelming as a whole, yet I highly enjoyed WCW. Is it because I expected this to be another run of the mill harem anime and turned out to be a quirky fantasy romance? That I can&#039;t truly say.<br />
<br />
What I can say about WCW is this: it&#039;s fun. While a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137475">
        majority of characters are the usual recycled stock characters, they have enough spice to them to keep them all interesting and they all work extremely well together which is something that a few too many anime fails to work out. The animation excluding the meh CGI moments is incredibly good and one of my personal favorite touches for the anime was how colorful it was just to look at, but a good anime has to have more than a pretty face right?<br />
<br />
I mentioned that the story feels a bit underwhelming, after all while most loose ends are explained they are so quickly brushed aside and conflicts end up so easily resolved it often feels like everything leading up to it was just for flashy show rather than story substance. However at the same time it almost works to its advantage where in its 12 episode run it doesn&#039;t feel like there are any leftovers that would beckon for a second season. Setting out on what it wants to do and finishing by the final time the ED rings out is something a lot of one cour anime have trouble with.<br />
<br />
Overall, I have to say personally this was the surprise of the winter season for me. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and found myself really loving all the characters in it and having a few good laughs along the way. WCW may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something familiar but different at the same time I would highly recommend WCW.

    Guilty pleasure - is an oxymoron to me. I’ve just learned to take the bad with the good. While a show on one hand can be one of the most intrinsically esoteric works Japan has put out in a decade, that doesn’t stop me from being aware that at times it becomes a narrative cluster brimming with melodrama. Meanwhile, I’m sure we all know a few certain films and series in this medium that are tearjerkers but when broken down logistically aren’t exactly that great. I think that we should love biases and embrace them, it’s what makes us individuals. This notion in my experience

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338785">
        on this site does not really exist.<br />
<br />
People slammed for liking or disliking something by those who feel differently with blind passion, death threats, just look at some comment sections of people who have disfavorable opinions yourself, folks. Most people will avoid these debates to preserve order out of fear, figuring out that that show you held up as a masterpiece or garbage may not be pinnacle of the industry and the worst of it respectively can lead some immature folks to a mental breakdown, but if we ignore our biases long enough to preserve this order, positions become cemented and people would rather kill each other than admit a flaw in their thinking.<br />
<br />
You’re probably wondering what any of this has to do with Witch Craft Works… well, that’s the reason you’re reading this review. O.o Witch Craft Works is for the first time in years, a show I’m confused about. A show I watched while airing and forgot about, but found myself enjoying it like sugar, a cheap treat but a treat nonetheless. Then came back a few years later and watched again. Still didn’t know what to think about it. And now, we’re both here, Dear Reader, because to this day - I’m still not aware. My best guess to figuring out my true opinion towards this show is to write it down, and you’re along for the ride - no false altruism here my friend, this is as much for you as it is for me. I don’t admit that? I’m a hypocrite. Let’s dive.<br />
<br />
<br />
The premise of Witch Craft Works itself isn’t as much as unique as it is simply an inversion of, or in many respects, an embracing of a common story we’ve seen again and again. Main plot revolves a highschooler named Takamiya, Honoka who lives life aloof at best, tortured at worst, this torture coming from resident popular girl in school; Kagari, Ayaka, who has legions of fangirls that crowd the very bus she walks on and, guess if this is literal or not - kiss the ground treads over.. Wondering if this little Divine Comedy will last for the rest of his time in highschool, he’s soon attacked by automatons out of nowhere during the day, this event leads to him discovering the person he despised was a fire witch from a group known as the: “Workshop.” Why is this all happening? Easy; the boy has a power in him locked-and-keyed away that can basically pull a joker-card on these what is revealed to be multiple factions of witches at war. Sounds pretty awesome? Well don’t get your hopes us.<br />
<br />
As cliche but cool of a premise this sounds, it will never go above and beyond any expectation you set for it and is content with the bare minimum, no more relevant and shown than in the main cast. Honoka is the typical damsel figure that must in some way shape or form be saved in every episode, while Kagari, being a tad more enjoyable, is a stoic type with a few kickass one-liners and a strong intimidation factor about her. While these two do indeed have chemistry together, I almost beg to differ with my own statement because in reality, it’s no more impressive than putting two random people on an island together and forcing them to cooperate, it’s less chemistry and more necessity. No matter how close these two get on screen, it never feels too real, like they’re still miles apart. Now whether this is a good or a bad thing or was intended narrative-wise I’m not sure myself, nevertheless, I can’t exactly call their relationship good, bad, but just enjoyable to watch for some odd reason not even I can pin down.<br />
<br />
What I can tell you is that the supporting cast, and everything about the show is far more lovely and inventive, in truth, I’d much rather see a show about our mini-antagonist, those being the enemy faction’s witch goons than anything Honoka and Kagari put out. Filled with quirks, cool cannon fodder in the form of robot… bunnies? It’s going to put a smile on your face sometime eventually no matter how hard you resist. Adding to that, some gags are pretty funny, hell, the ending theme are witches humorously being TORTURED ALIVE in chibi form. <br />
<br />
While I can say I was interested in where the main characters were going and how the plot would play out, especially in the last four episodes, I never for a second was interested in who they “really were”, as people and not charactactures with a slight gender-bending-twist.<br />
<br />
Despite having a bland cast the show finds a fairly symbiotic way to balance its compelling and beautifully animated as well as choreographed  action with this humor, very seldom did a joke fail to entertain me or make me giggle. Not even that, but the OST is designed to make you giddy as well, from the show’s opening: “Divine Intervention”, to some of the main themes by - . . . a composer that interestingly is not able to be found or pinned down. Don’t get me wrong, there is a sound director but there is no link I’ve been able to find to a composer. Huh, witchcraft indeed. Well, whoever this phantom-artist was they never ceased at doing an amazing jab enthralling me into the world. A few harmonic fairy-tale-arias here, to bombastic Final-Fantasy-esque orchestras when some challenging battles happen. I simply cannot agree when some have mentioned the OST to be lacking “impact” or memorability, it’s just attached to a show that is not memorable.<br />
<br />
And you caught my opinion on the show in that last line. Witch Craft Works is cute, charming, hilarious, entertaining, but it’s not concerned about what makes a show get everything right, something to remember it by - a great plot and cast. Nothing is truly accomplished by the end of its run and it’s as if the show just resets, almost feeling as if the adventure you just went on was pointless. . . but I still like it. In fact, I personally love and think it’s an accomplishment of 2d and 3d animation on a tv budget. The show itself is stunning. Can I really give it a pass because its plot, writing, and characters are dull and stiff as a board? I mean. . . sure. It’s what I like. Would I be “lying” to anyone reading this because I’m not sure if I can fully recommend it? If you interpret it that way I suppose, but I’m decently confident that despite it being empty by the end of this, you will not lose anything by watching it. It’s certainly a lovely side-venture in between or before tackling a show that you suspect will be amazing.<br />
<br />
I guess I have my answer, and you have yours. Witch Craft Work accomplishes being; a side-chick. Probably why only weirdos like me still remember and enjoy it, those who get trapped in little aesthetics and design along the way can look back on it with fond memories. Witch Craft Works isn’t as bad as it is passive and non-aggressive with the aspects of it that can be seen as bad. As much as I don’t like referencing original source material, I must admit that I am a fan of this show’s manga and my best guess is that the producers, knowing that they had too little a budget and too little chapters to adapt compromised and made the show mediocre with the manga’s best elements - that being its comedy, designs, and, once again, damn good action.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Witch Craft Work? I highly recommend it despite knowing it’s not a great, maybe not even a good show.. But let’s be glad that our world isn’t so black and white and there can be little shades of gray in between the lines. Give it a shot, what do you really have to lose?

    Witch Craft Works (WCW) was something of a dark horse for me. I was neither expecting to watch it, or even think that I would enjoy it once I actually started. Time, as it seems, has proven me wrong in both regards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
<br />
The story to WCW is simple and not very complex, and is by no means the strong suit to this magic-endowed action/comedy. However, it is paced well enough, and crafted well enough to get you drawn in to what might happen next. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
<br />
The artistic part to WCW is easily one of the noticeably better parts to this anime, with well-designed backgrounds, character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136965">
        designs, effects and 3D animated inserts that don&#039;t look like a kitten thrown in a lion&#039;s den. Most of the backgrounds are strikingly beautiful, while others are rather plain, but all of the art fits well and has a great color palate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound design, music and voice acting is another good point to this show. WCW puts its interesting OST to good use, and manages to accompany its scenes well without standing out too much. The voice acting I think could use some work with some of the minor characters, but overall the cast did a good performance, fitting in with the style of their characters fairly well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to the characters. I really like the centric characters to this story, and while a few of them might not be very unique, I find them endearing. Expect for one, that is. My main beef with this show&#039;s character lists is how they handled the main character. For the most part, Takamiya felt like he was just a tool to advance the story, and there weren&#039;t very many times were I felt like he was actually doing something, which is rather disappointing considering he is the &#039;main&#039; character. Alternatively, Kagari was a very good character. Serious to the point of being funny, she represents, in my mind, the core feeling of WCW and why I found it so enjoyable. Another favorite character of mine is Weekend, who is a good example of a weak-but-dangerous villain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall &amp; Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many elements that WCW does plenty well: Art, Sound and Characters are done better than the rest, if I say so myself. Fantastic backdrops and some good-quality artworks accents the odd and not very serious tone that the story creates, with sound adding on to the oddity that is Witch Craft Works. Overall, I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable show. Serious humor (one of my favorite kinds) and the enjoyable ridiculousness of this show is something that I definitely ask of you to try.

    when your school number 1 beauty comes and sits next to you, saves you and tells you she`s a witch! what would any reasonable person do at that moment... denial<br />
<br />
story:<br />
Now i believe this story has its great points and its flaws. For one i believe a lot of cliché situation were used on this serie as a method of comedy relief. Don`t get me wrong i really enjoyed the occasional joke and i laughed at this serie plenty of times myself, however i believe some of them were a little to obvious.<br />
The plot of this serie however I loved. I like how it was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137107">
        typical story (guy appears normal but has a secret power) but with a twist,putting focus not only to the main character but the situation around him, the witches.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
The art in this serie was pretty good, simple but efficient not to mention that there were plenty of bright colours,well flowing action scenes and sceneries that were very enticing. I believe it lived up well to the standard of modern anime.<br />
<br />
sound:<br />
I love the opening to this serie, its fun, catchy and i think it matches the theme of this anime serie perfectly. The ending was just as good and i love how each witch sang their own part.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I find it really hard to judge the characters to this serie because on one side they are quite typical but at the same time their not. I feel like although quite a few clichés were used i do believe they were used with a twist, a way to make they slightly different from the rest. for example Kagari Ayaka I loved her SO much i thought she was funny and unpredictable, however in the end she just plays the emotionless character... but when it comes to takamiya kun her persona took an unexpected turn that made her so memorable.<br />
I do believe Takamiya kun could have had more of a background considering he was suppose to be the main character.... in the end i think i actually found him the least memorable.<br />
<br />
enjoyment:<br />
I really enjoyed this serie and i really hope there will be a season 2<br />
<br />
overall:<br />
its funny, has a good plot and i would definitely recommend it

    Witch Craft Works (2014)<br />
<br />
STORY: <br />
<br />
A perfectly content guy lives a normal life in a normal way who sits next to the school idol is ignored usually. This is until she becomes talkative to him after his life nearly ends as it turns out she is a witch. The Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches whom both have goals of either peace or careless destruction to gain what they want are after the main protagonist since he is effectively possessed with great power.<br />
The story has many tropes we like to see with this being unusual as the male is more or less helpless with the powerful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314837">
        female cast. <br />
The story plays out with the now sort of couple being attacked and defeating those who wish harm on them. Some fights are easier than others and many accept terms when facing defeat to live somewhat peacefully. <br />
It all reaches a climax in this series which is somehow not categorised as a comedy when it is funny and random at times. Seeing a Churchill tank just sat in the school as people go about their business for example. This is not a Girls und Panzer spin off.<br />
<br />
ART: <br />
<br />
The art style used is very good when down on the ground. When going for large scale conflict that involves giant teddies or whatever battling the quality of the surrounding does drop to almost cut and paste buildings. This however is absolute fine as it stops the eyes from looking away from where they should be. <br />
The characters are all very well done with a lot of cute girls in clear style of tropes. Even if it is odd to see girls with real cat ears on their heads but also human ears, it is nevertheless very cute. <br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
 <br />
The OP is pretty standard of the industry for a generic opening sequence which admittedly has some drops of quality. The ED however is a very fun style to hear especially when combined with the animation of the girls of the KMM gang in a torture like scenario. <br />
The general sound used throughout is fitting and well balanced with the music being played. <br />
The voices of the characters are well chosen. (I watched in Japanese with English subtitles). When a girl who looks like she should have a cute voice does have one it is nice to see. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: <br />
<br />
Our main two protagonists Kagari, Ayaka and Takamiya, Honoka are nicely done through the series with plenty of development. Where in this case Honoka is the weaker male he is some what innocent in many actions especially with his fear to kiss Ayaka on the lips. <br />
The little sister Takamiya, Kasumi is a very enjoyable Bro-Con to watch, which is made so by how she denies being one even though everyone can see it and her habits of sharing the bed with him and the admission of being his future wife and having three children together. <br />
The KMM gang are a nice addition to getting a good amount of screen time as they bring a lot to the party. They fill various tropes with Kuraishi, Tanpopo being my favourite in that she has a sort of anger about her even though she is just a normal girl at the end of the day.<br />
The rest of the characters are slotted in very well and you can be surprised at times who suddenly turns out to be a witch unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
 <br />
The show is very enjoyable to have watched with many moments of humour. The random placement of things around like mentioned can allow hilarity to ensue. The story also is somewhat serious whilst maintaining in a light-hearted way too. The characters really do make this show for when it is serious it is serious but when it changes it can be sudden and unexpected. <br />
In Episode 12 in the first half is an absolute epic moment made by the music.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
<br />
In the end this is a show that is absolutely worth its score. It is funny, serious, emotional and just fun to watch. I watched it from start to finish in a day because I just could not stop watching. It is sad that it does end, however. The manga is on my list to read because it is supposed to be even better. The OVA separately reviewed is also worth a watch even with a drop-in quality overall that is expected from an OVA however. <br />

    This series is a very different, unique type of series! It didn&#039;t turn into a harem-like series like I originally though it was going to. The story is pretty unique in its own right, but I don&#039;t think it had enough time to develop fully or to its fullest being just 12 eps long. The characters mesh together very well, and there wasn&#039;t that traditional relationship that usually exists between the lead male and female characters within the plot. The animation was pretty superb. Overall, this series was very enjoyable and I hope to see a season 2! If you are looking for something that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137149">
        is fairly unique, and has a story that will draw you in...This should be on your list!

    The art style of the anime is... rather silly. Like seriously, who creates giant pink teddybears with a summoning spell?!<br />
<br />
Anyways the story and the characters are amazing! This anime is exactly what happens when you have a standard shonen/sword&amp;sorcery anime, where you swap genders. To top it off, the boy who always needs the saving is even called Princess!<br />
<br />
It gets very funny and the fights are not bad either. I like how they are deliberately making fun of the &quot;enemy&quot; witches. Remember Team Rocket from Pokemon? Kinda like that. Other than that, the anime should likes to make fun of out little &quot;princess&quot;. In your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181732">
        typical &quot;damsel in distress&quot; story this time the boy is the one who needs the saving all the time.<br />
<br />
Kagura, the other main character, is your hero from your shonen manga, but yet again, gender-bent. She&#039;s strong, decisive and on-the-point. However, she does show her feminine side, often unexpectedly, which is also one of the things the anime relies on when making jokes. E.g. how she likes to pamper her boyfriends, or wear his shirt (which is super small on her because of her breasts by the way).<br />
<br />
The characters also have a normal high-school life though (bet you didn&#039;t expect that!). Kagura is the perfect example every girl should strive to be like on high school. The boy however is basically a nobody, a peasant. When he gets together with Kagura, everyone starts hating him, because &quot;it&#039;s not his place&quot;.

    It`s somewhat rare nowadays that I stumble across an anime that isn`t based on some sort of manga, visual novel, video game, book, etc. Most anime of the late years have taken up this trend of creating an animation for ideas and plots that already exist.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that anything`s wrong with that. Anime, of course, is another way to create a larger fanbase of the original thing or idea the anime was created upon. Some anime are created which crash and burn compared to the original product, while others soar above the sales of what was originally being advertised. There are some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153143">
        anime, or some gems, rather, which are looked over quite quickly, and never become as popular as they should. While these specific gems aren`t perfect, they aren`t incredibly terrible either. Not every gem is the shiniest or prettiest gem out there, but maybe, just maybe, it does have that extra sparkle or gleam which makes it so much better once investigated upon further.<br />
<br />
Witch Craft Works is one of these gems.<br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
Witch Craft Works is about a high school student by the name of Honoka Takamiya, a rather regular character who is just passing by his life as quickly and as slowly as everyone else. The most popular girl in school, with great grades, great athletic ability, and great body, that goes by the name of Ayaka Kagari, is always by or near him, causing him discomfort as her raging fans constantly poke or prod at him, annoying Takamiya to no end. One day, Takamiya becomes the victim of a witch looking to steal his power, and she attacks him with her army of mechanical bunnies. Takamiya nearly succumbs to his death as a school building plummets towards him, but he saved by none other than the Fire Witch, and his pretty classmate, Ayaka Kagari. Takamiya acts as the `damsel in distress`, while Kagari is his `knight in shining armor`. The show is based around Kagari protecting her `princess`, as she calls Takamiya, and fighting other witches that are trying to steal Takamiya`s immense power within him. Together, Kagari is unstoppable because of Takamiya.<br />
<br />
The story itself is pretty original and enjoyable as it unfolds. While there are quite a few plot-holes plaguing the anime, and ideas which are never expanded upon, the regular high school setting with fantastical witches is pretty impressive. It`s not a show that you`ll get serious or dark themes from. It`s carefree, funny, and bright, and stays that way, even when the show gets a bit more intense. The anime usually sets itself up for complex and extensive concepts about the story, but it never takes the chance to grasp upon them. Witch Craft Works is usually much too busy focusing on other things within the anime. <br />
<br />
Speaking of things it focuses on, Witch Craft Works takes pride in its own animation. The show is absolutely gorgeous, whether it be during fight scenes, regular slice-of-life events, or comedic clips, this anime knows how to begin, transition, and end with its animation. The drawings and settings are completely breath-taking, and the designs for almost all of the characters are charmingly over-the-top and fitting with the story itself. Everything is a plethora of color, while not being too annoying or in your face about the color scheme. It`s bright and happy, and the art will most definitely not leave you disappointed.<br />
<br />
Witch Craft Works also takes special consideration in its soundtrack. The music fits very well with the anime itself, but there are only a few which particularly stand alone, and could be listened to on any given day while not watching the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening, in both the animation and the singing, but my favorite was the ending. The ED is so catchy and happy-go-lucky, nestling itself in with the mood of the show almost spot-on. I can almost guarantee that it will be stuck in your head for quite some time.<br />
<br />
While both the animation and sound are superb, the characters are a little worse for wear. While I really adore the gender role reversal of the `princess and her knight`, the trope is what`s really focused on in comparison to the characters. Takamiya is comparatively bland, as most damsels are, and his backstory isn`t actually worked on throughout the course of the anime. Kagari is at somewhat of the same downfall, considering she is just like the quiet and stoic type of character, showing her badassery quite often, but never revealing more than that. Sure, her past is looked upon, but it mostly has to do with Takamiya, and nothing else. I love the dynamic between the two mains, but while the rest of the characters look really cool, there`s nothing special or superb about them.<br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
In the end, I really had to think about whether or not to give this anime a seven or an eight. Personally, I`m a bit biased on gender roles reversed, considering I absolutely love when they are performed and done correctly. Sure, Witch Craft Works did a pretty good job on it, but I know some people aren`t as happy with that sort of dynamic focus in the anime. If I were to compare this show to something, it would be like...... It was mostly like a shonen anime, but with all of the genders switched around. And no. Damn. Harem. (For the most part)<br />
<br />
Overall, while I loved every second of this happy, funny, optimistic show, the story just wasn’t all there. At the end of the day, it was just another anime with great potential that was never expanded upon. Sure, I loved it, but it`s not the best thing I’ve ever seen. If I were to recommend it, which I`m going to, I would say that it`s sort of like a `let`s take a break` anime. Something to watch in between intense anime or really lengthy anime. While I liked it, the only thing I can hope for is a second season, and character development.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 7.5/10

    I first encountered Witch Craft a few years back on a certain manga site. To my delight, last year it had an animation. It’s been my principle to NOT watch on-going shows, so I’m always late on what’s happening. You see, I just don’t like being left with cliff hangers. Anyway, let’s get on with my ever-so-late review.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
With all honesty, I find Witch Craft’s plot very similar with a lot of seinen series out there. And when I mean similar, It’s your average hi-I’m-the-protagonist-who’s-a-normal-student-who-gets-joined-up-with-a-pretty-complicated-situation. Don’t get me wrong, though! It is not a bad thing. I mean, there are no two exact same things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183741">
        in this world, except zubats and dugtrios in a cave. Kidding aside, like I’ve said before, Witch Craft’s plot isn’t that unique.<br />
The show is about witches, (thanks, Captain Obvious!) and Takamiya Honoka our princess—I mean our male MC. Takamiya is your regular high-school student who happens to sit and rides the same bus every single day with the most popular girl in his school Kagari Ayaka. One day, he takes out the trash from their room and disaster strikes our MC! Oh, don’t worry; it’s just a minor problem. It’s just a part of the school building… That’ll fall on his head. Of course, we wouldn’t want to end the show with just one episode and let Takamiya die. By unknown reasons, he was saved by Kagari Ayaka. And everything about his normal life will turn around because of this event. What will happen to Takamiya’s everyday regular life? Find out and watch it yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Like I’ve said with all my previous reviews, we will rarely see unpleasant art these modern days. Back with Witch Craft’s; its art is nothing short of magnificent. Every bit is detailed, from the characters to the cute penguins, cats, rabbits, bears, snakes, which constantly appear background. Witch Craft’s art is respectable, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
Sound or music is a vital part of how good a series can be, too. From the special sound effects to the opening themes and closing themes, everything can be added up to judge how a series would turn to. As for Witch Craft’s, it’s sound effects during fight scenes were fine. What draws my attention was the ending theme done by the antagonist-esque five-women-group made titled, “Witch Activity”. Its upbeat tune made me gaga, and dance like a retard. Forget I said that. Anyway, the OP’s not that bad, either.<br />

I like the way the characters turned out in the animation. When I first read the manga I thought that Kagari Ayaka was a guy. I mean, I wouldn’t even think she was a she if not for her big “plots”. Back to the animation, everyone had a stable role in the show; distinctive personality to match themselves and flawless picking of Seiyuu to voice them. The development of the characters weren’t that bad at all.<br />
It seems like Takamiya has a knack for being unconscious every episode and when he wakes up, he shouts Kagari-san almost always. It’s not that bad, though, considering it’s a light seinen (more like a shounen for me) series from the start and he seems like to possess every being and characteristic of an idjet MC. <br />
The blending from both the female MC and male MC is good, too. Although, I think they’ve been switched. With the entire cool-beauty aura surrounding Kagari and the feminine side of Takamiya who loves penguins. They complement each other well.<br />

Enjoyment: 8<br />
I enjoyed Witch Craft Works a bit more than I should. It’s definitely one of the better shows I’ve seen so far. Everyone has a genre they prefer to watch. As for me, I am a fan of these kinds of show, so you can say I’m a bit biased here. I don’t want to sound overacting on how I liked the show and making your expectation of it high, so I’ll stop here.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Overall, Witch Craft Works’ is not a superb show. But I’m not gonna deny its entertainment value. It was able to amuse me. And the other thing I liked about it was the light-hearted theme it possesses, unlike other dark-themed seinen shows out there. Tbh, I think it should be changed into a shounen rather than seinen. There are a lot of questions in need of answers, so I’m expecting a season two or some sort of sequel to it. All in all, Witch Craft Works is not a bad show. It won’t blow you off like other big-time series out there, but it’ll definitely pique your interest.<br />

      For an anime that has a lot of characters for a one season series, the focus is quite firmly on Takamiya Honoka (one of only two males in the series, not that I&#039;m complaining) and Kagari Ayaka, the main characters and practically the heroes of the series, the good guys you&#039;re supposed to root for. The story, full of mystery and the unknown at first, progressed nicely for the first 8 episodes, then I lost track of who wanted what and had to ask my younger brother for clarification, which was a bit humbling. The series didn&#039;t have much variety to the humor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183917">
        it brought to the episodes, but Kuraishi Tanpopo&#039;s karaoke was a blast to watch. The voice actress of Kuraishi, well chosen for her part, gave a sidesplitting performance. It was a scene that I watched again and again, and bolstered the ratings of Witch Craft Works.<br />
<br />
  The artwork, and often the computer graphics integrated in the drawing cells was perhaps, maybe, arguably the best I&#039;ve ever seen in the 30 years I&#039;ve been watching anime. Of course, anime from the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s can&#039;t hold a candle to the extravagant and lush and imaginative and fanciful, breathtaking visuals that anime studios bring us these days. The genre of this series must be fantasy. It surpasses even Paprika in terms of trippiness. I say that with a firm assertion. The lowest scores of Witch Craft come in the story and character departments. The big reveal of all this hustle bustle is that not only EVERYTHING comes back to what it was at the start, but EVERYONE also. That is, there&#039;s no ending, happy or sad. There&#039;s no development from the characters. Ayaka never had much in terms of personality. Her schtick is to be icy, detached, cold but blindly devoted to Takamiya for reasons that are hinted at to tease us, but never revealed. She&#039;s the one who stays the most normal during these episodic escapades, and frankly it suits her. It&#039;s Honoka that fails lamentably in growing, growing up, evolving any sort of emotion beyond hopelessness and mild stress and confusion. He never grows into the role he has been entrusted. Having frozen everybody&#039;s interactions and interface, the story makes everything go back to normal. THAT was hard to take. It was a case of Simpsonland.<br />
<br />
  The type of magic used in Witch Craft is about bond and bartering. The bomb girl, Evermilion, a very annoying villain, seemed overpowered and her constant victories seem to undermine the invincible Ayaka. She even took out, seemingly, even Ayaka&#039;s powerful mother, who has been subtly and indirectly hyped up as the most powerful witch in that town.The type of magic used, is quite convenient, too much, and servile to the caprice of the story and is subject to the vagaries of the plot. Yet, the visuals are still at the service of the story, unlike most non anime and live action series I&#039;ve seen. There has been quite some imagination spent into fleshing out this world. The worlds in between, the alternate dimensions are all memorable and intricate. There have been quite a few anime (cough, K, cough), that have put all their onus on the artwork and failed in all other respects. Witch Craft Works is an arresting series with a lot of heart, and I appreciated it very much, proof of which is reflected in my scores and this review. I definitely recommend it and will remember watching it for a long time.

    &quot;Witch Craft Works&quot; manages to take a few cliches/average plots (weak main male characters surrounded by strong women, some harem, good and evil fighting for the main character because they have immense power they have no idea about, etc) and not completely beat them to death. In fact, they played around with their boundaries, breathed new life into them and all the while told a pretty good story along the way.<br />
<br />
However, I truly think this show could have benefited from a few more episodes to allow for more development and storytelling, but I think it did well for the small period it had to cover

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191249">
        everything. Very little was left unexplained but the full background to Kagari and Takimaya&#039;s relationship was cut short and never finished which is rather disappointing. But I also have to commend them for not basing this on the obvious romance that could have erupted between the two main characters, but rather the bond/contract they share and how they have to grow with one another rather than simply being together.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
As I said before, there&#039;s a few cliches, but overall it&#039;s enjoyable. It can feel rushed because they want to get all the big points put into 12 episodes, but if you can look past that little detail then watching this series is a breeze.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
All the art seemed so average to me. Nothing too special, but not particularly bad either. Even my mom commented on the graphics being &quot;lame&quot; when she saw what I was watching. And that&#039;s all there is to it - the graphic didn&#039;t wow me or dazzle me and were just... there. Evermillion, Kagari in full-fledged Fire Witch form and the intricacy of the development of the tattoos on Kagari/Takimaya that would form are the only things that were moderately stunning.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
It was good, well placed and never overpowering.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
There could have been a little more development in this area. The fact that the tower witches motives were purposefully left so vague worked out at first, but I think individual characters should have made their motives known. I mean, if all of these witches knew about Takimaya then why are they finally attacking now? This is also a failed plot point. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, I do like how they made it seem like Kagari was carefree (which mostly came off as lack of emotion), but would periodically reveal something that showed otherwise through flashbacks and small breaks. Also Kagari and Takimaya are phenomenal foils of each other that meet on certain levels; her lack of emotion is countered by his deep caring and emotional desires to keep everyone safe and their recklessness, for various reasons, show their similarities. <br />
<br />
Each witch from their respective side managed to have their own distinct personality and most showed why they were on their particular side.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
The overall enjoyment of the series is definitely high. At times, the show was extremely cute and at others it kept me engaged in the fights as I wondered how Kagari could do all she did and walk out just fine. And really, the characters were all pretty likable in their own right. <br />
<br />
I would definitely recommend this anime. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s for everyone (but there&#039;s not a single anime that is, honestly), but I think it&#039;s worth taking a chance with.

    SPOILER ALERT* All I have to say is, so someone&#039;s life is on the line, and you can&#039;t kiss them on the lips, until you are married??? what is he, 5 years old?? Why does every anime hold kisses on such a grand level like they are about to get married? Most of the show was good but the last episode really annoyed me. Someone that you have feelings for died for you, and they add kind of a comedic part, of him joking around about how embarrassing it is to kiss someone. I guess i might understand a little if he was too embarrassed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268656">
        to do it in a normal situation but for him to think like that when someone is about to die is absurd.<br />
<br />
Besides that part, i think the story was good. There are many animes that are so similar that you couldn&#039;t tell them apart if they had the same name, but there very few anime that use the &quot;older girl&quot; type feeling. Also the story, and the direction  it went was a little different from most as well. Many might complain that no one died, but this is a lighthearted type story, and it would make the story too dark if someone really did die. Even the villains on the show did not give off such  a dark vibe.<br />
<br />
If I could add something to the show, i wish the show could have been longer, and it would have been kind of cool to see the MC learning how to fight on his own. At first i thought that was going to happen when he asked her to train him, but in the end she was too protective of him to train him other than teaching him how to run away if something went wrong.<br />
<br />
If someone asked me if they should watch the show, i would say it depends on what they are looking for. If they are looking for a full on romance, or a combat type show, i would not recommend it because in the end they never really are together. But if you like a lighthearted romance that never tells the watcher that they like each other but the watcher understands by watching it, it is a perfect show to watch. This is the type of shows i look forward to every seasons while waiting for the 9 or 10 rating anime to finish.
