    A mediocre story, typical high-school setting, unnecessarily convoluted magic system, and lots and lots of fanservice. Trinity Seven would have been utterly average and forgettable if it wasn&#039;t for its characters.<br />
<br />
The MC is, for once, not as dense as a brick, which already puts him ahead of majority of other harem leads. Arata is powerful and competent, so he doesn&#039;t have to be protected by the girls all the time. He&#039;s also unapologetically perverted, and it&#039;s quite refreshing to see him handle the inevitable ecchi situations with humor and honesty instead of stuttered apologies.<br />
<br />
Most of the girls are rather likeable as well, from the prudish

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174363">
        and easily-embarrassed Lilith (a great target for Arata&#039;s teasing) to the mischievous and confident Levi, who developed a certain camaraderie with the MC and even goes along with his perverted jokes. Their interactions with Arata and each other are usually quite entertaining. Violent tsundere tendencies, while present in one or two characters, are thankfully toned down. <br />
<br />
TL;DR Trinity Seven is an otherwise average harem carried by an awesome male lead and charming female characters.

    I feel the best way I can sum it up would be in a pros and cons list:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Good intro, I really liked the way the plot started.<br />
- Arata: A Main Character who isn&#039;t as dense as lead, and was also hilarious. One thing that I realized I liked was that he wasn&#039;t as overpowered as any other anime would have made him.<br />
- Aiko: One of the supporting characters in the Trinity Seven. There was something different about her from other female characters of any anime. She stood out to me the most (besides MC).<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Horrible plot development. Just so messy.I almost dropped it because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175645">
        it bothered me that much.<br />
- The amount of fan service. I do like a bit myself, but there comes a point where it&#039;s too much. Trinity Seven goes past that point.<br />
- Every female character, other than Aiko.<br />
- Character development was atrocious. Nothing was explained well. For example, what are any of the &quot;processes&quot;? What actual powers do the grimories have? <br />
- Hijiri: To not include any spoilers, I won&#039;t describe much. As I watched, I just wanted to say what the actual F? If you decide to watch the anime, you&#039;ll understand.<br />
<br />
I will say that this anime is on the lower end of my spectrum of choice. I think that the story would have been executed better in a longer season.

    Trinity Seven ~8~<br />
<br />
So ~ the end of this anime season is approaching and I find myself, once again, trying to come up with reasonable ratings for the various anime which I followed over the past months.<br />
~ Unsafeman121 Dec 2014<br />
<br />
~ Plot ~<br />
~8~<br />
Very intriguing and at first slightly mysterious, the plot makes you keep wanting some more. There many times at which the episode ended and I just wanted to be able to continue watching. It seems fairly well thought out and the happenings all seem to fit into the world well. There are times when parts could be explained a little bit more clearly, such as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175427">
        in the Library section, however I feel that this did not detract from my enjoyment of the anime. Each &quot;section&quot; feels like it brings everything a little bit closer together and it is very satisfying to watch. There are very few times where I felt there wasn&#039;t progress in the plot, and yet still a good amount of character development is achieved. The combination of these two make this anime a worthy watch.<br />
<br />
~Sound~<br />
~7~<br />
Although I did not particularly enjoy either the OP or ED of this anime, I felt that the voices were VERY well suited to the characters, everything fits well and it certainly helps the ease with which one can watch this anime. I didn&#039;t find any issue with any background music that played in the anime, and wasn&#039;t distracted by any of it, but in the same regard, it didn&#039;t blow me away as anything incredible.<br />
<br />
~Visuals~<br />
~8~<br />
Personally, I enjoyed the visuals, I felt as if they were above average for an anime of this type and I was sometimes impressed by certain backgrounds or settings. You can tell that effort has been put in to make this anime look great, and it is another reason for which this anime is so enjoyable to watch. It is well detailed and there are few things about it which I would change if I had the choice. (You can tell they put lots of effort into the fanservice ;) )<br />
<br />
~Characters~<br />
~9~<br />
One of the strong points about this anime, the characters are all very likable and well made. There is sufficient character development (for an anime of this length), that you feel for some of the characters and get to know them a little bit more than in some other anime. There is an incredible mix of characters, and each on adds to the feeling of the anime. They each have their traits and they all seem to function well together in terms of interaction. It doesn&#039;t feel like any of the characters make any of the others redundant. The way in which they can synergise their powers is clever and I feel that this was a slightly more unique aspect.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~<br />
~9~<br />
This is one of the anime which I have thoroughly enjoyed. There are several reasons for this, though obviously as I don&#039;t want to give any spoilers, I will not mention many of them. A lot of they enjoyment I feel, came from the very well written script and the interactions of the characters with each other and their relationships.<br />
<br />
~Overall~<br />
~8~ <br />
&quot;This was more enjoyable to watch than the average anime, would recommend to others.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this anime is above par and one that I would recommend to people, even if they hadn&#039;t specifically mentioned the title themselves. There is a great mix of characters, their voices fit and the plot is great. This is one of the better anime out of the ones I have been watching this season (4th release date of 2014)<br />
<br />
For those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:<br />
This is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.<br />
<br />
E01: 7<br />
E04: 7<br />
E08: 7<br />
E09: 8 (Rated up 1)<br />
E12: 8

Where most people worry about what to get their family members for the holidays, others are more concerned about the actual state of the world. Global warming, earthquakes, and solar flares are all major issues that scientists and those worried about the Earth&#039;s future are thinking about daily. They wonder if these types of disasters can be avoided, to prevent the destruction of the place we call home.<br />
<br />
Whether or not anything is ultimately preventable is certainly a courageous endeavor, often needing help from the many and not the few. This sets the stage for Trinity Seven, a stage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174259">
        filled with breasts, harems, and not much more.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Trinity Seven begins with Arata, a young man who loses his cousin Hijiri to a &quot;collapse phenomenon,&quot; prompting him to leave with Lilith to a magical high school where he discovers he is the next &quot;demon lord candidate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trinity Seven is classified as a harem, and it puts a lot of stock into this portion of the show, focusing on the girls&#039; varying personalities, antics, and general adoration of Arata. The anime attempts to switch up the pairings where it can, giving the show comedy and the like to leverage. Overall, this gives the series a competent amount of shenanigans to follow.<br />
<br />
It all goes downhill when it is not focusing on this side, however. One of Trinity Seven&#039;s largest issues comes from the cast itself. The anime is constantly throwing out new characters from start to finish. This is not an exaggeration; literally until the final episode, new characters are being shown. Being an entirely character driven show, one would think that such an endeavor would be acceptable.<br />
<br />
But it doesn&#039;t work. As more and more characters are brought in, two more problems arise. The older characters are not given enough screen-time, causing them all to lack development and caring towards them needed by the audience. At the same time, the newer characters, given their later and later introductions, suffer the same fate. No character is given enough time to be properly explored, making the cast become props to ogle at rather than well-defined people. It&#039;s a vicious cycle that persists throughout the entire season, bringing about an unsavory amount of chaos.<br />
<br />
The biggest flaw comes from the plot itself. Much of what occurs is completely nonsensical in nature due to the exorbitant amount of terminology the anime throws at the audience. &quot;Archives,&quot; &quot;Themas,&quot; and other foreign words are tossed around as if the audience is supposed to simply understand why they are being used or where they originate. The anime never delves into any sort of world-building, merely saying phrases in passing or nonchalantly talking about how certain aspects of their magic work. There is no pretext, context, or subtext for anything that goes on. Both the overall arc and sub-plots contain this problem, throwing the entire experience into disarray.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Generally less than stellar, Trinity Seven adopts rather awkward techniques for both its art and animation.<br />
<br />
Beginning with the art style, the characters are typically set to CGI backgrounds. This allows them to stand out more noticeably when compared to other anime, mainly because of the jarring juxtaposition of 3D and 2D elements. The anime looks better when it is not using such a trick, but even then, the unvarying amount of locations that are visited provides little in the way of intrigue.<br />
<br />
However, another part fares better, arguably being the best part of the show: the girls and their character designs. Ranging from elegant to slutty, bodacious to simple, they all maintain the same style but differ when it comes to overall looks, faces, hair, outfits, etc. They&#039;re varied enough and interesting enough within the anime to be a positive force.<br />
<br />
The actual animation, though, is sorely a negative. Character movements are often kept to a minimum and many shots consist of only one character at a time. The most notable drop in animation comes from the &quot;fight&quot; scenes. They are meant to be small duels or skirmishes, but they are never really depicted as such. Quick cuts, simple attacks, and more often than not refusing to show the action itself demonstrates just how little animation there really is.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Being a harem, Trinity Seven contains a large main cast. More specifically, and perhaps obviously, there are seven young women who take the spotlight. I&#039;ll stick to talking about Arata and my favorite four.<br />
<br />
As a main character, Arata is actually not immensely dense. Perverse and funny, he allows the Trinity Seven themselves to shine as much as possible. Determined to see his cousin once more, he goes to great lengths to accomplish the goals he sets for himself. As a new demon lord candidate, he is able to control magic as he wills. It&#039;s this and his all-around likability that causes the girls to flock to him, despite his affinity for all things debauched.<br />
<br />
Acting as the head of the defense department, Mira is a shorter woman who does not tolerate any form of impure thoughts or actions. Extremely shy yet demanding, she usually butts heads with Arata due to their opposite, base ideals. Her strong suit is being capable of reflecting or disabling any form of magic. Her highly defensive combat abilities also manifest in her personality, making her difficult to approach let alone talk to. However, the more time she spends with Arata, the further her shell cracks, revealing a more comfortable and caring friend.<br />
<br />
Liese is a succubus first and magic-user second. Relying almost entirely on her well-endowed assets, she utilizes her sex appeal to its fullest potential. Her playful nature causes her to invade people&#039;s privacy regularly. She has no qualms making others feel uncomfortable, since she is so content with her own body and her sexuality. To aid her in this process, she is able to bend time to her will. Liese starts off as a tough antagonist, aiming to become the next &quot;demon lord&quot; before Arata. But due to his affable personality, she transitions from difficult foe to treasured companion, presenting an argument to the saying, &quot;time heals all wounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yui is a strange girl, to say the least. She exists within two separate dimensions at the same time: one in the real world and another in a dream-like state. The former is incredibly happy, carefree, and quick to call Arata &quot;Onii-san&quot; whenever she is given the chance. Her dream-self is quiet and calm, producing an aura of elegance that the rest of the girls do not own. Her magic takes on a supportive role, boosting the power of those around her. Being the first of the Trinity Seven that brings Arata hardship to &quot;capture,&quot; when she is ultimately saved, her supportive attitude shines through, making her an extremely wonderful addition to the cast.<br />
<br />
Technically the poster-girl for the show, Lilith is Arata&#039;s mentor and first of the girls to give her trust. Easily embarrassed, sincere, and willing to guide people down the right path, she is most often found looking after Arata. Her beauty is unrivaled, and so are her skills as a professor. She is at maximum cuteness when she is blushing after being teased or hearing/seeing Arata say/do something slightly perverted. Her abilities take the form of handheld weapons -- guns -- that shoot out magic with high speed and intensity. While she incessantly yells at Arata for his continuous behavior, deep down, like the guns she wields, her emotions and feelings for him are incredibly strong and unyielding.<br />
<br />
Along with the other three (Levi, Arin, and Akio), and a few of the other side cast, each of them have their own descriptions and a connection between their personality and the skills they have. While the entire cast is neither fleshed out nor too memorable, there is bound to be someone here for everyone to enjoy.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP for the anime is actually quite good. The beginning part with the hard guitar and choir-like singing starts the piece off strong. The middle section follows suit, with guitar, drums, and vocals working well in unison. The halfway point, with the &quot;falling&quot; effects in the singing and drums causes one to bob their head to the beat. Just the nice amount of variety from the piece makes it stand out from the pact.<br />
<br />
You may be able to choose the destination, but you shouldn&#039;t choose the first ED. It&#039;s a mess of singing and instruments that is not pleasant to listen to.<br />
<br />
The second ED takes a slightly slower approach that works miles better than the first. Its float-y feel and &quot;shavadava,&quot; alongside the more onomatopoeia vocals, make it a fun song to hear, coinciding with the stronger parts of the anime. It is Arguably the best of the EDs.<br />
<br />
ED number three goes back to being quick, and subsequently back to being bad. It&#039;s a rather strange song, containing a piano melody and both fast and higher singing that don&#039;t work well together.<br />
<br />
The final ED is the worst of the bunch. Nothing attributed to the song seems to flow, creating an even worse amalgamation than what the first ending piece offered. The techno background beat and mid-range vocals create an awkward arrangement that doesn&#039;t fit well with the anime, as well as making it rather forgettable.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack mostly consists of ambient pieces filled with violins and darker tones that fit the more &quot;evil&quot; vibe the show contains during the more serious portions. However, none of the tracks are noteworthy.<br />
<br />
The voice-acting within the anime is average, with no notable performances to be had.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
When it comes to an anime like this, it prioritizes the harem and the comedy first with story and characters coming in at a distant second. In that regard, the show does well, making me chuckle with its various scenes and silly moments.<br />
<br />
When the anime tried to make the action and plot its focus, I really just wanted them to go back to the comedy and the harem elements that it was doing so well at. And as the series progressed, it started fixating its eyes on its weakest parts more and more, making the experience less fun the further along it went.<br />
<br />
For what it&#039;s worth, Trinity Seven tried to be more than just a run-of-the-mill harem. But its inability to balance the characters, its rather awful narrative (even among the genre), and strange decisions in regards to animation and music make the entire package less than average.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Bad, harem shenanigans, too many characters, terrible world-building<br />
<br />
Animation: Bad, jarring 2D/3D mix, nice character designs, little animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, Arata, Mira, Liese, Yui, and Lilith are okay, with someone for everyone<br />
<br />
Sound: Bad, good OP, bad EDs, okay soundtrack, average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Fine, fun to watch only when the harem and the comedy are the focus<br />
<br />
Final Score: 3/10

    A &quot;Harem&quot; is a magical word used to describe every straight male&#039;s ideal reality in which every single girl he comes in counter with wants to hop on his yaoi stick. The harem is typically courted by a dense male lead and at least five girls -- each with a different hair color than the others. This male lead will then become involved in at least three scenarios (Per episode) in which he accidentally touches one of these girls in one of their private areas and thus receives a slap in the face, followed by blushing and an occasional punch that defies the laws of

        physics and sends him skyrocketing across the galaxy. Trinity Seven is an atypical representation concerning this definition of &quot;Harem&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kasuga Arata (Only dude pictured above) isn&#039;t your typical dense &quot;Omg I have no idea you want to bang me&quot; protagonist. This is where a lot of the charm Trinity Seven has to offer comes into play. We meet him as the world he resides in is being torn to shreds, ultimately ending humanity. In his final moments, his cousin hands him a necklace/grimoire-thingy (Before falling into a crevice opening up in the world) which contains a magical entity that will allow him to essentially re-shape the world on a journey to find that cousin. However, in order to do that, he must become acquainted with the &quot;Trinity Seven&quot; which is the name given to the seven magus females that all want to swallow his mana.<br />
<br />
But the cool thing about Trinity Seven is that it never really feels dull. It&#039;s predictable in a good way, which sounds weird at first -- but makes sense in context. You won&#039;t grow to hate the main character, which is a common flaw that harems typically encounter as they progress. This all culminates in one of the most surprisingly entertaining shows to come out of Fall 2014. In order to better illustrate this, let me break it up into a few key components.<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
Trinity Seven sports a soundtrack that is infused with hard-rock, techno, funk, and some sweet-ass bass lines. It&#039;s actually quite good when listening to it even out of context. The music never seems like it&#039;s &quot;Just there&quot;. It serves as a good sidekick during fight scenes and allows the audience to keep their eyes fixed to the screen without feeling distracted or irritated by overly-obnoxious music typically prevalent in action-sequences. On top of this, the opening song is pretty damn catchy and becomes an essential part of every episode that almost anyone would look forward to.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
The best part of this show really lies within the characters. Each one carries their own distinct personality and complements the protagonist almost perfectly. In harems, another common problem is how viewers will basically choose one girl that they want the protagonist to end up with. This results in hate bubbling up for the other girls and eventually ends up on some message-board like /a/ where everyone argues about who is &quot;Best girl&quot;. In Trinity Seven, it&#039;s actually pretty hard to decide who you want to &quot;Win&quot;. To be perfectly honest, I still don&#039;t know which girl would make the best pairing with Arata. Maybe Mira. Or Lilith. I don&#039;t know, just let me keep Levi to myself. Anyway, it&#039;s this aspect that makes the characters enjoyable all-around. One thing I would have liked to see though, would be character development for anyone outside of Arata. Everyone seems kind of snug within their own niche, not ever changing from who they already are.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
At first, I didn&#039;t know how I felt about the visuals that were put in front of me in Trinity Seven. Three episodes later, I adored it. There was just that period of &quot;Mehhhh&quot; time it took for me to feel it out. I felt the same way about Madoka Magica when I watched that, and now I think it&#039;s one of the most beautiful shows I&#039;ve ever seen. Trinity Seven shouldn&#039;t really be compared to Madoka outside of the &quot;Girls with magical powers&quot; thing, but you probably understand what I mean when I say you might not like it at first. Just give it some time. I promise. In addition to the general artwork, character designs were unique and impressive. It appeared as if the artists actually put love and care into each one, treating them more as actual characters than curious teenage girls waiting to be taken advantage of after meeting a boy for the first time. Each one was extremely different from the others (Apart from Lieselotte and Selina, but you know...twins) and I never got tired of seeing them.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Trinity Seven has a solid story. Is it great? No, not by any means. But it&#039;s more than you&#039;ll normally find in this genre. The protagonist actually has a goal that he is constantly moving toward. The side-characters try their best to aid him in this endeavor. It just works out. There are periods where things seem bleak, but those periods are then counteracted by others that seem hopeful. Each episode actually goes somewhere, which is a feat that so many shows struggle with nowadays. The series even ends on a note that will allow for another season or two if season one sells well enough. Hell, I might even pick up manga one day if I get bored enough. Once again, solid storytelling by writer, Kenji Saitou, and director, Hiroshi Nishikiori.<br />
<br />
All in all, Trinity Seven is a very well-rounded harem/comedy with a few fight scenes thrown in for action and a story that actually goes somewhere. If you are a fan of fan-service, character design, or laughing, I would give it a try. It definitely surprised me and became an easy favorite for the year of 2014.

    Another harem anime  with a bit of a unique twist in all it fan service that is provided. While they almost always get pound in the typical accidental pervert seens. This one is a bit different, with the main character being more open and honest, and all the women bashing him in a more realistic manner it brings a more refreshing feel to this anime that is rarely seen. Story leaves out some info on what is going on from the get go. And your left to piece it together throughout the majority of the anime. With the plot left on the stove to

        thicken as you go it keeps you intrigued as to why exactly everything is going on and by the end found myself wanting more. I would definitely appreciate a 2nd season.

              In my short time of reviewing anime, I&#039;ve covered quite a few different types of harems. I&#039;ve done dramatic harems, reverse harems, and even harems that didn&#039;t start out as harems. However, I realized recently that I&#039;ve never done a review for just a regular old comedic harem, so I decided to pick one up for this season. Upon finishing the series, I realized that everything I want to say about it could pretty much apply to every other comedic harem I&#039;ve seen. So, aside from the specific anime I&#039;m covering today, consider this as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173835">
        an appropriate substitute review for any other generic comedic harem you can think of (Rosario + Vampire, Highschool DxD, Infinite Stratos, Maken-ki!, etc.), as I rattle off the list of traits that this genre keeps using over and over and over again to make itself as bland and marketable as possible.<br />
<br />
1. Fantasy setting or heavy fantasy elements, usually involving magic<br />
          While more traditional and realistic settings may have worked back in the heyday of harems like Love Hina, the incorporation of fantasy elements serves as a replacement for actually making the viewer believe that this type of romantic setup could occur in the first place. Additionally, the use of magic creates a plethora of possibilities for getting the female characters into situations of a lewd and nearly-naked nature, with very minimal effort on the part of the writer. For Trinity Seven, we end up with one of Arata&#039;s main powers being the ability to make people&#039;s clothes disappear, providing plenty of fan service fun.<br />
<br />
2. Story still manages to take place in a high school of some kind<br />
          I&#039;m not sure what the exact percentage is of anime that take place in high school, but I&#039;m going to assume it&#039;s a relatively high number, and within the harem genre the reason for that is very simple: it attracts viewers who are currently in high school. Additionally, with Trinity Seven, we get bonus points added for the high school being an all-girls school (while it&#039;s never explicitly stated that this is the case, no other male students seem to appear in this school). This further allows for Arata to be given free reign over whatever love interest the series decides to throw in for our enjoyment.<br />
<br />
3. Actual story and magic lore is incredibly convoluted and pointless<br />
          For obvious reasons, writers can&#039;t just get away with writing absolutely nothing but fan service moments, so of course there has to be some kind of story. However, writing an actual story would make it too difficult for the viewers to focus on those wonderfully-animated breasts you just shoved into frame [heavy-handed sarcasm], so the plot needs to be flimsy, shallow, and easily tradable with any other generic plot. Every magic term in Trinity Seven is practically thrown in your face one after another with little more than a one-sentence description of what it actually does. That didn&#039;t really matter though, because I couldn&#039;t even count the times where I just flat-out looked away from the screen for a minute or so and then turned back to realize that absolutely nothing has happened other than some more flashy magic terminology and a panty shot.<br />
<br />
4. Random climactic battle at the end of the series<br />
          ...yeah that&#039;s just kind of a thing I guess. I suppose they have to at least pretend that they&#039;re putting some kind of effort into their writing at the end of the series.<br />
<br />
5. Always, ALWAYS leave room for a second season<br />
          The harem genre is surprisingly easy to market and sell to viewers, so it&#039;s important to keep the money train going until no one shows any interest in your specific series anymore.<br />
<br />
6. Main character has some kind of power that no one else has<br />
          To be fair, this is a trait that&#039;s common even outside the harem genre, but within harems it adds something entirely different. With an action series, being the only one with a certain power or ability makes you humanity&#039;s last hope for survival. In a harem, it makes you an object of desire. Of course all the ladies want to jump your bones; you&#039;re the only person here who has this super awesome power. In the case of Trinity Seven, Arata is the &quot;Demon Lord Candidate&quot; who has the potential to turn into the Demon Lord, one of the most powerful beings in the world. Another important note is that the power in question is incredibly generic and normally just equates to &quot;I&#039;m stronger than everyone else because reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
7. Main character is either overtly perverted or a shy nice guy (who&#039;s still incredibly perverted on the inside), but is also incredibly noble<br />
          Again, to be fair to Trinity Seven, Arata certainly falls into the former category, and he becomes so blatant with his perversity that it&#039;s almost hard to not like him for it (almost being the important word there). As for the nobility aspects, it plays into why the girls fall for him in the first place. I mean sure he&#039;s super perverted but he&#039;s just this super nice guy that I can rely on underneath all of that [more heavy-handed sarcasm]. Everything about a harem is designed to make the main male character look awesome, and Trinity Seven certainly doesn&#039;t miss its mark.<br />
<br />
8. Female characters have no depth other than their assigned archetypes<br />
          When you have this many female love interests on your cast, it&#039;s nearly impossible to give them enough characterization to make them feel fleshed-out while still finding time for fan service moments, so the best course of action is to flood your series with as many archetypes as you can: the childhood friend (Hijiri), the plain Jane (Lilith), the loli (Grimoire), the tsundere (Mira), the kooky one (Levi), the childish one (Yui), the tomboy (Akio), ad nauseam.<br />
<br />
9. Primary love interest is as bland as a piece of notebook paper<br />
          If the love interest that the main character is eventually going to end up with actually has a personality, the writers run the risk of the viewers not enjoying that specific archetype, so it&#039;s always best to choose the one with the least amount of personality possible (and also the biggest cup size). Of course, the two characters in question will never actually reach the point where they could be considered to be in a relationship. I mean lord forbid that you actually do something romantically interesting with your characters.<br />
<br />
10. All animation budget goes towards character designs and boob physics<br />
          The fan service is the main selling point of a harem, so it&#039;s absolutely vital that this is achieved, often at the cost of the rest of the animation looking terrible. Studio Seven Arcs knows this very well and gave us exactly that. While the action in Trinity Seven wasn&#039;t completely awful, the particle and light effects certainly weren&#039;t anything worthy of praise, and backgrounds and moving objects were often rendered in the most eye-jarring 3D I&#039;ve seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
11. Fan service out the wazoo<br />
          This one doesn&#039;t really need much explanation. You&#039;re certainly not watching this because the romance is so unbelievably captivating.<br />
<br />
12. Soundtrack occupies the background for the majority of the anime&#039;s run time<br />
          I honestly can&#039;t even think of a single note from this soundtrack off the top of my head right now, and I just finished the last episode about an hour ago. In this case, the soundtrack was composed by Technoboys Pulcraft Green-Fund (Witch Craft Works), and I wouldn&#039;t necessarily blame them for the blandness of the soundtrack because this is a harem after all, and there isn&#039;t exactly a long list of standout harem soundtracks.<br />
<br />
          Overall, I do think that anime viewers should experience a simple comedic harem at least once, but Trinity Seven certainly isn&#039;t the one I would recommend as an introduction to the genre.

    Overall rating should be 8 but...<br />
---<br />
Trinity Seven is a decent Action/Comedy/Ecchi Anime, so if you are not a fan of ecchi, please skip this one. I mean it&#039;s very decent anime, but it&#039;s not good enough to make you start liking ecchi or something. Anyway, for those who have intention of going for this one, let me encourage you. I won&#039;t spoil anything.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
A guy whose cousin disappeared one day decided to learn magic to get her back. Then he went to a magic school, where he met the Trinity Seven AND where his real story began... To be honest, the story is not really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175003">
        impressive. It has some flaws, it&#039;s weird, it doesn&#039;t really have anything outstanding. You will find awkward and funny moments along with VERY VERY stupid situations and you have to wonder: &quot;Wtf, why won&#039;t they attack instead of talking&quot;. However, in the end, the story is truly enjoyable and I say that you may want to give it a try.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art is good, but not quite impressive. You will find most anime today, 2014, have similar art level and some shows have even better art. Don&#039;t expect anything memorable from the art of this show because it&#039;s just enough for you to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Totally personal experience: I don&#039;t find any of the songs catchy so I will give it a 7.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Seriously, you will have a hard time finding a second female main character like in Trinity Seven: Arata Kasuga. Besides the fact that he is a very caring and nice person, he is perverted, kind of like obvious in an ecchi anime, but he doesn&#039;t hesitate to show it out. Also, he is NOT stupid. He knows that the girls have feelings for him and he is willing to accept it.<br />
Also, Lilith Asami is a very cute girl :D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I have to say I really enjoy it. It&#039;s not an outstanding anime, it may not get your intention, but I like it. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
BUT +1 due to the fact that I have a good time watching the show.<br />
---<br />
Give the show a try and make the judgement on your own. The show&#039;s worth it.

    With the end of the year 2014 its finally time to also close one of the darkest chapters of my entire life. A chapter which is known as Trinity Seven. Really. I don&#039;t even know why I went all the way watching it to the end. Still, its an interesting experience.<br />
<br />
Even though its just something along the lines of &#039;Whew, now I really can point my finger on an anime that is actually... bad.&#039;<br />
<br />
Back to serious mode. Obviously I&#039;m still going to be fair with this anime.<br />
First of all, storywise. What does this anime have in store for us?<br />
The mainstory is reasonable simple and catchy.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175763">
        Our MC Arata looses  his cousin Hijiri to a magical phenomenom. So far so well. Thats nothing too bad, it explains what we should have to expect for the next episodes. But why do I dislike the story so much then? Simple. That phenomenom is called &#039;Breakdown Phenomenom&#039; and is just the first of billions of mechanics which is fired in your face with the speed of a minigun and the power of a railgun. Followed up by Themas and some latin words, sudden english imputs like Limit Breaks, irish legends (Brioriac and Fragrach), etc. The setting of this anime just sucks so hard. Nothing really gets explained in a roundabout way, and even after 12 episodes the only thing I got is that the thema is supposedly the exact opposite to your character. But its not like this is all which sucks storywise. The story is mainly a gauntlet of boobsfondling scenes, slice of life, and obvious plottwists. Just awfully done.<br />
So overall, I rated the story 3/10.<br />
<br />
Next are the artworks. The character designs aren&#039;t too bad, even though their colors are a bit pale. Also, I always got annoyed with their faces. They look mostly emotionless, and if you leave away the hairstyles, identical. The backgrounds are no awardwinners either. They are good enough to stand their ground. They aren&#039;t too sharp, but are rather colorful. A strange contrast to the grayish-pale characters. Lastly the battlescenes. Swordattacks are the usual black-screen/cut style ones. Uhh... really good, I guess? Nope. The magic isn&#039;t that much better, mostly laserbeams and glowing stuff and such.<br />
Which brings me to 5/10 for the Artworks.<br />
<br />
The sound is the best part of Trinity Seven. By far. Lets start with the voice actors. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu aka. Kirito returns. Matsuoka-san isn&#039;t new to ecchi by any means, as he also voiced the MC of Mangaka-san to Assist-san to. His performance is as good as ever. The rest of the cast isn&#039;t really memorable, but they depicted their characters good enough. The OSTs of Trinity Seven on the other hand were mediocre. As for battle soundtracks we have some mechanical/techno/futuristic kind of music, which reminds me of a worse version of Xenoblade&#039;s Mechanical rhythm. The rest of the time the BGM fits the situation without being memorable.<br />
Finally the OP/ED. Seven Doors by ZAQ is a fairly good song, which made it into my 2014 favorites. It got me hyped up for the following 20 minutes and is one of the sole reasons I continued to watch.<br />
7/10 for sounds.<br />
<br />
Finally we arrived at Trinity Sevens&#039; achilles heel. The characters.<br />
If you wonder what exactly is bad about them? Probably everything.<br />
The Initial character designs are rather flat. None of the characters feel fresh or new. I&#039;ve seen not completely dense MCs before, and the rest of the Trinity Seven reeks of stereotypes.<br />
I don&#039;t even remember whether the girls have backgroundstories or not. As for the interactions between the characters, those aren&#039;t any better. Most of the slice of life parts circle around groping boobs, or how lewd Arata is. Whew. Amazing... Finally, the character development. Basically the females all fell for Arata. Thats all the development I got. Thats rather disappointing.<br />
For the last of the obejective categories I go with 4/10.<br />
<br />
And now the last one. The enjoyment.<br />
Well, you can see on my profile how I rate enjoyment. So lets just say 3/10.<br />
<br />
Overall 4/10.<br />
A just below average harem anime with more potential than turnout.<br />
The production values are rather high, but the execution of the plot, the setting, as well the characters are rather bad.<br />
<br />
Feedback is appreciated, as usual.

    Reconnect to the Invidia Archive.  Executing my Thema: Circumspicio!  What better way to introduce Trinity Seven, a series I&#039;ve personally dubbed one of the best entries in the harem genre, than an introduction like that?  <br />
<br />
Story (7.88/10):  The story of trinity seven is as follows.  A boy by the name of Arata finds himself in his normal life.  Waking up with his normal cousin making him breakfast, his normal walk to school, and even his normal everyday boob grab.  But, soon, he notices something...different.  The world around him has no one else nearby.  There are no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173989">
        people, and he notices that the sun is a malicious black.  Then, he gets threatened by a girl with a rifle saying to him about something called a breakdown phenomenon, and the fact that HE himself has caused it with his magic.  And from that point forward, Arata&#039;s life of leisure changes as he delves himself into the world of magic and gets to know the seven most powerful mages in the world, the Trinity Seven.<br />
<br />
Trinity seven is a very interesting show.  The best way to sum the show up in a few words is &quot;Harem with a Plot.&quot;  What makes Trinity Seven so much more different than other harem shows is the fact that the show itself does follow a chronological order of events.  It doesn&#039;t use ecchi as the &quot;audience bringer&quot; (although, there are enough ecchi moments to fill up two whole episode slots), and it does follow a proper plot, following Arata as he goes through his new life as a mage with the Trinity Seven.  <br />
<br />
Another thing that makes the show very unique is its brand of magic.  Like every other supernatural magic show, Trinity Seven boasts its own explanation for the idea of magic which is honestly one of the best points of the show.  This is due to the fact that the magic for the show is heavily integrated into the show&#039;s plot, giving explanation along the way for viewers.  But depending on the viewer, it can get a little difficult to understand due to the heavily thrown out terms that one must learn in order to fully enjoy this show.  (Things like macros, Themas, etc.)  <br />
<br />
In addition, Trinity seven hosts its own brand of comedy which is...well, subjective.  (It&#039;s harem, what do you expect?)  The entire show is littered with all sorts of innuendos, sexual suggestions, and boob grabbing.  Lots and lots of boob grabbing.  What makes this such a refreshing brand of comedy is just how free the characters are.  Many characters play along with the whole ecchi thing rather than being all embarrassed and shy, which makes the situations not just a standard ecchi moment, but a rather funny one.  In addition, the show&#039;s perverted nature rolls with the show and to my knowledge, hasn&#039;t made the show any less quality than it is from my viewpoint.  That being said, the show does have many, and I mean MANY scenes like this (you can expect one every five minutes of watching this show.) and can get distracting and put people off due to its sheer amount, as well as sometimes its absurdity.  (Like the all-powerful stripping magic.)<br />
<br />
Overall though, this show was a very faithful adaptation to the manga that this was based on.  The pacing was decent enough so that the viewer wouldn&#039;t get left behind on anything that was going on, and the story while still harem-related, followed events that really didn&#039;t have to do with a generic harem show, making the show as a whole, surprisingly good.  But while the show itself proves to be good, it does lack in a lot of explanation at the end.  There are many questions that (unless you&#039;ve read the manga) become left unanswered and really require this show to have a second season in order to continue the story, because this show ends on a cliffhanger that at the end of the day, doesn&#039;t please anyone.  (Cause really, the real story of Trinity seven only JUST started with the end of the last episode)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Harem with Plot   (you don&#039;t really see many of these.)<br />
+  Good story telling<br />
+  Decent pacing<br />
+/-  Interesting concept of magic  (Can ruin viewing experience if you don&#039;t quite get it.)<br />
+/-  Perverted comedy that works in conjunction with the show   (ruins viewing experience if you don&#039;t like ecchi<br />
-   Cliffhanger ending<br />
<br />
Characters (8.11/10):  Now, onto the real high points of Trinity Seven, the characters.  <br />
<br />
Kasuga Arata is the main protagonist/harem master of this series.  Now, what would we expect from a harem series from past experiences?  A guy with way too much luck having 3+ girls fall for him while being super nice and not noticing their feelings at all?  No!  Compared to many other harem protagonists, Arata is not a simple plot device, but rather has a personality of his own.  (Take that, Ichika.)  As something of a complete opposite to the normal harem protagonist, Arata has an extremely perverted personality, taking up any offers that the Trinity seven gives, and making any given perverted moment into a hilarious moment via monologue usually ending with &quot;Thanks for the Feast&quot;; not to mention, he is aware of the fact that some of the girls actually like him romantically.  As a result, Arata truly becomes a unique character because of how he reacts to different situations he&#039;s put in, as well as how much he breaks away from what we anime viewers know of the generic harem protagonist.  He&#039;s not afraid to try out something new in terms of magic (or girls) and he really shows motivation for the goal that he&#039;s put in front of himself.  <br />
<br />
And then we have the Trinity Seven.  Since they all account for the title of best girl, I&#039;ll try and summarize them the best I can in a few short words with a couple side notes for some of them.<br />
<br />
Lilith = Large chested tsundere that is a teacher and sort of the &quot;main girl&quot;.  (stick in the mud)<br />
Arin = Kuudere girl that proclaims herself as Arata&#039;s wife<br />
Levi = The ninja girl that is just as perverted as Arata is, making many suggestive suggestions.<br />
Yui = The big-chested loli Imouto character that has a crush on Arata.   (My personal favorite)<br />
Mira = The head of the disciplinary committee that&#039;s just a bit too strict. (Also a stick in the mud.)<br />
Akio = The big sister character that often laughs at Arata&#039;s constant perverted anctics<br />
Liese = The dark horse of the Trinity Seven with the personality of an alluring mistress.  (According to Arata, has the nicest legs.)<br />
<br />
The trinity seven is the show&#039;s core characters, with the entire plot revolving around Arata associating with these seven girls.  What gives the show a plus, as well as a negative is character development.  Some of these girls do have some backstory given to them.  Why they are a member of the trinity seven, what are their motives, and who they are as a person.  As a negative, they don&#039;t really do this to many of the girls, leading to some of the girls being a bit fleshed out, while other still stay in their one-note, but still enjoyable personalities.  <br />
<br />
As for side characters, the show has a wide host of different ones that get varying screentime, such as the Astil Codex Grimoire, the perverted headmaster, Arata&#039;s cousin Hijiri, and Selina.  These side characters for the most part are quite memorable.  They share similar traits to the main cast of being more unique and memorable than other characters previously seen before.  That being said, you don&#039;t really get to know TOO much about them, and they relatively stay in the role of providing conflict, or adding to the perverted moments of the series.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  FANTASTIC Harem MC<br />
+  Great Harem girls<br />
+/-  Character development is uneven amongst characters<br />
+/-  Side characters really only serve one of two purposes<br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10):  The art for Trinity seven is done in a way that I feel really fits the show.  The show is drawn in a sort of darker gradient where the characters don&#039;t look as bright as other magic shows, but more as a more sinister way of expression, reflecting on the dark ideals and powers that the magic in this show really holds.  <br />
<br />
In addition, character design is done relatively well, with the characters looking rather nice from scene to scene with little fluctuation between animated quality.  In addition, the magic circles used in this series are fantastically done with a great amount of detail done to them to make them aesthetically pleasing.  <br />
<br />
Now, Ecchi.  The Ecchi in this show is overdone, in simple sense.  Very often, you will see boobs.  You will see clothes literally disintegrate off of females, and you will see pantsu, sexy poses, and faces that make the characters look like that they&#039;re in heat.  But what makes the ecchi in those show so memorable is the fact that it just looks so natural.  There are no insane dramatic closeups on the characters boobs really any of the ecchi scenes, and because the anime doesn&#039;t go out of its way to completely plaster the screen with breasts, the ecchi honestly doesn&#039;t feel as distracting as it could&#039;ve been.  (Ecchi is still VERY prominent, so beware.)<br />
<br />
As for music, the show hosts a very electronic sounding soundtrack, with its opening being a good example of what the music is going to be like.  It&#039;s a very interesting genre of music to use for the series, and it certainly is quite memorable.  In addition, the show has three separate endings that all use the similar electronic sound to it, whilst having different feels and emotions for each one.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+  Good animation that fits the show&#039;s style<br />
+  Good music<br />
+/-  Cleverly done ecchi  (Can still be distracting if you don&#039;t like ecchi)<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  Yeah, I like this show, maybe too much might I add.  But I digress.  Trinity Seven is a perfect mix for someone like me.  It has plot, it has a great and very memorable main character, and oh so greatly done ecchi.  From the viewpoint someone who basically just watches harem, this is a great show.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this show?<br />
<br />
Yes.  Very much so.  It combined every aspect of what I find in a good show in addition to the idea of harem.  A good first episode to hook in the viewer, a good and easy to follow plot with chronological events, and explanation for at least most of the plot while leaving a little bit of mystery.  The aesthetics were also very well done, and I congratulate the creators for making a show that looked both brooding and fun at the same time.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this show?<br />
<br />
For one thing, it ended.  I want more trinity seven.  Aside from that, the show really didn&#039;t tie up any of the loose ends it made towards the end.  While the anime does follow the manga to the letter, the reality is the fact that, as a downfall, the anime&#039;s story is incomplete due to it following only about 30 or so chapters of the manga.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this show?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a harem lover like me and sick and tired of harem MC&#039;s, or would want to see a show that breaks everything you knew about harem shows, than this show is for you!  Until next time, Magic King Candidate Xadon, OUT!<br />
<br />
Overall Score: 7.85/10

    I&#039;m backwards, so overall first: 8 <br />
<br />
Coming into the show, you should know first off that this is an ecchi/harem/romance comedy with a sometimes serious aura to push the story along when necessary. If fanservice bothers you, Trinity Seven isn&#039;t for you, plain and simple. If that&#039;s part of the fun for you, then prepare to be along on a trip to Sexy Japanese Hogwarts.<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5 (rounds down to 7, more on that later)<br />
Continuing the Harry Potter analogy: MC Arata gets his life turned upside down when he finds out that there is INDEED magic in his world, and it&#039;s about to change his life...

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177257">
        or at least introduce him to some beautiful new lady friends. <br />
The first section feels a bit disjointed, but it&#039;s mostly about character building. From about the halfway point on, it&#039;s pretty easy to tell where the plot is going, but that&#039;s not to say you can&#039;t have fun on the way there. The pacing can be a bit inconsistent, but again, from the midpoint on, it stabilized.<br />
Nothing groundbreaking here, a fairly simple setup of the oft seen &quot;I must rescue the one i love&quot;, but with a couple of twists to keep it fresh. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
There are a couple of moments I found really cool where they used real life photography with animation on top of it- had not seen that before. Otherwise, it just looks like your everyday normal anime. Character art is fine, and the action sequences are well animated, but nothing that will blow you away. (I compare things to Sword Art Online, which i find to be incredible well animated) <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The intro and four (count &#039;em) ending themes are all appropriately energetic and catchy. Not much to say here<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
This is the meat of the show: the characters. You can&#039;t have a harem without breaking a few eggs, right? (woops, wrong idiom) <br />
MC Arata isn&#039;t a blockhead moron. He knows what he wants, just not how to do it. He&#039;s also not afraid to get his hands dirty.<br />
The titular Trinity Seven are a group of (all female) skilled mages who are cream of the crop in their particular area of study. They are varied, and fun, and definitely memorable. They aren&#039;t all introduced at once, so you get some time to know them before they all show up. I had no trouble remembering or telling them all apart, even though it felt like they introduced someone new every episode. The villains are varied, but I felt like they were rushed a little (in terms of development), but it is a 13 episode show, so not much time to work with.<br />
They are all motivated in their own ways, and each one has a reason to be there besides checking off boxes in the harem trope *yawn*. Each member plays their part: they do it with style and a healthy dose of sexiness, or tsundere, your pick. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
One of the absolute best parts of the show (for me, the only person whose opinion matters) was the 4th wall destroying humor. I love self aware comedy, and Trinity Seven delivers with a sledgehammer. Arata is also (from what i understand of harems, this is uncommon) an incorrigible pervert, and thrives in the intensely tense estrogen filled environment into which he&#039;s thrown (sometimes with the help of a friend). I never found that the show took the scandalous content too far- it never devolves into anything porn-like- strictly pg-13.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: <br />
Fun anime, and after going back and reading the manga, it follows it INCREDIBLY closely, which I thought was excellent. Seven Days took a fun little product, added some extra polish and a bit of movement to the tv screen, and here we are. Looking forward to *hopefully* a second season.

    Writing from a shipper&#039;s point of view.<br />
<br />
STORY 9/10<br />
Story is centered around 8 characters. Kasuga, Arata and the trinity seven, mostly Arata&#039;s point of view in my opinion. He&#039;s out on a quest to get his cousin back after he destroys his home town. And his cousin (?) unknowingly doing so though. Because a circle of fate has chosen him to be a demon lord candidate. <br />
<br />
ART 10/10 <br />
The art is is amazing! I love every bit of it, follows the art of the manga exactly. There are only a couple of anime I&#039;ve seen that copy the art style of the manga. So it gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175769">
        a full 10.<br />
<br />
SOUND 10/10<br />
High quality sound, amazing songs. Both OPs are very nice and catchy.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 8/10<br />
My favorite part of the review. At first the characters are all very cliche, but little by little as he gets to know each of them. They change for the better, each and every one of them have there own unique personality that you grow to love in these 12 episode. (Hopefully a season 2 (?) ) But what makes this MC so cool is sometimes he&#039;ll favor one of the girls then develop feelings for another. Kinda typical but he&#039;s acknowledging them one by one.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 10/10<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say here as all I gotta say is you MUST read the manga first and catch up on that. Before watching the anime, otherwise I&#039;m 100% certain your opinion on it will just be a cool MC with a typical harem. The developments in the manga are something of a masterpiece. And the anime does that very well to incorporate that also.<br />
<br />
OVERALL 9/10<br />
As for who he gets with it&#039;s going to be a harem ending. Sadly... but the relations he develops with each one is an adventure on it&#039;s own. If more harems were like this people wouldn&#039;t hate harems so much. Great story, nice characters, amazing sounds, lovely art and that&#039;s all that needs to be said. Everyone has their own opinion so watch this with open arms.<br />

    I don&#039;t typically get as engrossed in harems as much as other series. I find that although I will enjoy them, I&#039;m not fully absorbed in the world and plot. However, there were a couple things about Trinity Seven that just made it feel different.<br />
<br />
First, we have the world in which the series takes place. This is usually one of the things that separates an individual harem from another. Trinity Seven had a unique magic system that was quite different even to someone who has read, watched, or played material from thousands of fantasy worlds. The world details started to interest me, which was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173849">
        first thing that pushed Trinity Seven beyond a simple harem.<br />
<br />
Next, we have the characters. The MC was fundamentally different from the stereotypical harem MC. He isn&#039;t dense in any way I can think of, and therefore would be more easily described as a polar opposite. With the main heroines, you get a nice mix of new and interesting, along with some really well used cliches. More then once, the other heroines poke fun at the tsunderes and clearly emphasize the important personality aspects of each character (&quot;Oh, so I see you have entered dere mode!&quot;). Some of the characters even have complex relations with other characters that allow us to see another side of them. A clear example is seen when Mira explains her relationship with Akio.<br />
<br />
Finally, alongside these key factors, we are also provided with some small extras. Trinity Seven also included one of my favourite OPs of the Fall 2014 season, and some really humourous scenes and quotes that I will remember long after finishing the series.<br />
<br />
Overall, I found this series to be very well done. It stands out in the world of harems, which is quite a feat on it&#039;s own.

    Finally finished all 12 episodes. Now I can review it!<br />
Despite how I enjoyed so very much, I have to give this anime some tough love.<br />
Here we go:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the first few episodes of the anime, it jumped around like nobody&#039;s business! Not as bad or as far as Baccano, so be at ease, but it was there and can confuse viewers. It leaps from and goes back to different points in time. Not like a flashback, but a rearranging of scenes.<br />
Instead of getting from A to B, you see part of B at first, go back to A to explain B, then jump back to B.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175031">
        Those of you who weren&#039;t caught up in the humor of the anime definitely raised an eyebrow.<br />
The start of the story itself was rushed and generic to a degree, but afterwards you can feel how the episodes pretty much felt like fillers before leading up to a final battle and ending of the series. The humor, characters, and ecchi scenes held me over to a degree, but I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head saying things like, &quot;When are we going to get on with the rest of the story?&quot; I hate to say I felt that form an anime I had fun with, but it&#039;s the truth.<br />
The anime can easily be compared to a twinkie with chocolate chips. You&#039;re wading through the fluff and filler, in order to reach the meaningful progression (the chocolate chips).<br />
<br />
Now for the anime played out. Oh god, how can I explain it so you can understand what&#039;s going on.<br />
We start off with our main character, Kasuga, Arata, waking up from a dream foretelling the viewers that he and a mystery girl will struggle to reach one another but can&#039;t. And before the two can grasp each others hands, he wakes up to find himself grasping said mystery girl&#039;s breast. <br />
After the usual morning skit with the mystery girl, Hijiri Kasuga, and showing off how close the two cousins are, they are off to school. Along the way, theirs another mystery girl who warns him and threatens to kill him.<br />
Aside from the death threat, the story seems to be come off as the usual anime in a town. But during the schools break time, our main character notices that the sun is black and misty, and his cousin turned out to be a fake after some seductive and creepy words as she straddled him! At this time, the death threat mystery girl appears, and explains that the world around him was &quot;created&quot; by our main character Arata. Once Arata remembers that the real Hijiri vanished right before him, and the fake Hijiri informs him that the real Hijiri is still alive, he immediately is able to get into a Magic Academy because wants to become a mage so he can learn how to get his cousin back.<br />
That&#039;s the jest of it, I left out some details but nothing you can&#039;t watch for yourself. It turns and twists, but I&#039;ll leave that for you guys to happen upon.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
It combines a 3D environment, with 2D animation. I found this combination charming, and the inside of the Magic Academy to have interesting designs. But in some cases it was puzzling to look at. For example not in all cases but in some cases where the 2D Characters would walk along the 3D ground, it would make the 3D environment seem out of place. I quickly got used to it though, and it throw me off when action scenes came around.<br />
The characters design seemed to try and give a unique look to people, but the people looked d a bit off at first. Such as an oval shape glare at the bottom of the eyes of all characters. It made me think that quite a few people were watery or teary eyed, but that was just part of the design.<br />
I know how hard it is to apply something new to anime in regard to design, as viewers may want more of the same, so I commend the series for approaching art in its own way.<br />
The animation never seemed to miss a beat. It surprisingly kept up with the frames of the opening themes animation. Great detail and attention their.<br />
Surprisingly enough, the characters who were well endowed didn&#039;t have breasts, butts, or legs shining through clothing, or eating the clothing. The shining was saved and given in doses along side fanservice. I commend any anime who knows when to hold back on everything being oiled up for the sake of eye candy.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
<br />
I loved the opening theme, but it took me sometime to get used to the closing themes. It&#039;s all good though, great choices in songs.<br />
The regular music that played throughout the anime was refreshing and imersing. It had tracks that hinted techno, orchestra/piano/stringed instruments, or just a combination of the two. And I&#039;m a sucker for classical music that plays well with animation.<br />
It had interesting and cool sound effects for spells being cased and used, and great voice acting from memorable voices. I think I recognized Arata&#039;s voice actor as the same person who played as Kirito from SAO.<br />
With pleasant surprises every, and good immersion, this anime isn&#039;t lacking in sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
<br />
<br />
The first thing I noticed, is how our main character is very lively. He copes well with just about all situations and jokes from the characters around him, his voice actor made him instantly loveable and memorable. Just like the headmaster of the academy.<br />
Not all the girls are fodder that fall in love for the main character after an episode or three, they have their own personalities, opinions, and reactions to the main character! I was floored by this, but not so much to not realize how generic some of them were, ok?<br />
It&#039;s hard to not call them generic when there&#039;s the easily embarrassed sex symbol, the monotone girl who claims the main character as her husband, the big breasted Loli who claims the main character as her Onii-san, the TWINS with one who acts like the biggest fan/journalist and one showing off her tits and her intentions in the most sexual way she can, and the girl who&#039;s judgmental of the main character until she&#039;s forced to get to know him.<br />
The only unique girls I came across, was the rare rough neck girl who&#039;s tall and strong enough to break walls, who makes jokes, and doesn&#039;t act seductively AT ALL.<br />
And the seductive ninja girl who makes sexy jokes with only a few of the main girls, and the main character.<br />
But with all this said, these characters make the anime fun and rewatchable.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
<br />
<br />
There&#039;s hardly anything I didn&#039;t enjoy from the anime.<br />
<br />
The bold main character who&#039;s a refreshing breeze in this anime world led by either either cry babies, accidental perverts who get their butts kicked left and right, or dopey goof-balls.<br />
A harem that feels alive, and not slaves to the plot.<br />
The fanservice, and action.<br />
It&#039;s like an abridged parody, how hilarious this anime is.<br />
But how generic, and lacking it is when it comes to story progression, is a painful blister that hurts when touched. Even if it only has 12 episodes to introduce 7 main characters to a MAIN-main character.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
<br />
With tough love, I give Trinity Seven:<br />
A 6 out of 10.<br />
It&#039;s a gosh darn waste! The story doesn&#039;t suck, it&#039;s just the fluff standing between me and meaningful story progression.<br />
&quot;I would get you there, but let&#039;s go here and work our way to where you want to be.&quot; &quot;I&#039;ll give you the information you&#039;re looking for, but... listen to me sing on stage, then buy me a drink.&quot;<br />
I don&#039;t like having to wait for the story to continue. I had a wonderful time getting to where I needed to be over time instead of just getting their quickly, I love your song and I don&#039;t mind buying you a drink, but I can only sit and take so many detours and listen to so many songs so many times before it feels like I&#039;m playing a waiting game.<br />
Maybe the series needed to save up in order to make a 24 episode series. Because it&#039;s not like I want things taken out of the anime. Instead, I wanted story progression added into it. Balance out the chocolate chips with the fluff and cream. Make a kick butt twinkie anime. A twinkie anime that&#039;s made with everything enriched, and not with something set aside to hail the mindless hordes only in it for the fanservice.<br />
That said, this anime is a good buy. Granted the makers look up feed back, and improve any other work they put out. I&#039;d love to go to find other people and talk about the anime, or look up fan art. Because the enjoyment is there, the anticipation is there, but not the overall anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
And until it is, let&#039;s meet up at another review.

    This was my first &quot;harem&quot; anime, even though some people are saying it&#039;s not much of a harem anime. I&#039;ve never really been interested in harems, but this show had me intrigued. The reason i originally started watching it is because of the art style. It&#039;s very unique and i thought it looked pretty awesome. The plot of the story is pretty good, although not great. The show seems to focus on the character interactions more than the actual plot. I like the characters, especially Arata, seeing as he takes charge and isn&#039;t afraid to do what he wants. He&#039;s pervy and there&#039;s a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174319">
        of fan service throughout the series. You have some of the typical anime characters like the tsundere and the loli. The fight scenes are good, better than i expected. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed they make a season two.

    I thank myself for choosing this anime. Trinity Seven looked unfamiliar and not-so interesting for me to watch at first, and also, I hadn&#039;t known much about the studio producing the anime, Seven Arcs. But I was impressed by what it has shown for the past 12 weeks.<br />
<br />
Looking at the poster, you would known that the anime is going to be a harem in a magic school. While we already encountered many magic (and sometimes having a lot of female characters in the cast) anime, this is definitely going to stand out among the rest this year. The story started in a typical day for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174049">
        Arata, living with his childhood friend Hijiri. With the sudden appearance of a magician, later a while, he found out something weird. He learnt that the town they lived was destroyed by a phenomenon and so a grimorie given by Hijiri before disappearing reconstructed it. The magician, Lilith, then invites him to Royal Biblia Academy where he has a goal to save Hijiri. But to do, he has to become a demon lord and gather the Trinity Seven.<br />
<br />
Sure, big words and seemingly generic story. But the way the anime executes the setting is great. Observing the timeline of this story is like piecing to make a puzzle. As the story progresses, more characters are introduced and usually they take their time in the episode to explain the audience about themselves and perhaps about this magic they possess. Yet again, it has a lot of explanation which you can either get confused of or forget along the way. Eventually, you can get some idea of it unless you are watching it for the fan-service. Each mage has magic based on their thema (theme) and basically they are different types of magic spells to their own desire.<br />
<br />
How the story closes leaves a sweet feeling. I really don&#039;t know how the story can continue, since I felt that everything is so clear for me already.<br />
<br />
Cramming many different types of genres into one story can sometimes be a trainwreck. Trinity Seven tries to balance several of them - action, comedy, ecchi, fantasy, romance and harem. That&#039;s a lot. The comedy is funny at times through characters&#039; interaction. There&#039;s some action included with battles between the opponents. The fan-service is definitely too much and sometimes repetitive, and it isn&#039;t as much as I expected when watching the first episode. The romance and harem aspects aren&#039;t fully explored, but there are crushes towards Arata from the characters. Indeed, some relationships develop along the way. In the end, as you can see, it&#039;s really hard to maintain, but I don&#039;t think this has ruined the anime at all. Of course, this depends on whether you like these genres, or you expected them.<br />
<br />
The Trinity Seven team is an interesting set of characters. It takes time to introduce them one by one and I say that I&#039;m satisfied how the story introduces the characters well with whatever character they have in themselves. I heard that they are based of the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, although I don&#039;t recall it being mentioned in the anime. Still, it is a nice linkage.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s true to say that you can expect some harem tropes in them. And unfortunately the anime didn&#039;t go perfectly in this section. Sure, I said they are an interesting bunch, but that depends on themselves. The girls are interesting because of how they act, but a very few has good development because of the interactions between themselves and Arata. Sometimes, a few of the them looked left out from the rest. But nevertheless, some of the characters also display some different emotions too.<br />
<br />
As for Arata himself, I must give extra points for his attitude. Never-ever dense, this main character knows how to interact, be it in a fan-service or an intense battle situation. From start to end, he knows what he wanted and how to achieve it. Thanks to the girls that helped along the way, he has a lovely development I like to see. Sure, he has his cute side as well - once in a while he feels embarrassed, and as well as having some deep thoughts over things like Hijiri.<br />
<br />
The opponents against the Trinity Seven are cool but doesn&#039;t have a wide character and development, possibly due to the time of their introduction. <br />
<br />
Trinity Seven&#039;s art isn&#039;t quite unique. The colour palette used for everything looks dull in some places. While some sceneries look great, the others look plain and boring. It is due to the fact that there&#039;s not much lively atmosphere in many of these sceneries. There are CGI used in some interior sceneries for the movement of the camera panning, and I feel it feels nice with the 2D moving animation most of the time. The visual effects are great. Magic circles, sparks flying and explosions feel so well-done. Fighting animation seems fair enough, but yet again there&#039;s not really much fight scenes that involve punching. Some battles have this nice impact that leaves a nice finish.<br />
The character designs are weirdly good. Their body shapes are fine but I feel that the character designs in the manga looked better, maybe because of more realistic details. Some faces might look weird but you will get used to it soon. The facial expressions vary and even from a multi-genre anime, I like how they show the feelings of the characters, either comedic or not.<br />
<br />
ZAQ decides to sing another single. If you know her by now, most of the songs have a different feel and style. Seven Doors has an epic rock feel that gets into the groove of Trinity Seven, along with her great voice that matches along the instrumental. It&#039;s definitely one that can stand out from the rest of openings in this season. Meanwhile, the anime has four songs of different styles as well. Each are sung by a pair of voice actresses that their characters are well-related. Overall, I enjoyed all but one but I love to see a nice variety of this.<br />
<br />
The background music has a nice take over the battle scenes, generating some hype and action that blends well. Other scenes are fine as well. Besides, its main genre focus is techno (electronic) music. The voice acting is done well, it helps to match whatever the character is acting or saying. I love to see some voice actresses acting out of their usual acting. One example is Yumi that voices Takane from iDOLM@STER, voices Lilith. And we all know who voiced Arata. Yoshitsugu is very famous and voiced many different characters, but it&#039;s good that he keeps it to Arata&#039;s character for the anime.<br />
<br />
I really can&#039;t say if this is a recommendation for everyone, but I personally enjoyed whatever Trinity Seven has offered. There may have been a lot of explanation to go through or maybe you can&#039;t stand a lot of fan-service, but I guess I&#039;m happy to see that this generic setting is executed well.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t mind continuing the manga after the anime, and I don&#039;t know if we&#039;re getting a second season or not. There&#039;s still an OVA, so it&#039;s worth catching it for a fix of never-dense main character with his interestingly weird harem.

    Trinity Seven is a plot-heavy action/magic based show, it&#039;s definitely a bit of a thrill ride, though, it has to include mammoth amounts of contextual information and scene setting, just you that you know what&#039;s going on - and even then, the fantasy details can be bit confusing.<br />
<br />
The show is quite 2-faced, as can be observed from its ability to go from serious plot-related events, to... ecchi. While at the start, i felt this just got in the way, it did (unfortunately) turn out to be slightly relevant during some later episodes.<br />
<br />
Still i WOULDN&#039;T say that &quot;it&#039;s all about Harem&quot;, as there really is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174081">
        serious story to be told. I loved the plot twists, the suspense, and the realizations. Though, it&#039;s all presented in an &quot;immediate scope&quot; - meaning that there&#039;s no time for any additional character development, or details that could make it easier to become better acquainted with the Trinity Seven. <br />
It seems that at times, particularly near the start - they tried to rectify this, with a slower pace: which did help induce a definite sense of wonder and mystery when i begun watching.<br />
<br />
Though, with the added pressure of only 12 episodes to tell a story worthy of a much larger anime title, like a kid drawing &quot;bubble letters&quot;, it seemed that after the half way mark, they were running out of space, and so a significant amount of content had to be lost in order to convey the bare bones of the story.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re planning to watch as a thriller, then this really does do action, suspense, AND PLOT TWISTS!<br />
 - rather well. Though, those of you looking for something with more vividness may want to look elsewhere.<br />
<br />

    TLDR: Generic magic fantasy story with a harem and fan service<br />
<br />
Trinity seven&#039;s story was quite confusing and boring. It started off for a few episodes where I didn&#039;t know what was happening because I didn&#039;t care. T7&#039;s premise was generic fantasy where our MC finds power and has to save the world. Where it is different is he has a harem and you can&#039;t really tell what he&#039;s trying to save, except for his cousin. The magic system was original, but uninteresting, and the names for everything are the generic fantasy names that you see in many pieces. You have your Norse, Biblical, and other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173881">
        mythological names that you see everywhere. Which is fine, usually; however, after so many pieces of entertainment have used it, original concepts go a long way. 3/10<br />
<br />
Animation quality is a bit above average for today&#039;s standard. It excels during fights and is decent the rest of the time. There is a lot of fanservice. MC is a &quot;lucky pervert&quot; and see&#039;s, touches, and fantasizes about all of the girls&#039; boobs. You can&#039;t go an episode without characters awkwardly falling on top of each other; either exposing their crotch or boobs. 7/10<br />
<br />
Sound quality is above average. The OP was really catchy and the ED&#039;s were ok. The BGM was very fitting for each scene and I noticed it a lot of the time. I found it exceptional. 8/10<br />
<br />
The characters were your run of the mill Tsundere, Kuudere, Dandere, etc. Liese best girl, don&#039;t you deny that. Each and every girl was nice to look at ;) and had somethings that were interesting about them. My only complaint was the shit MC who looks so very stupid. Every time I look at Arata, he seems a bit off, somehow. Also, he is  quite the average pervert and isn&#039;t really interesting. He has his moments, but wasn&#039;t a good MC. Characters are a bit too generic, overall, so 4/10 seems appropriate. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment for this skyrocketed about halfway through the series. This turned from a 3/10, overall to a 7/10 over the course of the second half. <br />
<br />
In the end, T7 isn&#039;t spectacular. It was fun to watch, but hard to get into. I wasn&#039;t expecting much going in; nevertheless, after watching the show, I was still thoroughly entertained. 54/100

    The first view I got when I checked it out was that it would be very awesome due to the superpowers and a good story. But after completing it, I have to say I&#039;m quite disappointed. So, let&#039;s break it down and complete it quickly.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10:<br />
A boy who has no knowledge about magic suddenly becomes one of the most powerful mages, a demon lord candidate. And he tries to get on the good side of the 7 strongest mages; the Trinity Seven, who are all girls in order to get back his cousin who disappeared due to some magic (breakdown phenomenon).<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
What&#039;s wrong with those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174745">
        eyes? Looks like everyone has a cold. Apart from the eyes, the rest seems to be quite good. Yeah, so it&#039;s got good animation and character design.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10:<br />
The protagonist is an ultra pervert whose most powerful magic is ripping apart everyone&#039;s clothes. Other than that, the trinity seven are quite good. They don&#039;t go into the depth of each character, just their powers and there affection for the perverted demon lord aka the protagonist.The bad guys, well, they just pop out of nowhere and the last 2 episodes deal with the real antagonist&#039;s of the series. And what&#039;s their story, sorry, but that&#039;s not told.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10:<br />
This series starts out quite good but soon I was just watching it to complete it. Power ups come in an instant. One time he doesn&#039;t know a thing, the next episode, he&#039;s kicking major butt and has become a demon lord. <br />
<br />
The series has a complete ending but many things are still left untold and the main purpose of the protagonist is still to be achieved. But looking at this series, I doubt it would get a sequel.<br />
<br />
Overall rank: 7/10 (seems good for an anime with 7 in it&#039;s name)<br />

    Typical high school nonsense story. Male protagonist gets all the girls. Story is kind of meh, depending on your taste.<br />
<br />
Unlike in other ecchi harem anime&#039;s with a male lead, this one has a very good male character. He isn&#039;t dumb as a sack of bricks, is perverted and very honest about it and often jokes about it when in an embarrassing situation which IMO is a MAJOR + that this kind of genre seems to lack. <br />
<br />
There is lot of ecchi, lot of &quot;accidental&quot; boobs touching but its of a different caliber than in other anime. Arata&#039;s jokes and overall attitude towards being a pervert

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181621">
        are refreshing rather than apologetic like in other anime.<br />
<br />
I like the art, sound and animation but have seen better. Still this to me is a &quot;normal&quot; anime animations and art and I don&#039;t know how to explain it better.<br />
<br />
I have to say that this anime is my 2nd best anime watched of this genre.<br />
I really enjoyed it and would love another session.<br />
<br />
I recommend it highly to those interested in this genre.
