    I am a total ecchi-enthusiast, so keep in mind I might be a little in love with this show when writing my review. <br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
Haha. Most people would probably shrug this show off as &quot;Are you serious?&quot; or &quot;Wow, what perverts&quot;, as the synapsis makes it seem like Yamada is a total slut and that all you&#039;ll get is very intense fanservice for 12 episodes. Think KissxSis or Rosario+Vampire-esque. But B Gata H Kei is not purely fanservice, there is actually a very funny story, and when there is fanservice it&#039;s not that trashy, are-you-kidding-me kind. A girl who thinks her vagina looks weird and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27290">
        wants 100 sex friends? Sounds good to me. But there is so much more to B Gata H Kei. A girl&#039;s quest to have sex filled with hilarious dialogue and outrageous situations. Ecchi comedy at its finest.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is pretty good. Yamada and others are well drawn and cute and backgrounds and scenery (like Kanejou&#039;s house) can be very pretty. Kosuda definitely fits the generic high school male description, and this is very refreshing in contrast to the majority of &quot;normal&quot; anime males with six packs, spikey blonde hair, etc. Boobs can be a bit huge in this show, but it&#039;s not disgusting and trashy because of B Gata H Kei&#039;s comedic element.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The show has a decent amount of popular seiyuu including Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui as Yamada and Takeshita, respectively, so sound is nice and the voice acting isn&#039;t forced and unbelievable or anything. The OP and ED are cute to me, and will probably be cute to you too if you&#039;re a Yukarin fan :). The background music isn&#039;t made up of mellifluous symphonies or anything TENMON-esque, but it gets the job done and isn&#039;t annoying or anything. The random &quot;B Gata H Kei~&quot; is cute. ^^<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
YAMADA. I love Yamada so much, she&#039;d get a 10/10 from me. Yamada is so entertaining, and her sorta tsuntsun side, though cliche, can make episodes very funny. The best part about Yamada is that she&#039;s daring, as you&#039;ll see if you watch the show. And let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s not often that you have a sex-obsessed female character in anime.<br />
Kosuda can also have his awesome moments, though he usually fits the typical high school male role that he&#039;s supposed to fit (which is a good thing). Other characters like Takeshita, Kanejou, and Miyano often add to the comedic relief of the show and are valuable aspects to this show&#039;s comedy. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: &gt;9000<br />
I wish I could give this show an infinity in enjoyment, because that&#039;s what really makes this show a 10/10, the only 10/10 I&#039;ve ever given, for me. I remember watching every episode of this show and not wanting it to end. This show is hilarious and I enjoyed it to the fullest extent. Today, 6/18/10, I finished the series and I sort of wanted to cry, because there&#039;d be no more of this show to entertain me on a weekly basis. ): The comedy in this show is amazing, though it can still manage to be serious and/or erotic. <br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei is an amazing watch if you just want to enjoy yourself and don&#039;t mind a little ecchi. If you&#039;re an ecchi-enthusiast like I am, I highly recommend this show, as it is probably the best, and seriously the classiest ecchi I&#039;ve ever seen. I know classy ecchi sounds a little bit strange, but I promise you, this is not a Rosario + Vampire kind of ecchi with panty shots galore, but the fanservice is there where it&#039;s supposed to be, the comedy balances it out so it&#039;s not gratuitous. <br />
<br />
If you love ecchi and comedy, you&#039;ll surely love B Gata H Kei~!

Oh my Lord. Where to start with this anime... I was just browsing through My Anime List, just adding new animes to my &quot;Summer Watch List&quot;, and stumbled upon this. Added it to the list, 2 weeks later, a friend of mine told me that he had watched this and told me he liked it a lot. So, this was the first anime I watched over the entire summer with the exception of Attack on Titan and Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicals. My first impression, &quot;What the f*ck did I just watch...?&quot; For those of you who have seen it as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102133">
        well, you were all thinking the same thing, I know you did. It&#039;s one of those romcoms for adults, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo, only this show focuses on one thing, Sex. Without further ado, let&#039;s get this review started, shall we?<br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei, has a unique story, if you can actually call it that. It focuses on our main protagonist, Yamada. She&#039;s the most beautiful girl at her school, all the guys can&#039;t help but fall for her. Her goal is to have 100 Friends with Benefits, or Sex Buddies as she calls it. Strange, huh? 15 years old and the only thing she can think of is sex. For a teenage boy, yes, I can imagine that, but you&#039;d never guess that&#039;s all a girl would think about that stuff. Anyways, she wants her first time to be with a cherry boy (AKA a virgin). She happens to find a boy by the name of Kosuda, an obvious cherry boy judging from the way he acts around her. Later, she finds out he goes to her school. And he sits right next to her. Throughout the show, Yamada tries to get Kosuda to have sex with her, however he can be dense at times, and not even know what she&#039;s trying to do, and you&#039;d think flashing him would give him some kind of clue... as the story starts progressing, there are other characters that come into the show, giving them something else to present to the audience, so as an overall story, in terms of uniqueness, it&#039;s grade A. In terms of having an actual story, it&#039;s grade Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei was brought to you by the studio who produced/co-produced animes such as Aria, DearS, Boys Be..., and Kaleido Star. For their previous animes, the art style is actually fairly well done in my opinion. The characters are pretty casual in terms of uniqueness, but they are drawn with such precision and detail that I really liked it. The only problem I had was all the sparkles around the Kanejou Siblings... what the hell are they, Vampires? What, are they related to the cast of Twilight?<br />
<br />
I watched both the English Dub and Sub version of B Gata H Kei. Overall, I prefer the sub. I won&#039;t lie, I&#039;m Brittney Karbowski&#039;s biggest fan ever. No joke, but she didn&#039;t suit the role of Yamada. In my opinion, Yamada is a littttle bit... of a bitch. That is not something Brittney is good at. Actually, she did a really good job as Yamada, but I hated hearing such a beautiful actress play the role of a skank. It was sad. The other voice actors and actresses I had no problems with, I loved Alexis Tipton as Yamada&#039;s Sex Deity, and Greg Aryes as Kosuda&#039;s Sex Deity, and Cherami Leigh as Miharu. Those were my favorite characters. Everyone in the Japanese Dub did an awesome job though, they matched up to their characters with perfection and professionalism.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not often that the character I hate most in an anime is the main character, I think the only other protagonist I hated was Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion... but come on, we all hated him. But I couldn&#039;t stand Yamada. I think it was a mixture of her slut-like personality and her overall meanness that made he hate her so much... sure she was pretty in some scenes, but whenever she opened her mouth, I instantly knew something about sex was gonna come out. Kosuda was actually the one person in B Gata H Kei that I could relate to in some way. He&#039;s super shy around girls, he doesn&#039;t understand them that much, but he&#039;s an overall nice guy. I have most of the same problems as him, so I liked him a lot. I knew what he was feeling and stuff. Next are the Deities. Yamada&#039;s Deity was hilarious, her comments and scene change lines were all awesome. Kosuda&#039;s Deity didn&#039;t have many moments in the show, except whenever Kosuda would get a little excited (if you know what I mean). He was more of a censorship then a character... and then we have Miharu, Yamada&#039;s best friend. She is somehow able to handle being friends with Yamada, which I don&#039;t know how, but she gives advice and can be a good friend a lot of the time. And lastly... Kyoka, or should I say Miss Vampire Queen. She&#039;s gorgeous, but she has the same personality as Yamada, only sex isn&#039;t the only thing she ever thinks about... also she sparkles 24/7.<br />
<br />
I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started B Gata H Kei, but I can say that it was a fun watch. It had a lot of good humor in it, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo like I said before, and I enjoyed the crap out of that one. It had romance throughout the entire show, but it was more of a requited love sadly. The ending came a little too sudden, I feel like this could have been a 24 episode anime if they decided to, but overall it was a good anime. I recommend it to those who love echii, but if you hate sexual jokes and innuendos, by all means, don&#039;t watch this. If you don&#039;t mind that, this is a must watch.

    Normally I stay very, VERY clear from ecchi-type anime. I cannot stand harem shit, I can&#039;t do the gross sexism and fanservice grossness, and I really don&#039;t have the patience to sit through hours upon hours of &quot;will they? won&#039;t they? lol of course not.&quot; When a good friend of mine recommended it to me I was extremely skeptical, but once I started the first episode I was immediately hooked. <br />
<br />
The main character is practically a carbon copy of myself at 15 - so incredibly interested in having sex, but equally awkward about actually making it happen. I related to her so much, and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187610">
        really believe this is because the author is a (talented) woman; she is really able to get into the hormone-addled mind of a curious but inexperienced teenage girl. I found myself cheering her on from the very beginning and was actually holding my breath when things got interesting. The other characters are cute and just about everyone gets a good amount of actual development, which is not what I was expecting from a show like this. <br />
<br />
Other than the premise and characters though, a lot of aspects fell short. The music was forgettable, the animation was pretty standard, etc. The humor was just a bit repetitive, but surprisingly did get a few out-loud laughs from me. The ending was a disappointment, since there was no real &quot;conclusion&quot; to speak of - I had to turn to the manga (starting around chapter 260) for closure. <br />
<br />
I watched the English dub, and the voice acting was pretty good! Normally I stick pretty exclusively to subs, but having watched parts of this both ways, I can pretty safely say that the jokes translated much better when used with American slang. <br />
<br />
Yamada and her little sex goddess character really what made this show special, though. I wasn&#039;t expecting to connect so much with her or to root for a character every step of the way, so I was very pleasantly surprised to see a female lead who was just as outspoken about sex as I was at her age. Although I may not rewatch this, if any additional content is made, I will be very eager to see it!

       This anime really inspired me to join the fun on this community.<br />
I know guys have imagined it, a hot girl wanting you while you&#039;re just an average nobody. I can&#039;t really relate to that since I don&#039;t have the luck that Takashi Kosuda has in this series.<br />
<br />
   Honestly, only watch this if you have a sense of perversion because the entire thing is literally all about sex, but thats whats nice about it. I would love to enjoy this anime after seeing something heartbreaking like Clannad and its after story.<br />
<br />
   The whole I want to have 100 &quot;partners&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27640">
        in my lifetime makes you think its a hentai, but in actuality its just a innocent anime about high school kids discovering about sex. I believe every high school kid has dreamed about the day where they finally get to discover another person&#039;s body. Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are certainly fan service elements in this but I feel that this is a worthy anime for a season 2 or perhaps an OVA.<br />
<br />
  This anime is amazingly cheery and fun. You will never get sad since its an optimistic anime filled with jokes, (that aren&#039;t outdated) even if half of them have something sex related to it. <br />
<br />
 What I didn&#039;t like about this anime is that how undetailed the supporting characters were and that its censored. I also did not like how short it was (and that it was censored.) I feel that another season is a must for B Gata H Kei but this time with improvements. I want them to go in depth with their story line (and did I mention how it was censored?)<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d give this a 7, its not a MUST see but you&#039;d be happy if you did.<br />
<br />
PS. ANOTHER SEASON WOULD BE AMAZING. did i mention the censoring?

    If there is any show that defines wasted potential, it’s B Gata H Kei. What started as a possible lighthearted gender flipped rendition of School Days ended up a pedestrian school comedy that was only saved by a somewhat fresh sense of humor and constant victimization of the lead and her love interest. <br />
<br />
Our story follows Yamada, first name conspicuously absent throughout the whole affair, on her quest to have sex with one hundred males by the end of high school. Everything seems in the bag for her: She’s beautiful, smart; every guy in school wants her. The problem is, she’s too self conscious about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39697">
        her lady bits to make a move. <br />
<br />
So rather than aiming for somebody with sexual experience, she ends up starting with the lowest rung in class that she can imagine: A random boy she finds in a bookstore who looks as average and virgin-like as possible named Kosuda. And thus starts a series of blunders in a quest to get him to have sex with her, while only paying lip service to her goal stated early on. <br />
<br />
Helping her on her way is Yamada’s own Ero-God, a chibi-fied character resembling her in every way that has a swarthy moustache. The problem is, due to Yamada’s impulsive waffling, Ero-God does much more berating than assisting or praising.<br />
<br />
On the way, opposition is offered from Kosuda’s introverted and painfully clumsy childhood friend, and the standard exchange student who wants nothing more than to crush Yamada for besting her in a beauty contest. Romantic hijinks ensue, sex nearly happens more than once, and more than a few bones end up broken as a result of Yamada’s own cluelessness. <br />
<br />
First, let’s get the good points out of the way. Yamada is the best example of a horny ecchi male lead in a woman’s body. Except rather than taking the Maria Holic route of making her fantasize for half the damn episode, Yamada’s actually proactive enough to seek sex on her own, even if she’s too scared to see it through ‘til the end. <br />
<br />
That can hardly be faulted against her though, with her endeavoring to screw a hundred guys by the end of her high school career without having even been in a relationship before. The tsundere pretense that she puts up helps to characterize her as somebody who has faith in her attractiveness, but not necessarily her ability to deal with the opposite sex in a lustful way.<br />
<br />
While I wouldn’t call the comedy exceptionally unique and stellar, it’s well implemented enough to make up for the many faults that plague the series throughout. While Kosuda isn’t anybody with a vibrant personality, he does well in representing sexually frustrated, yet cautious youth. He doesn’t act like he’s above having sex, yet he isn’t fully comfortable with it either, creating a believable sense of awkwardness. Strangely enough, by the end he becomes the most endearing character, putting up with the harmful antics of Yamada much more than would be thought humanly possible.<br />
<br />
Together, the two form the perfect combination: Both have implacable sex drives, no experience in relieving their libidos, and interest in the other that gets muddled amidst the endless moments of miscommunication that occur. It’s surprisingly deep, surprisingly realistic characterization that isn’t common in any media, and that’s a treat in itself. <br />
<br />
However, even with that praise, I’d hesitate to call this a great, or even a good anime. Picture any sort of environment for your standard dull romantic comedy (Beach, forest, school), and B Gata H Kei goes there. It can be argued that this is subversion, but it stands that Yamada and Kosuda do everything that couples do in these kinds of anime, and many of the same jokes are used, albeit with less focus on the male’s point of view. <br />
<br />
Everything that isn’t related to the two main characters is painfully ordinary. The animation is average at best, the soundtrack is mostly the same, and the plot consistently derails itself for the sake of character development. I wouldn’t say this is a bad thing, but it’s all about expectations. I came in expecting a show about a girl who wanted to have sex with a bevy of males by the end of her senior year, not her struggling to woo just one. <br />
<br />
In an unexpected turn of events, a powerful message is brought to light: A satisfying romance can be had without sex early on. The two could only accept each other in a carnal fashion once they were sure that the other would reciprocate in kind, and would give back with feeling. These are two people insecure with themselves, only secure in the knowledge that the other isn’t confident sexually. <br />
<br />
In the end though, it’s only the characters that changed in the school comedy setup, not the actions. The characters went through the motions until the very end, when their feelings were fully realized and ready to be unleashed in a wave of passion. It’s almost frustrating to watch before this, seeing Yamada screw up in her seduction and Kosuda struggle in understanding why she acts like she does.<br />
<br />
I mentioned missed potential earlier, and B Gata H Kei had it. What could’ve been a decent look into the mind of a sexually aware yet totally clueless girl on a quest to fully realize herself on a primeval level degenerated quickly into what I mentioned above: A typical comedy that’s only saved by the surprisingly interesting and fleshed out, if not terribly original characters.<br />
<br />
 I understand that this was to appeal to a broader audience, but there’s a demerit if I ever saw one for completely screwing over what could’ve been the intriguing execution of a rare premise.<br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei is perfectly fine, and is a hell of a lot more memorable than many similar series out there. Oddly enough, it’s probably one of the more realistic depictions of romance in anime, and just how awkward it really is when communicated improperly. If you can get past the false premise, occasionally boring episode plots and standard… well, everything else, B Gata H Kei has plenty to offer on a level of greater depth than you’d think. Just don’t expect to be blown away. <br />

    There is a sea of ecchi anime with horny and socially awkward male leads. Heck, it is easy to name a dozen from the top of your head, needless to say the ecchi market gets pretty monotonous... But what if a show centered  around a pervert girl instead? Well, that is exactly what B Gata H Kei decides to do. The result is no better than any number of ecchi titles that have the normal pervert male protagonist.<br />
<br />
The show follows Yamada, an extremely attractive and sex obsessed girl, on her quest to get a hundred sex buddies during her time in high school. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43089">
        problem is, despite being obsessed with sex, Yamada is naive when it comes down to the act, and self-continuous because she is a virgin; she is determined to have her first time with a fellow virgin. Enter Takashi Kosuda, an average high school guy, who just so happens to be a virgin. Of course its not going to be easy for Yamada, because Kosuda&#039;s a pretty dense fellow... *Sigh* What can be said about this premise; it&#039;s pretty dumb. To be fair, it is different (how many other shows can you name that follow a female lead as perverted as Yamada?), but outside of the weird role-reversal, B Gata H Kei does little to distinguish itself from its ecchi brethren.<br />
<br />
The way the plot progresses is typical for this kind of show. Yamada meets Kosuda and does something that sanctimoniously grabs his attention and repels him from her... then it turns out that they are in the same class in school (of course) giving Yamada ample opportunity to seduce/ sexually harass Kotsuda; awkward moments and half-baked attempts to get laid ensue. Really, there is so little to say about the plot execution here, it is just bland, tired, and uninteresting. It doesn&#039;t help that the show is by nature, shallow and superficial... there really is no intensive to follow what is happening on screen, it&#039;s all sex jokes or some very forced attempts to build a relationship between its two leads.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are a collection of one-off stereotypes, and that&#039;s about all. Pretty much every character is doomed to one (or two, if we&#039;re lucky) repeating character trait that defines them. Kosuda is a bland and boring as a lead character gets, and spends all his screen time either misinterpreting Yamada&#039;s intentions or getting aroused thinking about her. The other characters are just as bad, consisting of Kosuda&#039;s childhood friend, who of course has a crush on him; Yamada&#039;s much more mature friend, who&#039;s only function is to make snark comments; Yamada&#039;s rival, who actually wants to lose her virginity to her brother (of course they would include an incest character)... and too many other poorly written characters to even count. Then there is our leading lady Yamada, who isn&#039;t a typical female lead, but her character can be summed up in a few of words: she wants to have sex, but is too timid... THAT&#039;S ALL.<br />
<br />
To say that the show has absolutely no redeeming qualities, though, is a lie. Admittedly, the show can be funny. Yamada&#039;s sex fantasies aren&#039;t always grating and can generate a few laughs every now and then; the same goes for Kosuda&#039;s being clueless. There are gags that work, for no other reason than they are silly or awkward. Even with this though, the series comedy can&#039;t be completely congratulated because it is used to death; yeah, if you&#039;re looking for a variety of humor, you won&#039;t find it here, nothing but crass sex jokes and snark comments. The second thing the show has going for it is the sex appeal, and yeah, it manages to that well. The show actually gets away with quite a bit... it is essentially like watching censored porn; while that doesn&#039;t sound too appealing, the show pulls it off with some very descriptive dialogue and well placed demon censor bars or other conveniently placed objects. When that&#039;s the best thing that can be said about a show, you know your in trouble.<br />
<br />
Visually, B Gata H Kei is generally underwhelming. The character designs are generic and forgettable, only appealing if you are in love with anime art style regardless of quality. Allegedly, Yamada is an extremely attractive girl, but honestly she&#039;s not better or worse looking than any of the other girls in her school. Backgrounds are stale, with maybe the exception of scenes in love hotels or make-out spots, even then it is nothing to write home about. The only thing that stands out visually are the demon censor bars and barely concealed fan-service. The show is not impressive in the sound department either, if anything it is less memorable. Its not bad but it is the usual pop music that is used all too often in slice-of-life anime. Really, if you don&#039;t have voyeuristic tendencies then B Gata H Kei&#039;s technical merits will do nothing for you (though it would be odd that you are even watching an ecchi in that case).<br />
<br />
In the end, B Gata H Kei seems like a show that just wants to have fun, but ends up rather repulsive instead. Sure, something like this would never be sophistic or profound, but this hardly passes as cheap entertainment. The characters are as flat and plastic as they come, and the show doesn&#039;t even look good. Even if you are simply looking for some raunchy silliness, there are many other ecchi titles that are much more worth your time than this.<br />

    I&#039;d like to start off by saying that this show was very unique to me. The main character Yamada reminded me so much of Nana Komatsu from the anime NANA. Hyperactive, sex addict, guy crazy, and has a friend that gives her good advice.<br />
I really liked the energy and excitement of the story, that and the interesting characters are what gave me a &quot;good&quot; impression of it. One thing I really did like and really stands out in this show is that it is not completely over the top. Most shows with the genre ecchi, school, and romance really overdo it with the nudity and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204241">
        fan service whenever they can. B.H.K was kind of like screw that nudity and fan service stuff, well give the viewers excitement and drama. The art was pretty decent for it&#039;s time, although it&#039;s nothing that really stands out. Overall I think this show is very good! and well planned out.

    Upon reading the synopsis and seeing &quot;her dream was to have casual sex with 100 men,&quot; my mind went blank. I guess my testosterone levels were high at the time because by the time I knew it the whole anime was downloaded on my computer and the first episode was rolling.<br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei is a very &quot;sexually humored&quot; driven anime, I like it. Although this looks like a fan service anime it wasn&#039;t as flashy as say &quot;Rosario + Vampire&quot; or &quot;Ladies vs Butlers&quot; with up skirt galore every 5 secs. What really made this anime interesting is the different points of view it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review77751">
        shows, seeing what each character is thinking really allows you to empathize with the characters and make it even funnier to know what each of them are thinking. The different awkward/extreme/erotic situations Yamada and Kosuda end up in are hilarious. All for the purpose of Yamadas plans to seduce Kosuda. <br />
<br />
The art of the anime suited the anime well. Most of the girls are drawn not to make them perfect but to give them a sense of realism, they all have one of their own special &quot;features&quot; (eg big bewbs, slender body, cute face) , however they are not all perfect, which is a beautiful thannggg. Kosuda is presented as your average high school boy and he fits the description very well, hes not a blonde, feminine, perfect bishounen boy but an average looking boy with the build of a MAN.<br />
<br />
The sound of the anime was pretty average, the OP and ED weren&#039;t anything extraordinary. The voice acting was pretty good, they suited the characters quite well, I especially liked the &quot;OHOHOHO&quot; laugh of the rich girl Kanejou, oh Japan and your stereotypes. The random &quot;B Gata H Kei&quot; was surprisingly cute and catchy.<br />
<br />
Character is what I liked most about this anime, its hard to find a good horny female lead that actually has a personality. Damn, Yamada was so funny and very daring, she would go to extreme lengths to try to take Kosudas virginity, but somehow always fail. And her interpretation of things, seeing everything in a perverted way for example. Getting an earring as a present and seeing it as a symbol of &quot;I want to fuck you&quot; from Kosuda sent me into a state of hysteria of laughter. Kosuda, I really felt his pain when hes gets all confused as to why is this happening to him, man ALL THEM FEELS. I mean its not everyday a hot girl wants to steal your virginity. All through out the anime I was like oh damn if only you knew what she really wanted.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, it really is a unique romance comedy. I didn&#039;t want it to end, but when it did I tried to look for similar anime with no luck. It was like finding a rare gem in the vast ocean, you&#039;ll never find another one.<br />
<br />
Now I&#039;ve talked about the humor of this anime to a large extent, but this anime is also very unexpectedly romantic in a way, the intimacy the characters share shows the strong bond between them and really warms your heart to see them interacting. If you enjoy ecchi humor and surprisingly deep romance, I suggest you watch this anime. I don&#039;t recommend this to people who hate fan service, and &quot;dirty humor.&quot; <br />
<br />
But really who doesn&#039;t like sex?

    I&#039;ll be the first to admit that, somewhere in the back of my head, there&#039;s a dirty-minded twelve year old. I&#039;m referring to the part of my brain that silently laughs at sleazy jokes, sexual slurs, and crude double entendres. You could call it immaturity, or just plain stupidity, but there are occasions where I think things of that nature are hilarious, and I&#039;d be willing to bet that many people feel the same way. For various reasons, some good and some bad, some of us suppress the urge to laugh at this type of material—we&#039;ve found the little guy in our brain, and muzzled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review80210">
        him like a dog. So this type of comedy isn&#039;t going to hit the mark for everyone, and I can respect that. But if somewhere in your head that sneaky little bastard is still living, breathing, and laughing when badly written condom commercials come on the television, then you&#039;ll probably be able to derive a fair amount of enjoyment from B Gata H Kei.<br />
<br />
Normally I&#039;d start a review with a brief description of the show&#039;s plot to establish a little context. But in this case, the synopsis offered by MAL is pretty adequate. If you&#039;re like me, you&#039;ll probably have to read it twice just to make sure your eyes weren&#039;t playing tricks on you. Rest assured that your sanity is intact. It really does say “her dream was to have casual sex with 100 men.” So, with that out of the way, let&#039;s talk comedy.<br />
<br />
It&#039;d be easy to brush the series off as raunchy and tasteless based on what you&#039;ve read, and you&#039;d only be half wrong in doing in so; a lot of the comedy in B Gata H Kei consists of jokes about masturbation, condoms, and breasts. Granted, they&#039;re presented a little more cleverly than average, and often the jokes work in ways that are wholly unexpected. Many punchlines are reached through a window into the thoughts and fantasies of the characters, and this makes for a welcome mixture of visual and lingual humor that keeps things from getting too stale.<br />
<br />
However, what makes some of the comedy work is the endearing amount of self-awareness that the show seems to possess, and the frequency with which it pokes fun at some of the cliches and cheesier elements of traditional high-school comedies. Sarcastic jabs are made at the overused visual effects in which female characters “sparkle” when happy and project a visible black “aura” when angry. The same treatment is given to the cliche of having a foreign character appear attractive and classy, with the students frequently chanting “Raised overseas, indeed” in approval of an American-raised classmate. A few of the dimwitted male supporting characters seem to be aware of their own uselessness, and in one scene they comment that they&#039;re having fun because they&#039;re “getting more lines than usual.” These elements add a sense of wit and variety to what would otherwise be a show made entirely of shameless sexual humor. Many shows make the fatal mistake of taking themselves too seriously. B Gata H Kei, on the other hand, knows that it&#039;s a raunchy romcom, and embraces it.<br />
<br />
The cast of characters appears to have been put together pretty thoughtfully, and most of them add comedic value to the show in one way or another. Yamada herself is a walking joke, a play on the ideal “pure” schoolgirl that is depicted in most high-school shows. Her and the spacy, awkward Kosuda play very well off each other; Yamada projects an outward appearance of confidence and sexuality, but really, she&#039;s every bit as bumbling and insecure as her target. Sometimes the show generates humor based on sheer awkwardness as we watch both of them desperately try to figure out the meaning of the gestures made by the other. They both want the same thing, but they&#039;re both too thick-headed to do anything but beat around the bush.<br />
<br />
In addition to the two leads, the supporting roles are also used to good effect. It&#039;s a pretty big cast, but a few particular standouts include: Yamada&#039;s best friend, Takeshita, who delivers lines in a deadpan manner that&#039;s often as funny, if not funnier than, the over-the-top antics of the other characters; Misato, a thin and unattractive female classmate whose sexual frustration and inability to score are the butt of many a joke; Kyoka Kanejou, a rich and beautiful girl who is envious of Yamada and attempts to steal away the clueless Kosuda.<br />
<br />
It might also sound strange to say this, but B Gata H Kei actually does have thematic elements that are worth mentioning. Buried under a mountain of jokes, there&#039;s a cute little plot about two teenagers who are growing up just a little too fast, and trying to rush something that shouldn&#039;t be rushed. That isn&#039;t exactly winning the series any points in the originality department, and I must express a slight disappointment that such an original (and, frankly, just plain weird) idea quickly turns into something so ordinary. But nonetheless, it&#039;s nice to see a show where the comedy is formed around storytelling elements. Many comedies completely abandon the concept of “story” and just try to pour on the laughs, but B Gata H Kei makes no such mistake; most of the comedy is a natural extension of the plot. It&#039;s also worth noting that in terms of a “realistic” depiction of the pervasive awkwardness and uncertainty involved in early-teen relationships, B Gata H Kei comes pretty darn close despite the absurdity of its original premises.<br />
<br />
In the sound department, the series checks in at right about average. If you&#039;ve heard one “messing around in high school” soundtrack, you&#039;ve pretty much heard them all. There are upbeat jazz/pop songs meant to accentuate moments of rapid comedic dialogue and cute orchestral tracks for romantic and/or sad moments. The music here isn&#039;t a flop, but neither is it particularly memorable. The voice acting, on the other hand, is excellent. The two mains are perfect foils for each other. Yamada&#039;s voice is bold and ever-so-slightly masculine, while Kosuda&#039;s is generic and submissive. It&#039;s easy to see that these voice actors nailed it. Even the supporting cast manages to sound unique.<br />
<br />
Visually, B Gata H Kei is, once again, just about average. The character designs are not offensive, but merely as generic as you can get. I&#039;ll give them a break on Kosuda, because he&#039;s intentionally designed to look as uninteresting as possible, but all of the other characters really do look like they would be pages in a book titled “Drawing High Schoolers on a Budget.” The most frequent setting is the classroom, so there are not a lot of chances to show off the background art, which is reasonably attractive. The animation is mediocre, but whether or not this really matters is a different question, since motion is rarely a part of the comedic styling or plot progression of the series. This is not a great looking show, but the visuals are adequate to get us where we&#039;re going.<br />
<br />
In the end I&#039;m left with the impression that B Gata H Kei certainly isn&#039;t a groundbreaking or incredible series. There are a few missteps and missed opportunities. But if you&#039;re looking for something that&#039;s lighthearted, cute, funny, and doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously, this is a good option—provided you can bear in mind that much of the humor here is shameless and racy, and embrace that fact.

    B Gata H Kei ended up being not quite what I expected.  I would have been perfectly content with the premise as laid out, and yet what I was given was a story sweeter than a lot of other anime set out to create.  The show barely has fanservice beyond the first episode, and when there is nudity at all, it feels like you have trespassed into an intimate moment.  The framing of these scenes becomes deliberately nonsexual, because the point isn&#039;t to tease the viewer, but help you empathize with the emotions of protagonist Yamada.<br />
Yamada is a type of character I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165027">
        don&#039;t often see allowed to exist in anime.  Reminiscent of Tomoko from Watamote, she is unabashedly an asshole but also deeply vulnerable in a realistic and relatable way.  Her characterization could have been pushed further, there was a lot more room for her to grow, but as it stands, I was happy to once again see a female character portrayed in this type of light.  Adolescence is hard, and I found a lot of common ground with Yamada, even if she simultaneously frustrates me with the way she treats people.  The climactic scene of the series might also be one of my favorites in anime, it is definitely the most well done part of the show.  It felt written and directed full of love and compassion, and was very refreshing after seeing so many characters in so many other series barely get anywhere in their relationship.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say I disliked all that much about this series, aside from Yamada needing some more character development, and maybe more side character growth as well.  The dub was well localized, so it was funny enough.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes romance and seeing couples come together- you really shouldn&#039;t be disappointed if that is what you&#039;re looking for.  As you can see by the other reviews, this show resonated with a lot of people.

    B Gata H Kei is wrong in all of the right ways. I feel like this kind of series might not attract many girls, but if you are female, it isn&#039;t just a show of male fantasy.  I couldn&#039;t get enough of it, and found myself wanting more even as the last episode finished. I&#039;m not much a fan of ecchi, but sometimes something will spark my interest and I have to watch it. This series was definitely one of those.<br />
<br />
Story: 8. This story is about a high school girl who wants to have sex with one hundred men. That said, a viewer might

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62619">
        think this series includes a lot of sex when it is mostly about a girl and a guy in high school who want to have sex and have no idea what to do. It&#039;s very real to life, and somewhat similar to what I went through in high school. <br />
<br />
Art: 8. The artwork was good and the facial expressions, hilarious. It didn&#039;t have a point where the art lacked like a lot of newer series, and overall, it was pleasant to look at.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7. I give it a seven because, to be honest, some of the voice acting can get a bit on my nerves at times. It&#039;s not nearly as bad as some of the series I&#039;ve seen, but a few of the voices of the minor characters were annoying. It&#039;s not a big problem, and the overall sound quality was fantastic.<br />
<br />
Character: 8. The characters were all fairly unique and all of the characters had their own interesting points. The main characters, Yamada and Kosuda were fairly typical teenagers, and I think they&#039;re fairly relate-able in this regard.  The minor characters were all interesting as well, and I never felt like the characters were bringing down the story at all. I honestly would very much like spinoffs featuring some of them, because it would be hilarious as well as interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9. I&#039;m a bit of a sadist, so I thoroughly enjoyed watching every installment of Yamada and Kosuda fail at trying to have sex with each other. Personally, I found this series a laugh a minute, and I spent so much time trying not to laugh, especially during the last episode.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8. As I said, it&#039;s bad in all the right ways. It&#039;s distinctly filthy where it needs to be and really shows how awkward talking about sex and having sex for the first time can really be. There&#039;s not much I can say without giving spoilers, but from the moment I heard this show&#039;s premise, I knew I was going to love it.

    Ecchi at its finest.<br />
<br />
B Gata H Kei isn&#039;t like your typical romance story, or ecchi for that fact. We have a young adolescent, ambitious for sex, otherwise known as the famous Yamada throughout the whole series. The whole story revolves around our heroine attempting to get a rather large amount of &quot;sex buddies&quot;. Getting there might be quite hard for her, considering she is insecure about the appearance of her vagina. Due to this, she seeks for a male partner, also a virgin, which is where our dear Kosuda comes in.<br />
<br />
These two characters both are two opposites, it isn&#039;t mentioned throughout the series, but us

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27303">
        viewers could probably determine it. First we&#039;ve got Yamada, our omniscient sex do-want female. A true beaut amongst her classmates, seeking for intimate relationships. Then there&#039;s Kosuda, a young adolescent that endeavors to even understand Yamada.<br />
<br />
In this relationship, Yamada is the dirty one. Makes it more fun, eh? They both deserve a well earned 9.<br />
<br />
The art and animation for this anime was amazing, though I give it an 8 because I&#039;m not a fan of the big head skinny neck art. It&#039;s good, but not exactly my cup of tea. Asides that, everything was made exceptional.<br />
<br />
The sound was great, as well. The opening and ending are a joy themselves for those who watch the whole episode. The background music played throughout is well fitted, makes the essence more vivid.<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy the anime? But of course, the series is far too short to drag, and every episode keeps you wanting more of Yamada. You never know what she has to bring.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime a 9.The plot was very original, and it was outstanding.<br />
<br />
~A side note, I&#039;m not one who reviews animes a lot, and this is infact my first review. Judgments upon myself.

    This is a rare find. Critics were quick to categorize it as &quot;more ecchi crud&quot; but it isn&#039;t! Masterpiece for it&#039;s kind.<br />
<br />
This anime is hilarious, presentation is mature, there is actually witty comments and it&#039;s suggestive enough to keep you interested without actually revealing too much... PLUS they manage to pull it off without having stupid characters.

    This is NOT your typical fan service perverted ecchi.  Indeed, I have never watched an ecchi anime before this one and was drawn to this series because Brittney Karbowski had provided the dubbing.<br />
<br />
The trailer and advertising does not do the show any favours and any anime fan may roll their eyes at such a ridiculous premise of a story.  This would be a mistake.  In reality, this excellent series is a very humourous light-hearted comedy and the true story is that of Yamada&#039;s misconception of sex and the &#039;first-time&#039;.  Her relentless pursuit of the harmless Kosuda as her first partner &#039;to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55321">
        break the seal&#039; sees the development of an unlikely teenage relationship.<br />
<br />
Yamada is a somewhat typical tsundere character and the English dubbing does her complete justice.  I was so impressed with the humour, I actually read the rest of the manga and was further impressed with the quality of the story after the anime ends.  It certainly whets your appetite and I hope they do a second series.<br />
<br />
The actual nudity in the series is occasional and appropriate to the setting.  It would equally fit in well with a drama or romance anime and, as mentioned, is atypical of an &#039;ecchi&#039; anime.  I would go so far as to say this really should be reclassified as a romantic-comedy.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be put be off by the idea that this is an &#039;ecchi&#039; and of the theme of Yamada&#039;s goals - the real story is something much more than this and will have you in stitches.

    Now it&#039;s true that for some, if not a lot of us have had awkward periods during our teen years.  We&#039;ve also had our fair share of the &quot;Birds and the Bees&quot; also.  Well my friends, this anime not only depicts these moments, but takes it to a whole other level. For an ecchi anime to portray such misgivings of youth, well... They did a kick-ass job!<br />
<br />
Story - 10:<br />
<br />
First off, the introduction of the storyline is something that I, nor I think anybody in the real world would ever be able to see; at least in a rational one.  100 sex friends?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28955">
        Well that got my attention.  <br />
<br />
The plot itself is original at least to a point: girl wants some; girl finds  guy, girl falls in love, the end.  But of course along the way, she encounters many &quot;obstacles&quot;.  Don&#039;t want to give anymore spoilers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art - 9:<br />
<br />
The art was crisp and vibrant.  There was no need for any &quot;real world&quot; effects here, just crazy scenes with the typical anime emoticons you find in a lot of comedy-style animes.  Although... Some of the girls have disproportionately large ta-ta&#039;s for their heights (not too mention age -  though sometimes that happens in real life too).  But hey  an ecchi anime almost always requires those right?i  Boin away!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound - 8:<br />
<br />
The OP and ED are very cutesy, and definitely lively.  It&#039;s so fitting for the main character&#039;s personality.   It has a moe feel, but you will know that feeling arises after watching at least one episode<br />
<br />
<br />
Character 10:<br />
<br />
This is where anime shines the most.  The Main character Yamada isn&#039;t your normal school girl, and by &quot;normal&quot; I mean that in psychological terms.  She has that tsundere-like feel sometimes, but most of the time, she would do nothing but think about what most guys think about their whole life: sex. That itself is an original; not to mention a shock in our society.<br />
<br />
The other main character Takashi is that of an awkward boy just trying to survive high school, who happens to get the nickname &quot;cherry boy&quot; when he meets Yamada for the first time.  By awkward, I mean trip on a peanut awkward.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters we have the un-datable girl, the little spoiled (and kiss x sis-like) princess,  the shy childhood lady friend, and of course the rational friend. An almost complete set<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - &gt;10:<br />
<br />
Yes, it was that great.  I looked forward to every episode because I know I have to order new lungs because I would laugh so hard.  Not only that, some of the scenarios are what typical teenagers face, which prompted me in flashbacks; these then would cause me to either laugh more, or scream like a little girl.  Yes, it invoked many voices out of me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall - 9.5:<br />
<br />
Having no decimal point system, I will break the law of round out by giving it a 9 on the official board.  The whole series was funny, ecchi, and sometimes even reminded me of some awkward situations. the 0.5 lost was for some of the slow episodes which I really did not expect.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want ecchi, it&#039;s got plenty, you want high school, they got it also. You want a horny girl, it&#039;s got it.  This is one of the most entertaining animes I&#039;ve watched for 2010.

    After reading the many glowing review of B Gata H Kei, I feel like I watched a completely different show. It&#039;s a very watchable but very unlikeable anime.<br />
<br />
It begins well enough with Yamada wanting to lose her virginity so she can work toward her highest goal of having 100 fuck buddies. The best person to lose her virginity to, she decides, is Kosuda, another virgin. Yamada makes a few bold actions toward Kosuda but she never follows through or explains herself. Kosuda is not an idiot, he&#039;s just completely bewildered by this deranged girl. This is where the series falls apart.<br />
<br />
Yamada will make advances toward

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34034">
        Kosuda only to push him away or yell at him. She&#039;s the main character and after only a couple of episodes, you&#039;re completely against her. After the pair walk home in the rain, you think that she will begin to develop real feelings for Kosuda, but instead she becomes more rude toward him. It doesn&#039;t matter that Yamada&#039;s actions are due to her being scared of actually having sex; she comes across as an unlikeable lunatic.<br />
<br />
Eventually a villain of sorts is introduced - the beautiful and popular Kanejou. She plots to find, steal, and dump Yamada&#039;s boyfriend. Also introduced is Kosuda&#039;s childhood friend - a girl named Mayu who actually likes and wants to be with Kosuda. These are the characters you should be cheering on. Unfortunately, their stories ultimately go nowhere while Yamada and Kosuda build up to a disappointing ending. Yamada almost has a redemption in the last couple of episodes, but it&#039;s difficult to see if she really changed or not.

    This show is a lot more than what it presents to you during it&#039;s premiere episode. Sure, it has it&#039;s ecchi parts, but I take it more as a more realistic romance than most animes we see. Most romance animes hold kissing as the climax of the entire show, and it is rarely seen that sex or anything beyond that is portrayed. Today we dive into the vulgar, sex-joke filled realm of B Gata H Kei, and see what stood strong and what flopped (lol i dirty).<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Story: <br />
The premise is rather simple: Yamada wants to get laid a hundred times but wants to start it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review134643">
        off with a virgin, just like her. The thing is that this premise is completely false to what the show is actually setting off to do. Since Yamada is so inexperienced in sex and all things dirty, she is all but willing to jump in bed with the main male protagonist and resident cherry boy Kosuda. It instead focuses more on the relationship between the two and their various endeavors to get rid of the god-forsaken V-card. Coupled with the fast paced and hilarious(most of the time) comedy, works very well. Let&#039;s just say that if you like vulgar, low-brow comedy, you&#039;ll get a kick out of this. However,the ending really puts a bad aftertaste in you&#039;re mouth. There is so many plot holes that leave you guessing. Absolutely nothing gets accomplished, and this includes the side stories. It&#039;s basically a &quot;Read the Manga&quot; style ending, which kind of sucks.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
In most cases, I think Yamada would be a character I would outright despise. But since this is an ecchi comedy show, her naivety and overall cowardness brings a lot to the table in terms of comedy. Sure, she can be downright annoying and tsundere at times, but she just fits into the overall theme of the show so well that you can look past a lot of the faults she has. Then we have Kosuda, the similarly shy, but more passive than aggressive love interest. I liked his character mainly because even though Yamada is flirting around this guy like mad, he still has the sense to take it relatively slow, and treat her like more than a walking pair of breasts, which is basically a complete contrast to Yamada. Their relationship is more or less a combination between Japanese and Western romances. There is the lust and want for sex, but then you have the awkwardidity (ya I totally didn&#039;t make that word up) to actually do that stuff. It&#039;s much more refreshing than anything. Moving on, the supporting cast did what they needed to, but could have had a bit more development in the long run. As weird as it is for me to say this, I want to figure out what the how the weird incest side plot between two characters was going to work out. They added a lot more comedy to the show, and the show already has a lot to begin with. This goes back to the plot hole ending, where a bit more time could&#039;ve fleshed out the characters to be more likeable in the long run.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Sound and Animation:<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t anything special about these, to be honest. The animation was fair, but their wasn&#039;t enough movement to really observe and call it amazing. The art style worked, but felt 2D in places. And of course, the character designs were sexy where they needed to be, but still a little simple. The soundtrack is really quite forgettable, as nothing stood out to me in the slightest. However, I am quite pleased with the voice acting in this particular anime. There were a few missteps in the English dub (Kanajo), as some voices did sound a bit stale, but for the most part, the over-exuberant voices added to the comedy aspect of the show immensely. To end off on a high note, the opening was catchy, and had the best animation in the entire show, so, major plus there. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
To end off, this show is definitely something at least some people would enjoy. The whole show just screams hilarity, whether it be from Yamada&#039;s random antics to the deity&#039;s spewing of dirty sex jokes. However, the ending was utter crap, and left so many plot holes you could fly a plane through and end up in Japan to yell at the writers about it. Furthermore, although I did like Yamada&#039;s character and thought she fit with the show extremely well, I can see how many can see her as a major turn off from her slutty aspect. But lets be honest here, this is an ecchi show, so it&#039;s to be expected. The animation and sound are passable, but really are not anything special by any stretch of the imagination.In summary, this show is flawed in many aspects, leaving it with an average score, but for the &quot;turn you&#039;re brain off&quot; aspect, which in this show is the most important aspect, succeeds with flying colours.  B Gata H Kei is not something to have on the top of you&#039;re list, but if you want to turn you&#039;re brain off and let you&#039;re hormones and funny bone run wild for a while, this is a pretty good recommendation.

    A show as I would personally describe as an anime that teaches what boys should be and what girls should NOT. But kudos to Yamada for promoting condoms. Anyways you think this is your chip-off the old block fanservice, ecchi anime? No and yes.<br />
<br />
Why No?<br />
The main character of this anime is Yamada, a 15 year old teenager in a questionable heat of things. For one, her priority is nothing but sex in a relationship and wants as many partners as possible. Her best friend, a big-breasted girl, Takeshita, is always looking out for her. Even to the point she is sick and tired of slapping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27076">
        sense in her head. A loyal friend indeed.<br />
<br />
Hakuro: Yamada might want to get a HIV check when she&#039;s 30 if that happens<br />
<br />
Well that WAS her goal. Until she found a suitable prey.<br />
Introducing the main man of this anime. Takashi Kosuda!. Your normal, average, ordinary 15 year old boy. Being hunted down by the predator Yamada. Like I said, ordinary. Nothing special except his &quot;cherry status&quot; (chastity) that Yamada is after.<br />
<br />
Why Yes?<br />
The &quot;run-in to the boy you met before in school the next day kind of starting&quot; with a twist. Well there are classic scenes with underwear showing accidentally. But other than that. Nothing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m done with the characters side. All in all this anime is hilariously funny.<br />
<br />
Art: As an aspiring mangaka I have to say the art is pretty cute. And the background and scenery is very detailed.<br />
<br />
Sound: Average. Nothing much but adds a serious funny effect when it comes to the funny parts. LOL<br />
<br />
Hai~sankyuu for taking your time to read my review. Don&#039;t kill me, its my 2nd time and this is for old-times sake since its ending soon. (:<br />

    Relationships can be one of the craziest puzzles of life, and are without a doubt one of the most enjoyable parts of being a teenager. Unless of course, you can’t get a girlfriend and you look really plain and boring. That’s the problem with Takasu Kosuda. He’s average looking and not all that exciting. But somehow he manages to find himself in a weird relationship with one of the hottest girls in his high school, Yamada. The problem is he doesn’t understand that she only wants him to bang him because her whole goal in life is to have one hundred “fuck-buddies”. So essentially, she’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188527">
        the biggest slut around and is the main character of this romantic comedy anime, meaning I’m supposed to enjoy watching her trials and errors in getting to shag Kosuda.The problem with this idea is the fact that she is so reprehensible and reminds me of every episode of Dr. Phil showcasing wild, sex crazed teens. But we’ll talk about her in a moment. Right now, let’s touch a little more on the story of this anime.<br />
<br />
Guy meets girl. Girl’s a slut. Guy falls for girl, not realizing she’s just in it to bang him because she thinks he will be easy. Girl falls for guy and that’s it. There is of course some competition over the guy and a girl who likes him but won’t admit to it. It’s just straight up genericism, which is a word I’ve been using way too often for romantic comedies. I mean, I can deal with some plot conventions and the obligatory scenes, but there comes a point in time where you ask yourself why these shows can’t be just a tad different. You pull the characters from one show, put them in another; pull the backgrounds from one show, put them in another. Original romantic comedies are hard to come by, and admittedly my favorite, Toradora!, is quite honestly very conventional. And B Gata H Kei follows the same conventions that just get to be like a chore. Here’s the obligatory scenes I seem to mention for every romantic comedy review:<br />
<br />
-The Pool (x2 even!)<br />
-Festival (Why is it that every time you go to the pool it is followed by a random festival?)<br />
-Cultural Festival (Why is it always a maid café or a café of some sort?)<br />
-Field Trip<br />
-Bath<br />
-Bathhouse<br />
-Christmas (x2)<br />
<br />
And the formula for these areas aren’t changed at all. It’s all very typical and unintuitive. Some people might get their panties in a bunch because of some of the mentions and my being too picky about what is conventional and what isn’t. For them I have to say that there are millions of things to do and places to go yet romance/comedy series always wind up at these same places. I have even gone so far as to commend one anime for the sheer fact it used a karaoke establishment as a setting. I mean, this anime I will commend for the love hotel scene, which I can’t commend as much for the content as the use of the hotel. Because while I do enjoy a good bout of sex every once in a while, the sex scenes in this show are idiotic. I mean, they aren’t really “sex” scenes because nothing ever gets accomplished (at least, in the “climax” sense) but they still exhibit a sort of reprehensible aura. And I didn’t feel it as much from main character Yamada. She’s the one who wants to bang, yet she’s very reserved and kind of shy about it. Kosuda, the quiet and boring one is the most feral of the two and for a virgin, he sure goes right for it like a playa.<br />
<br />
What’s even more reprehensible is if you actually look at how many times Kosuda and Yamada have gone out and how much they really know about each other, their having sex is completely ridiculous. Just the fact that they love each other and know jack-shit about each other in and of itself is weird. The romantic parts of the comedy fall short because of that.<br />
<br />
Though I will admit that the sex scenes and a lot of the sex related humor toward the end were hilarious. But otherwise the anime isn’t that funny. About partway through there is a point where Yamada tells the camera “That last bit wasn’t raunchy enough”. To tell the truth, up to the very end, which is actually pretty unexpectedly risqué, B Gata H Kei isn’t all that raunchy. Its comedy is an attempt at raunch, but not a good one. Let’s face it, boner jokes aren’t all that funny after you’ve had a couple hundred over the course of your life and you can’t make me laugh with more boob jokes. The condom joke is overplayed and it isn’t very funny most of the time.<br />
<br />
The animation is okay. Characters do look decent, and backgrounds as well, but it’s all very average and unexciting.<br />
<br />
The opening theme could be pasted onto any romantic comedy, as could the ending. The music during the show is basic. Characters all sound good.<br />
<br />
The character section is typically where I bash a show and this is no different. Let’s start with Kosuda who I found to be a piece of cardboard at first. He had no character whatsoever. Which is part of the whole idea, he’s a basic looking guy with no distinct personality traits. But as stated previously, the moment that sex comes up he becomes an animal. Which, yes, he’s a guy so that is easily the case. But a virgin? And he’s so embarrassed by it too yet goes at it like a trooper. His character is confusing because of those mood swings.<br />
<br />
Yamada is a different entity that I’ve touched upon a bit. At the start of the anime she’s reprehensible. She’s borderline disgusting. I mean, the first scene of her entails her checking out her private bits and complaining because it looks weird. And then she goes to this one hundred fuck buddies deal and she degrades from there. As things develop between her and Kosuda, it starts off downright horrible where she is using him and abusing him. She doesn’t seem to like him and he likes her. And while this romance is both rushed and unrealistic, it still is painful to watch her string him out and when she finally admits to liking him a great weight is lifted from my chest. And so many people like this character! Sure, she was a bit more likeable toward the end, but she was still a bad character who never grows on you.<br />
<br />
And yet one of the most hated characters of the series is Kyouka Kanejou? Sure, the creepy brother love thing was creepy, but she was just as bad as Yamada. She is of course, your typical rich bitchy  girl who hides behind a cute mask. She’s essentially Ami from Toradora!. Hell, she IS Ami from Toradora! with a brother complex. She even tries to steal Kosuda from Yamada at one point, just like Ami attempting to steal Ryuuji!<br />
<br />
The other major character is Mayu Miyano, who is just as boring as every other character. She’s a klutz, she likes Kosuda but can’t get the balls to tell him, and is just there. She doesn’t do much or accomplish much.<br />
<br />
It’s sad when my favorite character is Mami Misato, who was one of the characters with the least role in the show. She’s a tiny, crazy girl. She’s in love with Kanejou’s brother (just like Kanejou) and is actually fairly entertaining.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the rest of the characters aren’t interesting enough to get into.<br />
<br />
There are so many questions I want to ask the creator of this show. Where did the idea come from? Where is the funny? And then there are just general questions I ask myself such as: When did incest become a conventional plot device in romantic comedies?<br />
<br />
You know why something like Toradora! worked despite being fairly conventional? Because it had likeable characters, that while cut and paste, acted realistically and took on a life of their own. Also, the relationships and emotions were believable. Something like this cannot even compare to that. The best merit I can give this anime is that it has a clearly defined romance and it ends satisfactorily.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, B Gata H Kei is pretty bad.  I can’t believe the sheer amount of good reviews this gets. If you’re in middle school it may be funny because “SEX” and “CONDOMS” and “BOOBS” but if you have grown to an age where you are more mature than that, you’ll realize that this is idiotic and a waste of time. I mean, I respect everyone’s good reviews of it, but I just don’t understand how anyone can love the character of Yamada. Even if you take her as a funny caricature of a typical high school girl she’s still downright unlikeable.<br />
<br />
There are much better romantic comedies out there.
