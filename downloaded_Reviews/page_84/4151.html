    Anime almost feels like a religion sometimes. Anyone who is a faithful follower will recognize that the concept of CGDCT (“Cute Girls Doing Cute Things”) always has a spot in every season. It’s 2018 and we had series like Yuru Camp that expressed the joy of comfy camping, Comic Girls to showcase the concept of manga crafting, and even Harukana Receive about beach volleyball with sexy sporty girls doing athletic things.  Manga Time Kirara seems to never run out of ideas and their family of magazines will probably never disappear in our time. Before I die, Anima Yell is another show that I checked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296602">
        off the bucket list that I didn’t regret.<br />
<br />
Anyone familiar with Doga Kobo will easily know their talent that usually adhere to schoolgirls and slice of life. Anima Yell doesn’t derive far from their usual trend although it has an interesting concept about cheerleading. From the first few episodes, we are introduced to Kohane Hatoya, an energetic schoolgirl who have fallen in love with the sport of cheerleading. What’s her goal? It’s basically to form a club with her friends and share their passion and joy. Say hello to the main cast consisting of Hizume Arima, Uki Sawatari, Kotetsu Tatejima, and Kana Ushiku.<br />
<br />
Now I’ll be honest. If you’re not familiar with Doga Kobo’s other works, then it may be hard to embrace this show. Their modus operandi generally has a female main cast that sometimes also consists of soft shoujo-ai. You can see them through some of the character interactions although Anima Yell is light on this. There is one episode with a short plot about how to get the crush of a girl while other episodes consists of teases. The center of attention is Hizume Arima, the cool girl and ace of the group. At school, she’s admired as a beauty and often attracts attention whether she likes it or not. It’s no secret that other girls wants her and that even includes one of the group’s own members, Kana Ushiku. <br />
<br />
But let’s go back to square one for a bit. The one that started this all is the ultra-upbeat girl, Kohane Hatoya. While she isn’t a child prodigy with impressive skills, there’s no doubt that her personality is influential to others. She is always helpful and can make friends with just about anyone. This even includes Hizume, the cool girl who isn’t easy to open herself to others. Kohane’s love for cheerleading borders on obsession and often causes hilarious scenes between her and others. My impression of Kohane is that she’s pretty much the poster girl of selling the main context for this show. She’s there to deliver her passion and is ready to be received by the audience. There are many episodes where her personality enables others to see what she enjoys in. And such, her group grows more in a positive way.<br />
<br />
For such a charming anime, you may wonder what to be aware of the main plot. Honestly, it’s very loose as each episode presents itself like a storybook. It ties the whole show together through the essence of cheerleading with a great amount of colorful personalities. Each of the main cast is diverse enough to stand out individually. However, I do admit that some characters are less likable to others. Personally, I find Kotetsu Tatejima’s timid personality to be borderline annoying. Her lack of confidence sometimes feels embarrassing to watch and is no doubt in my mind the weakest link in the group. This is a sharp contrast compared to Hizume, the girl with previous experience in cheerleading. In fact, the series even has background story about why she got kicked out of her old squad until she decides to embrace the love of cheerleading again. Beyond the main cast, there isn’t much to say about any others as most of the episodes consists of throwaway characters. In other words, any minor character you see rarely appears again and easily forgettable. <br />
<br />
Well, they&#039;ve done it again. Thanks to Doga Kobo’s colorful art style, Anima Yell stands on its feet as an adorable show with cute girls. Cheerleading in this series is portrayed as an upbeat sport and the characters (especially Kohane) show great enthusiasm. There’s an abundant amount of character expressions that often stretches themselves over the line with its humorous gags. Kohane is the main culprit of this due to her excitement about cheerleading. Often, she just pushes any situation into such direction and it’s pretty damn priceless. The character designs for the cheerleading outfits themselves are well decorated with vibrant touches and stylish colors. Surprisingly, I’m also impressed by the overall direction of the choreography. There&#039;s even excitement expressed by the body language of their performances. Their performances in this show also keeps its pace and carries an adamant momentum that&#039;s hard to keep eyes off of. I’m not a big fan of cheerleading but there wasn’t one episode that made me walk away from those performances. Well done again, girls.<br />
<br />
I bet anime fans are questioning in today’s world if we have too many shows about “cute girls doing cute things”. Now, we have cute girls doing cute cheerleading things. But really, Anima Yell isn’t here to jump on the bandwagon. Instead, it’s a show that has a lot of heart thanks to Kohane’s club with her friends.

    A charming, high energy high school SoL. Once more we find the &quot;create a high school club&quot; story you&#039;ve probably seen a million times, but with something else in mind. If I had to say something bad about Anima Yell it would be the story. There&#039;s nothing quite special or surprising about the story, so just go along with it or you might be disappointed. Repetitiveness may be a problem later on. If I had to say something good about Anima Yell it would easily be the lines. Clever and funny lines make for episodes sure to make you smile every time. The lines make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293422">
        it easy for the VAs to deliver charming performances that are both adorable and energetic. Animation is well above average, with movements and flowing motions that have an elegance to them if you look closely. The cast of characters is one of the strong points in the show, with personalities that are hard to hate. A lively soundtrack is subtle, but makes it&#039;s presence felt with great consistency. Art is soft and colorful, making for some pleasing scenery both in the backgrounds and on characters. <br />
Overall it&#039;s a common SoL high school like any other you&#039;d find out there, but with a different theme and lovely cast. If you hate these types of shows it certainly would fall under the moeblob category, but I find it more charming than most and many characters are instant favorites. Calling it average isn&#039;t exactly an insult for this one, that&#039;s what it wants to be and it does it in a way that&#039;s fun. Favorite characters: Kohane, Arima. I give it a 8/10.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Version: Moeblob start a high school club routine. Gets repetitive, but not hollow like many similar shows can feel. Solid comedy. Great cast and creative lines. Nice visuals.

    Once again, another 4-koma CGDCT adaptation action, but this time, we&#039;re off to &quot;chair&quot;...er I mean, cheerleading!<br />
<br />
We all know the deal with high school girls, especially when they move on from middle school, and the big deal with Year 1s are always with enrollment...and of course, mandatory clubs to join for their years of high school life. Well, not with one person by the name of shortie Hatoya Kohane, whom by the sight of cheerleading, mentions: &quot;I found something I wanna do, and that is called...CHAIR!&quot; Her childhood friend Uki Sawatari finds it a joke...&quot;Chair&quot; (literally)? <br />
<br />
Eventually, this act of kindness (from Kohane) forwards that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296607">
        joke up to experienced-but-frightening Hizume Arima, their own homeroom teacher Inukai (whom she obliges), shy-with-stage-fright(ened) Kotetsu Tatejima (or Kotecchan), and eventually Hizume&#039;s old cheerleading group-cum-crush-of-a-teammate Kana Ushiku (through Hizume&#039;s bidding). these 5 characters would form the Kaminoki Highschool Cheerleading Club, which is the &quot;create a high school club&quot; archetype, while maintaining the SoL-moe aspects throughout the series.<br />
<br />
So, similar to 4-koma manga adaptations is where there isn&#039;t really existence of a story (or plot if you will), because certain things will eventually loop the same old boredom once through, then recycles the jokes all over. But, what salvages the series are the characters, starting with the MC Kohane herself. She is kind, she sometimes act like a chirping bird due to the way she converses with the others, and at times attempt even the silliest jokes that turn to regret soon. But what Kohane has going for her is the never-say-die spirit, even when at the slightest amount of cheer for encouragement (mostly Basket-senpai for their school&#039;s girls&#039; basketball team). That&#039;s where Uki comes in as a mum-like feeling of watching over Kohane as a kid, and also guiding over others and learning cheerleading with everyone else. Not to mention the childhood friend love, it exists here as sort of means of infatuation between Uki&#039;s secret desires and the elusive Kohane.<br />
<br />
Kotetsu (or Kotecchan) is the shy, reserved one, but does to her excellence when alone. So it&#039;s no wonder when she shivers at the thoughts of presenting herself to others outside her comfort zone, and goes into her blank space of thought. But with bit by bit of push, she eventually makes it so that her fear of showcase doesn&#039;t hinder her emotions and in direct force, transforms her fear into fun.<br />
<br />
Hizume and Kana&#039;s on-the-rocks relationship is something worth to take note for. For one, when Hizume was pitched the cheerleading regime once again from hopeful Kohane, her dark past was something of a trauma that she could not shake off, due to insider competition and rivalry, so much so that when she left her old group, that burden of perfection was gone. But now with Kohane, Hizume realized that releasing her old strides and making them new with promises that assure the group can stay motivated, that is where she begins to rally the fun in cheerleading, and even rivals never denying the change that made her a better person (but she constantly fears Kohane&#039;s 2nd thoughts of leaving cheerleading, which are damn hilarious). As for Kana, let&#039;s just say that her boasting to Kohane and Co. for underestimating Hizume&#039;s greatness causes her to have an infatuation, the look-up-to model for perfection, that in turn, directs her love for Hizume in pure Yuri fashion (always nice and funny to see her blemish in hot-red-full facial expression in Hizume&#039;s presence). Other than agree-to-disagree, she coaches Kohane and others to do things correctly and give aspiration as means of encouragement.<br />
<br />
What I do like about the characters is that no matter their intriguing chemistry with one another, they constantly pull off funny and hilarious one-liners that just doesn&#039;t make any logical sense, even if there are a few in-betweens. Hizume&#039;s constant fear of casual backlash, Uki and Kana&#039;s obsession with their significant others, even Kotecchan&#039;s depressional moments, good stuff.<br />
<br />
Again, Doga Kobo&#039;s aesthetics always pull it off in the simplest but lavishing way possible, and it&#039;s nice to see good art and animation that blends very well in showcasing simple story and not-so-complex character designs and the like. A firm nice touch is what this series need, and it&#039;s more than enough. Same goes with the music, well, mostly cheerleading music (apart from OP and ED), which again is a nice compliment to the journey of these 5 characters which presents their form and conformance to one another, that despite their differences, they can trust one another and dance to the beat with synchronization.<br />
<br />
Somehow lately, CGDCT shows are quite mainstream now, but if you find yourself loving moe-blobs dancing and cheering around like nobody&#039;s business, then this show&#039;s for you. If you decide to learn cheerleading yourself, this series is also a good place to begin, so get your body moving to &quot;chair&quot;-leading!

    Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Anima Yell and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />

Based off a popular manga of the same name Anima yell is a comedy, sports and school genre based anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a girl who loves to be helpful and caring towards others were to come across an activity and sport that would not just allow her to improve the way in which she can help

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296620">
        and support others but also do so in the company of like-minded individuals who share her passion for wanting to help and motivate others through their actions as cheerleaders. The subject matter of cheerleading has always been a rather curious topic in my eyes as while I understand the core concepts behind it, I always thought that the effects that it will have on the ones being cheered on were only marginal due largely to the fact that its restricted to sports which relies more on the skill of the player more than anything. However, the insight into the kind of motivation that cheerleaders have for entering that sport as well as the kind of training that it requires to be good at it really helped change my mind. The first episode of the series I felt left a pretty good impression on me as it not only did well in introducing the main characters of Kohane and Arima but also of the kind of motivations that one can develop for wanting to enter the sport of cheerleading. While certainly impressing me, I have to say that one of the core reasons for me deciding to watch this series to the end was my curiosity of whether Kohane’s carefree personality will be able to endure the harsh training that comes from being a cheerleader. <br />
<br />
Taking place in a fictional town in modern day Japan the overall story of Anima yell follows the adventures of Kohane Hatoya a 14-year-old middle school student who despite her young age has already developed a reputation for wanting to be helpful and caring towards all that she encounters as she walks the path that is called life. In the past Kohane had a chance encounter with a middle school cheerleading squad whose performance and the effects that it had on the morale of the audience have left such a vivid impression on Kohane that it awakened within her a determined attempt to introduce the activity of cheer to not just her friends but to everyone that she meets as well. After entering middle school Kohane becomes determined to promote the activity of cheer to others but is dismayed to find that such a club does not exist in the school. Though disappointed at this Kohane doesn’t lose heart and after a chance encounter with the person that motivated her to take this path Kohane soon managed to fulfill her earnest desire of creating a cheer club and began her training to become a cheerleader aiming to bring joy and motivation to all that she meets. Though the training will be hard and the performances tiring to Kohane being able to bring joy to others and help motivate them in their actions is all the motivation that she needs to go about her duty. But Kohane will not be alone in this endeavor for joining her will be a host of characters whose reason for joining the club may be varied but all have a genuine desire to not just improve themselves but also through their hard work hope to bring joy to others and help bring light to their life. These include the quiet and curious Kotetsu, the kind but determined Arima, the perceptive and understanding Uki and the confident and proud Kana. Together these girls must not only learn to overcome their differences but also learn to bond with and forge friendships with each other as they try their utmost to use the skills and techniques that they have learned in their hard training to bring joy to others by giving off fantastic performances. <br />
<br />
Kohane <br />
<br />
Kohane Hatoya portrayed by new seiyuu Yuka Ozaki is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 15-year-old middle school student Kohane on initial appearance can be seen to be a positive, cheerful and highly energetic girl who tries hard to be helpful to everyone that she meets in her daily life. A kind, caring and friendly person by nature Kohane while determined to help people can also be seen as being rather innocent with her actions as she in her quest to help those in need has a habit of reacting without thinking about the larger issues that may be in play. However, while it can be seen as a disadvantage, in this case, it can also be seen as a strength as well as Kohane thanks to her overactive nature can be relied upon to take up any job no matter how difficult it seems to be. This when combined with her determined nature allowed the members of the cheer association to garner up a solid reputation within weeks of their forming. This determination to fulfill the requests that are made upon the association by their clients is best seen in the myriad number of performances that Kohane and friends give in the course of the series. While Kohane may be prone to misunderstand instructions that often lead to accidents in practice I felt that this aspect of her actually made her more endearing as it showed that despite the complexity involved in training Kohane is still trying hard to take it all in and become an effective cheerleader. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Kohane’s personality is expanded upon Kohane’s personality gradually starts to change. In the beginning of the series while noted to be a positive, cheerful and energetic person by both her fellow classmates and her fellow club members Kohane was also noted for her rather short attention span which when combined with her clumsy nature served to make most of them doubt her commitment to the cause of becoming an effective cheerleader. As the series progresses it can be seen that Kohane while certainly clumsy and not having much focus actually tries hard to not just master all of the techniques and knowledge that is needed to be an effective cheerleader but also endeavor to overcome one of the main weaknesses that she has that prevents her from being one. This determination to master both the techniques and knowledge that she needs to be an effective cheerleader as well as to master her inner fear I felt was well done and contributed greatly to changing not just the opinions of others towards her and the club but also in proving to herself that she too is capable of providing motivation to others by acting out her dream role of being a cheerleader. While Kohane’s determination to become a cheerleader may have sounded like a temporary goal for her in the beginning I thought that Kohane’s gradual development from a fangirl that only knew the basics about the main roles that they have to actually becoming a cheerleader after not just seeing but also experiencing all the training that they have to go through was done really well within the series and I really enjoyed seeing Kohane put all of this knowledge into practice in her attempts to fulfill the requests that were made on the club. The character of Kohane I felt was an interesting character that demonstrated well that if you have a strong enough reason to motivate you no task and role is beyond you. I felt that her seiyuu Yuka Ozaki did an excellent job portraying the character of Kohane. <br />
<br />
Kotetsu Tatejima <br />
<br />
Kotetsu Tatejima portrayed by Tomori Kusunoki of Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale online fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old girl and a classmate of Kohane Kotetsu on initial appearances can be seen to be a quiet, curious but nervous person by nature that tried hard to not stand out from the crowd. As a result of this quiet and nervous nature of hers, Kotetsu was also noted to have very low self-esteem and had great trouble in making her own views known to others as well as take the initiative on matters that genuinely interest her. This latter part is shown well in her struggle to both talk with Kohane and the members of the cheer club and her attempts to avoid them.  Despite her unwillingness to stand out from the crowd it’s surprising to note that Kotetsu possesses quite the talent for playing the piano and if she had overcome her nerves then such was her skill that she would have been able to make a career out of it. But alas this talent also proves to be a double-edged sword for her. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Kotetsu’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Kotetsu’s nervousness and low self-esteem is a side effect of the skills that she had developed in playing the piano. As a result of this Kotetsu while proud of her skills at playing the piano also possesses a deep fear within her and is fearfully afraid that if she reaches out to others and tries to bond with them these would all someday vanish. However, after seeing the kind of activities and training that the cheer club takes part in and seeing the effects that this has on the audience these doubts of hers gradually starts to vanish and Kotetsu while still hesitant to some degree begins to slowly move out of her shell and try to bond with Kohane and the others. While still easily flustered and constantly worried about her performance Kotetsu as the series goes on gradually starts to change as a result of seeing the hard work that the other members of the club show as they not just perform for their clients but also train hard to prepare for them. While still quiet to some degree Kotetsu gradually begins to take a more active role within the club trying hard to contribute to not just the meetings that the members attend but also work hard during both practice and during the actual performances. While still nervous at performing in front of people to a degree Kotetsu rather than shrink back in fear as she would have done previously instead finds strength from her friendships with the members of the club and tries hard to not let them down.  The character of Kotetsu I felt was an interesting one that did well in showing the kind of struggles that schoolgirls her age may encounter as they come to grips with society. In particular, I feel that Kotetsu’s core struggle which was her problems with her nerves and self-esteem and her journey to overcome this by learning to not just bond with others but also develop her confidence of being able to perform on stage was used really well here. Seeing Kotetsu gradually develop in confidence as she deepens the bonds that she has with her friends and improve the self-confidence that she had lacked at the beginning I thought was nice to see especially the realization that she isn’t alone in this endeavor and that her friends are standing beside her.  I felt that her seiyuu Tomori Kusunoki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kotetsu. <br />
<br />
Kana <br />
<br />
Kana Ushiku portrayed by Haruka Shiraishi of Aico incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and one of Arima’s classmates Kana on initial appearances can be seen to be a confident, perceptive and proud person by nature. However, while proud Kana at the beginning of the series was also noted to somewhat haughty in her attitude especially in the manner of which she interacted with Kohane and the members of the cheer club. This stems largely from the admiration and respect that she has towards Arima that comes from the shared past that existed between them in the past. As a result of this Kana’s relationship with Kohane and the members of the cheer, club was frosty at best. However, while her attitude can make it difficult to interact with her at times it can be seen that Kana is also someone that has a strong sense of responsibility and would not shirk from taking it when needed. This is best shown when she took Uki’s place during a performance to make up for her mistake. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Kana’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her proud nature Kana is someone that is caring by nature and does try to look out for others when she can. While her initial attitude towards Kohane and the rest of the club was harsh it can be seen that this was borne out of the respect and admiration that she has for Arima. As the series goes on and Kana begins to see the genuine fun and sense of happiness that Arima displays as she interacts with the members of the cheer club this antagonist attitude towards them gradually starts to soften. While still retaining the strong pride that defines her character Kana also starts to take steps to mend relations between her and the members of the club by joining them and showing them the skills that she managed to achieve in the past. While realizing that she cannot keep Arima to herself Kana also becomes determined to stand by her side and help bring the wishes of her into reality. As a character, I felt that Kana was an interesting one that did well to not only contrast the members of the club but also represent a link between Arima and the past and doing well to expand on her backstory. The gradual change of Kana’s attitude from a prideful and somewhat rude girl who was sure that she knew everything about her to one where she realized how little she knew as well as her attempts to mend relations between her and the members of the cheer club was something that I thought was done well with her character as it represented a significant shift in her personality as a result of the revelation that she experienced. <br />
<br />
Uki <br />
<br />
Uki Sawatari portrayed by Mikako Izawa is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student and a classmate of Kohane Uki on initial appearances is seen to be an intelligent, kind and perceptive person by nature that acts somewhat as a foil for Kohane and trying hard to rein in some of her more over the top decisions. A childhood friend and the guardian of Kohane Uki, unlike her esteemed charge, was seen to be an understanding, caring and rational person that despite the trouble that she causes her is shown to care deeply about her well being which is indicative of the deep bonds that exist between them.  <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Uki’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Uki also has struggles of her own that she tries hard to keep from her friends. At the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to have a deep fear of being seen as cute which I felt was rather amusing. Unlike Kohane and Arima at the beginning of the series, Uki was shown to not have much interest in cheerleading and indeed seemed rather averse to it. However, as the series goes on and Uki begins to see the kind of fun that Kohane and Arima have in both training and in actual performances this aspect of hers gradually starts to change. While initially hesitant about taking up the role due to the fact that she doesn’t want to be seen as cute and also because of how embarrassed the outfits are this aversion gradually vanishes as she comes to understand not just how much hard work goes into being a cheerleader but also how much of an effect it can have for those that are being cheered on. The character of Uki I felt was an interesting one that served well as one of the more rational members of the club and functioned well as a counterweight to Kohane’s mischief. In particular, I felt that her level-headed, and confident attitude contrasted rather well with her inner fear of being seen as cute by others. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hizume Arima <br />
<br />
Hizume Arima portrayed by new seiyuu Yuina Yamada is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the cheer club. A 15-year-old middle school student Hizume on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, kind and calm person who seemingly prefers to remain apart from her classmates. While an intelligent, level-headed and composed person that would no doubt be able to be popular if she made the attempt at the beginning of the series as a result of her wall Hizume was seen to be rather aloof for a mid-school girl and can be seen to be someone that trusts slowly and views others with something approaching wariness. As a result of this Hizume at the start was widely seen as being difficult to approach and as a result, had few if any friends within school until she met Kohane. While initially treating Kohane with an element of distrust thanks largely to Kohane’s persistent nature and her determined attempts to befriend her and learn about the sport of cheerleading this relationship gradually transformed into that of friendship something that had been utterly alien to Arima since her transfer. In the interactions that she has with Kohane, it can be seen that Hizume while a quiet person by nature was someone that was fast thinking, considerate and stoic and treated everything with utmost seriousness. This latter point is clearly shown in the training that she puts Kohane and the members of the cheer club through as here we can clearly see the care that she puts in as she carefully teaches them all the knowledge that they need to be effective cheerleaders. Despite her calm and composed nature, it can be surprising to see that Hizume can also get angry at times as well something that Kohane had the misfortune of encountering within the series. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and Hizume’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen beneath her quiet and aloof personality Hizume is actually a kind and gentle person by nature that will help those that are in need when needed. While initially wary of Kohane as the series goes on it can be seen that Hizume gradually grows to respect her a great deal because unlike her, she is able to stay positive and cheerful at all times and indeed she began to believe that she’s a natural at being a cheerleader. As a result of this high opinion towards her Hizume as the series goes on develops something of a soft spot for her and while still training her carefully and taking great care to make sure she actually understands the topics she also tries to balance it out by regulating the tension that comes from training by telling jokes a side to her that I felt was cute. As the series goes on however it can be seen that this strong bond that she enjoys with Kohane also has a flip side as well as it can be seen that despite her composed nature Hizume is surprisingly vulnerable to being alone as a result of the incidents that took place in the past and when placed in a situation in which she believes she will be left alone she will enter a depressed state something that I felt was amusing but at the same time indicative of the importance of the bond that exists between Hizume and Kohane. The character of Hizume I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. Her gradual evolution from a quiet, stoic and confident girl who pushed everyone away to someone that was not just kind, caring and attentive but more open with her feelings I thought was done really well. Seeing Hizume gradually overcome the trauma that she suffered in the past and learn to not just forge friendships with her classmates and members of the cheer club but also rediscover the joy that being a cheerleader can bring to her and to the people around her through their performances was something that I really enjoyed seeing. I felt that her seiyuu Yuina Yamada really did an excellent job portraying the character of Hizume. <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
Animation wise I felt that the series made great use of bright and clear animation that did well in showing the types of locations that the cast visit. At the same time, I also thought that this also did well in enhancing the various performances that the cast gives over the course of the series. The character designs for the girls as well as the designs for the uniforms in which they wear both in terms of school uniforms as well as the cheerleader uniforms I thought were really well done with the character designs doing a great job of differentiating the girls from each other and the cheerleader outfits showing the unity of the club. The various performances that the cheer club gives over the course of the series I thought were done well and were helped greatly by the varied types of stunts that were added in. <br />
<br />
In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Jump Up Yell and One for All which was both sung by Kaminoki Koukou Cheering Bu a unit that consists of the series main seiyuu’s of Yuka Ozaki, Yuina Yamada, Mikako Izawa, Tomori Kusunoki and Haruka Shiraishi. Both of these songs I felt were pretty catchy ones and resonated well with the series main premise of bringing cheer to others. In terms of voice acting, I felt that each of the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I feel that Yuka Ozaki, Mikako Izawa, Yuina Yamada, Tomori Kusunoki, and Haruka Shiraishi deserve special praise as I feel that they all did a fantastic job portraying the characters of Kohane, Uki, Hizume, Kotetsu, and Kana respectively. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall Anima yell was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strengths, in my opinion being its interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, a great fusion of comedy and learning experiences and excellent chemistry between the main characters. <br />
<br />
The overall premise of the show I felt was an interesting one as cheerleading as a subject matter has not been featured in anime before and as a result, this opportunity to see the kind of challenges and training that potential cheerleaders have to go through and the motivations that fuel them was an interesting experience. While the act of learning how to become a cheerleader served as one of the main themes for the premise that wasn’t all as the series also skillfully paired it with the development of each of the main characters and the many struggles that each girl struggles with as they take up the mantle of being a cheerleader. The overall story that makes use of such an interesting premise I felt was also a highlight of the series and I felt that it did a great job at showing not just the kind of developments that each girl goes through as they not only see the kind of things that cheerleaders have to learn as part of their duties but also see how such experiences aid in helping each of the girls overcome the personal struggles that each was struggling with. This last part was helped greatly by the requests that the cheer team undertakes over the course of the series all of which was well thought out and featured a surprising variety among them. Seeing the girls not just work hard to bring joy to their audiences in the performances but also in the process seeing the kind of effects that it has on the girls themselves I thought demonstrated this concept well. <br />
<br />
Overall Anima yell was an impressive anime that made great use of a unique premise, a great story that skillfully paired the main theme with the development of the main cast and a great blend of comedy and drama elements that’s backed by solid and cute animation and a relatively new but talented voice cast. In terms of final score, I would say that Anima Yell deserves a final score of 8/10.  <br />

    I don&#039;t get it. Where is the chair?<br />
<br />
After the major success of &#039;Bring it On&#039;, &#039;Ninja Cheerleaders&#039; and &#039;Fired Up!&#039;, it was only a matter of time until anime got its cheerleading series starred by cute girls, and it&#039;s cute, indeed.<br />
<br />
The cast is ridiculously energetic and excited about everything to a point that this thing has been fun to watch. The real mc is constantly standing out with her love for cheerleading that she discovered like 4 seconds ago. It&#039;s great to watch because she is so genuinely excited about it and has decided cheerleading is the best thing in the world. Even characters who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292840">
        do not really care about cheers are starting to see how effin amazing that thing is because she just likes it that goddamn much.<br />
<br />
Story wise, there actually isn&#039;t a cheerleading club in her school nor are there many persons who would want that even,  and the mc herself can&#039;t even do the thing itslf because she is ridiculously afraid of heights, but soon there will be and everyone will want and she also can because that&#039;s what type of a series this is. The series is pretty comedic since it&#039;s based to a 4-koma gag comedy manga. Most of the comedy serves the cuteness and so far this has been a pleasant surprise. <br />
<br />
Production-wise, the voice acting is ridiculously fitting to this work and the art is quite fluffy and warm. The mc&#039;s face constantly keeps turning into a chicken&#039;s peak and whenever she talks about chairleeding, there is a visualization of a chair shown because it is really important. The art is simple, but efficiently presenting the things that need to stand out. There aren&#039;t many comedy series airing this season, so this one is worth of giving a try to for that reason alone. <br />
<br />
*There is a running gag in the series where the mc constantly mispronounces chee as chair, for those who didn&#039;t get the beginning of this review. <br />

    Occasionally you start to wonder whether everything that comes out today is just a rehash of something older, and to some degree, this is true. Most ideas that exist have already been used in the past, so for shows to break the mold they either have to do something very well, or do something niche enough to where people don&#039;t notice it as much. Anima Yell follows the latter by using cheerleading as the focus point, something I&#039;m sure many of you haven&#039;t seen much of before. However, is a niche idea enough to make it stand out? Let&#039;s take a look.<br />
<br />
The first thing you&#039;ll

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296662">
        notice when watching Anima Yell is the obvious enthusiasm coming from the girls as they passionately cheer (or chair as they like to pronounce it) on. This energy level keeps the entire show fun and cheerful for the most part. Throughout the show, Kohane joins up with and cheers with other girls with similar ambitions to her. Throw in a beach ep after eight or so episodes and you&#039;ve got yourself a classic cute girls doing cute things anime. Standard affairs such as them having to overcome slight hardships and a happy conclusion is contained within Anima Yell.<br />
<br />
The characters are one of my bigger gripes with this show; they feel very distant in a way. As the show progressed, even though they started to develop, I couldn’t help but feel a lack of connection to them, so their development payoff didn’t end up affecting me as much as it should have. They stay consistent for the entirety of the show though, so if you don&#039;t have the same problem as I had, you should like them a lot.<br />
<br />
As far as the art goes, it’s nice to look at and the girls are cute. The girls have funny facial expressions when in the middle of a skit of theirs, which adds to the overall cuteness. The sound is decent, fitting tracks play when they need to, and the voice acting is solid.<br />
<br />
Overall, Anima Yell tries to be different by using cheerleading as its selling point, but it succumbs to the average nature these shows tend to fall under after a while unless they excel in something, which I didn’t see Anima Yell doing. Nevertheless, it was a fun watch and I can recommend it to people who are a fan of cute girls doing cute things shows.<br />

    So Doga Kubo the studio that brought you such Moe titles as: Yuru Yuri and Gabriel Dropout...Brings you another fun girls comedy with Anima Yell!<br />
<br />
This a simple story, the main protagonist Kohane wants to do something that helps people, and discovers cheerleading. Hoping the new high school she goes to has a club, it doesn&#039;t, she starts one of her own with her frend Uki and cheerleading veteran Hizume who is a bit of a school idol. The characters have their own personalities and are very enjoyable to follow to see if they can get their cheerleading club off the ground and actually help the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294768">
        school not with just school spirit but sometimes just talking and listening.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a cute Sunday morning anime that you can laugh and enjoy without very much thought. But sometimes that&#039;s all you want. The characters have lots of similarities to previous Doga Kubo works but that&#039;s what makes them easy to love. If you want to chill out and watch something funny and simple this is a perfect choice for Fall 2018. Lovely show 8/10

    Yet another cute girls doing cute things show, so what makes this one so different? Well, it’s about chair- I mean cheerleading, and it pulls off some very nice yuri relationships.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Starting with the characters, unique to this series is that each character’s name features an animal pun. We have Kohane, the most energetic of the group, who loves helping others but is also afraid of heights, she’s represented as a bird, Uki, who acts tomboyish but secretly likes cute things (including Kohane), is represented by a monkey. Then you have Hizume, a former cheerleader who can be incredibly serious and dense, but her character does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295784">
        a complete 180 when she starts cheerleading. She’s represented by a horse, and if you didn’t notice, yes, she wears a horseshoe as a hairclip. Kotetsu often says what’s on her mind without thinking and keeps an eye on her weight, she’s represented as a tiger. Finally, we have Kana, an initially shy girl who turns out to just really admire Hizume (seeing all the yuri yet?). She’s represented by a cow. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
So, you’ve got a wonderfully vibrant cast brought to life through Doga Kobo’s animation, the studio who have brought you shows such as the wonderful Yuru Yuri. The cheerleading sequences in this show are surprisingly well animated, although they generally don’t last very long. One thing I have to give credit to the animators for is that all these sequences are done traditionally. Yup, there’s no bad CG plaguing this show despite what you would think from a show involving dancing. The comedy in this series is generally visual comedy, so it helps that the animators know when to pull out all the stops, and also when to dial it back and simplify the characters a bit. One of the great jokes in the first episode is about Kohane mistaking the word cheer for chair. It’s stupid yes, but it works. The animal puns are followed through as well, with Kohane often going into a bird-like state.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
Now, you can’t talk about cheerleading without talking about the music and man you’ve got some jams in here. I’d never really thought about cheerleading until watching this show, but you would think that any show involving dancing would need some convincing tunes, and Anima Yell has exactly that. Each insert song that accompanies a cheer performance is wonderfully energetic, and just like the cheerleaders, I wasn’t able to wipe the smile off of my face. Same goes for the opening and ending which I haven’t skipped once, unlike other shows. Also, in episode 5, there’s an excellent transition into the ending song, and that’s one of my favourite things in anime period. It works even better here because the song doesn’t just start up randomly, the characters are actually doing a cheer performance to the song.<br />

Yuri Respect:<br />
Yuri anime has been growing a lot in the industry, with shows like Bloom Into You and Citrus heavily focusing on Yuri, and shows like Comic Girls and even Darling in the Franxx having yuri subplots or recognizing yuri relationships. Anima Yell handles this topic extremely well, particularly in episode 3, and treats yuri relationships like a normal thing, as it should be. The characters are completely respectful upon hearing a fellow student has feelings for another girl because it’s just such an innate thing for them to do. Within the main cast it is laid out that Uki has feelings for Kohane, although this is used more for comedy, and that Kana has feelings for Hizume. This relationship is built up much more, with more than one episode focusing on it. Episode 10 in particular focuses the most heavily on the two’s relationship, depicting Kana’s shyness and over-the-top respect towards Hizume, and Hizume’s struggle to understand Kana’s feelings due to how Kana is unable to calm down around her. Unlike other shows that bait you with relationships that never go anywhere, Anima Yell is very clear in telling you, that yes, love is in the air, and whilst the story obviously isn’t going to go in any serious romantic direction, it’s nice that the characters feelings are taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Story/The Power of Cheer:<br />
After learning the basics and being prepared to cheer, the basic formula of the series follows the cast of characters as they accept cheerleading requests. These range from anything as informal as cheering one on to confess, to formal events such as a basketball or soccer game, or a stage performance. Anima Yell’s strength lies in the power of these performances. They turn out to have such a motivational an influential impact on those who are being cheered for, and in the basketball team’s case, the cheer is used as a good luck charm, as they request a cheer performance a second time due to the fact that they won their prior game after they had been cheered on. The club eventually cheers at Uki’s younger brother’s soccer game, changing his perception of the people who cheer him on in the process. The power of cheer affects not only those being cheered, but also the cheerleaders themselves. Kohane at first has trouble recruiting both Uki and Kotetsu into the club and Kana also initially refuses to join, but after they see the pure happiness and energy emanating from the cheer performances, they decide to join in the hopes that they too can experience that feeling.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
In a year full of Devilman Crybaby’s and Goblin Slayers’, as well the stresses of life in general, it’s nice to have a show to look forward to each week that just makes me inexplicably happy. I wasn’t expecting much from this show, and it’s really blown me away. It goes to show you really can’t judge an anime by how it looks or by its (criminally low) MAL score. It’s been a fantastic year for anime, with Violet Evergarden, A Place Further Than The Universe, Yuru Camp, and the previously mentioned Devilman Crybaby all not only being some of the best anime of the year, but some of the best anime I’ve ever seen. And while I wouldn’t say Anima Yell reaches the high’s of those shows, it was special to me in its own little way. I guess you could say I now know the power of chair - I mean cheer.

    Kohane Hatoya can never do anything for herself, I&#039;m saying this in a negative sense though. Kohane has always loved to help others out, the byproduct of that mindset is that she never strives to do things for herself. That all changed shortly before her start of high school upon seeing a middle school cheerleading team in action. Unfortunately, her new school doesn&#039;t have a cheer team, naturally this doesn&#039;t stop her from attempting to create her own. Her first task is to of course gather up some teammates, and what better person to start asking for help then one of the cheerleaders that was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329993">
        on the very same team that inspired her in the first place. A surprisingly good moe comedy awaits you, ready to cheer you up in more ways than one!<br />
<br />
There were a number of cute girls doing cute things anime that I had tried and dropped or thought little of during 2018, Anima Yell! was one of them. 2018 was a very interesting year in that regard, because Just like Anima Yell! shows like Mitsuboshi Colors, Comic Girls, and my personal favorite Harukana Receive, are all anime I had little exceptions of. Only to then come crawling back to them and praising their entertainment value, followed by calling myself an idiot for not realizing sooner. Anima Yell! on that note has come back to haunt me here in 2020, and I&#039;m more than okay with that, here&#039;s why.<br />
<br />
Anima Yell! is a really upbeat comedy, and promotes positivity at every opportunity through jokes and the subject of cheering itself in a way that feels genuine and humble. All the credit for accomplishing such a narrative goes to the characters, who are so fun and more layered than you&#039;d expect from a moe comedy anime. When we are introduced to them, it&#039;s easy to view them as your typical collection of anime girl archetypes. The genki girl, the kuudere, the shy one, etc etc. To my surprise though, as Anima Yell! progressed, it used not just it&#039;s dialogue, but also it&#039;s humor to better demonstrate the character&#039;s overall personality. Some of those jokes also happen to be very self-aware and/or include rather blunt responses, expanding the character&#039;s nature and habits further. A surprising hint of depth to say the least, hilarious in practice for comedy to say the most! Aside from the great varied comedy, the cheerleading aspects are easy to understand, and that recurring theme of encouragement stays strong from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
Looking back, many other cute girls doing cute things anime are always fun to have around. At times though it&#039;s hard to find the ones out of the hundreds if not thousands that are worth our time. I myself, despite dedicating a lot of time to watch anime weekly, and being a fan of moe anime in general, find it hard to fit in that one extra anime in my queue. After all the time and effort though, it&#039;s 100% worth it. The light hearted fun, lovable characters, boisterous laughs, and overwhelming positivity anime like Anima Yell! offer me will always be worth it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so glad I gave Anima Yell! a second chance.

    I finished this anime recently and I was thinking of reviewing it. Then I visit Anima Yell&#039;s page on mal and I see that it only has 4/5 reviews? What?!! It deserves more! So here goes mine.<br />
<br />
Story: So you know those anime&#039;s that have cute girl doing cute things? This is one of them and it&#039;s not disappointing at all. The story is simple, easy to follow and short. Sadly, it only has 12 episodes and the story couldn&#039;t move further, but we still got to see the character&#039;s friendship evolve and the adding of a new character almost at the end of the show.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308545">
        Yet, there aren&#039;t many cheerleading animes, so at some point it was original and out of the ordinary! I give it a 7. <br />
<br />
Art: The art was really nice, yet I feel like sometimes it lacked some animation, even with the cheerleading dances! Those scenes were still good and it made me wanna cheer too! It&#039;s an 8 from me. <br />
<br />
Sound: Both the OP and the ED were amazing, catchy and super kawaii! I was super happy to see that when Kana&#039;s character was added they also added her in the opening/ending! C-H-E-E-R! Deserves a solid 8.<br />
<br />
Characters: All the characters were amazing and with an unique sense of humour. I do see myself a little bit like Kohane: she&#039;s clumsy, innocent, kind and sweet! She&#039;s my fav character of this anime. The only character I did not like was Kana, because she was really getting on my nerves with the &quot;senpai&quot; thingy. I give it a 7!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I loved this anime. It is sweet, cute, short and funny. The humour was good and it made me laugh every episode. Wish It was longer and we could see the improvement of the Cheer Club, since in the tournament they were still doing &quot;basic&quot; cheer stunts and didn&#039;t pass in to the semi-finals. Hopefully there will be a season 2! 9 &lt;3<br />
<br />
GO! FIGHT! WIN!<br />

    (This review may contain spoilers. Please don&#039;t read this until you&#039;ve finished watching the series.)<br />
<br />
For those who&#039;ve checked out what I&#039;m into, I&#039;m a big Precure fan and one of the seasons I&#039;ve watched is the legendary Hugtto Precure. The main character for that show is designed with the cheerleader motif in mind and would become one of my favorite characters.<br />
<br />
So, when I saw another show that&#039;s ALL about Cheerleading, I&#039;m all for it. And wow, I was not expecting this.<br />
<br />
Anima Yell looks like just another slice of life anime to the average viewer, but personally, this anime was great! For once, an anime that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363026">
        I was pumped up for until the very end, haven&#039;t had that feeling in a long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
The story of Anima Yell is quite basic and in typical slice of life fashion. Our protagonist, Kohane, one day saw the amazing sight that is cheerleading. She was immediately hooked and wanted to start her own Cheer Club at school. Over time, she recruited our other parts of the cast whom she&#039;d become great friends with- Hizume, Uki, Kotetsu, and Kana. They have some good ol&#039; cheerleading fun and learning more about it in the process.<br />
I&#039;ve had my share of slice of life animes in the past, but most of them feel as if you don&#039;t really have to watch every episode to watch any given episode. But with Anima Yell, it felt different. Maybe it&#039;s just I&#039;ve been learning more about how anime works in general in the past year, but Anima Yell is structured in a way that gives quite decent development to the crew and to each character, allowing the story to be considerably consistent and more enjoyable since I get to watch the cast grow, both as individuals and as a cheerleading squad.<br />
I like how the series tried to break stereotypes people have about cheerleading. For example, both Uki and Kotetsu originally found cheerleading embarrassing (And I do admit it kind of is, given I have been forced to do it before,) but after Kohane and Hizume show them the ropes and what it&#039;s all about, they were hooked. It sort of gives off a vibe that some things aren&#039;t as stupid as you think, like how in episode 9, where Uki&#039;s brother had the impression originally when his sister had to cheer for him, and ending up being more passive about it.<br />
The progression of the plot was very gradual and interconnecting, something that I have rarely seen in the genre thus far, making Anima Yell very intriguing and great to watch for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
The animation style for Anima Yell was nothing new, really, but the way they animate each character was important as this anime is quite an active one for obvious reasons, and they nailed it in my opinion. They also took the time to compliment the many comedic jokes and scenes throughout the series with hilarious facial expressions and special effects which I think add a nice touch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
In most animes, I don&#039;t really know how to judge this category, but this time I know from the get-go to give this a 10 because I can&#039;t believe the producers managed to make so many cool and catchy tunes just for the sake of the several performances in the show! It really livens up the atmosphere and even gets viewers like me going.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
To start, we are of course going to talk about Kohane. Kohane is a bright girl with a great passion for helping others and, of course, cheering them on. Throughout the series, Kohane never deviated from her cute cheery self unless the plot provides her the situation to, but outside of that, she learns throughout the series what it truly means to be a cheerleader and what makes the role so special.<br />
Hizume is up next and it almost feels like, toward the end of the series, she became the main character as we start connecting her to her past head-on. She was afraid of her obliviousness in terms of socializing with others causing her to become isolated, and she has been criticized for it. But in working together with Kohane and the others, she learned to open herself up to both others and cheer as a whole.<br />
Uki, Kotetsu, and Kana joined midway, and they showed interesting growth with themselves by joining the Cheer Club as well, breaking their initial skepticism with cheer (Uki and Kotetsu), and getting to bond with those she holds dear (Kana.) You can start to see a trend that the show wants to help each character build a learning curve for cheer and for their personal growth, and I think this show did a really great job on it. If anything, I wish Anima Yell could be a 24 episode series instead of 12.<br />
The only nitpick I have is related to that last part- The story can get a bit too focussed on Kohane and Hizume&#039;s development. If we had more to see for the other three, maybe what I just mentioned could give off an even greater result!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
As a fan of the magical girl titan that is Precure, I enjoy flashy things and things that could get me bouncing in my chair.<br />
This anime does that, and my expectations were blown away just from the first episode. The story is very colorful and filled with life, and is one of the few shows I&#039;ve seen so far except Precure, where I would be pumped up and excited to continue watching from where I left off, for the entire season.<br />
Any story that could get me excited about it from beginning to end is a good story in my book, that&#039;s what I think.<br />
The show also had great humor and lovely character interactions that make my heart very warm. I enjoyed the show from beginning to end, and couldn&#039;t stop smiling. (Unless the show throws out some awkward situation. That I can&#039;t help with.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.1/10<br />
<br />
Anima Yell is a story filled with wonder. I could watch it while I&#039;m bored with nothing to do, or I could watch it if I ever need something to cheer myself up. That&#039;s what the series wants to do- To give cheers to all its fans. And with all that said, I think this anime is something that I feel like living through all over again anytime in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, please don&#039;t just take my word for it, go see what others think too! (This is the first time I reviewed an anime that is not Precure, after all.)

    I was really excited for Anima Yell before the season began. A slice of life/comedy about cheerleading? I’m all in, that’s something that hasn’t really been done in anime. Now that I’ve finished it, I can safely say that my excitement kind of paid off. While it wasn’t anything spectacular, it still hit all the beats of a good slice of life anime. There’s nothing to really dislike about it, but there’s nothing there to make you want to sing praise for it either. The characters were all likable, their designs were cute, their interactions were fun and enjoyable, and they all fit specific character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296670">
        archetypes, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. On one end, you’ve seen these types of characters again and again in other slice of life anime. At the same time, it’s not like these character types are bad or unlikable, they just lack uniqueness. At the end of the day, Anima Yell is a very normal slice of life. It’s solid, but nothing you haven’t seen before unless you’re really into seeing some cheerleading. The practices and dance routines were interesting and something I wish they went a bit more into. There is ONE scene in particular that is worth seeing alone in episode 3. Despite not being a full Yuri or Yaoi anime, there was a genuine coming out scene from a character. Sadly, it’s never expanded upon or referenced again. In fact, the rest of the show uses Yuri as a comedic device instead of being straightforward and serious like it did once before. It doesn’t detract from the overall enjoyment, but I would’ve loved to see more of these moments. The art was good, but could’ve been better in certain scenes. The music is definitely a highlight for me, I don’t think I’ll stop listening to the opening and ending anytime soon. I’d also love to see a second season that expands on the cheerleading club with more advanced techniques. There’s a lot of hidden potential, but I do feel like this is a one and done anime seasonal.

    If you just want to watch an anime about cute girls doing cute things, Anima Yell would be perfect for you. This series is essentially YuruYuri but with cheer outfits on. For anyone looking for a series to get deeply invested in, you may be a little disappointed. Personally, I love these kinds of series but Anima Yell fell flat for me for a few reasons. <br />
1. The series is insanely trope driven, especially in terms of the types of characters included and how they’re developed (which isn’t much development at all compared to other sports series).<br />
2. The plot is a little all over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339069">
        place in terms of the overall goal the girls want to achieve. First, it was to cheer people on. After, it’s just to have fun. Then, it’s to cheer in a large competition (while having mediocre skills) just to prove to Arima’s team that she’s doing well after being kicked off. For the plot to be worthwhile, they should’ve took a page out of Sound! Euphonium’s book and strives for the contest from the get-go, even if it was to just have fun and not win or qualify for other competitions.<br />
3. I hoped that this series would start a conversation about realistic competitive cheer like Haikyuu does volleyball. However, this show is geared toward people who would otherwise have no interest in the sport and just want to see high school girls flounce around in small outfits as opposed to showing the greater sides of cheerleading- teamwork, sportsmanship, technique, history, etc. Obviously, none of this was to be expected but it would’ve been nice if the show took this turn.<br />
<br />
Overall, I honestly don’t think it’s a bad show. It serves the purpose of brightening the audiences mood and giving us cute characters to cheer on while they try their best at the sport of cheer. I think it’s a fun watch especially for people who like moe anime and I’d recommend it for that reason. Otherwise, it’s just alright and not really worth a rewatch in my opinion. I don’t think I’m going to read the manga because the anime didn’t advertise the story well enough but if you liked the characters and want to see what happens next, go for it.

    This series has a charm that few have, and that is how to make a cheerleading anime entertaining and good, the protagonist is one of the funniest and most beautiful I&#039;ve seen, the rest of the characters also have their interesting and entertaining moments, In itself it has much more comedy than anything else and there are moments where the yuri appears but in very mild ways, as to what the series really goes, which is the desire to be a cheerleader to be happy etc, many of his acts visually felt uncomfortable since only background music was heard while they danced, * for those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322113">
        of us who watched the series, they certainly felt the same * maybe it is the only point against a series that does not seek to offer more than just and necessary entertainment
