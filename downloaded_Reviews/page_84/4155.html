    Right, this is my second review. I&#039;ll try to control myself on length this time. Take note that I&#039;ll update the review at the end of the series. Additionally, no summary will be provided. This anime&#039;s main page has a brilliant one already. So, off we go.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10):<br />
The story extremely interesting in the sense that it evolves from small incidents to macrosmic effects. In the first few episodes, one couldn&#039;t really tell where the story was going, who the main characters were and just what was going to happen next. However, slowly, but surely the dam broke and plot flowed to swamp us. We are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5665">
        placed in an out of Japan setting with the familiar plot of demons rising to attack humanity, but suddenly we can&#039;t be sure whether that&#039;s all there is to it. I look forward to seeing it grow as the recent episodes seem to hold an extremely promising future for this series.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10):<br />
I never really like Gonzo&#039;s animation. Sure its pretty, but somehow there are some times you wish it didn&#039;t do that. The artwork of Blassreiter is clear. The settings are quite well done, living up to standards of being set in a small German town. The Demoniacs, however, really don&#039;t fit to my taste. The designs look good, until they&#039;re in action. Well, most of the protagonist designs look good (Examples include Gerd and Joseph) But,(spoiler) Malek&#039;s demoniac armor looks really....ugh...at times (end of spoiler). Nevertheless, the action scenes are generally well done, if a bit confused. Most of you&#039;ll enjoy it, but don&#039;t expect Last Exile or Gankutsuou level animation or artwork.<br />
<br />
Sound (6/10):<br />
Perhaps the weakest point in the series. Both OP and ED are really good, particularly the ED (first time, I ever downloaded an anime ending of Gendou). However, the soundtrack in between isn&#039;t really significant. You&#039;re usually too engrossed in the storyline to even notice the sound. Vocal acting meets most of the standards of the series, but ain&#039;t to my taste. It might be to yours, though.<br />
<br />
Character (10/10):<br />
This series&#039;s characters are hands down one of the most realistic and powerfully depicted personalities this season. You may think I&#039;m lying, but I&#039;m not. You will learn to HATE Jill Hoffman. You will feel Malek&#039;s pain even though you may not have lost someone close to you. You may find yourself questioning Gerd&#039;s intentions and wondering just who the hell Beatrice is. Development of characters is rapid, but also realistic. There personalities may not be thoroughly distinct, but you will find that they may be like one of you: A sister in confusion about her brother&#039;s actions or a disillusioned man trying revive his hero&#039;s faith or a lone wolf watching from afar, living day by day for revenge. Sounds far fetched, but see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10):<br />
Blassreiter managed to keep me awake until 3 am (where I&#039;m living anyway) every Saturday or Sunday, just to get a chance to see a new episode. I am enjoying the series quite a bit. It beats your general run-of-the-mill shonen that gets over 200 episodes, but barely achieves anything in that time a million times over. It&#039;s sad that this must end at 24 episodes, but then again, maybe its one of those animes that have to end there. Those are generally the good ones.<br />
<br />
Overall (8/10):<br />
Whew, I thought this was going to short. I&#039;m glad if you&#039;ve read this far. My advice to you is, don&#039;t look at the top anime score. That&#039;s what people thought when they watched the first couple episodes. This is a heavily underrated series and I hope that this review convinces you to watch it too. Thank you for reading.

    Blassreiter is not among the highest rated animes on MAL, and for a reason.<br />
<br />
But that reason has nothing to do with any supposed inferiority of the series, nor is it about any glaring fault in the show - Blassreiter is a good anime. It&#039;s also understandable why many haven&#039;t considered it great, or not even all that good.<br />
<br />
The biggest fault in the show is it&#039;s seemingly lack of any clear direction or plot. In the first few episodes we see a bunch of these weird, robot-ish, human-like creatures running around causing havoc, including turning a motorcyclist idol into one of them. Along with the infected

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26520">
        Gerd Frentzen the other main cast of Amanda Werner, a hot pinkette with a cool and professional attitude, her hot-headed partner Hermann Saltza, and the dark and mysterious Joseph Jobson, whose unimpressive screen time at the beginning of the show wouldn&#039;t at first suggest him to be a main cast member.<br />
<br />
As many of you may have already figured out from the short descriptions above, a cast of unique and compelling characters is not one of the show&#039;s merits. Amanda is again one of your typical strong female-type of character whose usually calm and collected at her job, but, oh so surprisingly, is capable of showing a good bout of defiance and passion when it comes to her loved ones and what she sees as just. Hermann is almost her polar opposite, doing his job with personal feelings constantly at the surface and always, quite loudly if I may add, questioning his orders when they contradict his sense of right and wrong. Joseph is there to heavily add on the show&#039;s gloom and doom with his brooding air of a misunderstood hero who secretly fights for the good guys despite everyone thinking of him as a villain.<br />
<br />
A good portion of the show&#039;s dark air stems from the characters&#039; feel of guilt and responsibility over, well, various things. Amanda feels she hasn&#039;t been quite the big sis she should&#039;ve been for her adopted brother Malek (the angsty crybaby), Sasha for creating some pretty damn advanced technology that just got used the wrong way, Joseph for pretty much everything, and so on. The constant, over-the-top blaming for one&#039;s self over matters beyond their control is nothing new in fictional characters who&#039;re supposed to appear heroic; an aspect that sure as hell isn&#039;t any less annoying in Blassreiter. On more than one occasion I found myself cringing at the characters&#039; angsty antics, which did little to help the show&#039;s enjoyability.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mature storyline&quot;, boasts the show&#039;s summary. As the show goes on it becomes evident that by mature, they mean shitty. Not the storyline itself, but rather the pasts and circumstances of each character. Shit seems to be the share of especially the poor and foreign folk in the show&#039;s fictional German society. We see this through Malek and Joseph, mainly, who both have been the target of some truly hideous cruelty for no other reason than that they&#039;re not as well-off as the people around &#039;em. The series does make a powerful attempt at gaining the viewers&#039; sympathies for the characters by showing us in great detail and abundance the torment they&#039;ve been through. Unfortunately some of this effort was lost on me, for the &quot;harsh reality&quot; card being played as clumsily as it sometimes was in this anime has a way of making me laugh rather than weep. Sure the poor have always been looked down on at some level, but come on. A poor kid getting beat up by a rich one time and again to ensure his church keeps getting donations, and in a modern society no less? Okay.<br />
<br />
In the same vein of showing how crappy the world is for some, Blassreiter seems to take every chance it gets to jab at Christianity. Shit happens, people pray, and God does nothing. Blah blah blah. Never think of me as a vigorously religious person, but to me nowadays trashing religion is like most of black metal. Immature and silly. Perhaps I&#039;m just too sensitive about the Japanese trying to depict the western way of life or something.<br />
<br />
So why, after all this bitching, do I think Blassreiter was good, you ask? Short answer: it just was. The longer one? Well...<br />
<br />
On the occasions I actually bothered to tune it on (I&#039;m a rather lazy anime watcher nowadays), Blassreiter kept me entertained. It wasn&#039;t an anime that rushed through its plot 1000000mph, but let the events roll at their own pace. It&#039;s not like I would especially mind fast-paced anime (TTGL ftw), but I do tend to appreciate it when a story takes its time to tell whatever story it has to tell. And though Blassreiter went through its story at a moderate pace, it didn&#039;t exactly lapse into sluggishness either; there was something going on in each episode to keep the viewer on their toes. Also the complete turnover the series takes around halfway through was, though sudden, an interesting twist.<br />
<br />
The artwork of Blassreiter is also worth mentioning here on the plus-side, even with the fact that most anime is a parade of eye-candy. The machinery depicted in the anime is generally really neat looking, though flying motorbikes and such quirks tended to appear more amusing than cool. A big hand to the character designs as well; I could stare at Amanda&#039;s shiny green eyes and luscious lips forever. Also, I hope you like cleavage shots. You&#039;ll be having a hard time watching Blassreiter if you don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Though I spent a good while beating on the show&#039;s forced realism with cruelty, the aspect does accentuate the fact that Blassreiter is not your heap of moe-blob BS. Which is always a plus in my book. And no matter how much I&#039;d think that gluttoning with harshness is just plain lame, a scene of a poor boy confessing crimes he didn&#039;t do with his hand on a bible while the true culprits sneer around him did clutch my innards. Always a good sign for an anime to be able to do that.<br />
<br />
So yeah. Wanna see a solid, serious anime that&#039;ll keep you entertained till the end but with which you don&#039;t have to fear it&#039;ll shatter the earth below you? Grab Blassreiter.

    All right, this is to be my first anime review for myanimelist.net so inexperience is to be expected:)<br />
<br />
Blassreiter or &quot;Pale rider&quot; is newest addition to list of Gonzo&#039;s works (done in collaboration with Nitro+). Elements of contemporary anime are clearly shown in this series like extensive use of CGI, futuristic setting focusing on technological advances and moral/ethic consequences arising from it degrading humanity in process. This could be summarised as the main theme of series around which plot revolves. Classical motives of redemption, friendship, duty, loyalty and love are also present in the plot driving character actions in certain way or other.<br />
<br />
Story in short revolves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12728">
        around nanomachine virus spreading across Germany infecting humans which after infection become Demoniacs-demon like creatures stripped of humanity. Although premise isn&#039;t new or epochal it is executed great with many twists and turns keeping tension high. Only a few anime could do that &quot;I must watch next episode...NOW!&quot; feeling. Melancholy, dramatic, painful and tragic elements are indeed intensive spicing things up and stirring viewers emotions. Great!<br />
<br />
Now onto characters! They are truly the stars of this show! I humbly think that everyone could find some character he could establish a bond with! Driven by their inner thoughts, wishes and their past they are diverese but also sharing common concepts like grief, burden and friendship. All I can say further without spoiling something is: superb!<br />
<br />
Art, although debated is IMHO a milestone! Great presentation, action sequences, camera angles, design of characters and tech stuff like vehicles, mechas... Demoniacs are done entirely in CG which is quite nice giving their details and crazy fight scenes it couldn&#039;t be pulled off by a conventional animation! Now i think also it is a matter of taste, especially art&amp;design (some love e. g. Miyazaki or some other style and some don&#039;t but it has no implications on quality of that style whatsoever). Quality in Blassreiter is evident! Excellent!<br />
<br />
Music. Highest grades here also! Strong soundtrack was a pure enjoyment beginning from opening themes (&quot;Unripe Hero&quot; was one of the best I&#039;ve heard in a long time) and great moving battle action backgrounds, through character themes (Xargin theme&#039;s also one of best ever composed, heights achieved by  the ones of like Aeris theme from FFVII). &quot;Wish for the stars&quot; was beautiful and fitted perfectly! Overall: great! <br />
<br />
In the end...enjoyment review. While not a masterpiece (although short by a little in my standards) this series won&#039;t disappoint! Fans of quality action SF anime will (should) be pleased as I think will majority who decides to dive into Blassreiter&#039;s world! As far as I&#039;m concerned Blassreiter will always be high in my book being one of my top 10!<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!

    Right, Blassreiter.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t really expect much going into this, and I have to say that was a good thing.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t take me wrong, there were a few times where this show actually shined, but aside from those times, it felt mostly boring.<br />
<br />
Many characters felt somewhat predictable (with the exception of Amanda, but that&#039;s mostly because after a bit of development she remains the same for the entirety of the show...).<br />
<br />
As a positive note, they did focus on many characters (which is nice if you like a diverse cast).<br />
<br />
While watching the episodes, you&#039;ll soon notice something quite annoying, which may be a minor point to some of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203077">
        you, but it may also make you *sigh* because there&#039;s no point to it.<br />
<br />
There are some intervals during the half of each episode, it&#039;s just a splash scene with some of the characters and some sound, however, the music played here is bad (specially during the 2nd half of the series), and this also servers no point. It&#039;s just a useless gimmick.<br />
<br />
Something I thought I should say - I usually have a very high tolerance to the shows I pick to watch, even if they are bad, and I usually marathon them. However, with Blassreiter, I found myself wanting to do other things and simply not come back to it.<br />
<br />
One last thing before I continue, there is gore on this anime, and the general theme is grim.<br />
<br />
Now that I got that out of the way, let me go over some specific points (art, sound etc).<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The music is mediocre IMO. The OP and ED are forgettable, and I found myself skipping over them after the very first episode. This is not to mention the 2nd OP/ED, which are even worse. Sound effects are okaysih, nothing to praise or hate. I have to mention yet again the cringey splash screen which you&#039;ll be seeing every episode (not too bad during the first 12 episodes, but gets ridiculous later on).<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
<br />
This is the first thing you&#039;ll notice, and if you&#039;re like me, this will bother you a lot -<br />
<br />
BAD CGI. Now, when I say bad, it&#039;s really bad. The art assets animated through CGI seem like something you&#039;d see in a 1998&#039;s movie or so, it&#039;s glaring and annoying. Of course, art isn&#039;t the end all be all of anime, many more seasoned anime viewers know this, but for a show that doesn&#039;t really deliver anything special on many fronts, this is a big problem. I&#039;d much have preferred traditional animation here but ah well... The only good thing I can say about the art is what I already said earlier, there&#039;s very diverse set of characters, so you&#039;ll most likely find one you can identify with.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giving this a 7/10 for creativity, the premise is something I hadn&#039;t seen before, even though you&#039;ll find some cliches here and there. The problem is, there isn&#039;t anything new in the way it was executed, in fact it was quite predictable who would turn out to be a bad/good guy, when someone would sacrifice him/herself etc.<br />
<br />
Also - the ending felt rushed in some ways, but I don&#039;t want to go into much detail because I&#039;m not really sure how to convey what I mean with this without spoiling it, so I&#039;ll leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t enjoy this that much. It was so-so, but there were times when I wasn&#039;t really sure I could endure it for much longer, and I just wanted to play games/study do something else instead of watching it.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Overall, this wasn&#039;t actually bad, but it also wasn&#039;t good. Which is why I&#039;m giving it an overall score of 6/10.<br />
<br />
If you have nothing else to watch, then maybe you should pick this up, given that you are willing to deal with bad soundtracks/CGI/gore, if not, then don&#039;t even come close to this one.<br />
<br />
I hope this review was helpful to you, thanks for reading, and sorry about any grammar mistakes!

    Story 9/10: its a great plot showing the struggles of people and how they can be led to many horrible decisions or tricked. The only complaint I had was that in the beginning it was hard to discover who the main characters were, I cant say anything about this without spoiling it though so that concludes story. There are also many twists, turns, and &amp;quot;Oh Snap&amp;quot; moments to be had in the story of Blassreiter.<br />
Art 8/10: While the CGI could be better it shouldnt be the deciding point of wether the anime is good. CGI helped the anime alot since it allowed the action to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6578">
        be more fast-paced and allowed them to put in very nice camera angles. The traditional animation is also very good the scenes are well animated.<br />
Sound 7/10: The songs for the openings and endings are some of the greatest i have heard. SFX is also very good, the voice acting is so superb that if you listened to it without watching you might think they were real.<br />
But the series is lacking very much on battle-style music during the show.<br />
While the dramatic music is very good there is little music for action sequences and if there are they are very short-lived.<br />
Character 10/10: You couldn&#039;t ask for a more realistic cast of characters. From the troubled,sorrowful lives of some to the happy lives of others, every character reacts to their situation as a real person would. They also express their emotions as a human would. It also realistically displays how some cant see past the wall of differences and come together (Spoiler) such as how citizens view others who are poor or suffering as &amp;quot;outcasts&amp;quot; and tend to beat them. Such is the case for Malek, Johann, and Joseph (in his past) (spoiler end)<br />
Enjoyment 8/10: While the series is going through the plot at a moderate pace the placement of Story-focused and Action-focused keeps it from getting too repetitive. I recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys action, demon, and story-driven shows<br />
Overall 9/10: While most people think the pilot episode wasnt the best way to kick off (overuse of CGI) you should watch about up to episode 7 before you make decision. While it does have its flaws, Blassreiter is trying new things such as: being a demonic force spreaded by (SPOILER          ) nanomachines,mixing action,demons,some religious references (nothing too offensive), and mecha into one they are also releasing it on streaming websites (such as Youtube, Crunchyroll, and BostTV) at the same time as the Japanese release. So thats my review, once the series is finished i will be able to make a better review. I have a feeling there is much more in store for us. <br />

    While the story is lacking, as you progress through the series, it becomes more clear. Blassreiter is a severely underrated anime,my recommendation is to give this anime a chance.Personally, i enjoyed this a lot. If you want an anime that&#039;s different this is the one for you.<br />
<br />
Story (9/10):<br />
The story extremely interesting in the sense that it evolves from small incidents to macrosmic effects. In the first few episodes, one couldn&#039;t really tell where the story was going, who the main characters were and just what was going to happen next. However, slowly, but surely the dam broke and plot flowed to swamp us. We are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263852">
        placed in an out of Japan setting with the familiar plot of demons rising to attack humanity, but suddenly we can&#039;t be sure whether that&#039;s all there is to it. I look forward to seeing it grow as the recent episodes seem to hold an extremely promising future for this series.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
I really like Gonzo&#039;s animation. The artwork of Blassreiter is clear. The settings are quite well done, living up to standards of being set in a small German town. The action scenes are generally well done, if a bit confused. Most of you&#039;ll enjoy it, but don&#039;t expect Last Exile or Gankutsuou level animation or artwork.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10):<br />
Perhaps the weakest point in the series. Both OP and ED are really good, particularly the ED (first time, I ever downloaded an anime ending of Gendou).<br />
<br />
Character (10/10):<br />
This series&#039;s characters are hands down one of the most realistic and powerfully depicted personalities this season. You may think I&#039;m lying, but I&#039;m not. You will learn to HATE Jill Hoffman. You will feel Malek&#039;s pain even though you may not have lost someone close to you. You may find yourself questioning Gerd&#039;s intentions and wondering just who the hell Beatrice is. Development of characters is rapid, but also realistic. There personalities may not be thoroughly distinct, but you will find that they may be like one of you: A sister in confusion about her brother&#039;s actions or a disillusioned man trying revive his hero&#039;s faith or a lone wolf watching from afar, living day by day for revenge. Sounds far fetched, but see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10):<br />
Blassreiter managed to keep me awake until 3 am (where I&#039;m living anyway) every Saturday or Sunday, just to get a chance to see a new episode. I am enjoying the series quite a bit. It beats your general run-of-the-mill shonen that gets over 200 episodes, but barely achieves anything in that time a million times over. It&#039;s sad that this must end at 24 episodes, but then again, maybe its one of those animes that have to end there. Those are generally the good ones.<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10):<br />
Whew, I thought this was going to short. I&#039;m glad if you&#039;ve read this far. My advice to you is, don&#039;t look at the top anime score. That&#039;s what people thought when they watched the first couple episodes. This is a heavily underrated series and I hope that this review convinces you to watch it too. Thank you for reading.

    Alright, I don&#039;t normally write reviews, but I&#039;ve got a lot to say about Blassreiter.<br />
<br />
Blassreiter was one of the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my lifetime. But let me give it the benefit of the doubt and start off with what&#039;s good about it. (TL;DR below)<br />
<br />
Pros: The story pacing overall is fairly decent. Not too slow, not too fast. The story itself has nothing wrong with it, in fact it&#039;s not half bad. They don&#039;t try to pump it full of different genre&#039;s that don&#039;t mix.<br />
<br />
Now onto the cons!<br />
<br />
Cons: This is the type of anime that tries waaaay too hard to make you feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203659">
        sad about a character&#039;s death despite the fact the character is so underdeveloped they only count as a supporting character because of the extra screen time. <br />
<br />
The character development overall is some of the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. Bringing up plot devices and killing them off in the same episode in order to force development on the main characters.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the main characters. Think you know who they are? Well you don&#039;t. Because for half the anime the main character acts more like a side character. The biggest plot twist of the entire anime is finding out who the actual main character is.<br />
<br />
Have you ever watched an anime where they bring up suspense devices that hold no meaning to you? Well I hope you like anime like that because this one has a ton of it. You&#039;ll be hearing lines like &quot;Oh no it&#039;s the X377. How dare they use that? if we don&#039;t stop it we&#039;re all doomed!&quot;. And the name X377 holds more meaning that some of the suspense devices they use in this anime.<br />
<br />
Do you like cliche character architypes? Well I sure hope so because every single one of these characters could be the face of the word &quot;cliche&quot;. Want more proof? How about Villains who yell &quot;How dare you!&quot; or &quot;This is impossible!&quot; when they&#039;re losing? <br />
<br />
Have you ever watched an anime where the flashbacks/backstories are more interesting than the main story? You haven&#039;t? Well you will when you watch Blassreiter.<br />
<br />
How about Bullsh*t endings that try to force closure in without you noticing how dumb it is? Hope you like that, because that&#039;s what you&#039;re gonna get at the end.<br />
<br />
Do you like watching anime where halfway through about 5 characters you don&#039;t know show up and the badguy is suddenly an ally and with NO explanation at all? Well if you do, then you should watch Blassreiter, you&#039;ll love it.<br />
<br />
Despite the endless amounts of skin tight mecha suits, big boobs, that one nude scene, and tons of blood gore and action... It was extremely boring and hard to watch. I mean some of the action was good, but after it was over you were still bored.<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
So to summarize and for those TL;DR readers out there... This anime is so bad that not only is it the first anime I considered below 5/10 in rating, but it&#039;s also so bad that it convinced me to write and entire review about it. Do not watch.

    Blassreiter is a seinen sci-fi anime that deals with the concept of hatred &amp; justice but viewers should be warned of the heavy usage of cgi. If that doesn&#039;t bother you then the series itself is a good story but has some minor problems.<br />
<br />
The story of Blassreiter takes place in Germany where these creatures known as Amalgams aka Demoniacs other better understood as &quot;robot zombies&quot; due to them being formed out of corpses &amp; can merge with technology. To stop this threat the XAT are formed to combat these Amalgams, eventually the story moves towards this battle of good evil with the XAT members being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144919">
        the main characters however, that&#039;s when this story comes across some pacing issues.<br />
<br />
For starters, the anime rotates its lead every 4-5 episodes as characters tend to die then we follow our next lead etc. This is good as no character is safe from plot armor, however it doesn&#039;t flow neatly at times. One reason is the character Joseph who by ep 13&amp; 14 we learn of his backstory whose heavily involved with the series villain, Xargin. Because of this odd choice, Joseph who should be the center lead makes random appearances in the beginning of the series &amp; even after his story is revealed he doesn&#039;t become the main focus. While the other XAT members are alright characters to follow, it does feel strange that the villain&#039;s main nemesis is hardly given the spotlight.<br />
<br />
Another problem with the show is its symbolism to religion can feel forced at times. Much of the shows deals with revenge &amp; various depressing topics such as suicides &amp; abuse which often creates these revenge situations. It makes sense to speak of religious topics in this situation but some scenes feel forced &amp; preachy.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime itself is interesting as it does take advantage of its sci-fi mythology of Amalgams &amp; certain characters do feel believable. This is one of those rare series that takes itself very seriously to the point where it can feel depressing at times. Other highlights of this series is its OST being performed by Norihiko Hibino (Metal Gear Solid series) &amp; some of the writing is done by Gen Urobuchi (Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, Phantom Requiem for the Phantom). Blassreiter is unique sci-fi diving into humanity&#039;s scorn for destruction, however it would have been better if certain characters got more appearances in the series or a more steady pace in story telling.

    Outwardly, this show sounds amazing. A Japanese anime NOT set in Japan,  that kills off its first protagonist in the first few episodes and nukes all the second protag&#039;s shit, with zombie-like creatures that merge with vehicles, nano-machines and mechs galore, Sounds like a action junkies&#039; dream come true right? Well if you agreed you&#039;d be all wrong and a bag of chips when it comes to Blassreiter, but more on that later. For now lets start with the positive.<br />
<br />
The animation is great, the 3D sections are done with a similar rendering method to MMD but its been so finely tuned, that shifting from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204075">
        the hand/digitally drawn artwork to 3D isn&#039;t jarring, and keeping 3D things 3D without looking out of place even when the scene is mostly 2D must have been rather difficult to pull off. S-Rank Animation!<br />
<br />
The world is fairly well fleshed out, with the tech making sense in its own mythos, a subtle Angels vs Daemons aesthetic contrasted well by a morally grey world where Angels will make Monsters from Humans because it suits them. A-Rank World Building.<br />
<br />
The sound is good, with only some minor clipping when things explode that isn&#039;t severely noticeable unless you&#039;re using a theater sound system with the sound jacked up, otherwise the sound isn&#039;t particularly special, a lot of the effects get recycled with only just enough variance in tune to avoid getting stale. all the voices sound like they&#039;ve been recorded with bog standard condenser microphones, which sometimes produce contrasting audio to the sound effects, which sound like they where recorded in differently sized rooms to the voices, but all these things are minor problems only audiophiles will be bugged by in any major capacity. B-Rank Sound<br />
<br />
At the 13th episode or so I gave up. Reviewer Integrity be damned. I was SO BORED of the constant whinging these people do when they aren&#039;t busy having the shit kicked out of them or yelling for various uninteresting reasons, and the Story does NOTHING of interest with the great world its built, leaving it all bland enough that mid-episode I started playing Monster Strike out of boredom. Yes, I was so bored I started playing over-complicated digital marbles. FFF-Rank Enjoyment and Characters! Worst Possible!<br />
<br />
Overall, It COULD have been been a great show with a well-built world, excelent premis, and well done 3D that meshes well with its drawing style if its boring characters and poorly-written story didn&#039;t cock the whole thing up a rusty drain pipe... D-Rank Overall ranking, just barely not bad enough to hate, but so boring and dry like straight uncooked tofu most (American?) people will walk away.

    Are you willing to protect someone you love with your life? Are you able to atone for all the sins you have done?<br />
“No matter how cruel the world is, life has meaning” – Joseph Jobson<br />
<br />
I know it is strange to start a review by giving the significance of this anime and the message it leaves behind, but I believe it is something in life that is kept quiet about.<br />
<br />
Suicide…Self Sacrifice… Submission… Never Lose Hope... Never Give Up<br />
<br />
While watching this anime, which I highly recommend, not for the artwork but for the story think about change. Think about the importance of human life and being alive

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85963">
        each day. Think about why you were born into this world. Do not ever forget that you having a meaning in this world and that you are important.<br />
<br />
The name of the anime “Blassreiter” which is a German word that translates to “Pale Rider” is a very unique name. Many anime’s are either named in a very simple matter… for instance “Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo” which translates to “The Pet Girl of Sakurasou” which literally translates word for word what the anime is about, or you have anime’s like “K” where there is no solid meaning but you can pull hints from like the names of each episodes or maybe translating it as “Kings” by pulling information from the songs used, and what the anime is about. But Blassreiter is different, I am sure many of you don’t know what a “Pale Rider” is as I was unsure, but upon investigation it means “a horseman” and in those terms I understand fully why the anime was named that, but I will not explain why because it does contain a huge spoiler. You will have to watch the show to find out what the true meaning of this show is. <br />
<br />
Within watching the first 2 episodes of this anime, I was already confused. They throw all these terms at you like “Amalgams” and “Demoniacs” and to be honest after those first 2 episodes I just became hooked. The first day I watched 16 episodes, and the next day I watched the remaining 8 episodes. I do sometimes manage to go through other series at this accelerated pace, but most of the time I will end up skimming some of the episodes and skipping over unnecessary parts that are just their as fillers, this show however I managed to practically watch the whole show through. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
At first I thought the story had no clear direction in which it was going, but after a while you figure out generally what is going on. The story takes place in a “fictional Germany” and research is conducted to create almost like “perfect humans” but for war.  There are 2 distinctive sides in this show, a military group called XAT, which is trying to stop the outbreak of Demoniacs, and then the other side which I assumed you have figured out. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There are 4 main characters in this show that I will be talking about.<br />
<br />
Gerd Frentzen: aka “Champ”. He is the undefeated racing champion and seen as an idol by many. <br />
<br />
Joseph Jobson: He is a unique character whom you probably will not understand his intentions until later on in the story, and you can decide if what he was doing was correct. In my opinion, aside from being one of the most important characters he is also one that teaches you the most important lessons. <br />
<br />
Hermann Saltza: He is an officer of XAT and also Gerds best friend who sticks up for him no matter what.<br />
<br />
Amanda Werner: This is the character that so highly resembles Mayor Lil from “Ergo Proxy”. Almost everything about them is identical and being able to see a character like this just put such a big smile to my face. Aside from that, Amanda is an officer of XAT and is partnered up with Hermann. <br />
<br />
This is one of the shows where character development was huge and all the main characters had such a big impact. Many shows I watch, you see main characters who get tons of screen time but you wonder what their real purpose is, and after finishing the show you realize… nothing they just needed to add someone as a filler almost. Those types of shows tend to sadden me the most because they always had the potential to be able to shine. This show I became absolutely attached to all the main characters but if I had to choose one it would have to be “Amanda Werner”. There is no other obvious choice for “me” because of how similar she is to Mayor Lil. Mayor Lil is by far one of my favorite characters, from her personality, all the way to her looks and design. So me becoming attached to Amanda Werner was no big surprise after all.<br />
<br />
Artwork:<br />
I have to be brutally honest I am normally not super critical about artwork, but the artwork in this show was absolutely horrendous. Maybe horrendous is a little bit over kill but I am sure you understand, it just angered me to the bottom of my soul. To have such an amazing story and such amazing characters, for it to just be killed by the artwork is just such a shame.  What I hated the most out of all was just the design for Demoniacs, they just looked horrible and the designs were very repetitive throughout each Demoniac. Aside from that factor, the artwork for the rest was okay. Also going based on the battle scenes everything just happened too fast. I don’t mean “fast” as in they could have added some episodes in here and there for more development I mean it just hurt my eyes to watch the fights. Everything was just all over the place and it was hard to follow what was actually going on, and the next thing you know someone was dead and you missed everything. I cannot stand shows that do this; to me it is just like people who are too lazy to throw their trash away. This show was almost too lazy to go into more detailed battle scenes and just threw it together like a mosh pit.<br />
<br />
Sound: OP/ED<br />
I am just going to go through some of the songs used in this anime, starting from the end. <br />
<br />
The Last ED “Sweet Lies” – by Itou Kanako which is only used in the last episode (24) was by far the best one of this anime. The setting and mood that this anime left you in alongside then hearing this song was just soothing. This song was so perfectly chosen. Honestly when I was finished watching the show and then this song came on at the end it literally brought me on the verge of tears (I don’t tend to cry during animes but I get that watery feeling like when you are about to cry). This song just made me unbelievable happy and left such an amazing feeling that I was speechless at the end. Not many anime’s are able to evoke such an emotion. Even as I am listening to the full song while writing this (and I just finished the anime about 20-30 minutes ago) I feel as though I just finished watching it seconds ago and I am back in that moment. <br />
<br />
The second OP “Unripe Hero” – by Minami Kuribayashi was just absolutely stunning. The lyrics of the song are soo fitting towards this anime. In General, OP/ED tend to be chosen very well, but in this particular case the Last ED was by far the best.<br />
<br />
I can probably spend quite a bit of time on the songs used in this anime but the last one I want to talk about is the 3rd ED “A Wish for the Stars” – by Itou Kanako. Using the same artist again is something animes tend to do a lot of, and honestly it is something that leaves a really good impression. Now this song was honestly just as good as the Last ED but I cannot say it was because even though it had the same tone, the mellowness and serenity left inside the melody… I am going to try my best to put what is inside my head into words but I doubt it is going to sound 100% accurate. By using this song for about half the anime, I loved it but it just cannot beat using a song once for an ending that practically fits perfectly together like a puzzle. By all means thought this song was amazing. This show really kicked off using such amazing songs for the OP and especially for the ED!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
There is really no place to start other than saying “if I managed to watch this in 2 days, it must mean something”.  Like I wish I was able to take what is inside my brain right now and write it in words, but we all know that is nearly impossible so we have to compensate. On an enjoyment rate of 1-10, this scale cannot be used for how good it was, it is just over and beyond amazing. At first I was not expecting much because this show just threw soo much at you as I stated above but in the end I feel as if it managed to really kick through and leave such a big impact. Like honestly I have watched over 150 animes and I am going to say this is going be one of the few that I re-watch, I am not going to say like re-watch from episode 1 to episode 24 every minute, but I will probably re-watch at least 12 of the episodes fully, that is just how amazing of a show this was. The thing is like the suspense that this show left from watching the first time is something that I almost see as nearly impossible, to be able to evoke the exact same feelings at the same level as watching it the first time. Now I could be wrong but when I do re-watch this show I am going to probably skim through many of the episodes but will watch some of them thoroughly again.<br />
<br />
Just as a little added special, I noticed that the top 2 recommended animes were Blood+ and Darker than Black. I am not going to say those are bad choices but in my opinion they are not correct. By far the most relevant anime relating to Blassreiter is Ergo Proxy. Once I was around episode 5 of Blassreiter that show just kept on popping up into my head and of how similar it was. I would highly highly HIGHLY recommend watching Ergo Proxy. The second show which I would recommend is Ga-Rei: Zero. I am not sure how to explain it but the stories are very similar, about self sacrifice and being able to protect what you love. Also Ga-Rei had one of the most amazing scenes on the final episode. What made me think of this show, was not only the story but the final episode. Like I can just remember vividly the music in the background which was soo similar to this its unbelievable. When I watched Ga-Rei I didn’t think I would be able to find an ending scene like that, but Blassreiter has managed to do it.<br />

    Honestly, when I started watching this I didn&#039;t really like it much, but for some reason I couldn&#039;t stop watching it, and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. <br />
It honestly starts off pretty slow, kinda just giving you an idea of what these amalgam creatures are and setting up the idea that there&#039;s a greater scheme to things, that there&#039;s something more to this amalgam outbreak. Then the story develops into a full on apocalypse type scenario; while our main amalgam/human characters are fighting against the demoniacs for the safety of the townspeople, society still fears and detests them, and the issue of the demoniacs/amalgams even shows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287605">
        to become a global worry. I absolutely love the incorporation of the media aspect in this show, it adds to the mass hysteria/impending apocalypse vibe and makes the story seem all the more real. <br />
I think one of the best things this show has going for it is it&#039;s originality, now I&#039;m not saying the plot is extremely original for an anime, but it has so many different aspects to play to so many different people&#039;s interests. It&#039;s got military, mecha, racing, apocalypse, inhuman creatures/ superhumans. I think the most original thing about this show though, is the design for the amalgams, being they&#039;re &#039;cybernetic&#039; creatures, humans that can transform into these agile, armored, superhuman creatures; that the armor of the amalgams isn&#039;t separate super armor, it&#039;s part of that person, and everyone&#039;s (Joseph, Gerd, Malik, and Hermann) amalgam forms are different and unique to that character&#039;s personality.<br />
Honestly, I really enjoyed this show, and I feel like I liked it more after I had been finished with it and continued to think about it&#039;s story and characters. I&#039;m usually not interested in these genres of anime, but after watching this I&#039;ve been trying so hard to find other&#039;s like it, but have failed in my search... Which I guess is a good thing? It just proves the shows originality.

    Blassreiter is a dark action-drama focused around the exploits of a German military organization known as XAT being tasked with fending off the threat arisen from biomechanical creatures called Demoniacs spawned from corpses and infecting the populace. Also battling the threat is a mysterious young man named Joseph who also wields the power to turn into a Demoniac, though he is able to maintain his normal mental state unlike those who become infected by the strain. The series is divided up into several arcs exploring how several characters in the series become affected by the Demoniac strain and what they seek to gain through utilizing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178671">
        its power. Behind the scenes, a couple mysterious individuals are exploiting the strain and personal traumas of those milking the power of a Demoniac for their personal gain.<br />
<br />
For the most part, Blassreiter is solid with developing its plot and characters in terms of exploring how certain characters become affected by the Demoniac strain, the causes of it and why said characters desire to utilize its power. A number of the characters in the series have some rather tragic back stories that serve to drive their decisions with utilizing their newly found power as a Demoniac. The negatives of having such power are explored as some abuse it for their personal gain without realizing the moral ramifications of their actions while others are driven to madness by it as such where they struggle to maintain their humanity or lose it all together. The series slowly reveals the origins of the Demoniac threat and what connection Joseph has to them as he is seemingly acquainted with the main enemy threat responsible for spreading its plague among the German populace.<br />
<br />
Still, the series isn&#039;t without its faults. The series can at points get a bit heavy handed with how it portrays its drama and religious themes. In terms of drama, Blassreiter can be quite melodramatic with depicting the developments of its cast and said drama can get overbearing as such where one may have trouble caring seriously for it at points, most notably with aspects of Joseph and Malek&#039;s backgrounds. Also, the show&#039;s attempts at religious symbolism feel really forced as attempts to milk Christian iconography and Bible verses to try expressing something meaningful come across more awkward than natural. Beyond this, the show isn&#039;t really offering much new with its premise as aspects to its storytelling have been milked in one form or another in sci-fi, action and drama titles. Also, do be warned this baby can get rather graphic with its content as there is a high death count in Blassreiter and characters tend to die in some rather bloody and messy ways at points.<br />
<br />
Visually, the show is rather pleasing on the eyes for the most part. Character and scenery designs sport subdued color tones and a good amount of visual detail that do well at complimenting the dark and gritty mood that Blassreiter wishes to show off. The visual highlight to the series comes in the form of the Demoniacs and any mecha from human forces being utilized for battle scenes. While the 3D CG animation used in their rendering sticks out like a sore thumb with the regular animation, it is still nicely rendered and onscreen action with mecha and Demoniacs is fluid and intense, making this a nice feast for the eyes with action anime fans.<br />
<br />
While having its issues and not really breaking new ground, Blassreiter is still a decent time-killer with what it has to offer up for a dark action-drama. While not up to par with Bokurano and Gankutsuou, Blassreiter is still one of the more decent offerings made by Gonzo.<br />

    I&#039;m going to start off by saying, disregard any and all reviews prior to your reading of this review. You can&#039;t &quot;rate&quot; something like this by any normal means. You can&#039;t &quot;rate&quot; ANYTHING by any normal means or scale. Numbers don&#039;t equate to the resulting emotions and internal questions created by art. As men create art, the only way to fully and truly comprehend it and &quot;rate&quot; it is to watch it for yourself. This anime especially fits that. The best works of art are the ones that half of people say they hate, and half say they undyingly worship. This is one of those

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220067">
        works. Now I&#039;ll begin reviewing it in the best way possible, without slipping ANY details, as you should know if you&#039;ve already learned ANYTHING, you&#039;ve pretty much ruined it- the point of art like this is to watch it yourself, don&#039;t ever look up another review in your life again and never look at age ratings, you should always go in blind and prepared for simply whatever the creator of the work throws at you. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m REQUIRED to use a damned number scale, but ignore it entirely. Although I did give it straight tens across the board for fulfilling what the average viewer would desire of an emotional piece such as this.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s safe to say that the significance of this anime will catch you off guard, and if you can&#039;t find relation to animes or shows and are merely looking for &quot;a good time&quot; and not a lasting work that should forever be revered in history, turn the hell back now and go watch Space Patrol Lululoco because that&#039;d be more up your alley of &quot;I actually have a life and just wanna anime and chill&quot;. This anime is a roller coaster that will bring you on a remarkable and inspiring journey through hate, despair, love, and fear. From the triumphs of man will come his own demise, just as the triumph that is this piece of art will bring the demise to any momentary happiness you have. Instead, you&#039;ll be left with a void, which will then be consumed by a yearning for answers to philosophical questions and scenarios posed in this anime. The only words that come to mind to describe the emotions left by this anime are; &quot;intelligent&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;depression&quot;, and &quot;compassion&quot;. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s all any true review can say without spoiling the art, so I&#039;ll end it with a final statement of legitimate facts. I cried almost every episode, literally. I also took a month or so long break because it was just too emotional to watch in one go. I just looked over and realized I&#039;m supposed to say why I liked it, you don&#039;t like art. You experience. I experienced it. Your take is your take. I HATE the emotions it made me feel, but that doesn&#039;t mean I hate the art work. That would be a blatant example of shooting the messenger. The piece itself is the sum of all the parts, not their breakdown.

    Let&#039;s start off with something about how the story is shown. This is portrayed like something you&#039;d read in a history book. All sides are shown, but some characters (the main characters, obviously) are more important/favored and thus have more screen time. Most of the story involves Joseph somehow, he&#039;s been a part of nearly everything, but he probably has the least amount of screen time/action of the main characters even though he&#039;s the protagonist.<br />
<br />
The story eventually connects all together and I personally got into around episode 13. After that, I couldn&#039;t wait for what would happen next.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters all have some sort

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52467">
        of expansion and background, so that&#039;s nice; it really gives them some life. You can even sympathize with the enemies, just because of how they were made and what happened to them.<br />
<br />
The art wasn&#039;t the best because the CG is awful, at least in the start. You either get used to it or the quality just improves.. I&#039;m not really sure which.<br />
<br />
This series has a valuable undertone; and there&#039;s really no getting away with anything. The key point expressed is probably atonement.<br />
<br />
I can understand why people dislike this. I was expecting something entirely different when I started watching, so that may be why it seems to undervalued, but it really is a worthwhile watch. The genre being listed just as action and sci-fi really doesn&#039;t do the story justice.. <br />
<br />
Get watching. It&#039;s worth it in the end.<br />

    If you&#039;re like me and you&#039;re here reading reviews for the show to determine whether or not it&#039;s worth watching I&#039;ll ask you a couple of questions. Do you like/know what Kamen Rider is? Can you stand heavy use of dated CG? Do you take issue with characters being introduced just so they can be killed off? If any of these are deal breakers for you Blassreiter is probably not for you. It might sound like I don&#039;t like this show, but that&#039;s not the case; it was just a unusual show. It didn&#039;t age terribly well, and it had some odd writing quirks. If

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336687">
        you&#039;ve ever seen Kamen Rider you probably get why I made the comparison.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10: Blassreiter had the potential to be a really good show IMO, but it&#039;s biggest fault was that the sow didn&#039;t know what it wanted to do with itself. All together too often we get episodes that basically feature a freak of the week or otherwise don&#039;t contribute in any meaningful way to the plot. Which is even worse since this show could have easily stripped away these episodes and been a 12 episode show.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 The actual 2D visuals are pretty good IMO, I never saw anything that made me want to gouge out my eyes, and there weren&#039;t any jarring moments of &quot;Holy crap that had to be intentionally bad&quot; (All eyes on YOU Gundam AGE) The 3D CG was pretty terrible at first, but I got used to it fairly quick. The fight scenes can be a bit of a clusterf*k at times, but you can still generally tell whats going on.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10 Both OP&#039;s were pretty good and I liked the ED&#039;s well enough, though they were pretty unmemorable. As far as the proper OST goes there only 1 track I ever really noticed playing, and it&#039;s not even that good. The only reason sound gets as good of a score as it does is because I rather liked the Dub.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10 I really wanted the characters to shine, but they mostly fell flat. Gerd was really interesting, it&#039;s mostly downhill from there. Amanda was hardly an actual character, she was mostly a set piece to other peoples character arcs. I hated Malek for like 90% of the show&#039;s run. He could&#039;ve been semi-interesting, but they end up re-using a lot of his backstory for Joseph, which was intentional, but I still feel like it hurt Malek. I did rather like Hermann until the last few episodes. He was supposed to be hard headed but there limits to how far you can take that. Let&#039;s not even get STARTED on Zwölf they were just there to pad out the show, and it would honestly been better without them. The most interesting (I.E. The ONLY really interesting Characters IMO) were Joseph and Xargin. I can&#039;t really go into what makes them so interesting without spoiling the show, but it had an interesting take on handling the main characters being religious.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 I WANT to score it an eight, but honestly the ending was bad enough to dial back my enjoyment. Blassreiter is by no means a perfect show, hell a lot of the time it has more going against it then it does with it, but overall I still think it was pretty fun, and even had some good ideas; even if they didn&#039;t really execute them very well.

    Many people who follow and know anime has begun to recognize the name that is Gen Urobuchi. He is a writer for many Japanese visual novels, light novels, and of course anime and his signature style of writing has a dark style, nihilistic themes, and tragic plot twists, earning him the fan nickname &quot;Urobutcher.&quot; He did work for the visual novel software company NitroPlus, which most of the shows he worked on were involved also, but for this title we’re reviewing today, this is an original work and collaboration of NitroPlus and Studio Gonzo. <br />
<br />
The story is set in a fictional Germany and centers on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118789">
        the outbreak of biomechanical creatures called &quot;Demoniacs&quot;, who rise from corpses and attack people savagely.[4] The Demoniacs have the ability to merge with most technology including cars and motorcycles, not only gaining control of them but also enhancing their performance greatly. Against them is a group of people known as XAT (Xenogenesis Assault Team) who police these Demoniacs in an attempt to keep the peace and discover the reasons for the &quot;Demoniac&quot; change. All the while, a number of human-turned-Demoniacs appear. Some use their powers for good, others for evil. One will rise above all other Demoniacs to become known as the &quot;Blassreiter”<br />
<br />
Once going into the show, I was a bit confused going into the plot as it first felt like a motorcycle sports show, although most viewers got confused from that first episode (and by now, people will notice Urobuchi’s way of tricking the audience within the first few episodes of an anime and then it’ll show its true self) and the first opening thinking it was like that but after that gimmick was done, it did play out like a sci-fi action show, set in a foreign land (well, Germany) with some really depressing dark tones (such as dealing with bullying because of one character origins’ and nationality, i.e. being an outsider and questioning why no one will stand for justice and possibly their god as well – yeah, the show does slap around religion to an extent), especially going through most of the main characters’ flashback stories and what’s going on with them now. The story goes through character arcs with the main ones, in order being Gerd Frentzen, Malek Werner, Joesph Jobson, Hermann Saltza, and Amanda Werner.<br />
<br />
Some of the characters written does provide some mystery and interesting character development but the thing is it is only the ones with the character arcs….well, all except Gerd as he doesn’t really stick in the show for that long, at least as an important part. Other minor characters doesn’t really stick out much as some of them are mostly red shirts that are obviously going to die. Joesph did provide mystery in his character, Malek did made me feel sympathetic to what’s he going through, Amanda is that character that tries to keep it all together, Hermann is the hot-headed character who will do anything to save the people he know and Gerd…..is that unlucky guy who got it troubling when the show started.<br />
<br />
As for the animation, Gonzo learned some things about the CGI usage in their show and how it can sometimes stands out as blocky and weird and not in the best of shape. However, in comparison to Gonzo’s other anime works, this one is slightly above average. The artwork is also fine with its setting being in Germany and when going into a flashback, it really compliments the setting very nicely.<br />
<br />
For the music, I really didn’t felt anything from the score or any of the opening and ending songs were standing out. They were some standard j-rock openings and calm, serene and relaxing j-pop songs and the score were just standard action anime music.<br />
<br />
For the FUNimation dub, someone’s vocal range showed in this anime and I’m proud to say that Todd Haberkorn was the most improved in this show, mainly because if you watched the shows he’s in (Hetalia, Sgt. Frog, even Shiki), the nasally whiny voice of his always appeared and it’s not like I don’t like it. It’s good, particularly in Sgt. Frog but in here and more recently as he does English dubs in L.A., he shows more of a deep yet smooth voice, which he does very well. Hell, you’ll forget that this is a guy who voiced a green space alien frog. (Yes, I like Sgt. Frog. So what?) As for the other cast members, Travis Willingham was alright, Jamie Marchi was good and Micah Soulsod (or the VA people mistaken for Johnny Yong Bosch a few times) was decent as well.<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT: This show is hard to understand at first but if you’re not that confused, you might get into it although I know some of you won’t. I would recommend this show to you, but I would say that this really acquires your attention or read ahead before going into the show (just don’t go for spoilers if you want to experience it as a surprise).

               Blassreiter (sigh), I almost gave up on this one. I was actually looking forward to it when I saw the trailer because the effect was good like an online game, but haven’t had the chance to watch it. Then when I had the time I was disappointed. I really expect something from this, but when I watch it I have this heavy feeling that I can’t explain like a burden so I dropped it. Well the story was good and kinda like a resident evil with all those virus thingy that will make you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32419">
        a demon and make you lose your sense but the twists in the story doesn’t seem to have that twisty effect on me. <br />
          The fight scenes are good though the blood and gore of killing just doesn’t go well with their appearance when they transform into their demon selves; they look more of those sentai masked riders which I found very humorous. Even if I wish to laugh about their appearance the scenes have this always heavy atmosphere so I can’t. The characters are good and all for me are likable even the bad guys. The female characters are pretty and the males’ ranges from ugly to hot. The female lead, Amanda is great and isn’t like the stereotype characters with a sexy body and mash for brains. The one I really like is the male lead Joseph because he’s HOT, though he’s unsociable, stoic and nonchalant type of coolness is very common. I really want them to end up together as a compensation for the pain they gave me, though I know this isn’t a shoujo animé and there isn’t that much to hope for about that, still I wish with all my heart to have that romance feel at least. I’m not actually expecting a romance in this animé at first but after a while I just begin to wish for it as a form of salvation for this animé.  Plus the ending is I don’t know a very big &quot; JUST WHAT THE HELL  DID THAT MEAN?!&quot; They’re there but they’re not, are they a program or are there really a fantasy in there? Like another world or a magical thing that binds them. I began to rethink what genre this should be because it’s a sci-fi but the ending is not sci-fi-ish at all it’s more of like a fantasy  power fiction. Oh well good thing I finished it already if you wanna watch it be prepared for an alternative animé so that when you feel you can’t take it just switch to another.

    Summary: Let me start this off by saying I don&#039;t like the mech genre. In fact, the components of this that are mech related embody everything that I don&#039;t like about that genre. This isn&#039;t really a mech anime though, it is actually more of a blend of a tragic/philosophical/character driven narrative that shines most when mechs are no where to be found.<br />
<br />
The story starts fairly cliche... a group fighting evil robots to save the world. Over time, the plot expands and grows into a cluster of different organizations and groups, many different characters and story arcs and a huge philosophical battle over the &quot;correct&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210660">
        fate of the world. This is one of those neat anime where the good and bad guys both make sense and all of the characters are relatable and their character development is rational based on their experiences. I understood all of the characters and why they did what they did,.<br />
<br />
That being said, there are definitely issues with this anime. At around 20 episodes in I seriously considered dropping it. I didn&#039;t know why because I enjoyed the story and thought it was interesting and different but something was off. Then it hit me... this anime is just too damn long and there are too many characters. It feels like this was a 2 season anime with roughly 2/3 of a season worth of filler. What&#039;s weird is it isn&#039;t like a normal filler where the main characters just sit around doing not a whole lot but instead there are whole arcs and character sets that could have been entirely eliminated and the main story would have been stronger.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a mech anime, you will not like this (generally sloppy fights and terribly CG). If you&#039;re looking for something with a lot of characters and a tragic story with philosophical and religious undertones you may enjoy this. Keep in mind that the story goes all over the place and there are a ton of characters but if you&#039;re OK with that you&#039;re in for an interesting ride.

    Blassreiter, was interesting and better than some people might think.  It had an interesting premise of man merging with machines, known as demoniacs.  Joseph Jobson is a demoniac, but he hasn&#039;t been totally corrupted by the process as he holds on to his humanity.  He tries to help other people not to become demoniacs.  It interesting as you watch the show and some become demoniacs right away, but others fight against and are not completely corrupted, or in other words don&#039;t completely fuse with the machine.<br />

What made this story enjoyable was how the story progressed and the final outcome.  It

        was kind of weird seeing people merging with machines and freaky.  I did like all of the action though and there was some resolution.  It&#039;s a cyberpunk action fest.  I enjoyed it more than Texhnolyze mainly because of all the cool action.<br />

    OMG! wtf did I lay eyes upon!. There are no words i can use to describe the contempt i have for this dumpster fire. <br />
<br />
It sounded interesting and the synopsis drew me in but the first 10 mins of watching this i felt disturbed by the wacky 3d, very low budget<br />
<br />
I stopped watching after the first episode based on the other reviews I&#039;d be willing to bet that the story becomes better after some episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
 But i&#039;m not gonna risk it after watching the first episode the cgi is just so bad i can&#039;t take it......&gt;.&lt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only that but the story feels all over itself
