[story]<br />
Classic shonen. Slow paced, generic plot points, overall over half of the series is slice of life. Its strong sides lie within the light comedy and world building. Those who are looking for a meaningful story or epic writing stuff won&#039;t find any from here. However, those who have wished for a series that is somewhat like &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; from its style/approach but wanted to see this being implemented inside fighting tournament shonen story line, will see how their prayers are answered here and now, and without a doubt there will never be a series quite like this one as an alternative.<br />
<br />
[characters]<br />
I can&#039;t help but to be reminded of Sketch Dance when seeing this cast. Melie is so quality she end up being my main reason for enjoying this series so much. Split personality girl with ridiculously well-planned character design, and characteristics and behavior that serves her cuteness. Seth is more generic shonen lead except he doesn&#039;t yell all that much and his morals aren&#039;t there to ruin the fun. The side casting contains no annoying archetypes or contrarian buttholes which is all for the better. The light comedic approach also can be seen to effect the cast which ultimately serves the idea of the show. The good part being that the characters still feel genuine and are practically never used as comedic devices or fanservice figures in the series, excluding some animation scenes that use some commonly seen goofs, but these are not really executed with character behavior, just movement. Most of the cast members are super happy and positive which again, further adds to the CGDCT-like style. Smart decisions.<br />
<br />
[sounds]<br />
Utopia is a 9/10 opening song. BGM is chill and well-though. They play goddamn jazz during coffee drinking scenes. //argument. Melie&#039;s seiyuu work is amazing be she making a weird, untranslatable anime sound or going nuts with her other personality, it all delivers. Some bigger names are here along less-known seiyuus, but they all do good job, meaning if they stand out they only do so because their work is so pleasant to listen.<br />
<br />
[art, animation]<br />
Bright color pallet. Soft, fluffy and cute are things that were prioritized in design. The simplicity of the animation is a pleasure to watch. Not too much and not too little. Balance exist among this work. Naturally, Melie&#039;s hair takes 90% of the screen whenever she is there, but it can be forgiven for it is the fluffiest piece of hair seen in anime. <br />
<br />
[enjoyment]<br />
Never expected to like this series so much. I am not familiar with the source material so I can&#039;t speak on the behalf of those who wanted a loyal adaptation, but as an anime only watcher, this type of light series with its fresh approach was exactly what I needed. Those who thought &quot;I could enjoy a show like this&quot; when reading this review most likely will.

    Oh no, Radiant isn’t a perfect adaptation! What has the world come to?!<br />
<br />
We get it. This isn’t one of those anime that will meet our expectations by adaptation standards. From the beginning, I’ve heard of comments about how the anime changed the tone of the story and even the way the main protagonist has been adapted into it. For the sake of this review, it will be based from an anime viewer’s perspective. I’m not going to go into the French series to look and compare every episode to see what was wrong with it.<br />
<br />
Now with that mushy stuff out of the way, you may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302248">
        be wondering what exactly is Radiant. As a French comic, there’s actually not much difference to tell between this and Japanese manga. Artwork resembles shounen style characters with a fantasy world setting and even the speech patterns. Not to be judgmental but I think it’s pretty clear that Radiant is aimed for a wider audience. The story takes place in a fictional world where monsters exists. Known as “Nemesis”, they are creatures with catastrophic powers that fell into the world of humanity and causing devastating damage. A young man named Seth survived the catastrophe and vows to hunt down the Nemesis as a Sorcerer and one day hope to bring peace in their world. So begins his quest to find the legendary Radiant, the origins of the Nemesis.<br />
<br />
I’m not going to lie, the first few episodes had me bite my lips a few times. Essentially, I see Seth as a brat who may be easily be the type to die young. His recklessness and daredevil personality from the start makes him hard to follow. Not to mention, he isn’t very talented in the art of magic as demonstrated by his flying skills. The only move in the boy’s arsenal that makes a difference is his signature “Titan Punch”. But if you look just a bit carefully, it’s pretty much a shounen-style punch powered up with a signature pose and name shout. That’s damn disappointing. To make matters worse, Seth isn’t exactly a Brainiac either. The boy is so eager to prove himself that he puts an entire town in danger just so he can show the world what he can do. Looking back now, I can easily say that Seth is nothing short of a dumbass.<br />
<br />
Now, don’t worry. This show isn’t just about Seth as the adventure begins to take off after around 5 episodes. After all, it’s his quest and we follow him on his journey find this “Radiant”. On his quest, Seth encounters new allies named Melie and Doc. Now, both of these characters made a different impression to me. For instance, Melie is a bit naïve and too friendly as a girl. Sometimes, I could easily say she’s inattentive. A plot device also reveals that her personality can change into a much fierier badass when under distress. With this type of character, it’s not hard to make us wonder about the importance of her split personality. However, the anime plays it out more of a comic relief and after you’ve seen it a dozen times, it quickly becomes stale. On the other hand, Melie does make a valuable asset for the team as she seems to be a skilled Sorcerer with defensive abilities. This is a contrast to Doc, the researcher who comes off as absolutely useless in their adventure. Driven as an anti-fighter, Doc tries to avoid danger whenever possible while trying to woo Miss Melba, a café waitress that he seems to be in love with. With this oddball group of adventurers together, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
Actually, there’s a lot of wrong things about Radiant that could have been executed much better as a story. At its very baseline, I feel like the story took way too long to get us to care about it. Most of the first few episodes made me dislike the main protagonist for his childish personality. It’s very easy to find Seth irritating along with his questionable logic. Think about some of his actions and it’s not far from those of an underage teenager. Additionally, the story itself seems to be running around in circles without getting the viewers emotionally attached to it. I’m not going to lie, before I even began watching this show, I thought there would be at least some emotional value. The premise almost made the show sounded like a tragic story but instead, we get a cartoony version of a fantasy quest. It took far too long to get the show moving and by the time the gears really started kicking, it’s too late to turn back. Believe me, a story like this really needed a likable protagonist but Seth is about as one dimensional as he can get. He’s far from a larger than life character and an incredibly difficult to tolerate with his personality. The other two on his journey are hardly any better. Melie is too nice as a girl and hard to really talk about besides her split personality. Doc is pretty much the butt monkey in the show where it’s easy to point fingers at how useless he is. However, there are some supporting cast that I want to address as discarding them would be unfair.<br />
<br />
To start with, Alma is a character that I grew interest in after seeing her wisdom. She is not only a Nemesis Hunter but also a skilled Sorcerer while serving as a parental figure for Seth. The show could have taken the opportunity to build more between their relationship but instead, she is pretty much left over after the first episodes. Then, there’s Grim, the mysterious figure that our adventurous trio encounters. I was intrigued by his debut but over time, I didn’t find his character to be appealing at all. The fact is, we don’t know his true agenda in the show besides lending in some occasional help to the protagonists. Now, what about the Inquisition? Every fantasy anime like this needs a military group and government to control their world, right? To be honest, I feel like there’s little creativity put in for such an organization. They seem to have a prejudice against infected people and made up of ranks among its staff to carry out their goals. If you’re familiar with military organizations, then it’s easy to recognize some of their ranks such as general, colonel, commander, cadet, etc. Unfortunately, the show falls short on investing into the higher ranked characters. Guys like Dart Dragunov and Konrad are easily forgettable. The latter even seems to play the role of a stereotypical commander who abides with its organization’s goals. At some point in the show, I question if the Inquisition were hiding something beyond what they seem to be. For a 2-cour show, that didn’t really seem possible with such pacing. Now that brings back to my original point. This series suffers not just pacing problems but the way it made its characters. None of them are worth investing into and in the long run, they are too damaged to be repaired.<br />
<br />
Adapted by studio Lerche, their resume is a bit questionable when people talk about their fantasy projects. Anime like Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut and the more recent Shichisei no Subaru were mediocre at best in terms of production quality. Judging on Radiant by itself, there’s hardly anything eye catchy about the visual quality either. The character designs gives off a blend feel between shounen and fantasy. Meanwhile, the Sorcerers themselves are decorated with some degree of distinction. (see Melie) Then, there’s Seth, our reckless protagonist who possesses inhuman characteristics such as his horns. The battle choreography in the show remains fluid on some levels although it’s nothing spectacular. Trust me, once you’ve seen the first fight, it almost feels like you’ve seen them all. On the other hand, I do praise the world fiction of the show. It’s not only crafted with a decent amount of fantasy elements but also reinforces the importance of its setting through storytelling. <br />
<br />
Let me just say that Radiant could have been a big hitter or at least make a strong impression for a foreign project outside of Japan. It should have at least tried to get the audience’s attention. The key word here is “tried”. Because the reality is, Radiant didn’t manage to capitalize on what it advertised. Instead, it’s a show that threw away its chances and made itself look like a fool.<br />

    In this season nothing for the most part happens. We have two real arcs and that&#039;s about it. However it is still something worth watching.<br />
<br />
The whole premise of the show is for Seth to find Radiant to destroy it and save the world. Sounds fun let&#039;s go and save the world, but why. One thing I like about this anime is how they deal with the discrimination against sorcerers.  In the arc were the go to Rumble Town Seth is forced to really understand what he is trying to do and who is he trying to save. I very much like this because even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302260">
        though his answer is something anyone would guess he would say he does struggle trying to understand why he is doing all of this and for who. <br />
<br />
Most of the episodes is just slice of life stuff. A lot of the episodes are just Seth, Melie, and Doc doing shit in the Sorcery city. Even though now much of anything happens they are still fun episodes which fans of the show can enjoy. As well as helps us see more of the city they stay in.<br />
<br />
One of the main strengths is the animation. The animation is very strong from start to finish. The fight scenes are so fucking beautiful which makes the show even more of a blast to watch.<br />
<br />
In conclusion the ending left on a bit of a cliff hanger but seems like shit will go down in the next season which I am excited for. Can&#039;t wait to see what the next season will do.

    Radiant is the spiritual successor to Black Clover. I say this because the same strengths/issues I have with that series are present here.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10): <br />
<br />
The story is about a cursed boy named Seth who becomes a sorcerer and goes out on a quest to find Radiant in order to defeat the Nemesis which inhabit this world. It’s pretty much your typical shounen premise where Seth yells he’s going to find Radiant and become the Wizard King/Hokage!<br />
<br />
You know how important first impressions are? Well the first 10 episodes leave a lot to be desired considering they’re more or less filler content. Radiant only starts to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302609">
        good during its first arc- Rumble Town at ep.11. <br />
<br />
Characters (5/10):<br />
<br />
Seth is like Asta’s twin brother. Seth is dense, dumb as bricks, reckless, childish, loud and annoying. Pretty much your typical shounen protagonist. His constant screaming isn’t as annoying as Asta, but it’s still obnoxious. Admittedly, he does get some character development later on this season e.g. he questions whether nemesis are really bad, which is good. <br />
<br />
Melie is probably my favourite out of the main cast. I like her design and her split personality caused by her curse. If she weren’t so ditzy, going along with Seth’s shenanigans and got more focus on her then i’d say she has potential to be a great character. <br />
<br />
Doc is arguably the worst character in the series. He’s a annoying, one dimensional comedic relief character. Literally the only things to come out of his mouth is about debt or him fantasising about being with Ms Melba. We get it, you like Ms Melba, now change it up!<br />
<br />
When I first saw Grimm I thought he’d be more than a cool, mysterious character. Turns out i was wrong. He doesn’t have much going for him character wise. It may change in he future.<br />
<br />
The Inquistion are the military faction in this series, and I have to say they’re pretty bland compared to others I’ve seen in shounen. The writer didn’t put in any effort to creating them and it shows:<br />
The newbie- no depth, bland design. The boy doesn’t even have a name. <br />
The vice captain- Same issue. <br />
The only character that stands out is Captain Dragunov. He’s cool, badass and seems to care about his men. <br />
<br />
The villains are generic and poorly written. For example, Konrad is pretty much a mustache twirling, shallow racist.    <br />
<br />
Animation (5/10):<br />
<br />
The animation is pretty medicore, however I despise how bland all the spells look like green sparkles. <br />
<br />
Sound (4/10):<br />
<br />
The opening song is pretty enjoyable, but some of the osts are forgettable. Osts play a big part in the appeal for battle shounens, so that’s disappointing.<br />
<br />
Overall (3/10):<br />
<br />
I didn’t enjoy Radiant for the longest time. I often questioned why I continued watching it. I do believe the show gets better once you get to Rumble Town arc, so I reccomend watching up to there before making your decision whether to continue. <br />
<br />
If you’re looking for another battle shounen where you can kick back and relax then you may enjoy Radiant. It follows the typical shounen troupes and doesn’t try to be anything other than that.

    An Anime series from a French Manga which made me watch it , as it piqued my interest for a refreshing change from the usual japanese manga adaptations. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around a world which is affected by chaos and destruction caused by creatures called as Nemesis who fall from the sky originating from a legendary place of myth called &quot;Radiant&quot;. <br />
<br />
People who survive these creatures get infected and receive abilities and powers and are mostly referred to as sorcerers. These Sorcerers being the only people who can fight back against the nemesis are feared,shunned and persecuted by the rest of the humanity. <br />
<br />
Enters our

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293990">
        Young Hero Seth who is another survivor of Nemesis raised by his mother figure and master, a sorceress named Alma. Seth has a resolve and goal of eradicating all nemesis and bringing peace and resolve between sorcerers and Humanity with his allies, Melie and Doc.<br />
<br />
The setting is of a historical and modern era with background and environment made for a world with all kinds of  people, sorcerers, mysterious creatures mainly the nemesis and other kinds  of magical elements which might remind you a bit of Harry Potter.<br />
<br />
Art is really well made by Lerche studios, detail drawings of character, magic particles and other creatures, bright and vibrant colours with a good finish. quality stuff.<br />
<br />
Being a French adaptation, i am really interested in this.<br />
Story is still yet developing and it will give you the feeling of a general shonen anime like naruto, bleach, fairy tail etc. But it has a unique element to it as well which is good. Also lots of mysteries and plot is getting revealed in a really slow but good and interesting manner so please be a bit patient and do give it some time while watching the series.<br />
 <br />

    Its target audience are most likely children or jung teens but if you get some episodes in its still enjoyable. <br />
<br />
If know that you have some tolerance for not so serious storys go for it if  seinen is your most liked gerne I woun&#039;t recommend it too you.<br />
<br />
It also starts very mediocre like most shounen but I think it will get better with time.<br />
<br />
At the beginning I didn&#039;t liked the characters but that changed over time.<br />
<br />
Its still ongoing and will have more that 20 episodes if you hate to only watch 12 before a series ends.<br />
<br />
Animes/Series that are similar would be Fariy Tail, Wakfu,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296232">
        or Black Clover but it still has its own traits.

    so based on the story so far the anime is about men and woman who control chaos to fight chaos creatures<br />
<br />
my main problem is the mc is bland and most of the normal human characters feel un-redeemable, they essentially treat people who control chaos as alpha stigma barres and that is where the problem starts, so they treat thier protectors like trash until its time for protecting and then there is still a chance they are going to be hurling insults while they are being protected, and the main character is meant to be ok with that, to be fair his goal boils down to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294316">
        i will become the hokage and then everyone will love us and the acceptance of the abuse from the normal people is to the point where some of the villians are just wizards who are tired of being punching bags<br />
<br />
the music feels quite generic too, it feels like you could insert it into most other shonen shows and it would fit ok <br />
<br />
overall i give the show a 5, i&#039;ve seen much worse

    I&#039;ve heard that the manga is different, I don&#039;t know how its different so this will be my critique on the anime alone.<br />
<br />
Radiant had the potential to be something far greater, it even displayed that for a portion of the show, don&#039;t simply look at the score I or anyone else have given it and pass it off as bad. <br />
<br />
Radiant is your basic shonen anime with your pointy haired snot-nosed brat protagonist who wants to save everyone and stop the bad guys. Nothing really unique there. A good chunk of the show is spent dabbling in miscellaneous adventures that don&#039;t add anything to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302270">
        story, this is where most people dropped the show and why Radiant is rated so lowly. I would say Radiant doesn&#039;t actually get to be pretty good until the second arc and the climax of the second arc (which is basically a quarter of the show.) If Radiant had pushed out content as heart-racing and emotionally moving as the second arc did but for the entire show instead of wasting screen-time, then the show would have easily been an 8 or a 9. Radiant very much makes me think of Black Clover in this way, an extremely mediocre and unoriginal start of the show, the setting, and an unneeded time waster of an opening explaining the show to us every episode LOL. But with patience and time you&#039;ll see that there is something more to this show. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can really only commend Radiant on a job well done for about 5 episodes but I still enjoyed this show and am looking forward to the season 2 since it was announced at the end of the last episode. I hope season 2 will continue with the level of content that the second arc ended with. <br />
<br />

    When watching Anime, you do not say to yourself &quot;Maybe this will be trash&quot; rather you say &quot;maybe this will be my kind of trash&quot;. That being said, this is pretty much almost trash. The one caveat is that if you are very new to shounen and aren&#039;t tired of all the tropes and can tolerate this show&#039;s lazy writing then I suppose it&#039;s alright. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s for kids to young people (15 and below) the trope of consequences not being solid enough (kid destroys a ranch and sets off a rampage of cows) and his punishment is cleaning the wall of their residence. Even if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302735">
        the other sorcerer was the one to take the brunt of the blame, the tone of it just screams &quot;for kids&quot;. How they keep smiling in between shots like idiots, or posing in between dire situations, I particularly remember the cows falling on top of each other in neat rows. This show is not meant to be taken seriously but then the protagonist goes serious and says &quot;I want to protect everyone&quot;, how am I supposed to take that seriously if the show by its tone is NOT meant to be taken seriously. In just comes off as &quot;Naruto-ish&quot; but I think this is a fair statement.<br />
<br />
Naruto doesn NOT have monopoly on &quot;I want to protect everyone&quot; but the thing is, when Naruto said it, you believed him. When this dude says it, I&#039;m just bored. Everyone laughs like an idiot, no sense of urgency, then suddenly we&#039;re supposed to take this kid seriously? Yeah, no, doesn&#039;t work like that. <br />
<br />
So if this is your kind of trash, I think that&#039;s great and I&#039;m excited because you are most likely new(ish) to anime and you have a lot to look forward to, to most people tho, this won&#039;t be your kind of trash.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
The show doesn&#039;t take itself seriously at all, but wants us to take the protagonist seriously. So in the end, it&#039;s boring and you won&#039;t care.

    About eps 11 onwards Only the shows starts to become pretty good during the main arc, Not to spoil much, but the early vibe of air-headed happy go luckyish kind of anime is kinda deceptive, it gets intense and starts to introduce some serious and interesting plot. <br />
<br />
The main characters are probably pretty weak in terms of personality. Nothing really interesting about them yet, quite surprisingly the new characters introduced in the Rumble Town arc are able to carry the show better than Seth and Mélie. <br />
<br />
Probably the reason this anime will get a low score, dropped by many viewers and not garner any attention

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300137">
        due to the self cucked boring intros, fillers from the starting 10 eps. <br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s a not bad shounen anime if you can survive past the boring intros and fillers.

    After 14 episodes, it doesn&#039;t feel like any of the characters are too dynamic and that this is going to be another shounen basic show. But I got up to date with the manga translations and the characters actually gain quite a bit of depth rather quickly. Seth is what you&#039;d expect from a kid with a big dream, he&#039;s really basic at first. However, with the way journeys go, he starts to act like he&#039;s seen some things slowly as the story progresses. Melie starts out really annoying too, but once she grows in confidence from hanging around Seth for a bit, she gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298679">
        a good amount less annoying. I feel like it started out weak, but definitely got stronger over the course of a few episodes. By the current release of episode 14, the story is starting to hit its stride. The art is good and the story is pretty good too. Don&#039;t sleep on this,  I wouldn&#039;t drop it too quickly.

    Radiant is one of the rarest anime adaptations. Recently upon making this review, this I believe is one of the only anime adaptations where the source material does not come from Japan<br />
<br />
Radiant is an adaptation of a French manga (manfra) which already is a rare occurrence in anime. Radiant has fantastic world building and storytelling with interesting characters and is one hell of a slow burner anime. Right off the bat, it has a lighthearted tone with its major strong point being comedy and it feels as if it&#039;s a slice of life anime at times. The problem with that is it isn&#039;t attractive, it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338103">
        not too interesting but it&#039;s bearable to watch. The first half though is overshadowed by the series&#039; intense second half, which practically changes almost everything you knew about this show.<br />
<br />
This story is not as generic in the first half as you may think, it&#039;s simply just too lighthearted and not as intense as you want from a Shonen. Seth doesn&#039;t aim to be the best sorcerer unlike many claim, but his motivation is more comparable to the likes of Luffy from One Piece, where in Seth&#039;s case he searches for Radiant. He&#039;s unlikable to a degree, but to an understandable point. He&#039;s been discriminated his entire life due to being an infected person and always on the run with Alma. Seth lacked the proper interaction with other people since he was always feared. The story&#039;s strongest points in the first half though is practically hiding how intense the story is with how lighthearted it goes about things.<br />
<br />
For the first ten episodes of Radiant, do not expect much. It&#039;s a slice of life comedy mixed in with action and world building which becomes every important in the second half of Radiant. The Rumble Town Arc is what makes Radiant good, and the mood completely changes, and it may even shock you a bit. It goes in depth into the injustice for the infected and how they are discriminated. This whole arc is filled to the brim with amazing character development and action. The second half alone makes Radiant a 9/10 story, even if it feels slow in the beginning, I assure you the second half sure as hell makes up for what it lacked.<br />
<br />
Radiant does not have the best animation, it&#039;s average at best. The animation lacks the intensity and fluidity that you want in a fight scene in anime. The art remains consistent throughout the series, and the animation does as well. The best fight in this season has to be Seth vs Konrad, the choreography was very well done, but it lacked the fluidity it needed to truly shine.

    Welcome to my next review. This time I will tackle the anime Radiant.<br />
To start with, Radiant originates from a French manga so it should already be different than Japanese manga, right? Actually, have you not told me it&#039;s originally a French story I would have branded it as just another Japanese adaptation. There is nothing that sets itself apart from Japanese manga. So what is Radiant? Radiant is an anime done by studio Lerche and consists of 21 episodes. (That&#039;s rare, 21 episodes.) Lerche has been and still is a studio that can and has produced very good anime and it is a studio you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302673">
        should know.<br />
<br />
Plot/Story: The story is set in a fantasy-esque world that is threatened by giant zerba-like striped creatures called Nemesis. The only way to successfully kill them is either by the government-like Inquisition or by sorcerers. Sorcerers however are called &#039;infected&#039; because they survived contacts with the Nemesis. They are branded as impure, evil, and contagious. They bring diseases and are all around not really people to begin with. That&#039;s how the regular human views sorcerers, such as our protagonist Seth. The story follows Seth as he sets out on a journey to find the mysterious island Radiant (title giver) where it is said to be the birthplace of all Nemesis. He hopes to destroy Radiant and to eradicate the Nemesis at the root and by doing that that the people stop dehumanizing and hunting down sorcerers like himself. On his journey he meets a few companions and ends up on the sorcerer haven Artemis where sorcerers are not discriminated.<br />
For a story out of a French feather you would expect more than this. What we have here is a fairly typical shōnen plot trope of the Main Character wanting to go place X or become X. While such a thing is not bad in itself, those tropes are story structures you can use as a blueprint and build your story up on that or around it, Radiant does not do such a thing. Party goes to place X to do this and that, arc ends with a potential end villain who has to be defeated. Such  formula is nice and all but it does not hold up on its own. &#039;Go to place X / become X&#039; is a very simplistic formula. Like with other shōnen who use that build they cannot solely rely on that alone and judt let the story happen as they go on that journey. Such stories live off of the character&#039;s story and the sub-plots that may even revolve around the end goal. While I must admit that with only 21 episodes the amount of Story building for a shōnen is limited but you still have to catch the viewer&#039;s attention in order to get them to watch more than that. Radiant fails in that regard. But to that later.<br />
<br />
Art: Even though Lerche can get very pretty this is jot their best work in that regard. The whole anime has some sort of milky film over all colors and it makes it look too soft. For romance or comedy such tactic may be their strength but not for a shōnen. The best animated part is towards the end of the last arc, and I hate to break it to you Radiant, but that&#039;s way to late. Most viewers already turned off and great animation at the end does not bring more viewers, it just pleases those who are still watching (or doing compilations).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: Sound, huh. Standard all up to the last part of the last arc. Yet again like in the art department they increase the great SFX for those 1 or 2 episodes but that&#039;s it. I&#039;m sure the sound was there, I just didn&#039;t realize it. Such a thing can be a strength but only if used on specific occasions to increase the tension or similar things. If the sound effects and music aren&#039;t recognizable for the most part then I also can&#039;t point out anything positive. One thing tho stands out like a fire in the dark. The opening of Radiant, &quot;Utopia&quot;. A very hype and bombastic opening full of adrenaline, all around a great song but wasted on this anime. If for anything at all this show&#039;s OP might get remembered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: Okay, since I don&#039;t want to go into major spoilers, let me out down the later episode characters, primarily the villains. Bland and underdeveloped. That pretty much sums it up. Although I am not going through the characters specifically, I have to say that a certain group at the end lacks charisma and anticipation, which is the fault of them only then appearing. We just dont know anything at all. I know that the story is not over but I have to judge with what I have, and it ain&#039;t look pretty. As for 2 other characters, one of them is heavily cardboard Ed and just evil for the sake of being evil. Sorry, but with such a one dimensional personality you won&#039;t go far (unless you&#039;re MHA and you are mainstream). As for the other one, meh. Too weak. Now for the more centered characters:<br />
Starting of with the least important, Alma. Alma is the foster parent of Seth. To put her in the easiest light, she exists. That&#039;s pretty much it. Nothing of her screams &quot;badass&quot; or &quot;great character&quot;. One of many character you will forget.<br />
Next up is Doc, a researcher of who studies the Nemesis (I think). He&#039;s annoying and that&#039;s all there is to him. His interactions with Miss Melba, a coffee shop owner who he is in love with are equally as annoying to watch as him being alone. All he does is complain to Seth, worry about debts and talking about how great it would be if he marries Miss Melba. I don&#039;t know why he was written this way but it was not a wise idea.<br />
Before going to the next one I&#039;d like to skip that person and switch their places with the first one, meaing now comes the main protagonist Seth. While Seth is similar to goofy and simple-minded shōnen characters he does have some potential to become more aggressive, especially after the last arc that gave him a significant character development, even though that development was a bit iffy in terms of writing. Other than that, the attacks he are countable on one hand and I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s something good or bad. Okay, it&#039;s bad. Why? Because his attacks and moves get very repetitive very fast. Big weak point. And if you know typical shōnen main characters then you also know Seth. <br />
Now onto the last main character that I skipped for Seth, Mélie. I&#039;m gonna say it right now, Mélie is the best character of the entire show, period. The Gimmick she has is that she can switch from her shy and playful nature to a sadistic and aggressive one. So a split personality of some sort. That&#039;s also the best she has going for her, apart from her chest. A change in personality, especially into an aggressive one is always a fun aspect of a character. A lot of development is also not present. Seth is the who get the most development of all of them and that is sad.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and verdict: So, was it an enjoyable series. Not. Really. Radiant is a pretty avarage anime with a terrible start and first half, and such a thing can very easily kill an anime, and that&#039;s what happened here. I actually have no excuse for actually finishing this anime, but now that i have I can close this anime and not touch it again. Sorry, Mélie. Do I recommend it? You an certainly enjoy it but there is far better out there and you are almost as happy as before if you have not watched the series or if you have. And with that cryptic line I&#039;m done with this review. See you in the next one.

    Radiant is a first for me and the anime community in that it is a french manga (yes, apparently they do exist) turned into an anime. This alone compelled me to check out the anime as it was something different. At least, that&#039;s what I initially thought. <br />
<br />
Story - 5<br />
<br />
I thought that with a french manga we would get an original story with a different perspective on the medium we know and love. Instead, I got just another cliche ridden shounen. Which if executed well can turn out pretty good. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times. From the beginning I could tell this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302287">
        was going to be a disappointment as the first episode was probably the most boring first episode of any anime I had seen in recent memory. Now, I&#039;m not one to make knee jerk reactions after one episode so I stuck around to see how the story would play out. As expected they kept the same style at the same sluggish pace. The story for the most part was slow, boring, and what felt like filler even though this is a decently sized series at 21 episodes. Even when the story gets to its &quot;hype&quot; moments later on they still feel underwhelming just because of how the show was handled. So the story was lacking, but there are ways around this.<br />
<br />
Characters - 5<br />
<br />
That way is compelling characters which this story has very few of. Off the bat we are introduced to our main character Seth, a sorcerer, who acts very much like your standard shounen protagonist. His power isn&#039;t very creative either so its not like he stands out from the crowd very much. The side kicks that go alongside our main character have nice designs but personality is lacking. As the series progresses we are introduced to a few more from the cast who in my opinion are far more interesting then our main group. Yet, they don&#039;t stick around for very long but I&#039;m hopeful they will play a more vital role in the future.<br />
<br />
Animation - 7<br />
<br />
I was surprised that a foreign property like Radiant would have some nice animation and art so it was a pleasant surprise. The animation stays consistent for the most part and its easy on the eyes. The characters themselves do not look cookie cutter which I like. They look like they actually have some personality even if that is sadly not the case. Action scenes are decently handled as well. Overall, for a non Japanese manga turned anime the animation was quite good.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
By far and away this is the main reason why you should watch Radiant. The opening song alone is straight fire and instantly gets me hyped for the coming episode. Even if you don&#039;t end up watching the anime, at least watch the opening. The ending song is decent and the voice acting is fine as far as I can tell, but the opening is something else.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 6<br />
<br />
The show started off slow and most of the filler episodes which took up a good bit were  boring, but the content towards the end was decent enough. The characters outside of a couple later on were not very compelling nor was I interested in their motivations or journey. I liked the music and the animation though so maybe I&#039;m just a sucker for a good OP, but overall it was a decent enough watch. I am curious to see where the story will go next as of the time of writing this a season 2 was announced. Here&#039;s hoping for some more compelling story lines. My recommendation would be to check out the opening and then decide from there.

    Story-<br />
The story is clear cut on what the protagonist&#039;s objective is. That can be a good thing but it&#039;s too simple to get me to continue to watch.<br />
<br />
Art-<br />
Art is what i&#039;d expect from a shounen. It&#039;s not bad but not spectacular.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The sound wasn&#039;t too distracting and I&#039;m somewhat in favor of the opening.<br />
<br />
Characters-<br />
The protagonist has an irritating personalty, shows little gratitude, and is so thick headed that it&#039;s sickening. A supporting character is just there for the sake of disruption and the other is there for comic relief.<br />
<br />
These can be good things but there&#039;s not much that makes me love this characters enough to continue.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-<br />
It&#039;s

        not great but I don&#039;t hate. <br />

Just another generic shounen.

    The anime loses all of the charm that helped make the manga as awesome as it is. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say for certain but I think a lot of whats lost here is the very thing that made the manga slightly unique. While manga is typically a japanese art form for comics, its use is not restricted to just the japanese. The original author/artist is French and I think some of the subtleties of that culture come out in the humor and art when reading through the manga. All of those charms are completely lost on this anime and it just feels like a generic action

        anime with little going for it. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d love to see this series be redone by either a French or Korean studio I think, nothing against japanese studios but I cant help but think through out reading the manga how awesome it would be to see an animated adaptation from the likes of studio MIR or Ankama (the publishers of the manga also have an animation studio that did Wakfu and Dofus). <br />
<br />
if you feel like watching, go for it but I&#039;d recommend reading the manga if you&#039;re REALLY interested, other wise maybe watch a better show. <br />

    As someone who discovers the series with the manga, I was quite hyped when I learn that it would be adapted. I try to like it, I mean I consider the manga to be one of the best shonen I&#039;ve read, but na the anime is mediocre and as an adaptation it&#039;s trash. I&#039;m giving it a 5 only because if you consider it as a kids show for a young audience it&#039;s not that bad.<br />
<br />
So the anime follow Seth a sorcerer whose goal is to find the radiant, which is the supposed nest of the nemesis a race of monsters who fall from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305510">
        sky and kill most people they touch. On his quest, he is quickly joined by 2 companions Meli and Doc.<br />
<br />
To begin with some positif:<br />
- The anime look good, be it the environments or the characters.<br />
- sound wise both the opening and ending are really good, and aside from the MC the VA are well choose.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it, the story and character are also probably not that terrible but I can only see them as degenerated versions so who know.<br />
<br />
Concerning the problems:<br />
- the passing is bad <br />
- the characters are rather annoying especially Seth which is your typical shounen MC stupid but sturdy and determine<br />
- It&#039;s cliché everywhere<br />
<br />
And the main problem: it&#039;s one of the worst adaptation I&#039;ve seen, think a mix of Black Clover and Tokyo Ghoul. The tone of the series is way more childish, for example in one of Seth flashback we see other children beating him which trigger his power, in the manga, it&#039;s because they were taking a knife to torture him). That alone it wouldn&#039;t have been much of a problem but combined with the fact that they made every character stupid, add more moral and remove the part which show why people have reasons to fear sorcerers, when you combine all of that it just feels like a version for stupid (or children, it&#039;s kind of the same thing).<br />
The characters really being the worst part, Meli is a different person and Seth now doesn’t develop at all and stay the morron that he is at the begining.  And they add useless filler while slowing the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: you should try the manga and if you need to entertain children for a few hours and want a show a little less stupid than your average kiddy show then that anime could do the job.

    Radiant is a firework you think you&#039;ve seen before, but it turns out it was something different entirely, only for it to burn out quickly. <br />
<br />
Going into this show, I was expecting just the usual. Fantasy magical battle trash, something mindless I could just enjoy. And at first it did seem just like that with some of its lamer episodes and bizarre idea of character design. But once the show moved into its second half, something else reared it&#039;s head and revealed this show understood more than it was letting on. <br />
<br />
Story is pretty simple, nothing incredible but it&#039;s mostly competent at what it does.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302502">
        The story is slow during the first half of the show, mostly focusing on Seth&#039;s growing as a mage and learning something about the world. The second half however starts greying the morality of the characters, opens up new possible ideas and peaks with a monstrous villain and a tragic villain. It&#039;s got potential to continue improving but as it stands, it feels like the jumping off point for something far better. The actual writing is up and down, a lot of the comedic elements tend to fall flat, but there are some standout running gags that continue to be amusing. The story is easily the biggest bar to entry as i&#039;m sure it&#039;ll turn off the more discerning viewer and that is a shame because there is more to unpack than you initially see.<br />
<br />
Art is pretty decent. The spell effects are nice and clear, the animation during fight scenes is pretty good, there&#039;s not too many flubs I could spot but it&#039;s nothing spectacular. It serves the purpose it&#039;s needed for. <br />
<br />
Sound is pretty forgettable. I can&#039;t remember any distinct tracks from it, the voice acting is just fine. I&#039;ve not got a lot to say on it and even the intro i&#039;m already forgetting and getting mixed up with other shows.<br />
<br />
The characters are easily the best part of this show. This anime was adapted from a French manga, (or manfra, idk) and it definitely shows in some of the odder designs but there&#039;s some real standouts among the cast. Whilst at first some of the characters are irritating and simple, they do develop as the story goes, Seth especially becomes a far more endearing character during the second half and whilst he&#039;s definitely not Asta levels of annoying, there&#039;s a lot to be desired. The supporting cast are pretty decent, Doc serves to be a consistent source of good humour and even the villains get larger personalities than i&#039;d expect from a show like this, Black Clover again being a good point of comparison as to how villains usually are in shows like this.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t expect to enjoy this show as much as I did. I must admit I put it off for a good couple weeks due to the nature of the show but when I did get back into it, I was hooked for each week it was on. If you can get through it&#039;s first half and find yourself enjoying the characters and the writing, you&#039;re in for a treat in the second half. <br />
<br />
Radiant is definitely screaming for a second season to really expand it and show off everything it has to offer. I can&#039;t help but feel doubtful it will get one though due to its popularity and that big barrier to entry which is a real shame. If you have any interest in a show with this kind of premise, you&#039;ll enjoy it. If you don&#039;t, you probably won&#039;t be able to push through to when it really starts to shine, so just go at your own pace. <br />
<br />
In the end, Radiant really brought to light with a generic looking fantasy battle anime can do once it spreads its wings and starts to fly.

    I really want to like this show, it does have everything that I look for in anime/manga. A fantasy world, magic systems - and a pretty cool magic system at that. And I think of shonen anime/manga as a comfy and safe genera that I&#039;m always happy to just lose myself in. <br />
<br />
That being said, every time I find myself getting into this story. Getting into the world setup and the plot starting to move along. A character (usually the main, or doc) has to open their mouth and ruin it for me. <br />
<br />
Right now, my only real complaint that&#039;s keeping me from being less

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325933">
        harsh on this show is. The main character is just too dumb. At first I thought he was regular level shonen hero dumb. Which is fine, you learn to love the dimwitted hero with a heart of gold. Or at least I do. But Seth is really pushing the boundary of &#039;naive if not a little slow&#039; to &#039;how does he know to dress himself?&#039; almost to &#039;if he feels hunger pains, does someone still have to tell him to eat?&#039; <br />
<br />
Case in point, it&#039;s season 2 and other characters have to remind Seth what his goal in life is. You know the main plot, his &#039;I&#039;m going to find the one piece/become hokage/catch them all? <br />
<br />
At this point I&#039;ve got 2 or 3 more episodes left in me before I&#039;ll need to take a step back, and if I can&#039;t restart it after a few weeks, I&#039;ll have to mark this as did not finish.

    Story: 2<br />
<br />
The story is meaningless nonsense.  Since this story was originally written by a French person; it could be a misunderstood culture.  They constantly switch between serious and over the top unbelievable comedy.  It&#039;s too bad the serious scenes come off as boring because there is no sense of risk.  The comedy ruins the pacing of the show when used in serious situations, and they do it often.  Also, the jokes are on the level of cringy, puny dad jokes.  A giant kracken just took our friend and will eat him soon.  Lets spend the next few episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325405">
        joking about how funny it is.  The training is completely out of place, badly paced, and the power ups are awkward boring.  He literally had his seven tails power take over his body to rampage.<br />
<br />
Decisions made by the people don&#039;t make sense (For example: Season 2, episode 1; The leader of the army believes his own soldier is the enemy disguise and orders his underlings to fire cannons at it.  Then the not smart guy says, lets wait and see if he can talk.  Turns out he was just a soldier.  The joke falls very flat)  Ex machina nonsense solves problems more than common sense.  This dude uses his My Hero Academy Detroit Smash attack far too much.  His mana gives him God powers randomly and it doesn&#039;t even make sense.  The explanation isn&#039;t satisfying.  He should be able to use his God powers all the time; but plot dictates when he can or cannot use them.  The commoners are either dumber than monkeys, or 99.99% of the world population are racist bigots.  I could go on and on.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
I have low standards, and there are no complaints here.<br />
<br />
Sound:  6<br />
<br />
The English voice actors are fairly bad, but not pure trash.  The translation from French to English may not come out as well.<br />
<br />
Character:  2<br />
<br />
Totally bad.  Not one of the main characters has common sense.  A extremely high proportion of all the characters are complete morons or bigoted racists.  You are better off living with a gorilla than with one of these characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  6<br />
<br />
I had more questions about this show afterwards, then I did while watching it.  Why don&#039;t they show how someone gets cursed?  Why wasn&#039;t the mucus cursed kid contagious and how did he know it was safe?  In reality, 99.9999999% of humans would know mucus, snot, bodily fluids spread disease.  Why isn&#039;t anyone worried about disease in this show?  or is the main character just a complete idiot?  Why does the imperial army employ sorcerers, but simultaneously executes proven good ones without a second thought?  Why would immigrants take a airship to Artimus &quot;trash land&quot; instead of the other 99% better villages around the world?  How could soldiers murder each other with swords and get away with blaming it on non-sword wielding children?  oh, in every episode something moronic happens and the answer is:  NOTHING HAS ANY MEANING AT ALL.<br />
<br />
Overall:  3<br />
<br />
Ya, I watched the entire first season.  Powerful people are scum, and attack the innocent weaklings.  I assume 99.9999% of the towns don&#039;t have their own self defenses; because literally everyone is evil or too stupid to be trusted.
