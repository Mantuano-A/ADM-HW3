    This is seriously one of the largest wastes of my time I have ever seen. I think I&#039;ve established that my time is very fabulous, so I am rather upset about this.<br />
<br />
We have what is one of the stupidest stories ever told. A love triangle between a boy and two girls who think they are his twin and fight over him. Other than the twincest vibe you have going, it&#039;s just plain unrealistic. Which two families/guardians allow their teenage daughters to go trekking across Japan to go looking for a boy? It just is unbelievable. I think there&#039;s something against the law about that sort

        of thing. What do I know? Of course it&#039;s fine to let your kids roam around the countryside looking for a man. Also, why is it so pertinent that they act all lovey-dovey around their &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot;? I suspect the blood bond means nothing to them since they&#039;ve been separated for so long.<br />
<br />
The art is nothing special. The style is pretty dated, and the colouring was a little messy. Nothing exceptional or memorable. I had to struggle to remember what these people looked like after watching this anime. <br />
<br />
Nothing good to say about the sound either--it was average. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, I couldn&#039;t find more cliched ones. Everyone was utterly generic and acted like mindless sacks of meat who act in the most predictable of ways. Why?! That isn&#039;t a good character!<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know who would think this trash is romantic or funny. Oh, ha ha ha, he saw her naked!! WOW. SO FUNNY. Oh, they&#039;re fighting over him, they love him so much, sob sob. OOH, SO HEART-RENCHING. More like vomit-inducing.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch this. Total waste of energy.

    There are teacher fans, and there are Twins fans, and personally I&#039;m more of a Twins fan than a Teacher fan.  I find this anime to be superior in many ways to it&#039;s predecessor.  First it has a smaller cast of characters so there&#039;s no real confusion or wondering what&#039;s going on with each character as in Teacher.  Also the romance that is developed is more...clear.  Teacher is quite confusing because you never really know what level their relationship is at.<br />
<br />
Story: Maiku (Michael) lives on his own, he&#039;s an orphan, but he has a nice job that he worked really hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2800">
        for so that he can remain independent.  His only family is a girl, that he doesn&#039;t know, he just has a baby picture of the two of them playing in an inflatable pool.  He&#039;s living in the house in the picture that he saw in a UFO special on tv (from Teacher).  His life is pretty good until one day a girl shows up claiming she&#039;s his sister.  And she decides that she&#039;s going to live with him because she doesn&#039;t have anywhere else to go, and hey, they&#039;re siblings right?  Maybe not, because another girl shows up claiming again to be Maiku&#039;s sister.  So...which one is it?  The way the characters are set up, and according to their reactions and introductions I knew by the first episode which one was his sister and which one is the one that he was going to fall in love with....but I still enjoyed watching it.  It&#039;s not an amazing story, it&#039;s more just ideas that were thrown together for each episode and it works quite nicely, and it makes the show really cute.<br />
<br />
Art: Everything is colourful.  There are a lot of bright happy colours.  It&#039;s not a bad thing, but it made me feel like the anime was a little too fake.  They never really add too much detail to anything, and the characters seem really flat.  I couldn&#039;t stand the eyes they used in this anime, they just didn&#039;t hold any depth to them at all.  However the art does suit the mood of the piece, as it is a relatively happy anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: Eugh, They use the same opening as Teacher, and if you&#039;ve seen it through teacher you&#039;d probabably had enough of it.  Seeing it again through Twins is absurdly annoying.  The rest of the music is kind of bland and never really stood out in my mind.<br />
<br />
Character: Stereotypes.  It really makes this a typical anime.  Again, based on the characters in the first episode I was able to figure out who was his sister and who was his lover....and I was right too.  I would have liked if they had fleshed out the characters better, instead of having the outgoing one and the shy one who faints when she gets nervous.  If they had really fleshed out the two female protagonists, made them a little more similar but at the same time making them unique the anime would have been thousands of times better.  There&#039;s not much to say about Maiku, other than that he&#039;s pretty much mostly annoyed at their presence but still cares enough about them to not throw them out of his house.  There&#039;s also a gay guy....who, as it turns out, isn&#039;t really gay...if you watch the episode you&#039;ll be incredibly confused.  He provides more than half of the humor in the anime.  Oh and all of the characters from Teacher are seen again.  Ichigo is made into a main character, and she spends all of her time tormenting Maiku....again, she knew the sister right away as well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The anime isn&#039;t great, it&#039;s not superb in any way, shape, or form.  But it&#039;s still enjoyable.  It&#039;s very happy, upbeat, something you watch when you&#039;ve just finished watching something that didn&#039;t make you feel all that great.  <br />
<br />
I would say to watch Teacher first.  If you see Teacher before you see Twins and you enjoy Teacher, then go watch Twins for a more coherent experience.  If you hated Teacher, watch Twins....because if you hated Teacher....you might just enjoy Twins.  That&#039;s confusing, I know...but watching Twins before Teacher just doesn&#039;t make much sense, and a lot of the jokes won&#039;t be the same.

    Introduction<br />
Like many others, I watched this series after I finished Onegai Teacher.  I came in with expectations for the same level of romance and involvement I had with Onegai Teacher, but I was surprised to find out that the two series were shockingly different.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The problem with the story is that it had a very weak hook.  This is not a series where you see love develop like in Onegai Teacher.  Instead, Miina and Karen&#039;s affections for Maiku are very blatant.  Most of the story focuses on their conflict between being in love with Maiku as a brother and as a potential

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5483">
        lover.  This led to a ridiculous amount of misunderstandings and fanservice opportunities.  It&#039;s great if you are looking for an ecchi harem that focuses on twincest, but in reality it lacks the depth and drama to really draw you in.  <br />
<br />
The story gets really repetitive at times and they seem to reiterate the same points over and over again like when they state &amp;quot;We might be relatives....  but we might also be strangers.&amp;quot;  Thoughts like that are so obvious that they did not need to be repeated more than once or at least could have been expressed in different ways.  However, the show starts to pick up in the end so if you can bare the first few episodes you should be satisfied with the way the series ends.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound<br />
I liked the use of the split screens in some of the episodes as well as the slow motion running with the Chariots of Fire-like background music.  However, I did not care for the OP and skipped it for the most part.  <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Although the two series share many of the same characters, it seems that they have different personalities and roles in each series.  In Onegai Twins, Mizuho played a large supporting role as the meddling, ditzy teacher.  That is in stark contrast to the more wife-centered romantic role she played in Onegai Teacher.  However, it was still nice to see her involved in the anime and she does provide some fanservice.  Other characters like Ichigo and Matagu took on larger roles in this series than they did in the previous one.   Ichigo is the student body president who continues to meddle in the love affairs of the students and Matagu is a perverted older brother.  <br />
<br />
As for the new characters, I find them to be on the weak side.  It&#039;s nice that Maiku isn&#039;t a weak, wimpy character but I didn&#039;t buy into his strong, silent type of character.  He spent most of the series trying to hold back his feelings and that seemed to stop his character from developing.  In addition, Miina and Karen weren&#039;t very attractive female leads in my opinion.  They fell for him too easily and their histories were not very interesting.  However, to be fair, the heart of the series is really how much all three of them care for each other and have become their own little family.  In that respect, watching the bonds between these characters grow was an important and pleasant part to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
I think people will enjoy this anime if they are watching it for the right reasons and come in without high expectations.  It&#039;s not a very dramatic, hard to follow, romantice series.  Instead it is a light-hearted portrayal of a group of strangers who become family.  There are a lot of ecchi moments and you can&#039;t go one episode without nudity.  Also, sometimes the episodes are so stupid they are funny.  So if you are just looking for something to pass the time then I think you will really enjoy this anime, but if you are looking for real romance then I would probably look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
If you watched the first series, you can&#039;t go wrong watching Onegai Twins, but do not expect the same kind of story.  However, if you are looking for easy watching with some feel good moments and a happy ending then I would recommend this anime.

    Please Twins has to be one of the most controversial comedy-romance harem (or love triangles) that has ever been talked about. Please Twins has been throughout either you love it or hate it. And on a side note, you do not HAVE to watch Please Teacher to watch this (even though it does help out with characters that have a supporting role [Ex.: Mizuho and Ichigo]). I would suggest to watch Please Teacher first, but if you don&#039;t want to it&#039;s not going to kill anyone. <br />
<br />
Story- Basically the story is about a young man named Maiku Kamishiro, who&#039;s mother left him as a child

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16279">
        and was sent to an orphanage. The mother left him with a picture of Maiku in a pool with someone else with him, supposedly his sister. Though he is curious he moves on with his life and goes to school and works as a computer programmer. Later on, a young girl named Miina Miyafuji comes to the house the picture is (where supposedly Maiku leaves the orphanage to live in that house) and tells Maiku that he is his sister. They both have the same picture of them in the pool and they both have the uncommon hazel eyes, so it is thought that they could be siblings. Later that night, another girl comes to the house, Karen Onodera, who also has the same picture and the hazel eyes as well. Basically it comes down to one of them being his sibling, and one of them being a stranger. Later as the series progresses, Miina and Karen both fall in love with Maiku, so now when they find out who is the sibling only one of them can have a relationship with him.<br />
<br />
The story is unique, but what annoyed me is that somehow it&#039;s a &quot;coincidence&quot; that Karen and Miina meet Maiku the same day. It&#039;s like what happens in other romance animes, so it really was average to the start. What else annoyed me is that every episode the whole &quot;one of us is a sibling and one is a stranger&quot; is brought up EVERY episode and it becomes annoying like you don&#039;t want to hear about it. What else turns people completely off about this series is that since both Miina and Karen are in love with Maiku, there is an incest coupling. When I watched it it really never mattered seeing how they&#039;re sort of strangers, so I can&#039;t blame them. If you&#039;re creeped out by this, you shouldn&#039;t watch the show. I thought the story could&#039;ve brought more than it did. Please Teacher did a great job than what I expected, so I wanted more.<br />
<br />
The art itself was pretty decent in my opinion, and I do believe the ending theme&#039;s animation was really good. Seeing how Please Teacher&#039;s art was good and now after they have more money to spend, the animation budget would be bigger and the art did not disappoint.<br />
<br />
I do believe that the opening and ending themes were really good, and the score for the show was really good, too. KOTOKO did great on making the lyrics and the performance was really done well. If you want to know which one&#039;s better, personally I would say the ending theme is.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters in the series were average, and none of them except one stood out. I&#039;m glad Maiku isn&#039;t a pansy and anything that happens doesn&#039;t make him go all hay-wired insane and perverted like most male harem leads. Though I must say I&#039;m not a fan the the smart, silent type. Miina, in my opinion, is a slut. She goes after Maiku about everything. There are other things later on, but I won&#039;t spoil. Karen is cute, but even so she is really shy and seeing how if anything that suprises her makes her faint, and I do find that annoying. It was nice to see some of the characters in Please Twins make a comeback role in the series. Mizuho was great but more light-headed than before and makes her seem more stupid. The only character that I thought was good was Ichigo. Seeing how she wasn&#039;t really active in Please Twins and her making a comeback and shows she actually is a good character definitely made Please Twins more enjoyable. <br />
<br />
You can&#039;t like a series unless you enjoy it, and I think the only reason that I kept on watching and ending up liking Pleases Twins was because I enjoyed it. The romance made you think how it would turn out which kept you hooked and ready for the next episode. The comedy in the show is way better than Please Teacher had, so the show definitely has its laughs. <br />
<br />
Thinking about Please Twins, the show definitely had its flaws, but if you don&#039;t think about the flaws that much you might end up enjoying it. This show has its fans and its haters, and both really fight about if the show is good or not and why. This show is for sure either a hit or a miss. If you don&#039;t think about its flaws too much, it is a hit. If you keep the flaws all in your mind, it will be a miss. Hopefully you check out this series because I thought it was decent. Thank you for reading.

    Upon finishing &quot;Onegai Twins&quot;, I wanted to laugh like a madman, and jump up and down in sheer joy... because finally, there were no more of this sh*tty show to watch!<br />
<br />
&quot;Onegai Twins&quot; is about a highschool student Maiku, who has the misfortune of having a couple of annoying girls show up at his door one day, both claiming to be his twin sister. Of course, the girls end up moving in with him, and you end up with the usual dipsh*t comedy of errors that we&#039;ve all come to expect from harem comedies.<br />
<br />
In case you haven&#039;t guessed already, &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; is made by the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39569">
        &quot;geniuses&quot; who brought us the &quot;masterpiece&quot; that is &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;. Unsurprisingly, they share a similar feel, but there are some differences to be found. &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; contains considerably more fanservice in the form of nudity, and it also has a more down to earth story (both metaphorically and literally, since it doesn&#039;t involve aliens). Other than that, it&#039;s pretty much the same sort of thing, so it surprises me that this series isn&#039;t nearly as popular as &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, considering perverse student-teacher fantasy that is found in &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, what can we expect from &quot;Onegai Twins&quot;? The obvious answer is er, obviously incest... and lo and behold, &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; delivers exactly that! The concept behind the story of &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; may not be nearly as bad as &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, but it&#039;s still pretty bad. You can tell that it&#039;s basically Perverted Fantasy Part Deux from the same guy&#039;s head, this time uncut, so you get to see the pr0n too.<br />
<br />
The story of &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; is full of holes, with a lot of stuff either not explained, or badly explained. For example the reason given for one of the characters Karen leaving home on her own is complete bull, as is the reason for another of the characters turning gay - the last time I checked, people don&#039;t exactly make a conscious decision to become gay. But arguably, the biggest plot hole of all is how they reach the conclusion about being part of a pair of twins. First of all, why twins? Given that they&#039;re obviously not identical twins, what makes them think they&#039;re twins rather than normal siblings? Then there&#039;s the issue of the irrefutable evidence that is used in the twins assessment - the blue eyes the candidates have in common. Even in a more realistic situation, this is scarcely convincing - it&#039;s not like their eyes are an amazingly rare shade is it? A heck of a lot of western people have blue eyes. But also, given that they&#039;re in a story where one girl has green hair, another has pink hair, and the guy has purple hair, somehow having blue eyes does not seem like such an important detail... if it ever was. I noted that though they made a big deal about having same coloured eyes, no one gave any thoughts to the differing, weirdass hair colours. Talk about only seeing what you want to see and jumping wildly to conclusions!<br />
<br />
While the worst aspect of &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; is the story, that honour goes to the characters in the case of &quot;Onegai Twins&quot;. The characters are so bad that to call them &quot;lame&quot; would be like paying them a compliment. Like &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, the characters stinks of fakeness, though perhaps they don&#039;t smell as bad, since they&#039;re driven by a less contrived story at least. But overall, the characters are worse simply because there are too many offputtingly perverted characters in this offputtingly perverted show. <br />
<br />
I almost feel sorry for the main protagonist Maiku, who seems to be the only down to earth character in the crazy cast. The Girl With Monotonous Voice makes a return in &quot;Onegai Twin&quot;, much to my dismay. Luckily she doesn&#039;t have as many lines as she did in &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; and, to be fair, she seems to have developed a more devious personality and an evil laugh, which redeems her character slightly. The award for the most annoying characters in the cast should probably go to Karen, as those cat noises that she makes nearly drove me over the edge of sanity. Another one of the returning characters is the ship control system Maria. Maria was kept under tight control in &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot; - understandably so, as given the circumstances, letting a crazy little thing like that running around would be the very opposite to being discrete. This makes it even more puzzling then, that it appears to have been given a license to roam in &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; for no reason that I can see. But I must admit it has grown on me slightly, so this didn&#039;t annoy me as much as it could have.<br />
<br />
The mono/dialogues in &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; are highly repetitive, even more so than in Onegai Teacher, at least in the first half. A large chunk of the script comprises the line &quot;We could be family! But we could be strangers...&quot; and variations on that line. So after a couple of episodes, you can start predicting about half the dialogues that goes on. Around the mid way point though, the script writers must have rewatched the crap they made and thought to themselves &quot;holy sh*t this is repetitive! We better get off our lazy asses and come up with some new lines!&quot; Cos after that, those over used lines suddenly became an endangered species, appearing only once or twice more for the remainder of the series.<br />
<br />
Like &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, the major strength of the anime is the music. The opening theme&#039;s is catchy, and again, the quality of the rest of the music was several leagues above that of the main content of the anime. However, the voices of the characters bring down the score for in the sound department for being annoying. The art looks to me to have improved considerably compared to &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, with the colours being particularly vibrant (although this could be due to those exotic hair colours). <br />
<br />
To its credit, &quot;Onegai Twins&quot; does end rather strongly (just like &quot;Onegai Teacher) - I quite enjoyed the last couple of episodes, and there&#039;s a nice twist at the end too. Overall, I judge it to be slightly better the &quot;Onegai Teacher&quot;, but I appear to be one of the few who does.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, as a final thought, with all this teacher-student marriage and incest love triangles etc going on, just what kind of f*cked up school is this?!<br />

    For Onegai Sensei, there&#039;s a listlessness that Kei Kusanagi feels after the time he loses through his standstill. His friends left him; he is stuck. His everyday is broken through Mizuho, and through their fake marriage the two find belonging through each other.<br />
<br />
I think if we go to Mihkail Bakhtin’s idea of the Chronotope, we can find how space is manifest. Bakhtin’s Chronotope - roughly speaking - is about space and time are linked. Matt (RCAnime) has used the example of Penguindrum to show how space literally manifests time. Using that Chronotopic relationship, we can see a very similar relationship with Onegai Sensei.<br />
<br />
However, it’s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244271">
        two-part relationship. The town in which they stand is a standstill, manifestation of Kei’s condition. However, the town is penetrated by Mizuho, whose otherness is cast very quickly in the first two episodes. From then, Kei’s relationship to Mizuho reveals bits and pieces of the town. Kei’s sensation of time rips itself from the town in which they live. Bakhtin’s Chronotope is about space and time, but Onegai Sensei is more specifically about that space manifest in bodies.<br />
<br />
So why is this important to Onegai Twins? Well it’s an inversion of the general idea of ‘bodily’ Chronotope as presented in Onegai Sensei, but it arrives at the same basic conclusions. Onegai Twins’ Kamishiro is not ‘stuck’ in the town, but rather he is drawn there. He moves to the town that ‘doesn’t move’, but the act of moving there is ironically shattered when he comes across Karen and Miina. <br />
<br />
And yet, once again we see how the Chronotope plays out. After all, what draws them back? It’s the photograph. Material objects in the space of the story draws them back to the space. There, they attempt to recapture lost time. On a surface level, this might not be too far off from Kei’s situation: he lives in that town to ‘recapture’ lost time, doesn’t he? How is Kamishiro so different?<br />
<br />
Because Kamishiro’s lost time is penetrated by two girls, not one. Instead of a linear, singular progression that removes the stasis, Karen and Miina double the narrative complexity. They are two girls, representing both old relations and new beginnings, they establish the two narratives of romantic and familial love. They connection Onegai Sensei’s bodily Chronotope to the town’s spatial Chronotope.<br />
<br />
And that’s why Onegai Twins is a simple, yet phenomenal show. Onegai Sensei&#039;s bodily &#039;Chronotope&#039; is subsumed and reconstituted with classical space-time in Onegai Twins.<br />
<br />
PS. I gave everything a 1 because I do not believe in giving out numbers.

    I didn&#039;t expect much from this series. I was really just looking for something to pass the time with as well as a decent anime. Well, my expectations were COMPLETLY wrong. I rushed throught it in three days (somthing I only do with VERY good animes) and was eager as to what would happen next. The story was great and the characters were real and I was able to relate to them. There are things to figure out and misteries about Karen, Mina, and Miku&#039;s past are uncovered. <br />
I&#039;d say a good anime for mature people because it does contain some fan-service, but overall it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24636">
        was very good and one of my favorite animes of all time.

    This was so much more than I expected. A harem romance/comedy from 2003 – virtually unheard of to my ear and rarely spoken about on random anime recommendation threads.<br />
<br />
I was jarred at first by the artstyle – which I found aged, although not without its own charm. However, by the end of the first episode, it had stopped being an issue for me and I was able to enjoy it for what it was.<br />
The series focusing on Maiku and two potential sisters, Karen and Miina and I found myself falling in love with the three of them. The characters had depth, struggles and were impacted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335387">
        by their past – something they were striving to move past and grow from. <br />
<br />
Outside the main trio – the supporting characters were reasonably bland. We had the teacher who at least initially acted like a potential love interest. Then we had Tsubaki the student counsel vice-president and even Maiku’s friend Kousei all as potentials. Of these supporting characters, only Kousei receives any real development – the others are used as plot devices, moving the story forward or giving the main characters a reason to react.<br />
<br />
As the series progresses it is obvious who the two true love interests are – and of that we hope it will be resolved with one being named the sister and the other free to pursue her love. It does seem the writer was trying to play it a little safe – and have Maiku react appropriately towards the sister, while allowing his romantic feeling to grow for the ‘stranger’, but there was still enough doubt to hold the viewers interest to see what the ultimate outcome would be. And we were not disappointed. That there was a resolution at all, I was grateful for – I would have felt cheated if there was no definitive sister and stranger. Especially after hearing it mentioned in almost every episode, multiple times.<br />
<br />
Of the three main characters, I felt Karen developed the least – there was more time and effort on the development of Miina and Maiku. However, Karen still got the first kiss and was able to grow enough to admit her love to Maiku and became responsible enough to hold down a part time job while going to school. Miina was able to let go of some of her insecurities and open up about her past – and ultimately recognize the change in herself and admit her growing feelings to both Maiku and Karen. Maiku was able to give the lobe he so desperately wanted to give and come to understand that life is not just about serious work and school – but there is time for fun and romance as well.<br />
<br />
Now I’m not saying this series was brilliant and without flaws, however, I still rated it an overall nine, primarily for the emotional response it was able to elicit from me. I was able to move past the flaws, although I recognize that some people may not be able to. But I was able to become invested in the characters struggles and root for them – which is all I want from any story. I will add it did grate on my ear hearing ‘we might be relatives…we might be strangers’, over and over again – but I felt it did serve to highlight the inner turmoil the characters were going through. If I was in the position of the characters, I believe that I’d be struggling with that issue on a daily basis. It would play on my mind – as it played on theirs.<br />
<br />
And not to forget this is a harem – in typical harem fashion, we can expect to see a reasonable amount of fan service – and this series didn’t stray to far from that premise. We had the beach scene, we had the accidental kiss scene, we had naked bath scenes (almost every episode!), regular panty peek scenes, and we had the characters interreacting with each other in various states of dress. Check, check and check. Did this detract from the story? I felt it didn’t – but I felt much of it was not necessary to the enjoyment of the series.<br />
<br />
Overall – I’d class this as a hidden gem – and I’ll make the recommendation of watch to whoever will listen. It is right up there with my favorite harem’s and the fact it has a resolution makes me give it two thumbs up. Give it a try – but come with an open mind.<br />

    The plot is pretty interesting at first but I must say that it wasn&#039;t that special. It&#039;s pretty much your &amp;quot;short anime&amp;quot;. No &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot; until the final two episodes really. But the story is rather nice, although I must say you could watch the first two episodes and the final two and you wouldn&#039;t really have missed out. Good idea... but could have gone better <br />
<br />
The art/animation is pretty normal, I&#039;m no pro on this subject but after all the series I&#039;ve watched I&#039;ve found out this is just normal. Nothing special, not bad.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty good. Alright opening which I didn&#039;t mind watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3533">
        and the ending was not bad. I liked one song in the anime itself and searched the web for it.<br />
<br />
The chars were interesting. It&#039;s your typical setup. The clumsy guy, innocent girl and a bad ass (although not as much as your typical &amp;quot;bad ass&amp;quot; girls) girl. There are also other side characters which I found very funny and there are no unlikeable characters to be honest. The main characters developed well and I was happy with the outcome.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a decent watch, no rewatch value at all in my opinion, the show just tries to be too dramatic and fails. I usually like dramas and I am a big Kanon fan for example. If you&#039;ve seen Onegai Teacher you will probably want to watch this one to.

    This anime started good at first, but then the story started to revolve around childish things such as not letting a man have his space, testing him to see whether he was gay when he is trying to do his work, creating fake applications and saying you&#039;re 18 to get a job(illegal), and misunderstandings after misunderstandings after EVEN MORE misunderstandings. This anime is seriously revolved around misunderstandings. Mind you, all anime have misunderstandings in them, and they are annoying from time to time and I for one don&#039;t like them. But to say this anime has misunderstandings in it is an understatement. &quot;Girl&#039;s falling down

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91805">
        on a chair and you grab her to keep her from falling&quot; : Calls you a pervert. &quot;You spill a hot drink on your pants and for some reason go outside of your tent to unzip your pants&quot; : Was getting it on with the girl  whose shirt happens to be undone. Seriously, is it SO much to ask for ONE scenario where the man actually, oh, I don&#039;t know, explains the situation instead of going &quot;oh... well this is...&quot; Miina always runs away for no fucking reason whatsoever and Karen always passes out and nobody bothers to send her to the hospital for this serious illness she has. The logic combined with the humor still leaves the most sour of all sour tastes in my mouth. To say I wanted to punch my screen while watching this series is an understatement. The whole plot is beyond childish. Looking at, for another example, two support characters going out, mind you, GOING OUT, and at the end of the date, the man kisses the woman, and she literally SHUNS him for life and heads over to liking another boy. What does shun in this example mean you ask? Slaps him (let me remind you: DATING), runs away, goes to pretending to like another boy for months on end, and then makes the man apologize to her for her own mental problems. All in all i&#039;m glad I finally finished this anime. Side note, that music that&#039;s always playing for 2 minutes on while showing a slideshow of whats happening is very annoying. I do not recommend this anime to anyone who hates misunderstandings or 10 year old main characters. Though this was in made in the 2000 era, so i&#039;ll give it a small pass for that.

    In the anime/manga world there are many, many stories like this one:<br />
<br />
One guy with a group of girls and he&#039;s forced to choose the one he likes most. Now, Onegai Twins had a different twist for which I give it credit for but unfortunately it was not enough to save this horrible anime.<br />
<br />
I found the story to be mundane, your everyday &quot;Which girl do I like?!&quot; story where there was no spark, no flame, nothing to hold it above any of the others I&#039;ve seen like it. Simply put it was extremely boring. You can find another just like it if you watch Green Green

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36178">
        or Ichigo 100%. If you don&#039;t want to be bored then I recommend you find something else to watch.

    Warning:  Please Twins is a direct spin off of Please Teacher. Some events in Please Teacher are mentioned in Please Twins. If plan to watch this show or read this review watch Please Teacher followed by Please Twins. <br />
Note: for the sake of time and since I’m using MS word for this review I will refer to Maiku Kamishiro (the male lead) as Mike, since he referred to that name in the series many times. Also there is synopsis; sorry I really tried to write the review without it.<br />
<br />
Story-   <br />
This story takes place in the quiet town as before only the focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41019">
        is only a different kind of romance. The male lead name is Mike Kamishiro, a boy whose mother abandoned him and was sent to an orphanage.  The only clue to his past was a picture of him and girl who is supposedly is sister in a pool with a blue house in the background.  He is now living there allow as student and part time programmer. Soon two girls arrive, both claiming to be his twin sister. The only proof is that they have same unusually colored eyes as him, and both are in possession of that same picture. A deal is soon made; they both can stay until they know for sure who the sister is and who is not.  As time goes by both the girls start to develop feelings for Mike and vice versa. This story tells how they go about dealing with those feelings knowing that one or both of the girls can either be his sister or a complete stranger.  This leads to a series of funny adventures and lots of misunderstandings between the three. <br />
However, I feel that the main story arc did get stretched out more than I would have liked. It pretty much takes the entire series to determine who the twin is. After that their relationships don’t really change that much than in the beginning. I would have like to have seen more of what would have happened if the discovery was made sooner and the other girl had more time to pursue Mike. <br />
Note: As far as echhi content is concerned, Please Twins delivers where others (like Love Hina and Please Teacher) seem to have failed.<br />
Sound/Art-   As far this category goes the animation is good. I was able to view this from a good streaming source so the quality was better than that of Mega Upload (stay away from this source). The series uses the same opening soundtrack as Please Teacher which was okay. The other music in my opinion seemed to fit well with the situations. The voice actors from the original series reprised their roles, if they were allowed lines. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters-  <br />
The two female leads in this series are polar opposites. Karen is a shy, reserved and polite girl, versus Miina who is more energetic and outgoing. These characters do play well off each other as they compete for Mike’s attention.  I found myself constantly guessing if anyone these girls could be his sister. <br />
This anime has some of the characters from Please Teacher as supporting characters. Some make appearances in almost every episode, some with a line or two, while others only make small cameo appearances. The only two who have any real roles or involvement in plot development are Ms. Kazami and Ichigo. <br />
They do however change the betrayal of two of the Please teacher characters, but I’ll let you watch and see which two those were.<br />
Overall - <br />
Overall I give this series a solid 8, it had some flaws but overall it was a good watch. Between Teacher and Twins, I did like this one better. I plan on maybe re-watching this series at later date.<br />

    Ah, the ugly child of Please Teacher. People give it crap because it doesn’t base itself off the main characters of Please Teacher but a separate story all together with characters from the main series showing up every once in a while.<br />
<br />
The show is about two twins trying to find each other and one person that is a stranger to them. All three children were drawn together by a picture of two children near a house – one a boy and the other is a girl. The only identifying feature of the two children is their beautiful deep blue eyes. Unfortunately, all three of them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90405">
        have that same unusual color and are drawn to the house when they see it on the news after an ‘alien UFO sighting’ that happened during Please Teacher. As the three live together, they feel romantic to the others but are pledged with the burning question of if they are related. This pretty much means you have a lot of rather ‘incest’ going on.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about the characters, Mike is well, an asshole. He’s harsh but that’s to be expected when he’s lived alone and was abandoned by his parents. He works hard to try and keep food on the table and the home he lives in. Also, all the damn girls swoon over him. I don’t know why because he’s an unlikable person. He’s mature in certain areas but when it comes to people, he’s a real jack ass most of the time. He seems to be the only one that actually thinks Marie is weird.<br />
<br />
Miina is a really energetic and athletic type of character who doesn’t care much for people trying to hurt others. On the other side though, she’s pushy to the point of even pushing Mike to let her stay at his place. She jumps to conclusions really fast and it’s easy to tick her off without trying to.<br />
<br />
Karen is a rather sweet young girl. She is very polite but has a bad habit of fainting whenever she gets to excited. It makes things really awkward and worse is the idea that she might be related to him just as Miina might be. She is normally dazed and confused most of the time too. Also, it never helped that in episode 3, there is a big misunderstanding with the group. You will see when you get to it.<br />
<br />
The other characters really don’t stand out that well, they all pretty much fall into basic stereotypes. We have Kousei who is are ‘gay’ friend, Tsubaki who is are vice-president of the student body and second love interest (first for how long they know each other and third if you count the relative), the clueless teacher Mizuho, Ichigo who pretty much is the rather pervi and troublemaker type of girl.<br />
<br />
The show is standard and just all feels bland. The jokes sometimes come off unfunny or just plain pervi. At least in Please Teacher, it had a bit more class and was a bit more mature but this comes off as just immature. It’s like we are given a fart joke where someone farts and we laugh about it. Actually, the only thing that was actually really fun is when Kousei gets hit before actually being warned.<br />
<br />
The animation is really lack luster, feeling even worse then Please Teacher. It’s lack luster and just doesn’t stand out at all making me want to score it even lower.<br />
<br />
The English voices are pretty much a miss. All the characters really feel forced and sadly, even some veterans in the dubbing business, like Crispin Freeman, feel as though they are just bland.<br />
<br />
I would say it’s pretty much a mistake that this was created because I don’t even think there was a manga created before it so they pulled the show out of their ass.

    Please twins wasnt one of my favorite animes ever, nor would it crack the top 10, or 25 for that matter. The problem with this is that the story which had great possibilties at the start really just suffers from redundancy, and the fact that anyone who watches is probably more interested in the &quot;please teacher&quot; cast more than the one cooked up for this show. <br />
So yeah the story, 3 orphaned children who happen to believe that they have the same mom, oh and that they are twins... so at this point anyone who can do math can figure out what the problem facing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review84611">
        the cast is going to be, the twins and the awkward 3rd wheel. <br />
Maiku(michael/mike) is one of the twins and is the one that the two girls move in with and they spend the entire season trying to figure out who the twin is, even though they are all attracted to each other so this is where the awkward part comes in. On the side we have the senpai who is apparently into him as well and the potentially gay dude, so yeah maiku is apparently the hunkiest piece of man meat since Fabio! <br />
The characters themselves are interesting enough, but a word of warning; if you plan on watching this in english be prepared for karin onedara to sound like Butters from South Park... <br />
Honestly its an okay anime, I mean it keeps you watching the whole time, but personally I found myself getting bored by it towards the end, but that could just be me though...

    A complete and utter waste of time. Especially Love alliance was a pain in the ass. Almost had to quit in the middle. Certainly could have been made better. I think it can be watched with joy if you like sisters who sounds annoying and act like morons. If you must watch this series prepare to be 10y old once again, or be so drunk that you don&#039;t remember anything. And if you think that it must be good because Onegai teacher was, in that case you are wrong. Only good thing in the series was that there is only 12 episodes.

A spin-off sequel to Onegai Teacher, Onegai Twins is, by far, compared to its prequel, much more light-hearted than the complex (not much though) Onegai Teacher. It&#039;s a funny anime series which you, if you happen to be a fan of romantic comedies, will probably enjoy. Do not place high expectations on this anime though, for you may end up a little dissapointed.<br />
<br />
Story: Basically, the story is about a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11642">
        boy, Maiku Kamishiro, living by himself in the same setting as Onegai Teacher. A youngster with a mysterious past, the only clue to who is family might be is an old photo showing two children, him and an unknown girl playing outside in a small pool, on a blue house&#039;s yard. He moves to that same house, and finds a job as a computer programmer, while trying hard to keep up with his studies. However, his life has a turnaround when two different girls, Minna Miyafuji and Karen Onodera, each one of them carrying the same photo that he has and claiming to be his twin sisters, thus moving in with Maiku, until the mystery is uncovered. In addiction, the three of them have the same eye colour. Who is after all, Maiku&#039;s sister? However, in the end, both girls end up falling in love with him, but, because the truth to their relationship is not known, are in a predicament of wanting to discover their past against the risk of losing their romantic interest.<br />
I find this story, although appealing to our curiosity which is a good point about it, to be somewhat lame. In the end, it turns out to be pretty predictable too. And the background isn&#039;t well developed. Unless you watched Onegai Teacher first, you will not understand some things that take course on the plot. So I suggest you watch Onegai Teacher before passing on to this series. Not only that, but also the protagonists&#039; background! The story loses some points because of that. Many animes with better stories than this one. There are a few stories with worse stories than this one too...<br />
<br />
Art: Nothing special really. Nor good, nor bad, just plain mediocre. Perhaps a little less worked out than in its prequel. It&#039;s a pity though. The art isn&#039;t the main asset of this anime show.<br />
<br />
Sound: Passing on to the sound. And my personally favorite part of this series! In my opinion, both the Opening and Ending Theme are great! Specially the Ending. A really nice song, meaningful lyrics and entracing melody and good rhythm. Take some time to listen to these songs. It&#039;s a shame though, we&#039;re talking about only two of them. The background musics are also pretty good. The favorable part about this series, without a doubt.<br />
<br />
Character: I wish I could say the same about the characters though. Like I mentioned before, their background is not very developed. And they aren&#039;t the most original characters in the world. Maiku, the tough and stoic guy, Karen, a shy and polite girl and her opposite polo, Minna, an outgoing and energetic girl. Typical &amp;quot;love-triangle characters&amp;quot;. Also, if you watched Onegai Teacher, remember the characters? Well, they&#039;re back! And... not better than ever. Ichigo Morino was a delight though. A charming dark sense of humour which gives life to this plot. Yet they made the characters from the prequel differently in this plot, and what&#039;s the idea of turning the quiet Matagu, into a pervert trying to get involved with his sister?! Pretty twisted... What&#039;s his interest after all? He should get a life. The supporting characters are not very appealing either. Far from the ideal anime crew.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Last but not least, the enjoyment. Though this series is full of flaws, it&#039;s light-hearted and funny to see their small disadventures through their life together. Also, the drama, though it might seem shallow and lame, give this anime a serious touch, which however ends up blurred by its comic relief. You will have some laughs, and, if you&#039;re the &amp;quot;hopeless romantic&amp;quot; type of person, you may cry in the end, which I doubt. The important about this series isn&#039;t the story, nor the excellency of characters, nor the art. It&#039;s about humour. A series best fitted to be watched during Summer, when school is over (a lot of chocolate helps too, you&#039;ll see!).<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10 (Fair)

    It&#039;s been said before that there are Twins fans and Teacher fans. In the first few episodes of this show, I was thinking, &amp;quot;man, this is way better than Onegai Teacher.&amp;quot; And the first few are. They&#039;re actually really funny and look like a buildup to a great romance. Then, it starts to suck. The same situations repeat over and over, it stops being funny, and the characters REALLY got on my nerves. It&#039;s like this all the way through the end.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
It&#039;s actually a clever idea, and a lot could have been done with it. Quite liked it.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
It&#039;s the same as Onegai Teacher - all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9478">
        bright colours. It&#039;s nothing special, but it&#039;s pretty enough.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The score was pretty good in parts, and the voice acting was definitely quality.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
Probably the worst part for me. Especially during the last few episodes, the characters got infuriating. The male lead is brusque and never really shows any emotion. (This makes me wonder why women are falling all over him.) The girls he&#039;s living with are annoying, indecisive, and overly emotional. Do you like characters who act like idiots in all situations, ignore reason in favour of being whiny, practically push away the people around them, and seem to hate themselves with a passion because they injured themselves a few years ago? &#039;Nuff said.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
First few episodes, as I&#039;ve already said, were pretty damn good. The ending wasn&#039;t bad, either. However, if I could go back in time, I probably wouldn&#039;t watch this again.

         At first, it seems like an interesting story. I liked the music, but that was all I found tolerable about it. The sexual content in this one is terrible, and since this anime is all about relationships, it kind of ruins the whole thing. Don&#039;t bother watching, in my opinion.

    It&#039;s your typical harem anime, it&#039;s kind of good and bad. I could not continues watching after episode 6 because it got weird. It&#039;s similar to &quot;One of Them is My Younger Sister!, Who is&quot; I&#039;m not into those kind of romance which is why I stop. Just keep an open mind about it.<br />
<br />
Art: It&#039;s a little bit dated but during the time of it release it&#039;s considering to be decent at the time. <br />
<br />
Story: It&#039;s has an interesting story and setting.<br />
<br />
Character: I like the main character because he is reliable and independent. He&#039;s not your typical good-for-nothing/pervert. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;m impress because it&#039;s not easy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164719">
        to impress me. The comedy element is strong, I love every second of it but the drama kill it.<br />
<br />
Overall: If you&#039;re looking for okay comedy/harem you might like this.<br />

    Introduction: I enjoyed, and thought that it was creative to have a story centered around a search for a sibling. All three main characters were searching for something more in there lives and it is beautiful how it all plays out.<br />
<br />
Story: Three orphans looking for more belonging and acceptance in life have a faithful meeting. Two girls and a boy, one girls a stranger while the other is Maiku&#039;s ( said Mike in English) sister. the fun in this anime for me was trying to figure out which girl was his sister and see all the misunderstandings , funny, silly, and heart warming interactions between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review345997">
        the three main characters. I thought the anime did a great job on how they showed the mixed emotions the three had for each other and how it is all resolved is heart warming. A romance, and slice of life. It has it flaws but is a good gem of a story that can be overlooked. Funimation has the OVA 13th episode I recommend watching it to get a more full understanding of the anime. <br />
<br />
Art: This anime did come out in 2003 so it has a older type art style to it. I thought it was good overall. To newer anime, and bigger named anime it is not nearly as good. The facial expressions were good and showed the emotions of this unique anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening &quot;Second Flight&quot; is very nice. It matched up pretty well to the episodes and the mood. The ending song is good not as good as the opening. Nothing to amazing that stood out with the background or original sound tract (OST) in the episodes. <br />
<br />
Character: Maiku (Mike), Miina, and Karen the three main characters. The rest are supporting characters to these three and try to help out or get in the way depending on how you look at it. Mike is a very independent, smart, and mature young man. Living on his own as a computer programmer that he learned. Mike has mixed emotions about the two girls, but is interested and caring about them. One is very likely his sister so he tries not to get to close. Miina is a feisty red head, has some past hardships that hurt her, can be out spoken from time to time. She has a caring heart, but not that great a expressing her emotions. Karen is extremely shy, and very polite. Just like Miina, Karen also has a caring heart and has a hard time expressing her emotions. The three balance each other out. It is fun to see the friendship and love they form. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I felt like I got to know, and care about the three main characters. There actions make sense and are explained very well which I liked. The silliness, misunderstanding, and emotional issues were not over the top but made for a very enjoyable story. All in all it was fun watching all the episodes. <br />
<br />
Overall: Good story telling, Good Characters, and an interesting mystery who is Mike&#039;s sister and who is not made it fun, and exciting. The anime has some flaws in the story, art, sound, and characters but not enough to really make it that bad.
