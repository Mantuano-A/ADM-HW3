    This was probably one of the most polar animes of Fall 2013; either you love it, or you thought it was boring. Enjoyment of Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (Yuusha-ni henceforth, damn..) relies entirely on the perception of Fino Bloodstone, the main character. <br />
<br />
Fino Bloodstone is an aloof, kind, and incompetent girl who has come to work at the Leon magical appliances store due to not being able to become the next Demon Lord. There, she meets Raul Chaser who is also working at Leon due to not being able to become a Hero. From that description alone, you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124809">
        already tell that &quot;I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job&quot; (the direct English translation of this anime) has a mediocre story. Even though this anime has its dark moments and attempts to tell a dramatic narrative, let&#039;s be honest; it fails at it. You can&#039;t really take an anime seriously if it&#039;s shoving breasts  and panties in your face every other scene.<br />
<br />
The fanservice in Yuusha-ni is probably the first noticeable polarizing aspect of it. Breasts. Panty shots. Suggestive scenes. Expect lots of them; Yuusha-ni has no intent on hiding its ecchi glory. There are the people who absolutely hate fanservice, claiming it to be the Demon Lord&#039;s offspring herself (see what I did there?). Then, there are the ecchi enthusiasts who watch anime solely FOR fanservice. You know which kind of anime watcher you are; delve into this anime accordingly.<br />
<br />
For all intents and purposes, Yuusha-ni should be seen as a (light) romantic comedy, with ecchi elements to it. You should watch it with that exact mindset; otherwise, you&#039;ll just come out disappointed. For what its worth, Yuusha-ni is fantastic. It had me laughing like crazy every episode. Fino is such a fun character, and this anime is just plain silly. If you love light-hearted ecchi-based comedy, Fino&#039;s personality (her cluelessness in particular), or hell, even her looks, you&#039;ll love Yuusha-ni. However, if you are neutral to fanservice, no one can tell you if you are compatible; this is just one of those anime that you have to dive in and watch the first episode to find out for yourself.

    Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita is literally the translation of “I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job.” With a title that long, it’s probably difficult to take such a show seriously. Why even bother reading the synopsis? The title is what you get and our main male protagonist in the show, Raul Chase, takes a job small shop called Magic Shop Leon. Raul himself is no ordinary young man because his origins traces him back to Hero School where he was a former Hero candidate. Like a carte in a restaurant, this show has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124789">
        a list of tasty selections to offer. And if you didn’t see it coming before, then you should have now. The show is saturated with fan service so take it reluctantly or leave it home altogether.<br />
<br />
The series can be abbreviated simply as “Yu-Sibu” and is based off the light novel of the same name written by Jun Sakyou. The initial premise sounds generic and unoriginal. After all, one cannot help but think of “The Devil is a Part-Timer” without a second thought. While both series shares similar premises, Yu-Sibu lacks what The Devil is a Part-Timer had: an engaging and energetic humorous tale between a hero and a devil.<br />
<br />
For starters, Yu-Sibu takes place in the modern setting of Japan. Despite having fantasy themes, the show ventures into a more realistic zone of portraying the working environment; or at least so it tries. The series starts off with some familiarity as we see what happens with Raul. Battered, humiliated, and defeated, he begins a new life as a salesman at a local magical store. If the show was depicted as a slice of life story, the series would have no problem with presenting Raul’s life like a biography. Unfortunately, the fantasy element enters his busy life in the form a young girl named Fino Bloodstone. Here is where it gets complicated because the girl is not just human, she’s also a demon lord’s child.<br />
<br />
If you’re coming into this series with expectations, fan service will be one of those. This is thanks to Fino and her clueless mind. Her lack of common sense not only gets herself into trouble but others as well on many various occasions. It doesn’t help by the fact that she is unconscious of situations when she wakes up nude next to Raul. Unlike most female protagonists in the typical harem series genre, Fino does not panic (much anyways) but instead question why Raul reacts in such an astonishing way. The lack of chemistry from the beginning makes this show’s characterization look like a cookie cutter without any dynamics. Luckily over time, there are some development for the duo as Fino gets more situated to her new life. However, the series still shamelessly advertises her character as the eye candy. This is supported by her clumsiness that gets herself into trouble on many occasions as well as compromising positions.<br />
<br />
No fantasy romance is complete without a rival such as Airi Ortinet, the mature older woman (Ceara August), foolish (Nova Luminous), senpai (Lore Beriferal), or the sidekick (Lamdimia Do Aximemor). The series has a package of these coming in all shapes and sizes literally. Because the series has fan service, the camera angle often focuses the girls’ movements on areas where you may raise some eyebrows in response. It never hides the fan service either as in a particular episode, the girls decide to pull out the old trick in the book by advertising themselves with swimsuits. It’s odd on most occasions that the girls in this series has little care about their sexual orientation. Only some of the more traditional characters like Airi shows emotions during embarrassing moments especially in her lascivious bunny outfit. <br />
<br />
The series does maintain its serious tone on occasions though. Most of this comes with Fino’s road of helping out at the store. Her intentions are genuine and she really wants to learn more about her job. The series captures her moments of discovery as she learns more about ideas in the human world. These include tasks such as simple greetings while working at the front counter. Not to mention the fact that Fino has the mind of a child, she often make mistakes but strives to learn from them. In one particular episode, she puts all her effort in order to impress Raul and everyone.<br />
<br />
For the story itself, it shifts between fantasy and reality on various occasions. The story picks up later on as we find out some startling revelations. The past comes back like a dagger with its sharp edge pointing at Raul. In various ways, the series doesn’t entirely neglect itself without the initial set up from the beginning. The problem is the execution being slow paced and utterly sudden.<br />
<br />
Absurd is also an underrated word to be used to describe this show. For whatever reason, Nova often lets others take advantage of her such as the dirty old man that comes to visit on occasions. Additionally, humans also sees demons as vile evil but Raul treats Fino with care. It’s peculiar the sense that Raul was defeated by a demon lord and stuck in the situation he is now. Yet, he never plots for revenge directly or take out his frustrations towards Fino. (well only when she ends up scaring away the customers) Surprisingly enough also, Raul never takes advantages of the compromising positions he gets himself into. In a way, he is more tolerable than the typical male harem although he isn’t immune to nosebleeds or lewd thoughts.<br />
<br />
In terms of comedy, the show honestly tries a bit too hard with repetitive clichés that we see often in harem series. While the series negates the presentation of a beach episode, it still keeps its fan service dosage high with sexual innuendos. The way Fino wakes up every day in the morning, the tentacle monster, bunny girl outfit, and girls in bikinis advertising themselves are just a few examples. Most of the girls’ outfits are designed with excessively short skirts where ladders are a showcase to their positions. If designs tries to hides some of the body parts, action scenes will shed them off. Speaking of action, the series does have maintain somewhat of consistency with the sword fighting, armor, and magic. Unfortunately, most of it is obscured by its strange comedy where it only occasionally shines when the plot is at its core. Wait, did I just say ‘plot’? An ecchi/fantasy series with a plot?! How remarkable. The romance itself is also blend and this is again thanks to Fino’s absentmindedness. Her trivial mind cannot even comprehend the simple term of a ‘girlfriend’. On the other hand, Raul seems to have small inklings of feelings or at least lust for Fino in the forms for daydreams. The duo may have some chemistry but their relationship is senseless and incompatible. <br />
<br />
The animation of this series is about as generic as it can get. The way the girls are designed along with their outfits is suggestive. Most of the women in this show also has absurdly big breasts that bounces in uniform. The OP song is highly innovative on this with no shame at all. Fino’s character is also designed to look like an innocent girl because of her childish behavior. However, she is more like a molded character with a million dollar body but a 2 cent brain. In other cases, the backgrounds of the series is hardly noticeable. There’s nothing extraordinary about the place our main characters work out or venture out throughout the series. Only the fantasy world occasionally has a few noticeable features to say the least. The animation studio Asread is in charge of the production with some odd similarities to their previous work, Shuffle. It’s hard to take the animation style for granted with all the fan service plastered and in the end standing out with little substance. <br />
<br />
Soundtrack wise, the series mostly retains a lighthearted nature because of Fino’s innocence. Some of the more intense action scenes does give off the feeling of how battles should feel like. But in most cases, there’s little chance for praise because the soundtrack lacks a dynamic tone. Even during some of the more emotional scenes, the soundtrack is off balance. Fino’s VA Azusa Todokoro is noticeable with her contagious laugh. (“ha, ha, ha”) It’s surprising she can portray her character so well in the case because her relative new experience in voice acting. On the other hand, Raul’s VA Keisuke Kōmoto is unfavorably dull and often possessing a commanding tone. The OP song is like a rainbow of fan service of colors. I already mentioned this before but fan service will be something you can’t avoid, at least not without diving into a wave of bouncing breasts.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to label this series as enjoyable because it’s generic plot and characters. While it does try to characterize Fino’s discovery and development on various occasions, the show doesn’t redeem itself thanks to her own lack of common sense. There’s little sense in this show either with its main plot or romance subplot. Surprisingly enough, Raul isn’t a weak man and doesn’t give into temptations like the typical harem protagonist. Unfortunately though, Raul is just the common working man with little sense of humor. The humor in this show itself also tries far too hard on various occasions fused with fan service, clichés, and gags. In the end, it’ll be up to you to enjoy this series or not. It’s not aimed for a war between humans/demons or is one about how a human and demon can find love with each other. It’s about working in the real world - a tale between a young man and a demon.<br />

    Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore we Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (this is a mouthful!), or simply, Yusibu, is a rather...interesting addition to the demon king genre of anime.  I have not seen a more ridiculously long title as this since Noucome, so I thought that I would give it a try.  Here&#039;s my review.

Story (7.43/10):  Have you ever played an RPG game before that involves you, the player, as a hero, questing and adventuring to go and defeat the dark evil of the realm?  (Games like: Final

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133061">
        Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem.)  After you finish the game, a game over appears after completing it, right?  And without a second thought, you go about your way, happy that you conquered the evil of that world.  But do you ever think about the afterthought of said world?  <br />
<br />
The story of Yusibu is what could be considered as in my eyes, as a show that continues the story of the world, after it was saved.  Because the demon lord in Yusibu has been defeated valiantly by some unnamed person, all of the heroes-in-training, including our main protagonist Raul, are reluctantly disbanded and sent away, as there is no more evil for them to fight, and therefore, no need for heroes.  It is because of that, that Raul must work at a magic shop to sell magical goods such as a &quot;hair dryer&quot; and a &quot;refrigerator&quot; in order to take care of himself.  (btw, magic = electricity in this world).  It is then on, that a new person by the name of Fino comes in, wanting a job, meeting Raul, and the story goes on from there.  <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie.  This exposition really reeled me in.  The sheer ridiculousness that this beginning exposition had, was more than proof enough that I was going to enjoy this to some extent.  And, I was gladly rewarded.  The story itself isn&#039;t really that difficult to understand.  It mainly follows the lives of Raul and Fino, as the two of them live their lives, working at the equivalent of a small department store in our world.  As such with commercial market, and animes involving businesses, the general idea of bigger competition, new products, the payday, and breaktime are all featured in the episodes, giving a very supernatural slice of life feel to the series.  The pacing is rather steady the whole way through, and didn&#039;t feel rushed or anything.  <br />
<br />
At the end though, the story threw me for a loop, as the whole series turned into your stereotypical &quot;female lead is in a situation that the male lead must save her from&quot; sort of bullcrap that exists throughout all of the anime world.  It did feel a bit different when watching it, and it was executed in an original and different way; but all in all, it was still the same thing, regardless.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t bad in any way, shape, or form, and it wasn&#039;t executed poorly either.  It was just a little bit cliched and generic with an interesting twist to it.<br />
<br />
Characters (7.43/10): The characters are an interesting mix.  Some are developed and explored to a large degree, and others are just there to appease the perverted crowd of the anime fanbase (you know who you are).  <br />
<br />
Raul Chaser.  True to his name, Raul chases his dreams, only to have them be brutally crushed before he could even start.  As the main protagonist, Raul gets a greater majority of development, as he begins the series as an ungrateful twat who can&#039;t appreciate what he has, to someone who&#039;s happy for what he&#039;s accomplish and/or done.  He&#039;s not a bad character per se, as he can kick ass when need be, as well as being an awesome guy with some common sense and little to no denseness, but he is still quite dull at times.<br />
<br />
FINO BLOODSTONE.  She needs to be in all caps because, she makes this show what it is.  Fino is the daughter of the late demon lord that inhibited the demon world.  A charismatic and enthusiastic girl who always tries her best and gets happy at the smallest of things.  She mainly occupies the role as being the show&#039;s major comic relief, as she can turn any situation or object into a depressing and sadistic one at the mention of about ten or so words.  Also, she&#039;s completely shameless, being, for the most part, ok for our main lead Raul to see her completely nude (A rare sight in anime, I find.)  Fino herself is the show&#039;s main focus, and it emphasizes that a lot, focusing the last couple episodes on her position as the demon lord&#039;s daughter, and throughout the series, building up her familiarity with the human world.  While she definitely is a bit much, the show heavily relies on her to carry the show along, which is a bit unfair considering that the side characters get jack.  (Other that Airi, who gets a minuscule amount.)<br />
<br />
The supporting cast is gigantic, consisting of about 95% of the cast.  All of them are associated with Raul in some way, either being a coworker or friend, adding into either the comedy aspect of the show, or the non-existent story aspect.  The ratio of men to women is about 2:7, so it&#039;s kind of obvious what you&#039;re in for when you&#039;re watching this show.  I&#039;ll get to that later.  Troupes include a proud loli, a tsundere with a bust complex, a kuudere, an overly happy person, the shy girl with the crush on the main lead, the coworker, and even a pervy old man.  <br />
<br />
The characters of Yusibu is a mix of well developed characters, and cardboard cutouts, creating a mix that works as well as it could&#039;ve done for this show.  I wouldn&#039;t bank on this show being the most developed show ever. <br />
<br />
Art and sound (7.02/10 and 7.00/10):  The art is good, for starters.  The palette used in this show is a more lighter tone, veering over to a whiter shade of coloring for this anime.  It is quite pleasing to the eye to look at, and the quality doesn&#039;t really dim down or anything.  The comedic scenes are also fun to look at, as they have your usual standard fare of simplified drawings for exaggerated expressions.  <br />
<br />
Now...the character designs.  There&#039;s a big, big reason that this show has been walled off by some people in the anime community  (Make that two big, big reasons.)  And that is, of course, the fanservice.  While the actual facial designs and looks of the anime are pretty well done, (except the awkward eyebrow colors that I see on the majority of the cast), the dimensions of said characters remains to be...determined.  5 out of the 7 female cast members are very big in the chest area, and as such, according to the laws of anime physics, each one of them individual breasts must move independently even due to the slightest movement of the body.  As an ecchi show, it&#039;s obvious that this should be standard fare.  But even so, they do go out of their way of glorifying it even further, and it just feels so weird to watch it.  Personally, I&#039;m fine with some ecchi, but it was just a bit over the top for me.  <br />
<br />
The sound was good, but forgettable.  The OP and ED were quite similar sounding, and sounded good, but they didn&#039;t stick in my head like other anime tracks, and they didn&#039;t seem that great to listen to.  Mood fillers are mood fillers.  No extra explanation needed.  Voice acting on the other hand was a slightly different story altogether.  Tadokoro Azusa does a fantastic job at being Fino, and I felt like it was worth mentioning because she does such a good representation of the character.  (Hope she gets more roles in the future.)<br />
<br />
Personal enjoyment (7.41/10):  Large breasts and other ecchi complaints, Yusibu was a rather interesting series to watch.  It was intriguing enough for me to start and finish all the way to the end, and gave me a somewhat satisfying feeling after finishing it.  The story was an interesting idea that was executed as well as it could&#039;ve been, and the characters were one noted, but still fun to watch.  One thing to note, is the non-existent romance.  The possible romance in the series goes absolutely nowhere, and was rather pointless to begin with since all they did was blush every now and then, and gaze into each others eyes, making you want to reach into your screen going, &quot;KISS!  KISS!&quot;  I will admit that I throughly enjoyed it regardless.  By no means is this a required anime for people to watch, but it does provide some nice, time-killing entertainment with adequate comedy, occasional female molestation, and a cliched ending that was bought from the cliche store on overused ave.  Good for killing time, not good for if you want to watch something really good and meaningful.<br />

    Yuushibu<br />
I thought this was going to be good but i found myself to be bored for the most part of the anime and i wanted to drop it but i never drop an anime, this could have been of 50 episodes and i would go through that torture just to complete it.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
At first i thought this was going to be very good because of the first minutes, where there is a fight scene but then, oh man i expected that because i read the synopsis and knew it was going to be like it was, but they didn&#039;t do it well, they failed at bringing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195154">
        a story after that but what is there was fine.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation<br />
It was very good, it was an ecchi after all, they have to make details on the bodies, the background landscape was good, smooth.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
it was forgettable, but for the most part was fine, the voice acting was ok.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This has a lot of girls but you could care less about them, they weren&#039;t interesting and the only ones that were fine were Raul and Fino and i wanted to see Airi more often but they didn&#039;t put her a lot.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
It was boring for the most part like i stated before, but the last 2 or 3 episodes are interesting and you can enjoy the ecchiness if you are aiming for that but if you want to see something like this anime but well made, then watch The Devil is a Part Timer, that one brings what Yuushibu lacks.

    HA!HA!HA! Another very pathetic anime has finished, and quite frankly, it is the supposed Fino and Rau arc that I&#039;m into it and not the whole anime, so I&#039;m ain&#039;t gonna fuck around and just present my ratings for each of this anime&#039;s category.<br />
<br />
Very good 8.<br />
<br />
Story- Frankly it&#039;s very good enough for a 10 year old and below.....now,now it is the story that I&#039;m referring to, we&#039;ll get to the fan-service later on, it is basically a typical twisted fairy tale about a group of wash-out warriors and enemies where the war between them is over and it is time to get back to basic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124875">
        living kind of thing plot,that is interest enough and wholesome enough for a children&#039;s cartoon. There isn&#039;t any of the typical sexual innuendo ( for the most part, that is) that would be around in most of animes that has an ecchi genre.<br />
<br />
Dreadful 2.<br />
<br />
Art - A lot of fanservices for the pierros to howl for, also, I kinda find it hard for the staff of Leon&#039;s magic shop to sport such attires that should be suited for someone working in a restaurant, I mean does this anime&#039;s illustrator,   Masaki Inuzumi this perverted to keep them in such attires where they look like a bunch of highschoolers working part-time in some fancy cosplay cafe? Well, if his point was to maintain that &quot;Moe&quot; thing then he could have put them in such outfits that is befitting of a typical department store clerk where the girls are wearing heels and min pencil cut skirts and not that high-school uniform thing while doing cooking class, the guys would be better off just wearing a shirt and tie.    <br />
<br />
Good 7.<br />
<br />
Sound - I pretty much like Fino&#039;s evil laugh....HA!HA!HA! Also I like Sarah&#039;s cutsy voice as well as Elsa sweet voice. I also like the opening and the closing theme as well, Raul..........his voice sounded like some dork who can do anything right.<br />
<br />
Decent 4.<br />
<br />
Character- At one point I kinda like Fino for being this good demon who wanted a simple life and has to undergo a lot of adjustment to fit it, but I kinda hate the fact that she is that naive about customer service and a bit clumsy. Raul on the other hand is a dichotomy, where at one point he still wanted to live in the past where the war between the human and demon exist and yet in another point he cares for Fino very much as a co worker, however he still plays a typical harem guy who is too dumb to be aware of his harems feelings. Sarah, I kinda like her positive thinking, but I hated her constant teasing of Raul with Fino. As for the rest of the cast, they did their part well, but not much a any flare since their roles were just too simplistic to say the least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fair 6.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- In all fairness it was enjoyable enough to a certain degree, but not that much at all, since it was pretty obvious that studio Asread focuses on the fanservice than anything else. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pathetic 1.<br />
<br />
Overall- I would never understand what&#039;s going on in the mind of the writer Jun Sakyou as why did he gave this anime such title &quot; Yūsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shūshoku o Ketsui Shimasta&quot; or I can&#039;t become a hero so I decided to get a job.&quot; Then again, this anime did live up to its title, but the problem is that to whom does this anime&#039;s title refer to, was some what of a &quot;DUH.&quot; Btw, even if the plot and story are very good, the fact is more emphasis was given on the fanservice and that&#039;s that. Adios. <br />

    This might be the first anime in which the female lead was more horrible than the male one. Usually its the other way around. There is also something with the eye drawing that was kind of unique, in a not so good way.<br />
<br />
IMO, this isn&#039;t my cup of tea series. The female lead is the blockhead in this anime. I will commend the author though, its not a HIGHSCHOOL anime, but for a store. I haven&#039;t seen anime&#039;s other than this one that are primarily based in a store. Power to them.<br />
<br />
The story is also very poor. Nothing is explained. Supposedly they were heroes in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181670">
        one age, but now they work in a hardware store? And one of the female heroes is also stalking the store? And a daughter of Demon Lord falls out of the sky. Idk, but its too much random for my taste.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there is a good amount of ecchi moments.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend it because I didn&#039;t like it BUT if you like random anime non-sense, then I think you will like this one.

    Putting it bluntly, this anime is like a strange mix of Nyarko-san Another Crawling Chaos and Hataraku Maou-sama!<br />
I took advice and gave this anime a shot. What can I say? Over-all its actually an enjoyable watch if you can handle fan service. (Spoiler Free)<br />
<br />
Story - The story was not so original because Hataraku Maou-sama! already pulled off something like this. But, with the fan service and the way the setting was set gave a new spin on it. What I really wished for most was the story to elaborate a bit more on the pasts of Raul and Fino.<br />
<br />
Art - I was a bit skeptical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125055">
        at first, but then it really grew on me. Colorful and really cool at certain points. Very bouncy and raunchy at times though! <br />
<br />
Sound - Some of the music was actually very catchy, like the violin in some of the fighting scenes. I very much enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Character - Fino reminded me of Nyarko. Very weird and very revealing. Every character had their own personality which added a bit. Not to mention finding out some of a hidden past with a few of them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - It was a fun and filling watch. If you have seen many, many, many anime... It may not be original but its definitely at the least a great time waster.<br />
<br />
Something worth watching this year if you have run out of shows!<br />
<br />

Disclaimer: This is a light-hearted series so seriously don&#039;t expect serious stuff.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to write about this anime without any spoilers but for people who enjoy comedy and can ignore the ecchi this series will be very funny. The characters were funny and the harem concept was not overdone or annoying. <br />
<br />
If you love Fino(or Phino) and Raul you ll love the show. It seemed that only 2 characters were truly given importance in this show and the rest were in supporting roles though they had hints of such potential.<br />
<br />
The idea is similar to Devil is a part timer(which is amazing) but I would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181471">
        recommend this series if you can ignore the lewdness(you wont regret it as long as you Dont think/analyze it too much)

    Oh Hello there, I bet you&#039;re wondering why the 10/10 rating. Well thats because... well... I guess you got me there.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Im not under the delusion that this show is more than a solid 7/10, but there&#039;s something about it that just makes me smile. More specifically, theres something about a man and his harem CRASHING THE ENTERPRISE ON THE SIDE OF MOUNT DOOM that just makes me smile. Yes, my fellow Trekkies, this ones for you.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, unfortunately, theres really nothing here you haven&#039;t seen before. Once again, the devil is a part-timer, and with the exception of Raul&#039;s sister and ACTUAL CAPTAIN

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219173">
        PICARD, nothing and no one really stands out. This show&#039;s selling point, aside from the glorious star trek references, is mainly a relatable premise; not everyone can be heroes, so some of us have to work the register.<br />
<br />
the animation is okay, the soundtrack is actually pretty good (even though the op and ed sucked) Its just an all-around good time in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Heres the rub:<br />
The Good<br />
-relatable premise<br />
-fino is adorable<br />
-its funny<br />
-glorious star trek cameos and references<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
-the characters and story are nothing new, you&#039;ve seen this before<br />
<br />
The Ecchi<br />
- fan service (not that I&#039;m complaining) kinda gets old, it exists more to fill a fan service quota<br />
<br />
oh, yeah, it also deserves a NSFW tag. you have been warned. that said, enjoy

    I&#039;m tempted to give it a really good, but in reality it&#039;s really only good towards the beginning and then at the end. I feel like it could have been improved if they stretched the series out more. Despite a few quirks, Fino came off as too sweet for a Demon Lord&#039;s daughter and Raul warmed up to her too quickly. I enjoyed the first 3 episodes, tolerated episodes 4-10 (a large serving of slice of life), and pretty much enjoyed 11 and 12. If you liked episode 1, you&#039;ll probably like the ending scenes. Personally, my favorite part was seeing Raul interact with his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168369">
        former Yuusha friends and then let off a mad laugh in episode 11. Fino can also be fun at times. She&#039;s naturally sweet and smiles, but when Raul tells her to smile at customers, she does and starts uncontrollably letting off an &quot;evil demon&quot; air. At those times, it&#039;s Raul&#039; s face that&#039;s the funniest. As far as ecchi goes, it&#039;s pretty mild: though there is heavy showing of bare breast and Fino being naked. Episodes 2-3 are pretty much that. If you liked The Devil Is A Part Timer, I&#039;d recommend this. Another thing is that there is almost zero lip to lip contact. That was refreshing. Hope this was helpful. In my mind, Raul was the best character. The others seemed almost typical.

    Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. or Yuushibu for short is by no stretch of the imagination a masterpiece. With that being said, it is also by no means without its merits. Yuushibu is fine; in fact, in places it’s even good. It plays to the strengths of its premise just enough to be considered fun, and that’s ok—allow me to explain why:<br />
<br />
The story of Yuushibu follows Raul Chaser: a would-be hero, if not for the fact that the Demon Lord has already been defeated. With his dreams crushed, and him in need of finding a way to make ends meet,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226129">
        Raul finds himself working for a magic shop, which is humorously setup to parody that of a modern day, Japanese electronics store.<br />
<br />
It is at this point that many people may draw a comparison with Hataraku Maou-sama! and that is certainly not unfounded; however, to suggest that Yuushibu is an imitation of Hataraku Maou-sama! is not giving credit where credit is due. Where Hataraku Maou-sama! poses the question: ‘what would happen if the Demon Lord showed up in modern day Japan?’, Yuushibu instead asks: ‘what would happen to a world where the Demon Lord no longer exists?’ They both deconstruct and poke fun at a well-established genre in opposite ways, which is truly a strength of both shows.<br />
<br />
Where Yuushibu ultimately falls short of Hataraku Maou-sama! is unfortunately in how it answers its own question. Yuushibu introduces its heroine, Fino Bloodstone, and from that point on, the majority of the show becomes the Raul and Fino show. That is not to say that this is a bad thing; their interactions are fun and make for easy watching, but it does mean that a lot of characters get sidetracked and used as mere plot devices.<br />
<br />
The show definitely picks up its momentum going into its final arc, questioning the idea of what makes a hero and what makes a villain; but once again, it’s the questions it poses that are more interesting than what actually comes across.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the show’s art is arguably where we can find another strength. Sure, with the exception of Fino and a few other characters, the character designs are mostly bland. This goes for the backgrounds too, which whilst being colourful, aren&#039;t really anything special. What makes this show&#039;s art a strength, dare I say it, is the way it handles its fan service and ecchiness. I hazard to use the word tasteful, but Yuushibu’s fan service never felt overused or too obscene. It was never the ‘plot’, if you get what I mean, so I felt it complimented the show more than it harmed it.<br />
<br />
The sound on the other hand certainly wasn’t anything to write home about. Not that it detracted from my enjoyment of the show, but it never went beyond what I expected. The same goes for the voice actors too. No one character’s voice stood out as great or annoying—they were all just fine.<br />
<br />
So to wrap things up, is Yuushibu worth watching? Yes, even if it’s just the once. At times, Yuushibu can feel like it&#039;s squandering its storytelling potential; but nevertheless, it offers up enough light romance, enough action, and enough fan service to justify the watch. Oh, and that&#039;s not even mentioning the Captain Picard cameos throughout!

    If you like boobs jiggling all over the place, harems, and no story, this was MADE for you. I figured that it would be something like &#039;Hataraku Maou-Sama!&#039;, it wasn&#039;t. It was like they took that already sub-par anime, blended it, then skimmed all of the fluffy goodness that made it it, then dumped the rest in a bucket labeled &#039;bad anime&#039;. I have got to say, I don&#039;t remember much from this anime (since I watched it quite a while back), but I don&#039;t remember crap about the main character. I feel like in order to have a good show, the main character has

        got to be at least memorable. I do remember the love interest however: she had a good design and was a well rounded character; but, those last few episodes, they just pissed me off. Why? Why the heck did they decide part-way through that it actually needed a story. The magic system already sucked, the MC sucked, the gross CG sucked: it could of at least been reserved as a stupid, but funny slice-of-life. But no, they just had to try to put a story on this thing. It&#039;s like trying to clothe Beelzebub, it&#039;s just not going to work. All in all, it deserved a 3, more like a high 2. Ugh, that espionage episode, I&#039;m going to go throw up now...

    Yuushibu is an Ecchi/Comedy anime with some minor action and romance type aspects. While the premise is similar to The Devil is a Part Timer, the focus of the shows are not.<br />
<br />
The story is simple. Raul Chaser is working at a magic items store (instead of electricity things are run by magic) but his real dream is to be a hero. However, because the demon lord was defeated there is no need for them anymore. One day a &quot;guy&quot; walks into the store and applies... this &quot;guy&quot; happens to be the demon lords kid. Okay, the &quot;guy&quot; is really a girl named Fino, the demon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190983">
        lords daughter.<br />
<br />
One thing this anime does very well is executing the premise. Each episode the characters (mostly Fino) learns something about her job or life outside the demon realm in general. At the same time... it kind of reflects like real life situations and such. It even had this whole thing about the big department store out pricing the small local shops by literally working small demons to death. I want to say that I really like the world they built in the anime. I thought using normal household appliances and having them powered by magic in this fantasy world was a great idea.<br />
<br />
Yes a big aspect of the show is fan-service and honestly in the first episode it&#039;s not that well placed. However, I don&#039;t think people should mind that much after that episode. There is a lot of fan-service but eventually it&#039;s almost completely becomes integrated into the story/situations rather than just being there for the sake of having it (okay I totally realize the situations are set up for fan service but come on)<br />
<br />
The main pair in Raul and Fino make a great team. Fino starts out very naive (and mainly stays that way) but she does learn concepts at a regular basis. Not only this but she actually has actual insight into some concepts which automatically makes her smarter than 99% of anime females. While Raul&#039;s character and the way he progresses is rather predictable but he changes gradually as Fino learns. He learns through teaching and experience and not through endless exposition.<br />
<br />
If I had a complaint is that the show is too straight forward and cliche. It does everything it sets out to do very well, has likeable characters that get development over the entirety of the series, and does not faulter on sound or animation. However, the ending is essentially saving the day because of the power of LOVE and saving a floating pair of chesticles.

    I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job<br />
<br />
 Ecchi ecchi fun.<br />
<br />
 I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero is a pretty fun show about a guy who, as the title says, who couldn&#039;t become a hero. He works in a magic item store, reluctantly of course, when a new girl appears with a resume in hand and wants to work at the same store. The new girl, named Fino, has a really interesting background, so interesting that it can change the course of the world!<br />
<br />
 The story, for the most part is a very fun slice of life about working in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198214">
        retail store when competition emerges, forcing everyone to work harder to make the store more known and popular. It&#039;s not until the last 3-4 episodes where a plot appears from quite literally no where and changes the direction of the anime.<br />
<br />
 The girls, Fino, Elsa, Airi, Nova, Saera, Lore and Lamdimia are all really insanely cute and pretty. The art style, like many harems and anime that want to accentuate cuteness, use red blemish marks on the skin, typically around the thighs, breasts, cheeks, elbows shoulders, things of that nature; it works really well and it make all the girls so much cuter! ! !<br />
<br />
 Fino, the main girl of the anime, is a totally adorable demon with a bright passion for wanting to succeed and to become something with her life; she&#039;s also has an incredibly infectious cheerful and peppy personality, making her a lot of fun to watch and care for. Raul, our main guy for I Could Become a Hero, is like most MC&#039;s in a harem based situation; he gets flustered when breasts are near him, he loses composure when a girl clings to him, but aside from that, he can be a cool guy, he&#039;d obviously be a lot better if he made some magic happen.<br />
<br />
 There are some minor characters that become a little important during the last 2-3 episodes of the anime, but I don&#039;t think I really enjoyed seeing the drastic and entirely different direction the anime went into. I guess in many ways, it makes sense and works, but I&#039;d rather not have seen Fino get manipulated and toyed with.<br />
<br />
 The music in I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero, is surprisingly good. The OP and ED are quite amazing and will probably find the artist who did the songs, but the background music was good and so were the ambient based sounds, I didn&#039;t really expect that at all.<br />
<br />
 Like I mentioned before, the art style is one that accentuates cuteness and is animated in such a way to make sure you notice the bouncing boobies and beautiful girls, a lot of good.<br />
<br />
 I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero is really a show for people looking for a lot of ecchi. We have pantsu shots, both the front and the back, we have beautiful bouncing breasts, we have nipples and amazing ass shots. The first couple episodes start off really strong on the fan service aspect too, even having a couple tentacle(hands) scenes that when explode, turn into a white mess....

    Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita (Geez what a long name) Is about a guy named Raul which was supposedly a hero. He lost his job as a hero as the demon king died, so what did Raul do? Well he found a job at a electronic shop of course, and of course the daughter of the dead demon king shows up. <br />
<br />
Story : 7<br />
There wasnt really some super plot going on, mostly comedy and some romance, you might catch a glimps of some action aswell, but just your usual romcom<br />
<br />
Art : 9<br />
The art was great! The characters looks awesome, lots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138195">
        of details were put into the characters<br />
<br />
Sound : 8<br />
Really good sounds, there was some fail moments with the sound, but usually perfect. The Intro and Outtro were really catchy and awesome<br />
<br />
Character : 9<br />
There was some character developments with Raul and Fino, but not so much with everyone else (Maybe because those are the main characters, just sayin&#039;)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 9<br />
I really enjoyed the anime, i love all kinds of romcoms and i&#039;d say that this is definitely one of those were you can sit back and enjoy<br />
<br />
Overall : 9<br />
I&#039;d definitely recommend this anime to every romcom lover, as it have everything a romcom needs<br />
<br />
Sincerely Sahel.

    You know those &quot;Power of Love/Friendship!&quot; type animes, where that sort of thing conquers the the bad guy or makes someone have a change of heart? Well, replace that Love/Friendship with &quot;We just love working here at a failing chain appliance store even though we had to give up on our dreams!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, it&#039;s the depressing thing known as Slice of Life taken to a realistic extreme, but they make the characters happy that they&#039;re in a soul crushing dead-end job.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s like this was designed to tell Otaku to get a job.<br />
<br />
<br />
My overall score for this is about a 4.5/10. <br />
<br />
The artwork isn&#039;t bad, and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147399">
        of the comedy is cute, but you wont actually laugh at any of it because nothing in this anime is original or than the main thing of &quot;The Demon Lord&#039;s daughter is working at the store with an ex-hero in training.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pro:<br />
-It&#039;s short<br />
-The combat scenes are decently well done, but there are other recent anime that are far and above this in terms of quality.<br />
-The Protagonist (Raul Chaser) isn&#039;t completely useless.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Excessive fanservice, which is probably the point of the show, and any other Slice of Life show for that matter.<br />
-The lead female (Fino Bloodstone) is almost less than 1 Dimensional, she&#039;s completely helpless, clumsy, air-headed, and just a plain stereotype.<br />
-It borders on being a harem, with at least 3-4 love interests for the MC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10:<br />
Typically, if the opening is a cutesy pop song sung by a group of girls in squeaky high voices, it&#039;s a clear sign that you&#039;re watching a bad anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10:<br />
The visuals are what you&#039;d expect from something without a huge budget that&#039;s designed to bump interest and sales in the other merchandise of the series like Figurines, Manga, Costumes, etc.<br />
<br />
Characters 5/10:<br />
Nearly every one of them is one dimensional, with seldom to overcome other than Fino getting used to the human world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 6/10:<br />
It&#039;s light hearted, and that&#039;s good if you&#039;ve just gone through an anime that has a serious moment that weighs pretty heavily on your heart, like Episode 16 of Robotics;Notes (that one still effects me).<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, in the end it wasn&#039;t anything unique, and that&#039;s how I rate a lot of anime. It didn&#039;t make me think, it wasn&#039;t awesome, it wasn&#039;t actually romantic, there was no mystery, nothing major to overcome, nothing that we didn&#039;t see coming, and barely a plot twist.<br />
<br />
All it was really focusing on was MOE and Fanservice. You can skip it and miss out on nothing.

    *Short and spoiler free*<br />
<br />
Are you a single, sexually deprived male who revels in watching cheap angles of the breasts and underwears of underaged animated girls? Then great, because this anime is perfect for you! The women are all dense, because how else would an &quot;ecchi&quot; work? Good for you though, because you already can’t handle strong women. They’re also one dimensional characters, because of course, all introspection has to be done by our beloved hero. <br />
<br />
Speaking of whom, Raul is an absolute darling and a complete gentleman (not being sarcastic). After all, he did aspire to be a hero! He was the saving grace of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241255">
        the anime. Wish we had more men like him in the real world instead of, you know, the pervs enjoying the “fan service” in this anime.<br />
<br />
Comparisons with Hatarakou Maou Sama (The Devil is a Part Timer) were to be expected, but apart from the devil and hero being forced to work together in the human world to survive, both anime have different story-lines which were treated very differently. I rated Hatarakou a LOT more, simply because it didn’t have to stoop low enough to objectify already sexualized women. It also had a plot and great characters, something which this anime lacks. Yuushi ni could have been decent, but alas, its fan servicing took whatever little good grace it had left in the eyes of viewers.<br />
<br />
Some points I have to make&gt;<br />
# Raul-Phino appeared to share a more of brother-sister relationship. The romance seemed obviously forced.<br />
# Why the FUK does a Star Wars-ish music start playing as soon as the creepy old man makes an appearance?  Randomist shit I&#039;ve seen in an anime<br />
# Why did the skins of all girls appear as if they were shrink wrapped in plastic? And those pink spots<br />
on their skin to highlight a &quot;rosy&quot; tint (shoulders, breasts and legs) always appeared as more of a rash. Ugh.<br />
# Why such a long title? I will now have to google it every time before doing any research on Google. Yes, I get the irony. <br />
<br />
<br />
PS. For those of you jerks enjoying the nipples of Phino, know that she isn’t more than 14-15 at best (argue all you want). <br />

    Is it just me, or do the Japanese love giving their anime over-the-top, overly long, ridiculous titles. I Couldn&#039;t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job is the story about a young man who went to an academy where people trained to defeat the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord was defeated before he even graduated and the academy went under. Destitute and in need of money, Raul Chaser reluctantly gets a job working for a magic appliance retail store. Months later, another person also begins working there - the Dark Lord&#039;s only daughter, Fino Bloodstone. Can&#039;t you just smell the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201514">
        recipe for disaster here?<br />
<br />
This is one of those anime that I feel is underrated. Sure, it&#039;s not the best. In fact, most of it is downright cliched. However, I think this anime understands that it&#039;s a cliche and doesn&#039;t pretend to be something else. The humor, while seen in every ecchi anime series, is well-done and over-the-top. The ecchi is, well, ecchi. There&#039;s not much that can be said there. This is an anime that has plenty of boobs for young men who want fan service to enjoy. While I&#039;m sometimes sketchy about ecchi, this anime is of the ecchi genre, so pandering to fan service actually works here - unlike some of the other anime I have watched.<br />
<br />
The animation is okay. Honestly, I&#039;ve seen better, but I&#039;ve seen worse as well. This is a middle-tier anime, where the animations aren&#039;t terrible, but not amazing to the point where you&#039;re thinking, &quot;wow! The animation is so flawless, and the frame rate is amazing!&quot; I will admit, though, that I do like the artwork. It&#039;s sort of standard, but it&#039;s still nice. The girls, in particular, are well designed. I suppose that&#039;s only natural, since this is an ecchi anime. No one&#039;s gonna want to watch an anime about boobs and nude scenes if the female&#039;s weren&#039;t hotter than sin.<br />
<br />
Despite this being an ecchi anime where most of the plot is, um, well, PLOT, this does have a somewhat interesting story. It also makes you wonder. What happens to the people who tried to become a hero but, due to unforeseen circumstances, never got the chance? This story deals with a new, intriguing aspect to heroism and Dark Lord slaying that I haven&#039;t seen before. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of defeating the Dark Lord and becoming a hero, yet now he&#039;s stuck working at a retail store because none of the vaunted, Dark Lord slaying abilities he has are useful in anything but, well, Dark Lord slaying. Now he has to deal with the fact that he&#039;s essentially wasted several years of his life learning how to become a hero in a world where heroes aren&#039;t needed. To make matters more interesting, one of his co-workers happens to be the daughter of the Dark Lord that he wanted to kill, which adds a new dynamic to the story.<br />
<br />
Aside from Raul Chaser, Fino Bloodstone, and Ahri All-A, none of the characters are really touched upon. This isn&#039;t as bad as it sounds. Like I said. This is an ecchi anime. Literally. It&#039;s genre is ecchi. In an anime where the story is merely an excuse to deliver boob scenes to the audience, character development isn&#039;t that important. I was honestly surprised that these three actually received the development they had. Raul and Ahri deal with what it means to live in a world where their skills are no longer needed, and Fino is dealing with the fact that she&#039;s a demon, the daughter of the Dark Lord, living in a world that she doesn&#039;t understand. While the plot never gets very deep or complex, sticking with mostly comedy and slapstick humor, the way these aspects are pulled off is well-done.

    Anyone who says this series is a clone of hataraku maou-sama only read the synopsis then got their fandom pitch forks out. It&#039;s a similar concept, but the way it&#039;s written is completely different.<br />
<br />
It is a ridiculous amount of ecchi, but that&#039;s ok, it&#039;s what they were going for, infact I actually started to laugh every time I saw the artists put jiggle motion emphasis on the breasts.<br />
<br />
It has a decent sense of comedy, the story is well done in my opinion (No seriously, if you think it&#039;s a copy of hataraku maou-sama commit seppuku)<br />
<br />
So generally I liked it, people will rate poorly because it

    Yusibu is a decent ecchi anime that has many fantasy elements. At its core, Yusibu relies on the formula of Beverly Hillbillies and takes a person from a faraway place with different customs and understandings and puts them in a modern setting where hilarity ensues. Make the modern setting a fantasy world where magic equals the technology you see in the real world and have the strange newcomer be the daughter of the demon lord, sprinkle in some ecchi for some added spice and you have yourself a show. That said, Yusibu is not a bad show, and I would even call it a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125741">
        show at the beginning, but it does falter at the end so I must declare it just a good show.<br />
<br />
The main characters are Raul Chaser and Fino Bloodstone. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of being a hero but that particular career field ended with the death of the demon lord, and Fino Bloodstone is the previously mentioned daughter of the demon lord that wants to live in the human world. Both these characters are employees in magical appliance store with Raul being the senior store employing showing Fino the ropes to her new job. The best part of the anime has to be the interaction between these two. Raul makes a wonderful straight man. He is established as a bad ass early on in the series who has the misfortune of working in retail. He handles himself in a much more reasonable manner than your typical ecchi male lead, though this does wear off as the series goes. Fino has an extremely energetic and optimistic attitude, but that doesn’t really help her at all when it comes to working in retail. I do like how she isn’t depicted as being stupid or clumsy, but as a fish out of water. It is nice to see her slowly get the hang of things as time goes on, but that makes it even more funnier when she makes hilarious mistakes because there still more to learn.<br />
<br />
The plot of the anime mainly revolves around the business that Raul and Fino work at, whether that is trying to learn how to interact with customers or tying to think of way to drum up business because a big competitor has moved into town. While the story is not the greatest, it allowed for comedic situations so I never found myself bored while watching it. I was disappointed how the show takes a very simplistic look at economics and the nature of running a business, but it’s really shame on me for expecting insightful discourse on the benefits and dangers of capitalism from an anime that contains a gratuitous amount of bouncing boobs in its OP. The ending was disappointing; there was really little buildup to the climax and there were multiple cases of deus ex machine. It would easily have been a great ended if the series used more foreshadowing and introduced the final antagonists sooner.<br />
<br />
There really isn’t anything in Yosibu that makes me believed it will be remembered years from now, but it is worthy for a look now and a quick laugh.
