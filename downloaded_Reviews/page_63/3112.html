        references and callbacks to the live-action series, SSSS is a lovingly crafted modernized take on the original series. The new story takes a theme relevant to today’s audiences and focuses on the youth of Japan and their relationship to technology. <br />
<br />
The show opens on Yuta Hibiki, an amnesiac first-year in high school who’s just woken up in the home of Rikka Takarada, a girl in his class. With no clue who she is, or who he is for that matter. His standard introduction no doubt had people rolling their eyes, including me, and it does detract from the story, at least until we learn why he lost his memory. Yuta sees hallucinations of a robot named Gridman in an old computer in Takarada&#039;s family store, later called ‘Junk’ in reference to its name in the original show. Afterward, he meets Sho Utsumi, his friend before getting amnesia. Sho helps him with his memory loss, which is more or less his role in the series, being Yuta&#039;s support. He&#039;s a decent character, with a minor arc and some development. Throughout the first episode, the information we’re being fed by the characters is incongruous with what we observe from Yuta’s perspective. Rikka and Utsumi easily accept Yuta’s amnesia and when he sees Kaiju looming in the distance they assume he’s joking because—like his Gridman hallucinations—he is the only one who can see them at first. In spite of the mundane reactions of people around Yuta, the directing of nearly every scene communicates dread. It constantly feels like danger is just off the frame and the next scene will change everything.<br />
<br />
Amemiya lingers on long shots too long for them to feel normal, instead, they communicate anxiety, you constantly are waiting for something to happen that will break the mundanity. Lighting is oversaturated during the daytimes to convey the crushing heat of the summer, and at night is subdued with fog and the monsters are constantly shown looming in the distance over the heroes. In the first episode, a radio playing is placed in between scenes to shift the tone. It bears so much similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion. It’s no surprise considering the director is a Gainax veteran. No doubt, SSSS.Gridman&#039;s greatest strength is the tone, it balances the mundane life of high school students with the dread of a Kaiju attack. Eventually, when the Kaiju do attack, it is equally satisfying to watch play out. The three main characters are together in Rikka’s family store when the first Kaiju begins wreaking havoc on the city, forcing Yuta to work with Gridman fight off the monsters in giant robot form. Together they create the Gridman Alliance, dedicated to defeating any Kaiju that threatens to destroy their city.<br />
<br />
Animation is fluid, characters are incredibly expressive, storyboards are filled with detail, shots are excellently framed. The camera work is dynamic making the action always exciting and even the CGI used during many of the fight scenes is superb. The sound design is especially amazing at giving audio feedback during these scenes, a vehicle being crushed, the ground crumbling under a monster, and all of the attacks sound so visceral and lifelike. From time to time the show&#039;s incredible opening is used as background music in fights, and this would typically grow tiresome but because the song is so good and relevant to the story it never bothered me. At times the monster&#039;s movements look janky, but it never feels unintentional, watching old tokusatsu series shows that this is how the monster/giant robot fights looked, they move in ways that make it seem as though someone is inside a suit navigating them. 2D animation could never have achieved the authenticity of the monsters they were aiming for here. Not every scene is exploding with action, but even when the pace slows down, the directing and intruiging storyboarding are still visually arresting. One qualm I would bring up is the overabundance of fanservice placed at awkward moments, this thankfully only happened in certain episodes around the midpoint of the show. All around, this show is incredibly faithful to the original series, visually, audibly, and narratively.<br />
<br />
The story is at times too standard to the genre and could have used more originality rather than reliance on the source material. It delivers it&#039;s story beats confidently and plenty self-aware of the nostalgia it&#039;s evoking, but the times it updates the script to a modern audience are worthwhile. Important information is shown to us rather than told, a characters motivation is never told to us before it is shown, a twist never comes that wasn’t foreshadowed heavily. This showing rather than telling comes across the most in Akane Shinjou&#039;s scenes, a classmate of Yuta’s. She offers the most exciting writing in the show. In the first episode alone, her scenes convey more fear than any of the Kaiju scenes. She’s subtle with her dark side and when she gets her quiet moments of angry reflection you get to see how bitter she is. Her psychotic tendencies and lack of care for others are made all the more frightening by how much power she proves to have.<br />
<br />
Although Yuta&#039;s simplistic personality is explained very well in the narrative, Rikka and Akane get far more development than him. Eventually, they even take his place as the protagonists, and the show is much better for it. Rikka gets more development than Yuta and becomes a remarkably sympathetic character right away. While Yuta and Utsumi celebrate their victories against Kaiju she worries about the fallout of the city being attacked and if her friends are safe. She&#039;s the most nuanced character in the show, and it often feels like she is a normal person who was placed into the plot of a wild sci-fi kids show. Her apprehension towards conflict and her contemplation of the effects of what&#039;s occurring in the story are what makes her so believable. Yuta and Utsumi are at first, ecstatic to escape the mundane life of being a student, then the shock of the danger they’re in forces them to face reality and change their mindsets. Whereas Yuta accepts he has to overcome challenges at face value and follows through like a typical protagonist, Rikka is constantly questioning why she’s in such a dire situation and where her place is in all of it. Her development throughout the show is intertwined with Akane&#039;s and they both change in ways that are very engaging to watch play out. <br />
<br />
The themes of Gridman are showcased throughout the story in the elaborate technology the villain has, all alone in her room, contrasted with the beat-up old computer the Gridman Alliance use. Yet even with basic technology, they prove to be formidable foes to the Kaiju, and they enjoy working together. What the screenwriter is trying to say is rather basic, but it’s nonetheless a well-reinforced theme and consistent throughout the show, you don’t need an abundance of technology to have good relationships and valued friendships. <br />
<br />
[Final Score: 8/10]<br />
SSSS.Gridman stands as one of the best mecha in recent memory. Stylistically it is much different than the rest of Studio Trigger&#039;s anime, but it is one of their greatest works yet. It wears its love for the original series and tokusatsu entertainment on its sleeve. The story is wonderfully nostalgic, and surprisingly enough, thought-provoking. Laden with subtle details building up to every twist, every theme, it is both visually interesting and endlessly analyzable. I look forward to rewatching it time and time again in the future.

Hey, are you feeling down because you have this great idea for an anime but keep getting rejected by every studio that you try to sell your pitch to? Well it&#039;s time to turn that frown upside down, because Studio Trigger will gladly produce your anime for you, as long as your anime contains a few specific things of course. Here are the three easy steps that you must follow in order to have your anime green lit by Studio Trigger!<br />
<br />
1. Make sure to have a LOT of steamy hot fan service. It&#039;s best if your main source of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296513">
        sex appeal comes from your leading female character, because being hot waifu material &gt; having a personality and depth.<br />
<br />
2. Have your main character (who has to be an edgy teen btw) fly around in a giant mecha all the time because BIG ROBOTS ARE AWESOME!!!<br />
<br />
3. ADD ALIENS! Especially as twist villains for the final arc of your story, because there&#039;s nothing better than kids in giant robots fighting against aliens in FREAKING SPACE!!!<br />
<br />
Follow these simple steps and your anime will be practically guaranteed to end up as Trigger&#039;s next unsuccessful imitation of great anime like NGE and TTGL just like SSSS.Gridman is!<br />
<br />
...On second thought, maybe you should just try your luck with a no-name studio.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m starting to think that creativity died at Studio Trigger. Yet although they seem to consistently recycle the same exact ideas, I&#039;ve still enjoyed their works. I loved Kill la Kill because it somewhat deviated from the traditional Trigger formula and was just a great and fun anime all around. I even really liked Darling in the FranXX up until they butchered the ending because Trigger just HAD to have aliens. But with StopSoundingSoStupid.Gridman (Seriously, are the four S&#039;s supposed to mean something?), it just felt hollow. I never got the impression that this anime was trying to stand out and make a name for itself, and it unfortunately ended up being painfully average because of it.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, my score for this anime fluctuated several times throughout its run time. I actually did find some episodes to be enjoyable and even thought provoking, yet others were the embodiment of mediocrity equipped with bad character interactions and bland scenarios. The only things that remained consistent throughout were Rikka&#039;s sexy legs. But even those thick thighs weren&#039;t enough to salvage the dysfunctional plotline of this anime. <br />
<br />
The setting is quite bizarre. Our protagonist has come down with a rather unfortunate case of amnesia that is poorly explained near the end of the anime and finds himself in a city surrounded by a bunch of giant kaiju that only he can see. But he doesn&#039;t really seem too concerned about any of this. In fact, he doesn&#039;t seem to care about anything at all except for getting in Rikka&#039;s pants. And when other characters finally realize that our hero Yuuta isn&#039;t insane and see the kaiju too, they also don&#039;t seem to care too much about their situation. And that&#039;s one of the glaring issues with this anime. If the characters are completely nonchalant about basically everything, then why should we the viewers care about what&#039;s going on? Not that the story itself is anything exciting. It&#039;s just a typical monster of the week that Gridman and Yuuta beat up and then everything resets (the damage to the city and the memories of everyone who isn&#039;t an important character) because plot. And despite what you may be thinking, there really isn&#039;t much more to this anime than that. If anything, it just became even more confusing and convoluted by the end of the show.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the characters are pretty stale. Gridman is the most bland sentient robot ever conceived and is piloted by the most uninspired kid imaginable. Utsumi is that typical friend guy who never does anything useful except crack a joke or two every ten minutes. Rikka is the attractive female lead who&#039;s personality unfortunately isn&#039;t as good as her looks. Alexis is some random alien that&#039;s randomly in this anime because Trigger has an alien fetish. The other characters bar one aren&#039;t even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
*This short segment contains spoilers as well as positive thoughts on this anime*<br />
<br />
The one person who keeps this anime from falling into garbage territory in my eyes would be Akane. She takes the role of the antagonist, making all of the kaiju herself and trying to kill Gridman and people she doesn&#039;t like with them, and the anime literally revolves around her since she is, you know, a god. She seems like a fun and energetic girl at first, but after peeling away her mask, her true colors as a heartless, attention seeking psycho are exposed. And the anime even further sheds light on her intricate and delicate psyche later on in the show. The dream sequence episode, while weird, was one of my favorites from the anime simply because of how it portrayed Akane. She&#039;s just a really engaging character who I enjoyed watching. She&#039;s also pretty hot, I&#039;d say even more so than Rikka&#039;s (Yeah, I said it!) Akane is definitely the highlight of SSSS.Gridman for me.<br />
<br />
*End of spoilers and positivity*<br />
<br />
Despite my obvious displeasure with a decent chunk of this anime, it was still semi enjoyable to watch. Sure, the anime doesn&#039;t have much heart, but watching a giant robot beat up giant monsters is always fun, despite how repetitive it gets. And Rikka and Akane were a pleasure to watch (for more reasons than one~), so that&#039;s always a plus.<br />
<br />
Show&#039;sStorySeriouslySucks.Gridman is underwhelming. It never really went anywhere and just felt sort of pointless. A lot of things didn&#039;t make sense and when the anime did try to explain something, it usually just made it even more confusing. Let&#039;s hope that Studio Trigger is able to improve with their next project.<br />
<br />
And hopefully not include any aliens.

    When SSSS.Gridman first began, people really didn’t like it. I think a lot of the surface-level elements turned people away, especially since the first few episodes were fairly slow and predictable. But once the show actually got going, the actual content there kept us coming back week after week, and it ended up being not just one of my favorite shows of its season, but of the year as a whole.<br />
<br />
	Gridman is a precarious mix of genres, balancing seemingly everyday school life against giant mecha fights. The former goes against what people expect from mecha anime, and is likely responsible for the show being labeled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296502">
        as slow. However, these two disparate halves somehow built off each other, with the tension of the daily life feeding into the catharsis of the action scenes. Since it&#039;s the more mundane material that seems to have garnered the most criticism, that&#039;ll be the focus of this review.<br />
<br />
	Interestingly enough, this means I really don’t need to talk about Yuta. While he may pilot Gridman, his amnesiac protagonist bit gets in the way of him having a particularly interesting school life, and instead Rikka steps forward as the protagonist. Rikka is the more emotionally-driven of the two, and while she’s aware of all the kaiju shenanigans going on in the show, it’s never really her main drive.<br />
<br />
	Instead, Rikka’s conflict is her trying to reconnect with Akane, the antagonist of the series with whom she used to be close friends. Akane creates the kaiju that terrorize the city, and it would be so easy to just view her as the villain, especially since this is how she presents herself. But unlike the other protagonists, Rikka doesn&#039;t look at her through this lens. By refusing to play on Akane’s terms of mecha and kaiju, she is the one who is able to genuinely reach out to Akane and save her from her isolation. This story of reconnection could have been treated as secondary to the main action, but instead it’s given the same level of attention, receiving much of the show’s expressive animation and relatable character moments.<br />
<br />
	Also, the show absolutely nails atmosphere. Though everything seems mostly normal for the first half of the run, the show&#039;s use of its claustrophobic camera and tendency for long pauses serve to constantly instill a sense of discomfort in the viewer as they try to figure out why the world seems off. The summer heat is tangible and oppressive, and the rainy days are all the more miserable. The soundtrack goes a long way to sell these scenes, and the opening and ending are both fantastic.<br />
<br />
	Briefly, I’ll talk about how the show handles homage. I think a lot of the criticism leveled at the show is based on it being too steeped in references to other shows, to the point that animator for the original Gridman Obari Masami complained that they weren’t doing anything new with the material. With that said, I don’t mind having these callbacks as fanservice to fans of the original, especially since they don’t conflict with the story being told. Plus, how upset can I really be over all of the character designs being based on obscure Transformers? That’s adorable.<br />
<br />
	In conclusion, Gridman is just really good, you know? If you’ve been on the fence about watching Gridman because of the initial negative reception, I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth trying for yourself. I&#039;m still not entirely clear why so much of the community is down on this show, but I absolutely loved it, and I hope that more people will give it a chance.

    This show is so under-rated. I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s rating is so low on MyAnimeList. Big shotout to PhenomSage for recommending.<br />
<br />
It proves that you really can&#039;t judge a book by its cover, or review on MAL.<br />
<br />
So to start off, a lot of you will probably look at this anime and think: &quot;Ew, its UltraMan animated&quot;. This is for kids... Next. <br />
<br />
But not so fast, while this anime does borrow a lot of inspiration from UltraMan, it is in a differnt league. The story is very fresh and creative, with it&#039;s own spin on the UltraMan genre that is obviously intented for a more mature

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292898">
        audience. The closest anime I can think of is Madoka Magica and its adoptation of the SaliorMoon genre. <br />
<br />
The story started off awesomely and is getting more and more interesting every episode. You just need to watch it without any prejudice. Yes, it&#039;s about a boy who transforms into an UltraMan-like hero and fights monsters, but this is only a cover-up for a deeper underlying story. There&#039;s is clearly some dark mystery going on in the background, but the story doesn&#039;t draw more attention to it than it needs to. <br />
<br />
I need to applaud the storytelling so far, it&#039;s so on-point with its humour, pace, and suspense. The characters are also very interesting and beautifully created. They are super relatable and realistic. They are never oblivious to their situation and stalls out the story. Instead, they are the key driving force of the plot. The whole &quot;battling monsters&quot; acts as more of a background entertainment, which can be pretty nostalgic for those of us growing up watching UltraMan. The art is amazing! Top-tier along side animes like Code Geass and Macross Frontier. Music is awesome too! You can tell the creators are putting a lot of thought and efforts into this. <br />
<br />
But seriously, you&#039;ve got to watch it to believe it. I don&#039;t want to spoil anything. And trust me, you won&#039;t regret it.

    SSSesth Gridman is the newest name monster from the studio everyone knows and which creativity after Inferno Cop has been entirely limited to their ability to make up shitty names that don&#039;t mean anything. eSeSeSeS. Gridman&#039;s biggest achievement is confirming that the future won&#039;t be changing this to any direction, especially not for better.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Dude who has red hair starts hearing his computer talking to him and claiming he is this thing called Gridman while girl who he has never seen before in his life is now living with him or something. Then they start arguing over if the pc really talked. Less than half way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292718">
        into episode 1 and I was already confident that this is going to be a veeery long show despite its 1-cour length. <br />
<br />
Rest of the writing centers around student life, chats about sandwiches, monster of the week epicness, reveals regarding the daily life of our cast, some mystery elements that are mysterious because they don&#039;t make any sense, mecha fights and new things that matter even less than the events before them. Also aliens with swords and yu-gi-oh arm bands, because more &gt; less, apparently. <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
Did I mention the dude has red hair? Well, that&#039;s not exactly important, but I just can&#039;t figure out what else there supposed to be to him. He also suffers from a memory loss which is the single worst trope invented by man, which is great because that&#039;s exactly the type of lame shit this show deserves.<br />
<br />
Rikka is the best girl because she sighs every 3 seconds and sounds both disinterested and bored, which is also great because I imagine she has become self-aware and has realized she is a character in this fucking thing. *sigh* &quot;this out of all anime&quot; <br />
<br />
There are also other characters here. One of them stares at the sky and it looks like she is finding it very fascinating, she is also insane or mentally ill / both. Another has glasses so that&#039;s kinda cool, always need that one motherfucker who can&#039;t see shit. I would love to mock all of these characters for more meaningful and less shallow reasons, but they are shells whose presence is entirely limited to their character models. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Gliddoman&#039;s animation consists of completely still background images, extremely slow tempo walking scenes and character interaction / dialog moments where the character animation is like 2 frames-per-second and there is no in-between animation at all: what we see is teleportation without any continuity. I have personally never seen anything like this in my life, but I am sure they managed to execute the whole thing with 70% less animators than is normally required, so if we are looking into pros: very few people have been required to waste their time working with this awful piece of anime. Kudos.<br />
<br />
The monster design is great. The first thing that appears is basically oversized, pink colored Donatello who has a dragon head in the place of a navel. Which is amazing since its shell is so full of spikes it well get stuck on any surface it lays on its back and if it falls on its stomach, its neck will break. This is pretty much why I am finding this show to be worth of watching, I have had a blast imaging this fking thing yelling &quot;I am invincible!&quot; then tripping over and never moving again. Its movements are even better. Waddles from side to side and occasionally looks like a passable, decent quality slide show....<br />
<br />
Sounds:<br />
<br />
Why would anyone even want music amirite. It&#039;s so much more pleasant to listen teenagers acting like they are surprised. I can&#039;t figure out if this is really supposed to be voice acting or a parody of the seiyuu industry. Dude sees a Gozilla in the sky and gets almost as excited about it as a house wife who is ironing her husband&#039;s socks. &quot;Oh wow, this shit&#039;s great.&quot; Except that&#039;s the first time he ever sees one. Or maybe not because he suffers from memory loss. On the other hand, I care way too little to consider more possibilities. <br />
<br />
Also I kinda lied. There are songs, but they mainly exist in action scenes and don&#039;t work very well. First one lasted like 15 seconds and was terrible trailer-music-tier stuff but lacking anything that makes them good. The second lasted approximately 4 seconds and I am still uncertain if it was really a song or the sound of a siren just before its battery runs dry. The third song was an anime opening you hear typically in seasonal slice of life shows except here it was inserted in the middle of an action sequence and its vocals were more visible than the action itself. I am not sure why anyone would want to make something like this or think this is a good idea, but whatever, since everything else is already terrible, why not make the sounds awful, too, I guess.  <br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
SSS Gridman Sucks. The last S. is really supposed to be moved at the end of the sentence, hence the dot in title. Thanks Triggarh

    SSSS.Gridman is an anime inspired by the old tokusatsu series Denkou Choujin Gridman. It takes what&#039;s interesting about the genre and adjusts it to fit the modern day&#039;s standards. Thanks to that the final product turned out to be an interesting mix of old and new. Add to it the outstandingly good execution and you get a masterpiece that can keep you glued to the screen with every episode.<br />
<br />
The main character of the anime is Yuuta Hibiki - a high school boy that wakes up at Rikka Takarada&#039;s home having no memories at all. At the Junk Shop, which belongs to Rikka&#039;s family, there&#039;s an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296525">
        old computer called Junk. And inside of it there&#039;s Gridman - the Hyper Agent telling Yuuta there&#039;s a mission he needs to fulfill. Yuuta lets his school friend Utsumi in on what&#039;s happened and when huge monsters called kaijuu start attacking the city, these three form the Gridman Alliance and with the help of the robot inside Junk, they start fighting said monsters and begin the journey to discover the truth about the city and everyone in it.<br />
<br />
Since the very beginning there&#039;s a feeling that there&#039;s more to the show than it might appear at first. In what could be labelled as a naive show targetting the younger audience there&#039;s always the feeling that something is off and with every episode the eerie atmosphere becomes more apparent, which only makes the experience better. I loved the mysterious atmosphere of the weird, closed off city and the scenery filled with giant dormant monsters reminding you that even the calm days aren&#039;t how they should be.<br />
<br />
What adds to the atmosphere is the background music, or rather the frequent lack thereof. Because of that (and of the animation) some scenes look pretty slow, but I wouldn&#039;t call it a bad thing in this particular case. The music does always appear during the fight scenes, though, and it&#039;s fitting and good. I also liked both the opening and ending song. There&#039;s a song I liked even more, though, and namely Yume no Hero - the original Gridman&#039;s opening song - which the original version of we can hear in the last episode and there was also a rearrangement of it played before. <br />
<br />
As for the fights, what&#039;s much more outstanding about them than the soundtrack are the visuals. The fight scenes are super good and in my opinion they only get better with every episode. The CGI used during them looks clean and good quality and it also makes Gridman and the kaijuu look kind of heavy like they are supposed to be. We also get to see lots of cool transformations and gattai. Many cool combinations appeared throughout the show. <br />
<br />
The visuals are great not only during the fight scenes. There are rather many still frames, but I perceive them as an artistic move, which I like. But when things are moving, the animation is fluid, especially when there&#039;s a lot of action going on. The backgrounds are full of details, the characters have nice designs (I also love their eyes) and there is nothing about the visual side of the show that I could complain about.<br />
<br />
I found the characters to be another really strong point of the anime. Our main trio is totally likeable. Although devoid of some super unique traits, they feel genuine and their actions are understandable. And that&#039;s exactly what I like about them. They are just a group of normal high school kids whose everyday life changes because of the strange events happening. One could complain about the main character being bland, but there&#039;s a reason behind that, and it&#039;s more than just the fact that he has no memories. There&#039;s also Akane Shinjou - the girl everyone loves and a friend of Rikka. The Neon Genesis Junior High Students are a crazy but lovable and useful bunch, whose eccentricity doesn&#039;t fail to make the viewers smile. There&#039;s also a certain kaijuu boy that grew on me over time. The supporting characters are also fine. <br />
<br />
As for the references - there seem to be many of them, but as someone that has never been into tokusatsu shows, I can&#039;t say much about them, unfortunately. I feel like I&#039;m missing out a bit, but it&#039;s not like being knowledgeable about this kind of thing is necessary to enjoy the show. I&#039;m sure the references will add to the experience for people that are more familiar with that stuff, though. I also wanted to mention one thing I looked up before, and namely the background of a certain girl that played an important role in the episode 6. If you are interested in that, I recommend looking up a kaijuu named Anosillus. It&#039;s quite moving. Episode 6 is also the one the aforementioned rearrangement of the old opening song was played in.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, I see SSSS.Gridman as a show made of love and care for details. In spite of it taking inspirations from other things, it feels like it has its own identity. The quality of the anime is super good. To me this show is one of a kind. Simple, yet interesting and satisfying. I found it to be extremely enjoyable and I highly recommend giving it a try!

    Simply too simple and bland.<br />
<br />
SSSS.Gridman is really another Mechca anime genre that fails to deliver any good plot or even likeable characters at all. Now, I&#039;m not saying all Mechca anime is bad because that&#039;s true. There are some good one out there... but there is more bad than good. SSSS.Gridman has such a simple plot. Kaiju comes, transform into Gridman, and done. Rinse and repeat pretty much. They might add a bit more &quot;drama&quot; to the mix but the formula wouldn&#039;t change since it&#039;s so simple. I&#039;m not saying &quot;simple&quot; is also bad, anime such anime &quot;Yuru Camp&quot; is so simple but so satisfying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293140">
        to watch because the characters make up for it. I see a lot of people be like Rikka is different or something about her is special. What in the hell are you even looking at? She&#039;s literally those typical character where she value friends and whatnot and will do her best to save those relationship ties that she has with them. And trust me, Yuuta isn&#039;t any better. This anime is literally a cover of a book with no story inside of the book itself.<br />
<br />
Subject to change but I don&#039;t think it will.

<br />
Director [claps hands]: Okay. Thank you all for coming on such short notice. I just wanted to discuss some further details on the series that I thought appropriate.<br />

Director [smiling]: Great! Okay. Masaru [Sakamoto], you are in charge of the character designs, right?<br />

Masaru [nodding]: Yes, that is correct.<br />

Director: Okay. May I see how they look so far?<br />
<br />

<br />
Director: Okay. I like what you have here, but I think we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296501">
        can make both of these female characters stand out more.<br />
<br />
Masaru [intrigued]: Sure. What would you want to change about them?<br />

Director [pointing at Rikka]: Okay. [leans towards Masaru’s ear and whispers in a serious tone] I want dat ass big and her thighs thicc!<br />

Masaru [choking in absolute shock]: Uhh sir, I mean… are you sure about that?<br />
<br />
Director [grabs Masaru by the collar]: Okay listen here bucko, I’ve been in this industry for over a decade. I was an animator for one of the most successful anime from this year, Darling in the FranXX, so I think I know a thing or two about what sells in this business. [Releases his grip on Masaru and returns to a light-hearted tone] And try and make the other girl look cute, but not with thicc thighs. Only one girl gets that.<br />
<br />
Masaru [still stunned after what had just transpired]: Wh-what do you mean, “look cute”?<br />
<br />
Director [walking away]: Just think what I would look like if I were a high school girl. Okay?<br />

Regardless of how seriously you take the frankly awful transcript written above, it’s hard to argue just how much attention to detail went into the creation of SSSS.Gridman. While being heavily inspired by the 1993 live-action series Gridman the Hyper Agent, this version is loaded with visual references to numerous tokusetsu series and mecha anime of the past – Space Runaway Ideon, Getter Robo, Evangelion, several iterations of Gundam and more receive stunning rendition scenes that serve as quick but effective throwbacks appealing to nostalgia for the die-hard fans of yesterday. Whilst on the other side of the community, Gridman had managed to conquer the ever-present “best girl” debate of the season, with each week providing more material and support for why each girl and this series is worth one’s attention. Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist’s child the entire time (there’s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.<br />
<br />
SSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time – focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There’s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.<br />
<br />
The story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people’s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it’s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.<br />
<br />
Gridman’s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.<br />
<br />
As far as Gridman&#039;s production value is concerned, this is where the series really shows off its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman’s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.<br />

Whenever a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation – all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn’t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines.<br />

    SSSS.hit!<br />
<br />
Is Studio Trigger aware that they are not required to produce wack-ass anime ad infinitum?  It feels like they take pleasure in discovering new ways to SSSS.hit all over your computer screens, just to see how desperate we are for a new Mecha anime.  Perhaps the success of Inferno Cop went to their heads, giving them a false sense of entitlement to shove even worse rubbish up our collective SSSS.hit(holes), in hopes that we would gobble it up like a bunch of mindless, horny drones.  I can’t blame a player for wanting to get paid, but I can certainly blame Studio Trigger

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296499">
        for wanting to get paid………<br />
<br />
…What?  Why are you staring at your screen like that?  Nothing to see here.<br />
<br />
SSSS.Gridman is an anime that utilizes a formulaic approach to present a vapid adventure about a young boy who merges with a Mecha to fight outlandish “monsters” in a no holds barred, explosive battle to the death.  The fights, themselves, are  standard-fare.  Emulating the exaggerated absurdity of Gurren Lagann, but never quite reaching the eccentricity of Kill la Kill.  But while the former two attempted to stitch together (see what I did there? **Kill la Kill reference**) an acceptable narrative with their own, unique brand of action-comedy, SSSS.Gridman fails to capture the viewer’s attention in any meaningful fashion.  Per the cyclical, episodic framework, each 23 minute offering utilizes a “rinse and repeat” approach, where a new “monster”/Kaiju enters the city only to be defeated by the Gridman and reset everyone’s memories (except for those directly involved), as if the crisis never happened.<br />
<br />
By virtue of being repetitious, Studio Trigger, once again, displayed a general lack of ambition and creativity, especially with the addition of a superfluous river rafting episode, to give the staff an excuse to animate the girls in scantily clad outfits.  Furthermore, SSSS.Gridman is not funny.  The entertainment is lackluster, at best.  The concepts and themes are tedious.  And dare I mention the plot?…It’s not like the staff cared to mention it in any detail.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the worst aspect of the show is the prosaic, uninspired characters.  None of  them say/do anything worth remembering, nor do they come off as likable or worth caring about.  Yuta is your typical “only I can save the day” protagonist, with a plain, “nice guy” demeanor and a distinct red hair color.  His rival, Akane Shinjou, is a cold, despondent female with a murderous rage that can only be quelled by generating new Kaiju to terrorize the city and anyone who has wronged her.  Why, you may ask: because she’s a psychotic bitch (need I elaborate?).  Akane’s manipulator, Alexis Kerib, is the show’s token evil “alien,” to guide events to their ultimate conclusion. Studio Trigger, much to my dismay, seems to excel at producing low quality characters that exude pure nothingness, except for some hackneyed quarks and superficial characteristics.<br />
<br />
The only positive aspect about SSSS.Gridman is the OST, not that it was anything spectacular, but it accomplished its goal of being mildly entertaining.  But if we consider that an OP/ED are merely shallow, trivial components of what a show truly entails, then it’s quite the condemnation to the substantive portions of the show in question.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn’t you agree?…

    SSSS.Gridman is a truly bizarre experience. After the monumentally disappointing Darling in the FranXX and the surprisingly worthwhile Planet With, this show completes the year’s holy trinity of super robot anime by being a confusing mixed bag that is a nightmare to discuss. While it doesn’t exactly go full Evangelion, there are still references to it as well as stylistic similarities between the two. However, there’s more to this peculiar anime than just being another run-of-the-mill mecha series.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, this is both a tokusatsu and super robot anime. Sparing you the lengthy history of both concepts, it’s clear that the trappings of the two

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296515">
        genres aren’t easy to deal with in contemporary anime—or any anime in the case of tokusatsu. Case in point: while reused animation is common in mecha series, they’re mainly utilized for robot transformations and special attacks. However, SSSS.Gridman goes as far as to rewind even non-action scenes, creating unnecessary repetition. Studio Trigger also decided to render the Gridman and its Kaiju foes using CGI, and the jarring blend between these 3D models and their 2D environment causes a serious case of the uncanny valley. Not helping matters is how these hulking titans continually swap between 2D and 3D, making everything they interact with --i.e. the road, the cars, the debris, etc.-- become a visual disaster. It’s a shame these graphical problems make the fights harder to follow given their cool choreography and sakuga moments.<br />
<br />
The art style of this series is far from appealing. Aesthetically, the show is incredibly bland. The inconsistent animation can sometimes make the faces look like deformed potatoes, which are further accentuated by the uninspired character designs. The characters look incredibly plain apart from their vibrant eyes, and even the more appealing individuals such as Anti and Rikka seem lacking. Another problem is the awkward movements, specifically the hand and arm motions. Long story short, this show has a bunch of visual oddities that dampen the experience.<br />
<br />
In spite of all the aforementioned problems, SSSS.Gridman has a striking direction. There are moments between fights that highlight a sense of discomfort and eerie quietness, similar to the atmospheric pauses in Evangelion. These scenes feel pretentious at times, but the clever framing of shots that illustrate the emotional distance of the characters makes them more engrossing than not. Film buffs might find this directing standard fare, but such a thing is noteworthy in the anime landscape. The dream sequences in episode nine are particularly fun to witness and showcase the creative talent of director Akira Amemiya.<br />
<br />
S^4 Gridman heavily restrains its usage of background music. Most non-action scenes lack an accompanying soundtrack. You would think the absence of music makes their purpose more meaningful, but sadly this isn’t the case. Since the soundtracks aren’t utilized frequently, none of them are memorable as a result. However, there is one track that stood out: the opening theme “Union” by OxT. As an uplifting song, it works as a call to action that plays when the main cast is gaining the upper hand against their Kaiju opponents. The song doesn’t always mesh properly with the sequence since it’s sometimes too quiet, but when it does, be prepared for some epic moments. Sadly, all this can’t be said for the forgettable ending theme.<br />
<br />
The cast of SSSS.Gridman is a mixed bag. For every character like Calibur, whose quirkiness comes from his silent, dorky attitude, we have someone boring like Yuta, our unremarkable protagonist. Most of the main characters, including the titular Gridman, are one-dimensional; the most interesting thing about them is their genuine interactions amongst each other. On the other hand, the three antagonists are highly fascinating. Akane is similar to a child trapped in her own sandbox video game world, twisted by her own influence, loneliness, and creations. One of these creations, Anti, is a foil to Gridman. He’s an overly serious edgelord so hell-bent on destroying Gridman that he ends up being hilariously awkward in social interactions. He would even pick fights with other Kaiju simply because of his desire to personally kill Gridman. As for Alexis, his voice and demeanor make him seem incredibly humorous and lackadaisical -- even as he shoves a buzzsaw to someone’s eye.<br />
<br />
One irksome trait the cast share is their tendency to restrict themselves for no proper reason. For example, in episode three, Yuta, Calibur, and Gridman worry the others by disappearing after a Kaiju defeats them, only for them to be on standby the entire time. One could make the argument that rushing back into battle or retreating immediately would have tipped the Kaiju off, but they could have escaped after it left since they can just warp back to the shop. <br />
<br />
All this segues perfectly into SSSS.Gridman’s obscure narrative. The mystery surrounding the show’s existentially horrifying world is unnerving in the sense that the narrative gradually becomes more destructive as secrets begin to unravel, a la FranXX. While I don’t feel the show crosses that line enough to destroy any investment I could possibly have --at least until episode 10-- there’s a fundamental aspect of the world-building that doesn’t strike me the right way. <br />
<br />
Tiptoeing around spoilers, one of the major gimmicks of this show&#039;s world is that everyone’s memories of the dead are altered when a character dies at the hands of a Kaiju, or a Kaiju gets destroyed. With the exception of the surviving combatants, everyone’s mind starts to become hazy. It’s not quite on the level of Re:Zero where society begins to doubt the existence of certain individuals, but it’s still a frustrating gimmick that doesn’t entirely make sense. As such, the show’s convoluted narrative makes it difficult to recommend. The asspulls in the second half only adds to this problem.<br />
<br />
Despite its various shortcomings, SSSS.Gridman is still an entertaining mecha anime. The fights are fun to watch, the banters between the characters are engaging, and the twisted hellhole of a world leaves viewers with much to ponder. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I’m familiar with the tokusatsu genre, but I doubt such knowledge would make this show any less difficult to unpack. It’s an enigmatic mixed bag that I am glad to have watched.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and on top of the Eva references, this show makes a Gurren Lagann reference, so there’s another link between the Gridman Planet With FranXX trio.<br />

    I went into SSSS Gridman with high expectations because outside of me being big fan Gainax/Trigger I wanted to see if Trigger its wounds after they got drill blasted by Darling in the Franxx by A1/Cloverworks that left a nasty wound which needed a lot of time to recover from. I actually thought the series would go back it&#039;s Little Witch Academia/Kill la Kill days where it a nice blend of style and substance. However, after watching all 12 episodes of this show subbed and the first 8 episodes dubbed I can definitely say that this is not Trigger as it&#039;s best. In fact, this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296552">
        is one of Trigger&#039;s weaker shows.<br />
<br />
The word dull is honestly the best word to describe the story of SSSS Girdman. While it wasn&#039;t actually awful by any means it just so dull and at times uninteresting to follow. The series basically follows your classic monster of the week formula where set kaiju comes in to cause trouble in the city then they get defeated by Girdman and the series goes back to the status quo. Rinse and repeat.<br />
Along with the show&#039;s monster/kaiju of the week formula, the series uses a certain plot device that I have grown to dislike over the years and that is Amnesia. If you don&#039;t know what Amnesia is then is basically a person who has no memory thanks to a certain event that caused him to lose memories and they essentially walking husks on screen until set character of set series gets they memory back. It is a plot device that essentially takes a big shit of the plot for set show as set show is literally forced to follow every amnesiac plot device possible and it&#039;s honestly tedious to watch.<br />
SSSS Gridman is no different to this and as a result, the series was a chore to watch as we just see this our amnesia protagonist defeat Kanju left and right without a second thought.<br />
<br />
When the show finally stops being this generic monster of the week in the last couples the series is being a boring God story with our main antagonist Akame and no surprise it&#039;s generic.<br />
Finally, you can tell that Trigger was holding back/ I understand Trigger wanted to play itself after the disaster that was Darling in the Franxx but unfortunately there is a huge difference between playing itself and simply holding back for no reason and it really shows.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s any silver lining to SSSS Girdman to speak of it was the show is simply a fun throwback to not only the mecha anime genre from the past but the Tokusatsu genre as a whole. While I personally cannot get into the Tokusatsu genre myself, I will admit it genre has its appeal and anyone who is a fan of the Tokusatsu genre would probably have a good time with SSSS Girdman. It&#039;s such a shame the narrative isn&#039;t all that good to back it up.<br />
<br />
The characters in SSSS Girdman were easily the weakest part of SSSS Girdman. They aren&#039;t terrible but they don&#039;t stand out all that much outside of a certain character trait for the most part.<br />
Yuuta is your typical mecha/high school boy shounen protagonist that we all have seen before. Thanks to his amnesia in the narrative, he has no real personality to speak off. He doesn&#039;t grow as a character all that much and just simply a bore to watch. Even more boring than Katsuhira from Kiznaver.<br />
Rikka started off as a decent character at first but she sadly devolved into a meme as the series progressed.<br />
Shou is just there. He doesn&#039;t offer much to the story other to be a semi-useless sidekick for Yuuta.<br />
<br />
The only slightly decent main character in the show is Akane as she has a decent motivation of killing all the Girdman. I really enjoyed how after she had peeled her cute face as she turned into a proper psycho. She was the most entertaining thing about this mediocre series.<br />
The rest of the characters are just there. They not terrible but they not memorable as well.<br />
<br />
Compared to the unpolished Trigger+ Cloverworks that was Darling in the Franxx the visuals in SSSS were pretty appealing for the most part.<br />
The characters deigns are very distant and pretty to look at thanks to the beautiful smooth colour palette that was used to colour each character, Kanj and Gridman mecha itself which was nicely designed. The background scenery was well drawn as it had a lot of detail.<br />
The animation was pretty solid for what it was however at the time it got a bit choppy in certain fights least it&#039;s not as bad as Franxx second half although the CGI itself could have been a lot better as it was janky at times.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is alright for what it is but not that memorable.<br />
The opening and ending themes were decent but nothing too special.<br />
As for sub vs dub well, this was a tricky one because I only saw the last 2 episodes subbed as I mainly watched this show dubbed and it was great and it manages to surpass the sub which was already pretty good on its own. The voice actors really did an excellent job with the roles they were given as it was well acted and nicely directed.<br />
<br />
I really wanted to like SSSS Girdman I really do, but the series was ultimately average at best and underwhelming at worst. The story is for the most part boring, the characters are as interesting as eating eggs with no salt and the show overall lacked energy.  The only things that were good about this show were the visuals, soundtrack and the English dub everything else is mediocre at best. <br />
<br />
Unless you&#039;re into the Tokusatsu genre I cannot recommend this show to people especially who are Trigger fans such as myself.<br />
You&#039;re honestly better watching Planet With or King of Braves series over this.<br />
<br />
Better luck next time Trigger.

    SSSS.Gridman was a weird show. It is the result from the makers of Ultraman and Gridman together with studio Trigger. It is good and it is bad. There is a lot which surprised me and there was a lot of lost potential. This anime was not good and not bad, but very likable<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
First thing that putt me off was the CG. It felt sluggish and painful to watch as i&#039;m not a fan of bad CG. But in the end it got better and better, so I forgive the first few episodes. The world itself and the monster design are not something to get hyped

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338937">
        about and are simply lacking something to make it interesting. The details and the cameo&#039;s in this show was what did hype me<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Grue Elise von Mir plays in the background, so that was more than enough. Jk what i missed in this was a badass music track what Trigger always has to hype up the action. The sound effects were okay. The overall sounds impression was average.<br />
The positive: the voice acting of most of the cast was fabulous. Rikka sounds just as soft as her thighs, Akane was a perfect oppai loli. As for the rest of the cast i think they could have more emotion<br />
<br />
Characters and Story:<br />
Well the story on itself wouldn&#039;t be worth an 8, and the cast neither, so it was really a mix between good plot and good cast. While Trigger gives its own spin to the story and cast, the first few battles feels a lot like Ultra man. Simply beating up bad guys. But as the story and fighting choreography progresses, there are some shocking twists.<br />
<br />
Yuuta, a bit generic, but not to cheesy. Has to balls actually try and get a girl, but doesn&#039;t push trough. Not much of a mc<br />
<br />
Shou, Yuuta&#039;s friend but not much of a character either. While he feels much more &quot;weeb&quot;, his presence is just to balance out the party.<br />
<br />
Rikka, the only right character there is. Thicc thighs, a dreamy voice and a lovely character. While she isn&#039;t the one who actually does the action, her dialogues and thoughts show a bit how the world is built up.<br />
<br />
Akane, an oppai lolli with marvelous acting talent. Self conflicted she has to find out the trough by herself with hardship.<br />
<br />
As you can see the characters themselves are not super interesting, the interactions and the follow up on actions is what was intriguing. The way it played out because they held back information or just spouted it out was what made it enjoyable to figure out and watch. The fights advance in the very end just like the character Anti slowly evolves.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Somehow i think this anime was enjoyable and it left me with a good feeling. There are a lot of loose ends and plot holes, but that was actually never the focus of the story. The little cameo&#039;s in this anime showed that Trigger still cares and loves its old work. This Trigger made anime is for you if you like mecha, thighs, some existential crisis.

    Anime consumers typically stay loyal to certain genres or a specific franchise when they purchase goods. I’m not an avid fan of collecting anime merchandise but I&#039;ve seen people with stacks and shelves filled with anime figures. Out of all the genres though, mecha seems to be one that I’ve always been fascinated by. In recent years, it seems mecha shows have caused a bit of controversy. From Full Metal Panic to Darling in the Frankxx, they can either be really, really good or pretty damn despicable. <br />
<br />
Perhaps we shouldn’t jump too far ahead. Studio Trigger has been able to produce series with memorable quality

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296498">
        from their lineup. Sure, Darling in the Frankxx was a show that had a divided fan base but who can forget some of their other phenomenal work like Kill la Kill or Little Witch Academia? SSSS.Gridman got announced during Summer 2017 and to think, it also stands out as a celebration for the 25th anniversary of the original Denkou Choujin Gridman from 1993. I think if you’re a fan of tokusatsu programs, then you may be prepared for a treat. But if you’re not, be prepared for a wildly bizarre adventure.<br />
<br />
I should say right off the bat that SSSS.Gridman’s synopsis may take a few times to read before getting a first impression of what the show may be really about. It reminds me of a bit of blending between the Western and Japanese culture. We have mecha that somehow reminds me of Transformers, action heroes that feel like they are in the role as Power Rangers, and battles that resemble Pacific Rim. When I was young, there was a time when I watched Power Rangers especially the classics like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. However, I was never too big in the Ultraman franchise despite also being a tokusatsu classic. When people mention Ultraman, SSSS.Gridman also comes to my mind with the similar style of presentation. The first few episodes quickly unravels a dark plot about Akane Shinjo. As a central antagonist, she has a troubling personality and holds disturbing grudges towards those who “wrongs her”. She could be someone you would call a sociopath and can be highly manipulative. When we meet Akane the first time, it doesn’t take long to realize that there’s something deeply wrong about her inner personality. And honestly, a type of character like her easily brings in trouble into the main story.<br />
<br />
Of course, our main story involves protagonist Yuta Hibiki who wakes up with no apparent memory. As the human host of Gridman, he fulfills the role of an action hero. That is, he fights the Kaiju (the main monsters in the show) and protects the innocent. You could say he is the show’s friendly neighborhood Spiderman type of guy who swings into action when trouble knocks at doors. Thankfully, he gets assistance not just from Gridman but also from his friends. These the Gridman Alliance such as Shou, Rikka, and members of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students. The show reveals more about their roles as Yuta develops an alliance between them. However, the elephant in the room should be addressed. Why should you care about a story that resembles something done over a decade ago? <br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, most anime fans tends to favor genres that they’ve really experienced with. SSSS.Gridman blends a variety that’s draws the line of science fiction, mecha, and super hero. The plot isn’t hard to understand but may take some take to get attached to. Mainly, some of the first half resembles more of the Monster of the Week format where a hero fights against an enemy, defeats it, and saves the day. But don’t worry, the show does get more complex later on that deals with their world and Akane herself. I’m not going to throw spoilers as the show gets fairly dark as every episode progresses. Maybe that’s even an understatement because right from the start, this show had an unsettling mood. I’ll make this crystal clear now. Characters that die doesn’t just result in death but disappear completely. Erased from seemingly existing. If that doesn’t instill a sense of fear, then I don’t know what does.<br />
<br />
Beyond the dark story, we’re also treated with character relationships that play some key emphasis on the show altogether. Akane, Yuta, and Rikka stars as the main characters and they connect on a level that is fairly important. By understanding each other, they establish character connection that the viewers can get invested in. This is especially true to learn about character motivations such as Rikka’s desire to be a hero despite wanting to live a normal life. Or in the opposite case, Rikka’s resentment and desire for revenge for those who wronged her. Indeed, Rikka is a complex character, perhaps one of the hardest to accept but also incredibly enticing to watch for her unpredictable role. Her character expressions often hides her façade like a monster would. It’s as if she’s always wearing a mask as a beautiful creature on the outside and a harbinger of death on the inside.<br />
<br />
With 12 episodes, some questions popped to my head made me wonder if it’s really enough. Despite the show having a more serious storytelling, it still retains lighthearted moments and humor. Not to mention, we also got an obligatory beach episode to service the fans and one other particular episode to showcase Kajiu’s human-like behaviors. Viewers will also likely to poke fun at some of the character interactions and behaviors such as Akane’s hikikomori-like lifestyle. I think what the producers were aiming for is resurrecting this franchise as a way to pay homage to the original series while crafting its own story. It definitely succeeds at that when committing to its genres without stepping out of its comfort zone.<br />
<br />
Among the many elements of the show, one that’s impossible to evade is the style of its artwork. Studio Trigger has been known to make some extravagant cinematography with its battle contents. Here, SSSS.Gridman succeeds in similar ways. The action is over the top like how a tokusatsu show should be. From the first few episodes, it manages to showcase just how dangerous the Kajiu are and what they can do. Gridman himself has abilities that can neutralize monsters such as energy lasers and is incredibly durable as a fighting Hyper Agent. Make no mistake though. The monsters themselves are formidable ranging from the debut of Ghoulghalias to the deadly Devadadan. Each of them are decorated with impressive fighting capabilities and poses a threat to humanity. Similar to Godzilla in size, it’s nightmares coming to life in their world. The CGI was easy to get accompanied to and adds a colorful style to the overall character designs. Oh and before I forgot to mention, Rikka has some really meaty legs.<br />
<br />
I should say while SSSS.Gridman is more suitable for the Japanese audience, it can hit home for newer fans too. Prior to watching this show, I had little experience with tokusatsu related shows outside of Ultraman. Hell, Ultraman was an iconic franchise but that hasn’t been resurrected as a full anime show in a long time (2019 does have one though). Outside of Asia, tokusatsu had limited popularity so perhaps SSSS.Gridman could raise the bar. Funimation dubbed the series for the Western audience we may see more coming ahead.

    (WARNING: Some spoilers)<br />
<br />
I’ll admit being fairly biased when it comes to most TRIGGER produced shows, especially with the likes of Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Kiznaiver. So when the announcement for SSSS Gridman (or as I call it, SSSS Sleepman) came around, I was initially hyped and hoping that this series gives me a more positive outlook for mecha series in general. However, a little later on, when the visuals for the character and kaiju designs were released for the public eye to see, a part of me thought “the show is gonna do something to really upset or bore me”. At the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296503">
        time, I genuinely hoped my suspicions were wrong and that I would be able to overlook this sense of doubt I had, so I kept a fair amount of optimism heading into the season of Fall 2018. I mean, even the PV made it seem really promising.<br />
<br />
Now when I think about it, I don’t think I’ll ever comprehend why Gridman supposedly deserves so much praise, even if I understand why it does. I understand that my opinion is probably in the minority and that I might get called out by excessively sensitive fans of this show or tokusatsu-related stuff in general. Nevertheless, I want to try to at least explain why I think SSSS Gridman, which is actually based off of a retro tokusatsu series called Ultraman, is the most “over-praised” show I’ve ever watched in a long time.<br />
<br />
STORY: 2/10<br />
The story starts off with a young man named Yuuta Hibiki waking up without any prior memories, later befriending the likes of Rikka “Thunder Thighs” (a nickname I decided to go with) Takarada amd Shou Utsumi, who said they are his fellow classmates. Yuuta later meets Hyper Agent GRIDMAN through an ancient-as-hell PC, who tells him to “fulfill his purpose”.  All the sudden, a kaiju appears out of nowhere, setting the stage and course for the show.<br />
Right off the bat, the show wants to use the “amnesia” factor, a plot device that is often misused, especially in many sci-fi shows. Yuuta’s lack of memories limited his capacity to think or act in a logical manner, and without the likes of Gridman and his friend circle, he probably would be going off making too many ridiculous mistakes. Even the eventual revelations regarding Yuuta’s memories were cheaply written to make him look even more like not just a generic “chosen one” with plot armor, but a literal deus ex machina manifestation. So you’re telling me that the Yuuta we’ve followed throughout the entirety of the show ain’t really Yuuta at all, but actualy Gridman in a “Yuuta” body that had NO memories to begin with? Regardless of the details, that’s not exactly the best way to go about with a character you’ve decided to give up making a decent backstory on. Heck, only maybe one character in the entirety of the show got a fairly good structure in terms of background….I’ll get to that later, though.<br />
<br />
As for the structure of the show itself, it is basically a rinse-and-repeat episodic format. While I’m okay with episodic formats most of the time, this show doesn’t really know how to give much more structure outside of a kaiju/character of the week theme with 15-20 minutes of detached character dialogue and awkward durations of silence during certain frames, usually centered around adolescent school life, followed by 5-10 minutes of wonky, mostly CG-fied action coupled with intentionally cheesy names for transformations and attacks. The first few episodes seem quite fine due to the appeal of the action, but afterwards, you’d have to think it’d get boring due to lack of proper exposition and emotion. When the story finally does get some sort of progression due to the constant atmosphere the show tries to emulate, it’s very underwhelming even with the plot twists that try to be very compelling.<br />
<br />
Let me bring some pet peeves I had with the story: apparently, Akane is a main antagonist for the majority of the show, and at one point, was considered the “god” of this apparently “fake” world that the story takes in, due to the generic backstory of “not really having many friends, if at all”, and thus wanting to create an ideal world for herself (though it’s later revealed that Alexis played a major part for that in terms of pulling the strings…typical ass villain shenanigans). Our main group did find out at some point that Akane was responsible for making the kaijus that were causing havoc. While I can agree that Akane does not seem like a true villain despite her odd, “fuck everything else” manner, and that they should not go ahead and kill her….why the hell did they not at least try to physically stop her in some other way? Logically, wouldn’t that provoke the real baddie to take action and reveal himself, so that the good guys can finally face the true adversary? Then the story wouldn’t need to try to overdose the audience with so much mystery elements and force drama at the end to make itself seem more compelling in nature.<br />
Likewise, Akane at some point found out that Yuuta is the vessel of Gridman and the cause of her failures with the artificial kaiu, and was able to physically meet him when he is still a normal human being….why does she not, at the time, try to kill him when she’s in the perfect position to do so, or even call Alexis to do the dirty job? It really seemed like the backstory around her tried to make an excuse as to why she didn’t try to eliminate the good guys during the handful of times she had the opportunity. The rush to make her a sympathetic antagonist was not very appealing, considering that she displayed no redeemable character qualities to begin with…trying to make her be savvy in tone and mannerism is such a generic gimmick to make gullible viewers buy into her more easily. One more thing, the series’s attempts to be clever with giving clues to the mystery are just nothing more than something to try to keep the audience more interested.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7/10<br />
For the most part, the soundtracks are honestly quite solid, but I will say that the opening and ending theme are polar opposites in nature. The opening theme, sung by OxT, is a very grandiose soundtrack that would fit more with most shounen shows...heck, it actually sounds like something that belongs in the likes of stuff like Digimon, Cardfight Vanguard, and Yugioh. The ending theme, on the other hand, sung by Maaya Uchida, who is well known for her contributions to several Chuunibyou theme songs, as well as voicing the main heroine of that show (whom is, coincidentally enough, is also named Rikka….who woulda thunk it). The visuals of the ending theme, which I want to note here in particular, showcase shots of Rikka and Akane, making them seem very close friends. This isn’t very surprising because the ending theme would be made to fit in shows centered on school drama and/or adolescent romance.<br />
<br />
The rest of the soundtracks are nice, but very sparse and not utilized enough, because the majority of the show is filled with silent still-frames. The voice acting is kinda lifeless or bland, and any sort of emotion seemed very forced to an attempt to balance out the lack of cohesiveness and chemistry in terms of dialogue.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: 6/10<br />
First off, the 2D animation is actually hella good, and felt very reminiscent of the good ol’ Trigger shows, except they look hella cleaner and more detailed. There’s nothing much else to say about that.<br />
<br />
Now here’s a big bugaboo: the CG animation. Now before you say why I have to have such an issue regarding 3D animation, I’ll just say this: blame the number of other shows I’ve watched that literally traumatized me with their eye-burning showcases of horrible CGI usage. To be very honest, the 3D designs ain’t that all bad, but their overall movements, especially during the action scenes, felt very wonky…..in particular, the fake kaijus. Again, it points back to how much this show wants to trap the audience in tokusatsu nostalgia by trying to “perfectly emulate” how tokusatsu shows were produced. The wobbly 3D figurines of the kaijus are supposed to imitate someone walking in a monster costume, and the sequences of Gridman getting bigger are supposed to mirror how tokusatsu shows use camera tricks and angles. However, all of this supposedly masterful elements of “creating art” is simply the show choosing more “style over substance”, which is almost never a good thing in the current era of anime. Because of this, the action scenes just felt very awkward to me.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 4/10<br />
I touched upon some stuff regarding Akane much earlier, so I don’t think I’ll need to repeat for her.<br />
<br />
The characters of this show, while not god awful, are too bland to really make enough of an impact. Considering the lack of life the show has in general, the cast themselves just don’t really have any unique perks about them would make them legitimately likable characters.<br />
<br />
Yuuta looks like someone that should’ve belonged to a frigging shounen series, where he would’ve gotten more of a chance for actual character development as well as a more structured background…instead, he comes off as just a bland, mostly clueless individual who is only relevant because he’s the main vessel of Gridman.<br />
<br />
Rikka seems like a decent character at the start, due to her acting more like a realistic individual compared to the other cast members, but ultimately got sucked into the usual tropes surrounding “friendship”, which I felt deconstructed her…in the end, she is simply meme fodder due to her thick-as-f*** thighs.<br />
<br />
Utsumi. Is. USELESS. He’s simply the typical middle man wearing glasses who feels compelled to overreact to literally anything and everything he’s not familiar with or prepared for. Ultimately, he’s just a fake main character swept up by this sh**storm of a story.<br />
<br />
Akane is a character who actually got the most decent of backstories and characterization in the entire show, but what doesn’t feel right to me is that the show tried too hard to make her a sympathetic antagonist, as I mentioned much earlier. She can be waifu material, I guess, but she ain’t mine. Not with that twisted persona…no, not at all did I feel any sympathy for her, I’m sorry. Even with the interesting revelations at the end regarding the truth about her and the world, that by itself does not give a redeemable impression of her.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast just seem hella bland, too. The kids from the school really are just there for the background, regardless of whether or not they’re there cause it’s some fake world or something. Even the self-named “Neon Genesis” gang of the human avatars of Gridman’s equipment are one-dimensional and quite forgettable in all honesty. Calibur and Max did look cool at first, but the lack of depth just makes them fodder characters only made relevant due to being associated with the main characters. There is one notable character that I did honestly give a nod to: the human Kaiju. His constant drive to want to beat Gridman was initially very obnoxious, but after interactions with the likes of more sane humans like Rikka (cause f*** Akane), as well as watching Gridman’s battles from the sidelines, he started to really question himself as to what his purpose should be, and whether or not he had to find a new reason to fight and/or live. This was, however, downplayed by yet another deus ex machina implementation, where his evolution turned him into basically an entity almost exactly like the original Gridman. I don’t understand why they needed to fall back to such lazy scriptwriting like that for him. As for Alexis, he’s just a typical run-of-the-mill villain who only attempts to seem different by sounding savvy and friendly whenever possible, which is just lame way to go off the status quo.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 4/10<br />
Now before anyone tries to get at me saying I don’t understand tokusatsu….trust me, I’ve watched quite a bit of tokusatsu films back when I was very young, though I have forgotten the majority of which films exactly that I watched back then. I completely understand the nod to tokusatsu shows that this series tried to make and then emulate. I get it! Ok?! Honestly, though, tokusatsu shows are better off sticking to live action, in my honest opinion. In anime form, it just doesn’t really transfer over well.<br />
While I will say that as JUST as a straight-up recreation of tokusatsu, this show does extremely well and would deserve at least a B+ for it. But in terms of being an anime series in general, it doesn’t cut it due to the lack of character structure, superfluous storywriting, and the constant need to puff out copious amounts of nostalgia clouds.<br />
<br />
After around five to six episodes in, the redundancy of each progressing episode lowered my levels of expectations and excitement, to where I decided to no longer include the show in my reactions on my own YouTube channel. Despite this, watching the show on my own time was not that far off from feeling like a chore up until the final stretch, where the show tried to be interesting with the revelations and plot twists. However, it failed to really appeal to me enough outside of flashy action scenes.<br />
<br />
FINAL WORD: <br />
While I don’t think this is a necessarily awful show, I honestly believe that this show is just “gassed up” for the most part, and is honestly tasteless. The series tends to use the nostalgia factor and mecha action appeal to try to make itself look good, but lacks in structure and depth in terms of story and characters. It’s honestly one of the most underwhelming shows I’ve ever watched in recent years.<br />
<br />
If you do want to watch something based off retro shows that has actual depth, solid storywriting, and interesting characters, here’s one series I’d recommend: Casshern Sins (based off 1973 Casshan show). That show has heavy themes and well-written characters, and while its nature of its story pacing feels weird, thus making it a hard recommendation, there is considerably more emotion and thought-provoking elements; the action scenes in that show, while not very common, are actually quite entertaining as well.<br />
<br />
If you’re that kind of person who will try to watch and enjoy a show with your brain turned off, I’d say go ahead and knock yourself out. Whether you like it or not, that’s your choice. I’m by no means trying to force you to not watch it or change your perspective on it. I’m simply stating my good-to-honest thoughts regarding a show that people tried to give too much credit to.

When I started watching Gridman I went in with high hopes, these are talented people, trigger was one of my favourite studios. but after 5 episodes I was kind of disappointed. I could appreciate how similar it is to the old tokusatsu shows but that didn&#039;t impress me. So after 5 or so episodes, I was ready to write it off as just a passion project that would only appeal to a small group of people.<br />
<br />
Boy was I wrong.<br />
<br />
After the first few episodes gridman really starts to come into its own and stops being just a passion project and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389591">
        starts to be a piece of media worth celebrating. A lot of people have considered gridman to almost be a stain in triggers catalogue. But in my opinion, this is the close thing to a gainax anime the trigger has made.<br />
<br />
But after episode 6 we finally get some answers and gridman finally comes into its own as a story. At this point, it&#039;s clear that Akane isn&#039;t all that she seems, how she is constantly craving attention and how she kills someone she mildly dislikes. But now we find out why.<br />
<br />
Akane is god.<br />
<br />
but after Yuuta start defeating her kaiju Akane&#039;s fantasy starts to crumble. Akane no longer has control. She is no longer all-powerful and can&#039;t do anything about it. So she creates anti. But even anti starts to become more human and defies Akane&#039;s control. There is a line in episode seven that is &quot;if you can&#039;t find your own identity, then it is impossible to describe who you are as a person&quot; (and as it says person it immediately cuts to Akane) which in my opinion perfectly sums up her character. She has not found an identity and instead is just using her power as a god to make everything work out for her. Because of the way she abuses her power as a god she is lonely. She has never worked on herself and instead uses kaiju to constantly fix all of her problems. She is running away from real life which brings me to the second main theme of gridman. Escapism.<br />
<br />
Effectively criticising escapism in anime is hard as anime tends to be an escapist fantasy. Gridman is no different having its first few episodes being a light-hearted tokusatsu show that seems to be aimed at people who are nostalgic for those old tokusatsu shows. But gridman takes a different approach and doesn&#039;t just state that escapism is bad but instead shows us someone who has the power to live in their own fantasy and not be troubled by the day-to-day problems of real-life and it shows us how lonely and depressed Akane is because she can&#039;t meaningfully connect to anyone because she is a god. People only like her because she made them that way so while Akana is living her fantasies she is truly alone.<br />
<br />
Utsumi also used to show the issues with escapism and living a fantasy. Utsumi is living the dream. He gets to see his gridman fighting kaiju and he loves it. But when the rug gets pulled out from underneath him and some actually gets hurt, his best friend Yuta. And then when everyone takes a proactive role in stopping the kaiju assault he can&#039;t do anything. He just sits next to an unconscious Yuta. And just reflects on how his dream harms others and how living this escapist fantasy of constantly fighting kaiju is going to eventually cause something horrible to happen.<br />
<br />
And while we are on the topic of fantasies it&#039;s important to mention episode 9 because it is one of the best episodes of the series and it encompasses this whole theme of dreams. This episode shows the characters in their dreams where everything is perfect for them and Akane. But there is an uncanny feeling that something is wrong. This atmosphere is made by having a distinct lack of background music and then piercing this silence pulling you out of this dream-like atmosphere. In all of these sequences, there is a constant feeling that the characters have that something is off, and while this is perfect they need to wake up and face reality. In Yuta&#039;s dream, Akane states that &quot;if you&#039;re having fun then what&#039;s the matter&quot; in response to Yuta questioning why something feels wrong and she also says &quot;wouldn&#039;t you rather dream forever?&quot; which shows the key difference between Akane and the rest of the cast. They chose to wake up. Even though their dreams were perfect they chose to wake up and face reality. While Akane is still dreaming.<br />
<br />
In the final scene when Akane becomes a kaiju Anti comes and rips open her closed-off self and pulls her out of her closed-off kaiju and defeats Alexis. A manifestation of her darkest thoughts. And in the final scene live-action scene, Akane wakes up from her dream and faces the light. Akane finally broke out of her dream and faces reality.<br />
A quick note of the visuals of the series. All the characters look extremely distinct and the animation is fluid, visually the show is impressive until you get to the kaiju fights where the CG looks incredibly jarring but it does improve as the series goes on.<br />
<br />
The last 6 episodes of gridman are great and if I had to rate them separately it would be an 8/10 but the early few episodes are what drags down the series for me.<br />
<br />
TLDR: While gridman is a simple monster of the week tokusatsu show in the first half it becomes its own show in the second half which make up for it.

    Opinions on SSSS.Gridman are widely divided: you either love it or hate it. Interestingly enough, those who hate it all have similar criticisms, mainly the premise is unoriginal, the title is stupid, the action just rips off Ultraman, etc. To such comments I would say: do your homework and maybe you’ll learn something. The source material (because yes, this is based on something) was a sentai show from the height of the tokusatsu era. And let’s face it, every sentai show has at least 87% Ultraman-inspired content. It just goes with the territory.<br />
<br />
Regarding the story however, Trigger has decided to move away from the typical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293789">
        Power Ranger-esque scenarios and inject more characterization and atypical pacing into the anime. This, I think is a good thing. The original Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad (yes it is a dumb name, and yes it is misspelled for the sake of alliteration. Blame DIC Entertainment, who brought Gridman to the US market for that.) was probably even less popular in the US than contemporary shows like Beetleborgs. So switching up the story for the anime gives opportunity to rise above mediocre sentai action to something with actual substance. The show mixes the expected kaiju fights with slice-of-life scenes along with unexplained plot points yet to be revealed. Is there a *reason* everyone in the town seems somewhat bland and full of ennui? Is there more to the town then appears at first glance? And WTF is with the insanely immense ever-present daikaiju that everyone just kinda ignores? Only story development and plot progression will tell. =)<br />
<br />
And the characters themselves play a large role in that development as they themselves progress in their relationships and understanding of the world around them. And character development involves realistic situations in slice-of-life environments, not the continual amped-up, hyper, in your face action of a typical shonen anime. Heck, there’s more fight scenes in MHA, but the cast doesn’t run around in rage mode all the time (except Bakugo, but he’s... unique).<br />
<br />
The animation is decent, granted not Trigger’s best, but sufficient for conveying the jagged atmosphere of a robot-versus-giant-monster scenario. And the music, while sparse, matches the understated feel of the characters well. <br />
<br />
So, it’s a mecha/kaiju anime with a different slant that pays homage to its roots. It’s not Gundam, it’s not Code Geass, heck, it’s not even the original Gridman. There’s plenty of shows out there like those but there’s not many anime that feel like SSSS.Gridman. But I’m glad there’s at least one =)

    Anime 👏 Review 👏 <br />
<br />
First of all, I don&#039;t think Gridman is underrated. As I was watching Guriddoman I felt a sense of emptiness in the show and I started wondering about what others thought about this show. So I thought I would write my honest review of this show.<br />
<br />
Story: The story revolves around this yung redhead lad who has amnesia. This dude goes on trip and talks to a computer and they fight together against Godzillas. This is simplified episode synopsis for the initial 5 episodes. This made it feel like I was watching some pokemon episodes where main characters are doing their thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294790">
        until obnoxious antagonist arrives and the protagonist defeats em. It felt like watching same episode over and over again. What was able to keep me watching was big bob the builder (referring to boobs) girl and the dark gurren lagann looking thing. The plot never had anything else interesting in it to keep me hooked for the first 4 episodes. In general Gridman felt like I was watching some lame ass mecha PG-7 anime for children(minus the parts where Akane ordered to kill someone). <br />
<br />
Characters: We have a MC with amnesia. This is a good start since it fucking destroys his whole personality(not like there was any in the beginning because of amnesia). We have MC&#039;s friend who doesn&#039;t neither show almost any personality aside from drooling for Akane (big bob girl). Main heroine is a tsundere bait that in reality just doesn&#039;t give a fuck. She doesn&#039;t show much of emotions aside from time to time some cute behavior so that she doesn&#039;t seem like to be just dead inside (She also learns to smile towards the end). Then we have team Gridman support group. This consist some forgettable characters and their only reason is to be Gridman&#039;s augementations. So the cast is Optimus Prime&#039;s sonic wing and super mode (Transformers: Cybertron), Gurren Lagann drill mode and sword mode (couldn&#039;t think any reference but sword is pretty generic). Not too original. To me only interesting characters are the antagonists Akane and Alexis echo. Akane&#039;s motives are lacking so Alexis is probably controlling her for it&#039;s own purpose.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: I won&#039;t tackle on this too hard but the fighting animations are orgasmic and on par with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. High Quality CG.<br />
<br />
Sounds: Musics are good too but nothing ground breaking. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and conclusion: I cant really enjoy anything in this show except <br />
for animation and sounds. It&#039;s just overall a mediocre mecha anime in my opinion.  Be sure to give me some (constructive) criticism if you feel like it, I would really appreciate it.

    TL;DR at the bottom. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters 2/10:<br />
Main Character has red hair and he is &quot;special&quot;. He is your everyday high-schooler with nothing that stands out about him. You could replace him with any generic main character from any anime and it won&#039;t change a thing.<br />
<br />
The main girl &quot;Rikka&quot; comes off as bored, uninterested and fed-up, all the time. She is sighing constantly and has no expressions. <br />
May be she is supposed to reflect the audience response while watching this anime. <br />
Only good thing about her is her character design, which is pretty good. <br />
<br />
MC has a generic supportive sidekick. But he is only there to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293607">
        friend-zoned and not threaten the MC&#039;s chances with the girl.<br />
Rest of supporting cast is also pretty ordinary. <br />
<br />
Story 2/10:<br />
A giant robot shows up and wrecks the city. MC fights the enemy with his own robot. MC wins. Next day everything resets to normal. <br />
Rinse. Repeat<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art 7/10:<br />
It is good. Most of the attention has been given to character of &quot;Rikka&quot; to make her look good. Too bad her personality is as interesting as a wet blanket.<br />
<br />
Animation 4/10:<br />
Animation is often choppy. Feels like they are trying to use less frames per second to save money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10:<br />
If you have watched more than a few good anime, you won&#039;t find it particularly enjoyable.<br />
Unless Mecha anime is your guilty pleasure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most People who like this anime have 1 reason only. That is the design of character &quot;Rikka&quot;. She has become somewhat of a meme for her &quot;THICC THIGHS&quot;. (Although I disagree that her thighs could be classified as thicc. But that&#039;s besides the point)<br />
<br />
It would have been better if the creators made an Ecchi anime or a Hentai. Atleast, that would have distracted from the weak story and bland characters.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The main problem with character of Rikka seems to be her Japanese Voice actress. This problem is less pronounced in Eng Dub.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR:<br />
 A red-haired guy fights a giant robot while his sidekick friend and a girl with thicc thighs watch him on a screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
**The girl sighs, puts her finger in her right ear and rotates it back and forth. Her face without any expression** <br />
Then she says in an uninterested tone &quot;This is taking too long&quot;

    (There will be spoilers in this review.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: For me personally, the word mediocre perfectly encapsulates it. I see people heaping a lot of praise on the CG of the Gridman, but being slightly better that your contemporaries, in this department, hardly warrants all the commendation. 2D animation can be summed up by the word decent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: I think this section is highly subjective. I didn&#039;t like nor the OP nor the ED, and can&#039;t remember a single piece of background music, but that doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t like any of the music in Gridman aswell, you&#039;ll just have to listen to it and find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296597">
        out for yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: It&#039;s sort of there, but at the same time it&#039;s not. Essentially, pretty much every episode follows an extremely simplistic formula of &quot;Have 15 minutes of inane chit-chat in a high-school-esque setting, then be alerted to the presence of a new Kaiju and have a 5-minute long one-sided fight&quot;, and that&#039;s about it. I will elaborate on what final episodes bring us a bit later.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Yuuta: He&#039;s not a character, he&#039;s merely a vessel for Gridman. The fact that he&#039;s an amnesiac is also very convenient cause that just takes off some work from the scriptwriter, as the typical amnesic character is defined solely by that trait and, therefore, doesn&#039;t require any personality at all.<br />
<br />
Utsumi: By his own admission in the last episode, a completely useless character that serve barely any purpose and is defined by a single trait of being a Kaiju fanatic.<br />
<br />
Rikka: At first she seems somewhat interesting, as she&#039;s protrayed as an apathetic person that sighs every 10 seconds and hardly seems interested in anything, but later evolves (devolves?) into your typical &quot;friendship is paramount and is above all else&quot; character.<br />
<br />
Akane: I will cover her more in-depth down the line.<br />
<br />
Hyper Agents: They&#039;re so cookie-cutter you can guess their personalities from their design. It seems like their reason d&#039;etre is to simply provide upgrades for the primary Gridman unit so he can show a new attack in an episode. They claim they have a purpose and are here to deal with Alexis, but strangely enough spent 85% of their time lounging in Rikka&#039;s shop, doing absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Rikka&#039;s mom: She&#039;s there. She mostly just cheers the main cast from the sideline, even though she appears to be bewildered by everything that&#039;s going on.<br />
<br />
Rikka&#039;s classmates: They&#039;re also there.<br />
<br />
Anti: A very moody young man who is defined by a single trait of wanting to destroy Gridman, as that his reason for existance. He later undergoes a character development after standing for 30 seconds in the rain and listening to Akane, after which he decides he&#039;s a good guy now.<br />
<br />
Alexis: He&#039;s an evil man that&#039;s evil, he takes pleasure in depraved acts of destruction and suffering of the people. Your typical Trigger antagonist.<br />
<br />
Ending analysis: My take on the ending is that Akane is actually a real-life person, that appears to be bullied at school, probably because she&#039;s geeky and nerdy, due to her affection for Kaiju and Gundams, so when she comes home she, probably, writes a story (aka the actual Gridman show we see), and that&#039;s her method of releasing her frustration and coping with the stress (as she destroys things, then fixes them right back, and also removes umpleasant characters).<br />
What supports this theory is that characters in the show recognize her as a god, just like writer is technically a god to the characters he created. The symbolism in Gridman and Alexis, is that Alexis is the evil within Akane, due to all the bullying, and Gridman is that proverbial remaining light of hope, which fixes everything by the end (he does this quite literally with his Fixer Beam). Rikka is just a perfect friend that Akane wishes she had in a real world. Utsumi low-key looks like a love interest Akane would&#039;ve liked, as he&#039;s a giant Kaiju geek and all. The final frames are also that of real world, shot with an actual camera, and we can see Rikka&#039;s gift to Akane on the table, which further confirms my idea. <br />
All said and done, by no means do I think this is correct, or anything plausible to begin with, but who knows. Seems a little too deep for a show that essential a one giant homegae to a lot of different titles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: A typical Trigger fair, style and action over subtelty and substance. I personally cannot recommend it, even if it had some interesting moments and, perhaps, even some meaningful and intersting concept that ended up being butchered.<br />
I think the original Gridman, with it&#039;s abundance of pyrothecnical effects and models of cities being crushed by actors wearing monster suits, is a vastly superior experience. But if that&#039;s (understandably) might not be your cup of tea, and you would rather watch some mecha anime, then I would recommend you Shin Getter Robo Armageddon, Gundam franchise (Zeta and 0083, specifically, are quite good) and even TTGL, even though I&#039;m not a fan of it.

    Fanbase of this anime remind me that Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei season II (Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei) episode 4 first part of three call &quot;A Painter by the Roadside&quot; when Itoshiki and his students talk about instances where people pay more attention to the trivial details of many objects rather than the main subjects. <br />
<br />
Because all the lovers of this anime are like &quot;best girl Akane&quot; &quot;Rikka doing nothing wrong&quot; &quot;that legs&quot; &quot;Plagiarism everywhere&quot; &quot;you check that tweet&quot; jaja is just so insane jaja and the plot of this anime, is just an average as fuck but 10/10 because Akane and Rikka best waifus, Trigger fan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295018">
        they are so alienated in their passion for the study that don&#039;t see the limitation for write good stuffs and don&#039;t put in a blender his old ideas and throw us in the face a story empty and without substance (i was looking at you Darling in the FranXX) they enter in a dynamic of trivial details<br />
<br />
That&#039;s what&#039;s happen with this anime. is good but is not underrated, is just an average anime, very average... <br />
<br />
Fiction overcomes fiction... and it has left me in despair
