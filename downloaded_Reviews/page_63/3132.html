    Story:<br />
Buddy Complex is a new mecha anime from Sunrise that does not push any boundaries, unlike Valvrave. However, the execution is very well done and keeps me entertained every week. The battles display differing tactics after failed attempts rather than having the same few machines doing the same few moves against each other, which happens in quite a few of Sunrise&#039;s previous mecha series. It is a delight to see how our main characters get out of the various difficult situations they are forced into.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
Coming from Sunrise, it is not much of a surprise that the art and sound are well done. The background music

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133039">
        during the battles and while they are on standby fit in very well, and the OP and ED are catchy. The battles scenes are amazing and do not have a noticeable amount of re-used scenes. It is a joy to watch for the art and sound alone.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
All of the characters seem ordinary. However, they are easily likable and feel human enough not to feel two-dimensional. Also, when they get emotional, there are clear reasons behind them (i.e. their emotional spurts do not seem to be pulled out of nowhere). There are also no noticeable plot holes that I have noticed while casually watching the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This is where the series shines for me. The anime does not become too ridiculous or too boring, and nothing about it bugs me.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime does not try to be anything out of the ordinary, but its excellent execution and animation keeps me coming back for more every week.

    Buddy Complex implicates two dramatically different ways from its setup. We get a normal high school student named Aoba Watase with friends, a smile on his face, and like most kids, likes to play sports when they’re bored. Then, it quickly shifts to a mysterious girl coming from the future to apparently save Aoba, giant mecha dropping from the sky to terminate him, and a time travel phenomenon that changes his life forever. Sounds complex right? That’s just the tip of the iceberg as the show doesn’t reveal much in the beginning. Everything comes out as cryptic and plays you around like a jigsaw puzzle.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138349">
        The only clues from the beginning are from the mysterious girl named Hina. Let the complexity ensure.<br />
<br />
As a show produced by Sunrise, the classic genre of mecha comes to mind. It doesn’t waste any time in the beginning as we witness several of those causing chaos and havoc at Aoba’s school. The confusing part is not only the HOW but also the WHY. It’s no surprise that the audience will have many questions. But for what’s worth, we do know that Aoba Watase is a loyal friend. Despite having no military experience in the beginning, he listens to every word that Hina has to say and even attempts to save her like the way she is trying to save him. But this initial setup also identifies itself as cliché in the beginning with its gimmicky characters. Taking a look on the surface, the story itself adapts a supernatural device (time travel) and forwards 74 years into the future. But the more complex part is what goes on in that future. For instance, there’s two sides that are seemingly begrudged in a war – the Free Pact Alliance and Zogilia Republic; two sides existing opposite of each other sharing the common goal to win through absolute victory. <br />
<br />
Events that does come together may sound typical but what happens in the future really ticks one’s mind when characters forwarded in time are seemingly different. For instance, Hina is almost nothing like the high school girl she debuted as. Instead, we are introduced to a Hina fighting for the Zogilia Republic as a loyal soldier. There’s little explanation in the beginning as to why her character went so much change and how she is there in the first place. But nonetheless, we also find out a character (Dio) that was mentioned by Hina as someone significant and possible benefactor to this futuristic world. Of course, Aoba remains clueless about everything goes on, probably in the same state as the viewers. Luckily, Aoba doesn’t change much and still maintains his characteristics as a loyal friend. Taking on the promise to find Dio, we quickly discover that Aoba has a special ability, the skill to perform the ‘coupling’. Again, this comes as a mystery because we know little about Aoba’s background besides his time at high school. What we still hope for are answers to these questions. The show itself explains in packages, little at a time. It does this first with the mechanics involving what ‘coupling’ is and how it’s performed. Then, it goes on explaining the two nations and its backgrounds in diligent yet unnerving ways. While all this makes sense, there’s a lack of interest because the big mystery still remains to why Aoba is involved with all of this. But do take time to familiarize with this show’s concepts as it does take patience to get through. After all, these concepts are complex by origins and even with cliches formulates a story for thought.<br />
<br />
Tossing theories aside, there’s something innovative about Buddy Complex with its character dynamics. Initially, the three main characters (Aoba, Dio, and Hina) have little to nothing in common with each other. Yet, they all somehow get connected in the story not through a coincidental match up but rather through fate. It brings back the time travel trope with the story as the show likes to pander around with secrets and revelations. At the apex of the story, we also find the mysterious pilot that came from the future to kill Aoba. Of course, Hina is there again but this time is seemingly confused by her own identity. And seemingly enough, identity is another issue as Hina doesn’t seems to know exactly who she is beyond her outer persona. As mystery would have taken hold at the core, Buddy Complex slowly yet vividly reveals little by little of its purpose. Whether it’s done through conversations, flashbacks, or just what’s there, the show does actually attempt to pull this out concisely. It also allows viewers to formulate their own theories and see if their predictions are valid in this typhoon of complexity.<br />
<br />
Despite the serious nature and warfare dedication of the series, there are moments for lighthearted scenarios. Although it sheds away some of the more tragic moments and brings out a different side, it follows a standard direction of witless context. For instance, the romance subplot between Aoba and Mayuka, another member of the alliance, often comes out as cheesy. It’s not just the dialogues but execution with the usual blushes, misunderstandings, and tawdry interactions. Then, there’s Aoba himself who stands out as nothing really appealing besides his dedication to his friends. Furthermore, we also have Fromm, another supporting character that exploit the princely figure that people seems to idolize. And although Fromm proves himself to be quite a capable player in the war, there’s little characterization besides his initial skill. The series also lacks a bit originality with the classic deserted island encounter, Zogilia’s conception relating to bigotry, and even Gundam Seed-esque installations. What we also do have is clash of ideologies and what the two sides are fighting for – Zogilia’s ambition to conquer the world and Free Pact Alliance fighting for freedom. It’s essentially a duel of wits to bring about a legend to be foretold; a crass legend but nonetheless. <br />
<br />
The action battles, in general, are outstanding with the rapid pace and intensity. One of the most mysterious device is the ‘coupling’ system, a weapon that can essentially turn the tides of the war. And while some of the battles lacks integrity, the show has strategy from both sides that demand teamwork, innovative maneuvers, and technological demonstration. Each mecha has its own specifications and designs with key elements. The results often serves as evidence to its performance. Whether successful or failure, it creates a sense of credibility with how technology has involved in the future. Even when not in a mecha suit, the characters also show various degree of military experience such as usage of firearms, explosives, and art of deception. On the other hand, the environment as well as the battlefield of the series can feel to be quite stale and generic. It negates a sense of embellishment for what the war has already created.<br />
<br />
Visual quality is courtesy of Sunrise, a studio no stranger with mecha themed shows. Therefore, expect similarity with some of its previous works in terms of mecha designs. Although most of them seems standard, more prominent mecha such as Aoba’s Luxon and Dio’s Braydon are featured with showcase moments. Character designs are also typical with Hina being the most mysterious with her beauty and secretive backgrounds. On the other hand, Aoba stands out as dull with nothing distinguishing to write home about. Fan service is minimal although poorly coordinated when the time calls for it. Nonetheless, it is consistent by Sunrise standards with its portrayal. Nothing earth shattering but acceptable.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack plays various roles throughout the series. While some of the OST undermines the serious nature of the atmosphere, there are also moments when it creates variety. In other words, it can shift quickly and simply depending on its scenario. For what’s worth, the OST makes sense whether it’s for emotional scenes, aerial warfare, or climatic moments. The OP song also plays on a decorative way of presenting nearly all the main and supporting characters with decent coordination. And technical wise, most of the characters’ voice mannerisms works well. I do criticize a bit for Aoba’s voice tone as he sounds dull and sometimes forced. The only moments his voice seems to come to life is during arguments he has with Dio and concern for Hina. It’ll take time for the ears to get used to so patience will be key here.<br />
<br />
Buddy Complex isn’t a mecha series that will influence future generations of mecha on what’s to come. After all, the term ‘mecha’ has a long history with the anime fandom. Sunrise built its studio on this foundation and presents Buddy Complex with a mixture of its ideas. Yet, to dismiss it entirely as cliche should be an overstatement. The show does offer a hook, to draw viewers into its story especially with so many questions. Whether this is an appeal to you or not will differ but simply put, the show isn’t just about robots fighting mindlessly. Just do be aware of its repetitive gags and some episodes that seemingly serves little development or characterization. It isn’t rocket science to understand Buddy Complex but neither is it that simple. Hopefully the second season will answer questions of complexity in the eye of the hurricane. <br />

    &quot;Connect with Dio&quot;<br />
&quot;Acception&quot;<br />
<br />
You would think that this is just some other Gundam rip-off, but no. It&#039;s a new kind of mecha where they bring in time travel and buddy thing as how the title is.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Its simple, the guy in the past go to future then become some cool character then the story slowly unfold how it ended up in 1st episode. War between two nations/country... robot mecha fight around, yea. I like mecha. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The character are normal, but the art of Luxon and Bradyon is nice, and when both of them in coupling mode is so damn cool, like how the wings glow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138171">
        and all the cg effects stuff. But the 2 mecha still look like some No-grade Gundam. If Buddy Complex have more budget, the mecha will definitely look nicer with a bit of more detail.  <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10 <br />
I like both the opening and ending, not bad except the ending give me the feel of watching gundam seed ending. Nevertheless, everything sounds right in this anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
I gonna admit, I like Hina a lot in this anime, just because of her long black hair and purple eyes and definitely how pretty she is. HINA HINA HINA!!!! And seeing how Aoba and Dio slowly become good buddy is really fun, like how they always quarrel with each other but still care about one another. Other character in the anime are also well developed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
All the coupling scene is damn nice! Like how fast Luxon and Bradyon move after they coupled. The fight scene and laser everywhere!!!! I also enjoy how Aoba always talking about Hina as though Hina is his only one. But it&#039;s really enjoyable to see fast action mecha fight that is not one sided, even when it is, it will and must be overwhelming!<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
SEASON 2!!!!!! So yea, they execute the ending for season 1 nicely, I thought it would be some Mahou Sensou&#039;s ending. The anime is enjoyable and no need to think so much when watching, because everything will be known episode after episode. And it&#039;s very straightforward anime. <br />
<br />
So if you are interested in Mecha genre anime, it&#039;s not a bad idea to catch this one because you won&#039;t have much disappointment in it. Not the best mecha but one of the few good one! :)<br />

    I found myself to like this show very much, surprisingly. You may think this is some weird, nerdy mecha anime with painstakingly slow plot progress your too lazy to watch, but Sunrise Studios has done it again. I really liked the funny interactions with each character in each episode, along with the love triangles and the &quot;world war&quot; vibes. The main character, Watase Aoba may look like those generic male characters and kinda is, but there is depth in many of the characters. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t also wait for the second season, cause this time they&#039;ll be romance, trust me, you won&#039;t regret watching this anime.

        The only mecha show I ever watched is Code-geass, and this show is just a mix of shonen and shoujo.

    This is my first Review of an anime since signing up with this site. I have used it for a long time, but never actually used it to keep track of what I had watched until recently. <br />
<br />
Buddy Complex turned out to be a fantastically enjoyable experience for me. It actually surprised me at how much i ended up enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
I found the story to be rather interesting. Sure, the premise has been done before, but buddy Complex handled it well. I never felt like i was being forced to accept the storytellers point of view at any time. It was written in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165445">
        a way that let me accept things right along with the protagonist. This is something that I feel is important when trying to tell a story, that I should never have to just accept that this or that happened for no obvious reason. There is no real complications to the story, so if you are looking for something to engage your mind, this won&#039;t be doing that. But it will entertain you like a good story should It lets you sit back and enjoy it without having to try an wrack your brain trying to figure out what is going on.<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
I really enjoyed the ship and mecha designs, and the characters were all done very well. Smooth animation, up to today&#039;s standards. Effects and action scenes were all done very well, and if you see a re-used scene then you would have had to be looking for it specifically. I didn&#039;t notice one while watching. Not much more to say here, top notch art for this one.<br />
<br />
Sound - 9<br />
OT and ET were good, the battle scenes music was great and fit very well. Sounds fit, characters voices were all done very well, there was depth to battle sounds that needed it, and I enjoyed the music. Not too varied, i will admit, but they used what they had well.<br />
<br />
Character - 9<br />
Not sure if people would disagree with me or not, but I really enjoyed the characters in Buddy Complex. They all felt so real. Relationships within the anime between characters felt like they were moving forward at a true pace, not forced or fake. Characters reactions happened realistically and you could understand each persons decisions when they got mad, or depressed. The main two characters Aoba and Dio really stood out for me. Aoba was not too over the top, considering his situation, and his personality was not unfirm. He made his decisions based on who he was, and what he knew. He was a strong, caring person who was stuck in an abnormal situation. His and Dio&#039;s relationship really mattered as things moved forward, and each step that it took the viewer could understand exactly how and why it did so.<br />
<br />
Perhaps no groundbreaking character personalities here, but you could tell the writers cared about why things happened in the anime, and not just what needed to happen.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
So much enjoyment for me in this. I really wasn&#039;t expecting to enjoy it this much when i started it. But each episode i watched i just liked it more and more. The fight scenes, the characters the story, it all wrapped up an engaging little package that made me feel happy to have opened it.<br />

    Second season? Seriously? I will probably watch it because it’s gonna be hard to make it more boring than first one, so maybe I won’t be so disappointed next time, but why just 4?  <br />
Story: 2/10<br />
What story? Only the first and the last episode were really worth watching - even though the whole “time travelling” thing doesn’t make any sense… Hey, I’m really curious how Aoba got into the future first time? Cause there must have been reason for Bizon to find him in the past, right? But I expected too much – the whole plot aimed to explain how Hina got in Aoba’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139681">
        world and that’s all. Rest of the story is vague and we would have not lost anything significant if they had cut off this 11 episodes. <br />
Characters: 5/10 <br />
Sorry, but cuteness is not any determinant for me. Characters are 100% schematic and their decisions tend to be reckless at least – with Aoba at the helm, and there’s nothing worse that irritating protagonist. <br />
Art+ Animation: 8/10 <br />
The only point to watch this anime. If you like to watch fighting mechas and colorful, bright and precise animation that’s anime for you. Plus – pretty girls and fancy uniforms;) <br />
Music: 5/10 <br />
Not bad, absolutely neutral. I have to admit that I am not able to call in my memory anything which could disturb my reception in some way. <br />
Enjoyment: 4/10 <br />
… Which was powered by unceasing expectation for something MORE than next the same looking battle or another character who disappears on following episode and doesn’t play any role in the series. As I wrote earlier – only animation met with my expectations. <br />
Overall: 4/10 <br />
This anime is wasted. It could be really great mecha series with some dose of mystery bound up with time travelling, which is just perfect instrument to make a little mess in our heads, but… <br />
It wasn’t such a waste of time after all, but I think this effect was possible only if you watch it week after week, because if you watch it at once there’s a danger that monotony will kill your enthusiasm. <br />

      Buddy Complex is a action/mecha type of anime recently aired in January 2014. I recently watched it and I find that it&#039;s very interesting and entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
 -What I would like to point out first is the Overall Design and the Sound of the anime:<br />
<br />
  It bugs me a lot seeing that the designing is so much similar to another mecha anime, Kakumeiki Valvrave. I understand that they have the same producer, and possibly some artists who worked on Valvrave, but it just annoys me. Otherwise, the other designs besides from the characters I find very original and it hardly bores

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151031">
        me with this art style. The  battle scenes are perceived very well as well as the music (OP/ED) and some background music during the anime.<br />
<br />
 -Secondly, the story:<br />
  <br />
  No offence to any Buddy Complex fans here but in my opinion, the story is highly predictable. However, it didn&#039;t stop me from being extremely excited and it is very tempted to watch the next episode after finishing one. The plot did a great job creating a scifi-action anime with a romantic kind of atmostphere at some parts.<br />
<br />
 -Overall:<br />
<br />
  This anime is extremely fun to watch and it is very intriguing to find out what&#039;s going to happen next. I would recommend this anime to anyone finding an anime with great artworks.

    I have seen many anime and most of the top ones. So what do I think about this anime compared to the likes of Steins gate and Code Geass? Well this anime is shit. There is absolutely nothing new here and everything is rather mediocre.... BUT I found a great deal of enjoyment watching it. Dio was ok and the main guy, whose name slips my memory, was rather enjoyable to watch as he has a strong personality and doesn&#039;t have an affinity for finding himself in awkward boob grabbing situations where he blushes and gets all embarrassed. The main reason to watch this anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196202">
        is Yumihara. One of my favorite Character designs and good voice acting. Really this anime hit all my weak points, and while it fails to break ground on anything it succeeds in entertaining and there is definatly merit in that. If your looking for a good Mecha/Romance anime give this one a try, you might be pleasantly surprised

    Buddy Complex is yet another addition to the string of near-indistinguishable mecha series that Sunrise seems to have no problem effortlessly churning out year after year alongside their usual Gundam installments. It&#039;s a pretty standard mecha show that on closer inspection has both standout qualities and heavy flaws.<br />
<br />
Right from the first episode alarms were going off in my head; this was going to be another time loop story. I really didn&#039;t have faith that the creators could successfully pull one off here, and to put it bluntly: they couldn&#039;t. It makes absolutely no sense and is barely understandable even once things are explained. The sheer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225175">
        amount of logical leaps and assumptions that have to be made when it comes to this time travel plot are astounding. It&#039;s like they saw Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica and thought they could do the same thing, without actually understanding how those shows work.<br />
<br />
However, with all of that being said, the time travel story has little to no bearing on the meat of the show, and merely bookends what is otherwise a typical mecha action series with its usual grab bag of tropes. So, for eleven of the show&#039;s thirteen episodes, you can almost forget about it and all of its stupidity—almost.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist, Aoba, finds himself sent seventy-or-so years into the future by his mysterious classmate, Hina, where he&#039;s flung right into a war between two opposing factions. As expected, he ends up piloting a giant mecha to fight for one of them. The series&#039; main gimmick, and explanation for the title, is actually something called the &quot;Coupling System,&quot; which involves two pilots connecting—not combining, but rather syncing up—mid-battle to increase their fighting abilities. A surprising amount of detail is given about how this system works and what effects it has on the pilots, although it can get a little jargon-heavy. At the end of the day, it&#039;s clearly a plot device to get the series&#039; main protagonists, Aoba and Dio, to develop as characters together. And, for what it&#039;s worth, that aspect of the show works pretty well.<br />
<br />
Aoba&#039;s disoriented outlook on the world and selfish desire to meet with Hina again naturally conflict with Dio&#039;s cold front and strict adherence to the military&#039;s rules, causing them to frequently butt heads. At first, Dio only values Aoba as a necessary component to the &quot;Coupling System,&quot; but does learn to respect and care about him as a person. Their interactions and chemistry become some of the series&#039; strong points, for sure.<br />
<br />
However, the same can&#039;t be said for the mechas themselves. Honestly, the mecha designs just don&#039;t appeal to me at all in this series. They&#039;re very much like those of Code Geass: sleek, vibrant, neon-colored, and complete with all sorts of jagged edges and pointy bits. Except, unlike with Code Geass, none of them have particularly interesting designs, and trying to tell the difference between each of them becomes a challenge in its own right amidst the fast-paced cuts of the action scenes. The action scenes as a whole fail to be too exciting, being that they almost always take place in the sky above never-ending oceans. Fight choreography is almost nonexistent, with most battles consisting of mechas firing lazers in ambiguous directions at ambiguous targets. Then, once the protagonists&#039; &quot;Coupling System&quot; activates, the battles further devolve into incomprehensible lazer light shows of flashy orbs that zip around the screen causing explosions in their wake. There&#039;s no real tension as you&#039;re unable to follow the flow of the action. The only response it might elicit from the viewer is the thought: &quot;Well, I guess they&#039;ve got it under control.&quot; From that point on, it&#039;s probably okay to space out. <br />
<br />
Though, I will give a shout out to the main theme that pops up near the end of most of these action scenes. It&#039;s one that&#039;s sure to catch your attention and maybe even have you believe that the fight you&#039;ve just slept through was actually grandiose and satisfying; hey, it worked for me at least. Unfortunately, while I have to give props to Sunrise for still bothering to traditionally animate their mechas, they&#039;re also guilty of resorting to CGI occasionally, and in this show that ratio is somewhere around 50/50. Some great animation could have really made up for the uninspired mecha designs, but more often than not it feels like you&#039;re just watching some toys floating around on screen. <br />
<br />
This show is by no means always ugly to look at, though. Strangely, this show has simultaneously generic and appealing character designs. I&#039;d be lying if I didn&#039;t say that the girls were super attractive, and if I swung a certain way, that the boys were as well. However, on their own they probably wouldn&#039;t stand out too much in the larger sea of anime designs. That&#039;s why it&#039;s definitely to the animators&#039; credit that the characters are consistently well-drawn and look great regardless. Particularly, their eyes are given lots of detail, and close-up shots are gorgeous. The character animation is also consistently fluid enough and comfortably above average. <br />
<br />
Given my contempt for this show&#039;s mecha fights, it&#039;s no surprise that I find its slower-paced episodes to be the strongest. Aoba&#039;s reflective trip to his dilapidated hometown was nice, as he reminisced about his school and his family. It was cool to see and put things into perspective. There&#039;s also a nice amount of comedy and lightheartedness among the different characters and crew of the Cygnus. Most of them are likeable enough, but just don&#039;t receive enough screen time. The same is true for the opposing faction, whose similarly large cast of characters just don&#039;t get the development that they need. Because of this, there are certain scenes that attempt to solicit more emotions from the audience than are probably deserved. <br />
<br />
Later in the show, we learn that Dio has certain family issues, concerning both his father and his sister. Aoba tries to act as a sort of mediator between them, initially much to Dio&#039;s chagrin. It&#039;s interesting to see Aoba&#039;s perspective on Dio&#039;s shaky relationship with his father as someone who no longer has the ability to talk with his own, and the drama that comes from this is not bad, although it does feel like more could have been done with it by the end of the series. Nevertheless, it serves as a nice counterpart of Dio&#039;s to Aoba&#039;s ongoing obsession with finding Hina. <br />
<br />
Hina herself is a double-edged sword of a character. Her character arc is fairly interesting, but it ultimately stems from the terrible time loop plot that sets the story in motion in the first place. However, if you can ignore that—and ignoring it isn&#039;t too difficult considering the worst of it only comes at the end when you learn what was supposed to have been happening—she&#039;s a worthwhile character with compelling hardships, who&#039;s forced to make decisions with real consequences. It helps that her design is especially great to look at, too.<br />
<br />
Now, allow me to go on a bit of a tangent:<br />
<br />
This show features a textbook example of what I like to call the &quot;Hopeless Third Wheel&quot; character. It&#039;s not that I necessarily hate these characters—they can be cute and have their own fun quirks—but rather, I hate the inevitable purposelessness that they&#039;re doomed to. These characters are always immediately identifiable: They&#039;re air-headed, soft-spoken, super nice towards the main character, and for whatever reason, they usually have short hair; tsundere varieties exist as well, and sometimes they&#039;re a childhood friend. You know they aren&#039;t going to matter to the main story, and they won&#039;t ever reach their one goal in life. What is that goal? To fuck the protagonist, of course; it&#039;s their main defining trait. Problem is, in the shows they usually inhabit, it&#039;s incredibly obvious who the main character&#039;s true love interest is, and therefore any progression with this &quot;Hopeless Third Wheel&quot; feels like a waste of time for her and for the viewer. <br />
<br />
Mayuka, here, fits this role to a T. That&#039;s a shame since she looks quite good and her personality is one of the less grating of this archetype. To be fair, she does get one nice episode where she accompanies Aoba on his aforementioned trip to his hometown, where she gives him support and helps him figure out what he needs to be doing. But, at best, that&#039;s all the &quot;Hopeless Third Wheel&quot; can ever accomplish: locking herself in the ground to provide support for the male lead and subsequently staying there, never moving for her own sake, and never having the resolve to actually get with him as an equal. That&#039;s why they lose, and that&#039;s why they&#039;re frustrating to watch.<br />
<br />
Anyway... It&#039;s important to note that this show ends on an extremely rushed final episode that even leaves off on a cliffhanger. But, everything is okay, for a short two episode finale was made to finish it all off. Well, it would&#039;ve been okay if the sequel wasn&#039;t actually even stupider than the series was at its dumbest. If you thought the time shenanigans weren&#039;t too bad here, just wait until you watch that. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to say if Buddy Complex was too ambitious or just incompetent. Because it&#039;s a solid show when it&#039;s doing things right; certain characters are well-developed and the production values can be great. However, when it comes to mecha action and time travel scenarios, this show falls flat on its face.<br />

    This anime comes off a little generic. That being sad it also brings in some new creative ideas that I have yet to see before in a mecha series. I like the anime mostly because of the characters. Where the story lacks the characters pick up pieces. The main character is a different kind of protagonist, hes not your typical I must defeat the enemy to avenge his family type of mecha protagonist. Which is a major plus because that is over played in this genre. <br />
The biggest negative is the story, I can&#039;t really tell if its going anywhere or if it is if

          <span style="display: none;" id="review137289">
        it will be good or not. But this does not take away from the overall enjoyment I&#039;m having while watching this.<br />
 If you want some mecha but nothing thats going to have you in tears then this is the anime for you.

    At first glance the Buddy Complex looks generic... but perhaps it&#039;s one of the reasons which makes it more enjoyable... <br />
<br />
From studio SUNRISE... that makes Gundam series... from time to time do an original mecha series like this... <br />
<br />
Buddy Complex plot and story is basically the basic fundamentals of mecha series... spaceships, mechas, war etc... However the story gets interesting when they include the &quot;time travel&quot; twist... ok I&#039;ll stop with that...  Like any other SUNRISE original mech series... Buddy Complex also borrows a lot of idea from Gundam franchise which is not bad if it&#039;s done correctly... it works fine on this one...<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204674">
        main story revolves on Aoba the aka mysterious pilot... it&#039;s about his journey upon a familiar yet different world his living... plus the two key characters for him are Dio and Hina... both have roles to play on how his journey ends... <br />
<br />
If I were to say that it&#039;s an all star seiyuu too even the supporting cast... the three main characters notable voices are: Kirito (SAO), Raku (Nisekoi) &amp; Yukino (Oregairu)... as for the supporting cast notable characters: Charlotte (I.S.), Yoko (Gurren Lagann), Gintoki (Gintama), Misaka (Toaru Majutsu), Madoka (Mahou Shoujo Madoka) etc... ooopsss Master Asia&#039;s seiyuu is also included...<br />
<br />
Overall I can&#039;t say anything bad on this series... because to be honest it&#039;s a really fun and enjoyable series to me... just give it a try...<br />
<br />
I almost forgot to mention that there are 2 OVA&#039;s which are episode 14 &amp; 15... it&#039;s a good closure to the story...

    Have you ever watched something that wasn&#039;t bad, but you just couldn&#039;t bring yourself to say it&#039;s good? <br />
<br />
That&#039;s the feeling of watching Buddy Complex.<br />
<br />
Buddy Complex is a mecha anime by Sunrise, the company behind Gundam and various other notable mecha animes such as VOTOMS, Layzner, and Code Geass. The main premise of this particular outing is that a mysterious girl named Hina takes a high schooler named Aoba to the future, where he becomes a pilot in a war. Basically an isekai-esque concept, except that rather than a fantasy world, the &quot;other world&quot; is simply a future version of the Earth.<br />
<br />
This piqued my interest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310430">
        in the series, as I&#039;d been looking for something that had an isekai-ish vibe and a sci-fi twist to it, and this seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I also figured that I might as will binge it before playing Super Robot Wars X, a crossover game that features the show&#039;s characters, story, mechs, etc.<br />
<br />
Now my experience with Sunrise&#039;s mecha releases in the 2010s is pretty limited to just a few Gundam releases, the VOTOMS OVAs, Valvrave, and Cross Ange. The latter two were glorious trainwrecks that managed to be extremely entertaining just because of how over the top and ridiculous they were. Given that example, I was expecting Buddy Complex to be similar, so exaggerated and dumb that I would be laughing the whole time at it&#039;s unintentional comedy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Buddy Complex wasn&#039;t that, rather it&#039;s just Sunrise Mecha™.<br />
<br />
What I mean by that, is that this show just feels like Sunrise just tossed as many of their tropes as possible into one show, and rather than using it to lovingly play with their established patterns, they simply played them all straight. I guarantee if you&#039;ve watched any Sunrise mecha show, you&#039;ll be familiar with any of the following elements:<br />
<br />
- An ordinary boy suddenly becomes a pilot and for some reason becomes an ace quickly (bonus points if their Mecha is white).<br />
- A wheelchair-bound little sister character<br />
- An episode where two characters from opposite factions are stuck on a deserted island together.<br />
- A mysterious female character turns the MC&#039;s life upside down.<br />
- A friendship/romance across faction lines.<br />
- A blonde character who serves as the MC&#039;s rival and/or partner.<br />
<br />
All of these are present in Buddy Complex and play out just about exactly how you&#039;d expect them to be, or in the worst case, are completely ignored and rendered irrelevant almost immediately after being introduced. I know that a company can&#039;t be completely original all the time after 40 years of producing works in a genre, but this just feels phoned in for the most part.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s not to say this anime is without it&#039;s merits. While it may be highly derivative of previous Sunrise works, the basic premise is interesting, albeit VERY underexplored. The soundtrack is solid, and the CGI work is some of the best I&#039;ve seen in any Mecha anime. The CGI sequences are at times almost indistinguishable from the drawn segments, making the action much more appealing to watch than it&#039;s contemporaries, such as Aldnoah.Zero, or Sunrise&#039;s later work, Cross Ange.<br />
<br />
The solid animation unfortunately does not help in that the designs themselves are rather bland. Our MC Aoba looks like Gundam ZZ&#039;s Judau if he&#039;d been redesigned to fit the general art style of early 2010s anime. The other characters all have fairly generic designs that wouldn&#039;t really stand out much next to other characters from the time. The mechs themselves suffer from being uninteresting, as they attempt to combine the bizarre and intricate designs of the Valvraves and Villkiss, with the sleek elegance  of Gundam Exia, and the medieval knightly motifs found in Code Geass&#039;s Knightmare Frames. The result are a bunch of machines who&#039;s names I can barely remember, and that look like they could easily just be generics in a cheap smartphone game.<br />
<br />
When comes down to it, Buddy Complex committs the worst crime a piece of media can - being totally average and unremarkable. Although ironically, it was so unremarkable that it made me want to go and write this whole review on it, so that&#039;s an achievement I guess? Whether it was because of my expectations for this to be a glorious trash fire or just the show being generally average, it left me disappointed. It&#039;s not a bad anime, but you&#039;d have a much more enjoyable experience watching almost any other mecha anime from Sunrise. My only hope now is that I enjoy it&#039;s scenarios in SRW X more than I enjoyed the actual show.<br />

    Story: 7/10<br />
Buddy Complex is a mecha anime from Sunrise that does not push any boundaries, unlike Valvrave. At the first battle scene you will think that is this really not a strange anime? <br />
<br />
&quot;Connect with Dio&quot;<br />
&quot;Acception&quot; <br />
<br />
What the heck??<br />
However, the story development is very well done. The battles display differing tactics after failed attempts rather than having the same few machines doing the same few moves against each other, which happens in quite a few of Sunrise&#039;s previous mecha series. It is a delight to see how our main characters get out of the various difficult situations they are forced into.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Coming from Sunrise, it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217979">
        is not much of a surprise that the art and sound are well done. The character are normal, but the art of Luxon and Bradyon is nice, and when both of them in coupling mode is so damn cool, like how the wings glow and all the cg effects stuff. But the 2 mecha still look like some No-grade Gundam. If Buddy Complex have more budget, the mecha will definitely look nicer with a bit of more detail. The battles scenes are amazing and do not have a noticeable amount of re-used scenes. It is a joy to watch for the art and sound alone.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I like both the opening and ending, except the ending somehow give me the feel of watching Gundam Seed ending(note: ending here isn&#039;t the final phase). Nevertheless, everything sounds right in this anime. The background music during the battles and while they are on standby fit in very well. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
All of the characters seem ordinary. However, they are easily likable and feel human enough not to feel two-dimensional. Also, when they get emotional, there are clear reasons behind them (i.e. their emotional spurts do not seem to be pulled out of nowhere). There are also no noticeable plot holes that I have noticed while casually watching the show. I like Hina a lot in this anime, her depicted character with her long black hair and purple eyes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
This is where the series shines for me. The anime does not become too ridiculous or too boring, and nothing about it bugs me. All the coupling scenes is good, I also enjoy how Aoba always talking about Hina as though Hina is his only one. But it&#039;s really enjoyable to see fast action mecha fight that is not one sided, even when it is, it will and must be overwhelming!<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.4/10<br />
Overall, this anime does not try to be anything out of the ordinary, but its excellent execution and animation bring this anime as one of the few good mecha anime.

    An astonishingly vapid and pedestrian mecha anime, which tries to score points with the yaoi fans, but boasts two males leads with all the chemistry of those two dead ducks served up &#039;side by side in death&#039;. One is mildly straitlaced, one is impulsive in the miserably predictable way that only bad shonen heroes can be, and all the two have in common is their unwavering desire to protect their friends. The single most ubiquitous trait among male protagonists of cheap action anime.<br />
<br />
The female lead is somewhat proactive, but nothing to write home about. Everyone else, we&#039;ve seen before done a lot better; the straitlaced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256538">
        female XO, the disabled imouto, the lazy but brilliant commander, the eccentric good scientist, suave evil scientist and of course, the bridge bunnies. All of these archetypes can be good, with development and backstory, but the complete absence of these ingredients is shocking. And then as for plot we have the pointlessly evil empire, superpowered mineral, arrogant supporting villains, missile massacres and search for a loved one, adding up to a dreary world of cardboard. Does the series get some points for a reasonably sensible time-travel plot? No, it gets no points, because SPOILER the loop relies on travellers being de-aged by time travel sometimes, but not other times, with any explanation.     <br />
<br />
To be fair, this thinness of plot lets the series get in about one solid aerial mecha battle per episode, which is probably what the writers were going for, and the reason that only the central three characters have any development; they&#039;re the only ones we need to care about for these battles to have significance. Essentially the rest of this cardboard world exists to get them into the cockpit. And the mecha battles are...kinetic, and competent, with decent music, but nothing to write home about. That really is the best that can be said for this series, and the worst is pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
One other good point is that most of the villains are developed about as well as the supporting good guys; the evil empire&#039;s rank and file really are ordinary soldiers fighting for their own motherland. In fact an anime about Commander Razan could have held much more interest...<br />
<br />
Finally, there was noise in some quarters that Slaine Troyard from mecha series Aldnoah.Zero was a copy of Bizon, from Buddy Complex. The character-types are similar, but while the former series spends half its runtime building sympathy for Count Troyard, Bizon&#039;s far more aggressive, brashly controlling, openly selfish and eventually psychotic prosecution of his feelings for Hina had no adequate justification at all (something to do with his mother?). Hence both in presentation and substance, one is a well-written anti-hero, the other a badly written villain, thank you and goodnight.   <br />

    I have to say that the series was pretty interesting. Besides the fact that it contains the usual mecha characteristics, it had a really intriguing and fairly original story line. Because Hina’s relationship with the main protagonist Aoba was kept from the viewers until the very end, it was necessary to complete the anime (including the 2 episode ONA) in order to have all the questions answered. Not only was the story line enjoyable, the action scenes were executed well. The animation was on point and fun to watch, and the character designs as well as the mech designs were well made. I enjoyed watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review278617">
        this anime, but I can’t say that it’s one of my favorites. It had elements that I liked very much, but some parts felt rushed. For example, I do wish the relationship between the main characters Aoba and Hina had been developed a little deeper. However, I do recommend watching this anime. It was enjoyable and I don’t regret watching all 13 episodes + the 2 episode ONA.

    I expected Buddy Complex to be just another Mecha that I watched for shameful enjoyment. It was, but it was also a bit more.<br />
Admittedly Buddy Complex is NOT going to change the face a Mecha, but it has some good characters and an interesting story-line. I watched through the whole series surprisingly quick.<br />
Now for the bad things.<br />
The ending to the anime (minus the special) is meh, and the special just MADE ME MAD! The pacing is really off at times and there are a fair number of unanswered (or poorly answered) questions.<br />
The art style is nothing amazing and the dialog is better if you are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215819">
        the type to dissect every line (otherwise it can be a bit flat at times).<br />
All that said, the series is definitely a fun and easy watch. The dynamic between Aoba and Dio by itself can keep you smiling.<br />
Buddy Complex - A fun watch that won&#039;t become a favorite, but isn&#039;t a waste of your time either.

    Gotta wonder what Sunrise has been up to lately. Below is an actual conversation between the writers.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hey, you know that Gundam show we made about Vampire Gundams and immortals? Let&#039;s do something even more stupid!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m listening...<br />
<br />
So you have these two dudes flying robots.<br />
<br />
Same robot?<br />
<br />
No, two robots, but they&#039;re going to propose, accept, and couple--because they&#039;re best buddies!<br />
<br />
Like gay sex?<br />
<br />
No, nothing like gay sex. One guy is the feisty one, the other is the brooding silent one. They don&#039;t get along at first, like when another cute buddy shows up, their coupling goes down, but when they fight with one another their coupling is super

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238539">
        awesome and lasts longer.<br />
<br />
...like gay sex.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with you?<br />
<br />
Can we make one of these... buddies a girl?<br />
<br />
Get the hell out of my office you sick pervert! Wait, no, we can make some backstory up about time travel and the girl is interested in one of the buddies, but it&#039;s not the same girl. And we can just recycle leftover scripts from Gundam Nacho Supreme Fartkontrol Omega Niner Extreme about how the super cool bad guys are chasing the buddies! You know, like every Gundam show we&#039;ve done since the 1980s. Don&#039;t worry, the audience won&#039;t notice.<br />
<br />
...I wonder if Production I.G is hiring?
