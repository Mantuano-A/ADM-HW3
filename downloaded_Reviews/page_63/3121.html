    Story<br />
Better than season 1, but still dismal.  I liked Yuki&#039;s post-traumatic stress behavior, which was the reason I gave this season a try.  It was a relief having her emotions at the forefront, instead of the previous season where she was constantly consoling the suicidal Zero.  I usually enjoy heroines in torment, but they didn&#039;t do much with it.  She continued obsessing over Zero and repeating the phrase, &quot;I cannot hurt Zero any more than this&quot; in her monotonous internal dialogues.  She also kept on chasing after Kaname, begging him to tell her about her past.  This dragged on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15907">
        WAY too long.  I can take only so many scenes of Yuki crying and pounding her fists against his chest while he goes, &quot;Yuuki,&quot; in his sad voice.  Unlike season 1, there was some buildup to the final events, the villain was decent, and there was some resolution.  However, the story was so boring and the characters&#039; behavior so repetitive that by the climax, I just didn&#039;t care.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art was similar to season 1.  Decent, nothing special.  I was disappointed but not surprised by the cheesiness of the monsters and the lameness of the fight scenes.  One treat was how cute Chairman Kaien was once he let down his hair and took off his glasses.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Another excellent soundtrack.  Just for the music, suffering through the two seasons was worthwhile.  I hate the intro, but the ending theme makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Yuki was unbearable.  She was as weak as ever, but much more intent on protecting everyone, even though she had ABSOLUTELY no capacity for doing so.  Watching her chase after the villain and put herself in danger was really irritating, especially because she endangered a lot of Kaname&#039;s lackeys in the process.  Kaname did improve somewhat; he was less opaque and we finally understood his attachment to Yuki.  Zero and Ichirou also gained some depth.  The twins may have been the most powerful, compelling plot element in the entire show.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
They shouldn&#039;t have raised our expectations that Yuki would become strong if they weren&#039;t going to deliver.  They did nothing with her being the guardian.  If the main focus was the love triangle, then they should have put WAY more attention on developing the two relationships.  Yuki spent a lot of time with Kaname and Zero, but she didn&#039;t connect with Kaname until the end, and her scenes with Zero were just angsty melodrama.  I can&#039;t remember a single romantic scene in either season that I would rewatch, and I&#039;m usually pretty enthusiastic about corny shoujo moments.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I&#039;m truly shocked by this show&#039;s popularity.

    First and foremost, I write from the perspective of a dissatisfied audience of Vampire Knight Guilty. It was due to my positive opinion of Vampire Knight that led to me to Vampire Knight Guilty and hence my judgement cannot make dichotomies of the two (so I hope you don&#039;t mind me making reference to Vampire Knight).<br />
<br />
As you&#039;ll probably know, VKG continues right where VK left off, retaining much of VK&#039;s good qualities at first. The characters from VK/VKG are very well-built and generally three-dimensional enough for me as an audience to relate to and hence enjoy, with the exception of Kaname-kun, who was so perfect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12688">
        in his prestige, power and popularity that there was no room for him to be anything but an admirable and incomprehensible figure.<br />
<br />
The artwork itself was generally quite well-done, although I felt the quality didn&#039;t follow through towards the end of VKG. In terms of sound, nothing stood out as being special but nevertheless, it complimented the plot and character developments.<br />
<br />
The one thing that I really want to talk about is the storyline. The reason why VK was excellent in my opinion was its plot. The flow of the story introduces audience to a very different and intriguing world of vampires, and as you journey through the plot progression, mysteries of the world and its creatures unravels itself through introduction of new characters, philosophies and events, that spices up and quenches curiosity of the world whilst requiting the audience a greater interest in knowledge of vampires and their existence.<br />
<br />
And so VKG begins with this highly anticipated and built-up plot where most branches of side and main plots from VK was left wide open. However, as the story progresses in VKG, the pace of the story really dies down. Excluding a few snippets of fair back stories to some of the supporting characters, the main plot really felt mundane and hard to trudge through. <br />
<br />
Due to an overly pretentious overemphasis on subtle foreshadowing, the climax of VKG comes about in a very poor, but surprising way, which in its own was interesting. VKG was on a road to revival, bringing back the essences that made its preceder a success. Inevitably, due to lack of pacing in the story, VKG ran out of time to wrap up properly, failing to arrive at the respectable conclusion that VKG&#039;s climax opened up for. In all honesty, the conclusion simply felt rushed, as if the writers just ran out of time and whipped up a mediocre ending and forgot about all these other things.<br />
<br />
Having enjoyed VK, it really was a pity that VKG did not follow through. VK felt like it created so much potential for VKG, who grabbed a single point of interest and neglected the rest of VK&#039;s successful elements. To sum VKG up, it centralises on one element of a good script, then patched a drawn-out and repetitive build up to its front and a short and undermined continuity to its back. <br />
<br />
It was not bad, but the fact that it was a mere shadow of its former annoys me, and so I give it a 6/10 (it&#039;s simply my opinion). <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if you have seen VK, watch VKG with an open mind. (I don&#039;t take into account that I wasn&#039;t in it for a fanciful, mystical tale about pretty boys, which was part of what VK/VKG was marketed to be.)

    Note: Vampire Knight Guilty is a direct continuation of Vampire Knight more so than a sequel, so it is necessary to watch Vampire Knight first to truly understand Vampire Knight Guilty.  This review is only based on Vampire Knight Guilty.<br />
<br />
Story:  Vampire Knight Guilty is very much a traditional shoujo series about forbidden love.  However, through the inclusion of vampires, the series takes on a bit more of a gothic feel which is heavily relied on to hold the viewer&#039;s interest.  The story is mainly told from the point of view from the female protagonist, Yuuki, and her inner turmoil about her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9774">
        past and her feelings about the two male main characters, a vampire Kaname and a vampire hunter Zero, are the main driving forces behind the story.  The story is also sometimes told from a third-person perspective, allowing the viewer to know details that Yuuki does not.  While the story in itself is quite good and probably one of the best gothic romance animes out there, due to the switching of perspectives, the plot pacing can sometimes feel excruciatingly slow and often very repetitive.  Yuuki continuously tries to tackle the same issues internally episode after episode to the point where it becomes very redundant; the actual story moves along much better when it is not dwelling on Yuuki&#039;s thoughts.   This also creates a conflict in the main point of the story, since it sometimes emphasizes the mystery shrouding Yuuki and the other main characters and other times seems to try to hold the viewer solely by building up (almost uneccessary) romantic tension to keep the viewer watching to see which character Yuuki will end up with.<br />
<br />
Short version: The story is conflicted in a way that it sometimes tries to be a mystery/suspense anime and other times simply a gothic shoujo/romance.  7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Art:  The main character designs are lovely for shoujo and done very well&#039; some character features are a bit too over-exaggerated (Yuuki&#039;s eyes being one example), but this kind of character design is fairly normal for the shoujo genre. The background is also illustrated nicely and gives off a bit of an eerie feeling to lend to the gothic mood the anime is trying to create.  However, sometimes there are inconsistencies in the animation, many still frames, and skimping out on the details of background characters.  For the most part, this can be overlooked because the actual art direction is done very well, showing the right images at the right times.  Someone with a scruitinizing eye will definitely pick up on the flaws, but a casual viewer probably won&#039;t.  One flaw of sorts that almost any viewer would immediately pick out is the rather boring ending sequence that looks like it was thrown together in five minutes.<br />
<br />
Short version: Nice shoujo character designs and animation, but definitely not the best out there.  7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:  This is where Vampire Knight Guilty excels.  Although the opening song is nice, but nothing to rave over, the ending song by Wakeshima Kanon is excellent and really gives the series an extra nudge into the gothic genre.  The sound effects are also nicely done, as well as the background music which also gives the anime a rather eerie feeling, reminding you that you are watching something a bit darker than your average shoujo romance.  The voice acting overall is great, but it is Miyano Mamoru (Best Actor in the Seiyuu Awards of 2008 for Setsuna from Gundam 00) that really does an outstanding job by voicing two charcters, twins, and giving them their own distinct nuances.  Really excellent work.  8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: The main characters are all round, very well-developed characters for a shoujo romance, although their development is done in a way that negatively impacts the pacing.  The anime almost forces you into their heads to experience thr emotions of certain characters, particularly in Yuuki&#039;s case, while leavin other characters in an air of mystery.  You wouldn&#039;t be able to miss an instant of what Yuuki&#039;s thoughts and emotions are even if you tried.  On the other hand, not everything is given to you on a silver platter, other characters remain much more mysterious and it is up to the viewer to try to unravel the mystery behind those characters themselves.  It&#039;s a very stark contrast, but it works very well for the series.  8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  If you are looking for a shoujo anime overflowing with romance, this show will definitely hook you.  It is filled with forbidden love, love-triangles, anguish, angst, unrequited love... just about any element you can think of that fits into the genre.  However it is unique in its dark atmosphere.  If you are looking for a shoujo anime and like the added bonus of a gothic edge and a bit of mystery, this is definitely the show to watch and would get a 10/10 in that regard.  On the other hand, if you are looking for something that is more solely along the lines of suspense or supernatural  without all the angsty romantic flare, give this one a pass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:  An enjoyable, well-animated and produced show that definitely stands out in the shoujo genre as something a bit more unique than others.  The added gothic edge and use of mystery will hook the lovers of the shoujo genre even more and probably pick up other casual viewers as well, since overall the show is better than your run-of-the-mill anime love story.  7.5/10   But, if you aren&#039;t a fan of the shoujo genre in the slightest and not interested in romance animes, you will want to give this one a pass.  Although the show does contain a bit of mystery, suspense, and vampires, the main emphasis is undoubtedly romance, and there is no way to disregard that shoujo romantic factor in this anime to just enjoy it for the mystery and suspense it contains.

    *SPOILER WARNING*<br />
What started out as a very good continuation of season one, and loyal companion to the manga (which I am sad to say, I did not know, too the exact same turn as transcribed here) ended up being a major disappointment in the way of a Shoujo anime. I don&#039;t normally affiliate with the genre, and this series reminded me why. The abrupt ending of Zero&#039;s affection for Yuuki given the circumstances involving her having been a pure blood vampire this entire time was nothing short of a kick in the teeth. To watch 26 full episodes of them going back and forth with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15339">
        each other in one of the most twisted and abusive love triangles I have ever seen, only to find in the end because Yuuki was never who Zero thought she was he can no longer love her?<br />
Admittedly there is some bias to my words. I preferred Zero over Kaname only because the latter of the two was a self absorbed prick who&#039;s soul intent was roughly the same as Zero&#039;s later on in the series. I don&#039;t really feel that the story for both the manga and the anime were all that in depth as so many things could have been done to prevent the overall conclusion, everything just seemed to happen because one vampire wanted to be strong. For some reason, however, no one ever thought to band up and kill him all at the same time? And why exactly did he need to drink Yuuki&#039;s blood?<br />
Overall, a very bad series that sadly had great potential.

    If you enjoyed Vampire Knight, you&#039;ll enjoy Vampire Knight Guilty. Mostly because it is the continuation of Vampire Knight, but also because it&#039;s more developed than Vampire Knight and contains a better story. It&#039;s not that I didn&#039;t like the story to Vampire Knight, but that I like the story to Vampire Knight Guilty better. <br />
<br />
Story: You know, the story here it&#039;s good. And I have told you that I liked the VKG (Vampire Knight Guilty) better than VK (Vampire Knight) It&#039;s, I find, very well thought-out. Like any other anime that is based on a manga, it follows the manga, though not always the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9844">
        same. (It is in this case, but anyways.) The main subject really is about a love that can&#039;t happen; in this case between humans and vampires, friend and friend&#039;s enemy. Well, really, it&#039;s Zero and Yuuki, or Yuuki and Kaname, as the way I see it. It doesn&#039;t drag on like some of the animes I&#039;ve watched, which usually makes the viewer get bored of the series and looses interest in the anime/manga. That has happened to me millions of times, but because this one gets to the point, or, just a lot of things happen in just a short while, and everytime we get to a better and better plot. That is one of the things you&#039;ll definitely like about VKG.<br />
<br />
Art: I find the guys have a bit of a feminine feature to them; particularly their eyes, which are basically just a smaller version of a female&#039;s, and the small curve when they wear their uniforms. Their faces are very.. pointy, may I say, at the end and actually just gives me a feminine vibe. Their hair is usually long, though some of them are shorter but is long, like most of manga guys. Most, not all, because some of them actually have short hair, like Naruto. But in this case, Zero, Kaname, Shiki, Ichijou, and a lot of other people have longer hair than usual. I find the eyes to the girls, which are what I find an enlarged version of the males&#039;, are a bit haunting. They have that weird impression, and it gives you the feeling that there really are vampires in this world. It just suits the main subject of this story; vampires. <br />
<br />
Sound: It&#039;s good, I guess. I&#039;m not one to judge about sound; but I find the openings and endings do fit the series, however. Also about the voices, it&#039;s okay. I don&#039;t really care about the voices, as long as they actually make sense, but I doubt someone will make an anime with voices that don&#039;t make sense.<br />
<br />
Character: This is where I&#039;ll rant. I don&#039;t like Yuuki&#039;s character. She&#039;s too innocent. And every guy seems to just want to flirt with her or something. Kaname loves her, in some way, and Zero; and if you notice, in one point of the story, Hanabusa is quite the flirt, too. It just seems that it&#039;s unfair to the other girls in the Night Class, plus the Day Class students. (But I don&#039;t really care about the Day Class students because they aren&#039;t REALLY critical to the story,) I&#039;m not saying that they all love her the way Kaname and Zero like her, but everyone in the Night Class, males I mean, have a particular liking to her. They either want something to do with her, or regularly talk to her. Like, I&#039;m not saying Akatsuki Kain wants to get married with her. I&#039;m just saying that they have a particular liking to her. I&#039;m glad Shiki isn&#039;t really, or actually not at all, having a liking to Yuuki. The girls in the Night Class are pretty well-made, too. Rima&#039;s character is my particular favourite, since she&#039;s mysterious and she&#039;s cute at the same time. Ruka is a strong girl, I know it, even though I dislike her... but only a bit.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoy everything I see, really. If I don&#039;t like it, I&#039;m not really going to watch it. That&#039;s the kind of person I am. Don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t care about it. I&#039;m not going to review, or something else.<br />
Other than that, I enjoy watching this anime &#039;cause it keeps catching my attention. It doesn&#039;t drag on, like I have said before, and keeps my interest in place.<br />
<br />
Overall: Yeah, it&#039;s great.

    I was so excited when I learned they had made a second season but was greatly disappointed when I watched it. It varies from the manga too far. They fail to introduce an important character, that triggers a major scene with Yuki having to finally confront her feelings.<br />
Plus if you were looking forward to the big battle with the big bad uncle, prepare yourself, it bit! It was over in 2.5 seconds and Kaname is the major player instead of Yuki! It was total garbage and I wish they had just waited for the manga so the full 13 episodes could have been exact. Course

    NOTE: I have not read the manga so my view on this anime may differ slighlty from those who have.<br />

Vampire knight guilty is a continuation of the original series Vampire Knight. The series is set in a school that caters to both vampires and humans that are separated into the night and day classes respectively. The story revolves around a girl whose first memories she can remember is being attacked by a vampire and being saved by a pureblood vampire which is the highest rank. She starts to harbour feelings for both her good friend and vampire hunter Zero as well as the pureblood who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11475">
        saved her which is currently in the school.<br />
<br />
I think the story was quite original from the usual vampires and stuff. Incorporating the shuojo genre very well. That is probably the main genre of ths series. Coupled with a bit of action here and there, suspense, drama and mystery to create a fairly good series. There are good twists in the show and the story is not so cliche in terms of the relationships between characters. However, the show can be rather dark at times, so if you prefer something more lightheated,comedic than prehaps this won&#039;t be the best choice of anime for you. Plot wise it may be a bit cliche, and don&#039;t expect heavy suspense or drama.<br />
<br />
The art incorporates the typical shuojo style of drawing characters with big eyes and bishiounen(pretty boys). not necessarily the best i&#039;ve seen but still of a decent quality.The background is mostly dull to help enhance the dark theme in tisi show. <br />
<br />
The voice actors did a good job. Each voice fitting the characters perfectly. The OP and ED songs contribute to the gothic theme of the show. background music now and then also helps to enhance the atmosphere. But yet again, i would not say it was top-notch, there are better animes than this in the sound department.<br />
<br />
The characters was what i was quite impressed in. Because they actually managed to cover a wide range of characters in the short span of 13 episodes. Of course some getting more depth and coverage than others but still the depth of each character can be seen clearly.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the series as a romance fan though i think the ending was not to my liking. Some of you will probably be disappointed with the ending as well so be prepared.This series is definitely better than the first. Having more action, more interaction between characters and more twists. I would say it is the best vampire-romance anime i have seen. So those of you who are considering whether the secod season is worth watching, i&#039;d say give it a shot.

    Usually 2nd season is worse than the 1st one. However, this does not apply to Vampire Knight Guilty. Almost in every category VKG was better than VK. The only thing I liked more in 1st season was OST. Music was good in VKG too, but not as fitting the mood of the story as the VK one.<br />
<br />
What was 1st season lacking the most, was not enough character introduction in my opinion. I was rather disappointed that only Zero&#039;s past was showed and explained while Kaname&#039;s and Yuuki&#039;s was left unknown. After watching VKG I can understand why didn&#039;t show their past in VK. It does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101151">
        make sense and it was a good decision.  <br />
<br />
So yeah, we finally got to see their pasts, which also lead to see some better character development as well. If Yuuki was rather annoying and useless in VK, then in VKG she changed almost completely. At the beginning she still wasn&#039;t very contributing and as always Zero, Kaname or other Vampires had to take care of her, but she start to grow as a character in my eyes. Of course, that sudden event changed a lot, but she was already getting stronger before it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I wasn&#039;t really expecting to see Kaname&#039;s true colors, but surprisingly we did get to see that. I thought he will be used as a mysterious character till the end, but here we got his past, we know why he&#039;s so caring about Yuuki and what are his future plans. I believe it was really well done, good timing I mean to do it. It was definitely shocking... I found his past even more harsh than what Zero had. No wonder Kaname was always so distant from everyone.<br />
<br />
Vampire Knight Guilty in my eyes were already better when introduced antagonist early in the show instead of at last episodes like in VK. Although I wish he had more screen time. He did get more than enough screen time in the flashbacks, but a bit disappointing how short we got to see him in action during the current time. Yet, I am not really complaining about this as usually fights that take long are just irritating... I am not really fond of shows who drag fights, so I was rather happy how everything happened in VKG.<br />
<br />
As I have already mentioned, the music wasn&#039;t as good as in Vampire Knight. However, I am not gonna lie, it was still very good. I gave 9/10 and only not a 10, because I know that it could have been better (VK as example). The whole OST was playing the right mood that characters of the series contained, so that was a great addition to the series.<br />
<br />
To sum up, the VKG has definitely exceeded my expectations. I can honestly say that it&#039;s the first shoujo anime to me that was able to include some mystery and supernatural genre&#039;s very well. Another great thing about this anime is that it was unpredictable. Till the very end wasn&#039;t sure who will Yuuki choose if she will choose that is.<br />

Whether it was helpful or not, please do not hesitate and give me feedback ^^ I do want to improve writing reviews. Thank you for reading!

Vampire Knight Guilty is a continuation of the anime Vampire Knight, and that is all it is. It is not its own series, and it is rather unwatchable without watching the primary series.<br />
As for the anime itself, it is absolutely one of the superior ones out there. The plot is exceptional and it has an inimitable outlook on vampires. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger making you fancy to gaze at the next one in the series without delay. Although there is awfully minute action, the drama is what keeps you going, so if you want an adventure shounen where the main

    I really got into this anime, loved the characters and the world created, but all hopes and dreams smashed with the ending! I don&#039;t need a happy skipping into the sunset ending, but after seeing this anime I was not only disappointed but scratching my head (spoiler: A school for human vampire coexistence, but neither interacts with the other nor even knows they are vampires, AND Zero goes through this whole experience just to decide to kill all the vampires???). <br />
<br />
My hope is that the love story is completely dropped (even though the scythe weapon of Yuki&#039;s is really cool) and Zero gets his own

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13842">
        anime and manga, because the Bloody Rose gun is an awesome weapon and he&#039;s got a great background for his future of hunting down vampires.  I wish that this anime was only included as flashbacks for Zero the Vampire Hunter and not an anime all by itself.

    I began watching the first season, and didn&#039;t think the story was very good in the first place--I never really knew what was going on, and overall it kinda sucked. But that is nothing compared to the second season, Vampire Knight Guilty.<br />
<br />
I must say, I expected this to get better, but it actually got appallingly worse. I tried to be fair with it, but when I look at it overall, it was just awful. The story barely made sense, the characters didn&#039;t have any development, and even if they did, it was really difficult to notice. It seems the creators got lost in trying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182998">
        create something ambiguous, and &#039;cool&#039; and misplaced the actual plot.<br />
<br />
All of the minor characters seemed to want bigger parts, but, (for some reason) couldn&#039;t seem to &#039;budge their way in&#039; going by the strange relationship with Yuki, Kaname, and Zero taking up a lot of the confusing screen time, and ended up getting written off. Multiple random things happened this season, including a kind of &#039;boss vampire&#039; who barely fit in with the plot either, brought to you by one of the minor characters who can&#039;t seem the squeeze their way into the story whatsoever. All in all, there was no reason for the minor characters--the setup would&#039;ve been more plausible if the &#039;boss vampire&#039; came out from under the love-triangle and Kaname and Zero just punched it and went back to bickering. <br />
<br />
I say, if you wanna watch this anime for a laugh, by all means--I did. But don&#039;t watch the second season. The ending was disappointing and, frankly, tortuous. It&#039;s a wonder I got through it at all.

    Having recovered from the injuries he had sustained, Zero returns to Cross Academy to resume his role as prefect. Though, not long after he resumes his role, members of the Supreme Vampire Council ambush Zero with the intent to execute him for the murder of the pureblood, Shizuka. Luckily when Kaname intervenes, he sends the council away and insists that they stay out of school affairs. However, whilst Kaname continues to hide the truth about Shizuka&#039;s death, there are others who grow suspicious of what happened that night and what the dorm president is hiding. Meanwhile, Yuuki begins to have flashbacks, leading her to investigate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review67675">
        her blood-stained past: what will she find, and will she continue to be tempted by an offer from Kaname?<br />
<br />
Now on to the review and I hope you and enjoy reading this review and I hope it helps you&#039;s in anyway. Aha, late to the party I know. Anyways, lets get started:<br />
<br />
Story (7/10) <br />
Built upon a sturdy foundation of shoujo clichés and pretty animation, Vampire Knight Guilty is a lot of fun without being particularly elegant. Moreover, as the second instalment in a successful dark shoujo series, it brings the story of mysterious vampires and tragic love to an agreeable conclusion.<br />
<br />
For most, VKG’s main attraction will always be its contrivances, clichés, and ham-handed delivery of the romance. Consider the corniest scene involving vampires possible (OMG he licked her neck! *squeal*), then set it to repeat across several episodes. Throw in hints of homoeroticism for extra tang and some half-baked lore, and VKG gives the impression that it’s not so much animated as churned. Indeed, the series makes no claim to originality or wit, but it manages its cheese surprisingly well, and, on balance, turns out to be more interesting than irksome.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, buried amongst all the silly love triangle stuff, there’s still that core of well-executed mystery keeping the story afloat. Crucially, VKG knits together much of the political threads left hanging by the first season: after lurking in the shadows so long, the Vampire Council finally takes centre stage, as does a newly kick-arse Headmaster Cross, and Kaname’s true intentions become clear in a gasp-worthy twist.<br />
<br />
One true disappointment, however, is that, despite wishing to portray a violent clash between the various factions, VKG’s battles look and feel anything but. The static sequences are usually over before they’ve begun, and attempts at spicing things up with flashy gimmicks just look forced. Even the finale can’t escape this flat-lining of tension as everything generally happens too fast and too easily.<br />
<br />
As a final note, ardent fans of the manga should brace themselves for a slight but significant reinterpretation of Zero at the end. No doubt, it will send a few spitting in rage.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
Like Vampire Knight, VKG looks very pretty, with lush colours and attractive character designs perfectly catered towards the shoujo lovers. Regrettably, it also adopts VK’s disregard for movement. While VK is predominantly drama-based, VKG relies on fighting sequences during some of its climactic moments; the insufficient number of frames, straightforward camera angles, and uninventive choreography, therefore, only lessen their impact.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10)<br />
The cheap pop opening and closing themes add nothing to VKG’s charm. The score, on the other hand, though mostly generic (aimless tinkering on a piano, queer string instrumentals, that kind of thing), still holds one or two surprises. The most useful additions include the sound effects subtly used to heighten the spooky ambience; for example, the sudden rush of cymbals during particularly tense exchanges goes a little way to enrich the viewing experience.<br />
<br />
Characters (6/10)<br />
With fewer comedic scenes to add colour to Yuuki’s personality, the effects of her clueless vulnerability and passive nature leap from uninspiring to outright disgusting. Taking the initiative and driving the story on her own merits is certainly beyond her as she stutters and sighs her way through every conversation. Most irritatingly, she’s the kind of contradictory character who speaks of saving others whilst constantly needing protection herself.<br />
<br />
As such, providing entertainment falls to Kaname and Zero. While Kaname wields his mysteriousness like an expert by throwing a dark and truly unexpected spanner in the works, Zero escalates his catalogue moping (seemingly, just because he can). Neither ventures from his archetypal pigeon hole, but both remain engaging, nonetheless, because of their anguished backgrounds.<br />
<br />
The other good news is that Kaname’s previously nameless hangers-on get fleshed out and become more relevant to the plot. In particular, I find the exploration of Aidou’s friendship with Kaname to be an interesting addition to the character development.<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
VKG will prove the perfect fix for fans addicted to a sugary diet of bishies, immature angst, and romanticised horror themes; competent central mystery aside, those elements are its forte. For anyone looking for substance and/or action, however, the show will leave a distinct ‘Is that it?’ feeling as anticlimactic fight scenes and an insipid cast dog the plot. On the whole, VKG may not feel as fresh and exciting as its predecessor, but it remains at all times a fun and easy romp to follow.

    to describe this season in 1 word it would be, disapointing,<br />
<br />
 what really made the first season work for me was it had some amazing suspense, great cliffhangers and had a lot of twists, and even for how steriotypicaly emo zero was they handles him very well and he came off like a selfless teen that was willing to let him suffer and even die a slow painful death if he had to, to save yuuki or his father and even just people in general, and his hatred for vampires and yet him being one realy built up his charecter, why am i mentioning this,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37712">
        well i mentioning it cause zero is hardly even in the second season, and heres where the show starts to take a sudden downturn<br />
<br />
this seaosn focused very much on kaname and yuuki, and befor ei go off i have to mention this, this show has the absoulte WORST TWIST EVER, you wont see it coming but when they reveal what it is and what they continue to do after words is just WTF worthy, but back on topic the show focuses much more kaname and yuuki, now this would of been the chance to make kaname more likable caus ein the first serise he is a total asshole that steals the spotlight and acts very high and mighty, basicly hes a asshole and the first time i saw guilty i though he was the villian cause they make him much much worse, he does some dasterdly things and he just come soff as evil till the very end and even then he still seems like he&#039;d fuck over everyone for his own goal, which is protecting yuuki but his logic is &quot;ill kill everything but yuuki&quot; so yah kaname may have somehow become even more worse, yuuki isnt any different from the first serise at all<br />
<br />
and heres the biggets problem with guilty, theres no suspense, every build up leads to a let-down, a cop out, or they just drop the plot point all together, they build up this one villian who lasts about 20 seconds of fighting, i wish i were kidding, the show just doesnt have any good cliffhangers either and for a lack of a better word its just boring, not to sound like a fanboy/girl but when zeor comes in the show does get better, mainly cause some very emotional things happen and you want this guy to get what he wants but he has everyone int he world agianst him, ide say if it werent for scenes of zero and his brother the sow would have been a 4, <br />
<br />
the actual ending does leave not really a cliffhanger but leaves alot of things open for the inevitable season 3, its a good ending and i want to see what happens next the ending fight is a letdown but the actual ending while not satisfying will leave you wondering what happens next, the next season really needs to work on making yuuki less of a idiot, make kaname stop doing worse things the actual villians do then season 3 wil lbe good. fingers crosse dit will work out<br />
<br />
also before i leave i just have to comment on how dated and lazy this shows animaiton is, it seriously looks like its from 2003, whenever animaiton gets good it lasts for about 4 seconds then back to outdated animation, they need to fix that aswell

    Vampire Knight: Guilty is the sequel of Vampire Knight.<br />
<br />
Somehow the story focuses more on Yuki and Kaname&#039;s past and how Zero struggles into turning a Level-E vampire. Yuki finally becomes a vampire and it is reveal that Kaname and Yuki are siblings.Rido Kuran shows up in this story and is the main antagonist for this season.<br />
<br />
Somehow the art is Amazing as ever! You can feel the not-so-typical shoujo atmosphere in it. And somehow, The art reminds me of Uragiri wa Boku no Namae wo Shitteiru. Yuki becomes more mature and you can see her resemblance to her beautiful mother Juri.<br />
<br />
The story left as a cliffhanger

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64841">
        in the end and I totally don&#039;t like it that much...If you don&#039;t like the ending I recommend you to read manga for better unerstanding!<br />
<br />
The characters didn&#039;t annoy me at all in fact all of them are useful and has roles to play. I love the fight between Ruka and Aido cause It somehow provides the comedic enjoyment of this story.<br />
<br />
Overall I give Seven (7) for this anime, cause it didn&#039;t satisfy me at all. I recommend people to read the manga for better knowledge.

    I ask you not to read this review if you have not seen the whole anime. Understand? Understood.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, then, Holy Mary, this anime has been a pile of cheap psychological rubbish. Let&#039;s start with Yuuki who always finds a way to faint and to apologize every time. Seriously, this girl is not repetitive, it&#039;s a broken record. I realized that Yuuki has to do stupid things so that she can be more submissive than the two guys who want her for them. This girl is a lost case and I am sorry to have to say it but she cannot understand that Kaname knows more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312719">
        about the devil and every time she tries to rebel against that fool, then she comes out with a: &quot;I&#039;m sorry, Kaname-sama!&quot;<br />
I mean, come on! But how can you make a female character so bad? Let&#039;s not talk about the fact that Zero becomes Kaname&#039;s bitch. You have a serious character like Zero, a vampire hunter who is cool like no other, yet for some reason ends up depending on Kaname. Zero literally becomes another pawn in the large chessboard of that incestuous vampire. In just one season, Zero&#039;s dignity disappears.<br />
Kaname is Yuuki&#039;s brother.<br />
A moment of silence. Hands up who would never have expected it. Did you raise your hand? You lied. You lied and you know it.<br />
Kaname is Yuuki&#039;s older brother and wants to marry her so that he has a vampire offspring that has pure blood. Damn! Yuuki really had a difficult choice to make (sarcasm). After she was vampirised, she had to choose whether to have a story with Zero, the guy with whom she grew a healthy romantic relationship, or to have a story with Kaname, her older brother who manipulated her for two whole seasons. Tough choice, huh?<br />
In the end, Vampire Knight is simply a mediocre anime on vampires.

    Vampire Knight : Guilty is one of those series that makes me want to stop watching deep animes and stick to silly romance animes where the ending is always happy. The first season was awesome, but the part 2 was a let down.<br />
<br />
[spoilers]<br />
What is the point for the ending? The ENTIRE series revolved around a certain goal. The school, the teachers, the bonds, the story itself had the same goal. Yet with the ending given, It completely makes no sense. 10 hours of episodes spent focusing on one goal, co-existence amongst all groups, yet zero&#039;s actions at the end doesn&#039;t do anything for that goal.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review20561">
        entire series filled me with a sense of suspense and anticipation on what was to come. Could have been rated really high, but IMO the ending destroyed EVERYTHING that the series worked for.

    Allow me to begin by admitting that I thoroughly enjoyed Vampire Knight Guilty and its predecessor. In admitting this, I am also saying that my rating is incredibly biased. <br />
<br />
I was on the hedge when it came to Vampire Knight Guilty, more so than I was with the original series. Most of us can agree that sequels rarely live up to the original. In many cases, the original series is meant to establish characters, relations, and a foundation for the overarching plot. Sequels, then, are supposed to consist of the meat of the story. They are supposed to clear up all issues, ties up loose

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52015">
        ends, and leave the viewer satisfied at the end of the day. Unfortunately, this concept isn&#039;t always followed. Instead, a number of sequels are made to continue sucking revenue out of an already popular show. <br />
<br />
This leads to that annoying filler we all know and hate. In series that air extensively, the filler can sometimes last entire arcs, for the dual purposes of lining pockets with greenbacks and to continue an anime with an on-going manga counterpart. <br />
<br />
But this isn&#039;t new to many of us. We know and loathe the process, as it turns otherwise great shows into absolute travesties that we wish to never have experienced. <br />
<br />
Vampire Knight Guilty, however, is one of those rare successes in a sea of failure. While there are elements of the plot that became... tedious to deal with, the developments were rather satisfying, and the intrigue hinted at in the original came to fruition. This installment was not perfect. It had its fair share of flaws, and some might express malcontent with the ending.<br />
<br />
I have read the other reviews here, and quite a few seem to hate the ending without the possibility of reconciliation. I personally enjoyed the twists presented, though the pacing was a bit odd. Vampire Knight Guilty deserved to be a longer series. Crammed into thirteen episodes, the viewer is given a steady plot progression over the first nine and then a race to the finish line for the last four. The final episode, though, did leave me satisfied. I can ignore a rushed end game if the actual ending is nice enough. <br />
<br />
However, I recognize that not everyone will appreciate the decisions made as I have. The best way to describe it without giving it away is to say that the end ties up all of the loose ends of the main character&#039;s relationships. Unlike some romance anime, Vampire Knight Guilty does not end with a wishy-washy &quot;let&#039;s all get along and love her equally&quot; type deal. Instead, it caters to both consummated and unrequited love. There are a few elements that some viewers may find tasteless, but that is a matter of perspective. The way those elements are presented in the anime make sense, and as such I can accept them. <br />
<br />
There is a lack of catharsis, though, which may shock some of the viewers. I know that I was expecting a little tragedy to hit somewhere near the end. With all of the build-up, I was almost hoping for some death and despair. Even so, I can&#039;t say that I am dissatisfied with how events turned out.<br />
<br />
Now, die-hard fans of the manga will be quick to note that Vampire Knight Guilty does not live up to its counterpart, but I cannot personally vouch for that. Having never read the manga, my experience is limited solely to the anime. I can say that the manga is on-going, and the anime was created years ago. At the very least, I expect the manga to be paced more evenly, and to explain several of the developments that were only haphazardly touched upon. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I can only say that I enjoyed Vampire Knight Guilty more than its predecessor. While I did enjoy the introductions of the characters, the ending of Vampire Knight Guilty won me over. The art and sound quality is the same in both, though I must note that the ending theme for Vampire Knight Guilty is one of my favorite EDs. It&#039;s one of the few that I was willing to listen to more than once as opposed to skipping right over it. <br />
<br />
I will say that if you watched Vampire Knight, you should watch Vampire Knight Guilty. Even if you wind up hating the ending, I cannot see how anyone can be satisfied with the state of affairs as they were left off in the original. If you did not enjoy Vampire Knight, however, you should stray away from Vampire Knight Guilty. It&#039;s in the same vein of entertainment, after all.

    So, the second part of Vampire Knight.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
So, here now is where we slowly progress off of what happened last while Yuki in season 2 is desperate to know about her past and it slowly builds up between her and a main battle which happens later. Also some other things are discovered too. I enjoyed the second part of the story between.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
<br />
The art didn&#039;t change obviously so I still enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
<br />
More music was added and sound effects which made the anime between. So, the anime wasn&#039;t repetitive which if it was I think that would&#039;ve kept the viewer bored. <br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
<br />
The characters improved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227830">
        compared to season one. Yuki is not so obsessed with Kaname and is more focused on her past with help but eventually does discover it with help.<br />
<br />
Zero is slowly building up to becoming a level e but still does have help to try to keep his humanity which is still slipping though. More hatred for vampires starts to appear because of Yuki&#039;s past with Kaname.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the story again but wasn&#039;t too big on the ending and feel like it could have ended better than it did. <br />
<br />
Overall I give this season 8/10.<br />

    Be forewarned, spoilers ahead.<br />
<br />
I was wary of watching VK when I&#039;d first heard of it. The vampire genre is often riddled with cliches and bad writing, especially concerning the teenage demographic where, in most cases, is just a bodice ripper. But I&#039;m willing to give anything a shot. <br />
<br />
I started out liking VK, but when I got to VKG that started to change. The love triangle that started out as being unpredictable soon became blatantly obvious. The unexpected twist of Yuuki not only being a vampire who hadn&#039;t &quot;awakened&quot; yet, but was also was related to Kaname completely ruined it for me. It&#039;s like they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98599">
        exchanged taboos - the forbidden vampire/human love becomes the forbidden vampire incest love. Like somehow it wouldn&#039;t be appealing if there weren&#039;t some sort of taboo involved. <br />
<br />
Zero&#039;s reaction to Yuuki&#039;s unknown secret also got to me. His reaction seemed more convenient than anything else; if he no longer loves her, then she and Kaname can go and live happily ever after. Whoopee.<br />
<br />
Given the first season where Yuuki is constantly in need of saving, I was hoping that the &quot;plot twist&quot; of her being a vampire would be a chance to redeem herself as the damsel in distress. It didn&#039;t. She still needed saving from her evil uncle. How disappointing.<br />
<br />
Given Yuuki&#039;s potential as a strong, textured female character, it&#039;s sad to think that she could easily fall into the Mary Sue category.

    There are no spoilers in this review, so it can come off as vague, but I didn&#039;t want to spoil anything for those who may read it!<br />
<br />
In my own list, I rated this as a 10 purely because I really, really loved it. But being more realistic, I think that in general, this anime is more like an 8 out of 10. <br />
I don&#039;t really understand the complaints about the romance. Yes, it&#039;s angsty at times, yes, it has some cliches. But this is literally a romance anime targeted at younger girls. If you have a problem with that, why would you watch it or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194337">
        rate it negatively? <br />
<br />
Ok, so now that I have that out of the way, I guess I&#039;ll go more into the series itself. I watched the first season because someone recommended it to me. I wasn&#039;t aware of what it was about, or what shoujo even was. I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of cleavage shots and other annoying things that typically occur in popular anime. It started out a little slow, but I love vampires, so I kept watching, and I&#039;m glad I did. <br />
<br />
The first season was pretty good, but nothing special. In my person opinion, the second one blows it out of the water. It is NOT confusing if you pay attention. The characters DO have development. I really question whether the people who made these complaints were fully watching the show or not. This definitely captures the feel of a gothic romance anime, but it also has a really good plot and other things to draw you in besides the romance. <br />
<br />
The second season did have some things that I would have preferred they explained more about because it would have been interesting. However, there were no huge plot holes that I could see or anything they left really unexplained that was necessary to the show. Maybe I&#039;m dumb, but I found myself genuinely surprised by some of the discoveries the characters made and the plot itself, in a good way. I didn&#039;t find it overly predictable at all.<br />
<br />
While there is an antagonist, VKG is more about Yuki, the main character, discovering herself. It continues well from the first season and doesn&#039;t seem like a sloppy add-on like some second seasons do (cough cough Black Butler cough cough). <br />
<br />
I&#039;d talk about the art but it&#039;s the same as VK. Pretty, with some exaggerations (Yuki&#039;s eyes for example). It also has background characters that get extremely basic designs, like VK. Nothing new.<br />
<br />
One thing I don&#039;t like is how few girls/women are in this show. Perhaps people watching shoujo don&#039;t like having women in it? I&#039;m not sure. It just disappointed me that one of the main girls, Luca, is mostly seen as a super jealous/stereotypically catty girl who doesn&#039;t like Yuki because of a dude. And the other main girl is the main character. Any other girls don&#039;t get big parts at all. But like I said, it&#039;s shoujo, so maybe I&#039;m just ignorant of how the genre usually is since I&#039;ve never watched it before.<br />
<br />
If you like romance but you also like a good mystery/action/supernatural/gothic anime, I definitely recommend you watch this. It&#039;s not perfect if I look at it objectively, but I absolutely loved it, and can&#039;t find anything else that comes close to being as fun to watch as VKG, or anything that gives me the same feeling when I watch it.
