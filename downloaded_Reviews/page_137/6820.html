It&#039;s boring as hell, uninteresting plot progression seemingly made to make viewers fall asleep (thanks for the early sleep), the characters are stale sculptures that are basically speedrunning Ozymandias downfall.<br />
<br />
Audiovisuals are generic because everything was spent on the 1st episode, like a ufotable turn Studio Deen type fall. The saving grace for sound was the OP/ED.<br />
<br />
Wow, this anime is neither enjoyable nor recommendable. Go watch Samurai Flamenco instead.<br />

    This show is totally fucking with us.<br />
The main girl is named Siesta. “Siesta” is Spanish for “nap.” <br />
And this show does nothing but put you to sleep.<br />
<br />
But that’s only if you’re lucky, because staying awake is torture. I know “The Detective is Already Dead” may sound like an enticing title, but don’t be fooled. This is a battle harem. It may not be set in an academy, and there may not be an arena for waifu fights, but the essential elements are there, and the show isn’t ashamed of this at all. In fact, it’s the only selling point. Why is a show about a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417271">
        middle school loser becoming Discount James Bond, traveling the world fighting international counterintelligence and terror organizations, but also aliens, mind controllers, werewolves, and superhuman androids enjoyed by anyone? Because he does so with a cute detective waifu at his side constantly trying to fall on his dick. I don’t know if it’s a spoiler to say this, but as the title suggests, the detective is, indeed, already dead, so everything I just described only takes place in flashbacks, and everything happening in present day consists of new, different girls trying to fall on his dick. This is actually genius when you think about it, because now you and the self-insert protagonist don’t have to choose a best girl, and can instead just fuck them both, one in the past, and another in the present. But I didn’t mean to so quickly sweep all that dumb shit under the rug. To say this show contains aliens, mind control, werewolves, and superhuman androids is not a spoiler, because they aren’t treated as mysteries nor presented as reveals. I know this may seem odd considering nothing about the premise or promotional material would suggest this show gets that ridiculous, but that’s just it. This show makes no attempt to build the world or make the setting feel distinctive. Everything will look and feel totally banal, and then suddenly you’re watching this indescribable Frankenstein’s Monster of disparate genres and ideas which don’t mix together at all. This may be a weird thing to say, but nothing in this show feels like it was done in the right order. Yes, the pacing is incompetent, but that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s hard to put this into words, but scenes are just so poorly considered and end up feeling awkward or like there’re taking place in the wrong context. The lifeless directing and ultra-generic art style don’t help either, because a weird and out-of-place character or concept will be introduced, and the music will change to try and switch the tone, but NOTHING changes visually, so the whole sequence just feels deadpan—like the building blocks making up the scene were ordered wrong or internally misplaced. <br />
<br />
With all that said, the real reason this show is such a boring piece of shit is plain and simple: it just has awful writing. Siesta’s motto as a detective is, “A first-rate detective gets a handle on a case before the incident occurs,” and this motto is the central gimmick of the series. We and our self-insert protagonist are the fish out of water, and Siesta is the seemingly clairvoyant, Holmesian mastermind who already holds all the relevant knowledge beforehand. We, the audience, are supposed to marvel at her intelligence, but what the author doesn’t understand is that this does not make for an interesting story. It is well-established that what makes detective stories engaging is the audience’s desire to solve the mystery with the clues and foreshadowing provided by the author, but if you know the author isn’t going to provide you with ANY clues or ANY foreshadowing, and is instead going to constantly pull random shit out of thin air and expect you to applaud his creativity, then you’ll immediately lose interest. However, what makes this show in particular its own special brand of retarded, is that explanatory information is withheld even during scenes which have nothing to do with mystery.<br />
<br />
This show is amazingly forthright with how contrived it is. <br />
Why does our teenage waifu decide to move in with our teenage protagonist half a day after they meet? <br />
Just because.<br />
Why does our middle school aged protagonist with no credentials get an international license to carry by an intelligence syndicate? <br />
Just because.<br />
Why does Waifu #2 get a heart transplant that magically imbues her with the thoughts and emotions of the heart’s original owner?<br />
Just because.<br />
Why can our normal human waifu safely jump out of a building wearing a dress, high heels, and carrying our protagonist in her arms?<br />
Just because.<br />
Why does Waifu #3 stop some random asshole on the street who she’s never met before and assume he’s a legendary detective?<br />
Just because.<br />
Why does our waifu’s blood turn into bullets, and why do those bullets magically revoke a person’s free will?<br />
Just because.<br />
Why does our protagonist scream “It’s time for My Teen Romantic Comedy™!” despite rejecting our waifu’s romanic advances? <br />
Just for the memes.<br />
<br />
I have twelve episodes worth of this bullshit to chose from, so trust me when I say I could do this all day. Any principle fixture of the plot or character chemistry is totally preposterous, and it’s not even in service of anything interesting. Remember, this show is just a battle harem, yet in its attempts to stand out, it just embarrasses itself when it probably would’ve been better off relying on more standard concepts. The show still would’ve been a boring piece of shit, but at least it wouldn’t be so confusing and dumb.<br />
<br />
This show is also amazingly forthright with how trashy it is. It may rattle off endless dialogue in an attempt to feel intelligent, if only on a kindergarten level, but its fanservice is flagrant. Don’t get me wrong. There is certainly diegetic fanservice—like whenever one of the girls squats or bends over right in front of the main guy’s crotch like a porn actress, we’re treated to a nice shot of her exposed lower-back and ass—but there will also be totally lecherous and nonsensical shots of girls’ bodies apropos of nothing. This isn’t even mentioning all the ridiculous shit the characters do in service of pandering which totally shatterers your suspension of disbelief. Waifu #2 is literally introduced by walking up to the main guy, shoving her hand down his throat, fingering his tongue, removing her hand covered in drool, talking down to him like a dominatrix, and then smothering his face in her tits. Seriously, is this a new fetish or something? What that fuck is this?<br />
<br />
It is genuinely challenging for me to describe the characters in this show without describing other characters from other anime. Siesta tells the main guy he’s perfect for covert detective work because his face is so unexceptional, anyone who sees it will quickly forget about it. This is funny not simply because I can say the exact same thing about this show in its entirety, but because I can also say the same thing about her and every other one-dimensional, cardboard character from within it.<br />
<br />
Watch Re:Starting Life in Another World From Zero™.<br />
Take Emilia. Cut her hair into an even bob, leave her ribbon on the right side, remove the flower, and make her eyes blue instead of purple.<br />
Take Rem’s obsequious, unconditional love, but also Ram’s wry cleverness, and combine them into one girl. <br />
Congratulations. You’ve crafted Siesta from scratch. Now you have a sexy waifu to leer at, but one who you can also appreciate as an intellectual equal despite your apprehension toward women.<br />
<br />
Watch NISIOISIN’s Monogatari Series™.<br />
Take Araragi. Replace his disheveled hair with something more generic and refined, and widen his eyes a little too.<br />
Take his relatable cynicism, but remove all the character complexity and past experience which makes his personality believable.<br />
Congratulations. You’ve crafted the main guy from scratch. Now you can self-insert without having to be reminded of your social flaws which make this kind of escapist fantasy attractive to you in the first place.<br />
<br />
The main character’s real name is Kimihiko Kimizuka. In light of this, Siesta decides to nickname him “Kimi.” This makes sense considering his name, but what the show attempts to lampshade is the fact “kimi” is the Japanese word for “you.” If you’ve never seen one of these self-insert harem shows, this may seem meaningless, but if you’re familiar with the way these shows work, you probably see why this is so unbelievably shameless. The dialogue scenes in these shows often use a Shot/Reverse Shot directing style, so when the waifu on screen is talking to the main guy stood across from her, she is effectively just talking directly into the camera. In other words, she’s looking at and speaking to the audience. This is prefect for self-insert escapism, and there are even shows like One Room which consist exclusively of a girl talking to the camera and pretending to be your girlfriend, but this show has found a way to have its cake and eat it too. Unlike One Room, it has a real cast of characters, but in practice, it almost nullifies this fact by having the waifu refer to the main character as “you” instead of his actual name, so you can just jerk off and not have to worry about hearing another man’s name ruining the fantasy, because as far as you’re concerned, she’s talking to you. If not so morally contemptible, this manipulation would be hilarious.<br />
<br />
“The novel is better.” <br />
This statement is a fallacy. While it’s true most anime are just advertisements for the source material, especially those produced by companies like Kadokawa, shilling the source material to your fellow anime fans is assuming they actually give a shit about reading it, but I don’t. I’m trying to find good anime, not good manga, and certainly not good light novels. Given the absurd amount of monotonous dialogue packed into this show, it’s effectively a novel in and of itself, so if it’s any consolation, this show is still a piece of shit even if you’re only viewing it as an advertisement for the novel. After all, it gives me no reason to assume the novel which it’s advertising is any less shitty, and even if the novel isn’t shitty, that fact wouldn’t somehow make the anime less shitty. If you ever see someone throwing around the word “secondary” as an insult, you know the point they’re making is wrongheaded. Attempting to discredit someone’s opinion on an anime because they haven’t read the source material is a flawed line of thinking, because it’s attempting to force a conflation between adaptations and supplemental materials, when in reality, an adaptation is its own work which should be criticized on its own merits. These people may be correct, and the source material may be better, but it doesn’t defend the anime, and that’s what we’re talking about here.<br />
<br />
I almost forgot to mention how ugly this show is. I think it goes without saying it’s artistically soulless, but even on a technical level, it’s just poorly produced. The first episode isn’t mind-boggling or anything, but it’s serviceable, and it has a few cuts of cool animation. However, this premier is unapologetic bait on which all efforts were expended and all good animators were invited, and everything afterward looks progressively worse. The background quality drops to the point it can be painful to watch, and the animation is never too far behind. This is often the case with light novel adaptations, but this show has a particularly bad case of shitty character designs. Light novel cover art is extremely detailed, so it’s rare for an animation studio to adapt these designs faithfully into an anime, but any character designer worth his or her salt shouldn’t have a hard time simplifying the designs for a proper adaptation. However, if the character designer is a hack or if the studio just doesn’t have the talent, and if this ineptitude is then combined with shitty animation, that’s how you end up with shows like Overlord, Youjo Senki, 86, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, or this fucking trainwreck. I think I’m going to give this show a One, but I honestly believe it deserves a Two. It wasn’t downright offensive, and its only real crime was waterboarding me with boredom, so in all fairness, it probably deserves a Two, but it simply has no redeeming qualities. If you put a gun to my head, I still wouldn’t be able to say anything unconditionally nice about it. I mean, frankly, if you put a gun to my head, so long as it allowed me to stop watching this trash, I’d pull the fucking trigger for you. <br />

    Never heard of this show, Synopsis didn&#039;t really give any viable information on what the plot is. Heck even the cover art doesn&#039;t match the title for some reason. The detective is already dead? but what&#039;s the harem of girls at the back? <br />
<br />
Watched it and well..<br />
<br />
The 1st episode was good, 50 minutes long, a massive leadup to the twist provided in the synopsis. We get introduced to the Mc and Siesta, the mythical powers in the world along with the antagonists gets introduced. It was good, we get to see how the two become partners albeit for one episode only. <br />
<br />
Then we get episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409875">
        2-4 and things go down the drain, what looked like a promising concept turned into a bunny girl senpai-esque harem show with Date a live looking characters.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 was sort of good? I mean we did get Nagisa and a bit of Siesta but whatever plot idea we got from that episode was thrown out the door when episode 3 came along.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s tough<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to be too harsh to this adaptation because I&#039;ve heard good things about the ln but.....<br />
<br />
I was so disappointed with the recent episodes, mainly because it went against my expectations but in the wrong way. I&#039;m a fan of harem shows don&#039;t get me wrong but I just don&#039;t like it when it goes this kind of route.  <br />
<br />
Let me repeat, the disappointment isn&#039;t because the show doesn&#039;t live up to the hype people said it has, it is because it changes plots so suddenly, from a seemingly mystery thriller to becoming a romance/harem show with a sprinkle of mystery to returning back to a mystery thriller the next episode then becoming a beach episode.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s this inconsistency that really brings this show down, it feels like its trying to appeal to as much people as possible rather than commit to what has already been setup<br />
you have an established antagonist group from the 1st episode, a twist of Siesta dying and the middle schooler mc having to deal with it, I won&#039;t blame you if you think this was a mystery anime. Heck Episode 2 as well made me think oh cool so it keeps the mystery theme along with referencing Siesta and the addition of Nagisa to the detective crew?<br />
<br />
Then it pulls a 180 on episode 3 and 4, it keeps a little mystery in exchange we get a cute girl with seemingly no connection to Siesta at all. <br />
<br />
-It still remains the same up until Episode 6 so far- inconsistent plot and all<br />
<br />
<br />
Also why do some of the characters look like bootleg characters from other harem shows? Siesta looks and talks like Origami from date a live albeit with a little more emotion heck Saikawa is bootleg Kurumi as well.<br />
<br />
Animation is lacking but that&#039;s understandable coming from a new studio.<br />
<br />
The show has been disappointing but it&#039;s a fiesta, the plot is everywhere and that&#039;s probably why you should watch it. It&#039;s a mess of an adaptation.<br />
<br />
also cameo from god and fox friend in episode 3.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give it a 5 for now, I don&#039;t want to be too harsh especially since I like the mystery genre<br />

    The plot is already dead.<br />
<br />
I found episode 1 to be really entertaining. But then the enjoyment declined and declined. I saw kind of a potential in the story itself but every episode it continued to be a train waiting to derail of its rail. The fifth episode did it for me. The characters are bland, the sound doesn&#039;t hit good enough -- well maybe, the sound itself isn&#039;t at fault but the emotional build-up just doesn&#039;t help. Whatever it did try, it simply didn&#039;t work.<br />
<br />
This is an prime example of how not to direct an anime and write a story. This is simple waifu bait.

    The Detective is Already Dead gives off an ambigious feeling of uncertainity. And by that, I do mean how potential viewers should expect from the show altogether. Let&#039;s face it, the English title should also fire some questions into your head. You may be asking yourself why the detective is &#039;already dead&#039; or who really dies in the show. In what seems like a thematically intriguing premise quickly turns sour when we realize just how mediocre this actually turned out to be.<br />
<br />
Taking a step back, I didn&#039;t want to be judgmental at first glance. In fact, I was actually impressed by some of the promotional

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417276">
        material it showed off, especially a gun wielding girl fighting what seemingly taking place on board an aircraft. It&#039;s very confrontational from the start and leaves little room to breath for the first episode. To further its experience, the show decided to air the action style pilot at double the standard length, as a way to give us a taste of what to expect. Does the first episode make or break the chance to enjoy the anime? Let&#039;s find out.<br />
<br />
For starters, we do meet two prominent characters - Siesta and Kimihiko as they get caught in the middle of a plane hijacking. To make matters worse, the hijacker has supernatural abilities that can threaten everyone aboard the plane. Siesta&#039;s request to Kimihiko to become her assistant is replied with ambigiouity although he has little choice than to team up if they both want to survive. It sets forth the core of the show as the duo begin their adventures together. Fast forward and later, they are thrown into a high school setting and for some reason, the anime decided to add in a wedding dress for Siesta. I&#039;ll leave that to your imagination but let&#039;s just say that such a transition is a massive direction in setting. But you may still be asking yourself: just who exactly is Siesta?<br />
<br />
With Kimihiko&#039;s rotten luck, you&#039;d expect him to be the last person on Earth to meet a stunning girl like Siesta. Even more so, he becomes her partner after displaying his innate skills in a complicated situation. Watching the two work together at first seemed as mysterious as the main premise itself. They have nothing in common but are seemingly bound by fate. It&#039;s not soon after when the story transits into meaning of the anime&#039;s title and we find out who the dead detective is. However, it would also appear that Kimihiko isn&#039;t fully ready to move on with his life and this draws him to other girls such as Nagisa. From here, his life gets perhaps even more complicated than ever before.<br />
<br />
Now I want to be discret and warn that the anime&#039;s story can be a bit confusing at times. From what the anime adapted, some novels are out of order and it deepens the confusion. It&#039;s not that the anime is difficult to understand but that it doesn&#039;t follow a traditional chapter-by-chapter adaptation format. Watching this anime did show me the depth of Kimihiko&#039;s personality as he develops peculiar relationships among its cast. Unfortunately, most of these lacks the sort of concrete depth you should be expecting. For instance, Kimihiko&#039;s character relationship with Nagisa is bleak at best as the girl practically forces him to help her. Their confrontation can almost be described as brutal and replusive to the point where Kimihiko feels like a victim. That is to say, it&#039;s also hard to feel sorry for Kimihiko when we can&#039;t get fully invested into his character. We don&#039;t know much about his past except for his relationship with Siesta. In respect, I think it&#039;s dangerous for the anime to plant the story in this direction. We can only ask ourselves more and more questions about the past while almost being neglected to know about the present. Then again, this is a mystery anime, right?<br />
<br />
In some aspects, I do appreciate at how the show handles its mystery in terms of revelations. While some story segments are easily predictable, others can be misguided and with red herrings. However, it&#039;s not a complicated storyteller where the show feels like a puzzle. What&#039;s unsettling about the storytelling is the way the anime depicts Siesta&#039;s overall character role. She goes from alive to dead in different episodes and sometimes, you have to ask yourself what exactly the author wants you to experience. Sorrow? Suspense? Ambiguity? In essence, I ask myself what the purpose of the premise really is. Yes, the detective is already dead but at the same time, she is also alive. I think from the beginning, killing a character like Siesta permantely would set off a massive red flag so the series avoids this by bringing her back in different ways. It&#039;s clever on some levels but also disappointing. Why? Let&#039;s just say that the more times she is on screen, the less appealing the mystery is. If it can even be called that...because honest to God, the &#039;mystery&#039; of the show is more of an amateur detective fiction.<br />
<br />
Holding the show further back is the reminder of the cast. Among them advertised from the key visuals include Yui, Charlotte, Alicia, and Nagisa. Yes, this anime may not be a harem but having Kimihiko pair up with them gives off a stench. Oh and did I almost forgot to mention the SPES? That&#039;s a mysterious organization who is deeply involved with Siesta. Unfortunately, the show does a poor job at making them look like a credible threat or at least one for fans to invest into. The more and I watched the anime, the less appealing it felt with each episode lacking the thrilling suspense I anticipated. The characters are underdeveloped and far too much emphasis is dedicated to Siesta, whether she&#039;s dead or alive. If I wanted to see a mystery anime, I could&#039;ve picked up something more coherent. What we got here is nothing short of a jumble of incoherent mess.<br />
<br />
But....I do want to praise the anime&#039;s visual quality. While the main story lacked a compelling plot, the artistic visuals speaks another language. The female cast such as Siesta, Charlotte, and Nagisa are characterized with alluring appeals that makes them stand out compared to almost anyone else. Furthermore, the consistency of colorful backgrounds is clear from the very first episode. It also falls no short in showing the action sequence and violence on occasions, when given the opportunity. Elsewhere, there&#039;s also some degrees of fan service such as the classy swimsuit episode or when Nagisa ruthlessly bullies Kimihiko with suggestive yet sexy behavior. <br />
<br />
Yes, that&#039;s it. To call this show a deep complex mystery would be an illusion. What started as an appealing premiere ended up being one of the most underwhelming anime of the Summer 2021 season. That&#039;s not an exaggeration because after watching the anime, I felt almost betrayed. If you want better a mystery, watch something with an actual planned out plot and meaningful character cast. This ain&#039;t it folks.

    Watching anime that has something to do with detective isn’t really my cup of tea. That’s why I didn’t find the need to watch ‘Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru’ in the first place. But I binged it anyway as I had nothing to do on the weekend. And to my surprise, it was actually a great watch.  <br />
<br />
First of all, let’s talk about the story, the most important aspect of all in a mystery anime. At first, I thought the plot of this show would be complicated as hell, but it turns out to be simple. It’s all about Kimizuka, a teenage boy that had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409860">
        an unexpected encounter with a detective girl named Siesta. He was given the chance to be her wingman. Before he knew it, he was already on his first mission as an assistant. The title of the series, The Detective Is Already Dead, clearly portrays what’s going on in the anime. Because by the end of the first episode, it’s shown that Siesta died three years after working together as a team with Kimizuka. <br />
<br />
Later in the episode, Kimizuka got to meet Nagisa, one of his classmates. Nagisa had a complicated heart problem, and on the verge of death, she had a heart transplant from someone that she’s not familiar with. Little did she know that the heart she received belongs to none other than Siesta. Later, she did an investigation with Kimizuka to find everything out. There’s another girl named Yui that will be introduced by the end of the second episode.<br />
<br />
I have zero complaints about the story in this show. It always got me curious to know what happens in the next episode. Actually, it’s not the story that I want to talk about the most, it’s the animation. I was expecting it to be something, but it turns out to be not as superb. I guess it’s part of my fault to expect a godly animation from a studio that is unheard of. As for the sound, just like the story, I have zero complaints. Sound aside, one thing that really caught my attention is the characters. They’re really interesting to watch, and they can be funny at times. For that reason, this series has successfully shown its capability in terms of comedy. <br />
<br />
All of all, I really enjoyed watching ‘Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru’. It has interesting stories, great characters, and a decent animation. I can safely recommend this show for everybody with no exception. <br />
<br />
Edit: Maybe I&#039;ll try to make a different review once the anime ends.<br />

    Between the good anime and the enjoyably bad anime sit the ones that are unremarkable in every way, and you can’t help but wish you hadn’t wasted your time watching it. The Detective is Already Dead fits this role perfectly. With one-dimensional characters, an unengaging story, and plain awful visuals, there is next to no praise that can be given for the series. Don’t worry though, as it makes up for this by making sure there’s at least one cute girl in every scene.<br />
<br />
There is an abundance of poorly directed scenes that lack the intended impact that they were going for. The moments that are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417275">
        supposed to feel emotional will feel no different from every other scene. This is due to a number of reasons but ultimately comes down to the flat characters and their lackluster responses to anything that happens. The art and animation quality doesn’t help either when every character is awkwardly placed in a scene with a blank expression. As a viewer, you don’t know what you’re supposed to feel at a scene because it never gives you a good reason to feel a certain way. All it does is chuck in a couple of potentially sad scenes without using proper visual techniques to back it up.<br />
<br />
You might’ve noticed a certain mystery tag on the show but don’t be fooled, there are essentially no mystery elements to be found. I’m not even sure if Mystery was supposed to be a major aspect of the plot, but when mysteries are present they are handled terribly. In most good mystery anime, you&#039;ll find that it engages you with foreshadowing, hints at a greater narrative, and an exciting sense of discovery. The best part of mysteries is when you feel as though you are figuring out the plot right along with the characters. This anime, however, makes no attempt at the aforementioned techniques. Instead of uncovering the plot with the characters, you will be stuck watching as the main character figures things on his own with no explanation to the viewer. Then, once the whole “mystery” is over he will explain it all in one big long scene of boring dialogue. The foreshadowing is atrocious, and the only purpose mystery serves is to make our main character look all clever by the end of it. I’m not kidding when I say one episode of Scooby-Doo would have better mysteries than what this show tries to do.<br />
<br />
The characters were particularly frustrating throughout the show, including everyone’s beloved white-haired waifu, Siesta. I felt physical pain every time there was attempted humour in the dialogue. It’s obvious what they were going for with the main character’s deadpan reactions and Siesta’s typical kuudere bluntness, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a worse attempt at it. The dialogue aims to be clever but never achieves more than being flat and unfunny. While I can at least give credit for the attempts at fun dialogue for the main duo, the rest of the characters are simply boring. It amounts to nothing more than some basic personalities slapped onto a generic character design. I find it amazing that they can describe the main character as ‘forgettable’ throughout the show and not wonder if having a forgettable main character is actually a bad thing. <br />
<br />
Of course, these major issues don’t matter when there are some cute girls in the show. While going about defeating the big bad organization the main character manages to get several cute girls on his side to help him fight his battles. In fact, he’s so good at attracting cute girls that there isn’t a single other male character that isn’t on the side of the antagonists. I feel like this would be a given at this point, but don’t expect any sort of character development. Even after a character&#039;s death, which is so major that they included it in the title, we don’t get to see any characters attempt to cope with it. Instead they just sort of go on about their lives and all is okay right after a time skip.<br />
<br />
There are times where the writing in this series can feel even childish. Take the antagonistic force for example, it’s nothing more than a generic evil organization given the name ‘SPES.’ Things like the motives and ideologies of the organization aren’t clearly explained and the representatives of the organization are your average bad guys. It’s unable to challenge the views of the protagonist, only seeking to end the world. It would’ve been much better if it stuck to one clear villain that can properly conflict with the protagonist’s own motives and world views. The series thinks up one cool scenario, such as a plane hijacking for an opening episode, and never uses it to its advantage.<br />
<br />
If you were hoping for visuals to make up for this prepare to be disappointed. Some people may view the quality to be acceptable, especially after an okay first episode, but you can easily see it drop right from the second episode. For starters, I couldn’t help but notice that most scenes would just leave out crowds from backgrounds making the whole show feel isolated. Movement is stiff and the fight scenes avoid movement as much as possible, just throwing in still shots of characters talking rather than fighting. The expressions fail to give a good impression of a character&#039;s feelings and are never more detailed than the average wide-eyes shocked face. As far as soundtracks go this one was unimpressive and forgettable. It never quite matched the scene and added little value to the show as a whole. I might just be nitpicking here, but there was a noticeable amount of sound effects missing that the show needed. Scenes felt quiet because of this and were unable to really stick out as something important.<br />
<br />
The Detective is Already Dead is awful in every way possible. It calls itself a mystery yet fails to actually provide engaging mysteries. The characters are nothing new, though I can guarantee that people will watch this for the sole purpose of seeing more Siesta. On top of this, it doesn’t even have good visuals or soundtracks to back it up. It’s what happens when a studio has no sense of direction or time management, only seeking to capitalize on a popular light novel, and I would recommend staying clear of it if you value your time.<br />

    The detective may be already dead, but this entire show was already dead from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Tanmoshi was one of the most highly anticipated anime series from the year 2021, but ultimately ended up as one of the most disappointing and underwhelming shows, instead. With how the anime industry’s priorities are, it was doomed to be a failure from the start, and this isn’t anything new at all, especially with most light novel adaptations. However, Tanmoshi, also known as Tantei Wa Mou Shindeiru / The Detective Is Already Dead, has more inherent problems aside from the typical issues with adapting light novels. Keep in mind that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417273">
        I’m judging this series based more so on what I received in anime form, not the source material.<br />
<br />
The introduction of the story is just odd, especially with the very title of the show, and how it doesn’t seem to fit with the key visuals. The title literally indicates “the detective is already dead” and advocates mystery drama, but the art covers looks like something out of a vanilla harem romance series. I understand the series likely intended to throw people off on purpose to give the sense of suspense and speculation, but such an initial presentation risks giving the viewers a unfavorably warped vision of what to expect. The series starts off by introducing a young man named Kimizuka Kimihiko. He is presented as an individual who keeps getting into trouble due to apparently being “born unlucky”. He’s conveniently made into the “doom magnet” loner protagonist, rigged for the inevitable “faithful encounter”. May I also mention that I’m forced to accept he’s actually of middle to high school age despite looking straight up like a 20-year-old businessman? I’m not new at all to this in fiction or reality, but this case is just odd, cause his personality doesn’t seem to add up with how his maturity of his mindset may be in accordance to his age. Upon getting caught up in an airplane hijacking, Kimihiko unsurprisingly gets that “faithful encounter” of his upon meeting Siesta, a woman who calls herself “the legendary detective”. She is smooth-talking, white-haired, and very witty; a perfect character to be subjected to “simping” by the fans, as she becomes easily the most interesting thing from the show, for better or worse. After being constantly pestered by Siesta, Kimihiko finally agrees to be her sidekick, and that where’s the story begins...except not really.<br />
<br />
The premiere episode is rather long...too long, in all honesty. Double-length episodes aren’t necessarily a good choice, as they tend to test the viewer’s ability to stay interested throughout the entire length of the broadcast; it can make people lost interest to continue as a result. Shorter normal-length episodes are more favorable to allow for one to refresh and keep track of everything presented so far. Tanmoshi’s double-length premiere was half interesting, half tiresome. The first half wasn’t that a good a presentation, but it was somewhat decent enough, introducing us to the main protagonists and giving us a taste of what to expect. The best ever part was presented here: an array of impressively fluid animated cuts of Siesta fighting a random bad guy who looks like he belonged in Tokyo Ghoul. For at least a span of around a minute, it was quite a decent visual spectacle, but it merely serves to hide the dismal state of the series’  overall production quality. Nearly everything else afterwards feels so lackadaisical. The dialogue between the characters honestly feels so lethargic, flat, and suffocating, like it was practically ripped directly from the source material without anything trimmed or changed up. The second half of the premiere follows with a jarring change of pace, dropping us into a school festival segment. From what I was told, it was supposed to get us invested into Siesta as a character, but it felt more like a messy rearranging of the chronology of events in the story. By the time the episode is over, we are given that “plot twist”, that “the detective (Siesta) is already dead”. This just feels untimely. The series introduces us to the main female protagonist, only just to take her out of the picture entirely by the end of the very same episode, even if it may be temporary.<br />
<br />
After that long premiere, the rest of the story feels more like your typical romance harem-esque series with convoluted and contrived supernatural and mystery elements. More characters are randomly introduced for the sake of complicating the plot while lacking notable development or established dynamics on their end. The second female character Nagisa is introduced and established as being connected to Siesta. She is ultimately a pivotal point to initiate what was supposed to be...an emotional segment with Kimihiko and Nagisa regarding the fate of Siesta herself? The reveal itself was nothing commendable, as the direction was stale and lacked a sense of impact, with very little buildup prior. When the third female character Yui Saikawa is introduced, she is presented with barely much importance to the story. Her supposedly rough backstory related to her idol career lacks weight and doesn’t justify her twisted character motives. I sure as hell didn’t like how she easily gets all friendly in the end, despite all that previous intent to kill the main protagonist for the silliest reasons. The show’s illogical attempts to elicit emotions and expect the audience to feel for it is laughable. There’s next to nothing there to get invested in whatever backstory or background the characters get. It also really doesn’t help that the tone-deaf dialogue that I mentioned before is ever so present. There’s next to no sense of good chemistry between the characters, either; everyone seems too reclusive and obliged to initiate a free-flowing conversation. The show tries to sound witty and use humor and fanservice every now and then to try to change up the tone, only just to fall on deaf ears. The mystery elements themselves turn out to be extremely uninteresting; there’s underground organizations, android/cyborg technology, and supernatural organisms ripped straight outta Parasyte The Maxim, but there’s lack of intrigue and hook. The series doesn’t seem to know where to go and how to utilize such story aspects, as it only seems to pander to the usual tropes you’d find in any romcom or harem. Whatever further twists and revelations within the series that do come up felt either awkwardly inserted or insanely obvious.<br />
<br />
The show jumps back and forth between the present day and flashbacks of when Siesta and Kimihiko were still together. It’s bad enough that you take her out of the picture early on, but then to insert her back in after the audience was told she was dead early on...that only begets inconsistency in direction. In repeated attempts to get us as an audience to get attached to Siesta, it instead has many of us wondering why go back and forth between the past and present to begin with. What are we supposed to be truly focused on? The mystery regarding Siesta’s death? The villainous groups’ motives? The other girls Kimihiko randomly meets whom are supposed to play major roles? What exactly is the series trying to tell us? Why does it feel the need to move things out of order? The plot is literally all over the place. It fails to connect the dots when it needs to. It haphazardly plays with plot conveniences and trivialities without much care. I know it’s possible to produce a great series that follows an achronological order with the proper direction and execution, but Tanmoshi doesn’t seem to have any of that.<br />
<br />
The characters are apparently supposed to be the main strength of the series, but they’re so uninspiring and dry in terms of how they were written out. Kimihiko being presented as the “unlucky” loner makes him obnoxiously dull and hard to relate to, especially when it involves his lackluster interactions with Siesta and the other girls. I mentioned Siesta’s characterization before, but I need to mention how she doesn’t seem too useful aside from these annoying extended monologues, “magical” plot devices, and repeating the same catchphrase “Baka ga, kimi wa” over and over (oh how convenient that “kimi” is part of the main guy’s name); she ends up quite predictable and tiresome after a while. I really hate how both of the leads are made to look and sound smarter than they really are. All the other notable characters aren’t any better. Nagisa, the very female character with the closest established connection, comes off as the typical headstrong character archetype who turned out so clumsily written. Yui is the obligatory child idol character who’s said to be very mature, but has very conflicting and unfounded initial motives. Charlotte has….quite a “mother” complex with Siesta and not much else. Due to how the story direction is so disjointed, none of these characters were really given enough distributed development and highlights to really feel important.<br />
<br />
Aside from the few impressive cuts from an animator known as Ryuuki Hashimoto, the aesthetics of the show are just dreadful and soulless. Backgrounds are stitched up with zero sense of depth and realism. Inanimate objects like boats, planes, or cars seem like they were awkwardly cropped and dragged onto the frameworks right outta a photoshop app. The character designs are fairly decent but generic and seemed ripped off from numerous actual harem shows out there (like say….Date A Live?). Color tones and palettes are overly monotone and lack much variation. The camera work is uninspiring and lackluster and fails to deliver any sense of impactfulness to select scenes. Most of the overall art direction and composition in general looked amateur and half-assed. Like there was one particular scene with an idol concert that was absolutely horrendous and looked like it was done by an elementary schooler. Honestly it felt like those few amazingly fluid cuts were used to bait viewers into watching it, especially in the preview trailers. From the likes of ENGI, a relatively new studio not known for making even half-decent shows, all of this should’ve been expected, but it’s a disappointing blemish, nonetheless, and with how animation quality is more advocated and desired nowadays, it’s an extremely tough break. The soundtracks are dull and nothing special at all. The opening and ending themes are typical-sounding and not evocative enough to be something particularly memorable. Even the voice acting feels soulless and devoid of passion, as if the seiyuus don’t seem to give much care for what seems like simply another one of those countless vanilla-flavored series. I know animation and sound quality isn’t supposed be the ultimate ride-or-die rule, but art direction and writing quality go hand in hand nearly every time, but here they’re merely touching fingers.<br />
<br />
From an enjoyment standpoint, I can’t help but feel let down overall, despite having kept my expectations at a minimum. I genuinely enjoy it quite a bit early on, but I still had issues here and there. As the series progresses and jumped back and forth, it became hard for me to really keep being invested in any positive story elements. I didn’t really like or enjoy any of the characters aside from Siesta, even she ended up not being much more than mild passable entertainment. It’s not like I was expecting a godly light novel adaptation like 86 or Mushoku Tensei, but Tanmoshi couldn’t even pass for me as half-decent. By the time the series ended, I’ve given up trying to follow the confusing chronology of the plot and any particular details it might’ve had, cause it left no impact for me at the end of all of it.<br />
<br />
Tanmoshi is the epitome of both a failed adaptation and a failed anime all in one, and the near-perfect example of how NOT to write and direct a series. In the end, it winds up as yet another typical LN-derived story with no innovation or coherency to stand out from the rest of the pack. Kadokawa shat this series out without any care for the health of its production value. Perhaps the worst part is how it badly reflects its source material, which by all means should be far, far superior. Despite the popularity it begot from the light novel community, all the praise is more oriented toward its source material, instead. Unless you’re curious to see just how bad a LN adaptation can get, I suggest you turn away and look for more innovative premises and ideas, instead. Otherwise, you’ll end up with one of the biggest jebaiting moments in anime history.

    - so this show was one of the most hyped show this season. have a great premise, the concept is also good but do I think they live up to the hype ? no, to be honest they do it backwards. instead of getting better by episode, all I see was disaster. <br />
<br />
-episode 1:<br />
<br />
-the only thing that I can praise in this episode was the fight on the airplane. damn man, gonna need that scene to be one of the best fight scene this year. <br />
<br />
-I dislike how they suddenly went from the hectic scenario from the airplane, and then suddenly move on to school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411032">
        festival out of nowhere. I heard that they make some rearrangement from the light novel. one of their LN fans said that it was for the audience to get invested in this siesta character. but for me, that&#039;s seriously a bad take. they should just limit it only to 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
-episode 2:<br />
<br />
-I mean like siesta just death was like 1 year ago. and he finally get to go to school again, and suddenly this new girl just came to him, and then out of nowhere she already receive the heart transplant (obviously getting it from siesta). it was even resolved just in one episode .and then they go to that kind of drama where they said that siesta heart longing for the mc even after she died. and then nagisa slap him for not being sensitive and all. man I literally watch that scene with a straight face. not enough development, this nagisa girl was also just introduced a while ago. that&#039;s really a bad execution for the drama part. <br />
<br />
-yeah it&#039;s been like 1 year since she got the heart transplant, but the thing was we actually didn&#039;t see what she felt in that one year. that&#039;s why the scene between her and the mc in the jail felt off. there is not enough build up to feel maybe sad, sympathy, or something like that.<br />
<br />
-and okay so he is now a third year student in high school, so maybe his age is like between 17-18. So the fight on the airplane was 4 years ago. are you telling me they went to all that adventure begin when that guy was 13-14 ? He wasn&#039;t behave like a middle schooler at all and he looks the same even after 4 years oh god. man who tf design this character, we need to talk.<br />
<br />
-episode 3:<br />
<br />
-for this episode, I don&#039;t have much to complain, it&#039;s just the scene where nagisa finally get ready to move on after what happened to her was horribly executed. her back story was so short man. I just can&#039;t get invested in her past story and it ended up with this kind of half cooked conclusion.<br />
<br />
-episode 4:<br />
<br />
-arrive late to the concert, didn&#039;t have communication tools(walkie talkie, etc), didn&#039;t use your connection with the police to ask the for personal guards at the concert. ma boy I thought you were the assistant for the legendary detective for 3 years ? nah man what tf is all of these.<br />
<br />
- and also why did you bother to make all the deduction but just to blame that spes organization or whatever their name every single time. I mean c&#039;mon you already know from the start, don&#039;t bother to make this a mystery if you already know who tf planned all this shit.<br />
<br />
- and then you have a loli with a fucking pistol and tried to kill you, and the solution was a &quot;do you want to be our friend ?&quot; and the loli just cry all over the place, end. haha man that was just madness. we don&#039;t even see the loli reaction after getting threaten by the spes, we didn&#039;t see her desperateness to be alive, was he scared, was she in despair because no one there to help her. but in the end, a mere &quot;you want to be my friend ?&quot; was the conclusion for a girl who tried to kill you. absolute madness<br />
<br />
-episode 5<br />
<br />
-tbh, I quite like this episode. you can see that the story about cerberus really well constructed. We&#039;ve got the introduction in the first 10 min, some action in the middle and a good cliffhanger in the end. idk why they can&#039;t do this from the start of the series.<br />
<br />
-even so, I don&#039;t understand why did they include that fan service at the start, seriously unnecessary and also a mf mecha out of nowhere in the end of the episode. they really shouldn&#039;t even include comedy tag in there tbh, they need to put the whole circus as the tag in there. but overall I really like this episode. at least, it&#039;s not as disastrous as the previous 4. <br />
<br />
-episode 6<br />
<br />
-once again, I would say when you keep going back and forth so much time, the consistency wasn&#039;t there. it&#039;s not only on the story, but also the characters as well. so in this episode we&#039;ve seen where siesta nearly die there, even though we all know she not gonna die that easily. my question is they&#039;ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already, isn&#039;t there any life threathening situation similar in this episode ? and also the way kimizuka reacts, it&#039;s the same as nagisa&#039;s scene in episode 2, doesn&#039;t really felt anything on it. this is what happened when there are no exact build up on it. <br />
<br />
-also in this episode, I would say they will never go to that kind of fully serious route. at first, you thought that damn this shit finally going to get serious, and then suddenly you got a loli with an amnesia out of nowhere get into the team. and then that loli probably gonna have a specific power to solve the current case. <br />
<br />
-episode 7<br />
<br />
- I really think their major problem is their consistency on the story direction. I mean in this type of story which revolves around detective, investigation and all this kind of shit, personally I love to see they go to a more darker theme. this is because they basically deal with that spes organization that cost people lives all the time, that&#039;s some heavy cases to be considered. it&#039;s not like they deal with light cases such as what you see in hyouka for example.<br />
<br />
-so when I see they split it to like half of it was dark and half of it was light. for me they need to at least decide which direction they want to go. basically in this episode, it&#039;s just a useless shit that don&#039;t even contribute anything to the story. when there are episodes that didn&#039;t heavily involve with the spes, they basically just give us that kind of romantic moment between kimi and siesta. it&#039;s like giving kids candies after they gone through a shit day.  it&#039;s not like I&#039;m against that kind of &quot;light&quot; episodes or something, nah I&#039;m good with it. but the point is, it&#039;s so obvious that they want to go 50/50 with the direction. and for me, that ain&#039;t something that I love to see tbh.<br />
<br />
-episode 8<br />
<br />
- once again , they failed to connect these characters to the actual timeline . like what I&#039;ve said before , they&#039;ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already , the amount of emotion they emitted were ridiculous . it&#039;s also applied on how they act , c&#039;mon I thought this siesta girl was the great detective , why the hell she didn&#039;t take any action before those victim die ? I mean what the actual hell man , they treat it like this was their first mission . it doesn&#039;t make sense at all bruh . and also the way their shifting the story&#039;s tone , just pick one , either you want to go happy or serious , that&#039;s it . <br />
<br />
- and how they exclude the op and ed theme , man I&#039;m expecting something big ,I mean we all know if any show going full throttle without iclue their op and ed theme , that episode gonna go wild . but as usual , all we got was half assed made episode .<br />
<br />
-episode 9<br />
<br />
- yeah we&#039;ve got another talk no jutsu scene . the first one koumori , the second one saikawa , and they ad more to the list in this episode lol . <br />
<br />
- once again , I didn&#039;t know how much I&#039;ve talk about it in this review but man , they literally treat this arc like it was their first ever mission together . and the so called romantic scene that didn&#039;t even blend well together , I didn&#039;t have any kind of attachment to these characters , in any ways or whatsoever . the plot inconsistency really disturb the execution , that scene between them should&#039;ve felt more dramatic and sad . but yeah all we got was ass . <br />
<br />
-episode 11<br />
<br />
damn that fight is just Nauseated face , what happened was he waited for charl to shoot him and avoid all those bullets , but not going invisible and hide somewhere else ? I mean wtf . and the moment where charl decide to burn the ship , I mean the chameleon had a fucking good agility and vision to deny those bullets with his tail , but can&#039;t actually see the lighter which moves slower than the bullets ? wtf<br />
<br />
- and why tf alicia suddenly become the essential character here , and how tf siesta heart moves from hel to natsunagi in just one year . wtf happened here oh god . and if alicia can took over natsunagi&#039;s body , doesn&#039;t that mean siesta can do the same ? and why natsunagi only remember about siesta while alicia is somewhere in there too ?<br />
<br />
- final episode <br />
<br />
- yeah as usual , with their cringy conversation while fighting that monster . at this point I can&#039;t complain about anything anymore . all my frustration were left on the previous weekly review . so yeah that&#039;s it , one of the worst show this year , just next to ex arm . finally it&#039;s going to an end . praise the god for making me watching this without punching my laptop screen . <br />

    Welcome to Tantei Wa Mou Shindeiru, also known as BAD COPY of Bunnygirl senpai. It&#039;s actually so obvious that they tried so hard to copy the relationship between Mai and Sakuta, it&#039;s insane. <br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
<br />
The story starts off with a 50 minute long episode, which practically shows us how Siesta and Kimizuka met on a plane that has been hijacked. Somehow, Siesta has been able to get a huge freaking GUN on board which is stupid since they didn&#039;t even explain how she got it in. Everything after that is generic, extremely predictable and boring to watch, I don&#039;t even know how I managed to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412008">
        watch 6 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 5 <br />
<br />
The art was mediocre, nothing special to comment about it.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
The sound... was just nowhere to be found. Every song and intro are absolutely boring to listen to, it&#039;s really disappointing.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2<br />
<br />
Here we go. Siesta somehow always manages to seem like she&#039;s smart in the show, except that she&#039;s really not. She always engages into stupid monologues that make 0 fucking sense, and in some magic way it always works in her favor. Except that, her behavior towards the main character is an obvious copy of Mai Sakurajima (Bunnygirl Senpai) which makes her even more predictable and annoying. The main character is obnoxiously boring, just another &quot;smart&quot; person and a copy of Sakuta. Nagisa is the nearest thing to an interesting character (just barely).<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
<br />
I usually give an anime shows like 8 episodes before I drop them, but this show was just unbearable to watch. It got extremely boring after the first 3 episodes, I felt like a hero for watching 3 more. If you are here to watch trash, then go ahead, this is your thing. <br />

    A reminder that a waifu character alone is not enough to carry a show, especially if she&#039;s already dead. This is a Frankenstein anime made of a convoluted mix of tropes: harem, mechas, tentacles, werewolves, aliens, terrorists, you name it.<br />
<br />
This anime did everything it could to call attention to it: white-haired waifu bait, a few seconds of high quality animation in episode 1, vtubers cameos, character designs that look stolen from &#039;Date a Live&#039; and harem merchandise marketing, but after it got the attention it wanted, it was an utterly disappointment since it didn&#039;t have anything to stand on its own.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mystery&quot; consist of characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417290">
        saying that they &quot;knew it all along&quot; without providing any logic explanation to the viewer. The &quot;comedy&quot; consist of cringe &quot;quippy&quot; lines from the male MC, who is a middle schooler that somehow looks and acts like a salary man and doesn&#039;t change physically despite going through 4 years of puberty.<br />
<br />
Characters are devoid of personality and sometimes even their basic reason for existing in the story is not clear. Female characters are harem fillers, enemy characters are dumber than a videogame set on &quot;super easy&quot; mode and the overall plot is full of contrived and absurd developments.<br />
<br />
This anime may be a good watch for those who want to analyze a case study on &quot;how not to write a story&quot;.

    Kadokawa is a Japanese media conglomerate founded in 1945. <br />
<br />
And it is the bane of my existence.<br />
<br />
Imagine this: in the leadup to your anime, you have to promote your show. Someone comes up with a brilliant idea: “let’s confuse them so much, they’ll HAVE to watch the show!” And what’s more, this idea actually fits with the themes of the story! And so, all the PR staff put their heads together and come up with an intriguing, faithful, and popular marketing campaign that garners eyes from all over. <br />
<br />
People are constantly speculating, discussing, and spreading the word about your adaptation! Bloody brilliant! The PR team’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417283">
        done its job, and a spectacular one at that. All you have to do now is execute even a HALF-decent adaptation and you’ll get a respectable number of BD/merch sales, possibly even enough to cover production costs. NOTHING can possibly go wrong. <br />
<br />
Oh, wait. <br />
<br />
There are a number of issues with your show. Subpar direction. Atrocious animation -- apart from one sakuga sequence in episode 1 by Hashimoto Ryuuki. Barely functional backgrounds. A disjointed story. How?<br />
<br />
Well, your answer lies with 株式会社KADOKAWA -  not Studio ENGI, as I, and many others, may be inclined to believe. Shall we begin?<br />
<br />
Earlier this year, during KADOKAWA’s FY2020 report, the company outlined plans to ramp up anime production to 40 per year. 40. Per. Year. From. One. Company. It’s an obviously unsustainable plan - the industry in its CURRENT state is chock-full of production bottlenecks, overwork, and thin profit margins (if any at all). It didn’t bode well for anime as a medium. And Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru. (Tanmoshi) is case in point. <br />
<br />
Tanmoshi entered production in LATE 2020. FOR A JULY 2021 PREMIERE. To illustrate how absolutely absurd that is, in an absolute time crunch, a studio may be able to produce a fully-animated episode of an anime in five weeks. (That’s an incredibly unrealistic pace for even just one good episode, let alone an entire cour, but we’ll let it slide.) Tanmoshi has approximately 13 episodes worth of animation material (the first episode premiered with 50 minutes - which in itself was a terrible decision that I’ll get to later). <br />
<br />
So, doing some very simple mathematics with some very unrealistic benefit of the doubt, 13*5 comes out to 65 weeks for Tanmoshi to be a fully finished product with regard to animation. Assuming a July 1 production start date - again, being very generous here - that’s STILL ONLY 52 WEEKS AND SOME CHANGE. Oh and, of course not accounting for national holidays like Obon in September of 2020. So - that’s a whole 13 WEEKS shaved off the schedule. Which, again, for those of us who have forgotten our times tables, is TWENTY. GODDAMN. PERCENT. With this, inevitably, comes outsourcing. And said outsourcing did not perform well. Which is not out of the norm. So, uh, no surprise that the anime really struggles on the production value side of things. <br />
<br />
You may be wondering, what does Kadokawa have to do with this? Well - as the owners of the rights to Tanmoshi, it’s Kadokawa who both choose a time to approach a studio AND who largely dictate when an anime will premiere. THEY foisted this timeline upon ENGI. Logically, the next question would be “why didn’t ENGI simply reject the project?” <br />
<br />
Well… they couldn’t. Kadokawa is the majority stakeholder of ENGI. ENGI is beholden to Kadokawa. It’s likely that no other studio could handle such a fantastical contract, and so it was dumped upon the youngling ENGI - who, by the way, don’t have the greatest track record when it comes to their anime. <br />
<br />
All this begs the question, “how is this remotely beneficial for Kadokawa?” Easy: as a publishing company first and foremost, Kadokawa couldn&#039;t care less about studios, anime as medium, or adaptations. Their first and predominant priority is the promotion of source sales - the light novels, in this case. Anything else is a bonus. Which means, the adaptation did its job. The light novel has skyrocketed in Oricon sales rankings, with all five volumes out currently in the top 20. (The light novels are GOOD.)<br />
<br />
Thus, most of this train wreck of anime can be wholly attributed to Kadokawa -- ENGI really just needed more time. <br />
<br />
I say most, because while I addressed the categories of Art and Sound (all of the production value related stuff), I have yet to consider the merits of the story. As a diehard fan of the source, I have my prejudices here - but they probably won’t matter. This is an objectively trash adaptation story-wise, too. <br />
<br />
Remember that 50-minute premiere episode I said I was going to get to? We’ve just gotten to it. A terrible decision to start the cour off. What the anime did was take a coherent story - and rearrange events in the timeline to the point where the intrigue, the charm, the suspense - all vanished. It took a well-developed but mysterious Siesta and inappropriately (in the context of the story) contrasted it to the seemingly 2D, bland Natsunagi. The characters didn’t work with the flow of the story. In essence, it made episode 1 work better than it should have had it kept a normal length and stuck to the story - but in relation to the rest of the show, IT DIDN’T MAKE SENSE. <br />
<br />
The story jumped from setting to setting, seemingly with no distinction to the development of any character, and left plotlines hanging unresolved until a later point with a dissatisfactory conclusion supported by a lack of exposition and storytelling. <br />
<br />
There were hints of the source’s brilliance and of passion/competency on the part of the staff throughout Tanmoshi. Episodes 1 and 4, episodes 8 and 10, they were tolerable, acceptable, even, in many aspects. But that isn’t enough to salvage a show. It simply isn’t. If you’re considering getting into this show, may I suggest the light novel? Because otherwise, the show isn’t worth your time. <br />
<br />
2/10.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Kadokawa. <br />

    Mystery, arguably the most eye catching and mind straining genre to experience in any medium. Seeing a case slowly unwrap itself, while you follow along and make your own conclusions is thrilling. Or if you’re as dumb as me, you have no clue what’s going on and just wait to get amazed by the big reveal. With timeless classics such as Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet, and The Moonstone to more modern cinematography pieces such as Will Smiths Bright or Id: ‘Invaded (pls watch this, its so good) the genre has cemented itself as an integral part in the media business. A good detective

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417277">
        show is made upon an intriguing yet overwhelmingly convoluting plot with sharp witted, intelligent yet charismatic characters. Unfortunately this show has none of this.<br />
<br />
The plot if you could call it that, is like something out of a kid’s fantasy. The mc is a crisis magnet. He finds himself in various troubles against his will. One day he gets kidnaped by a group of unknown people and put on a plane where he is saved by a white haired girl who’s apparently a detective, who then decides to make the guy his partner and he accepts. What…?<br />
You could already see some absurd flaws in this plot. What normal high school going teenager gets kidnaped for no reason. It’s absurd and so ungrounded from reality that it’s almost hilarious. Our mc gets saved by the detective. Now normally detectives don’t go around fighting crime like batman. They’re the brains of the operation, they approach the case with intellect, find clues, connect the dots and figure out the criminal who’s then dealt with by law enforcements. But out waifu detective goes against every trope that makes a good detective as she becomes the person to rescue him. She then offers him to join her in her journey. Any person with half a working brain cell will say “NO”. The mcs a self-aware trouble magnet, the last thing he needs is more trouble. The logical decision would be to steer clear of people with shady jobs. But guess what, he said yes, why wouldn’t he.<br />
So we see Batman and Robin go and solve crimes together. It’s unnatural and downright unrealistic to see a high school student adapt this quickly to the life of a detective let alone be going around solving major criminal cases. Then we see the untimely death of the detective, which results in their journey coming to a close. The End…or I hoped it ended.<br />
<br />
We see our mc go back to his normal life, cause that’s natural innit? One day you’re a detective fighting mafias, next day your back to being a high school student. He then meets many different girls, which already cements the fact that this show is gunna take a harem route, so all indications of a good detective show is thrown out the window. Instead we get this horrible, time-lapse of past and present. The formula doesn’t work, one episode he is talking to a couple of girls who are linked to a crime organization or something, the next episode the guys mourning Siestas death. It then shifts to the mc and Siestas journey 3 years ago as they travel the world solving crimes. The storytelling is horrible on the same level as Peach Boy Riverside, if not worse. This absurd changing of pace out of the blue doesn’t work. It’s a real emersion breaker, and makes an already nonsensical plot even more convoluted. The plot twists in this shows are horrible to the point they don’t make sense. They went with the whole Higurashi approach of showing major events before setting up the whole premise, except unlike Higurashi it just doesn’t click. It would have been better if his past with Siestas was just vaguely introduced in the first episode, and we uncovered more and more details as the episodes went on.<br />
<br />
The plot is pure nonsensical mess. A detective show is meant to give you clues as you piece them together to find the truth hidden behind a curtain. The whole objective is to get you to think, make a conclusion by yourself before the big reveal, or add some misdirection’s in the plot to add an element of surprise when the culprit is eventually revealed.  This show goes against all the tropes by either having completely absurd revelations or not revealing them at all. You spend your time wondering why something’s happening, and the show instead of slowly revealing the answer to you, drops a complete bomb shell out of nowhere. The whole mystery aspect of the show gets so absurd, to the point you just don’t care anymore. To call it a detective show is honestly an insult to an actually good detective show.<br />
<br />
The main characters being the guy (forgot his name) and Siesta, dont go against the classic anime mc troupes. Siestas a big tiddy anime waifu. She’s the main attraction of the show and is probably the only reason this show was watched to begin with. She bares a striking resemblance to Origami from Date A Live, but nearly not as amusing to watch. She’s super generic and is personally the only likeable character of the show. Not because she’s over filled with a super charming and charismatic personality that makes you curious to see her journey through, more cause…well you already know. She’s a huge tension breaker. Whenever a serious situation arises she already knows what’s going to happen. How you ask? Who knows, it’s never explained. She’s purely set up for fan service. If the camera isn’t trying to show her cleavage or go up her skirt every 20 secs, she will start flirting with the mc to remind you that there’s obvious romantic chemistry between them, which is completely disemboweled due to the super awkward and cringy character interactions. Personal bias, I have a ting for white haired waifus (Teletha Testarossa supremacy), so to me she’s 10/10 absolute perfection.<br />
<br />
The mc, is as tasteless as plain rice, no that’s honestly an insult to rice. He’s flavorless, bland and all around super boring. From the initial depictions you can’t tell if this guy has yet to reach puberty or has a family of 4 with a mortgage. I can only describe him as the weird half-brother of Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai. They’re both emotionless to the point they get extremely unlikeable. There’s no hint of charisma or quirkiness in the guy. His overtly mature personality is super boring. He has banter with all the side girls, but that’s the extent you’ll see him somewhat act like a human, and not a complete vegetable.<br />
<br />
The side characters are forgettable. They are there for the sake of being there, and the shows fully aware of it to the point that there left completely redundant, both plot and animation wise. They’re super unmemorable, and nothing about any of them sticks out.<br />
<br />
The detective isn’t the only thing that died….the animation died with her. The show nosedives when it comes to quality. The animation goes from being acceptable and bright in episode one to all characters besides the two mc, looking like the weird doll villain out of Resident Evil 8. Where did the budget go studio? Clearly not towards the plot cause that’s still horrendous. If there isn’t enough resources to even properly animate the side characters who have recurring appearances in the show, you can only imagine how horrible the other parts of the show might look. If you’re thinking that the animation can act as a saving grace from the horrendous plot, Im sorry to say but you’ll be extremely disappointed.<br />
<br />
The best I could describe this show would be a parody of detective shows. Like a shitty movie created by middle schooler’s for their drama class. It’s not even a “so bad its good kind” of show, it’s honestly just bad. The plot is a mess, I feel like I’ve repeated that sentence about 50 times and still haven’t properly expressed how awful the plot is. They go against every core elements of a good detective show. An intriguing case, a witty, charismatic yet determined and serious when the situation arises kind of detective, a slow paced plot where they leisurely reveal certain clues so you could form a theory of your own as your follow along the story, an element of surprise while revealing the culprit or critical plot points, and a completely wrapped up, fully explored ending. None of these criteria’s are ticked. Instead they went with the classic route of adding a harem into everything. The whole detective aspect in the show is nonexistent, and seems more like Clickbait than anything. Save yourself 4 hours of your life and do anything else rather than watching this show. If you want to watch a good mystery show, I highly recommend Monster, Mushishi, Great Pretender, Id Invaded or any of the Kara no Kyoukai movies. They’re all better, intriguing and overwhelming shows and more worth watching than this dumpster fire.

    This seasons most anticipated Non sequel and it certainly does not disappoint,<br />
<br />
<br />
The first episode was a 1 hour special. The beginning of the story has all the shounen success mantra elements: a MC who is a little special but not at the same time and his ability to be involved in a mess all the time. Then we get introduced to the main heroine ,<br />
<br />
<br />
This is where it gets interesting THe whole story depends on how likable they can make siesta and this is where the decision of a 1hour special really paid off , They were able to make us all adore siesta by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409862">
        unbelievable degree the likes of which we don&#039;t see even in romance anime , then we see a easy movie budget level of animation and fight scene where we are introduced to some sci-fi robo warfare shit start expecting yeah this has to be one delusional Hormone driven shounen anime and it almost feel like one due to the very very amazing animation (prolly the best this season so far). But then they dropped the you guessed it “The detective is already dead” And there it is easily the most powerful debut episode in this season of anime<br />
<br />
If you like back and forth between MC and Female MC , you know the likes of which we see in oregairu or bunny girl senpai? We all love that since its equal terms conversation unlike most  Hormone driven anime it is witty and on point .<br />
<br />
Ah yes , stats time ,<br />
The characters are funny and have realistic and believable dialogues , the story gets interesting and is an absolute dig for sci-fi fans, the art and animation is probably the best this season . And about the Voice acting , they made a really good choice for the VA of siesta. She is adorable when she even lets out only a sneeze and the male MC VA being a close resemblence of the practical and monologue filled hachiman .<br />
<br />
Just watch the First special episode if it does not leave you begging for more by the end of it, drop it because honestly what follows is mostly more of the first with just the detective being dead .<br />

    Ok, so I do understand the negative reviews. This anime had some rather glaring issues at times. I think if you take this anime as a whole it is actually quite good.<br />
<br />
!SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />
<br />
Story- 9/10<br />
I thought this idea of a story was very unique. Having one of the main characters die so soon was very intriguing from the start of the show. The story really drew me in with how they had dual timelines throughout the twelve episodes. Flipping back and forth from present day and the past was actually done quite well. The episodes flowed one after another in great synchronization. I don&#039;t think they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417316">
        skipped a beat at all and the idea of Siesta living through her donated organs was also very unique and done well. I liked how they introduced the new characters in the show who had her organs and wanted to help our main male lead. The growing relationship between the new characters and the dissolving prior relationship of Siesta and Kimizuka stirred up some emotions in me. I do think that continuing the story would be unnecessary. I like how things were tied off in the end. It ended on a very positive note that kinda spoke to me saying &quot;No matter what sad things happen, life must go on.&quot; <br />
<br />
-Negatives= They never really explained what the whole deal was of Siesta and how she had these super powers.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
The art was a mixed bag. Some scenes were VERY sloppily done. So much so that I thought in one episode that the web player had downgraded the resolution of the video. However, some scenes did look great. To be specific, I really liked the scene of the final conversation between siesta and nagisa. I thought they did a good job there. Overall, it was lackluster.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
This anime did what a lot of anime have done in more recent times. That is, they included some great songs in the middle of the show during emotional moments. I thought it really added to the scenes and my resulting emotions at viewing it. <br />
<br />
Character 9/10<br />
I really liked the characters of the show. They had strong characters who displayed resiliency, empathy and sound logic. I often dislike the shows that showcase main leads who are wimpy and whiney. I think the characters showcase qualities everyone should aspire to. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
This show had me excited to watch it every week. I thought that keeping it short and sweet in 12 episodes was a key to my enjoyment. I dislike anime that drag things on and on with lengthy seasons. This story had a strong start, slightly weaker middle, and strong end. <br />
<br />
Overall 8/10<br />
Some loose strings were left untied. I can say I enjoyed this show and felt it deserves a rating of very good. It had a unique storyline, Great characters, good music placement and song choices in general. I would really only recommend this show to those who like romance. The romance is strong in this one. Overall, a memorable experience.<br />

    I think this is one of the worst anime I ever watched. I tried not to spoil anything important that isn&#039;t in the first episode.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty mediocre. In the first episode, the fight scene was great and it was overall good. All the episodes since have been lazy, the characters look off-model half of the time and it ruins the &quot;waifu-esque&quot; designs. I feel like the first episode was just bait and animation to use for trailers. In the later episodes, there is a chase scene between a mecha and a giant monster, great action right ? No, this was so boring, one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415347">
        dimensional, there was no effort put into it.<br />
The sound is forgettable, the op is generic and I can&#039;t even remember one background soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Now one of the real problems is the characters. Siesta is the only one I can even call a character, she has a personality, motivations (weak but still better than the others) and even if she isn&#039;t the greatest, at least there is SOMETHING. The others are the blandest cliché, the MC just follows the plot and Siesta, I can&#039;t tell a single thing about him except &quot;he looks like a blasé salaryman&quot;, Nagisa is a tsundere with oppai and...she follows him because of plot. (There is a reason but this is so stupid and also, spoiler). The idol one has a nice chara-design but the animation doesn&#039;t help it and except &quot;she&#039;s an idol&quot; and &quot;she&#039;s rich&quot; there isn&#039;t much going on, they tried to make her &quot;complex&quot; with some lies and kinda manipulation but...it doesn&#039;t go anywhere and it was pretty much nonsensical, I just seemed to me they tried way to hard to appear smart and complex with her. <br />
<br />
And last but not least, the plot : it doesn&#039;t make any sense and it&#039;s getting more and more ridicule. I&#039;m always asking myself...WHY ? Why is Siesta a detective ? &quot;Because justice&quot;...okay, but why ? Why pretending this is cyborg bullshit ? There is a werewolf who can shapeshift in a episode and the only justification is &quot;he has a cyborg nose&quot;. Just call it magic, this is much less confusing. There is also a big and evil corporation who does evil things &#039;cause...evil I guess, I still don&#039;t have a clue. <br />
Siesta has a magical rifle that shoot bullets of her own blood to make people obey her, great but...how ? And why doesn&#039;t she use it after the first episode ? Everything is explained by cyborg body parts and nothing makes sense.<br />
&quot;The detective is already dead&quot; was the part I was the most interested in, that&#039;s a bold choice, it could make great narration and an kinda original story I thought. But the show makes a big timeskip and then lots of flashbacks, how is the detective supposed to fell dead if I see her every episodes ? Maybe it is grief because the character still &quot;see&quot; her everywhere, maybe I&#039;m giving it too much credit. <br />
<br />
To conclude, because I&#039;m getting salty, it has potential and didn&#039;t make anything good with it. The production isn&#039;t bad, the plot is the main flaw with the characters. <br />
BUT I do recommend watching it because this is one of the best unintentional comedy I have seen so far !

    What about &quot;detective&quot; aspect of this show?<br />
Expect some trash middle schooler fanfic about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson being a middle schooler and a hot chick with supernatural abilities fighting supernatural mutants.<br />
<br />
The whole detective aspect of the show is the hot chick knowing everything about a particular character without explaining how she knows.<br />
In the very first episode it becomes utterly ridiculous on the level<br />
&quot;You are this and that&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, but actually you are that and this&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, how did you know this as well.... But I&#039;m actually rather that&quot;<br />
&quot;I knew it&quot; <br />
The revelations go on, totally not caring that every new revelation cancels the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413174">
        genius guess that was made before.<br />
<br />
What about the romantic aspect of the show?<br />
Expect the same middle schooler level fantasy of a super girl begging some random &quot;bland bitch protagonist&quot; (tm) to live together, travel the world together and do superhero stuff together at her expense, and she is ready to beg wearing nothing but a bath towel. <br />
Why? Because he is so special and unique (there is nothing special in him that warrants this behavior except being rather unlucky).<br />
<br />
The supergirl orchestrates all adventures in &quot;80 days around the world&quot; style, with the series of the chained highly unlikely events, like it is some kind of &quot;plan&quot; which eventually totally comes together because of course, of course.

    Basically, another shitty anime that got hype because of cute girls...<br />
<br />
Writing my first review just to shit on this anime.<br />
It&#039;s a story about so called &quot;LegEnDaRy dEteCtive&quot; which gets mentioned like every 5 seconds which makes you question if life is worth living.. *sigh*<br />
As a mystery/detective story lover it&#039;s a disgrace that leaves bad taste in my mouth. They even had the audacity to mention Baker Street smh<br />
<br />
&quot;This is absurd.&quot; - MC&#039;s quote describes the Plot so well. There is no logic or reasoning much less any deducing or solving mysteries from anime with &quot;detective&quot; in its title. Story, pacing, timeline... everything is all over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417452">
        the place but the worst thing is this anime takes its self seriously which makes it 100x worse.<br />
<br />
Bad story aside the conversations are dry as a desert with forced monologues and fake emotions. There is no chemistry or charm to these 1-dimensional characters as much as this anime wants you to believe.<br />
<br />
Overall only thing that&#039;s going for it is the Art style and Animations which immediately loses its value when characters talk over them like shut your damn mouth for 20 minutes, please.<br />

    &quot;The Detective is Already Dead&quot;? More like:<br />
&quot;The Story/Plot is Simple-mindedly Predictable (on the back of our heads)&quot;;<br />
&quot;The Characters are Absurdly Boring (and one-sided)&quot;;<br />
&quot;The Animation (or rather the production) went from Heroic Sakuga to Zero&quot;;<br />
&quot;The Music is somewhat Decent&quot;; and to sum it up:<br />
&quot;The Anime is Already Doomed (after the double-length Episode 1, which was all style but no substance)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Being one of the most hyped (that&#039;s mostly from word-of-mouth from light novel readers) that in a bizarre turn of events, turned to one of the most disappointing shows of the derisory state of the Summer 2021 season, I&#039;m sure that novelist Nigojuu had an idea of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417274">
        doing a work that he so desired to make, and it was deemed good in its written form. But aside from the naming convention that sounds like a clear reference to Hokuto no Ken&#039;s Kenshiro&#039;s famous catchphrase, and as &quot;smart&quot; as the anime wants us to believe it does, &quot;Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.&quot; is a work that for the life of me (and many others) just couldn&#039;t seem to wrap around what it&#039;s trying to be.<br />
<br />
Nigojūu&#039;s biography is far more interesting than his work, not gonna lie, and for real. You can read it on Wikipedia, but the TL;DR is this: this guy, during his university days, was influenced by Oreimo so much that he wrote some light novels, only to be met with disappointment. Years later with the release of Saekano, he took part in Comiket events, formed a Doujin circle and dedicated most of his time into writing light novels and responding to open calls when competitions arose, and this work won the grand prize for Media Factory&#039;s 15th MJ Bunko J Light Novel Newcomer Award in 2019, which simultaneously started serializing in November of that same year. Nigojū&#039;s influences when creating Tanmoshi (the short nickname of this work) are from Oreimo, Saekano and even Oregairu, which these 3 are romance light novels, and IMO, it&#039;s heavily influenced as the anime had showed. So, blame this guy all you want if Tanmoshi felt more like the detective&#039;s harem version of BBC&#039;s Sherlock.<br />
<br />
And yes, the story/plot is just that: unknown enemies at work, detective earns a sidekick, and there it&#039;s off to solve the numerous cases of which all are linked to the usual organization ratcheting evil, how simple does that sound. The thing that makes Tanmoshi stand out is that the &quot;legendary detective&quot; Origami Tobiichi *oops, wrong character, ahem* Siesta, she is a kink of a potential waifu character that does what detectives do, but on an insane level. Dealing with shape-shifting beings from the underworld organization that is SPES, she is unstoppable in both action and wit to outwit them, even when she&#039;s already dead and has part of her organs transplanted onto others that can easily pass them off as being part of Siesta&#039;s party charade. If you were to ask me if this idea sounds fresh, it truly does feel that way. But the whole execution of the show of trying to leverage that fact of being a missionary detective class of a &quot;smart-ass&quot; case study just feels wrong on so many levels, and not to mention that there hardly isn&#039;t any kind of lore of rhyme and reason to it. Everything just screams: &quot;Since the plot device is there, why not let&#039;s use to our fullest potential, even when it looks or sounds bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you&#039;ve guessed it, that plot device is rounded through Siesta&#039;s sidekick that is the &quot;troublemaker&quot; Kimihiko Kimizuka, a guy that&#039;s born with a condition that naturally attracts him to troublesome situations. You name it, he&#039;s in all of it. Being thrown into Siesta&#039;s detective mission on a whim, starting out with Episode 1&#039;s airplane hijacking that marks the start of the conflict between Siesta and SPES, he was literally forced into her mission without parole and acted as her sidekick for that duration. It was there when he made his mind to be her sidekick (NOT a detective, mind you) in the aftermath and proceeded to spent his time with her until the series&#039; title beckons her fate. A fun fact that Kimizuka&#039;s voiced by a newbie whom only had an insignificant work to his name, and this is VA Arata Nagai&#039;s MC debut. What&#039;s surprising is that he sounds like most other veteran male VAs in the industry (something akin along the likes of Bunny Girl Senpai&#039;s Kaito Ishikawa), and for a first main role, he does the job well to give some personality to Kimizuka, because he&#039;s a largely boring character to look at. Something that I&#039;ve noticed about Kimizuka, is that he has to be constantly spoon-fed with infodump, largely because he really doesn&#039;t know what&#039;s going on during his detecive adventures with Siesta, and that&#039;s fine.<br />
<br />
But bring in the other girls that are attached to Siesta in one way or another (the weak-hearted Nagisa Natsunagi, the sapphire-eyed Chuunibyu idol Yui Saikawa, and the &quot;before Kimizuka existed&quot; assistant Charlotte Arisaka Anderson), and the show&#039;s rhythm immediately trenches akin that to a not-so-alike rom-com harem situation (that thankfully isn&#039;t a core theme of the show). Kimizuka IS supposed to take Siesta&#039;s place and rekindle his thoughts before these girls show up, but they sure took Siesta&#039;s position and made him look like the joker fool of a sidekick once again. I get it that Kimizuka&#039;s supposed to push the plot forward, but the incoherent storytelling that makes even lesser sense as the series progresses is its Achilles&#039; Heel, so much that I gave up trying to analyze what could happen (as if the predictabilities aren&#039;t that obvious enough). Looking back on the influences of Oreimo, Saekano and Oregairu, the one thing that Nigojūu tried to do was to stand out in the least blatant way possible, but these influences (I&#039;d reckon) got to his head too much that sometimes he sacrificed the story for characterization, which for a comparison, is the worst of the 3. Not everyone can be Kyosuke Kosaka, Tomoya Aki or Hachiman Hikigaya, and Kimizuka is almost completely devoid of his own instinctual humanity to act on his own behalf. A good character being dependent of, but not independently.<br />
<br />
Making things worse is how Tanmoshi was marketed to increase the hype for both light novel readers and anime-onlies. For one, some of the promotional visuals released had both the original and &quot;true&quot; versions (which I know that not a lot of people would&#039;ve even paid close attention in the first place). How this goes is that the original visual would be released first, then once the episodes relating to them had finished airing, the &quot;true&quot; visual would be released. It&#039;s not really a spoiler since it basically spoils the final product of the character arcs, and then again, it&#039;s a reference that only if you&#039;ve watched the anime and went back to the visual, then it paints the difference. Also, a double-length episode is almost set and guaranteed to fail because of content that is hamfisted to give the audience some &quot;perks&quot; of its story to give it a great first impression (see this season&#039;s Bokutachi no Remake), only to be faced with the slow intake of brewing disappointment. It almost felt like that the studio behind this (ENGI) wanted to give a good proposition, so they went all out in the production to give an amazing Sakuga Episode 1 for all of us to be wowed. Sadly, being a studio that&#039;s tied to it&#039;s parent compaany Kadokawa (which this series is serialized under), after that inital episode, it completely burned out slowly but surely, and you can feel that creeping up when you least expected it. Heck, they even got Hololive&#039;s Shirakami Fubuki and Natsuiro Matsuri to be a cameo in an episode, so I can only commend on how hard the production team must&#039;ve tried to drive the show&#039;s momentum. All of this begs the sole question: &quot;So what&#039;s the point in all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
If anything, the music&#039;s decent enough with at least a good OP and a decent ED. The OST which also tries hard to make it sound like an American or Japanese live-action themed detective show just...feels out of place, and is something that tries to push the envelope that it grates on my nerves quite a fair bit.<br />
<br />
It pains me to say that Tanmoshi could be a lot more better if it knows how to balance between its slice-of-life and true detective moments in a coherent manner, because majority of the people who watch anime aren&#039;t deep thinkers, and they would pretty much prefer a tried-and-true detective show like Yuukoku no Moriarty a.k.a Moriarty the Patriot, which goes deep into the detective lore, making it a compelling watch. That said, I highly recommend you go and read the light novel, even if the storytelling&#039;s just as bad (or good, according to your tastes), but at least like your favorite fiction book, you will never stop wanting to read it to the end.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Skip the anime, go for the light novel.

    This show started out strong, with a good double length first episode, good looking characters and an intriguing premise ... and then it nosedived like nothing else. The only thing I can think of to compare it to is GoT series 8.<br />
<br />
The art looked beautiful and episode 1 seemed to race along, with the mysterious detective Siesta taking our MC (who is apparently at school but you&#039;d never guess from the look of the character) along on a real roller coaster ride.<br />
<br />
In subsequent episodes we have an abrupt change of pace, the MC is now mourning the death of Siesta 3 years later and we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review415646">
        get a moderately engaging plot about a couple of girls which is linked to the organisation Siesta was investigating in episode 1, okay so far.<br />
<br />
Then we abandon the new characters to go back to what happened in the three years the MC was with Siesta. Not only is another change of focus jarring but the quality is dropping too. The characters are still nicely drawn, but the scenes seem to be becoming devoid of detail other than the main cast. The voice acting is coming across as bland and lifeless, the story beats are peculiarly meandering.<br />
<br />
Why are visiting these places? How does Siesta know anything? Where did that giant mech come from? Who is this new girl? *shrug* It&#039;s a mystery, but not a good sort of mystery where there is a logical progression and a feeling of getting glimpses of something behind a curtain, more a series of deus-ex reveals whose lack of coherence prevents you from taking any satisfaction in the reveal - because there are no clues at all for you to make any inference from. How are you supposed to know that the bad guys have mutants and mech suits in a base under London? Beats me, but Siesta apparently knew. How? I don&#039;t know. A good mystery gives you clues and gets you guessing before it lets you in on the secret, maybe it throws in some misdirection can it can surprise you, it introduces a cast of suspects and scatters crumbs for you to puzzle over.<br />
<br />
Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru does none of this. It just throws one bizarre reveal after another at you until... I just don&#039;t care anymore. I literally just watched the detective die and I was totally unmoved. I repeat: I just watched the emotional peak of the series and it left me cold. The romance was over already, I don&#039;t care about the characters anymore and I can&#039;t be bothered to puzzle over the plot.<br />
<br />
My advice is to maybe watch some of this. Ep 1 is probably a 7 or 8. Episodes 2-4 maybe a 6 or 7. The rest will probably be better in your own imagination.
