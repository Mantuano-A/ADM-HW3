    Yet again, Studio Pierrot has bent the anime community over and fucked us...<br />
<br />
Art/Sound: <br />
The art and animation is basic with most of the action being goddamn slideshows essentially, it just doesn&#039;t reflect the manga&#039;s great art. However, the sound is actually good in general, especially the OP by TK and the voice acting.<br />
<br />
Plot/Character:<br />
120 chapters in 12 episodes... THERE IS NO FUCKING PLOT! I have read a bit of the manga and I&#039;m still lost; it&#039;s too fast and we get no explanations or understanding of what&#039;s going on. Due to this pacing, all the characters that have been thrown at us get NO development although

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292996">
        they seem cool and you really want to understand them. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Honestly, I&#039;ve given up on tokyo ghoul as an anime; it needs the brotherhood treatment badly. It baffles me how people are giving this shit 10/10s and 9/10s, I can&#039;t imagine how deluded they must be, this deserves a 5/10 at max! Please, do yourself a favor and read the manga.

    So, to preface, this is my first review, so bear with me here!<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed this anime, good! That means you got something out of it that I couldn&#039;t! But I, for one, didn&#039;t! So, with that said, let&#039;s get into it, shall we? Tokyo Ghoul:RE is.... Quite an atrocious anime. You&#039;ve probably heard this a 1000 times by now, and so I&#039;ll be the 1001st.. Never have I been so disgusted with a form of media until now. Save yourself, and don&#039;t waste your time with this.<br />
<br />
Story - 4<br />
<br />
The story of this season is overall pretty dry and flavorless. These arcs are just not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296802">
        very good. Period. I thought this was the case in the manga, as well. After a CERTAIN MAJOR INDIVIDUAL&#039;S PASSING, the quality in story just drops. Every theme TG wished to take on just seems to loosely hang on as everything is dragged away by the boring narrative. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, the hundreds of scenes that were just flat out REMOVED from the anime to make room. These scenes, believe it or not, are kind of important, and are needed to progress the story properly. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure Funimation needed to start a weekly podcast to EXPLAIN what was going on in this series. THAT&#039;S when you know you REEEEALLY messed it up.<br />
<br />
Art - 1<br />
<br />
This is the worst part of it all. I would rather watch a 5 year old&#039;s slideshow on microsoft powerpoint than sit through this again. The artstyle is generic, the animation is static, and everything is colorless. It&#039;s appalling to the eyes. <br />
<br />
There are more still frame shots in this series than anything else, and that, in my opinion at least, is a really big shame. I&#039;m still hoping for another studio to pick up this series and do a reboot, because Pierrot obviously did NOT do it justice.<br />
<br />
The fight scenes are the most horrid examples of this. It&#039;s always just slideshows. It&#039;s all just lazy.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
The sound WOULD be the strong part of the anime, considering the soundtrack for this series was beautiful and actually felt appropriate for the series, but.... One issue.<br />
<br />
No new tracks were written for this season, and the studio kept reusing the same tracks over and over and over and over. Needless to say, it&#039;s more redundant that water torture.<br />
<br />
Character - 4<br />
<br />
The characters in the TG manga were the strong spot. And so, believe it or not, when you take away everything that makes a character believable, relate-able, and interesting, you get generic stick figures that no one cares for. And that&#039;s just what this studio did. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go into detail, for that would be entering spoiler territory, but in short, all the characters had a majority of their traits, backstory, and justifications removed. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 1 <br />
<br />
I hated this anime, if you can&#039;t tell already. To say I didn&#039;t enjoy ANY of it would be a lie, however. I liked the opening theme by TK and a few of the tracks on the OST (before they got so stale to me I couldn&#039;t stand them, of course) but that&#039;s pretty much it. From the animation to the poor story telling.... All of it is just a big loss. I would actually sit there during each episode, looking at the time and saying to myself, &quot;Is it over yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall - 1<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pathetic. I&#039;ve listed all my reasons as to why I think this. I&#039;m not gonna preach high and mighty about the manga, it has flaws too, but if you want to enjoy this series, read the manga. That&#039;s all I need to say about it. <br />
<br />
And again, if you somehow enjoyed this heaping pile of trash, good on you!

    This review will cover both Seasons of Tokyo Ghoul re:<br />
<br />
&quot;YA DONE FUCKED IT UP&quot;<br />
Angry Joe.<br />
<br />
Back in the summer 14 anime season, there was a little star anime called Tokyo Ghoul. After that first season ended the series quickly gained popularity from anime fans from the world making it the success. While manga fans beg the differ around due to its content skipping the first season was a decent adaptation that did a good job at bringing in anime only fans to Sui Ishida work.<br />
<br />
One anime season later the second season of Tokyo Ghoul came out which was titled Tokyo Ghoul Root A a confusing, poorly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296874">
        animated and horrendously adapted train wreck not only saddened the anime-only fans but pissed a huge chunk of manga fans. When I finished Root A. Tokyo Ghoul Root A was so bad it killed off a big chunk of the anime fanbase for the series where they all decided to read the manga which while reading it they opinions of the anime drastically changed for the worst where people my self-included no longer consider even the decently handle first season to be good.<br />
<br />
Now fast forward 3 years later we have the Tokyo Ghoul re anime adaptation and let&#039;s just say that this show was dead on arrival.<br />
<br />
Am not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is one of the worst animes ever made because not only this show is an absolute failure a manga adaptation but it&#039;s also a failure of an anime product to a point where simply doesn&#039;t function correctly and trust me when I say this that nothing more infuriating than an anime that doesn&#039;t function at all.<br />
<br />
With that said let&#039;s begin with this broken butchered feast.<br />
<br />
Uhh, there are so many things wrong with the story alone I seriously don&#039;t know where to begin and even then talking about this shows problems gives me physical pain. I honestly cannot believe of how awful this series and with that said let&#039;s start talking about this dreadful story.<br />
<br />
One of the first mistakes that Tokyo Ghoul re was how the plot presented itself to the viewer. Instead of getting a half recap episode where it shows us showcases the Kaneki vs Arima you know the fight that was non-existent in Root A the show decided to jump to straight to the action while horrendously introducing its new characters.<br />
<br />
I understand that Studio Pierrot wanted to get straight to the action and all but there should be least some decent transition piece from original series to re: This is just straight up ADHD pandering and this poor transition piece alone really highlights how poorly directed this series is especially re:S2 where everything goes to shit in terms of writing and dialogue. <br />
<br />
The pacing in Tokyo Ghoul re is an absolute disaster in every level. Despite this show being 24 episodes mind, you the series moves at a fast pace like a typical battle shounen the fast shounen pacing clearly doesn&#039;t work in Tokyo Ghoul re as the series was meant to be this psychological horror drama series that has a lot of chararter and story building. Not this broken ass shounen series that completely butchers everything that the original series has set off.<br />
<br />
The final nail of the coffin for this broken mess is the direction. Am not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re is easily the worst directed series I have ever seen in my life. So many awkward scene transition, awful camera positioning and abysmal shot composition and framing.<br />
<br />
You may be wondering why I haven&#039;t touched the plot for Tokyo Ghoul re: Well that&#039;s because the plot is a complete lobotomised bastardisation of its own source material where all the story elements that happened in the source material have been butchered to oblivion where it no longer makes any sort of sence.<br />
<br />
The story was so horrendously broken Funimation had to go out of the way to explain the all the events of Tokyo Ghoul re on a live stream and even then they are having a hard time explaining thanks to this shows pathetic pacing and directing.<br />
<br />
Overall the story of Tokyo Ghoul re: is a complete abomination that shouldn&#039;t have seen the light of day. Screw you Studio Pierrot.<br />
<br />
The characters don&#039;t fare much better and that&#039;s the tragic part because these characters can be good but the pacing and direction completely kill these characters before they can even open them damm months. Another thing that makes the characters even worse is how the series loves to introduced new characters and like with the original series they barely left an impression in the narrative as they show once or twice then they are never seen or at times ever heard from again...<br />
<br />
Kaneki/Haiseki is a boring and inconsistent husk of a chararter. Outside of him being a broken adapted chararter to the core thanks to Studio Pierrot and the staff being the show being incompetent as hell he just boring and inconsistent edgy who does edge/nerdy thing for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
Now if you thought Touka was already useless enough in Root A you ain&#039;t seen nothing yet because apart from having set with Kaneki in S2 she literally does nothing at all. What a way to kill a chararter even harder.<br />
<br />
The Quinx Squad are all bland and uninteresting as they just exist to move this broken plot along. The same thing from Arima as well all the returning characters from the previous series.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters. Well, let&#039;s pretend I never said that because they all just appear and disappear as they please.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters in Tokyo Ghoul re were about as interesting as watching DSP Gaming Persona 3 let&#039;s play and the way the characters were treated were worse than reading a bad Naruto fanfic.<br />
<br />
Oh boy, where do I even being with this trash on a visual level? The first 2 seasons of Tokyo Ghoul did not have the best production values but both seasons at various point had some decent animation that actually worked. Tokyo Ghoul re: both seasons has none of that as it contently remanded to be a poorly animated shit show from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Studio Pierrot took very good looking art from the manga and reduced them into the muddy toilet bowl as the show at various point looked like it was drawn and coloured in freaking DeviantArt in the year 2004 and as a result, the characters designs in this show look liked dogshit.<br />
<br />
The background scenery is even worse as the show loves it uses its blacks, greys, white and dark blues for the scenery giving the show a dark, depressing feel. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t think Tokyo Ghoul re understands visuals directing because despite the show being Quote &quot;Dark&quot; the show&#039;s dialogue as well the fight scenes that scream shounen bias all over the place.<br />
The animation in Tokyo Ghoul re is somehow even worse.<br />
Saying that Tokyo Ghoul re: animation is a travesty is a fast understatement.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not kidding when I say this but Tokyo Ghoul re has the absolute worst animation I have ever seen from this decade. Yes even worse than The Master of Rock Bottom. While the animation of the master of rock bottom was a complete abomination least you can somewhat laugh at the animation on that because it was pretty hilarious at certain points.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Ghoul re has none of that, in fact, I can go as far that even hentai&#039;s are better animated than Tokyo Ghoul re: Where do I begin with this nightmare. For starters the consent still frames are out of control as scenes look like it was done in Adobe After Effects in under a day.<br />
<br />
The fight choreography is piss poor the use of budget cuts were out of hand and show is simply a poorly animated shitfeast that had no care or soul.<br />
The worst thing about the animation about Tokyo Ghoul re were the horrifying camera shake for the action scenes Holy hell I have never seen relay on camera shakes to simulate character movement in my life and I have seen The Asterisk War, and Black Clover where both of these shows abuses its camera shakes to quote simulate epic moments however, its so much worse here as unlike those two shows were they some okay animation every now and then this series feels it was animated by someone who has just learned to use Adobe After Effects.<br />
<br />
The final nail of the coffin of Tokyo Ghoul re: is the second season poster. Not only the poster is filled with massive spoilers that can annoy the viewer especially anime-only fans who haven&#039;t touched the manga but it looked it was done in Adobe Photoshop in less than an hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of Tokyo Ghoul re like with the show butchered narrative and production values is bland and uninspired. Yes, it may had some iconic track that played from the original but the show poor direction kills it as the show seemed to play them in very inappropriate scenes. The example of this happens in the last episode of season 1 as the series decided to play happy ending song while all the sad scenes were going on.<br />
<br />
Both the opening and ending themes were pretty decent for what they were but the ultimately not that memorable <br />
As for sub vs dub well let&#039;s not go there as it just as bad as a whole script and production.<br />
Never before I have seen an anime this incompetent and broken in my life.<br />
The story is a badly paced mess that with filled with asspulls and plot holes that are never explained at all to the viewer.<br />
<br />
The characters are all blander than cardboard as they are all empty shells of their manga counterparts. The production values were horrendous that is filled with trash directing, abysmal music including voicing acting was terrible. This is easily hands down the second worst anime I have ever seen period completely de-throwing The Asterisk War and Darling in the Franxx.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t seen the anime yet please do yourself a favour and read the manga and pretend the anime got the Tsukihime anime treatment.

    Mangaka: I made a sequel to the Tokyo Kushu manga, wanna read it?<br />
<br />
Me: Sure, let&#039;s see... yeah, this story is fucking awful, every single character was practically mind-raped, the art is so messy I literally can&#039;t tell what is happening during these action sequences and there is just too much text for this to be called a manga. Let&#039;s face it, this wouldn&#039;t be passing any editor&#039;s radar if the series was less popular.<br />
<br />
Studio Pierrot: *teleports behind my back* pssst, kiddo, we can easily make this thing 7 times worse, just watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s no secret that Tokyo Kushu is a problematic franchise. This for the simple

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292990">
        reason that its anime adaptations are messy to say the least. The first season stays loyal to the manga, the second is non-canon, the third one is based to a manga sequel and assuming that who ever is watching it has also read the manga since anime prequel that leads to the events seen there doesn&#039;t exist. And now when the series is for the first time ever getting some consistency with its making, the outcome is --well--  this fucking thing.<br />
<br />
The story of this sequel is impressively bland. It&#039;s so uninteresting and boring that it&#039;s not even worth of getting mad over. The whole thing relies on some supposedly fucked up society and edgy hierarchy system where the plot itself is filled with side characters that are in no way whatsoever believable and cliches so lousily written and executed that it could as well be a parody. Following the story line is hard as hell because the scenes change and story advances in such a tempo, yet nothing that happens really seems to matter because that&#039;s how the story presents itself. Half of the entire dialogue, on the other hand, could be replaced with the line &quot;because I am bully.&quot; and the series would be the exact same thing. The &quot;drama&quot; writing is so edgy and hard-try sad that I am mainly feeling disgust whenever some suicidal little girl declares their &quot;darkness&quot;.<br />
<br />
The reason why I ever found this to be good at all are the main characters. I read the whole manga just to see if ships sail, but it was still worth it for few reasons: The characters interacting with each others offers some nice chemistry. The banter is pretty fun and the character centric comedic reliefs -- that rarely are have the real focus, rather work in the background -- are cute and almost relaxing to witness at times. The whole thing with its SoL side had a real &quot;big family&quot; feel to it, and personally, I came to appreciate it for that reason. Now, whoever made this anime adaptation clearly didn&#039;t see any charm in that so instead the only thing they really are showing here is the awfully written main story and every single lackcluster of a fight scene. *yawn*... I guess. Some supposedly badass dude said: &quot;645 is the numbers of times I could have finished you off during this fight.&quot; Conveniently, I considered dropping this series the exact same amount of times during it. If the action + drama and supposed horror / psychology side of the story -- not to leave the beyond fake mystery side unmentioned -- all were replaced with nothing but (the) slice of life content, this thing would still not be &quot;good&quot; but it certainly would be better. <br />
<br />
Just to quote urbandictionary: Mind rape occurs whenever one&#039;s brain feels as though it has been assaulted viciously by some event or thing in reality. This applies to half the cast as it is. Since the setup for Kushu Re was executed with memoryloss cliches and writing equally pathetic to that, an extra effort is required to make the thing believable and to make any sense now. So what did Pierrot decide to do? To not even try! 2 cour total is enough to cover 180 chapters worth of manga, it seems. So often when I see a character do something, I wonder who is this person? I know who they are supposed to be, but what they do is just not what their character originally was or what it was developed into. Needless to say, it is not pretty to watch. The pacing of this thing easy to sum up with a meme = fast as fuck boii. The sense our story and characters make = n/a. However, what really makes no sense at all is how the anime adaptation is being dealt with by the studio. <br />
<br />
The first season had good production values no matter how it is looked. Its opening song was the biggest meme since Shingeki no Kyojin, every bit of the art and audio was used to make the series better than it would&#039;ve otherwise been. It was pretty and sounded good. Smart decisions. The second season didn&#039;t suffer from many problems considering these departments. Especially the whole scene that leads to the ending is magnificently done no matter how I look at it, production-wise, that is. This season and the 3rd are way more loyal to the awful manga art. The action scenes are almost as messy and tension-lacking as in the source material -- sometimes not even animated. There are not many things currently going in the series that I find worth of praising. The OP is fantastic tho. Tokyo Kushu has been going for worse since the beginning and there seems to be no end to that. <br />
<br />
As a person who doesn&#039;t especially like Tokyo Kushu, I did quite enjoy seeing this thing destroy itself over the years, but at this point it&#039;s not even funny anymore since it being awful has become a part of the consensus already. After episode 01, I was supposed to casually insult all teenage action anime by stating this is the exact same thing as all of them, but damn, at this point even I myself couldn&#039;t buy that statement anymore.

    I always considered scores like 1 or 2 unusable. They&#039;re just unfair in my opinion, because I believe that no matter how trashy a series can be it&#039;ll still have its own ups that are worthy of some more points at least.<br />
<br />
However, this is the one series (season in particular) that is going to make me change my mind.<br />
<br />
The amount of rubbish they packed up here; from horrible pacing, to lousy animation, to poorly developed characters, to lacking intensity, to inconsistent story that keeps jumping from one place to another incoherently, just makes anyone ignore whatever positive you can find (though I doubt you can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293004">
        find any, even sound is not so good compared to previous seasons) and make the series unwatchable overall.<br />
<br />
I just scrammed through the first 4 episodes because I had a genuine curiosity to see how they&#039;re going to handle my favorite chapters in the manga, I&#039;d say. I would like to admit, though, that I&#039;m kinda surprised by how easily they managed to outdo themselves and get worse and worse every season and every episode. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like to focus on negative aspects in the series I watch, and I rarely even write positive reviews let alone negative ones, but I&#039;m really in awe this time. This is my first 2 stars score (never gave less than 5) and will probably be my only.

    From even the very first season, I wasn&#039;t the biggest fan of the Tokyo Ghoul series in its entirety, and I’m REALLY tired of people telling me that I should be reading the manga version of the story. Regardless of whether or not I read light novel or manga versions of certain anime, it should not have that big or significant an impact on my impressions, feelings, experience, and/or analysis/critiquing of the anime adaptations themselves, because I honestly feel that the adaptations are their own things…their own piece of work or art (or at least attempts to be so, half-hearted or not). How I feel

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296784">
        about a certain adaptation’s loyalty or faithfulness to its source should not be something prioritized when making a serious judgment on it. This is personally how I feel regarding LN/manga adaptations, being an individual who prefers to be an anime-only fan and viewer, and I would only check out some of the source material for purely out of my own separate curiosity.<br />
(This review will mainly encompass TG:Re 2nd Season, but it will also involve aspects from the previous RE season as well as the first two TG seasons. Because of this, the grade given by this review may not necessarily be the same as the one I gave for this season in particular.)<br />
<br />
STORY: 1/10<br />
For starters, like with the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:Re tried to document a compelling psycho/horror story about a young man named Kaneki who treads between living as a human and living as a Ghoul, and the conflict surrounding him and the companions he made.<br />
Let’s backtrack a little bit here: the TG story itself starts off fairly decent, where it portrays the livelihood and strife of Ghouls in human society. Due to their carnivorous nature, being only able to sustain off the very species they most physically resemble, Ghouls are often the targets of countless acts of discrimination, which include, but not are limited to, law enforcement, public fear, and general hostility. Ghouls are still very much like human in terms of emotion, sociality, and just about everywhere else, except biologically; because of this, living peaceful lives is something they value (at least what the show tried to portray in the first season). This kind of setup was what Tokyo Ghoul tried to utilize to distinct itself or put itself a cut or level above the usual urban horror or semi-vampire stories out there.<br />
While the initial setup and ideas were very good on paper, the overall execution of the show was an underwhelming mess. For my perspective at least, the entire show just seemed like a redundant showcasing of material that would belong more to shounen (or shounen-esque) shows; basically, Tokyo Ghoul is practically a shounen series disguised as a beautiful-looking, one-of-a-kind psycho/horror story. The entire Tokyo Ghoul anime series also suffered from a considerable lack of exposition and details, so it fails hard in trying to make the show’s plot/narrative easier to understand. Another issue the Tokyo Ghoul anime has is its complete, utter lack of a sense of proper pacing. The pacing of the entire story, for the most part, only moves at one speed: FAST. Fast and Furious.<br />
<br />
For the TG:Re series by itself, the story is extremely incongruent with the story from the first two seasons, resulting in a complete lack of cohesiveness and siegeway. I’ll explain why.<br />
<br />
From what we should know from the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul mixed its levels of extreme violence with fleeting moments of beauty and/or emotion to demonstrate that the Ghouls are genuinely striving for normalcy amidst the atmosphere of brutality, and the struggles they go through in their attempts to achieve that ideal peaceful livelihood. The taste of coffee and the tranquility of a coffeehouse, due to Ghouls being able to at least enjoy coffee like humans do, are the sole two things that Ghouls and humans can share peacefully, so the usage of the coffeehouse in the first and second seasons as a base for the Ghouls to set up a peaceful coexistence makes so much damn sense.<br />
<br />
With the two RE seasons, most of that pretty much went out the window. Tokyo Ghoul:Re basically betrays almost everything positive that the two “OG” seasons tried to use, abandoning the storytelling elements altogether. Tokyo Ghoul:Re, as a story, doesn’t seem to really know what it’s doing or where it’s going, as it bounces between several different points of ongoing conflict as well as foregoing any necessary content that would act as important transitions or siegeways. Thus it does not seem to let us as viewers try to understand or comprehend just exactly what the heck is going on. The way it goes about trying to introduce new characters and plot points makes me feel like (or realize) that the TG:RE story in particular is just….without a soul. There are no moments where the story tries to make contrasts between brutality and beauty. Nearly all the characters on either side of the conflict no longer seem to fight for something important and precious that they’ve lost…they seem to fight for the sake of triumphing and looking supposedly like the good guys. I’m gonna be real here….there is no absolutely no sense of good guys or bad guys, and not in a good way. The whole chaotic jumping from battle to battle to battle…prevent us from having emotional impressions for the characters’ reasons to keep fighting and struggling. Additionally, practically all the main characters, who were the focal point in the first two seasons, are pretty much all sidelined, and barely make much of a difference in TG:RE’s story progression. Because this also defeats the narrative and thematic parts of what Tokyo Ghoul’s original concept had, it has to get me and others wondering: “What was the point of all that effort in storytelling in the first season? Was that just all for naught?” Instead, we get a whole amount of just over-edgy tones, cliché lines, useless plot points, forced drama, etc…..literally everything that ROTS under the sun.<br />
<br />
ART: 2/10; SOUND: 5/10<br />
Contrasting to the first two seasons, Tokyo Ghoul:RE’s animation quality has considerably dropped, especially during this second season. In terms of animation quality, the majority of this season felt more like a slideshow, which resulted in messy, tensionless action and cringeworthy half-hearted attempts to bring emotion. Not much else to say here…it’s just plain awful.<br />
<br />
As for the soundtracks, I’ll just go ahead and say this as probably part of the minority. I don’t really like the Tokyo Ghoul soundtracks on a personal level, but I’ll at least say it’s still really nice, and does make an attempt to fit the theme of the show itself; additionally, it at least keeps the Tokyo Ghoul fans interested. As for the voice acting, though, there’s no sense of genuine emotion, and feels forced now, compared to the first two seasons; it’s as if the voice actors themselves were starting to give up on the whole season themselves.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 1/10<br />
I’m not gonna be someone to excessively chew out Kaneki as a character, aka TG’s version of Shinji Ikari…I’ll let someone else do that. Besides, that by itself is not necessary anymore…why? Because it’s literally EVERYONE at fault. The reason for this is because the utilization, characterization, and development of the entire cast is virtually non-existent. The show basically introduced a bunch of new characters so suddenly and expected us to care about them right then and there, while ignoring all the characters from the previous two seasons that we actually do care about, as well as deconstructing them to certain degrees to further render them irrelevant to the plot. Because of the story’s “Fast and Furious” pacing and drastic change of themes from the first two seasons, there is no real sense of progression in any of the characters, not a single one. All we really can see in the character department are just mindless husks specifically programmed to emulate fake emotion, resulting in obnoxious, overly dramatic lines that make us cringe more than feel for them. It is also because of this that we tend to easily forget who’s who, even if it’s the main characters…apparently the show neglected to properly address the cast’s collectively similar-looking hair colors and hairstyles.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 1/10<br />
This could’ve been a 0/10, in all honesty. From the first two seasons, I actually did enjoy seeing the fleeting moments of emotion and beauty, because like I mentioned earlier, they symbolized the Ghouls’ struggles to live normal, peaceful lives. Even though I still though the first season was still barely sub-par, those were good moments that I can appreciate.<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:Re, however, throws the good stuff ALL away. Throughout both RE seasons, the show became one of those kinds where it felt like a chore to watch, just for the sake of seeing how this messy conundrum of a show that tried to take itself seriously would end. The attempts at dramatic lines and edgy violence during the fights are just laughable.<br />
<br />
You know what’s even worse? The story was so discombobulated that Fumination, in order to address the amount of confusion from the viewers, started a weekly live stream of the series where they explain everything leading up to the TG:Re story and what’s happening in each episode. THAT’S NOT A GOOD SIGN AT ALL.<br />
So here’s the real reason why it’s 1/10 instead of 0/10: TG:Re Season 2 Episode 7, (or TG:RE Episode 19). Yes, the infamous sex scene. The sequence leading up to that point was especially quite hilarious, I’ll admit, and the comedic gag in the “aftermath” of the intercourse was pretty amusing, too. Sadly, though, the sex scene by itself was screwed by the aforementioned bad quality of just showcasing slideshows. If the production crew had any sort of common sense by that point, then they should’ve just at least put actual quality in that scene and make the show a hentai for at least 10 minutes…is that too hard to ask? If the show is already so bad overall, they should at least give us a fleeting moment where we can say “totally effing worth it”.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Tokyo Ghoul:Re’s lack of effective storytelling, overall character development, nonsensical rapid pacing, and degrading animation quality is of diabolical proportions. As an entire story and series, Tokyo Ghoul is probably one of the most overrated series I’ve ever watched in my life, making the likes of Sword Art Online seem all too innocent and actually justified, and that says quite a lot. This second season of TG:Re by itself is one of those shows where I can actually say is “objectively bad” due to the lack of execution, direction, quality consistency, and overall character management. A better alternative to Tokyo Ghoul has already been mentioned at the start of this review: Parasyte The Maxim. That show has far better storytelling and characterization of the cast, as well as better handling of the themes, metaphors, and moral messages.<br />
However, if you’re one of those Tokyo Ghoul fanatics who want to watch the show for the sake of quenching your own Ghoul-like hunger, go right on ahead. I’m not stopping you. It’s your choice to make, not mine. As for the general anime fan, I’d suggest watching just the first two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul, and then just stop and avoid the TG:RE mess entirely, cause it’s really not worth seeing the story deconstructing itself and the theme it wanted to show from the start.<br />
Or better yet….just read the manga and save your life.<br />

    &quot;SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST SEASON OF TOKYO GHOUL:RE&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s fair to say that the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:re didn&#039;t leave a good impression on fans of the series (In fact, I think it made it worse). The problems that Root A had only got worse in Tokyo Ghoul:re with its only saving grace being its soundtrack. And with Root A no longer being canon, it kind of left Anime only&#039;s confused as to what the hell was going on (Although the story did not help with that). It would probably take a miracle for the anime franchise to redeem itself

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296787">
        and this second season would have to be the one to do it. I mean it couldn&#039;t get any worse, right? Well you would be wrong. <br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and grab your torches and pitchforks as I present to you the anime review of the the second season of Tokyo Ghoul:re. Lets begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
Haise Sasaki is no more. Kaneki has regained his memories and now wants out of the CCG. Exploiting a ghoul raid on the max security complex for ghouls, he, along with his ghoul friends, manages to escape and now plans to end the bloodshed between humans and ghouls. By becoming their leader, he wants peace. Meanwhile, the CCG has tracked down Aogiri&#039;s base of operations and raids it, hoping to put an end to them once and for all. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to say too much because that would mean I would had to go deep into spoiler territory. Not that it matters at this point. The story kind of goes back to the roots of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul and asks the question &quot;what is the difference between a human and a ghoul?&quot; Only this time, it is done much, much worse. To begin with, the story&#039;s pacing is awful. For example, Kaneki starts off as Kan-EDGY for a couple of episodes, only to revert back to nice Kaneki who just wants to protect his friends after two episodes. There is no development in the story to progress story threads and character arcs as it is all rushed to get a conclusion. Now, I&#039;ve never read the manga. The anime is the only time I&#039;ve experienced as to what Tokyo Ghoul has to offer. But it is clearly obvious where parts of the story have been just gutted out. There is little build up or over arching development here to get us invested into the story or its characters. It rushes from one part of the story to the next in order get to a conclusion. Not allowing the time to develop your plot just leaves people confused. It makes them go, &quot;what the hell is going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
You could take the story less seriously, but that is clearly not a good option. This kind of story needs to be paid attention but without the depth of its world and its characters, then you just leaving us to not care about the plot whatsoever. With the messages and themes Tokyo Ghoul tries to leave us, not caring about the plot because there isn&#039;t alot there to get us invested just tosses all of them aside and so we are left with a plot that is just going through the motion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 1.5/10 <br />
<br />
The same can be said for the characters. Depth is clearly lacking in these characters to get us invested. Now considering that there are so many characters in Tokyo Ghoul now, I know not everyone is going to get a fair share of development. But when important characters don&#039;t get good development, it has a repercussion on the rest of the cast unless they really stand out. In this case, none of them stand out. You would think that Kaneki would stand out and accepting who he is and what he has become, but nope. He&#039;s as boring and lifeless as the rest of the cast. The only character that got a sense of real closure to their character arc was Urie as he has slowly been able to stand on his own two feet and forge his own path while acknowledging those around him. Everyone else just get rushed conclusions to their character arcs. <br />
<br />
Returning characters also get little development or reasons as to why they have returned. Instead of me going, &quot;Oh cool, he/she is back.&quot; I&#039;m just like &quot;Ummm, who are you again? Oh yeah, now I remember you.&quot; There is a lack of fanfare to get us hyped about these returning characters to make the overall plot more interesting and make it more dynamic. It can be the same with established characters because some of them I barely know and the show wants me to care for them, But I don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t care for them because it seems the anime doesn&#039;t care about them. So why should I? <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 4/10<br />
<br />
The animation is once again pretty lackluster and feels even worse than before. The fight scenes especially feel lackluster with the cheap ways of animating a fight scene. This includes shaky cameras, cutaways and basically treating it like a slideshow. It really makes the fights have less impact and don&#039;t invoke a sense awe or grip that the fight should invoke. Considering the amount of fight scenes in this season, that&#039;s a big negative. The art design as well feels uninspired as it just looks so bleak and bland. Tokyo Ghoul hasn&#039;t really been known for its animation quality. But here, it just feels even worse than before. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 8.5/10 <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is the only good thing to come out of this series. It just sounds so beautiful and wondrous. You can listen to the music and just forget all of the bad that has come from this series. It has always been a highlight of the Tokyo Ghoul franchise and here is no exception. It continues the trend of this franchise having great music. <br />
<br />
The opening as well is great. TK returns for this opening called &quot;Kartharsis.&quot; Along with the great vocals and instrumentals, the visuals are also nicely symbolic, showing how Kaneki will always keep going, no matter what persona he adopts. While not as beautiful or colourful as Unraval, its probably the second best opening out of the four we&#039;ve got. It&#039;s funny, no matter how crap the series is. The openings are always agreed on to be one of the best. The ending sequence does show us some beautiful art; backed up some nice vocals to calm the viewer and realise the beauty in this world. <br />
<br />
The English dub was always considered, by me, to be one of the more underrated dubs out there. Austin Tindle puts in another good performance as Kaneki as he brings a very humble Kaneki yet he can also bring a good serious tone as well. Other performances like Adam Gibbs as Urie, Brina Palencia as Touka and pretty much the rest of the cast are also well done. They managed to make the material they were given work which is honestly surprising.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
This mess of an adaptation of one of the most popular manga of all time has been a travesty. At this point, I wonder who Tokyo Ghoul&#039;s anime adaptation is for. It ain&#039;t for the anime only&#039;s because with them probably being lost in what is going on and Root A not being canon doesn&#039;t help. It ain&#039;t for those who read the manga because they just watched this show be mangled into a shell of what it is supposed to be. Even die hard fans must be dissapointed in this. Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is probably the worst in the franchise and since this anime franchise has been going down hill since the first Tokyo Ghoul season, that&#039;s saying something. I can&#039;t care for the story or its characters because there isn&#039;t enough there to make me care. Its animation is lackluster than ever and the soundtrack can only go so far to make it slightly better. I heard this season was adapting at least 120 chapters. 120 CHAPTERS! You can&#039;t adapt that much without the story suffering as a result and it shows here. <br />
<br />
I hope someone, someday reboots this franchise and is able to recapture the magic that made the first season of Tokyo Ghoul so enjoyable. Give it the treatment it deserves. But for now, we look back at what is probably one of the most overrated anime franchises of all time and makes us wonder if it could have been so much more. <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 2/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 3.4/10 Recommendation: Don&#039;t f***ing bother<br />
<br />

    You know Tokyo Ghoul was soooo amazing in season 1 and 2, really had a huge fanbase and a lot of hype, but it took them so long to produce the next season. Yet alas it was here and we didn&#039;t get a single recap of what happened or whats going on they expected us to know everything, and it took all my brain power to figure out what was happening and it was really nice in the end.<br />
<br />
THEN we have this season and boy if u thought that seasons story was messed haha you haven&#039;t even seen this one. Its story is a complete

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292989">
        disaster ud think i am watching another show. I legit thought i had missed some episodes, they don&#039;t explain shit! I am so confused here i don&#039;t remember any of the characters long enough it is so rushed, they rushed the last season which I kinda enjoyed the whole Sasaki Haisai thing and it reminded of the old TG.<br />
<br />
But this is like absolutely terrible, at this point i am just watching cause of the art and action, the story matters no more its ruined, and I am sad to see such a good anime go to waste :(

    Tokyo ghoul does not deserve all the hate it gets. Is it perfect? No. But is it as bad as everyone wants to make it out to be? No. It’s understandable that fans of the manga would be upset over what even I will admit is a flawed adaption. But does that make the show bad? While yes being confused over who some of the characters are was annoying, I still loved watching this show and seeing characters I&#039;ve come to enjoy grow up. Before I go into the review I want to clarify that this review will be a overall of all four seasons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296795">
        but I will focus mainly on the two Re seasons. I will also state that I have only read the first manga and not yet Re. Overall Tokyo Ghoul does a solid job of giving its viewers a 6-8 out of 10 anime that takes its own way of telling the story. <br />
<br />
Animation (9/10): Not much to say on this one. The animation is beautiful. Characters are colorful and lifelike. The kagune and everything else ghoul related always looks intense with a touch of horror. Backgrounds look lifelike and when there&#039;s a scene in Kaneki’s head it always gives that feeling of being inside a consciousness. Animation should not be a deter for this show.<br />
<br />
Music/Voice Acting (8/10): While not part of their planning I do detract for the english cast, the gap between the two casts is just to wide but I only take away half a point for it. It loses its other points for background music, for a intense and deep show the music just never seems to want to add to what&#039;s going on. However the brilliant openings and endings as well as A+ voice acting gives the show a high score. <br />
<br />
Characters (9/10): While a mixed bag the characters from Ghoul are some of the most widely known and influential. Hell I still do the Kaneki finger crack two years later. Others like Touka, Juzou, Hinami and the the quinque group, allow for a variety of personalities and character development. While not always flushed out the development is there and shows that these characters are more then just what they were made out to be. The characters of Ghoul make the show, as much as everything else helps the variety of people to be attached to allows the show to touch who it does. However we must all bow to down to the ultimate puffball Saiko.<br />
<br />
Plot (5.5/10): Yeah here’s where I gotta be critical. The story is a mess, the first two seasons did a decent job of telling a storyline but all that went down the drain in Re. I don&#039;t know if it was just the amount of anime I watch in a week, which is a lot, but I felt like I could never remember what happened in the last episode. Obviously their were a ton of characters that we knew nothing about and just had to accept were there. I mean the whole “twist” in the last season with the Washuu clan made me pause and think if any of these people were mentioned before. So yes the story is a complete mess, I understand it&#039;s hard to put everything from a manga into a anime but if that&#039;s the case the studio should have requested longer seasons or just made it fully original. Either would of been better then what was produced. However at the end of the day the story stumbles together into something that is still enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10): Taking away the many things wrong with Re and Ghoul as a whole, I enjoy watching the show. It gave me a story about a boy who just wanted to protect the things that made him happy. It has made me friends and given me laughs and the euphoria moments of nostalgia. If someone didn’t enjoy this show and kept watching it, it was only so they could complain about it more. But to me and I&#039;m sure many others out there, Tokyo Ghoul is a show that provided the entertainment that it was made to. <br />
<br />
Overall (7-8/10): I can&#039;t really pick a grade for this. I would say for Re season 2, it gets a 7 but Tokyo Ghoul as a whole gets a 8. A series should not be punished because the studio making it twisted the plot. While the mistakes of this show do detract a lot, the positives that people don&#039;t look at still make it a very enjoyable show. A lot of the hate that Ghoul gets is because of fans who are upset, and while I can understand that, a show does not deserved to be tanked just because you don&#039;t like how it was made. The Tokyo Ghoul anime will go down as one of the most controversial but life changing shows, with a helping of impactful and memorable characters, especially Saiko. <br />

    This show never deserve this hate I don&#039;t mean it&#039;s best anime in the history but isn&#039;t worse than One punch man on and you guys give them one out of 10 it&#039;s completely unfair I understand why you guys  underrate this anime but if you read the manga it&#039;s so delicious and astonishing I believe after watching this anime please read the manga and you will like it believe me. <br />
and thank you for reading.<br />
<br />
Please do not oppress this anime because he had the means one day, but it was destroyed by the studio, please Kaneki deserve at least nine of 10

    it&#039;s confusing and it&#039;s like they were no connection or proper continuity from the story last season<br />
the anime itself seems rushed and poorly executed.i am very disappointed of this anime especially on episode 3.<br />
overall the anime this season was really poorly executed and it seems like it wont improve on the upcoming episode.The animation was mediocre but the story telling is horrible,season 1 and season 2 was good and it was exciting to watch the show and get to know each character and delve into their stories.<br />
i&#039;ll probably recommend switching to reading the manga as i will for the first time after this shit show

    Tokyo Ghoul:re 2nd Season is honestly terrible. For anime only watchers we have not been introduced to half the characters, the time skips seemingly happen at random and there is barely any dialogue between the characters we do know which makes it even harder to understand the plot line. <br />
<br />
The episodes consist of so many random fight scenes it feels like watching a crappy youtube compilation. It is an actual shame because people have told me how good the manga is and I enjoyed season 1 but after that it has really gone downhill. <br />
<br />
I would not recommend watching this show to anyone.

    This show is more confusing than my relationship. Like seriously, what is even going on in half these episodes? Who thought it was a good idea to squeeze 120 chapters into 12 episodes? It&#039;s like they made nothing from the original series and are on a poor budget. Like even 3DCG with 24 episodes would&#039;ve been better.<br />
<br />
Pacing is too hectic, it&#039;s literally like a train wreck, I have nothing else to say except avoid this mess. Or watch if you enjoy roller coasters<br />
<br />
The show makes a particular mecha anime from this season look like it was decent despite being also a train wreck. LOL

    Literally the worst and most disappointing anime i have ever seen, the character development was complete garbage. Kaneki is the worst main character that could have ever been chosen for this type of anime. The uniqueness of having one eyed ghouls is what made season 1 and 2 of tokyo ghoul at least decent and they completely dimolished that uniqueness in the new series of tokyo ghoul. <br />
<br />
This anime was a waste of time, i hated it. Trash. One of the worst i&#039;ve ever seen and i&#039;ve seen a MANY animes. + the art was way better in the first seasons of tokyo ghoul. <br />
<br />

    *THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN&#039;T READ THE MANGA!*<br />
<br />
Alright so if you are like me you probably just watch anime and never tried or have any interest in reading manga. So keep in mind that I fully understand you, even tho I&#039;ve read the Tokyo Ghoul manga.<br />
So, I had a friend that started reading the manga way back then and he always told me that the manga was better than the anime and that I should read it. I kept hearing this from not only him but from the whole anime community. So when the first season of Tokyo Ghoul:Re came out I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294070">
        felt forced to read the manga cause I lost so many important things that have only been explained in the manga... I was lost, I didn&#039;t know what was going on, they were rushing the anime so hard... and now they&#039;re doing even worse since they re cramming 120 chapters of the manga in 12 episodes, and let me tell you, that is a fckin JOKE! It is simply not possible but whatever. With that being said I decided to give a chance to the manga. Let me tell you that it was the best thing I could&#039;ve done to fully enjoy what is Tokyo Ghoul, the character development feels so good, the mental progression of Kaneki feels even better and we can actually understand what Kaneki is feeling. It&#039;s simply wonderful how reading the manga made me an even bigger fan of Tokyo Ghoul (and keep in mind that it was one of my favorite animes by the time). If someone comes to me and asks &quot;Do you recommend watching Tokyo Ghoul?&quot; I&#039;ll just say NO, I do not. I&#039;ll not tell them to read the manga cause since they don&#039;t read manga or are not already engaged in the series it is ok for them to not read the manga, but if you love Tokyo Ghoul, PLEASE, go read the manga! I swear you will not regret it!<br />
<br />
I just felt like saying this since Tokyo Ghoul:re season 2 is being a complete joke to the series, please kids go read the manga if you love TG, if not just drop this shit. It is not worth your time.<br />
<br />
Sorry bad englando.<br />
<br />
 Have a nice day! :)))

    So let me be honest with myself and for anybody that reads this. I fucking loved Tokyo Ghoul as a whole, thus I will try to discuss the series as whole instead of focusing on the last season.<br />
For a start, this is my first review and happens to be the first anime that I watched after reading my first manga. I loved the anime and how it stayed close to the manga (Root A, lol never mind). Yes there were bits and pieces that were missing such as character stories, altered plots and so forth. However, that being said it felt complete, meaning that I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328959">
        was satisfied with how the anime adapted the manga. Now I will go into more detail about each season <br />
<br />
Season 1: Tokyo Ghoul<br />
What a beginning. The introduction of characters, Kaneki, Rize, Touka, Yoshimura, Shu, Hide, Nishio and others was great. Right from the beginning, I knew this was going to be insane and recalling what happened in the manga, put a smile on my face. The season did feel rushed, jumping from plot to plot, but, that said I did read the manga and know what it is impossible to the anime to add all parts from the manga. The manga really does a great job at establishing the stakes of what is going to happen from now on, which the anime only briefly glosses over. The dialogue is similar with me remembering and anticipating what is going to be said. The animation doesn&#039;t come close to the beauty the manga has, but it is respectable. I would of never of thought that something in a book would be more beautiful than something on my computed screen. The fight scenes were amazing from both sources, and I couldn&#039;t help but go back and fourth in my head seeing the black and white fight scene and then seeing the animated version with my eyes. Overall I loved it.<br />
<br />
Season 2: Tokyo Ghoul Root A<br />
Let me start with WTH?????????. The plot is a punch in the gut for me since the manga is completely different to the anime. Changing character plots, story plots and scenes really put a bad taste in my mouth for this season. Yes. I will be comparing this to the manga, since it is the reason why I started watching this in the first place. Ok, back to the anime, I dislike the removal of certain characters and their importance to the story because I feel that they play a pivotal role for the story. I feels like the studio and writer of the anime just said &quot;fuck you I&#039;m doing whatever I want&quot;. Overall trash and actually made my salty.<br />
<br />
Season 3: Tokyo Ghoul: re 1st season<br />
I haven&#039;t read the manga of this, but from what I read online, people have said that this season stays as close to the original source as any other season. Hearing this, made me happy, especially how I got cucked by the previous season. And then.......... Sasaki showed up. Like, who the fuck this is. There was no backstory, no explanation to what happened to Kaneki except that he got fucked and received multiple personality disorder. The rest of the &quot;new characters&quot; were bland and easily forgetful. Even now after just watching it I don&#039;t remember any of their names. The story was like throwing a packet of cards on the floor and you build the story based on what card you picked up. It felt random and stupid at times, and me thinking about it now still doesn&#039;t understand it at all. Overall confused and disappointed<br />
<br />
Season 3: Tokyo Ghoul: re 2nd season (finale)<br />
WOW, I honestly don&#039;t know why this season got shitted on my with ratings. Really a 6.5? I fucking loved this. Great character development as well story which gave me a reason and motivation to finish it. The redemption of characters did feel chiche but I was able to look past that with the characters themselves. And then the ending. For the very first time I actually got what I wanted from an ending. Something that would warm my heart and satisfy me. Not a bad or twisted cliff hanger that make me fucked up, but something sweet, peaceful and that would make me shed a tear of happiness. Overall I am happy<br />
<br />
Well this about does it. All I will say is that Tokyo Ghoul has its ups and downs just like any other anime or manga, but it gave me a sense of happiness when watching and reading it. I do recommend this to those who enjoy a dramatic horror anime. Thankyou Sui Ishida for writing something that will stay in my heart for a very long time :)<br />

    I am not a fan of writing a review so early on in the season and I always feel as show has some redeeming qualities but unfortunatly this one doesnt.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul: Re season 1, it was a little messy but I could follow it okay. However season 2 is unfollowable, it jumps from 1 story arcs climax to another story arcs climax with no details, backstories or any explanation as to what the hell is going on! I dont think I&#039;ve ever been so lost in an anime. <br />
<br />
Guess I should go read the manga? thanks anime!

    Don&#039;t watch this anime if you haven&#039;t read the manga, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
RE S2 adapts 120 chapters in twelve episodes. That&#039;s ten chapters per episode. You won&#039;t understand what is going on if you don&#039;t already know the plot beforehand. The anime cuts out all the exposition and context clues that are crucial to understanding the story, and leaves a jumbled mess of confusing events. All the scenes that should have emotional weight don&#039;t because there is no build-up to it. Tense high-stake situations become comical instead because of the horrible animation and lightning speed adaptation of a plot that jumps the shark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please someone tell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296956">
        me what is going on.&quot; - Kuki Urie, in a scene that seems to break the 4th wall.<br />
<br />
This show should be considered fan service for manga readers who want to see their favorite chapters animated and colorized. When looked at it that way, it isn&#039;t too terrible. The character designs stay surprisingly consistent throughout the whole series with no horrific deformations. Studio Pierrot took some creative liberties and animated an exciting Arata armor fight scene. The kagune stay true to their manga designs, and were sometimes even impressive - Tatara and Saiko&#039;s come to mind. It was exciting to see Kaneki&#039;s final form in action.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this anime? If you haven&#039;t read the manga, it&#039;s a hard no. If you have, then it might be tolerable if you go in with low expectations and consider it to an addendum to a series you already enjoy.

    Why Studio Pierrot, why? Such a good show with rich story and characters just for it to be rushed and make totally no sense.<br />
<br />
Tokyo ghoul anime was one of the biggest letdowns in the anime history. The first season of the anime was really good and I enjoyed it a lot but ever since they split from manga in season 2, everything just stopped making sense and became like a candy without sugar. <br />
<br />
After that the 3rd season eventually continued with the manga but skipped so many things it just totally stopped making sense, totally. No explanation as to what happened after the events of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382751">
        season 2 and the whole thing was just messed up without any explaining. No character development, too many new characters, random fights without any reason and many more. <br />
<br />
And finally, the last season of the Tokyo Ghoul anime. Oh man, this was a total shitshow, nothing else. So many random things happening, the art and quality slowly getting worse and the story just making no sense. The manga had 120 chapters of this season but they did only 12 episodes, out of 120 chapters. WHAT THE FUCK????? <br />
<br />
This whole anime adaption was just one of the worst things I saw in a while and I hope some random studio will make a reboot out of this because the manga compared to the anime is just painful.

    Tokyo Ghoul: re is the biggest mystery anime of all time without even trying. It never shows all of its cards, it doesn’t clue you in on the show’s meaning, it shows what it wants to show and dips. Personally, I’m more inclined to like this sort of story writing, books/anime like Overlord did it best in my opinion but the problem with this is that it wasn’t intentional. Clearly, there was some sort of disconnect on what the manga was portraying and what the anime was able to deliver and something went wrong, I have several theories on why that happened but that’s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296783">
        important, what’s important is whether or not I’d recommend it (I won’t).<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Tokyo Ghoul started off really strong in the series and I fought tooth and nail to defend it even though all its confusing storylines, but I’d only recommend it if you’re willing to solve any questions by yourself (by using the wiki) because the anime isn’t going to answer any of them.<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Let’s be honest with ourselves, the Tokyo Ghoul:re manga really wasn’t that good in the first place, so when Studio Pierrot was told to make an anime adaptation of this they were fighting an uphill battle. Not only that but they were only allowed to use 12 episodes per season so they had to cram. This, of course, led to some scenes getting cut in a manga where it already felt like scenes were cut from the final draft making the whole thing a lot worse. The actual plot wasn’t really that bad but they tried to paint both sides of a story by making EVERY OTHER CHARACTER an insufferable asshole the whole time to paint both sides as awful as humanly possible and it made it almost impossible to root for anyone. That being said there were a few moments the anime managed to keep which were really nice (not enough, but there were still there).<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Say what you will about the story but HOT DAMN were (some of) those kagunes BADASS. I feel like all of the art budget went to the fight scenes which really doesn’t matter since 90% of the show was pure fight scenes. This does, however, mean that anything else no matter how serious or impactful to the story, never looked as good as it really intended to be. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9 <br />
I can’t lie, I loved the opening AND closing, its one of those shows where you watch youtube videos of both the Opening and the Ending. Voice actors were more or less on top of it, they all fit their roles to a T, funnily enough, though, all of the best voice actors spoke the least. Finally, the sounds of kagunes activating sounded badass, but without a good reference, I can’t say for sure whether its top of the line or bottom-tier. <br />
<br />
Character 3:<br />
My favorite part of any show would be its character development, unfortunately, the only person to ever receive any sort of character development would be Kaneki. This could’ve been negated with a cast of reasonably written characters but as I said earlier: every other character were written to is insufferable as possible so that’s COMPLETELY out of the window. I honestly would’ve cared at all if Kaneki acted like… well… Kaneki in more than three scenes I would’ve given this a higher score. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Gotta give points where its due, while I was confused the entire time the action scenes were pretty top notch in terms of enjoyment so I’d give it a 7<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
This show is 100% flash no filler, it&#039;s like the recently completed: Baki (2018) without even trying which is actually not a good thing at all. I would’ve recommended it unless:<br />
You’re not looking for a story<br />
You have the time to search through the wiki/manga to answer all your questions. <br />
