Among tons of promising sequels and exciting, intriguing anime that are pumped into this season, I step into watching this show with no clue whatsoever it is about, and it left me impressed with the gory yet thrilling adventure of the protagonists against the relentless demons, warm my heart with a genuine portrayal of friendship that exceeds &#039;protect to protect&#039; values, and really blew my expectation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387503">
        away. <br />
<br />
In a society where demons of different races and classes exist unbeknownst to the human, it&#039;s up to a detective office cooperating with the higher-up in police officials to keep the boundary between two kinds clear, and visible. The main character, a child with high regenerative skill and enormous brute strength is recruited into the detective team from outskirt. <br />
<br />
But, there&#039;s a catch: he doesn&#039;t know love, and is emotionless.<br />
<br />
As the plot progresses, ensemble characters with different talents, and most importantly, captivatingly dark background stories intertwine together. It&#039;s almost like a celebration of a cluster of broken demons, yet with human emotions, that are brought together for a chance to live—regardless of the numbing pain that are yet to be unfolded, or lingering truth that are to be discovered. <br />
<br />
Strangely, it is because of their childish like interaction and casual exchange of worries and concerns that forge the trio&#039;s (sometimes, quartet) relationship. It&#039;s not &#039;tomo-tachi&#039; (friends) given the perilous and critical nature of their work, but it&#039;s &#039;nakama&#039; (comrades) between them that added much depth to their bond. When one of them is in pinch, they do not shout or fill themselves with flashbacks to fuel their power and become temporarily invincible.<br />
<br />
They cry.<br />
<br />
Like a little child; because, in many senses, they are. They cannot shoulder the whole responsibility and burden that the world dropped on them by themselves. And this is where the depiction of comrades, where they would rely on each other, comes in through the perspective of the emotionless main character, Kabane. It is precisely because he sees thing subjectively—evil as evil, good as good—that he can evoke the best in his comrades, that they know how frustrating it is to be powerless and how powerful feelings, emotions are. And, as he learns more about the meaning of empathy, with love in its many shapes and forms with his comrades, I believe the story will reach much greater heights than what were depicted.<br />
<br />
As for the animation, the fighting sequences are fluid and colorful; for the soundtracks, the music matches the ambience the show was going for perfectly. It seeps in creepy, thrilling piano notes in the moments of suspense and danger, while giving off a blood-pumping, hopeful, evil-hero-like vibe when the protagonists are face-to-faced with the merciless demons. The opening is great, with its editing matching the tempo of the songs while the J-rock ending ended each episode in a positive note.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kemono Jihen is a show that wraps its hidden dark elements, and stories inside layers of pure, and genuine bond of reliance that the protagonists share, exhibiting their fragile, yet unyielding determination and emotions. It can get really, really dark sometimes, yet at the same time, you couldn&#039;t help but to crave for more of their heartfelt moments. <br />
<br />
So, if you&#039;re into exploring some supernatural stories of demons through the eyes of young protagonists, I&#039;d definitely recommend Kemono Jihen. Beware though, as it could shock and traumatize your senses, then warm and melt your heart when you least expected it.<br />

    Kemono Jihen has been a certain surprise this season. So much so that I&#039;ve gone ahead and checked out the manga, and hoping to keep up with it after it finishes. It has interested me that much. From it&#039;s story, characters, to how the overall themes look in general. They really can make Kemono Jihen look terrifying, but also great at the same time, let me explain.<br />
<br />
Art and sound:<br />
Since I just touched upon both, let me explain. This isn&#039;t a happy go lucky anime, which of course means a more darker tone on some of the scenes. But it&#039;s well done here, they really make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377634">
        things look disturbing, creepy, and disturbing. Even the sound in each of those scenes, it really adds to the entire atmosphere of the entire show. But they also can make more brighter scenes stand out too, with a tone and style that fits the scenes that they are in. Not too bright, but that right kind of tone. Which is great.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
Here is where it really comes into it&#039;s own. We start of following as the plot is described on here, the case behind these dead animals, and what is truly going on. Only to learn hidden truths, and what Kemono are, as Kemono are all kinds of creatures. Think Youkai culture in some cases, think Touhou, think Kyokou Suiri and how all those have some of their creatures of all types. Within this show, there are all types of Kemono, from those who&#039;ll attack and feed, to those being more good, to those being an evil bitch. A good mix range that can only provide more entertainment. As we come to a detective agency, dealing with all types of strange quests involving Kemono such as of course solving the case of dead animals, to helping a guy fall in love with a cat lady, along with meeting a rather dangerous foe in the form in Inari Yoko.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, let&#039;s talk about them!<br />
We have our two MCs, one being Kabane, who can come across as being blank and emotionless, but that&#039;s more that he hasn&#039;t experienced these emotions as of yet, or hasn&#039;t got an understanding of how things work unless he&#039;s guided, but he&#039;s still a good character. We have Inugami, the head of the agency, and seemingly the good at his job cool customer type, while having a bit of sneakiness to him, a really respectable guy who does what is right. We also have Akira whom has the longest name I&#039;ve seen I swear, a real germaphobe, as he hates gross things, and can come off as your typical social media buzz person, the type that&#039;ll spend all day on it. Next we have Shiki, whom I can best describe as Bakugo honestly. With how he reacts at least, but he&#039;s got a good head on his shoulders. Finally so far we have Kon whom wants to be a good girl and gets upset when she isn&#039;t, a real cutie. Compared to her boss Yoko, whom is a right controlling bitch. But a good written villain for sure. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s blend of characters is a real highlight of the show, as each of them mesh well together, and I can&#039;t wait to see future episodes of when certain scenes are animated, so we can see more of the characters and what they have to offer. It&#039;s gonna be so great, you&#039;ll love them as much as I did.<br />
<br />
Kemono Jihen is honestly a secret hit of the season, I dig it, you&#039;ll dig it, we&#039;ll all dig it. Pick it up now, and if you can&#039;t wait for new episodes, go check out the Manga too!

    It&#039;s sad how overlooked this show is because of all the sequels and big name shows this season. Kemono Jihen really is an underrated, hidden gem that hooks you in from the first episode. <br />
<br />
The show may look kiddy to you but don&#039;t let appearences fool you as it is a surprisingly mature and dark show. Part of the new wave of &quot;darker&quot; shonens that are unafraid to show morbid, disturbing things every so often.<br />
<br />
That said, even though the atmosphere when our gang goes out solving mysteries is often dark and unforgiving and contrasts heavily from the lighthearted and wholesome slice of life moments that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379721">
        are equally as enjoyable, Kemono Jihen still preserves a lot of its childlike innocence as we slowly discover what it means to live as a normal person, and not a monster with our protagonist, Kabane.<br />
<br />
Our main cast, which comprises mostly of kids so far, are all extremely endearing and adorable characters you can easily empathise with or relate to. They all have their own unique traits and personalities and I really enjoy the genuine and sincere interactions they have with each other in their found family of sorts. I&#039;ve never felt this deeply attached to a cast of characters from an anime in a really long time, which attests to the anime&#039;s skillfulness at tugging at your heartstrings as the emotional moments will really get you feeling something.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m only 5 episodes in so far but Kemono Jihen has been a brilliant, competently animated show this season everyone ought to check out<br />

    So Kemono Jihen.<br />
<br />
The main draw that brought me to this series was the art style, having similar qualities to the very popular Demon Slayer as well as being a shounen. I didn’t know what to expect with this series and went in blind. How was it? <br />
<br />
...........Meh<br />
<br />
The story follows around a detective at a supernatural agency where he lives with children he picks up off the streets and uses them to his advantage and tosses them into life-threatening situations. Putting aside my jokingly blunt summary, the agency focuses on hunting down Kemono, or beast-like entities. So far, the story hasn’t shown much potential and seems

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377155">
        to be almost a monster-of-the-week show.<br />
<br />
The artstyle, as stated in the intro, was the main attraction to this series. Characters look distinct from one another and the background art looks good. Nothing much to note here.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only interesting things about this show so far is:<br />
<br />
• The darker/grim moments<br />
<br />
With a show focusing on Kemono, it has the liberty of making them look very off-putting. One example being a rhino-sized deer with human-sized antlers smiling with a bloody, toothy grin. How these creature work and interact with those around it is intriguing.<br />
<br />
Now let’s talk about the main detriment of this show and what I think brings this show down:<br />
<br />
• The characters are bland<br />
<br />
The main cast is quite boring. The only notable character is the detective who is a chill, level-headed guy. Besides him, the other cast is pretty forgettable and uninteresting. You have the MC who’s a typical “I don’t know how to act like a human”, his loud friend who yells for the sake of yelling, and a trap. One other character introduced is a blonde fox girl, however so far her character is just “I serve my master”, so we will have to wait and see what happens with her.<br />
<br />
All in all, this show has been a let-down. With the show only airing 1/3 of its episodes, I don’t see this show getting that much better, or at least enough to make it notable enough to check out. If they decide to go a more sinister route with the show, it might pick up. However, I anticipate it’s going to keep its happier atmosphere.<br />
<br />

    Before the review, I should mention that the MC is a dumb dude. He is like an empty vessel without any emotions, feelings, etc (until he is thought). <br />
<br />
<br />
Kemono Jihen mainly stresses on the topic which revolves around kids who have some special abilities which is different from normal humans, which makes those kids Kemono (meaning monster).<br />
<br />
The MC starts off living in a small village where he thinks that he is the only one like a monster until he meets a dude. Then the dude takes MC to his place in Tokyo and with other kids, the MC starts going on missions related to Kemono

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387526">
        stuffs.<br />
<br />
Things I liked -&gt;<br />
1) The MC is cold which makes him to thinks less and and fight more.<br />
2) The teamwork of the MC and other kids.<br />
3) A slight romance in this action anime.<br />
4) Every episode has a humorous laughing effect.<br />
<br />
Finally, this anime is best suited for binging.<br />

    This show can best be summed up and described this way (with the help of a former friend of whom this description fits to a T):<br />
The world not as simple as it seems. Together with humans, there exists another type of being: they are called Kemono: supernatural monsters, spirits, and demons, whom used to co-exist peacefully. However, one day, a war broke out. Some thought that humans were behind it, since they instinctively discriminate against races different than themselves, and others think that Kemono were at fault. Sometime after, the story brings us to a remote village. For some time now, dead animals have been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387500">
        found there. Kohachi Inugami, the owner of a detective agency that specializes in the occult, meets a neglected boy named Kusaka &quot;Dorotabou&quot; Kabane in a remote village, who is avoided by all villagers and works instead of going to school. And it turns out that Kabane is a half-ghoul, whose true nature is suppressed by a lifestone. Kabane is always discriminated and labelled as the mud Yokai, will he help the detective uncover the truth behind the animal killings?<br />
<br />
Kemono Jihen is one of those works that you rarely see about very often, much less the obscurity of the manga since it was released in Jump Square (instead of the more popular Weekly Shonen Jump), despite having all the common bells and whistles you would think of in the typical Shounen genre. At first glance, it&#039;ll definitely remind you of the similarities due to the dark fantasy and supernatural genres that are closely reminiscent of Bungou Stray Dogs, from the setting of the &quot;detective&quot; theme to the main character whose personality is like Dororo, unbeknownst to his main power and only being accompanied by the small numbers whom have encountered for the mystery and supernatural realisms. In fact, from the moment when the story plot starts moving from the get-go, there is this alluring sense that all is not what it seems, and the next thing you know, you&#039;ve sunk your teeth deep into this rabbit hole that keeps the constant grip on your toes as to where circumstances would go. Think of it like Kyokou Suiri (a.k.a In/Spectre): a great 1-to-1 adaptation, but without the heavy exposition and easy storytelling and progression that will keeps you glued to the episodes for a few hours on end. Although the presentation demographic is different from Bungou Stray Dogs, don&#039;t let that fool you into thinking that teenagers don&#039;t have it just as hard as adults, nope. In fact, it&#039;s quite mature with its dark themes and intrepid to the ghoulish, macabre and grisly nature.<br />
<br />
Mostly a character-driven story, where I can give praise to Kemono Jihen, lies with the characters that can sometimes be quite morbid in their ways, but I feel that they should be given more recognition:<br />
- Our MC is Kabane &quot;Dorotabo&quot; Kusaka, a 13-year-old human-ghoul hybrid. An abandoned kid with little to no education of the world, what he is able in is limited of the little common sense that he has. The lifestone (or Life Calculus) in his possession is a gateway to understanding both his control of the thirst for ghoulish thirst, as well as finding out the connections of his parents, and the rest is history. Being someone who looks innocent and straightforward, he has a self-sacrifical spirit of always being ready to put his life on the line for others when danger strikes, since he is an immortal, provided his head stays intact. He&#039;s the experiential definition of &quot;Act first, think later&quot;.<br />
- The detective in question is Kohachi Inugami. As you&#039;ve guessed, he&#039;s also a Kemono, and a strong tanuki at that, often referred to as &quot;the Kemonoist&quot;. Running his own occult consultancy office to take care of specialized Kemono-centric issues is a cinch when the outside world practically does not know that Kemono co-exist, and he&#039;s the meditator between both humans and Kemono beastkin alike, other than managing the care and concern of fellow teenage Kemono under him, and seeks to long for a world where both humans and Kemono can co-exist.<br />
- The first of three Kemono under Inugami&#039;s belt: Shiki Tademaru, a 14-year-old Arachne-human hybrid who had been passed into Inugami&#039;s custody by his uncle Akio. Acting like a tsundere for the most part, Shiki can be often as brash and rude, and at worst, seem off-putting than most, but it is for this reason alone that as time progresses, he grows to be rational and level-headed in making sure to taking good care of them at the same time, an influence from his family of a single mom and 8-year-old daughter Aya (who thinks maturely but acts immaturely) who are also Arachne Kemono.<br />
- The second of three Kemono under Inugami&#039;s belt: Akira Iwakiyama-yuki-sa-to-Shirona-no-go-Juuroku-shi (that&#039;s a mouthful), or best translated as &quot;The 56th child of Shirona of the Snow Village in Mount Iwaki&quot;, because he is a descendant of a Yuki-onna. Despite Akira&#039;s lifestyle of embracing feminity by acting like a girl and doing all the stuff that girls like or tend to do, Akira is a he, not a she. So in retrospect, not a tomboy, but a tomgirl. He mostly takes care of affairs within the Inugami occult office, due to his hate for disgusting things and if encountered, cowers and faints at fear&#039;s door. Having a twin Yuki-okono brother (Yui) whose fate was to become the chief of a Yuki-onna village for nothing more than a tool of sexual reproduction for pride and ego reasons, that&#039;s as dark and gutsy as it can get.<br />
- The last of three Kemono under Inugami&#039;s belt: Mihai, an immortal vampire, but a shut-in NEET whose mentorship under Inugami has seen a fair share of him being a &quot;Jack of all trades, Master of all&quot; from utilizing technology for hacking purposes and communication from an online perspective. He&#039;s quite the over-bearing character with a narcisstic mindset, yet he doesn&#039;t go without the reluctance of help every once in a while.<br />
- And what&#039;s a good team of &quot;protagonists&quot; without a good team of antagonists? And Inari Yoko is just that: the beautiful and alluring kitsune Kemono, serving for both humans and Kemono as the superintendent of a police force, while under the farce that this is all but solidifying her position in the human society to one day bethrone the inevitable conflict between humans and Kemono due to her ruthless ways of self-satisfaction and vile manipulation. Under her belt are two kitsune Kemonos: 19-year-old Nobimaru and loyal follower Kon. Despite Nobimaru&#039;s shape-shifting abilities to attune to the same age as the Kemono under Inugami, his intelligence is backed by his personality of being a witty crafter of lies, and much like Inari, can manipulative circumstances to his advantage. Kon on the other hand, she follows wherever Inari may go, despite the fact that like Kabane, she&#039;s used as a tool to advance the former&#039;s tactics, and all that&#039;s required of Kon towards Inari is recognition that she is a &quot;good girl&quot;. May Kabane rescue Kon from Inari&#039;s hands one day, and let the sail ship between them.<br />
<br />
I find it quite fascinating for such a decades-old studio like Ajia-Do, I&#039;m presuming that the studio is trying to find what works for them, despite the low, yet consistent output of at least 1 show per year (just to maintain business as usual). Just look at the shows made by the studio in recent years: Isekai Maou was a decent job done, while both Isekai Bookworm and Kakushigoto firmly solidified the studio as being capable to perform in Slice-of-Life works, though this is the first time that the studio has returned to doing an action-heavy show since 2016&#039;s Shuumatsu no Izetta (that is averagely tacked-on mediocrity). Personally, I&#039;d like the studio to focus more on their bread-and-butter genre expertise, though I can&#039;t fault that the presentation in Kemono Jihen is finger lickin&#039; good and consistent throughout. Truly &quot;Are you (un)afraid of the Dark?&quot; levels of surrealism. Likewise with the music, it pretty much fits the whole dark theme to a T here as well. Once again, the massively popular Seiyuu Daisuke Ono hits the nail with the OP and Sayaka Sasaki with the ED, you couldn&#039;t have asked for a better OST than this. But honestly, though the production team isn&#039;t what you can call them strong, all I&#039;ve ever needed from a show like this is just one word: consistency, for the art of balancing skill and expertise, and that&#039;s all it matters.<br />
<br />
A hidden gem amongst the ever increasing popularity of contemporary Shounen series, yet easily overshadowed by the same circumstances as well. Everyone should check this out, and if you decide to pick this up, watch this on a binge, it&#039;ll do you good to keep you hooked from start to finish.

    The biggest problem with this anime is the lack of tension: the issues the main characters had with eachoter gets solved very easily and in the same episode i&#039;ts introduced, and fights don&#039;t last nearly as long to let the overpowered enemy inflict danger before being beaten by a spike of power that comes undeservedly.<br />
<br />
The powers are nothing impressive: the protagonist is just really strong and immortal, Shiki is Spider-Man and Akira has ice powers. But the characters do have personality and the anime focuses a lot on that.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a story about family and friends, and it can be pretty cute sometimes. The story is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383358">
        told in an episodic format, each episode tackling a random monster and some level of character growht - this last part being a solid positive.  But I&#039;ve seen that a lot already.

    I have definitely seen a good amount of modern Shounen&#039;s feature more &quot;edgy,&quot; &quot;mature,&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; themes. Oh well, honestly, probably for the better. The whole &quot;every good guy lives&quot; and &quot;MC protecting his friends&quot; tropes are really getting old.<br />
<br />
Kemono Jihen is a good example of a modern shounen integrating &quot;mature&quot; themes while also trying to relay as little good storytelling as possible by using edgy shock value while not developing characters in any meaningful way. It tries to integrate brutality into a morally good cast of characters, and while this can work, the execution of these themes are terrible to say the least.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391971">
        going to focus on Shiki, because it just highlights this absolutely horrendous edgy shock value story telling at its finest. <br />
<br />
Spoilers ahead, but trust me, nothing much of value has to be said about the story.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the point of the story where you reach Shiki&#039;s backstory, you already know that the main cast of characters have performed a few missions, few of which include killing anthropomorphic and intelligent beings, all of which were warranted. That being said, no humans have been harmed or killed by our main characters. You get where I&#039;m going with this?<br />
<br />
Shiki&#039;s uncle performed many atrocities on his mother. Forcefully jailing her, inseminating her for many years to forcefully breed offspring, and Shiki, morally scarred and scared of reality, runs away at the prospect of her mother&#039;s plight. So far so good. <br />
Many years later, Shiki comes back to discover the truth. Guilty because he abandoned his mother and fueled with rage, he storms upon his Uncle and decides to kill him. Using shounen storytelling tropes, of course he is able to escape. Shiki has a mental breakdown after being confronted with all of his mother&#039;s offspring, and loses motivation to kill his uncle. After having Kabane kill all of his mother&#039;s offspring, Shiki decides to spare his Uncle. Using arguments such as &quot;He&#039;ll have a fate worse than death if he lives,&quot; &quot;Killing him won&#039;t bring back my mother,&quot; he decides to spare his Uncle. <br />
What&#039;s wrong with this picture? First of all, I&#039;d really like to point out the timeline of these events. They&#039;re extremely close! Shiki goes through more mental development than an adult would do in their entire life in the span of a few days. He gets over his guilt and trauma, gets over his rage, and becomes and enlightened one over the span of a day or so. It&#039;s extremely surprising to me that he would not, in a fit of rage, just immediately kill his Uncle, but I guess we have the &quot;shounen&quot; genre to thank for that. Sure, could you &quot;reasonably&quot; say that Shiki could have matured so much? Yeah, as much as Ellie could have rationally spared Abby. Again, even Ellie in TLOU2 has around 60 hours of character development while our boy Shiki has 20 minutes, so Ellie&#039;s actions make a bit more sense than Shiki&#039;s. It&#039;s so frustrating seeing how Shiki spares his Uncle without much of a solid reason; his mentality changes way too quickly. He just commanded all of his siblings to die, and yet he&#039;s going to let the perpetrator of all of his pain get away? In fact, you could say that his siblings had no sin, and yet, they took the brunt of his rage, while his actual source of grief and rage is let of scot free. Oh yeah, he&#039;s a better person after killing many innocents because he let his main source of rage go. But wait, his siblings were half monster. Wait a second, he himself is half monster. All of his allies are also half monster. What gives? Well, if you don&#039;t look human, you&#039;re just a monster still! Fire at will. Perfect reasoning. Human looking monster = good, monster looking monster =kill. But wait! They&#039;re less intelligent than humans, so they&#039;re just animals. Yeah, how about we just kill all mentally disabled while we&#039;re at it? <br />
For people thinking that revenge is immature and that Shiki&#039;s reasoning was solid, I&#039;d really like to see how they&#039;d react if they had their loved ones tortured and raped for years before their eyes. There&#039;s not a shred of &quot;well, his Uncle had some good in him,&quot; in which you could perhaps argue for someone like Abby in TLOU2. Again, this is a good example of how the show loves to frame people as &quot;100% good, or 100% bad,&quot; and nothing in between. Or how about the argument that &quot;him living is worse than death because I can deny any sort of future achievements he might have.&quot; Well, killing him would be the absolute fool-proof plan on eliminating any sort of achievements his uncle might have in the future. And you can see, right after the incident, his Uncle isn&#039;t disheartened and is ready to perform atrocities over again. I just hope that Shiki understands that he&#039;s letting his Uncle commit more acts of torture  and allowing more victims to pile up for his own fragile ego.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s go over how Shiki is unable to make his Uncle provide testimony about where his mother&#039;s location is. Instead of any confrontation, Inugami gets convenient plot device in the form of information on his mother. I like how the Uncle gets spared so thoroughly, and how Shiki and his friends are at a loss. Yeah, I can&#039;t imagine just tearing his Uncle limb by limb or doing any sort of torture would unable to extract his mother&#039;s location. I like how it doesn&#039;t even cross his mind even though he should have had the resolve, reason, and drive to do so.<br />
I have so many problems with this story, but I&#039;ll focus on the masking of any moral indictment that this show tries to do with it&#039;s framing of the story. <br />
Kemono Jihen is a story that features killing and murder. Our main characters experience it for good reason. They kill monsters that harm other humans and society as a whole. So what exactly is the morality of our main characters for killing monsters that killed humans, but sparing humans that kill other innocent people? <br />
Monster bad, human good? That&#039;s basically the story Kemono Jihen wants to present. God forbid these kids go killing humans even if they&#039;re monsters inside, but they can go kill monsters for sins that are doing crimes less severe than humans they spare. It also aggravates me in the process of making the story so black and white in determining what is good or bad, it eliminates any sort of mental gymnastics by the viewer. You&#039;re merely being fed &quot;human good, this monster bad, revenge bad.&quot; Everything can be labelled as good or bad without any distinction. <br />
Killing and murder are featured in the story, but the brutality and nastiness of anything macabre is merely glossed over. It&#039;s the same idea where many people are dying, but you don&#039;t get a good sense of how brutal everything is merely because you barely see the killing happen. They just die, and you move on. Just the fact that the brutal act of imprisoning and having his mother being raped continuously to produce over 100 offspring is limited to a few seconds is a tactic that this show employs in order to undermine the &quot;evil acts&#039; that Shiki&#039;s uncle makes, and this sort of masking of violent undertones is always present in this story. Even Kabane&#039;s bullying and frensy backstory are flimsy. These trauma inducing events are extremely short and are barely a blip in the radar for what they are. You&#039;d think that these events would be essential to the story, but they&#039;re glossed because it&#039;s a shounen, and everyone is happy and can move on, apparently. You&#039;re given a narrative that shoves the idea that our main characters are of quite a high moral standing without much thought put into it because again, it&#039;s a shounen. MC good. OK? Even other chilling acts of someone like Kon immediately decapitating Kanabe are just &quot;kids being kids,&quot; &quot;Kanabe didn&#039;t die, so Kon&#039;s all good.&quot; In the end, Kon just becomes good friends and gets invited over to eat. &quot;Well, as long as there are no repercussions, I&#039;ll forgive you.&quot; Cringe. There&#039;s so much atrocities that happen in the show, but it&#039;s just not focused upon and people just get over it. Whether it be on the receiving side or the side giving it out, cruel acts are not questioned or emphasized in the least bit. Instead, it maintains a &quot;lighthearted&quot; tone. Thanks a lot.<br />
I&#039;ll give a shoutout to the other flaws. So in Shiki&#039;s backstory, her mother just complies with his Uncle? She is a monster, a strong one at that, and she just willingly, day by day, gets inseminated and raped by random monsters because Shiki&#039;s uncle tells her to? She doesn&#039;t get any warning signs when she&#039;s being locked in a room and unable to see her son? Oh, what about her barely intelligent offspring. Surely they would be loyal to her, and not the Uncle. Inugami, basically aware of this situation, allows Shiki&#039;s uncle to do whatever he wants for over a year. Inugami&#039;s kind of scummy in that regard. This plot is as secure as swiss cheese, and should not be taken seriously, as once you start combing through the details, you start to realize that this story is only there to serve as character development for Shiki. It not only does not characterize Shiki very well, but it also is just an extremely poorly built backstory and plot that clearly points fingers and the situation is allowed to stay the status quo until Shiki needs character development. <br />
As for other characters, we have our classic vanilla OP MC that doesn&#039;t have a shred of personality. He&#039;s the type character in which &quot;he&#039;s unfeeling,&quot; but also has a &quot;good sense of morality&quot; built into him due to the teachings of his master. Akira is just a flamboyant trap character for comic relief. Shiki, he&#039;s ok, but again, the backstory makes him terrible as well.<br />
Let&#039;s not even talk about how power progression happens. Everything about how powerful people are is a whim that the author decides. Hey, character too weak? Slap a random power up arc so that they&#039;re powerful. In the case of our MC? What do you expect? He&#039;s OP as hell in the very beginning and gets even more OP. It&#039;s not even like Jujutsu Kaisen, where at least our MC has limitations. <br />
Overall, a story that tries to incorporate edgy themes without much thought put into it and tries to maintain the &quot;shounen&quot; more lighthearted tone, and as a result, you get a insincere narrative in which the bad guys and good guys are clearly defined in which their actions don&#039;t quite match their supposed morality.

    Kemono Jihen is a generic version of Kimetsu no Yaiba. <br />
Everything good and bad about KoY is here, but way worse. <br />
<br />
The protagonist, is your  abandoned child monster cliche. No one likes him because he is a mosnter, he never had friends, he does not know who are his parents, and why they&#039;re not there with him anymore. <br />
Instead of having developed some powerfoul/cheefoul/annoying personality like Naruto, he is just BLEND. He does not have any emotions, or opnions about nothing because he just exists like a wall. And yes, is cool at first few moments, but then become BORING and very unpleasant character,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387910">
        with some weird as outcomes like having no remorse to kill, but also having feelings for strange antagonist characters. Or how OP he is because he does not die, and don&#039;t care about pain, but in the end of the day, that does not come so badass as it should. <br />
<br />
His mentor, is a wanna be cowboy bepop with the UGLIEST HAIRCUT  i ever seen, with some unkown power that is &quot;feared&quot; by their villains, but we don&#039;t have any glance of why exacly. <br />
<br />
 His &quot;friends&quot; have a annoying personality and their get a arc for each one of them where you learn about their past. And their past are actually interesting, like how they were abused, or their father figures were so trash. But the development and the conclusion of the arcs are so meh, that you end up not even disliking them or liking then more.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack on this anime, is literally yelling at you &quot; We putting Lisa here, because worked in Kimetsu no Yaiba, so will work here&quot;.<br />
<br />
The desigin on this anime is like &quot; Big eyes, weird long haircuts and tails, worst clothing and we good to go&quot;. The fights are normal, and sometimes the director cuts them off, there is some skulll and blood-ish moments, but man, is just not impressive at all. It&#039;s all about &quot;fire, ice and webs&quot; in the end of the day.<br />
<br />
I only recommend this anime if you&#039;re a enthusiasmatic of a narrative about monster hunters, with childs i guess in the most generic way possible. <br />
<br />
My overall feeling about this anime, is just like his protagonist. Blend. I don&#039;t have any memories about it, and probably will forget about it, as soon the new season starts. <br />
<br />
I am not watching a second season of this show and also not interested in the manga version.  <br />
<br />

    for me this anime is quite interesting to watch, but it&#039;s better if this anime has a little weight, this anime is too light, and the power has no origin it makes me confused, in certain eps Kabane releases his power suddenly I am less attractive to me<br />
<br />
story 5/10<br />
This story has no development at all when I see it, the main character feels that he can control his strength at the beginning which makes me less like him, and I think at the beginning of the episode Kabane can&#039;t control his strength there but suddenly in the next episode he is like not Kabane again<br />
<br />

    I couldn&#039;t wait to dive into this anime and when I did, I found myself hooked to it.This season there are a lot of big name animes which might overshadow this show.Saying that,this is definitely a real gem of an anime.If your looking for a bit of mystery and the supernatural this is a very good show to watch.To me this anime does that perfectly and always keeps you intrigued wanting more.The characters in this show are good and they all serve a purpose,there are no irrelevant characters here.The animation and sound to me seems faultless. It&#039;s a very beautifully executed anime that is very

    This is pretty great, I was about to skip it thinking it&#039;s generic shounenshit, but it turned out to be a mix of modern Japanese Witcher and World of Darkness in anime form, what the hell.<br />
<br />
Obviously anyone who&#039;d enjoy any of above will probably enjoy this. The art is also VERY nice, definitely a cut above the rest though I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s mindblowing, just very high standard.<br />
<br />
Characters are immediately likeable. Story has good pacing that keeps you wanting more without stupid cliffhangers.<br />
<br />
Overall great anime, give it 3 episode rule chance because this guy passes it on the first one.

    I&#039;m going to preface with the fact that I don&#039;t read the manga;<br />
Kemono Jihen is definitely a slept on series with all the great hits we have this anime season. The potential this anime has just seeps out every episode, and some of the arcs while they&#039;re just focusing on character introduction / char development you can really tell this series isn&#039;t afraid to take on extremely dark storylines despite the cute characters &amp; funny moments. <br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, they all have their own personalities and all extremely likable. . . although Kon is best girl.<br />
<br />
Definitely give this anime a shot if you&#039;re craving a

    I was honestly amazed by how much I enjoyed this anime. It&#039;s been a while since I finished it, but Kemono Jihen is definitely up there in terms of my enjoyment. The anime op and ed are S-tier, the art is beautiful, and the characters/relationships are wholesome. With some unexpected mature themes in the story, this anime also has a plot worth delving into. It has a slice of life vibe, but overall shounen. This anime may be for you if you love anime with wholesome content, children, and shounen aspects. Let me know how it is if you do watch it!

    Honestly the art isn&#039;t good enough for me to overlook the flaws of this show. I&#039;m a big fan of supernatural detective stories, especially when those are about urban legends. This show just doesn&#039;t do it for me. The pacing is all over the place, the pay-off doesn&#039;t hit, it&#039;s straight up boring at times, the characters are nothing new. I&#039;ll keep watching to see if its still gonna end up being worth it. The first episode had some amazing horror elements that reminded me of Shiki the Anime, but that gets shoved away for demon slayer-shounen-knock off plotlines. The horror of the first episode

    The meaning of the word &quot;underrated&quot; in general aspects is:<br />
&quot;Not rated or valued highly enough.&quot;<br />
Kemono jihen unfortunately fullfills the meaning of this. And hey what can you do about it?, there are a lot of unrecognized anime everywhere, other franchises, that may not be bad, but they are definitely not what people say they are (mha) have amazingly high scores, I have seen a lot of them. The thing that bothers me the most is the fact that Kemono Jihen has EVERYTHING to be a successful and well received shounen, yet is quite unknowed having only 87,912 reviews and a score of 7.44 being ranked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405918">
        in the 1803th place. I dont know if it has anything to do with winter season that brought renowned anime names (SNK, Re: zero, dr stone, horimiya,etc) but its just sad to see such a good anime being overshadowed that badly. <br />
Anyways sorry for the long introduction to the review, im finally gonna start<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
I personally was immersed in the story since the first two chapters; the world that develops is surprisingly well done, bringing a ot of concepts that i would like to believe will be more developed later on the story. <br />
Lets start off saying that its not an &quot;original&quot; story , but it works well. As an example, JJK managed to highlight so much, not for its original story, but because its entertaining and has a good functionality, its story works perfectly to present villians, develop characters, and bringing good fights. And thats pretty much what Kemono Jihen does, obviously not at that extreme but you get the point. Although clearly its not the strong point of the show, but it accomplishes its duty. Its a good start for the series, nothing innovating or refreshing, but still pretty good<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
Probably the best thing of the show. Let me start off saying that theyre wholesome, the friendship that they have, their personalities, everything about them is pure awesomeness.<br />
The first season pretty much covers Shiki and Akiras arc and thats when we get to know what are their goals, how their pasts afects how theyre now, why they do what they do to achieve what they want, how everything that hapenned to them is linked on the things they say, act or feel. We really get to understand what theyre going throught and genuinly feel bad for them. <br />
As for kanabe i liked him a lot as a protagonist, he doesnt know much about &quot;real&quot; life due to the life he had, he knows the general aspects and meaning of things but cannot fully understand them. Watching him grow and learning what love is, what friendship is, that he wants to do things, is just amazinggg.<br />
They all have complexity and a great development, and theyre really easy to empathize with<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
I have nothing bad to say about this, everything was really good, but nothing impressive (although i really liked the op and ed)<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
the fightssss *cheff kiss*, and alsoo I really liked the setting and the tone of it, it was really good, for moments you feel like laughing, and for moments youre actually scared. I really liked the use of gore it was not a little, but it also wasnt excessibly to the point of not surprising you. I liked everything that had to do with the art (The only reason of it being not a 10 is because ive seen better)<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
(just because i found some parts a little boring<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
I really really enjoyed it a lot (to the point of writing  review), if youre looking something entertaining, funny, sad, quite epic and just good, you should definitely give it a try. Also, dont have high hopes or any shit like that just because of the review, i personally enjoyed it, and if it&#039;s not your case, well what a shame

    Many anime fall flat in terms of story, characters, and depth this anime is no different. Kemono Jihen is just something to watch when bored. It doesn&#039;t lack in originality but that does not make it great. Everything is pretty average in terms of animation, ost, and characters. The tone changes throughout episodes which creates a disconnect. One episode can be about traumatizing events and the next can be about an eight-year-old in a crop top. The main Characters have complete story arcs but they fell flat in terms of depth (maybe due to the 12 episode time frame). In conclusion, Kemono Jihen is an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402052">
        average anime with an average plot and characters.

    Love this show. Very underrated. Could see myself rewatching this.<br />
<br />
- This show balances being a darker shounen with more lighthearted scenes, which honestly is what I always dreamed shounen could be growing up.<br />
<br />
- Similar vibes as Demon Slayer. The main downside is that this show doesn&#039;t have as good an animation/soundtrack, unfortunately, which causes issues with feeling invested in the emotional scenes sometimes. But I actually prefer the overarching plotline and character arcs in this one.<br />
<br />
- The characters. Are. Amazing. What&#039;s particularly cool is that since Kabane is a blank slate, as he spends time with each of the characters he gains some of their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389612">
        tendencies and ideologies. And this can be seen over the course of the season. The characters have seen much love and care from the author, as each is given their own set of motives that they actually act upon.<br />
<br />
- Avoids some anime tropes. E.g. in most anime, if you have two characters that are strangers walking down a hallway together, they&#039;ll usually have some cringey dialogue-- but here, the characters as you would expect in RL, don&#039;t say a word to each other! Magical.<br />
<br />
- The show ends on a cliffhanger, so expecting a season 2.

    I was impressed by the first episode. There was a thrill and impact to the way the detective tested the kid Kabane to determine his disposition, Kabane&#039;s circumstances were intriguing. Even in Anime it&#039;s not everyday a guy just shoots a kid in the head at point blank range, especially when the dude has been set up as one of the &quot;good guys&quot;. Least of all, where the kid just smiles, utterly chill about it - trying to make the dude feel better about the whole thing just in case he has trauma/guilt or something later since I&#039;ll just be dead anyways. You actually couldn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388044">
        be 100% at that time, whether the guy with the gun was going to be the main character or whether this kid was going to undead himself somehow. The whole episode gave off that weird creepy intrigue you want a supernatural journey through some shadow world to have. There was a clear differentiation by way of contrast between the two main characters and the humans who had hired the one guy that shot the kid. Hot DAMN, I thought. That was cool, pleasantly surprised at the quality of the show - wonder where they&#039;re going with this, I thought...<br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s the issue. Where they go is a silly place known as The Kemonist&#039;s Office. Supposedly mediating issues that arise between humans and murderous furry of the week as some kind of appendage to local law enforcement, which is under the complete and total control of a somewhat evil foxy lady Kemono anyways so raison d&#039;etre unclear. Most of the story is centered on this one trap kid and yung spidey, the kids already enrolled in Kemonist daycare when Kabane shows up. They both get arcs, those arcs basically take up the whole season - except for Kon, her thing is she&#039;s dumb, and she gets left in a park and waits there for the rest of the series as the Kemonist&#039;s battle against Mr. Freeze - the trap kid&#039;s brother.<br />
<br />
There is just something not quite right about the framing - why are they all kids? Why is one a trap? Why is the racoon girl such an idiot? Why is the evil head of the police department so scary but so completely, conveniently impotent when it comes to the Kemonist guy? Why is there a video-game addicted vampire living in the closet? You know what the problem is - I don&#039;t care why. I just, don&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Honorable mention - yung spidey has some character development of mild interest during his arc, and in interacting with the omnipotent MMO guild master vampire living in the clost. Also in the show&#039;s favor, there&#039;s some cool fight mechanics sprinkled here and there, and Kon&#039;s replacement does pretty well for himself as a wunderkinds who is playing double agent one way or another and you can&#039;t tell 100% which way... but honestly the villains are lame, nearly across the board. There&#039;s literally no tension, it&#039;s about as suspenseful as an episode of care bears. I found the backstories for the Kemono races flat as hell, sometimes almost an afterthought - like the vampire MMO guy, &quot;vampire&#039;s are an advanced race, even among Kemono&quot;. Tsk.<br />
<br />
What began as a surprisingly mature first step into an intriguing lore, ended up being exactly the kind of show I was afraid it was going to be when I saw all those kids striking dynamic poses on the poster. It&#039;s not outright bad to be fair, but I didn&#039;t get what they did here personally. If I had been expecting a slice of life, kooky kids doing grown up things so cute type of show - maybe it would earn higher marks in that category. Overall not my jam, wouldn&#039;t recommend.

    When I found out about this anime, it is often compared to Tokyo Ghoul and Demon Slayer. So, 2 days after the release of the first episode, I decided to finally watch it. And wth, the first episode already caught my attention.<br />
<br />
When it comes to watching anime, I always try to know its concept. For example, Tokyo Ghoul has ghouls in the human world, Demon Slayers has demons or Attack on Titan has Titans. Then it is up to their respective authors to play with the plot. Kemono Jihen did not fail to catch my attention. It&#039;s concept of Kemonos got me wanting to watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387801">
        more of it. Based on the first season (hoping there&#039;s a season 2), the author played with the plot well.<br />
<br />
The characters are actually lovable. Kabane who was treated badly for all his life knowing the world full of love with Inugami, Inugami who runs the kemono agency, Shiki who has anger issues but still lovable and Akira as a lovable clumsy person. The characters are all so dynamic and their stories are capable with so many possibilities. <br />
<br />
The last episode actually got me sad since we only get 12 episodes for this. I&#039;m crossing my fingers for Season 2 :D
