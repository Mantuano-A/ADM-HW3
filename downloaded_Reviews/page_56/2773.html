    Tower of Druaga is a two-season anime (Aegis of Uruk - 1st season; Sword of Uruk - 2nd season) that isn’t anything spectacular, but manages to deliver great fun and enjoyment. Each season haves 12 episodes but season one has an extra episode, it’s an alternative version of the first episode. This is only funny stuff but explains some things so I recommend watching it. <br />
<br />
Mainly I’m going to review Sword of Uruk but there are going to be some comparations and references to Aegis of Uruk so this could be considered the full anime review. Firstly I must say that I don’t usually watch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14114">
        this type of anime. This is the typical “save everyone” character (incredibly stupid at that) that has to save the world by defeating a great evil at the top of a tower. Pretty common story huh? Well don’t be fooled because the anime gets really interesting at the end of the first season and literally forces you quickly jump into the second one because you desperately want to know what happens next.<br />
<br />
The story is set on a medieval/fantasy world that seems somehow modern. The events revolve around Jill, the main character, and his struggle to get to the top of the Tower Of Druaga. Those who climb the tower are called “climbers”, there are lots of climbers although the series focuses on some especifics groups of them. In Aegis of Uruk the characters will usually find themselves in really absurd and funny situations. In fact the 1st season doesn’t get serious ‘till the last 3 episodes. Sword of Uruk gets serious at the beginning and unfolds a story that is a lot more dramatic than Aegis of Uruk. It&#039;s a story full of hate and betrayal.<br />
<br />
In Aegis of Uruk Jill is a rookie climbing for the first time. He thinks he is climbing to defeat the evil god Druaga but his brother (Neeba) has other plans. First Jill gets dismissed from his party and joins another one with very funny and important characters in it, Kaaya being the most important. At the end, when they reach the top another conflict unfolds and Neeba leaves alone joined by Kaaya. Sword of Uruk plotline unfolds six months after the events in Aegis of Uruk (3 years inside the tower due to some flow of time issues) the story is less funny and more serious, it concludes the anime for real. The battles are more fierce and the drama more intense. The objetive is basically the same: climb the tower again to reach another one (Mythical Tower) and defeat another evil being.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is the pace in which the story develops. In Aegis of Uruk the story feels fast while the party climbs the shirines and gardens. In one episode they are on level two shirine and in the next one the party magically appears on level five. In Sword of Uruk the story is more paused and seems to be slower. It goes on in a more drama-oriented, detailed way. The story has it twists, almost all of them happening at the end of the first season and in the second season.<br />
<br />
I was fooled when I first saw the Aegis of Uruk opening on the second episode. The opening has some amazing sequences that are really well done, but have nothing to do with the real anime, only some character behaviors are loyal to the anime plot. Sword of Uruk has some “nothing-to-do –with-the-anime” sequences as well. The two openings are just fun to watch and the design of every little thing is beautiful. Theese work like fanservice but at the same time indicate that the anime is far from serious, being it mostly a comedy.<br />
<br />
Overall the anime looks good. The spaces are diverse and go from lively and beautiful to dark and scary. The main leads are very well detailed and very distinctive from each other. From Kaaya to Fatima the girls look gorgeous and really do make a diference from other animes girls. But some things like Jill’s armor and weapons are poorly detailed. On the first episode you see Jill with this huge shield, but after he leaves his first party he get’s to wield a really lame tiny shield. Another thing is the sword that he get’s from Kaaya: you only see it on the first season and them in the second season only in the last 3 episodes, and it isn’t anything special. I was hoping for a more powerful and mythical looking weapon (with some sort of power?) The only weapon I liked was the flame staff-gun that Fatima wields; it’s really awesome and original. The monsters are varied as well: they can be lame and simple looking or really ferocious and complex. I was as well dissapointed with Druaga’s looks. <br />
<br />
As I said before the openings of boths seasons are just creative and beautiful. The singles that acompain the openings are really good as well. The music is completetly different from the one that is inputed during the anime. These are J-Pop songs that, after listening two or three times, become incredibly adictive. On the other hand the endings are slow and tranquil. So the basic formula: an agitated and fast opening to start up the action and to end up a light and somehow sad single to leave the animation on a nice mood.<br />
<br />
The BMGs are really dramatic and have that medieval/legendary feeling. These give more drama to battles and more enjoyment to the, pretty random, humor moments. The sound quality is awesome and the BMG’s sound like taken out from a movie. The seiyuu cast is awesome as well and do irradiate each personality with their voices.<br />
<br />
Everything is varied and fantastic in the world of The Tower of Druaga, the characters are no exception. In Aegis of Uruk there are a lot of interesting characters and in the Sword of Uruk you get to see all theese characters again and some new additions. Again the girls look awesome and sexy, Fatima being my favourite. Definitely I love Kaaya’s personality, she’s just weird and likes things that nobody else likes, she doesn’t get bothered by nothing and works really hard. On the other hand Fatima is an aggressive girl that gets bothered by practically anything but works hard as well. These two characters suffer a transformation after Aegis of Uruk ends. In Sword of Uruk Fatima starts up being a lay down and really quiet girl. Kaaya doesn’t show up too much until the last episodes but she seems sad and quiet as well. <br />
<br />
But characters like Jill, suffers minimal changes. He starts up the second season sad and gloomy, but when he gets to know how to get where Kaaya and Neeba are he regains that irritating “save everyone” actitude. The problem is that he is indecisive and isn’t aware of anything at times. In my opinion a bad main character.<br />
<br />
The main thing about secondary and other less important main leads is that they do have an important development and are not left alone. They do have important roles in the story development and one’s never kept wandering where a certain character is: they all participate and develop amanzingly well in the story.<br />
<br />
At the end The Tower of Druaga is an enjoyable anime. It doesn’t have a strong story or great animation either but everything else make up for it. The anime has a big enjoyment factor: when you finish the first season you’ll quickly jump to the second one. And when you finish the second season you will end up loving the anime, mostly because of the relationships between the characters. I really enjoyed Tower of Druaga and I recommend everyone to watch this, you’ll get to laugh a bit, to experince sad moments and to, most impotantly, appreciate everything  this world has to offer.

    The Sword of Uruk diverges rather heavily from its prequel. Instead of &quot;everyone happily going on a hiking trip&quot;, the story is centered more on betrayal and vengeance - PG style. Unfortunately, the animation quality hasn&#039;t improved much from season one, but they have finally stopped cramming in weaksauce CG like Gonzo&#039;s previous projects (ie. Druggynaut, BlAss-rater, etc.). Fans of season one are more likely to enjoy this due to the obvious reason of &quot;sequel&quot;, but they are enough flashbacks to make season one optional. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
Hokay, so its no longer a secret that Fatina is so bangin&#039; hot and every man in Uruk wants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11328">
        to have her babies. But not even the Scarlett Johansson of Meskia can keep us entertained if all the fights in this show look like Street Fighter Alpha. Hell even Pokemon had more exciting battles. So... what I mean to say is don&#039;t expect any Soul Caliber from this show. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Fairly catchy OP, although most of the attractiveness is in the form of a smokin&#039; hot blonde mage (magess?). There&#039;s really not much to say about the sound, cuz honestly, who cares?<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
If there is one redeeming aspect of the Sword of Uruk, it would be the addition of new characters, as well as the expansion of previous ones. One gripe I had with season one was the shallow-ness of the entire cast. This just... happened, no one knew, no one asked, no one explained. This time around, there is some back-story to explain the reasons for the characters&#039; actions in season one. As random as they may be, any explanation is better than no explanation. Jil forming a new party with Neeba&#039;s old comrades was a good move since it gave an opportunity for them to say things that they couldn&#039;t in season one. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
To be honest, I probably wouldn&#039;t have enjoyed this show if it wasn&#039;t for Fatina. There must be something about that bangin&#039; hot body that makes me laugh at all the lame gaffs in this show. For those of you who don&#039;t like hardcore, bloodthirsty, action animes I high recommend you to give this a look. Ditto for those of you with a soft spot for tsundere blondes.<br />
<br />
And oh yea, Fatina is a hottie.<br />

    Hmmmmmmmm, what to say about this anime. I thought it was &quot;alright&quot;. Nothing compared to the first season, which I enjoyed WAY more. I&#039;m gonna try to keep this spoiler free, but that may be hard to. <br />
<br />
Story - 6 <br />
The story for ToD had POTENTIAL. But it lost it for me. Most of the episodes felt like a burden to watch, and I only watched cause I wanted to see the end. There&#039;s Jil and his friends climbing the tower, little girl with some back ground story following them, and then some things happen etc etc. But what I HATED about it was how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13527">
        DULL they made it all. It all seemed so familiar like I was watching the same episode over and over. And then when things do change up, it&#039;s some type of stupid plot twist. If you decide to watch the ending, you will see what I&#039;m talking about. <br />
<br />
Art-8 <br />
I liked the art, it was colorful, it was nice, and the action scenes were well done. But you know what kills a good fight scene? Crappy CG monster models. Seriously, that KILLED it for me. At first I thought &quot;Oh, they trying to do more like they did with the Druaga fight from the first season&quot;. But it looked pretty stupid at most parts, and it rarely got better. May sound like I&#039;m wailing on it, but to be truthfull, the CG was the only thing that bugged me besides the story plot.<br />
<br />
Sound-9<br />
I liked the voice acting and the action sounds were fitting. Never really much to talk about in this area.<br />
<br />
Characters-10<br />
Best part of the anime. The unique characters. To be honest, some of them just sucked, but than they decided to give us gold in the form of Fatina and Melt. My favorite thing about the whole show is how they all seemed to have their positions in the plot. This character is the nagger, this character is leader, this character is gonna be a bitch. Reminded me of an MMO. Real diverse, and filled with jerks. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-7<br />
It was kinda hard to enjoy because of the story, but I still managed to give it a 7 (which stands for gooooooooood). It was dull and boring at some points, but than theres points where I thought to my self &quot;this anime is worth my time&quot; and in a way, it was. The jokes are funny, most of the actions scenes are well done, and the characters are well built. As long as you don&#039;t mind the CG monsters and the rather boring story line (Untill you get to the end. There you can decide if it was worth it all or not) this anime was good.<br />
<br />
Overall, I rate this anime a 7. Worth my time, but wasn&#039;t all that great. <br />

    It&#039;s generic fantasy done fairly well on the surface, but ultimately it&#039;s a hollow experience which reeks of missed potential. Though I haven&#039;t really spoiled anything explicit, I do refer to a fair amount of events in this review, so it won&#039;t be for those who don&#039;t want to know any details of what they&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
Plenty of SoU&#039;s merit rests on our shared experiences with the characters from the previous season. It also does a satisfying job of tying things from AoU&#039;s storyline into this one, though unfortunately it fails to improve on AoU&#039;s foundation or deliver satisfying resolutions of its own. SoU started off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183440">
        pretty strong, with an exciting build-up in the first two episodes as the old crew gets reunited, and some fun adventures through exotic landscapes and fiendish new enemies in the more threatening Mythical Tower, culminating in the somewhat emotional 7th episode which was in my view the high point of the series. Some of the characters here receive interesting glimpses of characterization and there&#039;s hope that the story will continue to do things with them. And yet, by its end the show has devolved into a chaotic, ugly blend of clichés, yet more boring betrayals and often shaky dialogue whilst seeming to take itself far too seriously for the crap that it&#039;s giving you. It features a very weak and kind of ridiculous &quot;battle against heaven&quot; and unimaginative fights lacking the animational potency or enough unconventional features to be interesting.<br />
<br />
The most frustrating aspect of the DRUAGA story is that none of the characters ever received as much investment and care as we could have hoped: At the end of the day they&#039;re just vocational &quot;Climbers&quot; who seem to do it without even needing an objective, apparently because there&#039;s so little else to do in their world. This is pretty aptly conveyed by the point at which Utu, carrying a wounded Fatina, angrily demands to know why they&#039;re putting themselves through all of this to follow Jil, and what his reason is for going on (out of the blue, after seeming perfectly fine with not having an objective this whole time). I could only put my head into my hands when Jil replied &quot;because I&#039;m a Climber&quot;, with both of his sidekicks seeming mightily impressed by his response and no longer questioning what the hell they&#039;re doing. There are a huge amount of characters all aiming to reach the top, but all this does is weaken the focus (that might have been used to make core characters more interesting) and muddy the waters as to who wants what, or most importantly why they want it.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day the show just fails to get you to care enough about the characters given that their purpose, backstory and aims seem so empty and unexplored. The old crew are by the end of the season your typical auxiliaries who can&#039;t really participate in the end battle alongside Jil by dint of not being the &quot;chosen ones&quot;, so they ended up pretty much spectating. The deaths of a few mostly forgettable side characters really fail to make things feel more serious, while lazy writing ensures that some characters don&#039;t even receive any worthy closure to their stories at all, and feel utterly pointless. Betrayals will also have as little effect on the characters as they do on you and we can&#039;t even relate to the characters because of how undeveloped they are, how ambiguous their blank faces are about their emotional states, and how little detail we have upon their motives when they make decisions which often don&#039;t seem logical. Female characters are mostly seen falling for male ones, being rescued or fighting supportively rather than independently so there&#039;s nothing refreshing there, while the &#039;chosen couple&#039; is also very bland, given their dull personalities and almost universal lack of real bonding between them throughout either of the two seasons, with most of us inevitably having opted for Fatina over Kaaya.<br />
<br />
What kept TToD - SoU alive is that it remained a pretty fun adventure, it was easily watchable and had a nice atmosphere almost entirely thanks to its good OP&#039;s and ED&#039;s - these are graced by fun songs that draw you into the world a bit more and wrap each episode in nostalgic, magical feelings. I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s because of these feelings and the (albeit somewhat primitive) connections we established with Fatina, Utu, Melt and Coopa that we&#039;re all a little sad to leave the world of Uruk for good. Despite this, it just didn&#039;t manage to make its best characters more than fun sidekicks for the most part, or to make its story compelling enough given how unclear and shallow the reasons behind everything relating to the plot are. It suffers from the same weaknesses of its predecessor in the domain of animation (gaping lack of facial expressions) and just doesn&#039;t really have what it takes to be a superior anime. With attempts at humour that are passable but no real improvement on its predecessor, it&#039;s as if SoU tries to be lots of things but in the end doesn&#039;t really do anything that well.<br />
<br />
4.5/10

    ----Rundown:<br />
1) Pros<br />
- Good story<br />
- Solid characters<br />
- Story is told mainly from 3 point of views<br />
<br />
2)Cons<br />
-Bad art , and i mean bad (excessive use of CGI, bad animated faces)<br />
-Not much of a satisfying end <br />
<br />
*Overall 9/10<br />
The tower of druage is a great anime overall , great story, good characters, decent art.<br />
It is sad to see that the animation aspect is full with crappy CGI and really bad drawn expression &quot;faces&quot;, the anime could have been literally in my favorites if it hasn&#039;t been for this annoying downside.<br />
<br />
If i have to sum it up : high caliber story with bad execution!<br />
<br />
*Story 9/10<br />
The story is interesting as it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169217">
        is told but the &quot;brave hero king&quot; point of view in many cases, his Rationalization for his actions which are raise a philosophical dilemma at points mixed with glimpses of his heroic past are really interesting for me to watch.<br />
Also told from the hero Jil POV coupled with his brother Neeba (not much maybe just half an episode) which give us yest another way to look at the current situation from different set of eyes and circumstances.<br />
The story pretty much follows the first part which i wish not so spoil as you &quot;the reader&quot; might have not seen.<br />
<br />
*Art 4/10<br />
Bad , just bad.<br />
The overuse of CGI really repulses me, alot of the pivotal points could have been drawn in a way better style that makes you just go awe!<br />
This is definitely the shows weakest point, i really wish if they picked another studio or something :(<br />
<br />
*Sound 7/10<br />
Nothing special here.<br />
<br />
*Voice acting 5/10 <br />
Medicore, no feelings and no stimulation it felt so generic which makes me really sad and frustrated at times.

    What the hell happened?<br />
<br />
Those four words generally sum up my disbelief at the second season. Granted I know this show isn&#039;t a beacon of comedy, I understand that but holy crow did they ever suck the humor out of this show, except for the third episode you may be hard-pressed to find any sort of humor in this season, it&#039;s like the creators decided no we&#039;re not going to include any comedy in this season. Without the comedy this show ultimately suffers, the pacing starts to slow the show down considerably and you feel like watching this show is almost like a chore instead of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24847">
        something you want to watch.<br />
<br />
But I have to digress, the Voice acting is sharp, However, I think it&#039;s a shame Melt does not have as many lines as he did in the first one and thus the comedic factor is lost. The leads do a great job though but sometimes it feels as if they are sleep walking through the script.<br />
<br />
Nothing bad to say about the animation, it&#039;s really gorgeous and it seems that reducing the amount of CGI helped the show for the better.<br />
<br />
As for the new characters I have to say I was dissapointed, without trying to spoil anything I have to admit I was suprised with Henaro, I never saw that coming, that character was well done. Elevating Utu and Fatina to major characters helps the show out a lot, and it&#039;s great there is a new group this time instead of the previous group. The Four Coffin Knights were not interesting. I have to say I ended up caring for none of them including Mite.<br />
<br />
So frankly I have to say that I wish GONZO had thought harder about how to write the Second Season because it felt rushed and at times incomplete.<br />

    Well just like some other people have said they made a decent sized gap from where they ended to where they are starting again. The new attitude of Fatina made me really happy when I noticed she calmed down and wasn&#039;t so prissy anymore. I extremely enjoyed the first season although I could have done without some of the comical satire they aired in the first two episodes. Overall I can see this anime going places. The artwork pleased me just as much as the first season as well as most of the other aspects of it.<br />
<br />
I would definitely say give the anime a chance.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11493">
        It has excellent potential to glue viewers to their seats.<br />
<br />
And obviously watch the first season before you try to watch this or you will have no idea what&#039;s going on :)

    Irony. Harsh or not, unbelievable or not, this word describes this season of Druaga perfectly. Normally I would be against such a broad generalization, but as I was writing the rest of the review, no matter how much I struggled, how much I fought against it, every respect of this season always came back to it, and in the end I had to relinquish all my hopes.<br />
<br />
Even while holding true to this concept, don’t rush to judgments, Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is an overall enjoyable experience, and does indeed have strong points worth mentioning, this is undisputable. Instead the question about this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19194">
        season is how well a show that ends every string of events in contradiction with itself, can manage to remain entertaining despite its ups and downs.<br />
<br />
Some traits of the first season are obviously carried here, but other than the introduction and the cast all the rest is pretty well hidden under layers and layers of “safe plot devices”, and all the drifting between genres that existed has been streamlined, but saying more here would make my first statement devoid of purpose, so I will hold the conclusion for when I am not specifically writing an introduction.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that I will avoid repetition by rushing through some aspects that remained unchanged from the previous season, reading my other review before hand would be advised (but not mandatory).<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Story<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
The main aim of a sequel is to move the plot forward, and in this respect Druaga delivers. The problem makes itself apparent when we start worrying about character development, dilemmas, and a few other crucial aspects that usually a good plot is compromised of, and these are all seldom scattered throughout the episodes, never shinning enough to make the predictive nature of this season go anywhere interesting. It hints otherwise every now and then, but ultimately it boils down to the safest way to create just enough attrition for the plot to not stagnate completely.<br />
<br />
This is where the irony begins. If you watch the very first (and wonderful) episode of the first season and the very last one of the second season you will cringe and run away. Luckily this doesn’t happen right at first so you can enjoy the momentum quite well, and while it lasts details like the characters having no coherent reasoning behind any of their actions, the plot unfolding like it’s chained on trails with holes the size of canyons and expectations being crushed with every single dialogue line seems minor, and if you have happened to grow enough affection for the protagonists even reasonable.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the story is one aspect that degraded from the first part of the show, and as awkward as it might be, they borrowed heavily from the worse aspects while leaving the bare minimum of the good ones. It is still enjoyable if you are looking to find out what happens with the characters, but without this previous emotional bound to them, I find it hard to believe anyone else would be able appreciate it as much.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Art / Animation &amp; Sound<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s is pretty much the same as the first one, strong character design, vivid colors and weak motion animation summarize it perfectly, including both the 2D and CGI aspects of it as well as the unevenness that plagued the first season. The sound also didn’t drop the bar below what we have seen before, with the possible exception of the intro song that I found to be marvelous (not to mention addictive), as well as the animation that accompanies it that is at the same time top quality and refreshing.<br />
<br />
The main gripe here lies in the fact that the animation quality doesn’t follow the climax of the plot, in other words, non important sequences get bumped up in quality, while the decisive ones are plagued with out-of-context CGI, stock footage (tons of it) and stiff character motion, and the more the climax escalates the worse it gets, culminating on a terribly weak decisive battle, that is not only incredibly predictable, but thanks to the animation pretty dull as well.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Characters<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
The first season had the habit of performing drastic changes on character mid way thought it, but this is all long gone. Characters here start and finish at the same place going back two steps every time they move one forward. But perhaps this is not the best metaphor to describe it, since in reality they are so stagnant throughout the whole story, that from time to time the only noticeable difference from scene A to scene B, is in their dialogues and to whom they are talking to at the moment.<br />
<br />
The outcome might be a bit iffy, but they try really hard (really Hard!) to make this as epic as possible. They throw in tragedies one after the other, make ground shaking battles at every opportunity with over proportioned explosions (including even atomic mushrooms!) and create the most awkward romantic interactions I have ever seen, just trying to raise the emotional relevance of everything, and the irony here is that they try so much so many different things, one end up getting in the way of the other instead of improving them overall.<br />
<br />
They do attempt to give motivation to the enemies and feelings to the people that eventually die (something somewhat lacking in the first season), but since they have to share screen time with the six to seven main characters and still throw in detractions in the form of redundant characters that conveniently disappear from the plot, nude bath scenes for pure fanservice (tons and tons of them), and even a few remnants of humor from the last season, what we end up getting is an indecisive pile of  expectations without much delivering.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Value<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said, it is unusual for me to be able to resume a season of a show in one word, but irony fits so perfectly in every aspect that I can’t help myself. This fact alone is bad, and if a characteristic like this was this abundantly present on the first season, I probably wouldn’t have got around watching the second one, but since it is not the case, the bonds with the cast helps us endure the bad times and enjoy the good ones out of reasonable proportion.<br />
<br />
Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is a worthy sequel where it counts, and even if it loses some of the qualities the first part had, the remains still deliver a coherent follow up and an outcome adequate for the people that enjoyed the first season. Despite the fact that many (myself included) will have to forgive a few disappointments to truly enjoy it, it is still recommended for the ones that liked the first part. The characters still manage to remain interesting and this subjective asset alone holds our interest in the unfolding of the tale persistently, even if it might perish with the last blows dealt by the ending.<br />

    well  I  have to say  if  your a huge RPG  or slash &amp; hack fan  , then your  probably going to like this series.it  is in essence   one big  long and  entertaining dungeon  crawl.<br />
There are plenty of twists, betrayals and  campy  style  humor  and action to  hold  your attention  through out, a few Boromir  scenes as well , if you catch my drift.<br />
<br />
Story. not  bad  , not great  but  not terrible either.<br />
<br />
Art-  also pretty good and yes , let

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28970">
        it be said , that   Fartina  is  one  smoking  hot  mage babe.They got that part   right.<br />
 <br />
<br />
sound-  well done and well acted.<br />
<br />
character- the second series , does  a much Better  job of developing  the characters with back story and  what have you but  honestly  not enough . This story  could and should have been EPIC but  unfortunately its not.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-yes  i did , i really enjoyed the series and its  fulfilling conclusion.It does drag  a bit in places and what have you  but with  all that ,Its a  an anmie  worthy of your  time.

    The second season of Druaga kept me more invested than the previous season, having a slightly more interesting twist in the story and a decent outcome.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t feel overly impressed or enchanted by the whole entry, but found no major faults in it either besides some loose ends at the conclusion and some disagreements with the main character.<br />
<br />
The premise is essentially sibling rivalry with a lot thrown on to it, with brothers Ji and Neeba fighting it out. <br />
<br />
Ji is the lawful good entry and Neeba teetering from true to neutral to chaotic neutral and eventually...evil in some capacity or another.<br />
<br />
I found the main character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182372">
        to be insufferably stupid and naive on occasion; not to say that unless every lead has to be a labyrinth of emotion and thought or Machiavellian, but the heroic ideal that he embodies seems to clearly hinder his progress for little more than thinly-veiled egotism that&#039;s never addressed or worse, seemingly encouraged as part of the tone and message. <br />
Child-like innocence and ignorance make for great contrasts to gradual transitions in a long-term arc, but I felt that without a few secondary characters bluntly stating &quot;Man, that Ji guy has come a long way&quot; I would&#039;ve scarcely seen that major of a change between episode two and twenty. <br />
<br />
This is a bit of a minor point and I think one that might be more personal than anything. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching the series and would recommend it to someone that wanted a lighter anime that wasn&#039;t too cliche or trope-ridden to be un-watchable.   It accomplishes what it sets out to do with (mostly) fun characters and a weight that while mostly fantastical in tone and nature, still delivers a few mild punches to the viewer that weren&#039;t entirely expected.

    Without seeing season one you can&#039;t get the complexities of the second. Only with the fist half can this be considered an actual full story; unlike some anime that can be segmented into there own separate stories. This time around everything has a very serious mood or feeling though the whole thing. Then also has ending actually is capped off really well by giving everything and everyone a clear resolution to their characters story to that point. While having it&#039;s very serious and surreal atmosphere the whole time it successfully is able to delivers it&#039;s fair share of funny moments. With this I feel it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214117">

    TL;DR Watch it for the characters and their relationships with each other.<br />
<br />
This is an anime that everyone should watch, but not because it is the greatest anime ever or even one of the top 50. <br />
<br />
When watching Tower of Druaga you&#039;ll probably say something like &quot;Why am I even watching this? Are these characters even developing?&quot; and &quot;What&#039;s keeping me here?&quot; <br />
<br />
This is because what&#039;s special about Tower of Druaga is that there really is no main character. And this makes it brilliant. <br />
<br />
Jil is a kind of focus, for sure, but he really doesn&#039;t have all that much screentime and we get Neeba, Gilgamesh,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review236089">
        and Ethana side stories all the time. Tower of Druaga doesn&#039;t really spend that much time developing the backstories of all these characters and instead presents them to you as human beings that you have to learn about from their actions. Because of the limited points of view and lack of introspection, the main judgements of these characters comes from their actions and not their intentions.<br />
<br />
Tower of Druaga is a grown up world in which all actions have consequences that aren&#039;t hand waved away. People&#039;s fights and attachments to characters are never forgotten and continually shape their relationships. Furthermore the show doesn&#039;t give you any Deus ex machinas and all the characters are reasonably powered. This is really a show about watching a group of characters interacting with each other than it is about that group against the world. What&#039;s special about Tower of Druaga as opposed to something like Grimgar is that the viewer is NOT a part of that group. Druaga is like reading history or watching documentary footage. You get the feeling that these characters have a full background of experience and reasons for everything that&#039;s made them the way they are today. And these reasons cannot be explained or shown in one or two or even 24 episodes. Druaga makes me wonder about why a person did X instead of telling me why or me simply not believing it. All of the characters have their own valid reasons for everything they do and aren&#039;t just sucked into a protagonist&#039;s story.<br />
<br />
Besides the characters, that I could on forever about, what makes this anime great is that it EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES. So often, I watch a show and just wish that a character would do something, anything, that would lead to more complicated relationships and greater depth. Like, imagine if Kirito had to kill Asuna halfway through the series. Or if Inuyasha left Kagome for 6 months and went travelling with Kikyo instead. These kinds of developments would add so much depth. When I watch Tower of Druaga I can&#039;t resign myself to thinking that everyone&#039;s safe or that X person will do probable actions. There are SPOILER multiple betrayals but these also don&#039;t result in just anger. Characters betray and re-betray each other all the time, because EVERYONE IS ACTING IN THEIR OWN INTEREST just like regular humans do. Tower of Druaga takes the leaps that everyone else either doesn&#039;t consider or is too afraid to do.<br />
<br />
Sure the art&#039;s blah, there&#039;s cgi, the script is whatevs.<br />
<br />
Sorry, one second. RELATIONSHIP SPOILER!<br />
<br />
They take the leap to have MC have complicated relationships with more than one female. Not &#039;tsundere instant fall in love&#039; or &#039;they obviously like each other, come on&#039;, but complicated relationships of mutual trust and affection and I love it. <br />
<br />
This anime may not be the most fun to watch, but it certainly is very interesting. Its characters are so interesting (at least to me) and their interactions with each other are stronger and more developed than any other show I&#039;ve watched (besides Bebop). Druaga tells its best stories but not telling you its story. What&#039;s unsaid between the characters is where the gold comes from, (like Cowboy Bebop).<br />
<br />
You may not fall off your chair every episode, and you may not cry at every death (did I mention that there&#039;s meaningful perma-deaths that aren&#039;t ridiculously built up to?), but what I hope viewers will come away with is a valuable understanding of inter-relationship dynamics between rational, well developed characters.

    Tower of Druaga - the Sword of Uruk is the second season of the Tower of Druage series and continues where the first season ended.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story begins six months after their fight against Druaga and the betrayal of Neeba and Kaaya. If you could say that the story in the first season wasn&#039;t very innovative , the story in the second season is even worse. It&#039;s so predictable that from the beginnig I already knew what was going to happen . As you probably guess , Jill and the rest of his friends are going to try to get to the Mythical Tower and see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16950">
        what happened to Neeba and Kaaya . And to get there they&#039;ll need a help of a small girl called Kai , who looks like Kaaya, only in small &quot;format&quot; :D. Also , many things happened in the last six months. King Gilgamesh became more cruel and didn&#039;t reward the climbers for killing Druaga. Instead he took all the glory for himself. Jill&#039;s party borke up . Kelb quit the army. Etc. Together with the small girl , the survivals of Neeba and Jill&#039;s party  formed one party and started , again, their journey to the top of the tower , and in the same time , trying to escape from Uruk&#039;s army, led by Uragon and the new enemy party, lead by Gremica , a distant relative of Neeba. <br />
<br />
<br />
In this sequel , some of the supporting characters from the first season , such as Fatina and Utu gained more airing time , but also some new characters appeared , like Henaro (who will join their party) , but also some new enemies , like Gremica and Uragon. As the story goes , you will find out Kaaya&#039;s and Neeba&#039;s reason for betraying their comrades , but also the goal from the new character in their party , Henaro. <br />
Similar to the first season , the story will follow  their  journey (Jil&#039;s , Uragon, Neeba&#039;s and Gremica parties) to the top floor of the Mythical Tower . Unfortunately, there won&#039;t be many varieties of enemies , and it&#039;ll be focused on the fight between the parties and some other &quot;guests&quot; from the four boxes that Pazuz opened in the first season. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jil is still the naive kind of guy who believes everything he&#039;s told and he forgives everyone no matter what they have done to him. There is a well known saying : &quot;Fool me once,  shame on you , fool me twice , shame of me&quot;. In his case , he has been fooled and betrayed by almost everyone , so I really don&#039;t know whom should he blame :D . But what&#039;s even worse he always find some way to forgive them.....<br />
It&#039;s not related to the story , but I noticed that Kai has a very weird habit . She likes to stick the spoon in other people&#039;s butts (this is not a joke). Very weird . I guess it was meant to be fun , although I didn&#039;t found it fun at all .......<br />
The other members of Jil&#039;s party are more normal , and not so naive as Jil , but since their goal is already known , there won&#039;t be many flashbacks on their past. Instead it&#039;ll focus more on the present and their fights against the enemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The animation is the same as in the first season , in other way , average. The music themes are almost the same , so U might get a bit bored from  hearing the same melodies over and over again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally,  this anime deserves 7/10 . The main reason for that is that it was very predictable and from the beginning you knew what would happen . The other reason was the naivety of Jil , which really annoyed me . He got betrayed several times, but still he never learned anything from it , and got betrayed again and again. And what&#039;s worse , he easily forgave the people that betrayed him. Also , the fight&#039;s weren&#039;t so interesting as the ones in the first season .  Although it has many flaws and it&#039;s predictable  , you won&#039;t get bored by watching it . Especially if you like this kind of genre .

    Sorry, I will be blunt and its not gonna be incredibly detailed and written like an essay for a written lit course.<br />
<br />
The story sucks.  It has its moments, but it&#039;s not the greatest.  My honest opinion is that the story is rather simplistic and it doesn&#039;t really hold up with its happy go lucky ending.  The characters feel really weak at times, and they don&#039;t exactly flesh them out to an extent where we want to care for them.  The music is decent if you mean the opening.  Only decent part of the anime was the opening.  The rest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271304">
        of the time, it felt like hell watching the anime. It was rather boring outside of the occasional joke and the main antagonist was just boring.  The main heroine? She needed to be slapped because she was the reason why this stuff happened.  The main character needed to learn more about self preservation and to stop dragging people to their death.  The side characters were interesting to a degree, but nothing too ground breaking.

    Am I the only one upset about the poor explanation in this anime? Why did the battle in the end have to occur? Why couldn&#039;t they have sided with the brother? At least, they killed off some people that should&#039;ve been killed instead of letting their poor excuse for a main character be friends with them. People try to kill the mc and then change their minds, and then he&#039;s like &quot;let&#039;s be friends.&quot; These types of main characters are very poor and stupid. I still enjoyed the anime for the most part though.<br />
<br />
Story: 8. I&#039;m a sucker for fantasy tower/dungeon stories.<br />
Art: 5. Not very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263247">
        good, but not horrible.<br />
Sound: 5. Average.<br />
Character: 3. Poor. Even the good guys were often rude and not someone you&#039;d want to cheer on. Silly reasons or no reason spurred their actions.<br />
Enjoyment: 7. This matters the most in my opinion.<br />
Overall: 7.

    Tower of druaga is one of the animes which i like most.its  a very good anime  to pass your time and enjoy but its not as great as FMAB or death note.its consists of two seasons :&#039;THE AEGIS OF URUK&#039; and &#039;THE SWOARD OF URUK&#039; which think makes this anime really interesting. &#039;&#039;&#039;STORY&#039;&#039;&#039; :i think this anime serios doesn&#039;t have a very good story rather it has such an unbelievable story which is full of twists.its totally unpredictable.you don&#039;t guess what will happen in the next episode.mainly 12 th episode of aegis of uruk was the worst.i was shocked to see its outcome.swoard

    The Sword Of Uruk is the second season of the Tower of Druaga anime, which continues the previous Aegis of Uruk.<br />
Story &amp; Characters: The story continues about half a year after the end of the first season, with everyone having gone their separate ways after Kaaya and Neeba&#039;s betrayel. Jil has become a drunk who just can&#039;t do anything, until one day the physical manifestation of the legendary priestess Ki comes and asks him to take her to the top of the now renamed &quot;Tower of Gilgamesh&quot; to help Neeba and Kaaya, and to save the kingdome by defeating king Gilgamesh&#039; shadow self, which is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296133">
        taking over the kings consciousness.  Jil and the others join forces again, with some troubles, and climbs the tower again, with a new ally called Henaro. The characters are mostly the same as the first season, except for a few, but are not as well done as in the first season, creating some confusion and flaws in the plot.<br />
Art &amp; sound: The artwork and sounds are mostly exactly like in the Aegis of Uruk.<br />
Overall: All in all an enjoyable watch, though it&#039;s slightly worse than the previous season. It&#039;s a fair show that you can give a go if you have time.<br />
Enjoy!

    For an anime based off an old video game, I&#039;d have to say this did very well.<br />
<br />
What drew me to this anime was the art!<br />
I love it. The character colors and designs are nice to look at.<br />
<br />
While this was a short series, it was very enjoyable. There was some outrageous humour, as seen in the booby trap episode-which was so bad in some of the hinted directions it went, but for someone who doesn&#039;t usually find dirty humour funny, I think I laughed a lot. My favourite in that episode was, however, the flat sprites.<br />
<br />
Aside the humour:<br />
<br />
YOu would not possibly have guessed, again, being it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35415">
        some risky anime based off an old video game...that it would have lots of depth.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of treachery and betrayal, as well as some much deeper human emotions that drive some of these characters. The motives you may not learn till the very last 5 minutes of the series, but they felt real to me (I tend to sink into character&#039;s a lot, so sometimes I take their viewpoints to understand them better).<br />
<br />
I loved the opening themes of both seasons as well, they are quite catchy and fun.<br />
<br />
I think some of the CG for the Druaga beast was a big awkward, maybe, but it made the monster feel more dramatic and &quot;There&quot;.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say this series was really great. It has a fair lot to surprise you with, given the original material, and became one of my favourite anime series within the first 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the star wars reference at the first episode as well...the goofy false episode that you shouldn&#039;t take seriously...I was very afraid how the story was going to go, but once the real story toke over, I was in :)<br />
<br />
Also, because I&#039;m not one who looks for flaws in any of my anime, I can&#039;t outright point out technical issues, because, the reason for watching is to ENJOY...so, go watch Druaga, and enjoy it!

    SPOILERS-FREE<br />
<br />
This is a sequel to the first Uruk Series.  If you watched that and wanted to get answers from the sequel, I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll be disappointed.  This show has the EXACT same flaws as the first.  Exactly the same.  <br />
<br />
I swear, half-finished sentences are the whole reason this show sucks,  It sets up these great mysteries, but then never solves them, even from the first show.  Who is the blue girl floating by Neeba?  How and why was the tower made?  Why didn&#039;t Kiya just EXPLAIN why she left with Neeba?  Never explained.  <br />
<br />
Great, GREAT

          <span style="display: none;" id="review235948">
        side characters who go NOWHERE, a main lead who is dumb as a brick, a story that starts out with promise and then answers NO questions, and a story propelled entirely by the needs of the plot, rather than the desires of the characters.  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s even a scene later on where the main character is asked for his reasoning: why is he risking his life and the lives of his companions?  His answer?  &quot;Do I need one?  It&#039;s who I am!&quot;.  Then his friends stare in typical anime awe. as if he just won the debate.  His entire goal is to find answers, but when he has them, he does nothing with them!  He keeps going, because we, the audience, know the top of the tower is where the climax will be.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;m sorry if you wanted a better conclusion to the story, but you won&#039;t find it here.  No ending scene either, it just ends.  We don&#039;t even know what happened to our lead.  Why is it so hard for people to wrap up these shows?

    In the 10th episode the MC literally declairs that he has no purpose or goal. <br />
Those who follow him hear this as an ultimate wisdom, and continue to follow him to a deathmarch. The MC doesn&#039;t care that he leads his friends into constant mortal danger for no purpose.<br />
This sums it up. <br />
<br />
Second season of a run-off-the-mill stereotypical ganbare-shounen fantasy. The characters are still one-trait, still act utterly, irritatingly stupid. Story is still forgettable, the world still lacks any detail. <br />
I was hoping that the MC&#039;s and side characters&#039; pesonality will develop after the first season, but sadly, they are still the same, but maybe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review402933">
        even worse in one aspect: in the first season they were all somewhat sceptical regarding the MC-s unreasonable &quot;ganbare&quot; mentality, because it can get everyone killed, and it&#039;s not about others. It&#039;s about the MC satisfying his dreams of heroism, without any responsibility for others. Now in the second season they accept and love it. <br />
The first season at least treats you with some comedy and false hope during the first two episodes. <br />
There are hundreads if not thoudands of similar fantasies out there, I recommend to choose one of those instead, because this is uspeakably dreadful.
