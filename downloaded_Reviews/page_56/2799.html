    This can only be described as konosuba’s love child. But the kind you know will be a complete abomination so you try and push whoever conceived such a thing down a flight of stairs or two or three.

It’s like having a coke addiction, but you’re all out of coke and well, it’s black

Most people might call this show an atrocity saying such illogical things as,” this main character is shallow af.” All I have to say to that is how dare you! If you’re someone who’s cultured, then you’d know not only is he an advocate of true gender equality, but he’s not afraid to let his lust leak from all orifices. You might not think that last part is too great a feat, but when it’s leakage is on par with my power plant down the street then you’d too would wish you didn’t have flippers. Makes writing reviews that god is making me do to atone for my sins of having trash taste quite difficult. Although they do make me feel like Michael Phelps dumpster diving for these kind of gems. <br />
<br />
I’ll just get this next part out of the way now. Something everyone has been wondering whether you knew you wanted to know or not. This man will never be as great as his father Kazuma. Having about as much luck as I do with gambling, he pushes what luck he doesn’t have further than my bank account into the red. So while he will never become as renown as his father kazutrash, Kazuma the Brute, Scumzuma, You should have comfort in knowing that he is gifted Kazuma’s advanced intellectual capabilities. In a world where his currency revolves around being evil to get evil points, you have to be Kazuma’s level or lower. Combat Agent 6’s degeneracy knows no bounds. <br />
<br />
Next we have Alice, the loli with a shotgun. Legal loli may I add! Age is just a number when you’re an android ;) have you ever wondered what it would be like to be traveling with a walking nuclear bomb? As someone who’s driven a Mitsubishi Mirage I know exactly how it is to be with a death trap. First you’re taking a turn, next thing you know you’re upside down riding in the bed of a truck missing 3 doors and the front of the car. Not to mention the airbag doesn’t deploy till 22 minutes later. The difference between Alice and my Mirage is that  one is dependable/works and the other is buried six feet under to never give another car a dent again. Rest In Peace Mirage. You lasted me a good 3ish weeks. Everybody needs a straight man and that’s exactly what six has with Siri I mean Alice. <br />
<br />
You know what’s better than Aqua though? Two Aquas! Although snow is basically the Antichrist to Aqua. Not because ones a “goddess” and the other is evil. But one is beyond useless and the other I’d go on a crusade with. I have a sneaking suspicion snow is really one of aquas otherworldly followers. Now hear me out. You know how Aqua would deliver a god blow the same way johnny cage does his famous nut punch to protect her alcohol? Snow loves her sword the same way Aqua loves alcohol. Often depicted sleeping with it the same way I do with my boku no pico dakimakura. <br />

Now I don’t play favorites because that’s a sin and I already have a 1 way deportation ticket to hell when I ascend, but Grimm is 100% best girl. Why you may ask? She’s a crippled Darkness with a dash of wiz. Maybe the other way around. Anyways, Example A why she’s best girl: She’s as useless in a fight as Darkness in just the right ways. Think of it like this. Darkness lands less blows with her sword than I do in Mortal Kombat and I might as well not play cause I get lucky to land one. But she makes up for it with her ROCK! HARD! adamantite armor not to be confused with her massive muscular body that puts body builders to shame. Grimm wields no sword, has a body as frail as glass bones and paper skin, but also has her redeeming factor. She’s a priestess! Unlike using the outdated mana system she chances any spell cast backfiring on her. Like possibly making herself a cripple because she wanted a couple to never be able to wear footwear again... so yes, she’s useless. Example B and the only other example you need. Wholesome Rule 34 of her and six.<br />
 <br />
And finally there’s Rose. The offbrand crimson demon clan member. Does the fear inducing introductory pose the same way as her non related ancestors did. She’s a battle chimera meaning it’s a sylvia that won’t poke you from behind. The superior version of Suneater from MHA. You know, the one in the big 3 nobody knows or cares to remember. Unlike her inferior she doesn’t need to carry around snacks to use the abilities of what she consumes. You know that saying you are what you eat? Well that’s taken to heart here. She eats a dragon, she becomes the dragon. More or less kinda sorta. She’s hawk from seven deadly sins in humanish form. <br />
<br />
As far as true plot goes, Its just an interstellar Konosuba. Agent six is quite literally the byproduct of Kazuma x Megumin. The perfect culmination of the twos best worst qualities. It’s the sequel that started way before the prequel.

    The wonderful thing about the Internet is the amount of freedom we have. And with freedom, we can use our creativity to build worlds, to imagine ourselves in places where we never expected, or meet people from the other side of the globe. What does that tell you about anime? Well, it means writers are able to freely express their thoughts and ideas into their work no matter how ludicrious it is. <br />
<br />
Take Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! for example. It&#039;s written by Natsume Akatsuki, the same writer who is the brainchild behind the KonoSuba franchise. You remember Konosuba, right? Unless you&#039;ve been living under a rock, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403454">
        series became a light novel and anime sensation back when it was airing. And now, he&#039;s back. Mr Akatsuki decided to translate his ideas into this show because freedom allows him to do what and how he wants. Isn&#039;t freedom just wonderful?<br />
<br />
To be fair, Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is a completely seperate show and doesn&#039;t have any direct connection with Konosuba. So yes, go ahead and watch this without any knowledge would be a fairly straightforward easy thing to do. However, that doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t feel a similar experience when watching this goofball of a show. If you&#039;ve ever felt the need to turn your brains off, then feel free to jump right in. But I should warn you, this anime loves comedy and the author wants you to laugh every square inch of the way. <br />
<br />
As the first episode progressed, we quickly find out just how goofy the main cast is. Let&#039;s start with Combat Agent Six, the man with the perverted mind who wants to do lewd acts to his bosses, from the organization Kisaragi. Yeah, you heard me right. Six explifies the type of protagonist who says what&#039;s on his mind and does what he wants, or even who he wants. Out of every character in the show, we see him perform the most lewd acts and because it&#039;s part of his mission to collect &quot;Evil Points&quot;. I don&#039;t know how high the author was when he created Six but let&#039;s just say that he is about as obnoxious as a protagonist can get. Joining him as a group of female characters including Alice, Snow, Rose, Grimm, and his superiors. The majority of the show follows Six&#039;s group to collect evil points and and completing missions. No, it&#039;s not an RPG because Six himself isn&#039;t into roleplaying. He only seems to care about himself at first but he does get the job done when the time calls for it. Surprisingly, Six is actually efficient with some of his clever yet underhanded tactics. In various episodes, he behaves like a fool but can also be a badass when he wants. I don&#039;t mean type of badass that will make his look enemies weak. What I mean is that Six can be very efficient with his combat skills and it&#039;s why Kisaragi decided to employ him as an agent on their assignments.<br />
<br />
Six doesn&#039;t carry this anime all on his shoulders. We can&#039;t ignore the pretty android Alice, can we? Out of all the main cast in this show, she is perhaps the most normal and that&#039;s saying a lot when you realize she isn&#039;t even human. Unlike Six, she demonstrates a serious attitude on her assignments and often berates him for his foolish behavior. Their first meeting in the show starts out rocky but over time seems to get along well enough to get jobs done. Then, there&#039;s Snow, the woman with the haughty attitude and executive officer serving under Six. Their relationship in the show is comically toxic. By toxic, I don&#039;t just mean it as drama, insults, and names thrown at each other. What I mean is that Snow has to deal with Six for he is if she wants to remain in her position. And as fate turns out, she does warm up to Six and the others as time drags on. That doesn&#039;t refrain Six from talking lewd words to her though. Outside of these three, there&#039;s also Grimm, the flirtious redhead in the wheelchair. And despite being flirty, she becomes embarassed when lewd acts are performed on her. Many episodes shows that she is a pure hearted girl inside but acts like the opposite outside. And last but not least, there&#039;s Rose, a mascot of their group with a massive appetite. It seems when the author created her, they wanted a main character to fill the void of a gluttonious girl. When you package these characters together, you get perhaps the most idiotic group of 2021.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s not get too ahead of ourselves though. Outside of Six&#039;s group, we also need to know about Kisaragi and their goal. What is Kisaragi? The easiest way to say it is that they are an evil organization. Sure, they are &quot;evil&quot; but to emphasize, the show doesn&#039;t protray them as malicious as they sound. In fact, Kisaragi has moral obligations and I dare say that their members aren&#039;t evil at all. Freezing Astaroth and Flaming Belial are two members who tasked Six to collect &quot;Evil Points&quot; but the way they protrayed their assignments almost seems like a parody. Evil Points is collected by evil deeds but the anime subverts and downplays as a joke. That is also thanks to Six&#039;s actions such as trying to gain evil points by lifting Grimm&#039;s skirt. Regardless, I think once you&#039;ve seen the first few episodes, you&#039;ll realize the anime isn&#039;t bound on showing how &quot;evil&quot; Kisaragi is at all.<br />
<br />
Tagged with some of the familiar genres you&#039;d expect from the Konosuba author, the anime itself loves its running jokes. There&#039;s countless recurring gags such as Snow&#039;s money fetish, Six&#039;s perverted way of living life, or Grimm being the target of sexual harassment. Sexual references and allusions is also common thanks to words being misunderstood. For instance, a conversation between Six and Grimm once gave him the impression of sex when she actually wants to eat him. There&#039;s also dick jokes thrown around by Six&#039;s perverted mind to the princess Tillis. It seems at every opportunity, this show will make fun of itself in some shape or form, usually the perverted way.<br />
<br />
Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is the type of anime that you can recommend to your friend but I&#039;d be careful if they&#039;ve never seen something similar like this before. They might get the wrong impression or message of what the author wanted them to see. But if you&#039;re watching this show on your own, let&#039;s just say that turning your brain off is an understatement. In fact, turn all common sense off because this anime has transcended beyond the realm of normalcy. This is far from a normal show and the author wanted you to be free to experience their work. Isn&#039;t being able to express your thoughts like this so freely just wonderful?

    Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is basically a retelling of KonoSuba—only much, much inferior. That&#039;s not to say that it&#039;s particularly a bad anime, but does that matter much when pretty much the entire time I was thinking: &quot;I wish I was watching KonoSuba instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea of parodying isekai RPGs was novel few years ago. However, after the release of countless light novels and anime that have parodied/attempted to parody isekai, this concept has become painfully dull as practically everything about the genre has already been covered. Originally a light novel by Natsume Akatsuki—the creator of KonoSuba—Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is essentially just another unremarkable isekai parody. I know what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403451">
        most of you are probably thinking. Given the fact that the original light novel is written by Akatsuki, we should be expecting another side-splitting comedy anime, but in reality, Sentouin only dreams to be as funny as KonoSuba.<br />
<br />
KonoSuba was one of the first, if not the first, anime to parody the then ubiquitous isekai genre, which is why it had become so popular. However, no matter how distinctive the set-up was, what primarily made KonoSuba so enjoyable were its flawed yet incredibly hilarious characters. The comedy of Sentouin is dependent on its characters as well, but the difference is that most of the characters aren&#039;t nearly as likeable and entertaining; they are more or less the watered-down versions of KonoSuba characters.<br />
<br />
Sentouin&#039;s comedy is mostly hit-or-miss. Most of the jokes involve sexual matters in one way or another, which I don&#039;t really find funny. I won&#039;t pretend that I&#039;m a &quot;mature&quot; guy who doesn&#039;t laugh at lewd jokes—because I&#039;m not. Gintama is one of my favorite anime of all time and it contains a fair amount of sexual humor as well, but that&#039;s far from what essentializes the series (the same could be said about KonoSuba). In contrast, one of Sentouin&#039;s essential parts IS the lewd comedy; taking out the lewd jokes would be like removing one half of the entire show. To make it worse, the hackneyed lewd humor crosses the line multiple times in Sentouin, which includes the protagonist Agent Six shamelessly groping the female characters, pulling down their panties, forcing them to do lewd things, etc.<br />
<br />
This also brings up the topic of using repulsive fanservice as a means of &quot;comedy&quot;.<br />
<br />
KonoSuba isn&#039;t entirely immune to this either, but the issue of fanservice is far, far more prevalent in Sentouin. There are several distasteful panty and cleavage shots in the show that serve no purpose besides appeasing the horny fanbase. This doesn&#039;t mean I can&#039;t stand &quot;meaningless&quot; fanservice at all. I&#039;m a fairly big fan of the To LOVE-Ru franchise (Darkness, specifically) which is full of pointless and over-the-top ecchi scenes. However, when most of the fanservice is followed by a creepy guy making crude and despicable jokes about it, I think it&#039;s reasonable to display some concern.<br />
<br />
A lot of people seem to liken Agent Six to Kazuma, but these two aren&#039;t nearly the same. Despite his perverted tendencies, Kazuma is surprisingly a very well-written character. Unlike most of his peers who are protected by the mythical object known only as &quot;plot armor&quot;, he actually uses his brain to solve his problems. Deceptively clever and knowledgeable, Kazuma is the main (or perhaps the only) reason why his practically dysfunctional group manages to do something useful sometimes. His witty remarks, sneaky tactics and ingenious schemes are one of the prime aspects that make KonoSuba so entertaining.<br />
<br />
On the other hand of the spectrum, Six&#039;s essential character trait is the fact that he is a giant creep. He is pretty much Kazuma—if Kazuma was made thousand times more stupid and creepy. In the anime, Agent Six himself doesn&#039;t do anything useful for the most part (it&#039;s usually Alice who does the actual work), and instead causes trouble for others on a regular basis. Most of his jokes aren&#039;t even remotely funny. Rather, his creepy and idiotic behavior only makes you annoyed and uncomfortable. Despite that, like every harem protagonist, all the girls surrounding him seem to find him charming for some reason.<br />
<br />
Fans of Sentouin will probably say Six does these awful things only so that he could gain evil points, but that&#039;s a complete lie. Pretty much all of the times, Six actually enjoys the detestable stuff that he does. Although there are a couple of occasions where he becomes remorseful for his actions, they are few and far between. And even if I disregard that argument, integrating evil points into the story is still just a convenient plot device to include fanservice as much as possible; it has no other purpose besides that and doesn&#039;t rationalize the sexual harassment.<br />
<br />
Luckily, not everything about Six is irredeemable. There are times when he can actually be a nice person. Take a scene from episode 7 for example, where he found Mokemoke to be adorable and genuinely wanted to be friends with it—tell me that wasn&#039;t heartwarming! (although the ending is morbid) Moments like this are one of Six&#039;s few saving graces and probably one of the best parts of the entire show. Unfortunately, when you take his countless loathsome acts into consideration, you realize that Six ultimately doesn&#039;t amount to much more than a scumbag. And no, being self-aware about it doesn&#039;t help.<br />
<br />
Most of the other significant characters—all of them are females btw—primarily exist for being the unfortunate victims of fanservice and Six&#039;s sexual harassment. They aren&#039;t as unlikeable as Six to be fair, but that isn&#039;t really saying much. Similarly to KonoSuba, pretty much the entire cast of Sentouin is extremely flawed, but whereas the former uses the imperfections of its characters to make them more endearing, in the latter it mostly makes them annoying. Alice is probably the most likeable of all the characters; her clever and deadpan personality is a nice change of pace from the usual idiocy.<br />
<br />
In terms of narrative, it wouldn&#039;t be too far-off to say that there&#039;s absolutely nothing remarkable about Sentouin. It blatantly rehashes the fundamental tropes of most isekai parodies and doesn&#039;t bother to add much of its own flavor. The obvious lack of originality makes the show kinda tiring to watch at times, especially when you consider the fact that there are already a multitude of anime that are based on the same basic concept and follow the same story patterns. Another apparent flaw regarding the storyline, and possibly where Sentouin falters the most, is how the show handles its serious side of things.<br />
<br />
Despite mainly being a comedy anime, Sentouin does contain a reasonable amount of drama, and I honestly wouldn&#039;t have any issues with it—if it wasn&#039;t this poorly written. There is an overarching plot in Sentouin that revolves around the conflict between humans and demons, and it&#039;s all hastily put together and doesn&#039;t mesh well with the comedy. I get it, the plot is only supposed to be a side-dish here, not the entire thing. But if you think putting in the right amount of ingredients is too much of a hassle, why did you bother to give me the side-dish to begin with?<br />
<br />
During dramatic scenes, the characters suddenly become attached to each other for the sake of plot progression. When something serious is about to happen, they suddenly act like they have always been best friends. But here&#039;s the problem—they never had any proper bond in the first place. The anime does pretty much nothing to flesh out its characters in a meaningful way, so dramatic scenes like this can only be seen as awkward and pointless. I mean, tell me how I&#039;m supposed to think those guys are being serious when one of them literally pulled down a girl&#039;s panties few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Amidst all this chaos and stupidity, Sentouin does have a few morsels to offer. One of the plus points of the show is that it&#039;s at least aware of its own inanity, and while that&#039;s not necessarily always a good thing, I can still appreciate the honesty (as odd as that sounds). There&#039;s something quite exasperating about watching a show that is being ostentatious with its comedy, and Sentouin fortunately isn&#039;t guity in that regard. Of course, self-awareness can only carry a show so far, but at the very least, it made Sentouin a tolerable experience.<br />
<br />
The comedy doesn&#039;t always disappoint. Akatsuki has proved in KonoSuba that he is a talented author, and his brilliance occasionally shines in Sentouin as well. Character dynamic is one of the key things to consider when you are making an anime (especially if it&#039;s a genre like comedy that primarily relies on characters), and while the characters of Sentouin generally share a rather feeble bond, their dynamic during comedy scenes is surprisingly quite strong. Unexpectedly, there are some well thought-out jokes here and there that don&#039;t shamelessly resort to fanservice, and utilitize the characters&#039; dynamic instead for which they are actually clever and funny.<br />
<br />
Remember that I said the characters are annoying? Well, that&#039;s not always true. Like Agent Six, all of them have their own great moments. There are occasional moments in the anime when their charm shines through; especially when they are together, they are able to complement each other pretty well. Because of their strong dynamic, sometimes it&#039;s quite entertaining to watch the characters simply goof around. From time to time, they can be reminiscent of KonoSuba&#039;s quartet reflecting the latter&#039;s usual charisma and excellent compatibility, which should be a plus point for KonoSuba fans like me.<br />
<br />
The animation of Sentouin is actually pretty good, although nothing particularly remarkable or worth taking notice of. The character designs are obviously designed to be attractive, and attractive they are. If you simply want some cute girls to gawk at, Sentouin should be able to meet your expectations quite easily. On a side note, the costumes of the characters are fairly varied and distinct—I have to give the artist a pat on the back for that. The background designs aren&#039;t half-bad, either.<br />
<br />
Like most light novel adaptations, the soundtrack of Sentouin mainly consists of generic upbeat tracks. That doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s bad though; it actually works well with the lively nature of the anime. The dramatic scenes, however, tend to be rather unengaging since they are mostly accompanied with trite and overly sentimental music. The opening &quot;No. 6&quot; is a pretty generic J-pop song that has some annoying parts, but it does suit the vibrant style of the anime. The ending song &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; is quite catchy and has a soothing vibe to it, which I personally find very charming (Alice&#039;s voice is amazing).<br />
<br />
Sentouin isn&#039;t entirely meritless. Although I have been fairly critical about the show in this review, I have also said that I did enjoy it. Sure, the comedy is mostly trite and inane, but I have to admit that it still made me laugh sometimes. Sure, the characters are generic and can be pretty annoying, but I have to admit that they still kept me somewhat entertained. For what it&#039;s worth, Sentouin can be quite enjoyable despite all its flaws, so I found it a bit difficult to actually dislike the show.<br />
<br />
But then again, I would have had a much better time watching KonoSuba instead.

    I will be honest. Its not a really good anime when you have a tight time like me who is trying to land a job. I guess  its good. not very or amazingly, just good. You would rate this 10/10 if you hadnt seen konosuba, or you laugh on daddy jokes.<br />
<br />
Story : If we remove the comedy, the story is like 3? or 4. Lets be real. This is the same with konosuba. I guess, thats why they are investing in comedy. Its a great anime especially after watching some depressing shit. Like I read the murder case of Junko F. , if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394942">
        havent read, you should just get a short summary of it as I would not recommend children reading that. Thats alot of off topic, anyways, the story kept on a plot which is very unstable. Though the future, atleast from the manga looks promising.<br />
<br />
Art : The art seems not lacking atleast. I have not focused on it, though even after watching it, I saw no issues with it. Its not amazing but it has its place on good.<br />
<br />
Sound : OP, love it. The sounds are also not lacking anywhere and the OP really matches the comedy style. It has that vibe in it. <br />
<br />
Character : <br />
Agent 6/ MC : We are at episode 4 only so expecting too much will not be good. Though the manga shows a good future, atleast, which means that this rating will stay unchanged.<br />
Alice : Her development sure looks like waifu 1. And I aint complaining about it. These are atleast no flaws that I have found yet which is promising.<br />
Snow and other characters : They are what essentially create the story. The development is amazing. To put it in simple terms, they are not lacking anything, yet they have something which makes all of them unique.<br />
Side Characters : Its comedy and from the author of konosuba. Dont expect development here. Though atleast they have given considerations to avoid plotholes which is good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : The comedy easily brings a smile on my face. The first time I watched konosuba, my parents thought that I was a maniac who replaced their child. Laughing in the toilet, car and everywhere you can name. With that much laughing, I have gotten alot of immunity to this shit. So I would say that this would atleast make the veterans smile while the newbies gotta have some extra oxygen tanks at the ready.<br />
<br />
TL;DR : A good comedy. Though it does not have alot of potential to get a sequel from a viewers perspective cuz the plot is as unstable as my heart in front of girls

    Sentouin is crude, low brow, and juvenile as all hell. And yet I laugh every single time. Not every show has to be meaningful or high brow, but I&#039;m glad shows like these can exist alongside and contrast against other elitist pretentious crap. You know you&#039;ve got a gem of a show when even the episode previews are entertaining. <br />
<br />
Like seriously, there&#039;s an entire episode that&#039;s basically a 20 minute long episode preview and it&#039;s still funny as hell. <br />
<br />
Sentouin hits you with jokes like a machine gun. The jokes come fast and even if one doesn&#039;t hit, another one soon takes its place. Even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403467">
        with the less than stellar presentation (JC Staff really shouldn&#039;t take on multiple shows per season), the fact that this show can still stand as one of the best of the season speaks volumes to its quality in writing, crude as it may be. <br />
<br />
I love the characters in this so much. Everyone&#039;s a complete asshole in this (apart from Heine, maybe Astaroth), and I love the tokusatsu-isekai hybrid they have. It&#039;s very fresh compared to the gamut of isekai out there in the market and the over-the-top nature of the tokusatsu world No.6 hails from just complements the isekai-ish world he ends up in. Sure the MCs (apart from Alice) do hesitate doing actually evil stuff, but in the moment when you&#039;re watching each episode, you wouldn&#039;t mind the hesitation so much.<br />
<br />
Also I must note this show contains quite possibly my favourite fake-out confession across any anime. It&#039;s a testament to how strongly written and likable (or like-to-hate-ness) of the characters.<br />
<br />
You really couldn&#039;t ask for more. Sentouin has been a real blast to sit through and I always wonder there&#039;s another wacky dumb comedy out there somewhere to fill the hole in my heart.<br />
<br />
8/10

    THIS ANIME IS MADE BY THE SAME AUTHOR AS THAT OF KONOSUBA<br />
<br />
and I totally felt that the entirety of the first episode was an excuse to include as many konosuba references as possible to promote the work!<br />
<br />
which is why I keep comparing this to konosuba because although it was supposed to be a different experience with a similar taste it feels like an ADVERTISEMENT OF KONOSUBA FOR THE FIRST TWO EPISODES.<br />
<br />
but the third episode is like the redemption arc for this anime where you can feel an actual story and world being presented to you at last XD<br />
<br />
now then,<br />
<br />
<br />
SHOULD YOU WATCH IT:-<br />
SHORT ANSWER YES IF

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394230">
        YOU GIVE IT THE THREE EPISODE RULE LIKE I DID YOU WILL SEE IT STARTS TO STICK for me it was around episode 3 that I noticed that show is actually pretty good<br />
<br />
1) good comedy even though a lot of oppai jokes<br />
2) original story and I like where it is going it feels like it&#039;ll be a story where earth squad teaches the kingdom to be efficient and the non earth will help them become good human beings I don&#039;t hate that dynamic<br />
3)tactical warfare which is logical and prioritizes victory over chivalry this is particularly funny since the medieval people know only how to fight chivilarously xD<br />
<br />
<br />
not convinced yet ? then ,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if you have been struggling to decide if you want to see konosuba give this one a shot<br />
<br />
anime tiddies connesieur? absolute win!<br />
<br />
Comedy kinda guy ? maybe after all episodes are released since there is a chance it may go the cautious hero route<br />
<br />
veteran weeb with 200+ anime? you will watch it because you know 7/10 is probably the best we get aside from the heavy hitters this which will want to binge-watch later anyway so this will keep you occupied<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY:-<br />
all I can say at this point t of the story is:-<br />
overused boob jokes I guess that is cause they realize that anime tiddies is the safest fanservice method in any gag manga they went with it<br />
<br />
there is foreshadowing in the second and a little part of the third episode that this anime may take the cautious hero route since unlike kazutrash this MC seems to actually have a sense of camaraderie. and he cares about his teammates this could potentially ruin the original gag manga setting and vibes that it gives off however some people may dig it.<br />
<br />
then came episode 3 where the story starts looking stronger the characters feel more realistic the gag tag is removed and you actually come to love at least one of them if not all , you can tell that the earth squad is actually prioritizing a lesser degree of loss over righteousness and seem to be more cold and calculative and I guess I will love to see what kind of change will be bought to them with their time with the non-earth people.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART:-<br />
The art is the typical adventure anime type no use of CGI as of yet facial animation is top-notch as was in konosuba although ironically even though this show has way more BOOB jokes it does not have the BOOB PHYSICS of KONOSUBA the story starts to form a little more from episode 3 and you see lesser gag faces but most people will not mind that<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND:-<br />
the voice acting in konosuba is one of the prime reasons it as famous as it was and the voice acting in this though still above average is not on the same level as kazutrash and hence doesn&#039;t have the same allure.<br />
<br />
THE OP is an instant banger for me the ED is sort of ok<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:-<br />
the usual ara ara onee san who is bold and attacks MC with ERO in the second episode<br />
barely LEGAL loli since it s a robot with the cold attitude<br />
classic tsundere knight with dekai oppai who is actually the I guess moral compass of the group<br />
the glutton seems to have a more original personality till now.<br />
<br />
three out of the five are likable for me as of yet<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
overall verdict after three episodes a solid 7 out of 10 DID not seem to have a good start but looks like it is gonna git gud from here<br />

    Combatans will be dispatsched, the english title of the anime is an anime that exist. Did it have to exist? Not really, it is just a piece of work that I have so many problems with and its even worse after I knew who the author was. So lets give a small introduction to this Anime, it is an Isekai comendy show with a cast of a loli, a pervert, stupid and fan-service. Does that sound familiar, yeah its kinda the same as Konosuba but way worse in every aspect. And the worst part is is because its the same guy who made konosuba also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403503">
        made this, piece of shit &quot;work&quot;. The thing what angers me the most isn&#039;t that he is going to make an other comendy anime but rather again using the Isekai setting, this not only limits his jokes and you know what happens than but he could have used so much other genres instead of Isekai, but nope, an other Isekai anime comendy. And he also didn&#039;t fix his problems that Konosuba had and you know what those problems were, so lets talk about the comendy of this show and man its bad.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Comendy in general is a very subjective genre from itself. Some people see comendy like,&quot;If its funny, its good&quot;. And thats the thing, some people laugh at the jokes of female comedians and other don&#039;t, becuase that is how were made. We are different from eachother but we cant deny when a joke is good or not. None of the jokes in this show are good. Its mostly  cringey anime references or a character doing something stupid and other characters making comments about it. The thing is, I didnt laugh once in this entire show. And to be fair I also never laughed while watching Konosuba but at least I was enjoying the anime, this anime I am not enjoying because the jokes are so bad and so boring that I just cant enjoy it. The other thing is is because this work is made by the same author doesnt mean it has the same quality, Konosuba can act like this is a good anime but please tell me, is it because of the person who created it. Now lets talk about the last part of the comendy and No....why this shit. Look, this is why I mostly like 3d&gt;2d because of, the fan-service. &quot;●FANSERVICE ISNT COMENDY YOU MORRON●&quot;. So, grabbing boobs is considerd funny in our sociaty. I just dont understand, why has the fan-service been doubled since Konosuba. This is insane to the point where you can make this show a hentai and I wouldnt even care. What a huge f--king dissapointment, he still hasnt learnt his mistakes. Its just sad but <br />
&quot;tell me why&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life is nothing but a mistake&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, lets talk about characters&quot;<br />
<br />
Every single character in this show is just Konosuba characters but just way worse in like so many different ways. The charm is gone and the chemistry between the characters doesnt even work. They are just bland, unfunny. Not intressting and so many other problems. The author tried to recreate the characters from konosuuba but failed miserbaly. Its just not fun to watch characters talk and make bad jokes, its just f--king annoying. The characters aren&#039;t in anyway memorable or fun as I have already said, but hey, he at leas tried so thats good. But yeah It turned out terible. This is the reason why the setting shouldnt have been an isekai maybe something like a highschool or something but nope, just Isekai. *Sigh*.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Just really average, so not a lot to complain about.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Both the op and ending werent very catchy but the visuals were good so thats good right.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Well, I didnt enjoy this show, the extremely bad jokes and shitty references really just ruined my experience for this show. I had low expetations but now they are even lower for next season. If comendy anime is going to turn out like this in the future then I will be dissapointed...<br />

    Natsume Akatsuki. This name should be very familiar to the big crowd of cultured people who watched KonoSuba before, not adding that his later work (Hataage! Kemono Michi) is hideously average at best. But what else is this author hiding? This show! And it&#039;s none other than Re:Zero author Tappei Nagatsuki whom found out that Natsume Akatsuki was actually hiding this work from superiors at Kadokawa, and if you know anything about the AniManga industry, if your work is noticed, you&#039;re gonna get rekted the hell outta deadlines and such. That&#039;s why he hid it from Kadokawa, and the snitch was just waiting to happen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403452">
        in time to come. So in regards to the original source material (and this anime), you can thank the &quot;Return by Death&quot; God that is Tappei Nagatsuki for revealing this well-hidden work to the world. Also, same industry friends be snitches LOL.<br />
<br />
Despite being released later than KonoSuba, it was actually Natsume Akatsuki&#039;s very first work with the whole &quot;another world&quot; ancient, sci-fi, interstellar joke of a setting with plain stupid and idiotic characters, most of which bear a lot of resemblance to KonoSuba (that the latter series refined on it and was a smashing hit). If you still don&#039;t get the gist of this show, like said series, it&#039;s meant to be literal jokes one after another without discourse and contentment. We all know the feeling of watching KonoSuba for the nth time, but to experience other works that may or may not have the same standard as the illusive frenetic comedy series, it&#039;s just comparing those to a very high pedestal. Seriously though, in Natsume Akatsuki&#039;s case, there is nothing that could top KonoSuba, though what was done here in &quot;Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!&quot; (a.k.a Combatants Will Be Dispatched!) definitely laid the groundwork into the creation of one of the most famous and iconic ironically cultured shows of the modern anime era. The former is the daily homework, while the latter is the BIG project.<br />
<br />
Helping the fact that it&#039;s not just an Isekai, but a &quot;transported into another world&quot; through object means (as opposed to being Truck-kun-ed,  stabbed or slept to death) that makes this show stand out amongst it&#039;s own hilariously self-aware, no pun intended, dirty comedy of the most degenerate kind. The characters know what is going on, and they&#039;re unafraid to bash the conventional terms of their existence in a shitty setting of a Black Company, one who only does &quot;pure&quot; devilish evil things. The MC in question is Kisaragi Corporation&#039;s Combat Agent No. 6, whom like Kazuma in action (plus a lil&#039; bit of Megumin with that &quot;Explosion!&quot; move), thinks that he is on top of the world with his evil skills as a combatant, and goes around like the bad influencer that the self-proclaimed agent is the &quot;best of the best&quot;. This show may not have Kazuma&#039;s refined &quot;true gender equality&quot; catchphrase, but what it does here is to add characters that provide that nonsensical jester and banter so &quot;evil&quot;, you might wanna squinch your eyes and gouge out those eyeballs if shit goes insane. For a mission that requires him to transport into another world to solve the case of a kingdom that is about to fall to the generalist ways of the Demon Lord, No. 6 is accompanied by a travelling companion: the no-nonsense, monotone, disfiguratively straightforward and exceptional android Alice. She can take all kinds of shit that No. 6 dishes out of his actions and his dirty-ass cuss mouth, and lead him into victory, all while being a vessel of the collection of &quot;Evil Points&quot;: deeds that range in the pervy kind, no matter how tangible it is, in exchange for useful parts transmitted from Earth when they are in a pinchy-punch. She&#039;s the equivalent of Doraemon in their world, and an extremely useful android at that too.<br />
<br />
Once transported into another world, more hijinks arise in the form of an ineloquent rag-tag team of an unintended &quot;harem&quot;: the boobs-heavy Snow, whose serious-but-cheap personalities emits a split personality according to her circumstances, all she ever cared for is fame, recognition, and the greed of money. In total, she&#039;s akin to Aqua in a lot of ways. Rose the chimera, a kid-like warrior that often attaches herself to No. 6, though not close to Megumin-like, but there&#039;s a cinch of that personality likeness. The Dark Witch Grimm, she&#039;s the easiest of the trio to compare to the KonoSuba crew as this series&#039;s version of Darkness, she has no shame and does what she wants on her own whim. Add in the endless sexual innuendo of &quot;tits&quot;-ular characters of what you would expect to find in ancient kingdoms of royalty, evil Demon Lord levels, and even some bootylicious &quot;evil&quot; managers of the Kisaragi Corporation, and you have the foundations of an imperfect KonoSuba in the making.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to keep stating that J.C.Staff&#039;s quality is whatever, but it&#039;s clear that this was made as a half-witted show, and director Hiroaki Akagi knows it best. Working 2 shows this season with this show and Mashiro no Oto for the Shin-Ei Animation in-house director, more than his directorial duties being stretched, with the limited resources, I&#039;m sure that the production team tried their best to deliver on the &quot;meh&quot; plot that incites a lot of forced comedy, even though it feels a lot on the crass side. But make no mistake, this show is indeed watchable, that&#039;s if you can handle the cringe for majority of the show.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d swear that Seiyuu Miku Itou&#039;s biography is getting a whole lot more with just more than notable characters like Gotoubun no Hanayome&#039;s Miku Nakano. Even down to her discography, the songs written by her are also getting better, as is the case for this show&#039;s OP, dressed in a comical-like fashion. While character-centralized collab songs are getting old pretty fast (with the case of the ED), I guess you could call that an art that was once prominent, and in this day and age, it&#039;s not all that viable anymore.<br />
<br />
All in all, unless you&#039;re looking for more KonoSuba, this show ain&#039;t worth your time to be looked at. Rather, I implore you to see from a different angle, that if not for &quot;Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!&quot;, we wouldn&#039;t even have KonoSuba in the very first place. Someone mentioned that &quot;It’s the sequel that started way before the prequel&quot;, and this is very true. In conclusion, of the 3 adaptations seen from Natsume Akatsuki, the latest (that is Kemono Michi) is a big departure, while both this series and KonoSuba are IMO considered to be in the same family tree. This show is not for everyone, and it may look and sound disgusting, but it is disgustingly good if you are willing to turn your brain off and enjoy this mindless and senselessly drought of a substandard work-in-progress.

    This show is written by the game guy who made Konusuba, so if you like Konosuba i reccomed you rewatch konosuba instead, because this show is not worth it at all. It is inferior in every single way you can think of.<br />
<br />
The story is about a &quot;Evil company&quot; and a &quot;Evil hero&quot;. The reason i wrote Evil Hero and not Anti-Hero is because he is not a anti-hero at all. He is just a cruel and mean hero, who does bad things because the author made me do it to &quot;compensate&quot; for when he does good deeds that the story needs to progress. It ridiculous.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403473">
        <br />
<br />
The show has &quot;comedic relief&quot; at the most inappropriate places. The demon army will wipe out all the humans of the city if the battle is lost? Time to make lame jokes like it&#039;s a normal day with no stakes at all! The music shifts to clownish comedy music in the middle of tense moments for some bizzare reason, Why? To make it fun? It certainly is not funny, it just comes off like the guy who wrote the story had no idea what he was doing and thought that adding in &quot;comedy&quot; randomly into a moment would somehow make it good.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the characters are flat and most are unlikable. The main Character is  a grown up warrior version of Kazuma, but without any of the positive aspects so he is just a perverted trash heap. Most other characters have serious flaws that don&#039;t make you attached to them at all.<br />
<br />
In the end when i think of what a failure this anime is, I wonder &quot;how the hell did he manage to make Konosuba a success?&quot; Was it just pure luck that Konosuba was good and not like this? I don&#039;t have any hopes that this author will manage to do better in his career.<br />
<br />
If you like a good Comedy/Isekai, pick anything else.

    Overall: It&#039;s an anime focused on comedy, which does not deepen the development of the characters. It has an ugly and poorly done scenario.<br />
<br />
Story: Unlike more than 99% of the anime I&#039;ve seen, this anime isn&#039;t really focused on a story in itself. It&#039;s extremely generic and focused on a funny narrative with comic relief all the time. It&#039;s the kind of anime that if I skipped an episode, it wouldn&#039;t make any difference because nothing important happens. Some things are simply not explained, which caused me great discomfort when watching. Some animes are made with a basic story and the author&#039;s goal is to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394549">
        make the viewer enjoy the adventure of the characters themselves, and not the reason why they are fighting. But in this anime it just doesn&#039;t happen, in the beginning the anime pushes you into a totally confused and meaningless story, which is not properly explained and leaves the viewer totally disoriented.<br />
<br />
Art: The animation itself is not bad, but it is far from being a good thing. While watching, I felt very uncomfortable with the colors of the anime; the terrain is orange and extremely simple, although the anime really takes place on another planet, for me it is not a reason to make such an ugly scenario.<br />
<br />
Sound: Extremely basic and the soundtrack is not good. Actually it&#039;s the best thing in this anime.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are extremely superficial and without any history. The girls only exist to increase the number of people in the protagonist&#039;s harem. The problem with the characters is so serious that if someone asks me to say 4 characteristics of each character, I would not be able to answer even half.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The anime makes references to other anime, but in my opinion it is something extremely weak and boring. Even though the anime focused on comedy, I confess that I couldn&#039;t find it funny most of the time, some scenes are so exaggerated that they just look strange instead of being funny.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: The anime is still in the middle, but so far it has been something horrible. I believe it can improve in the second half, but I think it is extremely unlikely that this will happen. I do not recommend this anime to anyone, it is an anime where everything is bad and the comedy that would be the strength of the anime, is not something so. If any changes happen, I will probably do another review.<br />
<br />

    it might be unfair to compare this to konosuba but i think enough people picked this up because this has the same author as konosuba<br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
has its funny moments but ultimately falls on its face because it rushes everything<br />
<br />
story: 5.5<br />
mediocre, rushed, unoriginal, unnecessarily convoluted, the opposite of a breath of fresh air like konosuba, doesn&#039;t know when to switch between serious and comedic<br />
<br />
art: 5.4<br />
generic isekai character design. probably the most original thing in this whole anime is the wheelchair character<br />
<br />
sound: 5<br />
meh. Voice actors are fine, not the dream cast of konosuba tho.<br />
<br />
character: 6<br />
tries to be original but all it really did was mash two genres together

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394373">
        and come off as really indecisive. <br />
<br />
enjoyment:6<br />
I would say i enjoyed this more than the average seasonal isekai adaptation but I&#039;m only really staying for the laughs

    As is with the majority of silly comedy anime you have to take Sentouin Hakenshimasu and this review with a grain of salt. It&#039;s one of those animes that are self aware and intentionally stupid. So if you are one of the people running around on this platform  who consider themself &quot;anime connoisseur&quot; and the &quot;sentiment of acquired taste&quot; please go and call out another anime for &quot;characters as flat as your girlfriend&#039;s chest&quot; or &quot;story as lame as Lightning Larry Luciano&quot; (damn a SpongeBob reference, a comparison and a hyperbole I&#039;m getting going on this one)<br />
<br />
Disclaimer out of the way so let&#039;s roll.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403505">
        <br />
<br />
<br />
If isekai is a family then Sentouin Hakenshimasu is that weird little cousin that always acts like he snorted uncle Kazumas cocaine line leftovers. <br />
I swear that&#039;s the only and last Konosuba reference or comparison (or is it).<br />
<br />
<br />
The story hits the zeitgeist like nothing else. <br />
It&#039;s basically Twitter as an anime. One stupid bubble bashes on another bubble on a quest to gather useless attention by harassing and insulting others while being as edgy as possible. Meanwhile, you enjoy the clash of idiotic morons and some occasional softcore porn while scrolling through your feed.<br />
Just the way you like it.<br />
<br />
You will find out that this description is more accurate than you might think so I don&#039;t even bother you with some actual introduction or summary. There&#039;s actually a linear plot that is featured here and there but overall it&#039;s still as deep as your bathtub. But that&#039;s fine, you wouldn&#039;t want your Twitter timeline to be covered in Kant or Nietzsche quotes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Coming to the main selling point: The cast. Anime like these need genuine and enjoyable characters. They need just the right traits and characteristics that fit the goofy and ironic narrative. And Sentouin Hakenshimasu ticks the necessary boxes. The main cast is a solid match of characters. They are really fun to watch and in no way boring or tediously dry.<br />
<br />
The main character is Combat agent Sex... I mean Six aka Zipperman. Hes your average degenrate twitter troll. And when he&#039;s not shitposting on some random Twitter hashtag or bullying someone on their discord server then he uses the rest of his spare unemployed day to moderate Reddit hentai fetish subs. What can I say his persona is just made to spread joy around his fellows. All jokes aside just for now but he&#039;s unironically a &quot;better&quot; character than you might suspect. Explaining that just wouldn&#039;t fit this review, trust me he has his moments.<br />
He&#039;s followed by his sidekick Alexa or was it Alice I don&#039;t remember. No, seriously that shotgun wielding Loli android is the epidemy of Amazon Alexa evolution. Just call her up and whatever goody you need she will ship it. High caliber weapons, C4 .. everything a modern household needs regularly. And when you don&#039;t keep her occupied by bombarding her with boomer joke requests, question her what to cook today or beg for life advice she will either interrupt you with a weather forecast for some town on the other side of the globe or remind you of those bugging appointments or chores you desperately try to avoid.<br />
Now to the rest of the main cast harem: <br />
Big brain Six managed to accumulate the most useless fighting trio of all time. Competing with the likes of Jesse, James and Meowth, Shinpachi, Kagura and Sadaharu or even Megumin, Darkness and Aqua. It&#039;s just as good old schooldays: the sports ace drafted himself the fat kid, the nerd and the girl who is usually dodging PE class, as his dodgeball team just to show off how incredible he is. <br />
So who are the lucky poeple Six and Alice chose? For starters they got themself a crippled hag with a body that is a merge of Kate Moss and Stephen Hawking while having the mental capabilities of Hagrid. Even her magic abilities are as debilitated as her limbs. <br />
She&#039;s followed by an annoying brat. The little Kirby cosplayer has the ability to transform into everything that she gets between her chops. &quot;That ability doesn&#039;t sound that bad it sure has to be of some use!&quot;. You could think that but apparently, little Rose only transforms some parts of her body, and let&#039;s say that &quot;she wasn&#039;t exactly struck by luck when it comes to her transformations&quot;.<br />
Last but not least we have the basic dumb bitch whose sole drive to live is to gather either fame, fortune, or both by using her &quot;feminine qualities&#039;. Trust me if she could access the internet, my my she would certainly be all over the place. But in her world, the career of a soldier is the only way to gain the attention and money she so much desires (or by digging for gold). And such the battle waifu has found her way into the group. However, having the IQ of a watermelon is not the best trait to possess in a leading military position.<br />
She is also as emotionally stable as a certain building in new york on the 9th of September 2001<br />
<br />
<br />
If you made it this far into the review and you think these story and character descriptions suck as much ass as Six does in his wet dreams then you should definitely go ahead and watch Sentouin Hakenshimasu, you won&#039;t regret I promise!<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation. It&#039;s functioning there&#039;s really not much more to it. I mean its JC Staff expectations are met I guess. Bright colors but generic palates. Lame and repetitive backgrounds. Basic character design. I felt that the longer the anime progressed the less I was &quot;irritated&quot; by its mediocre animation. It&#039;s working for what the show is a comedy parody.<br />
<br />
<br />
The music is just on par with the witty and stupid comedy/ dialogue and is very supportive of those scenes. Even though I gave a relatively high score don&#039;t expect killer songs or gorgeous melodies. I just think Sentouin Hakenshimasu was over average in combining comedy with beneficial tunes.<br />
<br />
<br />
As mentioned before this is classic comedy Isekai in terms of story and characters. Both are quite basic but not really generic either. For what it is it delivers above average I would say. But you arent, or shouldn&#039;t at least, be watching this show to see highly developed characters or experience a cinematic story. You should be watching though if you want some blunt comedy and stupid punchlines for a great laugh. Sure there&#039;s one or another cringe and childish gag but who cares I found most of them quite funny too. <br />
As my last words: &quot;You earned evil points&quot;<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just me having a narcissistic touch but this line is oddly satisfying to hear.

    The anime is at its best when it&#039;s being silly, not that it&#039;s good then either since 90% of the jokes end up the same way. Its serious episodes are easily the worst part. They all start from nowhere with a really weak setup and worse payoff and the only thing they accomplish is show how incredibly stupid everyone is.<br />
There&#039;s no tension when needed, and when it needs comedy it just goes for sexual harassment jokes.<br />
<br />
Alice is a very boring robot who took EIGHT episodes to become all fedora atheist and start doubting magic and curses; Snow likes money and shouldn&#039;t love Agent Six because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400797">
        he&#039;s been a dick to her; Rose&#039;s only characterization is that she&#039;s a child and likes food; Grimm wants to get married and is very jealous of everyone who&#039;s dating, and Agent Six is a professional troll who sometimes acts nobly but sometimes doesn&#039;t I guess.<br />
Characters never go beyond their schtick to become something more complex. and I can&#039;t say I liked one single character design.<br />
The anime treats Agent Six like a really strong and impressive dude when all he&#039;s doing is using superior technology that was handed to him by that evil company. This is like saying that the Spanish were really badass for killing indigenous people with guns.<br />
<br />
The only good aspect of this anime is that I found the premise unique and silly. It can be dumb fun if you shut your brain off completely.

    An attempt to be another Konosuba but failed to do so.<br />
<br />
Problem 1:<br />
Story becoming more and more rushed, each episode I checked and told myself &quot;am I watching the right epsiode?&quot; because they keep talking about sh*t that they skipped/never happened in the anime, like wtf dude?<br />
<br />
Problem 2:<br />
Character inconsistency, the art of Konosuba is the fine line between degenerate character and &quot;deep down they actually good guy&quot;. This anime initially still maintaining good balance to that but throughout the episode they went to the fully degenerate side, Snow that despite love money still sometimes despise bad act like corrupt regime, trash politican etc, then later on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400165">
        she&#039;s just let some prince from another country fondle her boobs just for &quot;MONEEYY IS ALL I NEED&quot; and lost depth to her character.<br />
 <br />
Early episode still let you have development between Agent Six and Grimm, how she gets mistreated, how Agent Six waits for Grimm to be revived and taking a stroll with her, etc. But they won&#039;t do something like this anymore, scrap it, and make her like simple brainless crazy witch.<br />
<br />
Music is okay I guess, decent OPED. Art while nothing is standing out or anything still maintain some degree of standard. I&#039;d give the earliest episode 7/10, but the latest episode (episode 8) that I&#039;ve watched. I would give it 5/10, they can at least made somewhat decent seasonal anime but turned it to trash in the end.<br />

    Definitely most people who liked the anime &quot;Konosuba&quot; would like this since the story tempo is similar to it and how dumb and funny it is, well the main reason is because the author of &quot;Konosuba&quot; and this anime is the same. The characters have unique characteristics, how the story line is kind of similar but is completely different as &quot;Konosuba&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now directly to the anime, the story and enjoyment, thats the main part of this anime, characters, they are all cute, sounds, wow, even though it mainly focuses on making viewers laugh, the sounds are still nice, for art, there aren&#039;t any areas where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398775">
        its broken or misdrawn, and changes of faces by the emotion of the character some scenes are intensely funny if I make sense.<br />
<br />
Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh, or smile watching an anime, even though its most about fights, would still recommend to this anime to people who doesn&#039;t like anime which consists of fights, since i&#039;m also one of them. Best anime of this season.

    When I had heard that this was from the same person, who did Konosuba, I was instantly ready and picked this up for this season, and honestly so far, I&#039;ve been a bit disappointed. I wouldn&#039;t call this show bad, as there are many elements that make it work. But comparing it to Konosuba? Konosuba is for sure better in terms of it&#039;s humor. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Story and characters.<br />
Sentouin sends Six and an android in Alice, on a mission of exploration and for idea of world conquest, Setting up the idea for a going to another world type of show. The people that sent them,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review394278">
        are an evil organization bent on world domination, in order to achieve that, one must explore first and foremost. With many angles following a comedic and &#039;evil&#039; fashion, which depending your tastes, can lead to some comedic moments. I say that, as I do feel at times, the show is trying too hard to be funny, and it just doesn&#039;t work for me, but it may for you. Not that it takes away much from the show, but some of it&#039;s jokes aren&#039;t that good.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, they&#039;re the big reason this show does well. If it were just Six and Alice, I might have just passed this show for a bit, even if their chemistry is real good. it&#039;s the additions that they&#039;ve made that are real good. From Grimm whom I just love, really love, to Snow, to Rose, etc. These sorts of characters have helped push the show along, for good reason. Something the show does right, is have great cast members, that make for an entertaining watch.<br />
<br />
Art and sound<br />
I can&#039;t really complain in this department at all really. It all seems fine and dandy. Both being fitting for purpose in each and every scene, and something that the anime really does right from start to finish. The style is great, the sound is great, there are no issues from me when it comes to this, and a reason as to why the score isn&#039;t lower.<br />
<br />
While I have mixed feelings on this show, and that to me, it won&#039;t be as good as Konosuba, but it still stands out on it&#039;s own, and makes for an entertaining watch. Go check it out for sure.

    Combatants Will be Dispatched is an anime about a evil futuristic corporation that isekais Combat Agent 6, the main protagonist, to a fantasy land in order to secure and conquer it for the corporation. Along for the ride is the smart-talking and highly intelligent android Alice.<br />
<br />
The story is a mess. The pacing is all over the place and most of the episodes are individual contained arcs. However unlike konosuba, there is an insanely fast narrative progression that makes this story format really difficult to follow. Massive developments happen that fail to relate whatsoever to the plot because it&#039;s only related to a single episode. Konosuba

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403686">
        progressed as a slow isekai comedy, with small, gradual changes that occurred in the world over multiple seasons that began to shape the overarching plot. However with Combatants, the pacing is really fast, but the individual episode plots are really laid back and slow. This gives a feeling of detachedness from the actual world the characters are in and makes the plot often feel jarring and detached.<br />
<br />
The characters are the best example of why this show is known as a B-tech Konosuba. You&#039;ve got the &quot;perverted protagonist&quot;, &quot;useless companion&quot;, &quot;crazy loli&quot; and &quot;horny damage sponge&quot;. All the konosba archetypes are there in Beta form. However Agent 6 is so perverted and shitty he&#039;s essentially unlikeable. While Kazuma felt like a cynical 4th-wall breaking isekai protagonist, Agent 6 is basically just a jerk. He doesn&#039;t have as many redeeming moments to be likeable, and conversely, he has too many redeeming moments to be fully evil in an enjoyable way. There&#039;s just enough moral framework in the show that what Agent 6 is doing feels genuinely wrong rather than comically evil. <br />
The supporting cast is mostly composed of very basic caricatures. Alice gets a but of development and she is probably the most entertaining character in the story - working as a good foil for Agent 6. However the other cast members are essentially relegated to their caricatures and don&#039;t really get much development (aside from Snow, but her development is reset every time she starts to change in any way, so I feel it&#039;s still not worth giving any praise over)<br />
<br />
The art is fine, and so is the sound. I like the classic big band stuff, however I feel that it didn&#039;t quite match the tone of the show - a little too light and upbeat. <br />
<br />
Overall it was okay. I was able to dump a few hours into this show overall and it&#039;s hardly unwatchable, but it&#039;s just not worth watching when Konosuba exists, and supplies essentially the same thing but better

    for anyone who wants to watch a fun anime to chill or relax this is one you should go and is also good for the people who want to get into anime<br />
<br />
So, I&#039;m gonna be honest, I was exhausted from watching too much anime last season and have not been able to watch many anime this season, but this was the first one, I finished from this season. so here it goes.<br />
<br />
Coming from the same author t=as the Konosuba the story is funny, if I have to rank them then Konosuba is like S rank, while this can comfortably sit at the A or B

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404442">
        rank.<br />
The main thing I liked about this show which was better and also I held the show back was that this show had a definite story plot, While Konosuba was relaxed and targeting particularly comedy. <br />
<br />
The art is up to the mark, of the nowadays shows, any more detailed art would have made it somehow bad I guess. can&#039;t command the sound cause I don&#039;t much knowledge about that.<br />
But the Op was one of the more interesting openings I have seen and hear it was pretty good as for the ending it was 6 not much I can say or complain. <br />
<br />
The character was the best thing, he didn&#039;t go for the same type as Konosuba that is good, the best character not even being a human, is the android for me. She is the best after that rose. All the character have a special treat but these hit for me and maybe.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a very good anime to watch and enjoyable.<br />
check My other review too ❤❤😆✌✌<br />

    The anime is from the creator of konosuba so I expected it to be as funny as that but it is not that funny. Even so, it is very entertaining, it is very easy to see. What I did not like is that out there the protagonist lacked that step to become more powerful but he is very much carried away with the plot of why he is not more powerful. It is very good as it relates to the group of leading girls, it is fun. I love the personality of the protagonist because he is very crazy. I find it very interesting, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review403778">
        hope they get more seasons, it is very entertaining.<br />
The animation is pretty good but when it shines the most is in the fights, then the animation level drops sometimes in some moments. But within everything it is more than acceptable.<br />
The personalities of the protagonists are very curious, this is very good because they are very unique characters. Also good are the references to konosuba.<br />
The story is like an isekai better than average but I feel like it lacks a little more to be even better. I think if it had more chapters, it would be much better.<br />
<br />
En español:<br />
El anime es del creador de konosuba así que me esperaba que sea tan graciosa como esa pero no es tan graciosa. Aun así es muy entretenida, se hace muy fácil de ver. Lo que no me gusto es que por ahí al protagonista le falto ese paso para volver mas poderoso pero esta muy muy llevado con la trama de porque no es mas poderoso. Esta muy bueno como se relaciona con el grupo de chicas protagonistas esta divertido. La personalidad del protagonista me encanta porque esta muy loco. Me parece muy interesante ojala saquen mas temporadas es muy entretenida véanla.<br />
La animación esta bastante bien pero cuando mas brilla es en las peleas, después el nivel de animación decae a veces en algunos momentos. Pero dentro de todo es mas que aceptable.<br />
Las personalidades de los protagonistas son muy curiosas, esta muy bueno porque son personajes muy únicos. También esta bueno las referencias a konosuba. <br />
La historia es como un isekai mejor que lo promedio pero siento que le falto un poquito mas para ser todavía mejor yo creo si hubiera tenido mas capítulos se mucho mejor.

    This anime is pretty much boring. The first episodes are interesting because you get to learn all the new characters and environment but after establishing everything it gets very boring very fast.<br />
The characters are boring to the core. They do the same generic things over and over and the writing is lazy at best and annoying.<br />
I just felt watching the same episode again with just slight changes. The characters are just an inferior version of the konosuba characters and have no real personality.<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this anime if you want quality. If you feel bored out of your mind and have nothing else to watch
