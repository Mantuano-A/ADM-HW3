    I honestly can’t believe how few people enjoyed this anime. Well, I enjoyed it so let me tell you why:<br />

This series starts where the first one left off and continues to follow Kotarou after the events at the end of the first season. The second season is, by far, much better than the first, but you need to watch the first to get the context of the second. The first slightly gave off a “harem” vibe to it, but it actually wasn’t one. I can totally see why people wouldn’t like it. However, the second focuses more on the relationship between Kotarou, Kagari, and an

        entirely new set of mains other than those two. I won’t spoil any of the new details, but the series follows a much older kotarou and also gets pretty realistic and dark. Also, I laughed pretty damn hard when it suddenly became “James Bond” the anime. The ending was pretty touching, but it felt super rushed. <br />
<br />
(Summary at the end)<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 <br />
Rewrite S2 is an anime that takes you on a journey with Kotarou. The story follows Kotarou as he makes some hard “main protagonist” decisions, grows closer to Kagari, and lives a new life after the world ends in season one. Some of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the season were his relationship with Kagari in an world with only the two of them, the philosophical discussion of existence, and his compassion towards various children with sad circumstances. The story actually draws you in if you can empathize with his back story. In this season, he&#039;s loner and outcast who has the power to control his blood and he slays random small monsters as a kid while calling himself a &quot;hero&quot; or something similar. He eventually makes the hard decision to leave home and set out on a journey to become stronger and faces many tragedies in various war zones, which causes him to mature into James Bond triple solo agent of sorts (watch the anime to see what I mean by that). <br />
<br />
The story itself was actually great, but a different studio probably could have presented it better. I think the pacing was kind of weird and some things could have been examined further. It occasionally felt like they were rushing through some scenes.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I’m often told that the visual novel is much better, and I believe the people who told me that. However, having not played the game, I feel that this series is definitely not a “bad” anime. It’s been awhile since an anime has taken me on a journey with a main protagonist as he makes decisions that could have an impact on the entire world’s future. The story itself was great and well thought out, but the presentation could have been much better. <br />
<br />
Art:6/10<br />
The art is both good AND bad at the same time. The background art and effects are pretty high quality, but the 3DCG monsters did not blend at all.  The action was “meh”. Sometimes the animation felt really awkward, but there were also certain scenes that felt magical and eye-catching to me. Other times it felt like a low budget studio’s anime. Mixed feelings about the art. Same as season one. <br />
<br />
Sound:8.5/10 <br />
The OST in this series is great and there are quite a few that I could listen to outside of this anime. The opening theme fit, but it wasn’t anything too special. However, the ending theme was actually relatively stunning. It reminded me of a music video that tells a story. <br />
<br />
I also enjoyed Kotarou’s voice because it sounded pleasing to the ears and almost poetic. The characters were all voiced pretty well in general, and all of the background noises/sounds fit as well. <br />
<br />
Character:7/10<br />
The characters weren&#039;t particularly unique. The characters all seemed pretty archetypal, except for Kagari, who was my favorite from this series. I would actually say that the characters in the series received a really large amount of development. From season one to season two, you could really get a sense of the personalities of the characters as they slowly introduced the new characters. <br />
<br />
While the characters themselves were&#039;t especially unique, the amount of development that they received helped create a truly unique experience in this anime. I think the character development was spectacular and is one of this series&#039; more defining traits; especially the development of Kotarou. The amount of development in this series allowed me to bump the character section from a six to a seven. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
I thought this series was actually really enjoyable, so I was pretty shocked to see that so many people didn&#039;t enjoy the series as much as I had. There really aren&#039;t any other stories out there like this and if the 3DCG blended better, this could&#039;ve been something even more interesting. <br />
<br />
Overall:7.5/10<br />
This series was definitely something worth watching. I don’t regret watching it at all. We see Kotarou in a new setting, in a different age group, growing closer to Kagari, and becoming James Bond. He’s mainly a lone wolf in this season and the story is unlike any anime that I&#039;ve watched before.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this to you:<br />
Well, it’s really not for everybody but if you saw season one, you might as well see it through to the end. Otherwise, I think this appeals mostly to sci-fi, harem, romance, shounen lovers. It also has a small amount of philosophical concepts in it, if that&#039;s your kinky turn on.

    I don&#039;t usually write reviews but i notice their was only one review for this anime and it was a 1 so i tough i would give my opinion on the matter .<br />
<br />
First the only reason i watch this anime was because season 1 had a score of 6 and this one improved to a 7.4 ( at the time) So i got curios to see what happen since normally seasons 2 has a equal or worst score .<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not going to do a deep analysis just a quick one .<br />
<br />
I watched rewrite episode 1 when it came out and never watched more . I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240413">
        found Season 1 t o be quite boring with a cliche story and i still do . I only watched season 1 so i could watch season 2.<br />
<br />
The first thing you have to understand about season 1 is that this is not a harem , the first impression i got from episode 1 was that this was a harem and since i don&#039;t like them (same bullshit every time the MC never realizes that the girls like him even if they are naked in from of him and screaming &quot;fu** me&quot;) this is not the case , the only reason their are so many girls its because this is base on a game where you can end with different girls but this anime does not focus on romance so much so i don&#039;t this consider this a harem more like a guy is friend with 5 girls .<br />
<br />
With that said  i can confirm that season 1 deserves to get a 6 but hardly unwatchable if you want something to watch this might just do it.<br />
<br />
Now lets talk about season 2! This was a clear improvement in the story line , without showing any spoilers is hard to explain why season 2 was better since the first 3 episodes are pretty slow but you get a greater understanding of the story and it hard to explain them without spoilers .<br />
<br />
i think you should give rewrite a try. Even doe as i said season 1 was not the best but its hardly unwatchable , boring and predictable but its worth watch so you can understand season 2. <br />
<br />
Personally season 2 is great and i never tough i would say this but i&#039;m dying to know what happens on episode 6 and they didn&#039;t even ended on a cliff hanger! <br />
What is rare , most animes / series always end with a cliff hanger to make you want more,  this one manage to make me want to know more without a cliff hanger for that reason alone i believe this anime deserves an 7.6 almost an 8.<br />

    Hmm...you know what this series needs?  A rewrite.  (Yes, I know that joke has been done to death already, but it&#039;s still fun to use.)  Rewrite is a much anticipated adaptation of one of Key&#039;s most well-known visual novels that had mixed results.  Its poor and attempts to compact the source material while trying to finish off its story with an anime original ending created polarizing feedback from those who watched it.  So, for its second season, 8bit took another shot at the series and well...had about as much success as 8bit would have for these kinds of things.<br />
<br />
Story: 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243536">
        To summarize, Rewrite follows the story of Tennouji Koutarou and his quest to save the earth by aiding the Key, named Kagari, in her quest to understand humanity and save the world from its attempt at restarting itself.  While doing this, Koutarou must fight the two factions known as Guardian and Gaia from &#039;saving humanity&#039;, which their methods entail destroying the Key and destroying the world respectively.  <br />
<br />
Rewrite is a very dense visual novel.  Featuring 9 different routes, each of which hold a fraction of the overall story, it&#039;s no wonder where the problems of the series lie when trying to adapt roughly 100 hours of gameplay and textboxes in a grand total of 24 episodes over the course of two seasons.  Focusing exclusively on the last two routes of the game, Moon and Terra, this season of Rewrite fixes a large portion of the problems the first season had, but also has similar pitfalls and wavers in quality in different ways.  <br />
<br />
As far as content goes, Key&#039;s doing what Key does best, and that&#039;s romantic visual novels that have a story pertaining to one individual learning about the world/themselves, usually with magic involved, while providing an overarching lesson to the player for them to think about once they&#039;re done with the game.  Contrary to the first season, Moon/Terra feel a lot more concise and focused because it didn&#039;t have to do the background work that its predecessor had to fulfill.  The entire runtime focuses solely on Koutarou and his growth on what he&#039;s trying to do in order to save the world, and while it does get a little messy at times, is something that&#039;s much better written than anything it was before.  The plot gets a lot more serious, a lot of the pieces start falling into place better, and it&#039;s just overall a better story.  That however doesn&#039;t say very much because being better in context to its previous season isn&#039;t a very high mark to surpass.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that stands out to me for Moon and Terra at the beginning is context and continuity.  The anime thrusts the viewer in an unfamiliar scene and setting that, when continuing on from season 1, doesn&#039;t really click right away.  Indeed, the series is beginning a new route, and thus a new story, but from the perspective of someone who hasn&#039;t played the visual novel and is going into the new season blind, this break in continuity hurts more than helps.  <br />
<br />
Another thing that doesn&#039;t help is pacing.  Dense content, small time frame, pacing issues ensue.  A lot of what this season is about is both personal and public conflict from either Koutarou or the rivaling factions.  But due to how much conflict they need to show in order to get to the end properly, a lot of it feels meaningless.  A character you learn/get to know about may be introduced in one episode then offed the next.  There may be a dramatic showdown between two characters that have history with one another that ends in a flash before moving onto the next scene.  The lack of proper pacing doesn&#039;t give the viewer time to let a person&#039;s death or a tragic event sink in, and that creates a lot less value in whatever trials may ensue.  This problem plagues the whole show, and is even more so shown in the end of the series once again where it&#039;s clear that they were trying to show end by making scene after scene go by at a snap&#039;s notice.  <br />
<br />
Overall, Rewrite&#039;s story is another case of an adaptation that bit off more than it could chew.  The sheer amount of content that needed to be told in such a small time frame muddled the story&#039;s philosophies about humanity and our place in this world and cut away a large majority of the story without much return.  I really saw the potential for redemption in this second season, but there honestly isn&#039;t much I can say when it&#039;s clear that what was shown was only a fraction of the whole story.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Interesting story/philosophies<br />
-  Hard break from the end of S1<br />
-  Some of the worst pacing I&#039;ve seen (even by 8bit standards)<br />
-  Still difficult to understand for those who haven&#039;t played the visual novel<br />
<br />
Characters:  Characters take a dramatic shift in Moon/Terra.  They take such a dramatic shift that it makes my job a lot easier since because everyone but the MC is a side character.  <br />
<br />
Tennouji Koutarou.  The player character.  The MC.  The arbiter of the world who has lived through 9 different routes.  Koutarou&#039;s character is the defining trait of Moon/Terra.  Rather than focusing on the individual girls and largely the conflict between Guardian and Gaia, Koutarou takes up almost all of the series&#039;s runtime due to the sole fact that the entire series is told through internal monologue.  We understand a lot more about Koutarou&#039;s thoughts and understand his actions a little more by hearing how he thinks, and this dramatic change in how the series writes itself in turn makes his struggle and his motivation a lot more personal and in-depth.  However, he still suffers the same pitfalls as the story.  Due to his character being so dense, the pacing made him feel incomplete, as a large portion of his decisions at the end of the series could come up to question.  He&#039;s better, but there&#039;s still something missing.  And the explanation as to why his powers work they way they do still aren&#039;t explained.  Koutarou has definitely improved, but he&#039;s still far from being the complete character that he should be.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast, yes, the literal rest of the characters are all side characters that serve as wrenches to Koutarou&#039;s plans, characters who help influence Koutarou, or those who&#039;ve watched the previous season will become familiar with.  As far as they&#039;re concerned, they only help to move the story along.  They&#039;re no longer a part of the main cast and have no real weight in the situation aside from being the puppeteers who help dictate what Koutarou will do in any given situation.  They help shape the story, and that&#039;s a role they do very well.  Beyond that however leaves a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Koutarou is a lot better of a character (though not as good as he probably should be.)<br />
+/- Side cast isn&#039;t impactful character-wise, but impactful story-wise<br />
<br />
Art: 8bit comes again and mimics the Key style very well.  Using the same style that they did in the first season, Rewrite comes back with a mix of Key&#039;s normal style with a touch of CGI in order to make those monsters feel like they seriously don&#039;t belong in this series.  <br />
<br />
Art looks like Key&#039;s, CGI is still kinda jarring to look at, animation for the fight scenes are semi-fluid, and the quality is standard fare.  Nothing really spectacular, but nothing that looks terrible either.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Decent art<br />
-  Stop using CGI.  It looks awful.<br />
<br />
Sound:  While Key works usually have great, memorable OSTs to coincide with their works, Rewrite doesn&#039;t really have the same feel.  Admittedly the tracks aren&#039;t pushovers, and Terra&#039;s OP in particular has the sense of urgency that coincides with Koutarou&#039;s journey to try and fulfill his duty.  They&#039;re just not anything that I would regard as a memorable track that I could listen to on repeat.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: I&#039;m a firm believer that you don&#039;t need to read or know about the source material before watching an adaptation.  An adaptation should be able to stand on its own merits, and should instead be another medium that you can watch the story through.  As someone who went into Rewrite&#039;s adaptation blind, I can safely say that I have no idea what the fuck is going on.  I had to do my own research of the story in order to get any handle as to what in god&#039;s name I was watching, and doing that entails that the adaptation didn&#039;t adapt the source material correctly, and in my eyes, is considered as a failed adaptation.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t like it.  While I admit the content was good and Key&#039;s adaptations are things that I&#039;m a fan of, its piss poor pacing ruined any form of enjoyment that I may have had from this anime.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about it?<br />
<br />
Pacing.  Damn you pacing!  Aside from that, I&#039;m not really a big fan of Gaia&#039;s ultimate plan because it really doesn&#039;t make any sense.  Saving the world by offing humanity, and there are many, MANY people who are ok with that concept/idea.  That doesn&#039;t really make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I can&#039;t see myself recommending this to people, even if they&#039;ve played the visual novel.  The pacing screws up a lot of its content that I honestly feel like the show could use more than a few passes on how the story should be executed.  It may be a joke that Rewrite needs a rewrite, but there are so many problems with it that it honestly could really use one.

    The second season of rewrite is definitely more coherent and flows better than the first season.  I don&#039;t think it deserves a better score overall though.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Kotarou as he learns how to utilize his rewrite power more effectively while also working with the Key, Kagari, to try and prevent the world from being destroyed.  He does this while being  apart of both Guardian and Gaia throughout the episodes.  I should mention that the battles at the end were kind of a let down.  The ending (spoiler) still has the world being destroyed like season 1, but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243511">
        final battles are not as good; almost all of the action is cut out and all but one or two fights don&#039;t even show Kotarou dealing the final blow.<br />
<br />
The art is about the same as the first season, maybe a little better.  I like the backgrounds and I didn&#039;t find any major design flaws besides the fact that most of the monsters still seem to be animated using 3d cgi.  <br />
<br />
The sound is still good within the show as well, but it&#039;s not really memorable.<br />
<br />
The only characters that get more development here are Kotarou, Kagari, and Kotori.  Every other character from the main crowd in season 1 is only shown like 2-3 times at max for minor things.  They are first shown through flashbacks and later just as young kids.  <br />
<br />
I  enjoyed this season though, despite the flaws.  I think the ending fight wasn&#039;t as good/well done, the sound and art didn&#039;t improve much, but every other aspect seemed better.  I don&#039;t think the show averages out to be more than a 7/10 still, even though a few of the areas improved.  There&#039;s still some things that could&#039;ve been added and if they were it would&#039;ve been an 8/10 for me, like actually showing the final blow being dealt in one of the final fights in episode 11 (you&#039;ll know what fight I mean if you watch the episode), since there was enough build up for it and it just fell flat.  I&#039;d say give it a shot despite its shortcoming, but don&#039;t expect it be any more than just good.

    This is a massive improvement from first season. I didn&#039;t expect this to improve that much to be honest, and, while still has many flaws, shows how an anime studio can learn, even if it&#039;s just a bit, from its mistakes.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I didn&#039;t played the VN so i&#039;ll review this, as i did with the first season, as an anime-only viewer.<br />
<br />
The story adapts the Moon and Terra routes from the VN and because of that this season is clearly split in two parts: Moon route (3 episodes) and Terra route (8 episodes)<br />
The Moon route is rather confusing at first showing as memories a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243743">
        scenes from previous rutes that i didn&#039;t know because the first season adaptation was total bullshit. Because of that, i didn&#039;t care about the main heroines and anything related to them because they are barely developed in the first season, but still act as we know things about them. Fortunately, the entire show focus around the relationship of Kotarou and Kagari which were the only characters worth something in S1, both in Moon and Terra routes, despite being very different each other, while still related.<br />
<br />
Moon was very short and its last episode felt again extremely rushed again forbiding the arc to have a pleasant ending after the first 2 good episodes. However, in Terra finally Rewrite fixes its incredible problem with the pacing. The pacing is smooth and enjoyable, being the entire arc pretty solid with an interesting development by Kotarou, who was a pretty lame and childish character in S1. Plus, the fact the main heroines not being present in the plot avoids major plot holes to the arc, that has a just fine ending which is appreciated in a series with such a complex thematic like Rewrite.<br />
However, Terra is not flawless. Some secondary characters felt like they have a major character arc but they left it absolutely incomplete. Also, some pacing problems to explain some things are present too. These flaws are present during all the series but they are not as blatant as in S1, thankfully.<br />
<br />
The character focus in this S2 is Kotarou in almost its entirety. He was a pretty beta VN main character in S1 but the pathos presented in the Terra arc made him an at least bidimensional character who makes appropiate decisions (and i&#039;m not talking about his power). His behavior is believable too, being a grown and mature character which is rare in an anime of this kind and even in anime nowadays. Not perfect, but hey.<br />
<br />
The animation is average to good. The CGI is very bad and action scenes can feel anti-climatic because of that but 2D animations is just fine, like first season, maybe a bit better. The sound is good, with the soundtrack and seiyuu&#039;s perfomance being quite nice. Nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
Overall, Rewrite 2nd Season learnt from its predecessor. Maybe it&#039;s because they are straightforward  routes, maybe because they are just better routes, or maybe they are just better adapted. No incredibly well adapted, but the pacing is WAY better. And this alone can make this show potable by its own.<br />

    Well I don&#039;t usually write reviews as well but I think I decided to make one because this anime took my interest. <br />
<br />
First of all, let&#039;s talk about the first season a little bit. Honestly I should say that the first season is not that good lol or should I say it&#039;s one of the worst anime series Ive ever seen. The story, the sound, the character, almost all of them umm... nothing good? I think the only thing that actually good in that first seasone is um, art?? lol Well I dont want to talk about the first season that much in here since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241912">
        this review is about the second season, not the first one. <br />
<br />
So about the second season, I must admit it that this second season they really made some improvement with the story lol. For the first 1-3 episodes it will be like meh but for the next 4-8 episodes the story got a little bit tense and I think it&#039;s not that bad. This second season was actually way better than the first ( well at least the first 8 episodes was good. I dont know if they will mess up with the ending or not lol) and for now I think this first 8 episodes deserves at least 7-8 scores. But seriously I think the only thing that they should change is about the music. There is actually no difference between the music in the first and this second season. I mean the ost or the bgm might be fit for some situation but its not that memorable.  Its just like putting some random ost that fit with the situation and then thats it. Seriously everytime I watch this series, I skipped all the OP and the ED except for the first episode, just to hear it for the first time and then I skipped it in the next episode lol. For me  is not that good enough that will makes everyone remember it in their mind or even looking for it on youtube lol. but out of it, this anime deserve a second chance for the story itself.

    first sorry for my poor English. <br />
But I really want to talk how I think about Rewrite.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10   <br />
<br />
Rewrite has a considerable amount of text in the original game.<br />
its not so easy to bring it in to the 2 season anime episodes.<br />
So its must need to cut off some plot.<br />
As a fan who played the original game before.<br />
I could still enjoy in the anime.<br />
<br />
Art   7/10<br />
<br />
Different to the Gurizaia series 8bit doesnt have enough money on rewrite&#039;s anime.So the animation performance is not good.<br />
But the chara design is great! the anime chara design is more lovely than the game. <br />

    Rewrite is a tottaly underrated anime bcz of his first season,and yes first season is trash,but wait there&#039;s another season called Moon &amp; Terra.This season follows Kotarou&#039;s adventures in a real world and his training to become one of the sindycate&#039;s spies.He must become Gaia and Guardian,not bcz of unity of these two company&#039;s,but bcz he want&#039;s to see things from their view,only then Kotarou can choose will he protect or kill Kagari(Key).As we can see in the first season,the world &#039;&#039;dies&#039;&#039;(salvation),and yet in the second season we see him and Kagari on the MOON,Kagari is trying to find &#039;&#039;FOND MEMORIES&#039;&#039; fond memories represents all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251952">
        the human hatred and love,and also their sins.Of course Kagari did found Fond Memories with Kotarou&#039;s help,but if you noticed Kagari isn&#039;t happy about this and then Kotarou is being transported to The Real World.Let me explain:World in the first season isn&#039;t real,it&#039;s not even the real Moon,it&#039;s a Kotarou&#039;s dream/illusion of world he want&#039;s to see,Kagari in the first season isn&#039;t real also,it is just a Illusion of a boy who wants to change the world.<br />
<br />
I will now explain what is Kagari/Key and what is Kotarou..<br />
<br />
Kagari is a God&#039;s &#039;&#039;Savior&#039;&#039; and Kotarou is &#039;&#039;All the humans&#039;&#039;.Kagari&#039;s aim is to destroy the world bcz of all the hatred that humans share in their hearts,but there&#039;s Kotarou who represents &#039;&#039;Good People&#039;&#039;,and Kotarou shows Kagari the way that humans can live their lives in peace and love.Also Kotarou falls in love with Kagari.<br />
<br />
&#039;&#039;Kotarou&#039;s&#039;&#039; been through many death&#039;s of people and he saw their rage,agony and love to live their sinfull lifes.<br />
<br />
In the end,Kotarou/Humans must kill Kagari to save their lives from salvation.Kotarou must do this,HE must free people from hatred and sins they have made.At the end of the series,Kotarou becomes KAGARI and yet another story about life begins.<br />
<br />
Why i liked this anime somuch? Bcz it shows real human nature in the most positive and negative way.Bcz it send&#039;s a strong message to the viewer,and bcz of great development on the protanogist&#039;s and very interesting story about life.<br />
<br />
This is it thank you all for reading this review,live in peace and don&#039;t forget to watch REWRITE!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
WHAT I LIKED<br />
- Character development was well-done as the plotline portrayed a clear progression rather than a typical stagnation, this was expertly done as we were able to dive into the various inner thoughts, thinkings and cognitions the MC had. This is especially important as it allowed the viewers to empathize with him, which in turn affect how we feel about his choices and personality.<br />
<br />
- The storyline is definitely unique and gives

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245827">
        a time-travel/alternative dimension feel. The &quot;what-if&quot; situation is quite a special treat for me as I can&#039;t help wondering how the next event would unfold. I wanted to embark on the grand journey with the protagonist as he ventures deeper into the plot. From a broad perspective, this was definitely a mind-boggling anime that gets you to really ponder after you finish watching.<br />
<br />
- The supporting characters felt authentic to a certain degree, they had their own personality, feelings and behaviors. They had their own dreams and goals that they had wanted to reach, which made it feel more surreal. It felt that the occult club was actually a friendly fun club and the times shared inside was real and heartfelt, especially to the MC.<br />
<br />
WHAT I DISLIKED<br />
- Utterly, despicably confusing plotline and dialogues. There is a complete difference between letting the answer unfold than leaving it unanswered. Too many countless time I was left wondering WTF did they just talk about and how it actually works. Lots of condensed information. The inability to explain the majority of the concepts and the huge plotline was one of the major downfalls in this anime. How can we empathize something we don&#039;t understand?<br />
<br />
- There were many instances where I felt that certain scenes were rushed. Rather than emphasizing and offering a special feeling on the key moments the characters are having, the anime skips those potential FEELS that it may have offered. I wanted to know more about the other characters too and what happens after the story goes on. I am sure as an MC, he would felt the same way about his comrades, families and friends.<br />
<br />
- Fighting scene was amateur as it did not portray any sort of anticipation, the results were highly predictable. An action should have weight in it, both physical and emotional. The failure to incorporate good fighting scene when it plays a major part of the anime definitely a let-down for me. I mean, we have this OP AF character here and the anime failed to show the immense possibilities of his rewrites.<br />
<br />
【=◈︿◈=】LEVEL OF FEELS: 8/10 【=◈︿◈=】<br />
- The feels were definitely there. But could have been much stronger if I had understood the anime more and was able to relate to it on a deeper level.<br />
<br />
Rewrite definitely had the potential to become an epitome in its own genre and individuality but ended up falling off that ladder of success with its confusing storyline, odd concepts and the classical case of WTF is going on.<br />

    So the review will contain SPOILERS. Avoid if haven&#039;t seen the anime. So the first and second episodes were a mess for me. I had to look at summary on Wikipedia to fully understand it. Third one is slightly better at first but got worse. Fourth onwards the series gets better until last two. Last two episodes were understandable but it throws character development and logic out in the water. The ending is worse. Kagari dies at the end as kotarou was late to save the world destruction, Again. It completely destroys the need for Kotarou to kill Esaka. He could have killed Kagari at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review423251">
        the beginning as he had to kill her at the end. He betrays everyone, kills his mentor and gamble humanity just to touch Kagari boobs. He becomes a monster at the end. He becomes completely unlikable at the end as he betrays everyone but nothing happens at the end. The art is nice and no problems for me. Sound is good for most of the part. I only enjoyed episodes 4-9 and they are fine. Many are angry as the first and second season were not a harem anime but I didn&#039;t mind it.

    Well,<br />
I actually really like the rewrite Series(VN), and if i had to say then prob the first few episodes and the last one of this season were the best of the whole anime.<br />
Like it wasn&#039;t necessarily bad, just a little bit underwhelming in comparison to the visual novel, which is understandable if they had to put in that much information into just 12 episodes.<br />
I&#039;d say as someone who read and really enjoyed the vn this was a rather nice resumee, but could just not be good or rather detailed enough to be a standalone anime.<br />
Like you could see the (emotional)potential in each of the scenes(e.g

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243589">
        esaka fight) but there just wasn&#039;t enough detail or length to be completely immersed into those.<br />
Anyways i enjoyed it, prob. mainly because i liked the vn but i liked this one, and i could be mistaken but the vn didn&#039;t have that kiss at the end so it was quite the nice bonus and helped me liking this anime.

    I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SHOW.<br />
<br />
This season was complete garbage. If you don&#039;t want to rage after seeing a trash anime then don&#039;t watch this. Even trash anime has some appeal to it but this was straight up unbearable. Here&#039;s why I didn&#039;t like this anime at all...<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
The protagonist was pathetic. I liked the first season because of the way the protagonist acted. But this season he was completely different. I hated his screaming and crying. I hated his edgy behavior.<br />
<br />
The story sucked big times. The writer definitely could have done a better job of explaining things. I got the gist of it but the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358875">
        way it was presented was horrible. It just dumped a but load of information onto the viewer in a very short amount of time.<br />
<br />
The ending sucked. I want to spoil the ending so bad. It was so bad and unsatisfying. The writer was going for something poetic but boy oh boy I can&#039;t even describe how bad it turned out to be.<br />
<br />

    this is my first time to write a review, i dont know if it was good as review or not.<br />
ok hier we gow, i&#039;ll gonna write my review about both season of rewrite<br />
<br />
first time i watch Rewrite first season it just like &quot;hmm i dont understand why the main hero got stabbed in the beginning like he would doing so terrible things in the end&quot;... so i was right<br />
<br />
story i give it 6, coz i was tought, the story its about ordinary school student that had a lot trouble in their live(s). and just a typical school genre that had super natural issue and gonvernment

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281228">
        secret agent (are they government secret agents?) and it was about that. I dont have much comment about the story it tells about, i just say it just typical KEY works, like angel beats, clanad, charlotte and stuff. just like what my friends told me &quot;HAPPY IN THE BEGINNING,CRY IN THE END&quot;. and unfortunately i dont even cry. (i just regret to watch this).<br />
About the 2nd Season, in the very beginning (around episode 1 and 2) it was just like the summary about all of other ending route on the game itself. the rest story is about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro) doing some rewrite the story by play role as histrueself to not being coma for 10 years after get stabbed by KEY, and his jorney to rewrite the whole rewrite story has begun.<br />
<br />
the art 6, i dont know why this anime it just like 8bit doesnt give their best on rewrite, because on the past, 8bit give their best in grisaria series that was adaptation from VN (Visual Novel) too. it just like HELL, is this really 8bit works?<br />
<br />
sound 7, the opening music was good i never skip the first opening, but i almost skipped the 2nd and 3rd opening about the ending theme, i dont remember how it sounded.<br />
SPOILER ALERT<br />
in 1st opening theme, there a scene that tell us everything about suzuki bond (tennoji kotaro)<br />
<br />
6 point for character.... <br />
for the main protagonist, everything that i watch in the very beginning it was not his true self but it will be revealed in the 2nd season, so i dont give more spoiller more than this.<br />
for Chizuru, she is pretty cute little girl that u want to protect her, but she doesnt need your protection, because she can cure herself from any psyhical wound and not just that, she can do more than you can imagine.<br />
for Kotori, she is typical childhood friend (even she wasnt childhood friend for the main hero at all). you will see how the progress of her role as childhood friend in the story.<br />
for Lucia, a class rep that had a lot of issue about her past and her power. (uhh, i cant describe more than this, if i goes on it just give you spoiler).<br />
for Akane, she is the president of the school&#039;s occult research society and she is 1 year older than the other heroine.(i dont know much about akane).<br />
for Chihaya, a mysterious transfer student that Akane acquaintance. She is a clumsy girl who has trouble honestly showing her feelings and has led a sheltered life causing her to know little about the world. (she had really strong power, so dont mess up with her).<br />
the last Kagari, how does it call? a goddess? a mother of earth? no.The right phrase is KEY. the creator of the game itself!! hahaahhahashit, she look like a ordinary kids but despite of that, she has the power to destroy all intelligent life on Earth. But i dont really understand what her job in this story at all. if her job is just destroy all intelligent life on Earth, then fuck it.. just kill it already, even at the end, earth will be destroyed after all<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5.. i really enjoy about the story, but it was changed in the middle of show, and the ending ruin it, and the 2nd season ending doesnt cure my stresses about the story, i just give it 5 because i just like the beginning of story, the rest of story give me more stresses.<br />
<br />
Overall 7, the whole story in first season quite enoyable, the comedy. the romance, the school activity, the action, the drama, everything was good, but the last episode stab me right in the back bone. the second season..... i dont know why anime from visual novel adaptation need a second season? to give a better ending? to giving more explanation for some unsolved problem? but at least i enjoy the show (evenl the story give me a headche)<br />
<br />
i wish  i can rewrite my memories about rewrite 1st season by wacthing 2 season of rewrite. but it doesnt rewrite anything just writting more stresses on my head....<br />
but i will rewrite my memories i fast as possible by rewatching another anime, or hearing a ton of music.<br />
<br />
maybe my review is unacceptable and to many point that make you guys ever ask WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT IS ALL ABOUT? or even you guys doesnt get my point, that because i&#039;ve never write any review before. so this is all that i can do for my first review.<br />
<br />
REMEMBER this review is about both season of the series.

    To call this a master piece might be much but it was none the less a beautiful work of art. in the first season we see the main character develop with all the other characters as well as the plot that they are all tangled up in. as the beginning is a bit slow in season two i feel like it had a decent pace. however in episode 5 we see everything fall in place. he starts to develop even more and endure a lot of stuff for those who he loves. eventually the show comes towards an end which they do so in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256987">
        beautiful manner. and then we see probably one of the best ending along with one of the most plain endings ive ever seen. if it wasnt for my inner fanboy and inner need for love the ending would of been bad and corny. im glade it ended the way it did but it could of ended so much better. however it could of ended soooo much worse due to the great story and good ending that didnt leave me wanting more or pissed off the way it ended it ranks very high im my book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SEASON 1 AND 2!

    What do you get when you combine a typical harem-romance anime like the first season with a heavy dose of Fate?Zero vibes? Something that completely betrayed my expectations after the first season.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
After the... surprising ending of the first season, I didn&#039;t even know what to expect from a continuation. I have to give credit to the creators for managing to overturn such an ending in a way that didn&#039;t feel like an ex-machina.<br />
Though, I have to say that there were some parts that were&#039;t fully explained. Still, those were only minor inconveniences, and they don&#039;t take away from the enjoyment. The most important one is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289693">
        explained in the last episode.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This is the part where this season is fundamentally different from the first one. While S1 did have some good moments, they weren&#039;t that special or unique, and the main theme was still environmentalism. This season focuses a lot more on the main character&#039;s struggle with depression (which S1 didn&#039;t even touch on) and the consequences of his rash decisions, as well as finding his own way of life, through his interactions with others.<br />
His relationship with Kagari has a lot of dedicated screen-time, but I won&#039;t spoil anything. Go watch it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give this anime a personal 9/11, and a recommendation to watch it if you enjoy both romance and a tough path for the protagonist.<br />
<br />
Also, new OTP. Really reminded me of NGNL Zero.

    There are two types of adaptations (well, not really, but follow me please :) ) : the ones that you can watch instead of the source material, and the ones that must be avoided at all costs.<br />
<br />
The anime Rewrite is the latter. I&#039;ll be blunt: it is probably the WORST ADAPTATION I&#039;ve ever seen, all media accounted.<br />
When I discovered Rewrite, I didn&#039;t want to read the VN (way too long), so I tried the anime. From the very first episode, I could see something was wrong. Even without knowing the source material.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s how bad it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Before I talk about the anime, I have to explain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320543">
        the VN.<br />
- Rewrite has no less than SEVEN parallel stories.<br />
- These stories are all completely different from one another.<br />
- The VN is one of the longest even today (it&#039;s as long as Fate/Stay Night). You can count more than 100 hours worth reading.<br />
<br />
What about the anime? Well, it has 2 seasons of 13 episodes. Do I really need to explain what went wrong? They tried to blend ALL THOSE STORIES into a SINGLE SHORT SERIES.<br />
Cherry on the cake: the writers, as if they didn&#039;t have enough material to adapt, decided they should make the first season as an EIGHTH storyline, including new content.<br />
<br />
The result is a total, utter failure. The entire series is rushed, so none of the scenes have the impact it had in the VN, none of the characters have the depth they had in the VN, and the storyline barely makes any sense because it lacks a lot of explanations from the VN!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Meh. Some things they did right, some things they did wrong.<br />
I like the chara-design. It&#039;s way too simple compared to the VN, but I can forgive that.<br />
I like the openings and endings, the editing is cool.<br />
Some visual effects are nice.<br />
<br />
For the rest...<br />
Everything is way too bright. Rewrite is one of those anime where the lighting is totally screwed up. It&#039;s always all white, like they&#039;re in heaven or something.<br />
Because of that, the colors always look too pale, not vibrant enough.<br />
<br />
The animation is average. Not terrible, not terrific. Some fights are cool.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of bad CGI, especially the monsters.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
Same OST as the VN, and it&#039;s terrific! The anime even has some new tracks, which are great.<br />
Sadly, because all the scenes are rushed, the OST loses the impact it had in the VN.<br />
<br />
A music can be memorable because of the scene it&#039;s used in, but the opposite is also true: if the scenes are poorly handled, the music can lose its charm.<br />
That&#039;s exactly what happened here. The OST loses its impact and its charm. Just like everything else in this anime...<br />
<br />
<br />
For the rest, the seiyuus are great (the same as the VN).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
The characters are always the center of a Key Studio story. Rewrite is no exception. While the original characters are deep and complex, their anime versions lose all that.<br />
Most of the characters stories are thrown away, and even the parts they used in the anime lose their depth.<br />
<br />
As a result, the crew can seem stereotypical, one-dimensional, empty, useless, uninteresting.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
AVOID THIS ANIME AT ALL COST!!!<br />
If you&#039;re interested in Rewrite, you should read the Visual Novel, even if you don&#039;t like this medium. It is a bit long, but it has so many memorable scenes and characters, it is clever, and it is emotional.<br />
<br />
The anime is everything but all that. It&#039;s shit, pure and simply.

    *Someone is literally gotta rewrite the story of rewrite*<br />
This is my first review of anime, so please don&#039;t judge my language xd. Anyway, i just can&#039;t stay in my place when looking this fail.<br />
that&#039;s what i really want to say here:<br />
<br />
Story 5/10:<br />
The story is very complicated to be understand or let&#039;s say, i can&#039;t understand it at all. The VN is better than the animation. I have to agree with that. Looks like they are rushing the story very very very very very much. And that&#039;s making the story very hard to be understand, unless you have read the novel. uwu.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10:<br />
The art is just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261484">
        simply good. Although there are some parts that need to be fixed. Like the hair shadow... . The world detail was just fine.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10:<br />
This is what i love about the anime. The soundtrack is very well made. The music giving the nice image for the anime. The opening is what i like the most.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10:<br />
Well... I&#039;m not sure about the character. They all are cute in the novel. But in the anime version... I don&#039;t know... it&#039;s just looks different.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10:<br />
As far as I&#039;m watching this anime, i don&#039;t caught any problem. It&#039;s very fun, the jokes and the others.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10:<br />
It can be more better. They just have to actually rewrite the story, not following the Novel a hundred percent. The creator too didn&#039;t realize it very much i see. It&#039;s trying to get every route but then end up with terra route... and that&#039;s confusing...

    When I watch, finish, understand and feel an Anime I get depressed after I finish it, thats how I rate an anime. <br />
<br />
This anime made me feel mixed emotions specially at the end of the two seasons. The end of season 1 was depressing and could have kept me depressed for a long time if I watched it while it was being aired but since I watched it  late season 2 was already waiting for me. Of course that didn&#039;t lessen the impact the scenes gave. Plot wise id say it made my feelings dance. Specially season 1 where there are good mix of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289423">
        comedy specially between Kotarou and Yoshino, Romance and friendship between Kotarou and his harem. The lacking of action was understandable and it was also Okay considering their  age in season 1. <br />
<br />
 Season 2 was kinda depressing specially after you build up ships and favorites in season 1. But it gave a new taste to the anime too and kinda a huge leap in terms of character development for the characters. The first episode was really emotional and may confuse other people(I wasn&#039;t) but those scenes was really specially to how the story will progress around Kotarou. Personally I didn&#039;t ship any because it was kinda obvious already AND I didn&#039;t really like Kagiri character wise but plot wise she did blend well. The ending may also confuse some people but if you look at episode 1 and the major happenings in season 1 you will understand why Kotarou progressed to that. It was very depressing but it kinda gives you that peace in mind knowing what happened and you can already guess what will happen even if the anime didn&#039;t continue. <br />
<br />
In short I describe this anime as &quot;Having a Beautiful Story and Character design.&quot; I&#039;m guessing not everyone will like it and of course it didn&#039;t reach the mainstream flatform but that&#039;s okay because this anime is really special

    I didn&#039;t have reviewed the first season so i will also write about the season 1 here...<br />
<br />
The thing is i don&#039;t know how many people liked it or not, but the season was petty good i really like it, the way it look it was the one of the timeline of Koutaro.<br />
When i started to watch it first i didn&#039;t that what is going in until little end then i was got clear to me that what is happening in the story..<br />
The story was good, but the end of season 1 was well i just thought what happened...<br />
suddenly everything just ended .... i was not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281479">
        hoping a ending like this....<br />
Then i thought  there might will be something in season 2 , now the main thing starts from here..<br />
<br />
The First 3 episodes of the season 2 was really interesting to watch then i thought &quot; wow now something good is finally happening&quot;, then in 4th episode everything changed,<br />
The story got completely changed, then i thought  &quot; what is this Koutaro is now born earlier of his mates and now he is trying to run away, this is really happening&quot;<br />
<br />
But at some point he stopped running and faced the reality, in the end i was really happy that the story ended as HAPPY ENDING...<br />
<br />
now for STORY - i have given 10 because of the first 3 and last episodes, i really like the story the way  it was going in these episodes and lead to a happy ending..<br />
<br />
ART and CHARACTER -  i have given 9 because the art and characters resemble me the art and character of CLANNAD ANIME. well but it was still fun in it&#039;s own way..<br />
<br />
SOUND AND ENJOYMENT - well as you can see my score i really like and enjoyed it, i usually uses headphones when i watch anime so i really enjoyed the anime and the sound of the anime.<br />
<br />
OVERALL - 10,  well explained everything above so there is nothing left to write here but ENJOYED IT.<br />
<br />

    I really enjoyed this show.<br />
The thing that made me  intrigued that how the story suddenly changed in mid of the season and at last it somehow connected to the previous story.<br />
Season1 and 2 both connected well and the chain was smooth.<br />
The last scene of last episode was awesome where the two lovers united after a long time.<br />
Our male main character was really astounding and gave many flavors to this show.<br />
I really enjoyed this show and watched the second season after 2 years and really found this show amazing.<br />
Give this show a try.<br />
Many things about this show are awesome. <br />
