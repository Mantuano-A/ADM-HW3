    Well well well, what is there to say about Kamichama Karin? A lot, actually. I was skeptical about this anime at first, because I thought from the picture/description it was for little kids, but I was so so so wrong. Kamichama Karin is a confusing anime, with many twists and turns, and by the end of it you&#039;re going to have your eyebrow raised and your mouth hanging open, saying &amp;quot;...WHAT???&amp;quot; But above all else, you&#039;re going to love it. Kamichama Karin is about a young girl who is given the power of a goddess through a magic ring. I won&#039;t give any spoilers away,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5784">
        but this is the first anime I&#039;ve ever seen where if you don&#039;t know the spoiler, then you&#039;ll look at this anime and think &amp;quot;This really doesn&#039;t look worth watching.&amp;quot; Trust me, it is. This isn&#039;t your typical magical girl fluff. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
CONFUSING. But I liked it. Like I said, I don&#039;t want to spoil it for anyone. I love Karin&#039;s &amp;quot;I AM GOD!&amp;quot; and I read that the author started Kamichama Karin as a joke to the magical girl genre. But nonetheless, the story turns pretty serious, even though this anime started out as a joke.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I LOVED the art. The characters are adorable, with huge eyes and sweet faces. Their outfits are so cute, especially their Lolita-esque school uniforms. The art is quite good, overall.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Well for sound. I loved everyone&#039;s voice except for Himeka. Karin&#039;s is just adorable and Kujyou&#039;s is great!<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Here&#039;s my main complaint. HIMEKA. I cannot STAND Himeka&#039;s character. She starts off really cute in the first episode, but you&#039;ll soon find that her voice will drive you crazy. She talks so slowly, and ends all of her sentences with the same breathy, high pitched noise. Plus, her character is very annoying because you can never guess if she is good or bad, what she means to Kujyou, etc. Take Himeka out of this (or at least fix her personality/voice) and you get a fantastic anime.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you&#039;re like me and you&#039;ve just finished watching Wedding Peach and Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch, and are a huge Sailor Moon fan, but don&#039;t know what to watch, this is the anime for you.

    That&#039;s right, it&#039;s Sailor Moon Greek Mythology time! At first, this series was a parody to magical girl anime, but it turned serious. (The opening scene is crack at it&#039;s finest when Karin screams, &amp;quot;I am God&amp;quot;) One transformation, she receives a heart-shaped thing that looks similar (more like identical) to Ichigo&#039;s Strawberry Bell. Besides the knock-off shojo series, the story improves with time. To begin with, the show doesn&#039;t show much interest in the story and the characters are a little generic: heroine is clumsy and a ball of energy; hero is short-tempered and strong; another protagonist is a damsel in distress; antagonist is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review479">
        clever and easily angered. Keep watching the show despite the strangness-- it gets better.<br />
<br />
What makes the show: the artwork. Koge Donbo (Pita Ten, Di Gi Chartat) created the manga so it&#039;s no surprise that the characters make people scream, &amp;quot;KAWAII!&amp;quot; Karin&#039;s hair is wavy with cute, olive leaves tied as ribbons for her two ponytails while the eyes, faces, etc. for the characters her age are simply adorable. The cute, gothic lolita school uniforms make the viewer want to go into the television, grab the outfit, and take it home for themselves. Nyx&#039;s outfit is an outfit many people would wish to cosplay as since it has the gothic, 19th century motif. The boy&#039;s winter uniforms, however, look more like Harry Potter, only stranger with the large bow at the front. Even though the beginning is generic and boring, the artwork makes one keep watching the show.<br />
<br />
The opening is very gothic and dark, which shows the good verse evil in the series, but in time the evil is just trying to protect something. Like most shojo anime: the bad guys are just misunderstood. The theme sounds more like a broken record that&#039;s about to end it&#039;s time; (or a warped tape) it takes some getting used to. The Ending, however, shows cute chibi&#039;s off to the side spinning in circles and has a cheerful melody one can enjoy. <br />
<br />
The background music has some violin and other classical instruments, which makes the show more enjoyable.The voice of Himeka Kujyou (Noriko Shitaya) adds to the kawaii effect as her voice is soft and sweet. The Japanese cast suits the characters they portray, but Kirio Karasuma&#039;s (Shintaro Asanuma ) voice is too deep and mature for a fifteen year old.  They did a great job &amp;quot;becoming the charater&amp;quot; and using the character&#039;s personality. No countries outside of Japan has lisenced this anime.<br />
<br />
The animation has some computer 3-D animation, but the animation isn&#039;t something to get excited over. The pallet is bright, with some patel shades to give it the shojo style. It&#039;s not horrible, just good. <br />
<br />
Kamichama Karin will make one chuckle at the jokes they throw in (which are many) and smile at the cuteness of the artwork. For those who like shojo anime aimed at a younger audience, this show is the show to see.  Pretty much it&#039;s summarised in one word: cute. It&#039;s a show meant for girls aged eight to 16 or those who are into kawaii characters.<br />

    An absolutely wonderful and romantic anime, yet funny and intense at the same time. You really can&#039;t miss It. The story captures your attention and draws you in from the first episode to the very last. To be honest, the story is very serious at some points, but that is one of the reasons why its so outstanding.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say the most interesting thing about Kamichama Karin is the confusion and the things that make you wonder, &amp;quot;Whats happening right now? I don&#039;t get it at all&amp;quot; It leaves you dumbstruck for some parts, but the math behind it is simply amazing. This anime also includes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4815">
        not only cuteness, but sometimes a very intense atmosphere and at some times can be very random and humorous.<br />
<br />
The Characters. They all have so many different kinds of personalities, yet that all seem so much alike at the same time. I&#039;d say Kazune and Karin are the most interesting pair in this anime, at first their impression of eachother is low, but their relationship slowly develops as the story moves along. It&#039;s quite entertaining, and it always ends with a very heartwarming scene. Trust me, those two can possibly become another one of your favourite pairings.<br />
<br />
As expected! The art of this anime is simply kawaii, just like Pita Ten! Karin looks so adorable in her Goddess form! Not only is it cute, but it goes so well with the story. They all have very unique looks that suite their personalities very well.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say now about the sounds, but one thing I found quite disturbing is when Karin high pitched screams, it kind or ruins the mood a bit, but still very enjoyable and cute. For every situation big or small, they always manage to find a perfect background music/sound for it. It may deeply move you, or sometimes even makes you laugh at all the hilarious ones.<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much all I have to say, you&#039;d really want to see this anime some time. I don&#039;t have anything bad to say about it, I will now continue to the sequel, Kamichama Karin Chu!

    I couldn&#039;t help but instantly fall in love with this anime, which was partly the fault of my love for Pita Ten, another work by Koge Donbo. <br />
<br />
The story, on the surface seems like any other super cute magical girl anime, but the darker, mysterious theme beneath that really grabbed me, just like in Pita Ten. (more so the manga, though) <br />
<br />
Not to mention the tons of secrets that Karin and Kazune&#039;s relationship hides. They slowly unveiled, leaving you to predict what was really happening, and who really knew what. Not much more can be said about that without spoilers, but it was absolutely amazing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1046">
        Especially so in the manga. Needless to say, Kazune and Karin are one of my favourite couplings ever. I can only hope Chu (KCK&#039;s sequel) will get a proper animation someday.

    Ok! I finally finished this series and absolutely loved it! I loved the magic, the romance, and the occasional funny parts. Yes this anime is a bit lovey dovey and I do not recommend it to people who hate those smosh parts but I know there are lots of people out there who like these kind of things! I know I do! Anyways here is my view on things..<br />
<br />
Story: I really did not understand the story at first for the first episode was very confusing and contained many &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; characters that dont get introduced until the second season ....but otherwise, I enjoyed all the weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3282">
        twists and turns and found them very exciting although somewhat predictable. *sighs* The ending of the series was the most surprising yet. A lot of drama though....<br />
<br />
Art: The art was pretty good most of the time and the movement was also pretty good but the thing is..some of the episodes...perhaps episode 4....had the worst animation ever! It looked like an amateur drew the characters because either the character&#039;s eyes were too close together or their nose was to pointy, I cant even describe how horrible the animation was for this episode and some other ones, too! But when the animation was normal...it was okay.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound was great! It gave great mood to the right scenes and the opening theme was flawless! I also really liked the classical music in it!<br />
<br />
Character: The characters in this story was very thought out because each and every one of them had their own personality and flaws. I also really loved Kazune&#039;s cute and sometimes sexist character. I dont know why but I do! <br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoyed this anime and I hope you do too! I think I rated it pretty well!

    I found this anime to be one of my favorites so far. The story really moved me especially the characters. It is a great anime for those people who are looking for a variety of genres. It includes romance, mystery, drama and fantasy. It&#039;s like a magic girl romance dromedy. The main plot of the story is what really brings the watcher more into it. What the plot is about is that the main character tries hard to do her best to become stronger because at first she is weak, she soon finds out about things she never knew, secrets kept from her and falls

    I’ve only now gathered the courage to start posting reviews, so I decided to write about this anime, since I wanted to talk about it since I first watched it about a year ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
This review is spoiler-free!<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, Kamichama Karin. An anime well known for its less than pleasant visuals. I’ve even seen a few memes making fun of the way the characters’ eyes sometimes look way too far apart. And while I agree to some extent, it didn’t bother me that much, since I value story and characters more than how good they are drawn.<br />
<br />
After all, what’s the point of having gorgeous animation if the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373216">
        plot is bad? That’s just my opinion, though. <br />
<br />
And wow… Choosing to ignore that part of the anime was definitely a good decision on my part. I loved the romance, the comedy, and even the faint mystery sprinkled throughout each episode.<br />
<br />
It’s slightly more melancholic than most other anime of the same genre, but not to the point where it’s filled with exaggerated violence or a grimdark storyline.<br />
 <br />
The only reason I didn’t give this anime a 10/10 score is because I thought the ending was pretty rushed and maybe even a bit confusing. That doesn’t overwrite its many good points, however!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I totally recommend people watch at least the first few episodes, especially if you are a hardcore magical girl fan like me! I can’t guarantee that you’ll like it just as much as I did, but I suggest giving it a chance. It’s possible that you may find yourself liking it!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for reading and bye-bye!<br />
 <br />

    I watched this series a couple of years ago in fact and I absolutely adored it, however to all of you who are planning to watch this my suggestion is: watch the anime, then go to the manga straight after. However let&#039;s get started on the review shall we?<br />
<br />
Story: However childish and repetitive this plot seems like in the beginning, give it a chance kay? In the end, trust me, it&#039;s much more that meets the eye. At first you find yourself thinking: great another magical girl type anime, however under the surface there is much, much, more, almost to the point where we get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38148">
        into mild mindscrew. <br />
<br />
Art: I have to give this a 10 just because Koge-Donbo&#039;s art is so darn adorable and cute. <br />
<br />
Sound: I&#039;m basing this score on the openings and endings songs. <br />
<br />
Character: The characters however good they are, are, truthfully, fairly predictable and nothing that hasn&#039;t been seen before in the anime world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Overall this story is very appealing, you have comedy, some romance here and there, your serious moments, and the adorableness of the characters.<br />
<br />
Overall: I give it a 9, while individually some aspects of the show may look dull and repetitive, in it&#039;s entirety this series is quite original and very enjoyable through and through. While it does have it&#039;s serious parts, it is not a bad watch if your looking for something a little carefree and relaxing, while having a plot at the same time.

    Just AWFUL! It&#039;s really sad how Koge Donbo&#039;s work in the anime always gets ripped apart like this! The anime avoids the serious parts. The character&#039;s relationships don&#039;t develop like they do in the manga. It&#039;s horrible. The only good thing about this anime is the music, that&#039;s it. The artwork gets really poor too! I noticed in one episode, Karin&#039;s eyes were so far apart! I just shook my head in disgust. I suggest for everyone out there to read the manga to see what I mean!

    This show started out like one of the most amazing shoujo anime I&#039;ve seen and slowly became an unbearable waste of time.<br />
The show starts out with lots of mystery, intriguing characters, excellent pace and buildup, it catches you completely off guard with its dark and melancholic themes as you expect a sugary positive magical girl cliche. The characters are amazing and deliver lots of genuine emotions and easy to relate drama.<br />
Around the middle mark the show starts filling out with fillers, episodes that go practically nowhere, no clear antagonist and a complete ignore of vital questions and puzzles the story set up. The last episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106807">
        come up with a quick last-minute drama that really just comes off as a flat stock cliche with little heart or mind.<br />
The animation of the show is never really good or even average. The early episodes are good enough to forgive what seems to be budget problems, but over all there&#039;s as less movement as possible and the camera angles are repetitive and automatic. The art is somewhere from little-detailed to sketchy, but the character design sure is compelling (the manga art is stunning). Also the characters change their clothes a lot which is also pleasant for the eyes.<br />
Over the first episodes I developed incredible high expectations from the show and maybe that&#039;s why I got so disappointed from it at the end.<br />
Still I recommend to check it if you&#039;re interested in dark, angsty and romantic shoujo.

I grew up with anime ever since I was five years old and saw my very first episode of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; on TV. I also grew up with Studio Ghibli films. Anime was always there, but I didn&#039;t realize what it truly was until I was about 10 years old. My older sister was starting to get into anime, and so naturally I followed in her footsteps, because older siblings were cool, yo. We got into reading manga, but there was a problem: my parents were a bit strict

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214081">
        on ratings. My sister could read manga that said &quot;for 13 and older&quot;, because she was 13, but I couldn&#039;t, because I was 10. Thus, for the first couple of years of my anime and manga life, I was mostly stuck with magical girls and stuff intended for younger audiences. I didn&#039;t really mind, though, because it was anime and manga and to me, that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
My very first manga was volume 1 of &quot;Di Gi Charat&quot;, characters created by Koge-Donbo, and I loved it. Being a big fan of &quot;Di Gi Charat&quot;, I searched for more of Koge-Donbo&#039;s works. I begged to get the &quot;Pita-Ten&quot; manga (I wasn&#039;t 13 yet) because it was by my goddess Koge-Donbo! For Christmas I got the first three volumes and was so excited I thought my eleven-year old mind would implode. <br />
<br />
Imagine my excitement when Koge-Donbo released &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot;. I ate up that manga like Ponyo ate up ham. Mmm. It also pleased me because I was REALLY into Greek Mythology. Our class in seventh grade spent a whole month on Greek Mythology and to this day was one of the most interesting and entertaining subjects I have ever learned in a classroom. I told my teacher about &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; and how it had references to Greek Mythology! I was so pleased!<br />
<br />
When they announced a &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; anime, I&#039;m pretty sure I almost peed my pants. I watched it over and over, and even made &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; AMVs in the eighth grade *cringe*. For the longest time, &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; was the greatest thing to happen to me in my entire life.<br />
<br />
So what the hell happened? I grew up.<br />
<br />
Now, don&#039;t get me wrong, I love magical girl anime to death. And I&#039;m not just talking about using the magical genre for social commentary like in &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, but the legitimate magical girl stuff. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, &quot;Princess Tutu&quot;, &quot;Saint Tail&quot;, I love these shows! They told girls like me that I can be super feminine and still kick ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; tells me that, sure, you can have all of these cool powers, but you&#039;re going to really suck at them and constantly need help from guys to save your hiney.<br />
<br />
Looking back on &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; as an adult, it&#039;s really upsetting. I looked upon this anime so fondly from sixth to eighth grade, and it&#039;s like it was all meant for nothing. The things I liked about it during those days suddenly seemed meaningless.<br />
<br />
Like the Greek Mythology. How cool of an idea is that? Anime characters harnessing the power of the gods and goddesses? Well, they don&#039;t really do much with it. They just kind of say &quot;Karin, you have the power of Athena&quot;, and don&#039;t really do anything with it. Imagine how cool it would be if they dove into the history of Greek Mythology and tied that to the story, but there is no point to having Greek Myth in this story. You could&#039;ve replaced the gods and goddesses with &quot;the guardians of the tundras of CandyLand&quot; and it would&#039;ve made as much sense.<br />
<br />
Also, magical girl anime is supposed to be where female characters shine. So why is Karin so useless? She hardly uses her power, and when she does, it either doesn&#039;t work or doesn&#039;t have a big payoff. It&#039;s usually Kazune who does all the work (and by all the work, I mean say what his power is, shoot a beam of light, and the bad guy going &quot;oh no, you got me, i&#039;ll get you next time!&quot;). <br />
<br />
Karin is such a disappointing character. I don&#039;t mind that she doesn&#039;t get good grades, I don&#039;t mind that she&#039;s awkward and clumsy, and I don&#039;t mind that she butts heads with Kazune. What I DO mind is how her character is portrayed as weak because she is feminine. Like I said, she never uses her powers. And instead of seeing character progression and seeing her become stronger (like Usagi Tsukino in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;), she learns nothing. What&#039;s the point of a protagonist in a magical girl anime that doesn&#039;t learn anything or gain anything? Instead we just see her fawning over Kazune and Kirika. <br />
<br />
I also think the anime didn&#039;t adapt the manga very well. While I&#039;m not forgiving the manga for its share of flaws, taking out important plot points and characters is just a big mistake for an adaptation. Yuuki is actually supposed to be a more important character in the manga (even if that plot point isn&#039;t written very well at all), but in the anime his character is &quot;boy who plays violin that Miyon likes&quot;. Also, there was a character in the manga named Ami who appeared. She&#039;s no where in the anime. Granted, she wasn&#039;t the most important character ever, but it would&#039;ve been nice to include her. I&#039;m not saying manga-to-anime adaptations have to follow every single thing, but maybe they could&#039;ve been used to improve the anime. <br />
<br />
Also, one of my absolute biggest pet peeves was the voice acting for Himeka. Everyone else was fine, but Himeka was so annoying. I have never heard a character speak so slowly in my life. This is the voice that I imagine if you gave drying paint a voice. You know when the teacher called on that one kid in class to read and it takes ten minutes for them to get through a sentence and you&#039;re sitting there trying not to squirm from the pain? That&#039;s Himeka&#039;s voice.<br />
<br />
So, uh, what do I like about the show?<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I do like some of the characters. Some. I like Kirika and Kirio. I don&#039;t think Kirio is one of the greats in anime villain history, but I wish we had more focus on his relationship with Kirika and Himeka Karasuma. I feel like more people would&#039;ve sympathized with him. I also like Michiru. Except when he gets rapey and decides to randomly kiss people. Eh. I&#039;ve also always really liked Kazusa and wish both the manga and the show had more focus on her, because she&#039;s kind of like, &quot;hello, it is I, a character that is said to be important&quot;, and proceeds to not really do anything important. But I would&#039;ve loved to see an episode focused on her instead of six more scenes where Karin punches Kazune and calls him a sexist pig.<br />
<br />
I also thought the anime did a better job with some relationships. While I was just saying how I wish it showed Kirio&#039;s relationships more, I really liked how Karin was able to see how important Himeka Karasuma was to him. I even liked the moments between both Himeka&#039;s, because we never saw anything like that in the manga. <br />
<br />
The animation is OK, but is pretty infamous for its &quot;quality&quot;. If you google &quot;anime quality&quot; in images, one of the very first things you&#039;ll see is the very infamous &quot;Karin fish eye&quot; screenshot from episode 4. And yes, it&#039;s hilarious. Luckily the rest of the show looks better and they did fix up some of the mistakes for the DVD release, but it still has its share of hiccups, like some more fish eyes, some anatomy errors, hair looking too long or too short, or clothes looking too big or too small.<br />
<br />
Ok, I think it&#039;s about time to wrap this up. I&#039;ve spent most of my time criticizing, so you would think I would give this anime a lower score. And yeah, maybe I should&#039;ve given this a 3 (I give 4&#039;s to anime I find laughably bad). But I&#039;m not going to, because I can&#039;t forget how &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; was a big part of my life at some point.<br />
<br />
I adored the manga, and I did watch the anime almost religiously. My &quot;Kamichama Karin&quot; AMV&#039;s and fanfiction were cringy and not very good, but it did help me understand good writing and good editing. Now that I&#039;ve grown up, I can see the flaws pouring out. But I can&#039;t deny that once in my life, it was one of the few things I clung onto with such passion. <br />
<br />
So, to finally wrap this all up, would I recommend this to anyone? I think magical girl anime fans will like it well enough, although it might not be the greatest thing ever. I think beginner anime watchers might enjoy it too, the same way I enjoyed it when I was beginning to really get into anime. Eventually, though, I think when you grow up you can understand that, no, maybe it really isn&#039;t all that great as it seemed.<br />

    Alright, so about kamichama karin. On the first sight a normal mahou shoujo, with happy graphics. But when you start really looking in it, you will find yourself getting in to the story and feelings of the characters. I must say, the story is quiye confusing at the beginning. It only came clear to me when i watched kamichama karin Chu. But if you dont think to much about it, you&#039;ll find yourself following the story in no time. The characters are very alive and unique, what i really like, and my favorite character of the whole series is..Micchi! I think he is very cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34573">
        and funny. The art is i must say very cute! I do recommend kamichama karin, it has a nice and sometimes sad story line, and some fun characters!

    At first, when seeing the anime cover, I thought this was just another cutesy romance anime. Its not. In fact, its the oposite. This story starts out from a little orphan girl mourning her pet. She finds a boy whom she will later come to slowly fall in love with. She then meets a girl, whom she will slowly learn to protect. Throughout the anime I would litterally shout out loud things such as &quot;OH NO! DONT&quot; or &quot;KISS! KISS! KISS!&quot; It had me jumping the whole time. There is always a twist that wither made me laugh out loud, make me mad, or even

    Kamichama Karin is a anime that includes very well written romance and very cute characters! I thoroughly enjoyed the romance. However I did not like the plot twist, the ending or the last 4 episodes at all. I thought it was overall complex. I did in fact enjoy the humor alot. It has medicore sound and art, nothing spectacular. Overall I enjoyed this anime. It was very cute and it was decent.

    Kamichama is a magical girl anime starring a magical boy, Kazune. There are additional slice of life elements centred around the titular magical girl Karin, but she plays a surprisingly small role in the story despite claiming most of the screentime. Additionally, Himeka plays one half the part of a moe-crippled McGuffin, and a perfectly ordinary student council president Glasses Guy will fill the role of antagonist for the 24 episodes we have to wait until the real characters show up. Finally a boy named Mikorin will provide fanservice in his role as a heterochromatic pretty boy.<br />
<br />
# How Does it Work?<br />
<br />
Karin, an orphan, is struggling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277487">
        with loneliness and emptiness within her life. Enter fellow orphan Kazune, who along with his cousin Himeka introduces Karin to the fantastical world of being a magical girl. Despite the abuse Karin receives from him on account of her gender, the lure of a glamorous and meaningful life proves irresistible. Karin enters the conflict between Kazune and his arch-nemesis Glasses Guy as something akin to a chess piece within a larger conflict. That conflict is resolved with the intervention of characters introduced only within the final two episodes, victory abetted more or less by the power of friendship.<br />
<br />
The animation art style excessively oversizes some cast member’s eyes as a kind of signature, to the point where I felt an uncanny valley-like effect at times. Voice work is average, although the male cast sound generally older than their implied middle-school age. Himeka stands out by employing a speaking style so slow that I feared she might suffocate if given too long a sentence.<br />
<br />
The fight scenes possess extremely little choreography. There is no problem solving or thought exhibited, instead they appear to be merely endurance exercises punctuated by yelling at each other. Nothing materially occurs as a result of them until the final one. And then only with the sense that the writers felt like they were running out of time.<br />
<br />
The slice of life elements work well. They concern Karin&#039;s struggle to get her needs for connection, acknowledgement, and validation met. These feel like what the show was made to do, the middle episodes which focus on Karin&#039;s life attending an exclusive private school representing the best of the show. They are a time of lightly absurdist comedy, romantic worries, and expressive reaction faces. What I liked best however was that even complete shock reaction faces (O_O) had smaller eyes than when drawn normally.  It&#039;s perhaps unusual that the heart and soul of a magical girl show is found in the times when the eponymous character is trying to be a normal girl. But maybe that&#039;s the point of it all: One chooses the extraordinary in order to protect the ordinary because that&#039;s what matters most.<br />
<br />
# Kazune as Emcee<br />
<br />
Kazune is one half the driver of the plot (with the antagonist being the other). He acts as a patron towards Karin in exchange for enrolling her as a pawn on his side of the conflict. Representing an interesting take on the usual anime hero of his age, being a legit magical boy, more or less fine with wearing a dress, and having no objection even to implied homosexuality, he&#039;s kinda refreshing. However, aside from his desire to protect Himeka and to a lesser extent Karin, he hates girls and will explain why by method of insulting Karin throughout the series. By the end all I can really say in favour of him is that damn, he looks good in a dress.<br />
<br />
Together he and Karin live with Himeka in a seemingly impractical 3-orphans-and-a-butler arrangement, tidally locked in a hidden conflict with the antagonist Glasses Guy. The plot of the first 24 episodes basically exists because Kazune and Glasses Guy refuse to talk about anything save fighting with each other (Karin suggests an entente, to be dismissed by both). They both seemed to be living in denial, using the fantastical situation as a refuge to avoid dealing with the grief and meaninglessness that awaited the orphans in the ordinary world. This situation remains static until the end where a new character is introduced to forcibly displace Kazune and Glasses Guy’s tired roles. After 26 episodes, I found this unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
# Karin&#039;s Life vs Insignificance<br />
<br />
Bereft of caring family and by the graveside of her only source of emotional support, Karin does not begin the series in a good state of mind. She responds with anger towards Kazune&#039;s constant disparagement, but lacks the confidence to disregard his opinions. I believe she comes to enjoy the attention from him because she simply has no other source of acceptance or acknowledgement within her life. Simply put, she is vulnerable, and despite appearances this is not a story about her gaining the strength to withstand this. It is a credit to Kamichama that she has such depth of character, even though the show sometimes cares little for her.<br />
<br />
I do have to say it’s disappointing in a genre renowned for women being heroes for Karin to not rebut statements from Kazune that women need to be protected by men because they are incapable of doing so themselves. As a show notionally about a magical girl, why even introduce such statements to begin with? They have no place here.<br />
<br />
There is a daydream sequence early in the series that is telling of Karin&#039;s desire for attention and significance. She grasps the glamour of being a magical girl because it is preferable to her experience in the real world. And this is the show&#039;s greatest fault: There is nothing for Karin but escapism. The ending doesn&#039;t provide any development for her, beyond the stultifying implication of her becoming the lead of a three-man harem.<br />
<br />
# Romance and Frustration<br />
<br />
Karin&#039;s relationships with women are an interesting facet of the series. However they are left unresolved, and any tension is handwaved away by the end. To the point of simply deleting and forgetting a character! These provided the most frustrating moments for me. Karin seems to be trying to escape the negative dynamic that she lives with, but avoids further developing relationships with people who care about her without also demanding from her. It&#039;s like she&#039;s inured to disregard of herself, and goes on to reject the unfamiliar. I wish the series dealt with the invalidating environment and emotional neglect that likely led her to act like this. I know it&#039;s a show about middle schoolers, aimed at grade schoolers, but there&#039;s a surprising depth of character here that the show neglects to explore.<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s a lot of titillation in the show. Kazune gets close and intimate in bed with another man, is publicly kissed by him, and gets the tired public bath treatment with Karin. She falls for both men and women, is the unwilling recipient of kisses from different men, is propositioned for a threesome, and then abducted via helicopter for an intended shotgun wedding. The show simply oozes desire and relationships, but it’s all swept under the rug by the end. And I&#039;m not sure if any of it was ever intended to be more than fanservice.<br />

# Bonus: Moments I Loved<br />
<br />
*Kazune emerges wearing a dress*<br />
Karin: Kazune... kun? O_o<br />
--<br />
Himeka: Kazune-chan. ^^<br />
--<br />
Fried eel and ice cream.<br />
--<br />
Almost every reaction face because even utter shock was drawn with smaller eyes than normal.<br />

And finally, when Himeka puts a pot on her head and marches off to war like a lone moe samurai.

    SUMMARY<br />
----------<br />
Karin Hanazono, an orphaned junior high school girl, lived miserably with her mean aunt. Her cherished cat, Shii-chan, passed away on the same night she met a misogynistic youth, Kazune Kujyou. The following day, she acquainted with his cousin, Himeka Kujyou, and confronted the chauvinist about his rude attitude. The trio discovered Karin&#039;s ring (her mother&#039;s memento) held godly powers. The godly adventures Karin explored allowed her to face battles with the Karasuma twins, school and family life, uncover the mysteries about Professor Kazuto Kujyou and Suzuka Kujyou, and romance.<br />
<br />
SCORECARD:<br />
________________<br />
Story: 5  <br />
--------- <br />
The plot was good, but not at all original and well-written (giving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346971">
        a point deduct for generic storytelling technique). The story pacing Koge-Donbo managed contained some major plotholes. For example, when Kirio wanted to destroy Karin&#039;s ring, we never knew what he really wanted to fulfill. The true answer about destroying rings came in the last minute, so I&#039;ll have to deduct 2 points for the story&#039;s sloppy pacing. The plot of the anime looked out-of-order. If you watched the first episode, we saw Karin already having three handsome boys who seemed ready to fight and demolish the seeds of chaos with upgraded godly powers. Those who were unfamiliar with the manga sequel, Kamichama Karin Chu, may find the opener confusing and unnecessary. The filler episodes had less to do with the plot (both anime and manga-wise), so the anime loses 2 more points. I gave the anime&#039;s story category a 5 due to its lack of originality, vagueness, and consistency.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2<br />
-------------<br />
All of the characters didn&#039;t have any single quality for me to favor them. I&#039;ll go directly to evaluate the star of the show. *drumroll*<br />
<br />
Karin Hanazono: As far with her being the &quot;shining star&quot;, she really was a dimwit. Aside from her appearing kawaii, she embodied as a stereotype towards women and girls. She never learned any of the mistakes she experienced during the previous battles as she was always impulsive on every battle she got herself involved with. She never even allowed herself to mentally and physically develop from her godly superpowers. She&#039;s ditzy, boy-crazy (in terms of fantasizing Kirika), and complaining quite often; and worst of all, being a doormat. Sad to say, I would rather have her be written out from the show. Judging on Karin&#039;s character traits, she really wasn&#039;t worthy to be considered a heroine.<br />
<br />
Kazune Kujyou: Unbelievably my least or worst male lead in this show. I had more downs than ups when I dealt with him. At one point, he &quot;cared&quot; about Karin, and the next thing I saw was he basically treating Karin like shit. His demeaning, misogynistic remarks about Karin made me want to punch him in the face (much similar to how Karin reacted). This lad&#039;s negative attitude gave me the bad vibe that he&#039;s a two-faced asshole. He&#039;s also the one who was always solving Karin&#039;s problems whenever Karin was stupid enough to not solve her own issues; therefore, he should&#039;ve been the real MC. <br />
<br />
Himeka Kujyou: The secondary damsel-in-distress cute girl of this anime. I didn&#039;t find her much likable compared to Tomoyo Daidouji (both CCS and TRC). She actually looked &amp; somewhat behaved like Tomoyo, but did Karin&#039;s makeover without respecting her consent. The major difference I speculated between Himeka and Tomoyo was Tomoyo had a stronger emotional intelligence. Himeka spent most of her role as Karin&#039;s sidekick or playmate, but not a useful one. It&#039;s also hard to tell whether Himeka&#039;s gestures towards Karin made her a true friend, or even a false one. <br />
<br />
Michiru Nishikiori: A heterochromatic exchange student who&#039;s a year older than Karin &amp; her year 1 classmates. He&#039;s supposed to be a supporting, comic relief character, but I found him overall annoying. When he transferred to school, I went WTF when he hugged Karin and kissed Kazune randomly (and I mean in public!). His pranks were very rude (I liked the crossdressing idea, but still), much similar to a typical delinquent in real life. The only positive trait I was able to get out from him was encouraging Karin and Kazuneto share their feelings they had for each other. The lone positive trait he had didn&#039;t consider him as remarkably likable. <br />
<br />
The Karasuma Twins (Kirio and Kirika): The villains weren&#039;t much better than the heroes. Kirio is just your typical villain whose only role was to outsmart the heroes without a logical explanation. His plots for taking out the godly duo were childish too. Most of his attacks were random pop-outs. Instead of coming up with a diabolical plan, he and his reluctant twin sister continued to make failurific attempts to crush the heroes, only for them to get their asses kicked in the easy way. Kirika was a little better than her elder twin, but I could see her visibly weak as she seemed uncomfortable with his plans. I knew she had her reason for siding with her twin, but she could&#039;ve bailed out sooner instead of betraying Karin. If she rebelled him more, then I would&#039;ve seen some strength growing inside her.<br />
 <br />
My thoughts on the other characters: The other characters were basically bland appetizers. Yuuki Sakurai was supposed to play a somewhat major role in the manga; on the contrary, he was just Karin&#039;s schoolmate with a taste in violin and a crush with Miyon Yi. There were other characters who appeared out of the blue without any further explanations and actions upon their supposed roles. I also found Karin&#039;s pet name ironic because the word &quot;Shii&quot; (sounds cute? NOT!) literally means death (in both Chinese and Japanese. I expected Koge-Donbo sensei to come up with a better, creative name for the talking cat. I got the impression she always give her kitten characters with the &quot;Nya-&quot; on the front). The fangirls of Kazune were a bunch of irritating, obsessive bitches who were only here to bully Karin, nothing more. Overall, all of the characters I evaluated now had a bad amount of unlikability than I remembered back in middle school; and no, I had no sympathy for them all.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
------------<br />
The anime show only left me mostly irritated. I don&#039;t see much of it as a problem before, but now I found the whole thing childish and lame (e.g. Karin&#039;s incompetent attitude). There were a few heartfelt moments, but they did not melt my heart. I only got the impression of an unhealthy romance coming from the lead couple as their relationship seemed to fluctuate frequently. The filler episodes didn&#039;t seem to give out an energetic vibe compared to Cardcaptor Sakura and made me thought they had less relevance to the main plot. <br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
---------<br />
Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were decent. All of the characters were voiced well except for Himeka. Himeka sounded so weak as talking seemed to make her lose a freakish amount of energy. I believed that whenever this little girl opened her mouth, she&#039;s ready to exhaust herself to death. Karin&#039;s voice grated me a lot considering the fact she&#039;s your typical tsundere, especially her constant screaming. The OP and ED songs were fairly rememberable, but I didn&#039;t find the opening song pleasant to listen. The theme song, Dark Heaven, is supposed to feel dark and mysterious, but it sounded more like your typical bad romance song. Both of the ending songs were pleasant to listen, especially the 2nd ED. The 2nd ED brought out good, relaxing vibes to cool you down on a bad day.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
-------<br />
The artwork was cute, but at its lowest point. The colors were rather commonplace, such as Karin&#039;s battle dress. Actually, most of the main shoujo leads&#039; battle uniform and beam colors (excluding Sakura from CCS) were always pink, making the aesthetics less original. The animation had its errors, and were somewhat freaky to look at (link after the description). The buggy big eyes Koge-Donbo drew made the characters (mostly girls and little kids) appear like mutants or freak-eyed aliens. The fashion appearance was genericially lolita, so it didn&#039;t bump up the score. <br />
https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/548153-derp<br />
<br />
Overall: 4.2 (or 4)<br />
-----------------<br />
Kamichama Karin seemed interesting and cute based on the Greek mythology that should&#039;ve been used to make the show outstanding back in my middle school years. Looking back at this show, the mythology concept was nothing more than a wasted potential. Instead, all I got was a set of Greek prince and princess with magic powers that only contained lasers. The characters I had discussed were far from lovable and made you have the nerve to jump into the screen and punch them in the face whenever they started some annoying shit. I would recommend this anime for those who dig for shoujo or anime beginners. I had also mentioned a bad amount of misogyny Kazune displayed; and for those who despise misogyny, please stay away from it at all costs!<br />
<br />
Happy 4th of July to the US viewers and stay safe! <br />

    I really enjoyed this anime. Because it was one of my firsts when i was a kid. Always liked it. However, the art throws me off a bit because they look so young. Overall the anime is quite good and can get quite addicting, as i myself have rewatched this anime many times.

    This was a good one, it wasnt as good as full moon wo sagashite but it was okay. it has a unique theme. its music sucked a little lol but since i watched full moon wo sagashite before this and the music in that is PHENOMENAL!.... lol i guess its a little unfair. its pretty lovey dovey lol but in a cute sense and actually the humor in it is pretty good! so i would reccomend it for a rainy day but wouldnt put it at the top of my list :)
