    Five men, all considered some of the most violent and dangerous criminals in the world await death row. Each one locked in high-security prisons across several continents unbeknownst to each other and, as if by sheer coincidence, break out from their penitentiaries and head for Tokyo Japan. Their goal: to challenge the fighting champion of the underground Baki Hanma in the hopes of finally tasting defeat.<br />
<br />
Baki is somewhat of an anomaly when talking about the series in depth. On the surface Baki comes across as the stereotypical shounen following a teenage boy training to become the world’s strongest fighter, a label currently held by his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295923">
        father Yujiro Hanma. However, when delving deeper into the story, Baki manages to encapsulate the concept of fighting and the themes that tie with such. The struggles, sacrifices and suffering felt when facing an almost unachievable goal, the unbridled enjoyment of experiencing your passion to the fullest and even the jaded, dreary perception that can set in when constantly at the pinnacle of one’s field of interest – all are just some of the core ideas the series is firmly rooted in and all remain prevalent in this adaptation of Baki.<br />
<br />
This version is set shortly after the Maximum Tournament arc, acting as a direct continuation to the past TV adaptations of Baki almost 2 decades ago, but still serves a solid entry point for newcomers of the franchise. The first OP gives enough backstory on its own – Baki wins a fighting tournament and is crowned the world champion, but that title behaves more like a proverbial target on his back, attracting the group of convicts whose unmatched strength had led each to grow bored of life and now seek to challenge the young prodigy. This premise eventually leads to a showdown between the death row inmates and Baki alongside other underground martial artists prominent in past seasons; a 5-on-5 no holds barred match where fights are free to run amok between fighters anytime and anyplace, which would also include various other characters in this battle between discipline and technique against sheer brutality and ability. It’s an arc that easily creates excitement and anticipation as to how such a story will play out, but the execution of this turns out to be a mixed bag depending on your expectations for the anime.<br />
<br />
The plot for this arc, while it may seem grand on paper is actually fairly simplistic; progression and development are both dependent on fights between martial artists with at least one character gaining something from each encounter, from a newfound strategy to beat an opponent if they ever fight again to realizing weaknesses that keep themselves from becoming stronger. One would think this approach would make each fight more meaningful and hold more weight, except that when reflecting back most fights in this show came off forgettable and even sporadic, the latter being the result of very poor structure and pacing. Baki has a habit of introducing new characters and flashbacks at random points in the story, with some flashbacks being as long as 10 minutes in the middle of a match. It’s a habit that seriously disengages the viewer from the tension and unpredictability that this arc is founded upon, to an unpardonable extent with how often this is bound to happen. This kind of storyboarding is what constantly brings down my engrossment of the narrative here as it continues onward, meanwhile the eventual outcome of this arc is seriously underwhelming given how each of the five criminals are written off so unevenly. The lack of a succinct structure results in some antagonists being beaten in quick fashion in order to build towards the next arc of Baki and thus required bringing past characters back into the mix to do just that. Narratively, it looked to be full of ideas and potential develop but lacked a clear direction and framework to present the arc in a carefully planned and orderly manner.<br />
<br />
The character development for Baki is also lacklustre to an extent. Characters in Baki can often be considered embodiments of their chosen martial arts style, with the values and overarching philosophy of each forging the minds, bodies and souls of their practitioners. Through this understanding the show probably appears to be stacked with many distinct personalities to play with at the writer’s leisure, yet it remains difficult for many to leave a strong impression on the audience. Partly due to awkward plotting as stated earlier, but also apparent is a lack in clear focus and development to keep most characters important. The events are often made out as more vital than the characters taking part in them. This leads to not only a declining interest in the fights as the series continues, but also makes the majority of characters used here more likely to be lost in the shuffle and only used when convenient.<br />
<br />
Baki as a whole has always been primarily about Baki Hanma, the protagonist, and his father Yujiro, the strongest creature on Earth both feared and respected by all. These two are constantly integral parts to the overall story as they should be, yet to witness so many side characters be treated so sparingly can be disheartening to say the least. However, my biggest problem with this adaptation when it comes to characters is with its handling of the main character Baki Hanma. This is a problem that I feel is more prominent to those who have followed the series from the beginning and have seen Baki grow from the hot-headed impulsive gifted brat to an exceptional fighter worthy of being called a champion. But in this arc, Baki appears…. different. Not only is his personality more laid-back but his train of thought and subsequent actions at times come off somewhat autistic. It’s a take on the character that I had never envisioned or pictured, not only acting as the cause for several awkward moments, but also frankly feeling like a betrayal of the character that I remembered watching and reading. Baki still receives his own development throughout this arc, moving from a reserved anxious style of fight to the spirited, confident attitude that made him such a force to be reckoned with. Except for when you find out this change and increase of strength is solely due to Baki losing his virginity.<br />
<br />
I wish I was making that up.<br />
<br />
If you were to read Baki in its manga counterpart, one of the first aspects that would catch your eye would be the artstyle. There is a keen eye for detail in not only making each technique such a crucial part of the series, but in making the character designs such exaggerated portraits of strength in the human anatomy. A clear expression of weight and power through this absurdist aesthetic creates a strangely beautiful sense of art that further pushes Baki from the standard shounen manga series. If you were to watch this version of Baki, the visuals would easily be the first part that grabs your attention. But unfortunately, the visuals here are kind of trash. It is certainly an improvement from previous installments, but comparing it to the quality of its contemporaries, this has so many glaring issues. Designs have a habit of appearing out of perspective on different angles, animation for the most part is cheap and the juxtaposition of 2D and 3D animation is so god awful it is near impossible for viewers to take most fights seriously. It also doesn’t help that the fight choreography makes the battles come across more turn-based than a Pokemon game. For one of the most jarring experiences I have ever had for watching an anime. I’m honestly surprised how I can say a show with so many technical issues can still be tolerable, but here’s the crazy thing: I actually enjoyed the show.<br />
<br />
Earlier I called Baki an anomaly, and this entry in the franchise is no different. Baki (2018) is honestly an insane show that should not be so entertaining to watch, from both faults in production and writing. But here we are, with a series seemingly unbridled in taking action and martial arts to the irrational, all whilst taking itself absolutely seriously. This level of sincerity is almost palpable through every episode and makes it difficult not getting drawn into the bizarre logic of Baki, no matter how grating the lack of fluid animation and coherent writing may get. In this arc, Baki takes the leap of embracing its own ridiculousness to evolve into a genuine spectacle for the eyes that is hard to not take notice of, and with the finale acting as a teaser to a possible continuation of the story, I expect that the best of Baki is still yet to come.<br />

    [Minor Spoiler]<br />
<br />
What triggered me the most, is that at the beginning, when they introduce the five criminals, it appears that they&#039;re as strong as Baki&#039;s father. And one of them fought Baki at the first few episodes, but Baki was nothing comparing to him. However, after few episodes the five criminals started to look so weak (like very very weak), which didn&#039;t make any sense. Even two of them together couldn&#039;t defeat Baki. <br />
<br />
Also, during some of the fights, the animation effects looks so weird and childish. It seems like if it&#039;s a video game or something, and it was too awkward to watch.<br />
<br />
The protagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296130">
        character &quot;Baki&quot; becomes so weird in this season and just cares about having sex. After he had sex, he became so strong, which is ridiculous and doesn&#039;t make any sense. In the previous seasons he never thought about these stuff. He was just training. But in this season they wasted few episodes just for him being in love and wants to have sex. Also, he didn&#039;t fought a real fight in this season, so it was a waste of time.<br />
<br />
From someone who just watched the previous seasons before this one, I can say that the writers of this season didn&#039;t even watched the previous ones, and they&#039;re just putting their trash. Netflix over here just want to fuck up every Anime that we liked.

    There are few words that describe Baki (2018), the only one that comes to mind is “violent” which is both an extremely accurate and flawed description of the show. One one hand, the show is extremely violent, people are getting completely OBLITERATED in like three punches but sometimes it feels like it’s really going easy on us. <br />
<br />
TL;DR I’d give this show an 8 (rounding down the 8.2)<br />
Let me preface this by saying I haven’t watched any of the previous Baki animes, so I’m not too caught up with the Baki lore or anything. That being said, the show feels really basic… there’s not much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295927">
        in terms of “story” from what I gathered. That being said, if you’re a fan of just fighting, nothing really tying the fights together beside a couple of words, this show is for you.<br />
<br />
Story: 6 Story? What story?<br />
<br />
In all honesty, I feel like I should give this a lower score, there’s honestly not much in terms of story AT ALL. But I also feel like it doesn’t really matter since the show doesn’t NEED a story either. That being said: one of the absolutely greatest parts of the show would be the surprise element: you have NO idea who’s going to win in a fight (save for a few individuals). This really stood out since most of the time, there really isn’t any sense of suspense when the main characters fight a secondary character or when a protagonist fights an antagonist. But in Baki, you genuinely have no idea WHAT’S going to happen, it really raises the stakes by making every character able to lose from the most hyped up guy to the thirdary character shoehorned in five minutes ago. <br />
<br />
Art: 7 Baki is in this weird place where at some points the animation is GREAT! Someone gets kicked in the face and you can feel the impact… but then it flies back to a still image with camera movement to simulate action.<br />
<br />
I’m in turmoil when trying to review its art because, on one hand, some of its animations seem lazy and half-assed but on the other hand you can really FEEL the impact of most of the hits. I can’t really give it an accurate review so I’ll just leave it with a 7<br />
<br />
Sound 10: OOH The sound THROUGHOUT the anime was near PERFECT!<br />
<br />
Going back to what I said in the “art” section, part of the reason why every hit felt genuine was the sound, from fracturing bone to explosions, everything had a certain weight behind it that I really can’t properly explain. The OST was also great, tracks were noticeably reused but still sounded epic no matter HOW many times they replayed it, and it also boasts one of the greatest endings of all time (in my opinion), the sound of Baki is almost as crazy as the show itself.<br />
<br />
Character 8: I personally like it when an author writes a character with no intention of them being liked by anyone.<br />
<br />
The characters in Baki seem relatively different from each other, but the major disparity between them would be their fighting styles. On one hand, you have the honorable martial artists, each with their own history and methods of fighting and on the other hand, you have the (mostly) despicable death row inmates who focus on more underhanded tactics to win (example, most of the inmates used explosives at least once).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8 Dumb fun<br />
<br />
Baki is the true TOURNAMENT ARC anime and I LOVE it for that.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
There’s not much else to say except: “wow, this show is fun to watch”

    You have to answer only one simple question in order to know whether or not you would enjoy Baki, since what the series offers is really simple. The question is: Do you enjoy violence and nonsense? It is genuinely the only thing that this series has to offer and the only thing that can keep you consistently entertained here. There is nothing else this series can offer you. If you want an engaging story about martial arts and how to develop as a person through martial arts or how to overcome the odds, not what you are going to get. If you want various character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297693">
        studies through confrontations to study the varied mentalities needed to overcome certain odds, that&#039;s not what you will get here. It&#039;s not because these things are not attempted, but because the elements of what I described will fall flat, and as a result, the only possible reason you could have to watch Baki is entertainment.<br />
<br />
To begin with, the series was not conceived for new watchers in mind. It was done as a continuation of the previous seasons already adapted of the series. So if you choose this specific season to be your starting point for Baki, be warned that, while enjoying violence and nonsense is gonna consistently keep you entertained if that&#039;s what you are looking for, there&#039;s a wide mass of characters that will be introduced at you that you will not know, and the series due to its pace and particular arc this adapts, will be a very sporadic and chaotic mess of an experience. If those are pet peeves for you, you might want to consume Baki first either through its manga or the prior anime seasons. The violence and nonsense I can guarantee will be there regardless of where you choose to start from.<br />
<br />
Now, why do I think Baki is nonsensical?<br />
<br />
Well, let me give you a bunch of examples of some of the milder things that happen in the series, since I want the big ones for you to see on your own: By punching a person, a man cleaves another man&#039;s meat off of his face right into a perfectly round meatball. Another man runs on water. While trying to do pull-ups, a man is propelled about 2 meters into the air, alongside the bar they were holding onto, because he is that strong. Another man vomits a grenade. Two men jump one entire floor&#039;s height, quite comfortably. <br />
<br />
Welcome to martial arts, scrubs. You might feel spoiled, but trust me, these things are actually quite mild by comparison of some of the shit you can see while watching this series. It truly barely just scratches the surface.<br />
<br />
Now there are two arguments that the series does attempt to make from what I have watched, and I would like to discuss both. A martial artist&#039;s true strength is equal to their capacity to adapt to every situation without prior preparation for that specific scenario. Your strength is only equal to how many chaotic situations you would be able to come out victorious at a moment&#039;s notice without being aware that they will occur. While I can actually agree and somewhat admire this mentality over strength, the way the argument is made is quite convoluted because it runs in parallel with the other argument this series tries to make. Victory and defeat is decided by the participants of a confrontation. Until both sides agree on who is the victor and who is the loser, the confrontation does not end. That makes the concept of strength quite a metaphysical and subjective term which can be applied to pretty much every style of confrontation conceivable.<br />
<br />
Now how do these two arguments fall flat? Because in Baki, willpower and the initiative to want to get towards is a result is the only thing needed to turn what you intend into reality. If one of the core things you want to display is strength, in order to truly measure strength you need to portray situations in which characters are caught unaware and cannot adapt. The person that is caught the most offguard loses. But in Baki&#039;s universe, the truth is that the person that ends up to be willing to give up first loses. Regardless of how many times they have been overpowered, outwitted or outnumbered, in Baki&#039;s universe if there&#039;s a will, there&#039;s a way. Anything is possible, it&#039;s not even a matter of you believing it is possible or not. It just is. Being stubborn about what you want does not equal strength. It might motivate you to pursue strength, yes, but just because you want it enough, doesn&#039;t mean you will have it because of your limits. <br />
<br />
As a result the battles don&#039;t end up being a battles of might, or battles of the minds. They are confrontations of each participant&#039;s willpower and perseverence. He who admits defeat first loses. Or dies. But don&#039;t worry since you can will yourself not to die. This ends up giving the series free reign to be as violent as it wants and the fact that willpower overpowers the physical realm in Baki, that&#039;s the source of the nonsense. These arguments are also played into the romantic subplot of the series and flatten its impact completely because the romantic subplot feeds into the willpower reliance that exists and that is its only purpose. So if you value romance to any degree in a series, this one&#039;s dumb. It&#039;s really dumb. But personally, I found it hilarious for that very reason. But I shall not spoil you by explaining why.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, I enjoyed Baki. I did not need Baki to be logical in order for me to be consistently entertained by big muscly men brutally trying to defeat each other in whatever ways they deemed apropriate that most people would not. I would&#039;ve definitely thought higher of it if it had made logical sense. But I understand that&#039;s not what Baki as a series is about. As Baki is, it feels incomplete. It lacks elements that make me care about what is happening on screen. I could not care about the result of any of the fights because everything in the ongoing process was obvious that is gonna proceed until someone gives up. Regardless of how thoroughly destroyed their bodies ended up being. But when the only element driving your characters forward is their willpower, they feel empty. They are shallow representations and excuses to create confrontations. The result is irrelevant. Eventually the characters that best represent what the author thinks are gonna win because those characters will be willed into a winning position. I could enjoy what was presented, but not fully.<br />
<br />
There are some elements that are obstacles to consuming Baki as an enjoyable experience, even if you enjoy violence and nonsense that much. The biggest is the fact that the fights are portrayed through both CG animation and 2D animation. Now think what you will about CG, be it positive or negative, but when you have a fight occur in both 2D and 3D, where a character is hit in the face by a choppy 3D texture and they react with a 2D close up shot, then the fight continues in 3D whenever the fighters aren&#039;t getting a close up, you will feel cheated out of the experience because what you see is continuously inconsistent. Another thing is the fact that Baki seemed to have a very limited budget and as a result, especially by the end of the series, it ended up having very long flashbacks to things that happen previously in the series, for as much as 5 minutes even. The fact that the series has very limited budget also resulted in the series having a very limited soundtrack, which ended up being reused in a number of situations. Due to how limited the OST was, the flashbacks seemed exactly like the same experience played in exactly the same way as in the prior episodes, minus the blue tint, and it was very obvious that they were padding for time. Plenty of the animation being composed of still shots with moving backgrounds or close ups with motion effects of the characters also make the limited budget quite obvious as well, which is a shame, because the events that occur in Baki with a higher budget could be quite a spectacle to behold. And some of the sound effects for how punches and certain body parts get hit got quite repetitive since they got reused a bunch. So take note of these faults as well while watching Baki. Not all episodes are like that, and some of its more crucial moments are delivered without these faults holding the series back, but, these faults exist in the series.<br />
<br />
To sum up, watch Baki if you find appeal in violence and when you thoroughly enjoy when something that is nonsensical is presented to you. Avoid it if you need good production values and you need to think highly of the experience before you. You can end up liking Baki, but respecting its rationality is not something I see happening for any viewers whatsoever. Baki can be intriguing so long as you only choose to observe what is happening rather than think what is going on. It was crafted as an experience for you to enjoy. And the two elements I presented in the question at the start of review, are exactly what this experience is rooted upon.

    Netflix has come to reward us once again with some nu-anime. It starts with the most epic rock metal solo known to mankind, followed by muscle Jesuses and GAR Moseses posing while looking like the manly and badass they are. Then they start fighting each others and I don&#039;t know what the fuck, but this is the most godawesome thing I have seen since Netero and Zero invaded the palace in Hunter x Hunter.<br />
<br />
There aren&#039;t great many things that I appreciate more than manly and bro. It rhymes so you know its legitimate. What Baki does is not simply bromaculous or over the top manliness:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285162">
        it&#039;s the pinnacle of sakigake. Promoting Be A Man like the whole universe revolves around it, and based to the narrative: the world truly works this way. Not only that, this is also the most educational animanga after Holyland when it comes to martial arts.. or at least it would be if the real sports were around 17 times more manly.  <br />
<br />
This series is very straight forwards and simple. It can only be liked for one thing, and those who never appreciated GAR, will have very low chances of finding this to be anything special. But I, for one, could not be happier. Now I pray for the merciful bros at Netflix: Do Angel Densetsu next. <br />
<br />
Oh, and watching this without seeing the first 2 seasons is a thing women and children would do. Real man would never do such a thing. (quote from S01, altered, obviously).

    I didn&#039;t know about the original anime until netflix started the 2018 adaptation. Being an otaku of anime I try to watch all originals before or after seeing the adaptation. After episode 4 of the 2018 version I binged all of Baki the Grappler. I fell in love with the original- a story of growing up, passing romantic and professional ambiguities, breaking the parental fallacy, the ties that allow us to accept new people in our lives based on a common interest or shared experiences, self development, and extended brotherhoods. I was finally happy to find another anime to call Epic.<br />
<br />
This adaptation, which seems to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289879">
        start well with some funny and impressive characters, ends up being an insult to the original. <br />
<br />
Baki&#039;s look in his eyes is that of lack of intelligence not that of existential confusion with a mix of determination. The lack of imagination is really pathetic. In a particular case, half the episode was a rewrite and contradiction to the original anime. The fights don&#039;t develop in an interesting manner, there&#039;s only a couple of characters with intriguing fighting abilities.<br />
<br />
All fights are about speed and strength, very little has to do with techniques but rather repetitive brawls where the contextual implication is that suddenly another character is in fact faster and stronger than the other- no fountain of strength, no continuous unraveling of quirky draw dropping skills. <br />
<br />
As a person who leaves a little time on Sundays to look at anime, because there&#039;s always something to do, I feel cheated out of 80% of the time I spent watching it.<br />
<br />
The Netflix formula so far for anime has been aggregating pieces from other anime(s) and an added exaggeration or &quot;americanization&quot; to the likable absurdities of classic anime&#039;s such as: Rouroni Kenshin, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, Hitman Reborn, Trigun, etc. It was okay the first times around, when Netflix started making animes, but this crossed the line. <br />
<br />
Baki cannot be phased by some glass going to his eyes, come on, he&#039;s past that already in the original anime. Murderous intent is the only thing anybody has in this anime, all the characters lack style. <br />
<br />
I would gladly forget ever seeing this, Bleach and One Piece have tempted me from time to time with all the filler nonsense, but they had my heart before so they at least did well, Netflix just shoved me some lame excuse. <br />
<br />
Even if the Story is based on another arch, i doubt its as bad as the anime.

    I really love the Baki franchise so I guess a score of 7 seems pretty harsh but I&#039;ve got good reason for it.<br />
<br />
To start with I guess I&#039;ll go into the Art. The animation started off really bad, being a mix of poor computer animation and CGI. It gets better right away when they lose the cheap CG fight scenes, but the animation quality doesn&#039;t look much better than the first seasons despite them being released seventeen years ago.<br />
<br />
As far as Sound is concerned, it&#039;s fine. I was maybe hoping for a slightly better soundtrack but it&#039;s not bad enough to warrant much criticism.<br />
<br />
Finally I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284671">
        want to get into the Story. <br />
<br />
I like the plot. Seeing a switch from a tournament to an unstructured conflict between martial artists who escaped death row and the characters we&#039;ve already come to know is an interesting change of pace. But the narrative structure for this series is god awful. It&#039;s just so very, very bad.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit that the series has always been a little slow paced. There were always flashbacks for each character and other characters commentating on the fights, but there was a good balance. Baki (2018) doesn&#039;t have that balance. When characters do fight, there is much less time dedicated to them actually fighting than there is for flashbacks or explaining their weapons. If a fight scene lasts less than half the time it takes for one character to give a science lesson about how he uses wire as a weapon, something has gone wrong.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not just that the show spends more time cutting away from fights than it does showing characters duke it out, it&#039;s the way the fights are broken up and interrupted. In one episode there is about 4 minutes of screen time of two characters fighting, meanwhile it is broken up in several parts by ten minutes worth of flashbacks, some of which was completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
This kind of story boarding really brings down the overall enjoyment of a series. At this point I feel that because of the slow pacing of Baki, the only good way to watch it would be to wait until it&#039;s finished airing and watch each episode back to back.<br />

    [The worst season in all of Baki]<br />
<br />
⪻- Review | Comment and Reflection -⪼<br />
<br />
This season starts off pretty good, and at first glance it&#039;s a crazy start. They introduce you to the 5 antagonists of the arc who are interested in Baki, and at the same time introduce you to the concept of defeat.<br />
<br />
The start is crazy to be sure, but it&#039;s actually a cliffhanger trap. Let me explain myself, the concept of defeat is interesting and with a lot of potential, but when I thought about it, it didn&#039;t make any sense. If what the prisoners are looking for is defeat and not simply fight

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374149">
        Baki &quot;because he is the protagonist&quot;, then they would have fought Yujiro instead of Baki at first.<br />
<br />
Then the other problem apart from the concept and the idea, are the fights. This strengthens what I said earlier that it is a &quot;cliffhanger trap&quot;, since the animation looked crazy and the fights were going to be the fucking best anime in terms of animation, but then they come to you with a disgusting CGI, and the 2D animations are static and infumable. The worst thing is how they lengthen the series, fights that could perfectly end in 2 episodes or less, are prolonged unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
And what angers me the most, they WASTE old characters from previous seasons. I am referring especially to the Karateka of the previous season (Saidai Tournament) who leaves behind the pride that characterized him so much, and decides to learn and implement the Chinese arts in karate from him. This completely destroys the character, since the main characterization of him was his egocentricity and pride, and in addition to being humiliated in the previous season, he now also loses his pride. And let&#039;s not even talk about the new ones ... Dorian had potential, but the end was one more shit, a forced and pretentious personality change. Or we have the blond prisoner whose name I forgot because of how inconspicuous he is, who in the end was another smoke-seller (OH, surprise, Itagaki wasting people and using the typical formula of inflating characters) ... Then there is Speck, who despite not be complex, at least he has personality and imposing and his fight against Hanayama was the best (the only one he rescued). Yanagi is the same as the blond prisoner, but a little stronger. And Hector Doyle is the second and best among the prisoners, despite being possibly the weakest of the five, although he has very questionable actions and his relationship with Retsu seems frigid to me.<br />
<br />
Everyone is immortal. Literally, I do not think it is normal that with such brutality that they attack each other, not a single one has died. I also find it very convenient that the doctor is able to adhere one end to the body and that it heals in two weeks.<br />
<br />
And with this 2 weeks, I go to the penultimate point ... ITAGAKI&#039;S TIME MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE, taking as an example the brother of the medical fighter of the Saidai Tournament, now suddenly he is ultra strong and rivals the prisoners, he is It gives relevance for some reason (?), and all this when not even a month will have passed since the saidai ...<br />
<br />
Finally, Baki turns into Gary Stu. He gets Power-Ups for the sake of it, and for that simple reason the author can&#039;t even develop or characterize him. Baki lost ALL the charisma that characterized him so much in the first season. That&#039;s why I think Baki was a good lead in the first season, but then he gets too bad and he gets horrible, and let&#039;s not even talk about his relationship with Kozue that the construction is lousy. That is why he is the protagonist that I hate the most in anime, and he is not at all underrated as many youtubers say.

    I really wish I could give this 10/10. But the Plot is very simple and straightforward and the art style is not deserving of a 10.<br />
<br />
But what it lacks in story it makes up for the most exciting fights with a lot of techniques from all martial art forms.<br />
This anime takes martial arts to its limits without involving any external powers like KI or Magic. It can get a bit crazy later on if they adapt later chapters of manga. Every episode I wish it didn&#039;t end.<br />
This series also has hilarious, What Just happened comedy. You are taken off guard, and that is personality one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284258">
        of my favorite types of comedy, where you have no clue it was coming.<br />
<br />
This is perfectly adapted from the manga which I highly suggest.<br />
<br />
Dont get discouraged by the starting episodes which uses 3D models for parts of the fight. Its only gonna appear in like 6 episodes and then no more crappy 3D.

    This is easily the worst &quot;action&quot; anime that I have ever seen. Each fight consists of one person getting completely destroyed and then right when it appears that he is dead he comes back and turns the situation all the way around (one person gets set on fire and another gets shot with a gun several times but still they manage to continue fighting). These fights happen every episode and they aren&#039;t even done in an entertaining way. Each one is drawn out with what feels like filler, they are sidetracked with backstories that do not pertain to the fight in any way and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296672">
        of the things that I really want to see are skipped and then told or shown from the perspective of an outsider RIGHT AFTER as if a short time skip was in order. On top of this, there are continuity issues throughout. I can&#039;t watch any more of this and I would never recommend this anime to anyone.<br />

    Are you into masculine but probably very gay men? Then this is for you.<br />
<br />
I decided to make this review now because season 2 trailer came out and I want people to watch it before that arrives since it is a tournament arc. I believe Bakis production was not the greatest thing imaginable. Baki is CG a lot. First half they used in few scenes but in the second half it was everywhere. But Baki has some funny moments and epic fights here and there. I recommend the dub since it was funnier. They had a lot of freedom since it had references to many things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331311">
        and the voice cast was amazing. My personal favourite fight is Speck vs Hanayama. It was so epic. It had good animation, no cgi, and it got my testosterone pumping. It was just epic. Lots of blood was shed during that. It was very brutal.<br />
<br />
Story: So this takes place after some tournament where Baki reigned supreme, so he won it. So he is a very famous fighter for his strength and due to that 5 very dangerous and strong criminals escaped from prisons all over the world like in a nuclear silo in Russia, submarine somewhere in the ocean, an island somewhere in USA, Scotland and Japan. Baki got news from the host of the tournament he won that 5 people are coming after him and talked about crystallized explosives. Baki then happens to meet one of the criminals and he gets beaten fairly easy. Somehow all the criminals gather to the arena where the tournament was held and also our main heroes. They decided that they can attack each other at random so basically when someone is taking a shit, eating, walking etc and someone can go attack him. Then we start to see epic fight between the masculine men and other random shit.<br />
<br />
Characters: The character were mostly ok but nothing special. Most of them were just very stoic and masculine and not much of a personality. Baki and Speck both acted like clowns most of the time even though they are strong. Doyle and Dorian and Speck specialized in weaponry. Doyle went so far that he has blades in his body and even explosives. Dorian just uses random objects and Speck uses granades, guns and such. Yanagi, Shibukawa, Retsu, Hanayama, Doppo, Sikorsky and Baki are mainly martial artists or just pure strength users. They have some neat skills and lots of punching power. But if anything they sure know how to kick ass. <br />
<br />
The first opening is amazing. The song is just great. The visuals are neat and show clips of the tournament. The clips were mostly scenes of the fights that happened. I kinda wished the anime was about the tournament. The fights looked cool and they were epic. We saw the &quot;good guys&quot; fight each other and it looked cool. The song is Beastful by Grand Rodeo. The second opening was kinda bad. The song wasn&#039;t great and the visuals were just shadow boxing.<br />
<br />
I recommend this to people who like masculine men, epic fights and such other trivial things. I recommend the dub since it is way more funnier but I guess the sub is also a good way to go but I personally don&#039;t like it.  But the dub got Troy Baker back into voicing anime. But this anime suffers from kinda personality lacking characters, their not so great interactions whit each other, heavy use of ps2 graphics looking CG especially in the second half. If you can get past that then it is a worth anime to watch. <br />

    I loved the original when I was a child, now after way too many years seeing this sequel was a blessing. And any one looking to watch this I highly recommend watching the first 2 seasons first and dive into Bakis lore. Almost everything about this sequel is amazing, the art style and the music fits Baki perfectly, there is only 1 big problem that I have with the show and that is some  parts of some fights for whatever reason has some not very good CGI. I am know sometimes CGI can work but in this case whenever they splash it into a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285877">
        fight scene it just looks off, nevertheless I know this is an amazing series and even past the questionable CGI, I feel as if the anime will a have a great 26 episode run and maybe they will make another season with the future arcs if they are not included in these episodes.

    Baki is a wonderful brainchild. I haven&#039;t seen a series in so fucking long that tries to break the mold. In short, this anime is refreshing.<br />
<br />
I normally don&#039;t take the time to write reviews. In fact, this is my first on this site, but I find this anime in particular is not getting the love it deserves.<br />
<br />
Others on this site write huge, massively informed reviews, but I&#039;d just like to throw in my two cents rather than get too wordy:<br />
<br />
I have a huge soft spot for uniqueness; having consumes entertainment for so many years, things become predictable and boring when you do them by the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298769">
        book. Sure, Baki is not super proficient in the typical rating criteria used, but I&#039;ll be damned if Baki is considered &quot;mediocre&quot; just because it&#039;s story is less compelling than others, or the animation is not as fluid as possible, etc.<br />
<br />
Baki is amazing; I&#039;ve never felt so compelled to watch every fight in an action anime before. The choreography is so unique and inspired. The story is so nonlinear and piece-wise. The fun in this show is not found in the grand story arc like, say, attack on titan or My Hero Academia, it is in the moments. Ever episode has tons of distinguishing bits and characteristics that make you remember that episode forever.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re sick of action anime following the same fucking rules, the same fucking tropes, the same story format, then give Baki a real try. If you do like traditional anime styles, I&#039;d recommend you try and loosen up and try to enjoy Baki as something new, like listening to a new genre of music for the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. If cannabis is legal where you are, try watching a couple episodes high. The action is so heavy and intense it makes you cringe and jump!<br />
<br />

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
A universal truth: &quot;Nothing only men like is cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched the first half of this with a friend and they hated the hell out of how stupid it was right from the start. Part of the reason was that we did not initially know how little the show would do to fill you in on the previous seasons of the show. Make no mistake; this is not a jumping on point to the series, even though it should have been. Especially later in the arc, they introduce a stupid number of characters from previous seasons of Baki the Grappler without properly explaining

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367795">
        who they are or why we should care about them.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s getting ahead of things. Story-wise, there are all manner of things that the show just wants you to accept as real, and the way that it tries to keep the fights interesting is to add more and more of these things in the middle of the fight at random. Because of this, you never know when a fight is truly over. No amount of damage to a fighter signals the end. Initially, I found this thrilling and refreshing. Never knowing which way things could go kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />
<br />
But the problem is that a story like this actually needs to be going somewhere in order to be good. If the resolution isn&#039;t worth the suspension of disbelief that you allow it, you just feel cheated. And I feel cheated by Baki.<br />
<br />
Instead of building to a climax where the death row inmates were dealt with in a cathartic manner, the villains seemed to be introduced to the story well and then dispatched at random. At the very end, the last two are taken out at the same time, and not really even by Baki. At that point, they don&#039;t really feel like threats. It&#039;s really as if they got bored writing the arc and decided to move into the Chinese tournament arc as soon as possible, which was as awkward and unsatisfying as it sounds.<br />
<br />
And let&#039;s not even discuss the show&#039;s politics. The fact that the villains are death row inmates raises so many issues by relying on us associating that punishment with the worst-of-the-worst kinds of people, which is far from the truth. Worse than that was its sexual politics, which were abysmal. All of the superhuman fighters in this are men, and there&#039;s only one major woman character, whose whole arc is about how much Baki and she want to fuck each other. Not only that, but the story goes out of its way to make this disgusting connection between losing your virginity and the unlocked powers of manhood. Before one of the worst-drawn sex scenes I&#039;ve ever seen, Kozue outright says &quot;I&#039;ll have sex with you if it will make you stronger,&quot; Baki says &quot;No, I want to have sex with you because I wuv you,&quot; and then having sex basically gives him more superpower than he already had. All of his opponents start making horrible comments about how he no longer seems like a dim-witted boy, and is now a man. Kozue, for her part, gets like one line in the season about how she&#039;s not just a prop, before the show literally uses her as a stepping stone for Baki&#039;s power creep. It&#039;s really gross. It&#039;s just made worse by the fact that the show barely even details that they had an emotional bond before the start of this season, so my only knowledge of these characters is that they were dating and wanted to bone. That&#039;s not a compelling story.<br />
<br />
Again, I was interested at the beginning and I gave it a lot of slack. It in no way delivered. I can&#039;t believe this series is even remotely popular.

     This new baki gets a 6/10 overall.<br />
The story seems washed up. 5/10<br />
Art is good in the NSFW scenes, until they start using CGI mid fight. 6/10<br />
Sound is good, the music in the fight is over used but it always seems to pump me up. 6/10<br />
New characters are introduced, but some have similar stories which makes them seem redundant. 6/10<br />
Enjoyment is subjective, and despite all the reasons listed above, it somehow manages to get a 7/10. Suspense is built ( sometimes ) which makes it a bit enjoyable to watch in the afternoon.<br />
Overall 6/10, would recommend if you just want to see some pain olympics.

    Gets a 3 from me.<br />
I haven&#039;t seen any other season or read any baki. Going into this it looked really good, the animation looked sick, the idea and action scenes looked great.<br />
<br />
*Spoilers*<br />
<br />
5 Episodes in it was going alright, there are escaped criminals that are portrayed as beasts and very dangerous and it&#039;s set up baki and his friends will be fighting these guys on the streets no rules whenever they see each other to the death. Alright, I&#039;m excited, this has my attention.<br />
<br />
Then it all goes seriously downhill. The first of the criminals finally has his first real fight. The match is sort of back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298175">
        and forth but by the end it is clear baki&#039;s friend is very superior. This fight wasn&#039;t extremely bad and I thought this was the 1st criminal to go down, he is probably the weakest.<br />
<br />
It just gets worse and worse after the 1st criminal goes down. It soon becomes apparent that these criminals are extremely weak and they get beat down 1 after the other in absolutely 1 sided fights. It became essentially a show of watching professional fighters beat down what looked like randoms off the street.<br />
<br />
Next, in the beginning these criminals killed their captors to escape prison and meant to kill baki and friends, well after those initial jailbreaks there is pretty much no death. Baki nor any of his friends die in these encounters, nor do any of the criminals. The lack of repercussions made it very boring.

    I wasn&#039;t a huge fan of the art style for this anime. It over exaggerates some features of the characters, some in a good way and bad for others. The lips were huge and the eyes weren&#039;t intensely expressive unless the character should anger or some malicious behavior.<br />
<br />
You don&#039;t see the main character in action too much up until the last few episodes which really annoyed me because he is an interesting MC. He&#039;s strong but shy. And his dad is awesome. I wish there was more action from him in the very beginning.<br />
<br />
The fight scenes are epic! I enjoyed them. They do get disgustingly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333513">
        gruesome sometimes. All in all, if you like action and don&#039;t mind the blood then you will probably enjoy this anime.

    the prisoners, who were supposed to be a big threat, are weak of nowhere, the animation is bad making the fights and moments of the manga go unnoticed here. If it is to define this anime in one word it is: disappointing. <br />
<br />
you get excited to see how baki and his friends will be able to defeat those guys who are so powerful they never lost before, but but you end up bored and upset because they took a story that was no longer the best and made it even worse with the bad 3d animation and effects made by apparently an amateur.

    Baki is, without question, one of my favourite anime of all time. It&#039;s a testosterone packed thrill ride of murder and muscles. The events my be unbelievable, even goofy, but the series takes itself seriously enough that they never feel out of the realm of possibility. If you just want a good old-fashioned story of buff guys beating the ever-loving shit out of each other, Baki is the perfect show.<br />
This show deserves all the love in the world, and I absolutely cannot wait for Son of Ogre to come out next year, I&#039;d mark that on my calendar if I actually had one to mark

    I really like the work they are doing in this series, it&#039;s pretty good they even add 3D scenes that are acceptable, to see the series I do not think it&#039;s necessary to see the previous season although I would recommend it, the story is common a boy with super strength is facing the strongest in the world, I like the approach I also like to be taken seriously the other characters and does not leave them painted as to see, sencundarios characters that shine in all exprendor and make that grace to the series, has an amazing animation and soundtrack and without a doubt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285851">
        the battles are a pleasure that falls in love, is for my taste perhaps one of the best of this year (well it is obvious that it is not better than violet evergarden but it is close), I recommend it if ,<br />
<br />
Battles blood and action is the only thing that I say to you that assures but it is without a doubt that you will surprise a lot
