    I’ll be honest here; I sort of enjoyed the first season of DanMachi. It wasn’t great in terms of storytelling or characters, yet it managed to keep me entertained for the length of its run. And I was genuinely expecting season 2 to deliver a similar sort of experience; not overly original but fun to watch. However, what we got with Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II (Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a Dungeon? II) is just tons of the former and not a hint of the latter. This season is an assortment of overused

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318420">
        anime tropes with dreadfully poor execution.  And seriously Japanese LN authors, learn to be a bit better at naming your shit. Please.<br />
<br />
So, in which aspects does DanMachi season 2 fail? Honestly, it sensationally fails in pretty much every aspect that made season 1 a fairly enjoyable watch. The story arcs are all repeated from other anime which has the concepts of adventurers and whatnot and the conflicts feel extremely lackluster. It’s easy to predict how these arcs would conclude. There’s no sense of danger in them and the comedy is totally out of place. The characters’ decisions and actions are mindless and unrelatable. So much so that even a 10-year old’s judgement would be more sensible. The culmination of all of this simply leads to a dull and unenjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
The story continues where it left off in season 1 with Bell Cranel and his goddess Hestia wanting to make the Hestia Familia the best in Orario. In this quest, they recruit adventurers for their Familia, saving some of their old and new friends along the way. There’s not much else to the plot of this season. When the entire story can be summed up in two sentences, it’s not difficult to imagine that it’s lacking. <br />
<br />
This season tried to be entertaining by the use of excessive fanservice but falls flat on its face in the execution. They’re so cringy and out of place that even most people who enjoy fanservice would be annoyed by them. Oh, and there’s tons of scenes in this season in which Bell is pseudo-raped. Some people might even count these scenes as part of the fanservice, but it’s pretty repulsive to watch someone being licked off by a hideous monster of a rapist (yes, that fat girl is a rapist in my eyes) which contributes absolutely nothing to the story at all. <br />
<br />
Conflicts start for the most stupid of reasons like one of the underlings of some other Familia taking a dislike to Bell because of his attitude or another Familia leader wanting Bell as her own. These lead to War games, episodes of hide and seek and monotonous battles which themselves are predictable and dull. There were opportunities to develop these arcs into something that had real meaning and impact on the story at large, but instead, barely anything drastic changes after these battles. <br />
<br />
The first 3 or so episodes were kinda okay even though they were packed with the issues I’ve already mentioned. I’d hoped that the development we’d had in these opening episodes would add up to something meaningful in the following episodes, but not only did DanMachi S2 fail to do that, it just kept falling in terms of quality each episode. I barely managed to keep up until episode 8 but I’d had enough by that point and finished this simply for the sake of completion.<br />
<br />
The characters that were entertaining in the first season are intolerable in the second. Every episode made me cringe. Bell, who was kinda fun to watch, is reduced to a generic MC; kind, soft-spoken and one who’ll go to any lengths to protect his friends. He stumbles upon characters with a dark past and resolves himself to save them at any cost. Not that he was much different in season 1, but I’d hoped that the things he’d gone through would culminate to some sort of character development for him. Unfortunately, though, I soon realized that I’d hiked my expectations too much and all I’d get from Bell in the entire season was just constant “Fire Bolt!”. <br />
<br />
Hestia, who was just about bearable last season, is a bundle of exasperation in this one. I’ve come to hate almost everything about her character; from her goofiness to her fixation on Bell. I’m sorry but waggling your boobs around and then pushing them in the face of the protagonist doesn’t make a character funny. <br />
<br />
The story delves a little in Liliruca’s past, however, all of it is rushed and it seems that the only reason her past was even brought up was just for the sake of it. There’s no real revelation, just bits of it which are vaguely explained. I wonder if there is actually more to her past or if this was all. As for Welf, the reason for his existence in this entire series is because the author doesn’t want to make it seem like Bell is gathering a harem. He’ll say the odd motivating thing and assist the others in battle, but his presence doesn’t have any significance. The other characters are also meh, and I’ve got nothing much to say about them at all. Because there isn’t much to them in the first place.<br />
<br />
I’ve really gotten tired of criticizing JC staff recently, but they keep producing crap these days. I don’t even know if it’s their fault or the fault of the source they’re adapting. Most of the anime they’ve brought out in the past 2-3 years have been failures, and on the surface, it certainly seems that they’re the ones at fault. I don’t know how the monetary side of things have been for these series, but certainly quality wise, they’ve produced some absolute shitshows in this time. Whether it be because of abysmal art and animation, substandard management, lack of resources, bite off more than they can chew, or a consequence of all of these combined, it has been a staggering fall for JC staff as a whole. DanMachi Season 2 falls into the same trap. Choppy animation especially in the battles, and repeated panels are aplenty. The overall animation quality is okay at best. I found myself enjoying the opening though, which was probably the only good thing to come out of this series. The soundtrack in general was unoriginal but partly decent. <br />
<br />
A shit ton of bouncing boobs, unwanted intimate situations to fill the episodes with fanservice as well as to show us how Bell is embarrassed every time he ends up in them and boring ass characters lead DanMachi into a shit hole which is, frankly, unrecoverable from. At least, for me. I’d honestly looked forward to watching this season but I doubt I’d get myself into the next season of DanMachi. If you liked the first season, I guess you could try to continue and watch this season as well. It might be watchable for the fans, but barely.<br />
<br />

    There’s plenty to say about DanMachi Season 2 but first, I’d like to welcome back this series. While the franchise hasn’t been a stellar masterpiece, it certainly has caught enough attention to secure a sequel. Even if it took nearly 5 years, this show obviously has a fan base, one that made this franchise popular for what it is today. That being said, I can’t declare this season as any better than the first season and as a matter of fact, it took several steps backwards. It doesn’t mean this season is unwatchable but certainly not enough to be considered great.<br />
<br />
For starters, you should do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318418">
        yourself a favor and watch the recap episode 0 unless you’ve recently finished the first season. Season 2 isn’t here to spoonfeed you and assumes the viewer is familiar with this franchise. Watching the first few episodes made me realize that the anime itself retains the familiar setting, charisma, and personalities of the previous season. Hanging on to the premise, DanMachi hasn’t been really about picking up girls from dungeons. Rather, it’s more of an anime to explore character relationships in this fantasy world of uncertainty. As some ideas may seem absurd, I do have to applaud the creator in making DanMachi into more than mindless popcorn entertainment. There’s plenty of characters to fill the story and while the previous season had already established its principal cast, we are also introduced to new ones this season.<br />
<br />
With the way this sequel started, it elicit some levels of entertainment from its first episode. We are reintroduced to Bell who continues to improve himself as an adventurer. Now being part of a guild and having a formidable party, Bell also catches the eyes of adversaries. This begins from a party that he and Hestia attends where he gets challenged to a war game. It doesn’t take long for Bell to accept because it’s a chance to prove himself. In that one moment, Bell shows his change from the previous season. If you remember from season 1’s first episode, he was weak and couldn’t defend himself. If it wasn’t for Ais Wallenstein, he’d be a dead man. Now, we have a young man wanting to prove to the whole world that he is capable adventurer. If he and his party wins this war game, it would definitely earn himself the respect he’s been fighting hard for. That being said, the war game arc itself is relatively short and unfortunately, both the buildup and execution is rushed. There’s a lack of emotional impact felt by both the fighting itself and endgame. Plus, I do believe the plot execution lacked excitement and in general, very predictable. On the other hand, I am somewhat glad the anime was generous enough to feature characters besides just Bell. These include characters from the first season such as Liliruca, Ryuu, and Yamato Mikoto. While the sequel doesn’t commit time to develop them, I’m certainly glad they weren’t left in the dust. Of course, Bell earns his spot for being able to keep his promise. While I’ve never been a big fan of his character, it’s certainly a better outcome than seeing an obnoxious individual such as Apollo taking the glory.<br />
<br />
It’s easy to understand why DanMachi Season 2 decided to dedicate its time to focus on volume 6 for the first half. It wanted to establish Bell’s guild as a respectful organization and that its adventurers are no pushovers. By doing so, we can trust the characters this season won’t be weak. Even Bell, who was initially portrayed as an underdog, is now a capable adventurer who others have taken notice. From here, we get the second half of the anime that dedicates its time on exploring new elements of its fictional world. While the Danmachi universe has its world fiction contents, it never seemed to step outside of the box to be something unique. It continuously borrows fantasy elements and even isekai ideas with the RPG-like world. The dungeons, town, and landscapes is what you would expect out of any fantasy adventure. From the second half, we are introduced to a distinctive district that takes the show to a more mature side. This would be known as the “City of Night”, a place of adult entertainment. The plot also builds tension to its overall suspense and even elicits a feeling of conspiracy. While this anime is usually filled with lighthearted jokes, the second half of the show adapts more of an emotional angle. While this seems like an exciting tone at first, it quickly wears out as the main girl involved is a timid prostitute. You heard that right. It seems the anime also applies its usually quirky humor by inserting virgin jokes. On the plus side, it did give a chance for Mikoto to shine. She stands out as the breakout character this season from Hestia Familia. Although she isn&#039;t able to carry the season, I do find Mikoto’s character to be much more appealing than Hestia herself. I mean, how many times are we going to have that Loli Big-Boobs shoved down our throat? <br />
<br />
I won’t spoil the plot so you’ll have to see how they planned out volume 7’s adaptation. From an anime perspective, let’s just say it contains more emotional impact than the first half. Yet, it isn’t going to be a tearjerker. That’s probably an unfair statement to say. DanMachi has never been really much of a series about emotional drama. It unites a variety of gimmick together with its character relationships that tries to each be unique on its own. From the previous season, we had Bell develop bonds with Hestia, Ais, and Liliuca. From this season, he builds a bond with Haruhime and members of the Hestia Familia. The latter is a step backwards as I didn’t feel compelled enough to get attached to these relationships. This isn’t really Bell’s fault as a character but overall with the plot direction. Haruhime and Bell’s character bond is nonetheless important for this arc but doesn’t capitalize on showing emotional effect. And in a world of creative writing, that’s not a great sign.<br />
<br />
J.C. Staff returns with its talent and I have to wonder how far they planned ahead. Likewise, I don’t think there’s any problem with the overall animation quality. Character designs returns in their original forms with a familiar style of combat cinematography similar to previous season. The extended world setting of City of Night adds more adult fan service. Trust me, you’ll understand what I mean once you reach the second half of the show. On most parts, this anime didn’t suffer from production issues. There were no episodes that had drops in quality. In terms of technical merits, you do have to give some credit where it’s due.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t really a season about picking up girls from dungeons. Instead, it’s an extended story on what the previous season had established with its character and ideas. Unfortunately, watching DanMachi Season 2 was a mediocre experience that truly didn’t make a big impact on my enjoyment. It’s feels like playing a video game with a long expansion DLC pack added to the main questline. With the franchise confirmed getting another season in 2020, this is going to be a big season pass.

    I’m disappointed with Danmachi season 2. I was looking forward to this anime for so long, but when it came it was such a let down. [Spoilers]<br />
<br />
The War Games was bad: <br />
• Apollo was like a generic rapist straight out of SAO<br />
• Apollo family chasing Hestia’s family throughout the city in broad daylight. The problem with this is it shows is there’s no government officials to prevent something like this happening between other families. It makes Orario being a peaceful city and not a warzone make no sense.<br />
• The War Games was too short. We had 3 episodes of build up only for the event

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318455">
        to end in one episode. <br />
• Hestia’s family beating Apollo’s was too easy. It was unbelievable that 5 people would be able to breeze through 200 without any serious injuries. Bell’s power boost was so poorly written that I questioned if this was fanfic. He went from getting his ass kicked by a lvl 3, going off to train for a few days and winning the rematch. Why? Because Ainz showed him how to dodge 1 or 2 hits. The problem i have with this is they don’t SHOW us Bell’s training, we’re only given a few lazy panels and are meant to be okay with this.<br />
<br />
I liked the darker tone in the Prostitute arc, too bad it was mainly prostitutes chasing Bell to take his virginity and adding 1 girl more to the harem. We got some backstory on Samurai girl which made me care a bit about her. Fox girl was pretty much a damsel in distress. I hated the reveal in the end that she didn’t actually sleep with anyone considering what made her interesting was that she did ‘taint her body’ and didn’t feel she deserved being saved by a hero. She may not know, but it completely undermines her development for the viewer.<br />
<br />
I don’t know what to call the next arc because it was pretty much a mess. Pacing was eradic e.g. ep. 11 we left of with Bell and Hestia falling from a cliff, the next we’re at a village and everyone’s fine. The only good thing about it was the focus on Bell’s love for his kami sama. However, I wish Bell addressed Hestia’s feelings like he was told so she could move on but instead he does the opposite and said he loved her... That’s going completely against what the story has been built around which is Bell’s love for Ains. Speaking of Ains, I don’t know what role she played this arc besides being a third wheel robot in a love triangle. The glimpse of her showing some emotions over the Black Dragon scales was the first time i think I’ve been interested to seeing where her character goes. I don’t see the point of Ares considering he just disappeared from the story.<br />
<br />
Bell’s development was awful this season. It’s like the same ‘pushover coward to confident hero’ character arc he went through last season, which is why he hasn’t really changed. I don’t like his ridiculous power boosts e.g. other characters take years to level up once, Bell went up from lvl 2 to lvl 4 in like 1 month... <br />
<br />
There was a few decent-good fights/animation e.g. Bell Vs Prostitute onee-san, but the fights and pacing wasn’t consistent enough.<br />
<br />
Overall, Danmachi S2 wasn’t good as the first season.

    Less Dungeoneering, more Familia Wars...<br />
<br />
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II was pretty much what LA expected of a sequel from Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka. World building and character development be it new or old and even if the plot structure of this season are essentially 2 and a half arcs mainly focused on selfish gods and goddesses with similar plot beats with them but the best strengths between both of these arcs are the solid character developments from new and old characters and growing the world building more because of it.<br />
<br />
Well to start off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318438">
        with the Apollo Familia and Apollo himself, sure the entire war between Hestia and Apollo started off what is quite literally a waifu war only intensified into all out war, dragging Liliruca with her current familia Soma (which was slightly delved at in the first season) and Apollo wanting Bell as he&#039;s already become a name in Orario. Apollo&#039;s arc dragged in Liliruca in which she got ALOT of screentime in this arc and we more or less get character development and resolution from Soma, this being said as the Soma familia technically kicked her out but due to a Soma advisor having more control over the familia itself and the god Soma caring more about making more alcohol, the Soma advisor goes crazy with power and siding with Apollo to gain that power from him and get their way as a result. Liliruca either way from this Familia War gains ALOT of character development and ties loose plotlines from the first season. From this however, Yamato Mikoto viced by Chinatsu Akasaki that had a bit of screentime in the first season got a bit more focus as she wanted her debt repaid thus helps Hestia familia from this and at the end of the Apollo and Hestia Familia War, makes a great decision that only makes her better in te next arc...<br />
<br />
The Ishtar arc, which focuses on Sanjuno Haruhime voiced by Haruka Chigusa and Bell stumbling upon her, the thing is Haruhieme is a prostutite in the Red Light District helmed by the Ishtar Familia, striving off black market and the more sleazy end of businesses,  Haruhime either way helps Bell getting out of the Red Light Distrct but Ishtar has other plans for Bell and latter on once the Hestia Familia and Bell finds out...they need to save her. Haruhime as a character is interesting as she like Bell loves hero stories but since she was tricked into becoming a prostitute she just let it happen, BUT she doesn&#039;t want any help from heroes as since she&#039;s a prostitute, she&#039;s the symbol of destruction for a hero thus doesn&#039;t want the help, so Bell being the &quot;always wanting t protect everyone&quot; not only wants to save Haruhime from Ishtar&#039;s plans but to shatter Haruhime&#039;s beliefs of a prostitute and hero dynamic. So how does Mikoto come into all this, well her familia the Takemakeuchi Familia were childhood friends with Haruhime when she was a princess so Mikoto wanting to find her as well as like Bell get her out of there, she in turn gains ALOT of screentime even in this arc and heck Mikoto came a LONG way from the nuisance minor character with little to no screentime to the point she became LA&#039;s favourite character in this second season (Ryu Lion is still LA&#039;s favorite character of the series overall). With all this being said, why does Ishtar want Haruhime let alone her plan?, well one that&#039;s spoilers so LA won&#039;t talk much about that, but Ishtar&#039;s plan, well has to do with Bell AND Freya, YEAH she&#039;s invovled and much like Apollo is vain and selfish using her familia as tools than...you know adventurers and human and Apollo may have been just plain crazy narcissistic, but Ishtar was a plain awfully detestable goddesses, even to the point of her reasoning of her plans and her fate was more than enough (let alone Bell wasn&#039;t really involved in that...*cough* Freya *cough*).<br />
<br />
But do you see something with Apollo and Ishtar compared to Hestia&#039;s familia?. Well for one thing Apollo and Ishtar&#039;s familia are powerful and rich as hell, compared to Hestia onnly hvaing Bell at the start and poor, but going further, Apollo and Ishtar doesn&#039;t really care about their members and again using them as tools more than anything else, hell because both Apollo and Ishatr one way or another eyes Bell, makes their members jealous of Bell instead. Wherein Hestia LOVES Bell and deeply cares for him in the worst cases and when Hestia&#039;s familia grows even though Hestia is a bit iffy with any advances with other girls with Bell, but aside from that, Hestia cares for her members of the familia, Apollo and Ishtar drunk on power and vain...do not care about their members and like the new best face or even more power than anything else....Ares ehhhh he&#039;s a comedic footnote if anything...<br />
<br />
The animation done once again by JC Staff are on form again with slicker, more polished and great battle scenes in the anime and with how intense it gets with Familia Wars and the such the strategy and choregraphy used in the anime was out in out fluid and great for the most part. The aesthetic of this season was the same as the first season but with a crisper tone to it as well. Not much to really say besides that JC Staff updated the animation to be more polished and consistent animation all round this season. <br />
<br />
The voice cast was great and thanks to the expanded cast added in some great voice actors from Haruka Chigusa as Haruhime, Akeno Watanabe as Aisha, Takako Honda who voiced Ishtar and Ryouta Osaka as Apollo. from the main cast, Yoshitsugu Matsukoa did great as Bell, Maaya Uchida as Liliruca and the big underdog Mikoto Yamato voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki did great as well. due to the majority of the anime focused on the other more poweful gods, Hestia&#039;s screentime was lessen dramatically this season thus Inori Minase but nonetheless she did her usual comedic scthick this season for the most part. ALl in all the voice cast was great all round.<br />
<br />
The only flaws LA saw was that once Haruhime&#039;s and Ishtar&#039;s arc finished, Haruhime became like the rest of the harem vying for Bell&#039;s attention and her backstory though full developed..had nowhere else to go which was a shame as she was a great and fully developed and realized character and she became wasted potential (but that&#039;s not to knock the events of Ishtar&#039;s arc it&#039;s just something LA noticed), the other would be that yes because Bell is the expected hero of this story, he essentially wins the entire time but not without hard work and training but he wins all the time, yes there is that but at least this season, he wasn&#039;t the only one set on stage as other characters had their time to shine, from Liliruca from Apollo&#039;s arc to Mikoto from both Apollo and Ishtar&#039;s arc and let&#039;s not forget Haruhime.<br />
<br />
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II was a HUGE step up from the first season and the bland-retelling side story of Sword Oratoria, sure the dungeoneering was slimmed down in favour of world building of Orario and character development from the old and new characters of the cast BUT...yeah isn&#039;t that actually a good thing due to this second season focusing on Orario and it&#039;s familia&#039;s and thus giving us much more in-depth world building with the various familia&#039;s and them having their eye on Bell and in turn drags major and minor characters into all this and drastically changes ALOT be it plot-wise or character-wise. LA VERY much enjoyed this second season for this, let alone giving LA some great characters like Mikoto Yamato, Haruhime and heck even Liliruca gets heavily redeemed in this second season. With the Apollo and Ishtar familia&#039;s craziness dust settling...what DOES Freya want with Bell, either way this second season was great and is an absolute must for those fans who liked the first season, was a palette cleanser from the disappointment of  Sword Oratoria and then some for the Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka world..and since it was announced there will be a third season, LA wouldn&#039;t mind them trying to blend both the dungeoneering aspect of the firsts season and the Familia Wars of this season together making this world building fleshed out even more and let&#039;s not forget the major plot twist with Bell and what this has to do with Freya.<br />
<br />
Hestia may be Bestia but she&#039;s getting competition...from Haruhime and Freya...

    It’s been a while since Danmachi has enjoyed the volatile attention of the anime community, so much so that I wouldn’t recommend jumping into Season 2 with only a passive recollection of the events or world set up by the previous season...frankly, to passive viewers of this show, I wouldn’t recommend jumping into Season 2 at all at its current stage. Danmachi sits at an interesting crossroads for a lot of people, it seems. On the one hand, it’s mired in so many narrative inconsistencies that the veritable onslaught of criticisms lobbed its way effectively chip at its armor. But on the other, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314405">
        often lauded as a treasure trove for guilty pleasure enthusiasts. However, I can’t say my loyalties exactly align with either camp to a T. It’s difficult to frame a review around this series in particular, because it’s the source of an ongoing headache of conflicting feelings for me. <br />
<br />
My biggest problem with Danmachi is the identity crisis presented by its content. Is this a stupid show that’s well aware of its faults yet wants to be taken seriously? Or is this a flawed show that wants to be viewed as dumb fun? I can’t parse with that level of minutiae. It’s infuriating. And if these first 4 episodes are any indication of what’s to come, Danmachi has mostly stayed consistent in its ability to somehow comfortably inhabit this middle ground. This is the same old Danmachi, and if that’s exactly what you want, more power to you. <br />
<br />
This season is not looking to impress an audience that wasn’t there to begin with, this is quite literally the same old Danmachi. However, in its insistence to give the audience what they want (which is more of the same), the conflict feels safe at best and the pacing of its plot progression has screeched to an ironic halt. The pacing of these first 4 episodes is break-neck, however, because the overarching plot is so stagnated, it feels like watching an elongated B-story in place of receiving any form of significant plot or character progression. The set-up for the conflict between Hestia and Apollo’s factions could have made for an intriguing story arc, but that potential is disappointingly squandered by the second episode. <br />
<br />
The first red flag came in the form of a D-tier clairvoyant character essentially spelling out how this arc is going to end with about as much subtlety as a hammer to the face. Even if I tempered my expectations of the heroes proudly bearing their victory scars, it doesn’t exactly mitigate the fact that even the bystander characters have become self-aware to the predictability of the conflict unfolding before them. I can budge on the predictability of Danmachi being a non-criticism, with these kinds of shows, you get what you pay for. Therein lies the issue, despite it almost being self-aware in its predictability, heavy use of tropes, and unnecessary fan-service, Danmachi tries way too hard to play it with a straight face. <br />
<br />
I’d like to coin this phenomenon “Fairy Tail syndrome”, wherein which a show with needlessly campy assets attempts to inject seriousness into its narrative, making for a final product that feels tonally dissonant. There’s a particularly egregious moment in the second episode between Bell and Hestia in a sewer. I’ll keep it vague for the sake of people interested in this second season, to provide some context, before this scene occurs, there is a relatively “tense” action sequence, but to cut at the tension, there is an amorous comedic bit between Bell and Hestia that thoroughly undercuts the tension. Not only that, but there is a serious lack of needed tension in the forced romantic relationship between the two that any interaction between them feels like an utter waste of screentime. Any time this show tries to get serious about the romantic interaction between any of the love interests and Bell, it comes off as tasteless harem antics with indulgent and predictable fan-service situations. And it’s never funny. <br />
<br />
I enjoy this series to an extent, and I can come to terms with its mass appeal. I have a soft spot for shows about underdog dorks slowly inching their way to momentary success, even if it requires some suspension of disbelief when those small victories feel heavily contrived. Even if it is a predictable formula to pace into, it’s hard to not raise an eyebrow when characters manage to best annoyingly pompous antagonists. Hestia is indeed “Bestia”, or at least her extremely iconic design and charming personality facilitates enough anime-tiddy Twitter-feed fodder to convince me otherwise. Her rapport with Bell almost occasionally convinces me that I’m not watching a show about a woman who’s fallen madly in love with a dungeon diving slice of Wonder Bread slathered in Miracle Whip.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, Danmachi has a pretty colorful cast of them. I can’t speak much for Bell Cranel, as protagonists go he’s pushed so far into the corner of typical harem anime protagonists that he just sort of bleeds into the mix with the rest of them. There’s nothing engaging about his backstory to latch onto and his disingenuous underdog act produces many an eye-roll worthy moment when he “miraculously” comes out on top. Hestia is the mascot, rightfully so because she’s just that charming of a character. Inori Minase is THE cute anime girl voice and provides a needed dose of energy in the sluggish pace of this show’s story. Some people find her annoying but her character reminds me that this show’s concept could’ve worked had they played to the comedic aspect a little more. Think Urusei Yatsura except with a Dungeons and Dragons type setting. Her design also bothers some people for the excessive sexualizing of her character but fan-service has never bothered me TOO much especially if it’s in a show that’s fully committed to exploiting it to a satirical degree. However, Danmachi doesn’t seem fully committed to that tone so whenever there are egregious body/POV shots of her character model, it can take away from the seriousness of the tone of a scene or distract from the dialogue. <br />
<br />
Besides the main protagonists, the secondary and tertiary characters have distinct enough personalities and designs to at least stick with you on a shallow level, so it doesn’t just feel like they’re there to populate the world. However, the story never lingers on any one character long enough for them to feel fully realized. Lily’s backstory is further explored in this season and it should be noted that she’s probably the only character in the previous season (besides Bell) that got significant attention. However, after her storyline felt mostly tied up in the previous season, it didn’t seem to me like there was much else to do with her character, so when the story eventually did shift its attention to her it just felt like extraneous BS. <br />
<br />
With tonal dissonance, shallow characters, forced comedy, predictability, and a stagnated plot taking the forefront can Danmachi Season 2 at least bring up the rear on a technical level in its first 4 episodes? Despite pretty standard direction, Danmachi is at least consistent in its animation. There are no set-pieces that stand out to me as far as key animation, and even the change in director didn’t exactly do so much as to change the shot composition slightly, but on average the show is passable enough to distract from its pretty inert direction. I also think Danmachi sports some pretty good character designs despite the overall look of the characters being relatively simple. <br />
<br />
Danmachi can’t seem to compromise with its tone. It’s still not quite at the point of no return however as it continues to march to the beat of its own drum, it seems perfectly content in staying in its lane. There are aspects of this show that I like and at some point, I’m sure it will be able to actually rise to the challenge of weaving together a subversive or effectual story arc, but as of this first handful of episodes, that still might be far off on the horizon. There’s a part of my subconscious that just wants to press its finger against my lips and silently whisper, “shut up, don’t think about it too much”, but that’s asking too much. <br />

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />

2015 was certainly an interesting year. The SCOTUS legalized gay marriage, Subway&#039;s Jared got exposed for being a pedophile, and DanMachi was about dungeons. Now, in 2019, DanMachi is not about dungeons. DanMachi is now about fanservice and whatever the fuck happened in the first four episodes.<br />
<br />
The first arc of this season is so unbelievably bad that it left me dumbfounded as to what I just watched. The main antagonist of the arc decides that he wants Bell for himself, so now they are in a War Game. Ignoring the comically stupid motivations of the main antagonist, this almost sounds cool, doesn&#039;t it? Except

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315534">
        there are three episodes of setup and one episode of War Game. Genius pacing right there! Thanks, J.C.Staff.<br />
<br />
Those three setup episodes are already mind-numbingly unentertaining, but the real criminal here is episode four. In the War Game, Hestia&#039;s familia has 5 combatants, while Apollo has like 100+. But hey, who cares! Everyone in Hestia&#039;s familia can take on dozens of Apollo&#039;s fighters singlehandedly. This might make sense for Ryu, who is a much higher level adventurer than everyone else. What doesn&#039;t make sense is Welf and Mikoto being able to beat dozens of adventurers of the same level as them with literally one attack. &quot;Oh, but Mikoto has an OP spell! Oh, but Welf has an OP magic sword!&quot; Genius writing right there, right? Is this DanMachi or Arifureta?<br />
<br />
That&#039;s not even the worst part of what is certainly one of the worst anime episodes ever created. The worst part comes in when Bell fights Apollo&#039;s commander man. That guy beat Bell to a pulp with his bare hands a couple of episodes ago, but now, Bell can beat him easily. Why? He trained pretty much offscreen for a couple of episodes! That makes him comically OP! So comically OP, in fact, that he literally beat the guy with a kick and a punch. This juvenile writing is so atrocious that it is unbelievable that this is a sequel to DanMachi, considering its first season was actually quite good.<br />
<br />
After whatever the fuck happened in those four atrocious episodes, we get two fanservice eps in a row. I honestly thought I was watching KonoSuba at this point, but no, I&#039;m pretty sure the people responsible for this pile of shit expect me to take this season seriously. Episode 5 is slice of life with a bath scene. Episode 6 is Bell hanging out with a bunch of prostitutes. Fun! I don&#039;t have a problem with fanservice in itself; but when there is no substance whatsoever behind the fanservice, that&#039;s annoying. I remember when Bell was fighting a minotaur in season one. Can we bring that back? That was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
From protagonists becoming comically OP despite doing nothing to deserve it, to the absurd amount of big tiddies, this season feels like some 12-year-old&#039;s power trip. If you want big tiddies, go watch HDxD or something. There are plenty of way better fanservice shows. If you want good fight scenes, you won&#039;t find them here, because the animators seem to have a stroke every other fight scene. As such, there is literally nothing redeeming here, unless you like shitty fight scenes and mediocre fanservice. J.C.Staff already ruined DAL and Index, and here&#039;s the latest victim of their never-ending spree of destroying beloved franchises.

    So far, I feel like this season is being rushed. And when I say that, I mean REALLY rushed. Take the first arc of the series for example: The Apollo/War-Game Arc. The starting episodes were fine and all but it eventually delved down into lazy writing, awkward plotting and everything just being rushed to the point that the whole of the War-Game only took up one episode. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, the B.S power boost Bell received within that short amount of time, it&#039;s not even funny anymore. You expect us to believe that just within a couple of days. He was already curb-stomping over the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314820">
        same guy who beat the ever living shit out of him the days prior? This is what I like to call: &quot;A Toriyama Hand-Job&quot;. It&#039;s where just because the plot oh-so demands it. The protagonist gets so strong to the point where the word bullshit is literally written into the script itself. <br />
<br />
If i were to compare Bell&#039;s increase in power level, it&#039;s like how Goku during the Namek Saga went from a power level of: 90,000 to fucking 3,000,000 just because he got a &quot;Zenkai Boost&quot;. But hey, at least there&#039;s an explanation to how Goku got this strong, even though it&#039;s extremely vague. <br />
<br />
For Bell in season 2, they don&#039;t fucking explain anything at all! They just expect us to accept the amount of shit they pull out of their ass and consider it as &quot;Simply a power boost&quot; or &quot;The character worked hard for it.&quot; It would have been much more believable if they showed us an actual TRAINING segment instead of a few frames of maybe him dodging one or two hits from Wallenstein. The whole thing is fucking wonky.<br />
<br />
This series was one of my favorites when it first came out with it&#039;s first season. It was a great newbie turning pro story and I was always excited for what to come next but now it&#039;s like the producers are taking the piss.

    This show is average and such a parody of the first season and the genre that I do not recommend watching this show. <br />
<br />
Even though it has been a few years I before watching this second season I remembered all of the good that the first season did. It was nothing entirely original and the familia premise was nice but what made the first season so enjoyable because it was a well executed underdog story of Bell Cranel getting stronger with a few passable ecchi scenes. <br />
<br />
However, season two does not capture that same enjoyment simply because it&#039;s execution and direction was not on par

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315399">
        with the first season. <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10 <br />
The story continues on from the first season about Bell trying to get stronger and find more girls in dungeons and without spoiling, he does get into trouble. However, it is not the sort of trouble that gets the watchers tense or explores a theme of the show it is simply a poorly executed conflict that had barely any interesting qualities. From the minotaur scene and early dungeon scenes from the first season, this season does not capture the same heart. It feels like a slice of life fantasy like Konnosuba rather than an action adventure series.  <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 <br />
One of the best qualities of DanMachi was that it always had nice art and animation. While it isn&#039;t anything top tier, it is still enjoyable to look at. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10  <br />
The opening and endings are good again nothing special but they do their jobs the same as the OSTs. <br />
<br />
Characters: 5/10 <br />
The characters in this anime are so average. One of the bigger themes of this anime is Bell gaining more experience and strength. He moves from his humble beginnings as the Little Rookie into a more accomplished adventurer however there is literally nothing interesting about him. He is plain and average and he along with the rest of the anime are completely filled with tropes. No other character in this anime feels even remotely interesting. Lili-kun is probably the only one with the interesting story but they executed in such a boring manner that all of her intrigue quickly dissipated. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10 <br />
This season is completely average and missable It does not capture the same charm as the first season did and feels more like a parody of itself and the genre similarly to Konosuba except DanMachi attempts to take itself seriously.  <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10 <br />
Again, I do not recommend watching this show. It is average with very little redeeming qualities. If you want to watch something in a similar type of world then I suggest watching Konosuba. It&#039;s a comedy that knows it&#039;s a comedy and it executes it impeccably.

    WARNING: CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS<br />
<br />
After the disaster that was One Punch Man season 2, J.C. Staff has proven itself to not learn from their mistakes and destroy yet another great show.<br />
<br />
Story - 2<br />
<br />
Danmacci season 2 has 2 story arcs so far. One involves the war game with the Apollo family and the other is about saving Haruhime (and i guess all of Orario) from the Ishtar family. Now personally, I don&#039;t mind the fact that there are 2 separate arcs in a 12 episode season, however I do mind the fact that they are both executed extremely poorly. The story is that the Apollo family wants

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316731">
        to take Bell away from Hestia and declare a war game to do so (after creating havoc in the city). From what the setting tells us about the characters is that they are all fairly intelligent under a capitalistic economic structure and governed by appropriate laws. So when the Apollo family decides to attack the Hestia family and disrupt the peace of the city, how are they not convicted of any crimes? This is a major plot hole that completely disregards any meaning to the setting and its characters. On top of that, Apollo&#039;s reason for wanting Bell in the first place was by no means worth sacrificing all his property and money. This is the prime example of plot convenience. <br />
<br />
As of episode 8 in the Ishtar arc, the story is just downright an eyesore. Haruhime is a princess from the far east that got taken into custody by the Ishtar family and forced to work as a prostitute, however, she holds a secret ability that makes her extremely useful in aiding in battle. Bell and the familia want to save Haruhime from being abused constantly by the Ishtars so they decide to buy her when they have enough money. Now you&#039;d think the story is just a rescue mission, when reality it&#039;s just a horrorful reverse rape fetish. In one scene, Bell gets his genitals grabbed by an ugly woman which shows how a decent show went from being a fantasy genre anime into a tragic hentai. I will go into more detailed criticism about the Istar familia in the characters portion.<br />
<br />
Sound and Art - 6<br />
<br />
Nothing much to tell here. The animations and aesthetics are fairly decent.<br />
<br />
Characters - 1<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I liked Danmacci season 1 was because of how the characters develop throughout the show. For example, Lilith overcame her fear of her previous family after sucking up to them for most her life. In Danmacci season 2, there has been absolutely no character development whatsover so far in the show and every single character is unengaging. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons season 1 is good is because of Hestia&#039;s child-like personality. In season 2 however, there is a complete lack of Hestia and it&#039;s almost as if she&#039;s a side character especially in the Ishtar arc.<br />
<br />
For the members of the Apollo family, each and every one of them only say lines like &quot;come with me Bell, or suffer.&quot; It is honestly just painful to hear every time and they have no development at all for the main antagonists of the arc. <br />
<br />
As for each and every member of the Ishtar clan, they are all a complete eyesore to look at as Iv&#039;e mentioned before. One of the main problems i noticed early on with these characters is that they&#039;re all prostitutes yet they want the lay with Bell for free. This is a complete contradiction to what these characters should really be. As for the fat and ugly Ishtar specifically, she went from being a funny character that jokes about how she &quot;gets all the guys&quot; to being a psychotic rape dungeon torture maniac in the blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Now Bell in this season is a pea brain who doesn&#039;t understand half of what is happening around him which completely contradicts his character from the first season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3 <br />
<br />
There is no denying that the aesthetics and battle in the war game were good to look at so i&#039;ll give it a 3 for that one episode.<br />
<br />
Overall- 2<br />
<br />
Now it may seem like I just sound butt-hurt and immature about all the Ishtar family scenes, however, that is not so as this is supposed to be a fantasy genre anime about a group of people who explore a dungeon and kill monsters. The turn of events make absolutely no sense towards the setting. <br />
<br />
Now that that&#039;s out of the way, Danmacci doesn&#039;t succeed because they fail to make the characters engaging by provide 0 character development and dreadful story arcs.

    do you like fantasy? fighting monsters? mythology? a little gaming mechanism (actually there are none)? Then this one is my recommendation.<br />
The only thing people think that this anime has game mechanism is about the level concept, while in my opinion level concept is exist in real world such as having work skills license. So it&#039;s not really a game mechanism.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
I always love this anime. A heroic tale with many conflict, building up power to be stronger, a naive mindset of the MC. If you love the first season, then you&#039;ll love this too.<br />
This anime also has a really good battle scene, unlike some &quot;isekai&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317317">
        genere anime, the battle scene was executed so good that moves me. I still remember the minotaur fight scene in the season 1, God that was really a heroic fight.<br />
Also, if you like Greek mythology or Nordic mythology, this anime has BOTH! God, i really love this show.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
This is purely based on my opinion, everyone has different taste. But, i think this anime has really good art compared to another anime. The art is consistent, i just find it really beautiful, especially about Haruhime.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Good enough, no stupid bgm. The BGM fits with the scene.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
I really like Belt character. He is a naive person but not dumb. In this arc, he is confronted with a contradicting problem. Should he saves a &quot;slut&quot; which is a symbol of destruction of a hero, or should he leave her alone so that his familia won&#039;t get any trouble because his childish mindset.<br />
He is my favorite character after Emiya Shiro (Heaven&#039;s Feel route). They both SIMILAR!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Honestly i can&#039;t enjoy anime as much as it was. Mostly i only watch 2 animes each season and drop the others. But i really enjoy this one, seriously.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
if you like fantasy story, heroic story, good battle scene, just watch this.

    After watching the first season, I thought that the name of this anime doesn&#039;t mean anything. This is a story of a boy who becomes a hero from zero. The first season was amazing. The plot told us that there was a goddess who targeted the protagonist and was helping him grow strong. We didn&#039;t know what was the real target of that goddess. The plot of Gods and Goddess coming to earth to live with humans by abandoning all their powers was also not that good but I accepted it somehow. The fighting with plot was the thing that everyone loved and so was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317128">
        me. So after all that, it made me want to wait and watch the second season.<br />
<br />
The second season made gods and goddess seem like nothing more than humans. Yes, HUMANS! &quot;Why would Gods fight among themselves?&quot;, I wondered. It seems Gods in this anime is nothing more than trash humans. Then the skills are also trash now. Our protagonist has emotion freezing ability but what about it? His emotion still exist like others and &quot;Fire Bolt&quot; seems more like a low-level attack unlike the first season. All the adventurer seems like otakus with no power but high-level attitude. Then there&#039;s the main antagonist of this season and her &quot;Familia&quot;. The main antagonist is a &quot;SLUT GOD&quot;. Funny, right? Well, it is. The strongest warrior in her Familia is a fat old lady. The whole familia owns a &quot;Slut Town&quot; and for some unknown reason, they are the second strongest familia. That&#039;s what our author decided. There are no ACTUAL FIGHTS here. I believe writer was trying to come up with a hentai plot like Rance 01 but with no actual hentai scenes.<br />
<br />
The sound is kind of annoying. Specially when a explosion or &quot;Fire Bolt&quot; releases. The Sound is like a &quot;EAR-RAPE&quot; Version of grenade explosion. There is no side character stories. Even if there is, it&#039;s all meaningless ones. The art is all that&#039;s good in this anime.<br />
<br />
I suggest that you do not watch this anime AT ALL. You can watch the first season but not this one. Don&#039;t make yourself waste time on this anime. Watch something better. Watch even Fairy Tail, but not this one. That&#039;s how I feel after watching this anime.

    Please, don&#039;t waste your time<br />
Danmachi sure did entertained me with the first season, I wasn&#039;t expecting much from the second season... But I was expecting something that is possible to my eyes and brain to watch, at least. What the actual f**k is this anime? <br />
I simply cannot stand watching this anymore<br />
It&#039;s unbeliavable how people spent money to animate and direct this.<br />
The story built is actually nice and fun if you think about it, the little rookie has something unique in him, that can make him stronger and level up easily, specially in hard times that he is forced to push himself to his limits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316171">
        in order to protect the ones he loves, quite the cliché, but these kinds of plot usually don&#039;t fail to draw attention from any public. The animation is quite smooth, but it&#039;s hardly shown on this sequel, they really show how their budget was low, it comes to the point where action scenes are presented with just a slide of still images, there&#039;s also scenes which some of the side-characters stay still while there is movement going on. The thing is, there are animes with lower budgets that are better animated than this.<br />
The characters ? Easily replaceable <br />
The protagonist is just a common &quot;nut size brain&quot; that can&#039;t think by himself and it&#039;s a completely moron around womens. (This last part is very common, and it&#039;s what piss me the most) Like, why does this characters have to be so empty ? I&#039;m tired of this protagonist format, weak on the beggining, gets stronger, but is still idiot like he doesn&#039;t have a brain, and even dumber around women.<br />
This echi anime type it&#039;s just a cancer, I really think you get dumber as you watch<br />
The sound effects of this is just appaling, there are lots of time where they didn&#039;t even bother to add the characters steps sounds <br />
Sorry if you were looking for something more technical, but this anime is not worthy of such thing<br />
Aaand, the story is soooooooooooooo fking rushed

    A somewhat promising show that took its potential and threw it into the fire like SAO did. A disappointment, to say the least.<br />
<br />
When I first watched Danmachi&#039;s first season, despite its clichés and overly used character archetypes and plot, I enjoyed every bit of it, watching every episode with joy and excitement. Watching a young boy grow stronger and chase after the woman he loved sparked lots of nostalgia in me. When second season was announced, I was excited beyond belief, even watching the premiere at AX.<br />
<br />
So where in this second season did things go wrong?<br />
<br />
If we look at a show like One Punch Man

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318636">
        and it&#039;s second season, we can get a good grasp at just what happened that caused the second season to be unable to live up to the expectations of the first. One trait that OPM had in its first season was this feeling of exhilaration in every action scene. This feeling would excite the viewers, bringing watchers closer into the action and movements of the characters and just how epic the show was. Danmachi 1 was similar in many ways as there were many scenes in which I and many others watched in awe as Bell Cranel fought with great passion to overcome many obstacles. But sadly, second season didn&#039;t have that.<br />
<br />
One of the main issues why I couldn&#039;t properly watch this show and savor feelings of exhilaration was due to the quick pacing. Often times scenes could have been lengthened out, giving them more meaning and purpose. Like the tortoise and the hare, it is often much better to take your time than to speed through, and that&#039;s exactly what Danmachi 2 failed at. Everything felt rushed and unnatural, nothing like an adventure. One moment Bell got caught in a fight against the Apollo familia, and the next moment, victory against the Apollo familia in the war game. A fight scene that could have been lengthened out and given great detail such as the Minotaur fight in season 1 ended before you could even think about it. There was just no feelings put into the show.<br />
<br />
Season 2 was also supposed to be a break from the dungeoning aspect of season 1 and focus more on the relationships between the gods and familias of Orario, but instead we got nothing but 2 gods who were nuts over Bell. Little to no details about the gods were given, and in an attempt to create a show that squeezed in two highly anticipated arcs we ended up with a confusing plot with nothing but creepy Apollo faces and a sprinkle of fan service because why not, it&#039;ll get you some views. For a show that stresses the importance of relationships between gods and the mortals of the world, it felt like nothing but a tournament to see who could take Bell&#039;s virginity first. Once the 2 major arcs were completed, the whole story took a downfall, and decided to end the series with 2 filler episodes that failed to do anything but worsen the reputation of the show, as I couldn&#039;t help but watch them feeling as if the studio had just completely given up on the project after they noticed it was paced way too fast and failed to achieve it&#039;s expectations of a epic and exhilarating show. <br />
<br />
The overall sound stayed consistent throughout the show, which was one of season 1&#039;s strong points. However, the art took a serious hit towards the end of the second arc, with many scenes feeling very rushed and, not surprisingly, bad CGI. This only worsened the feeling that the studio had given up on the second season due to how poorly it was paced.  <br />
<br />
Of course, the show had some of it&#039;s strong points that kept the whole show from being a complete disaster. As aforementioned, it was nice to take a break from the dungeoning aspect of Bell&#039;s life and more towards the relationships and rivalries between the gods of Tenkai. Danmachi was introduced as a show of dungeons and gods, not just of the dungeons, so changing the subject of the show was definitely a positive towards the overall plot.<br />
<br />
Despite the possible positives to this show, it comes to no surprise that Danmachi 2 was unable to outdo or even match the prowess of the first season. Its unnatural pace and skipping of details that could have added more depth into the show caused the entire story and characters to fall apart. The overall show felt very flat and boring, as I could no longer feel this sense of motivation and energy that the first season initially had. To top it all off, the failure of the art to match the quality of its first couple episodes and the first season made it worse, as it became painful to watch a show that no longer seemed to have any effort put into it. With how poorly the show ended I was surprised to see that a 3rd season was announced, and despite having had great expectations to the 2nd season that was to cover 2 very exciting arc from the light novel series, I no longer feel a sense of excitement for the 3rd season, despite knowing just how amazing the following story arc are in the actual light novel series. Danmahi 1 set up a high level of potential which the second season managed to throw away by pacing the show too quickly and therefore making a very bland show. I am hoping that the 3rd season that will air in the future will fix the mistakes created in the 2nd season and bring back the sense of exhilaration and excitement that the first season gave in order to capture its audience.<br />

    I don&#039;t know about the others but since I&#039;ve read the light novel of it, I think they did decent in DanMachi season 2. Been waiting for Haruhime for a long time and now that it&#039;s here, I am looking forward to this Ishtar Familia incident. The execution left out some details from the light novel which probably the reason why Bell became too strong for Apollo Familia. After he underwent training with Ais and Tione, Bell&#039;s status became all SS aside from his agility. When Hestia was asked by Hermes why and what is the status of Bell&#039;s agility, she just replied with a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316590">
        smirk on her face telling him that it is beyond SS and that is thanks to his skill. And now as we are on the way to the end of the arc, we are introduced to many new good characters like Aisha and Haruhime. To avoid further spoiling the fun, these two characters did have a lot of impact on Bell Cranel&#039;s character development. Does a prostitute deserves the help of a hero in the making as it is known that in heroic tales, prostitutes are some of the reasons for the hero&#039;s downfall. Is Bell Cranel willing to do and break through his walls just to save Haruhime in the hands of the Ishtar Familia? <br />
Best Characters still in the series is Hermes and Aisha, that&#039;s for sure.

    It is fair to say that I am one of those critics that had no big problem with DanMachi when it first aired in 2015. It was flawed, no doubt, but it was a harmless, fun adventure show that brought about one of the greatest waifu-bait cuties ever to grace the medium; and I will hear no denying that sentiment from here on out! <br />
<br />
After nearly five years, we finally get more of DanMachi to continue the story of our two favorite lovable companions going on more adventures and meet new characters on the way. If you remember my review of the previous season, you&#039;d

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320645">
        see that I gave it a solid score considering the type of anime that it is: Harem anime with a dim-witted protagonist. However, Bell is a dim-witted protagonist that at least has some heart to him and especially with his interactions with the boob goddess herself, Hestia. That was what made DanMachi a lot better than most of its similar contemporaries. My one big wish for the sequel was to expand on their relationship more and have it be a more significant focus on the narrative.<br />
<br />
What I did get was more of that, but not enough. The reason I wanted more of it was that everyone else outside of Hestia and Bell&#039;s relationship is merely decent to just downright dull. None of the other female characters have anything to them that makes them stand out or memorable in the slightest. Lili is the only one other than Hestia that has any semblance of charisma only because she does become more integral to Bell&#039;s story, and she does have her fair share of funny moments sprinkled throughout the show. Every other character, I could not put my finger on what I&#039;m supposed to latch to. Their personal story arcs aren&#039;t exactly anything special or become downright melodramatic to the point where it gets nauseating the more I try to think about it. I would not classify them as terrible characters from a moral or writing standpoint, its just that the sequel did not do much to carry me through whatever struggle or situation they happen to be in.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that Hestia does draw some ire among the anime community. A lot will point out how annoying she can be whenever she tries her best to cling on to Bell whenever she has the opportunity to do so. There have been other characters like Hestia that did strike me as annoying to the point where I didn&#039;t want to sit through whatever tedious antics they conjure up. With Hestia, I find that what made her special was her eye-catching design and her bright personality that shines through Minase Inori&#039;s fantastic performance. Would I say that Inori could only play Hestia? Probably not. But, I think she sells this character with her much needed charisma that makes Hestia&#039;s advances more charming than anything else.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve said before that DanMachi&#039;s plot is nothing special. I would say it&#039;s not very good in many aspects. Many times I often forget what the main overarching story is supposed to be other than, &quot;Main character and companion go on RPG adventures A, B, and C.&quot; There isn&#039;t much to it other than that. The sequel does try its best to give us plot arcs that jump up the melodrama to try to tug at your heartstrings a little. I don&#039;t think it was very successful as it felt a bit contrived once I thought about it. The one thing I will give credit for the 2nd half of the season was that it gave us a familia that is mainly populated by bikini clothed girls. So if you weren&#039;t already turned off by the boob goddess sulking up the screen by her gelatinous milk jugs, you will not be swayed by this season by a long shot. For me, I appreciated the gesture, even if the plot itself wasn&#039;t very memorable.<br />
<br />
The animation quality is about the same as season one. Thankfully. We have been getting a lot of lousy studio changes in other anime that switch up the animation or character designs that make it jarring to go back and forth to. J.C. Staff usually never disappoints to give quality art and animation direction consistently even if it isn&#039;t spellbinding like most other big-budget anime studios.<br />
<br />
DanMachi is one of those anime that I always stick up for regardless of its many detractors. However, it is one of those situations where I can not argue why those people have their issues. It is dumb in its execution to be a standout RPG/Fantasy anime in a time where there is already enough of those to the point of suffocation. Honestly, without the relationship between Bell and Hestia, I do think I would be on that side of the camp. Regardless, anyone who says anything about Hestia is just wrong in every sense of the word. Just stop. Please? Thank you.

~Spoiler Free Review~<br />
<br />
DanMachi, the anime that took the world by storm in 2015, is back again to pick up where we last left off in season 1. There has been a lot of hype for season 2, and everyone has been excited to join Bell and his adventures again... or so we thought. This anime so far has been very lackluster in living up to its name that was presented back in 2015. It&#039;s disappointing how far this anime has fallen from its position, but by no means is this anime bad. There are quite big problems with this season,

        and when it messes up, it messes up big time. Thankfully, there aren&#039;t that many problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
Rushed. That is all I can say, it ruins the story arcs. The first arc started good, and when we got to the meat of the story, the anime took off in a full olympic sprint. Literally no time was spend to develop the characters or the story, its a shame because this arc was a good starting point for S2. Even without reading the source material I know that content is being skipped and cut out by large amounts, and that&#039;s a bad sign. <br />
The second arc is dark, and I mean really dark. It deals with topics like prostitution, kidnapping, rape, drugging, and torture (specifically episode 8). I don&#039;t understand why the writers chose to put these topics into a PG-13 anime, because these are the kinds of stuff you find in those really messed up doujins that people warn you about. To be fair, it is watered down and we don&#039;t actually see anything or go into specifics, but its still really bad to put these kinds of things into a story like DanMachi. Prostitution alone was already pushing it. It really makes me question what the writers were doing after they finished writing the events of S1, because the story there was pretty good and very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Oh and one plot hole that drives me crazy is how the second story arc takes place in a huge district in Orario that literally came out of thin air. Quite a few times we have seen overhead, semi-panoramic shots of the city of Orario, NO WHERE IN THESE SHOTS CAN I FIND THE PLEASURE QUARTER. They even provide us with an overhead shot of what the Pleasure Quarter looks like, and nothing matches. They literally did not think the city through when they created the overhead scenes of Orario back in S1. The damn district appears to be half the size of Orario for god&#039;s sake. Where did this place come from?!?!<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Its good, but nothing amazing. Mainly because we have almost no action scenes compared to S1. It&#039;s a nice anime to look at, but its mostly still shots with animated characters. 70% of the time we are looking at buildings, which isn&#039;t exactly hard to animate.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Its nice, there&#039;s lots of ambiance in this season and I like it. Nothing short of S1 honestly, in the small amount of action scenes we get, the music is fitting. In each different atmosphere as we progress through the story, the music is very fitting and helps you jump into the scene.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
Character development is a tad bit better than the story, but also suffers from the same problem. We are running through the arcs so fast we don&#039;t get to watch the characters grow. Things are just happening and we have to move on because the next sequence started. Compared to S1, there&#039;s almost no character development, though there is a fair amount of character interaction which I like.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
I was so hyped for this anime, and I was so disappointed after episode 2. It started off great, and is progressing pretty badly. I lost almost all my excitement for this anime as of episode 8, the dark undertones finished it for me. I&#039;m still going to keep watching, after all I like DanMachi for what it is, even if S2 has been beaten to a pulp. I still want to see Bell grow and the main storyline progress, even if i&#039;m getting my hopes up since there is only 4/5 more episodes left.<br />
<br />
(Updated section after completing all episodes)<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: Season 2 was surely a disappointment compared to season 1. Did I like DanMachi in the end? Yes. Am I conflicted on this season? Yeah. DanMachi took a full 180 turn with this season, it became very mellow and almost trying to be a drama yet failing at being so. There&#039;s a lot of parts lacking in this season that we saw and loved in S1, it&#039;s a shame that this adaptation came out as poorly as it did. This season is very inconsistent, almost not even feeling like a sequel to S1 at all. Character dynamics are off, the story telling is strange, and most importantly the characters feel empty. <br />
As many people are also saying, the two major story arcs were apparently very very badly adapted from their source material. The first arc was supposed to be a huge turning point in the DanMachi story and was also much longer than they put screen time to, its a shame to hear that honestly. A lot of people praise the first arc of S2 in the LN and I heard many good things about it, and yet it came out so poorly in the anime, its a shame really. I will be going off to read the LN to not only relive the story but to also prepare myself for S3. <br />
<br />
I liked the anime regardless, its not terrible, but this season definitely did not live up to its reputation. I have high hopes for S3, as we are going to see what everyone is saying is the best story arc of DanMachi. Off to the LN~

    I can&#039;t say I&#039;m disappointed, because I really enjoyed this 2nd season, however, the story took a turn I wasn&#039;t really expecting. Instead of focusing on the (supposedly) main theme of the series, which is Bell and his adventures in the dungeon, while he levels up and becomes stronger, they chose to put everything along those lines in 3rd plan and focus on the story. It&#039;s not bad in my opinion, however, I was expecting more badass dungeon fighting scenes. Just to clarify, among all the 12 episodes, if I&#039;m not mistaken, there were only 3 or 4 dungeon fight scenes, and none was even

    Danmachi season 2 is not the best out there but it is sure to give entertainment and positive vibes on you especially when you appreciate it in comparison to the first season.<br />
<br />
I gave it a decent score because the story has developed much. First, having reasonable conflicts with the other gods, which introduced many more characters within the realm or danmachiverse. It&#039;s also great to see that the main familia of our story had expanded even a little. Second, is the physical and mental development of the protagonists. Some leveled up, and most of them became more courageous in fighting with those who do evil

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318797">
        things and in standing up for their comrades. Third, there was a big chance that the main villain was revealed and there is now something to look forward to in the next seasons, unlike in the first season, it&#039;s just like adventures and nothing to look forward to. Lastly, we know that we all want ships and the ships are sailing little by little. Surprisingly, the ships are multiplying! <br />
<br />
The downside, however, is that every arc is seemed to be a bit rushed. That is understandable because there are only 12 episodes given to us for this season. Even though it turned out like that, the story was understandable with a good animation to portray every scene wonderfully - that&#039;s what&#039;s important. <br />
<br />
All in all, it was very good! A simple anime, that is not that hyped and not that displeasing, gave a splendid continuation to the adventures of Bell Cranel and Hestia together with the whole familia. More meaningful events had occurred that conveyed good life lessons and love for friends.

    DanMachi season 2 feels like it&#039;s already been experienced. The story starts some time  after where season 1 ended and characters have since gained some strength for the upcoming challenges to come and with that giving less screen time for the actual dungeoncrawling, which is good since this seasons point isn&#039;t to become strong, it&#039;s being able to stand up to the challenges that have fallen on Bell due to his fast growth.<br />
<br />
We see a lot of conflict between familias compared to what we saw in season 1. This gives highlight to other &quot;rival&quot; characters to come and expand our known power policies in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318587">
        the world of Orario itself. The Gods itself have more role in this season than the last where they were just kinda sitting back and just cheering their familias on, but now there is competition and strategy to try to win more area and money to expand the familia and rise in power. As in terms of individuals Hermes is the most interesting one to step up in this season and not just as a quirky player, but as a calm and sharp minded person, plotting behind the scenes.<br />
     <br />
Still it seems like the points have already been seen, and struggles to find the fresh and adventurous feel like the first season did. Yea Hestia is still in love with Bell and keeps forgetting some obvious things and get in trouble for it, yeah Bell is still a virgin that is throughoutly helpless to talk to girls and shit, but yet it still doesn&#039;t have the same energy nor the ring to it that made the first season enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall this season didn&#039;t quite reach the levels to be a fun and enjoyable watch and dropped to leave a mediocre impression that left me a bit dissappointed.

    Trying to get my point across without spoiling anything.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve enjoyed the first season quite alot and the beginning of the second season but there is things about it I quite frankly can&#039;t let go. The main part is about the characters and their development. Bell Cranel. He does not change at all, through out the whole story and that is something that is annoying. It feels forced the way he acts for the story to progress and it gets tiring after awhile. That&#039;s mainly my biggest grudge and why I get angry watching it because it&#039;s easy to see how the story progresses but it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316669">
        not enjoyable if it&#039;s the same indecisive character having the same dilemma all the time. The first season was him overcoming himself and not being scared anymore but it feels like he has gone back to the start. If you have seen up to episode 8 you might understand what I mean.<br />
<br />
Except my rant about character development i&#039;ve enjoyed the art and the sound, the story has been alright but just that alot in there that could&#039;ve been better but its doable.
