    Being a fan of drama anime, especially ones that exemplify harsh realities of life in a real-world setting, I didn&#039;t think twice about giving this one a shot. Like Haibane Renmei (which I liked a lot) it deals with recollecting memories of one&#039;s past life and getting a shot at correcting the errors of the past. An unknown soul who commited a grave sin lined up, along with other souls in heaven, to receive his judgment inadvertently wins a lottery that gives him a second chance at life by doing an &quot;internship&quot; trial. A test that takes him back to earth and has to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38270">
        able to remember the grave sin he committed and be able to enjoy and live life again through the body of someone who recently committed suicide, 14-year old Makoto Kobayashi.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The plot&#039;s idea of the afterlife and another chance at life is quite amazing. Although it&#039;s not so new, it provides a more understandable view of second chances and acceptance of real life circumstances no matter how difficult it is to cope with. The movie doesn&#039;t fail to capture reality through the view of a seemingly normal yet troubled family and the eyes of their youngest, melancholic, junior high school son who experiences disasters one after the other pushing himself to do the worst thing. Character development in the movie shows another positive, particularly with the protagonist who has zero knowledge and idea on Makoto&#039;s circumstances yet tries to cope with it all despite how unsettling it is to live another person&#039;s life and adjust to a new, albeit indifferent and sometimes distasteful, environment. And Makoto, who really fell on hard times, deciding to end it all, whose life the protagonist must pick up where he left off. Being a a film in the drama genre, this movie didn&#039;t fail my expectations of one that really digs deep and touches the heart. <br />

Art/Animation: 9<br />
The art for Colorful looked really great and fitting for an anime movie. The CG background was beautifully drawn and given much detail and the characters are drawn well fitting each character&#039;s personality. Both Saotome and Shouko were really depicted as goofy and/or eccentric, two people who really get along well with the similarly strange Makoto whose former self is isolated from other people. Makoto&#039;s father looks as simple as he is an ordinary low-rank salaryman and his brother who is academically strong but socially indifferent especially to Makoto, fits the four-eyes, tall and brooding character. Makoto&#039;s mother really shows the deep and emotional yet motherly figure and Kuwabara, Makoto&#039;s crush is really pretty and takes advantage of it. The images of the city landscape were also breathtaking and the places portrayed definitely shows a realistic imagery.<br />
<br />
Music: 8<br />
Of course, the best part I liked with regards to the music is the ED theme &quot;Aozora&quot; sung by miwa (who, by the way, has that really clear, beautiful and emotional singing voice). Beautiful song that perfectly fits the story which is about going through and living life no matter the diversity of life&#039;s &quot;colors&quot; may put you through. Although most of the movie plays with little or no ambient background music. I can say fitting music is put in the right places where the emotions are most intense. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Overall, the movie definitely lived up to my expectations of a beautiful drama. Emotions are spot on, at times even, Makoto&#039;s character might get on your nerves because of his attitude despite his family&#039;s efforts to show their love and support but hey, as they say, everyone is fighting their own battles. Also, even with the fantasy theme of reincarnation it didn&#039;t fail to portray reality, its harshness, and the beauty of living life despite the former. Definitely something you can&#039;t miss especially if you love drama like me.

    Despite a wonderful opening sequence and captivating premise, Colorful turns out to be a mediocre disappointment that doesn&#039;t manage to attain much depth despite its attempts to do so.<br />
<br />
The film&#039;s main failure can be attributed to its lack of focus and scope, choosing to jump between several different characters that were related to the life of the protagonist. Whilst each of these characters and their inner conflicts had the potential to be very interesting upon exploration, the film never delves too deeply into any of them, choosing to take more of a touch and go approach, jumping from character to character, and developing none of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188029">
        them fully. It is due to this that it often feels as if there are jumps in characterization - most notably with relation to the crush of the protagonist, who is left forgotten by the film after a chilling and memorable scene, only to be brought back at the very end in what seems to be a very clumsy attempt to tie up loose ends. Much of the film feels that way - Despite it taking 2 hours, it doesn&#039;t really feel as if we really got to know the characters.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, the film can sometimes come across as preachy - it oftentimes lacks any subtlety at all. The message of the film is simple, about how us humans are often multifaceted and multicolored, how each of us have many different sides, and how each one of us are often suffering under our own burdens under the facades we put up. We are not alone in this world - your depression and sadness is not something that only you feel - but rather something that everyone goes through, and that we must push on and live life to the fullest even through sad times. It&#039;s a beautiful message indeed, but I personally don&#039;t feel that it is delivered well. Most of it is literally spoken out by the characters to the audience, most notably in the closing scene of the movie. It&#039;s a weak way to deliver a message, and it probably would have worked much better if the film found a way to show it more rather than simply preaching it in our faces.<br />
<br />
That said, the film does do some things well. For instance, the final twist, as predictable as it might be, works wonderfully for such a film, and would perhaps have been much more effective if the rest of the film had managed to develop a stronger emotional attachment to the protagonist. It&#039;s also beautifully animated and wonderfully drawn, making for a great visual experience at times. <br />
<br />
Overall, Colorful is a film that is perhaps brought down by the weight of its ambition. It tries to tackle a range of important issues and explore how we humans tick, but it never really delves deep into the characters and at most times only lightly touches on them. Jumps in characterization and relationships are probably the most problematic point within the film, and it simply doesn&#039;t make good use of its runtime.

    I myself have been particularly fond of anime that venture towards conveying an important message rather than predominantly focusing simply on mere entertainment as its driving force. By doing so you not only deliver an intellectual ambiance to your viewers but an inventive one as well.  For some this may appear too contemplative or be adding excess perplexity unnecessarily. Rather than enjoying this type of anime for mere amusement or pleasure, one should be prepared to learn a valuable lesson or two. By all means there is no urgent need for concern, since you will feel just as content and ecstatic with the conclusion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94761">
        as you indubitably would with any other distinguished anime. <br />
<br />
Story: The story has a cleverly mixed assortment of themes that are prevalent throughout the story.  You’ll find just as much optimism as you will pessimism, the outcome of events and development are erratic yet with a serene overtone theme. <br />
<br />
Straight from the onset our main character is utterly bewildered, he is neither deceased nor living. Believing to be in Nirvana(hope I’m correct on my wording there) he soon arrives face to face with a bizarre outspoken individual he surmises to be an angel. The “angel” instructs him that his soul is to replace that of another temporarily. The state of his new body’s situational status must be amended if he has any hope of returning to his former self. In addition to this, he is informed that the severity of his current results till then are a direct representation of the sin the he himself had committed. So he must amend a person’s life utterly foreign to him while simultaneously delving deep within himself for his own personal reconciliation. <br />
<br />
Along the way our protagonist will uncover several shocking revelations as he becomes desperate and resolute to succeed. Though this progress does not go without doubt and uncertainty in the process as he eventually loses confidence with his own capability at some stage. Even when he eventually becomes convinced that he’s now cognizant and in control of this seemingly futile enigma with all the answers to our protagonists abundant issues, he evidently couldn’t have been more mistaken. <br />
<br />
Characters:  As you steadily learn more about the characters you come to realize that they don’t consist of your typical archetypes. Colorful’s intriguing, exotic, and riveting set of characters are a perfect surreal personification of any commonplace individual in the real world today. We all have our own vile and appalling secrets that could dismantle our lives as we know it if uncovered, and our protagonists in Colorful are no different.<br />
<br />
Why certain individuals make the choices or decisions that they do and very often take action upon them, whether deliberately or simply out of blind impulse is a prominent theme in Colorful’s primary cast of characters. As depicted with Koboyashi’s mother and his crush in school, they both committed sins but don’t know how to reconcile them since they either believe it’s justified or are still essential in their lives. Discerning a sin or scar from their past that still prevails or lingers within their minds and personality is already a dreadful experience, but for someone dear to them it’s likely more difficult. As Colorful portrays in a genuine and flawless manner, for a loved one attempting to resolve a situation such as mentioned above, it’s a near incomprehensible conundrum, since you’re aiming to discern another one’s perspective for the solution. <br />
<br />
Though there are other characters that reflect and orient on the more optimistic side of Colorful, the endeavor of lasting friendship. Koboyashi had always been a deviant in society even before the soul swapping, and his school life was no different, he was ranked as the second worst of his class academically. The one student who performed worse than he did was Saotome, who was otherwise a very commendable and admirable individual. Eventually they form a bond of unyielding tight friendship and Saotome becomes the predominant for Koboyashis hope and aspiration to go on living.<br />
<br />
Art: Simply the art itself it fabulous but is not the reason why it is truly groundbreaking, what is was the style in which it’s portrayed and utilized. The intent and driving force for the varying and noticeable differences in art styles throughout was undoubtedly meant to amplify and magnify the substantial changes in the characters personalities and situational revelations occurring that had lasting effects. It quite simply makes a fantastic epic drama film even more emotionally thrilling to experience.<br />
<br />
Music: Though the music might have been more subtle than the art and visual execution was, this certainly doesn’t lessen its value or magnitude that it carried very well. <br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: Colorful has easily surpassed my disproportionately high expectations, especially for its gallant and comprehensive realistic drama. I felt passionately connected to each and every major character, not despite of, but because of their individual deficiencies and fortitude. This is the essence of what profound and astute drama can become if you truly are striving for it. <br />

    Yet another glorious movie that left me thinking about life more seriously than I should be at my age. Words can&#039;t express how outstanding this story is.<br />
<br />
The description would capture anyone with enough interest, I didn&#039;t care if I hated the story I wanted to know the answers to the synopsis - that&#039;s how much the storyline had me going. Luckily - there was 0 chance of me disliking this movie because it shed light on every doubt I never had. <br />
<br />
MC is strong-minded and arrogant BUT this is not a problem! Don&#039;t get me wrong, we want MC to be this way - he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186745">
        takes the biggest learning curve anyone could take in a lifetime and pursues it in the most creative way possible. <br />
<br />
The story is simple but within its simplistic nature is a complex core and by the end of the movie you will either be feeling super-duper happy and satisfied or super-duper happy and satisfied whilst crying lots. <br />
<br />
There may be parts of this film that you question why? But honestly, if you look at it from less of a &quot; This is an anime movie&quot; point of view - it will make sense I guarantee it 100% <br />
<br />
If there is only one thing I can press onto it would be the obnoxious and weird classmate of the MC - she can get on the nerves a little just for cramping the mood BUT that is just me trying to find something negative to play upon for the sake of this review.<br />
<br />

      Colorful is like a secret place of solitude that helps a person recuperate into humanity and society. It is like a living photograph of all the places you go, both inside yourself and in the world beyond, to meditate on what&#039;s important and who you are within the fragments of life. Sometimes being given a second chance and a different perspective is all it takes to see the world in a brand new light.<br />
<br />
Story: <br />
   The story for this anime is engaging and moves along at a fine pace. Slowly we are introduce to the elements that made one persons life

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37274">
        both rich and miserable and from there we learn what caused Makoto&#039;s decision to commit suicide. <br />
    What I found most intriguing was the method the anime took to unveiling these reasons and the little details shown to make the audience understand how important life&#039;s true connections are. Whether it&#039;s painting or being truly understood by someone, we all have something that changes our hearts and gives us a reason to go on. I felt this anime did a particularly good job at describing this to its audience. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
   Colorful is vivid and expressive anime, using painting as a medium for survival and contemplation. The still photography used in this anime tells a historical story of the nostalgia for a time that has past, and possibly never lived, but not forgotten. The skillful way it was incorporated is just another detail that made the anime enjoyable to watch and I found myself feeling that nostalgia along with the characters. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
  The sounds were always appropriate to the particular feelings of a scene, and although there is nothing particularly catchy about any of them, what struck me the most was how much I felt that the seiyuu (voice actors) for this movie had a real talent for their characters. I&#039;ve said often in this review how involved I was in the plot, and this was due mainly to the skill of the seiyuu, who I felt really embodied their characters, and the artists that created this world. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
    The characters are really alive and left me feeling as though I got to know them better. Their personalities show through very well, given the same amounts of detail and you are left with parts of them long after the anime has finished. Each scene with them is beautifully construct to let the viewer in a little more into their lives and who they genuinely are.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
   This anime was so engaging that I often could feel myself having great empathy for whatever a particular character was going through at any given time. I felt happy and introspective and sad and nostalgic right along with the characters and was carried away by their lives. I would definitely recommend this anime!

    I have a certain fear of what happens to humans after death. Do we go into a vast oblivion of darkness or do we get a second chance at life and become reincarnated? Since I brood over such trivial matters often, the plot for Colorful really caught my eye and I figured watching it would help me reach an answer. Well, not only did the movie get me closer to a sufficient answer, but it changed certain views of life that I had as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9.8/10<br />
The plot for Colorful was a simple yet broad subject. A second chance of life, how many of us would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112209">
        take that? Would it be a good or bad idea? I&#039;ve seen and read other stories that try to play around this concept, but Colorful&#039;s is unique. The journey of a person&#039;s discovery of sin in another sinner&#039;s body became as interesting as I hoped. While the movie was rather slow and dragged out for the first half of the movie, it created a build up that led to an ending that left a lasting impression. Colorful also explores the lessons of family, priorities, and friendship, all of which tied together well with the main plot. The ending was extremely satisfying and for a while after the movie, it makes you reflect on your own life as well. Philosophical and heart warming, Colorful&#039;s plot teaches life lessons that I never thought a movie could.  <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
Colorful had some pretty good quality as an anime movie. The animation for each movement was very fluid and each character was drawn clear, tiny details included. The character design was nothing too special (except PuraPura), but they were still drawn well and realistically enough for my liking. Backdrops ranging from train stations to forests and lakes were all beautifully done and lovely to look at. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 <br />
I gave sound an above average 8 because the soundtrack for Colorful just didn&#039;t really stick out to me that much. However, they did fit the story and setting well, so it was still good enough. The voice actor&#039;s for each character portrayed their given role and personalities well. No one felt too plain or forced. <br />
<br />
Character: 9.4/10<br />
When it comes to character, the one that I&#039;ll be focusing mainly on is Makoto. His personality was very interesting and wasn&#039;t that of a basic main character. His development throughout the movie was so endearing and I ended up rooting for him more than I thought. His growth was refreshing, eye opening, yet realistic enough to enjoy. The side characters, though not as important, were just as interesting as you get to know them more and more through the movie. Each person has their own secrets and little quirks and its hard to not to hate someone by the end of Colorful. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9.7/10<br />
Initially reading Colorful&#039;s plot, I had high expectations for the movie, and it was definitely filled. The overall impact and morals can be near life changing as it really turns your perspective on how you may live. Along with high quality animation and characters that could be your next door neighbor, Colorful is a fantastic movie and one that I won&#039;t forget.

<br />
The Story Shows Makoto&#039;s daily life, including family, school and character relationships. Slowly unveiling Makoto&#039;s life and his reasons for commiting suicide.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art is bright and vibrant, but dims down to suit darker moments. The Still art is extreamly beautiful and mixes well with moving art. Showing a Nice contrast between the two.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The sound is strong and works

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37051">
        really well with scenes within the movie. If its a high energetic, or a more slow dramtic scene. The sound supports it giving it an extreamly great viewing experience.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
The characters feel real and 3 dimensional. You can really get connected with alot of them. None of the characters feel annoying or forced and they all have there own part to play.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie is an amazing viewing experience. Sunrise did an amazing job with this. Im glad I took the time to watch it. If your looking for something with great drama and characters this is the movie to watch. I definitely recommend this to everyone

    (TLDR at the bottom, thanks for reading.)<br />
<br />
Colourful manages too something that seems impossible, it is simultaneously to long and too short. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost like the staff working made the film but the realised that the script and storyboards only cover an hour of screen time, so they decided to emphasise certain bit of the film to make it longer but only achieving making the overall pacing of the story was way longer than it needs to be. So even though this is a two-hour film, it barely achieves anything of value. It&#039;s one of those anime that is made so at the moment you think

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406188">
        it is really profound and deep but when you end up thinking about it a few months later the only think about the film you can remember is the final few minutes. As I am writing this review I am having to go back and rewatch sections of the film because the only thing I remember from my initial viewing is criticisms that I made (and the opening and ending scenes), and when the most memorable part of a film is the reasons you don&#039;t like it that is when you realise something went horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
The film starts with the rather effective hook of someone in the afterlife, a young boy, who is given the chance to relive his life and to prevent his own suicide. The overall directing of this scene is quite impressive. The camera is positioned in such a way that Purapura (the spirit guiding the souls of the dead) is always in the centre of the screen, his upbeat tone and boyish look clashing with the overall morbid nature of the scene, our main character (who we know nothing about) has his own voice muted and replaced by white words on a black background. The other souls represented by translucent 3d models in direct contrast to the 2d background and too Purapura who still takes up a large portion of the screen, the dichotomy between these models and 2d drawings is really effective at bringing across the uncanny nature of this scene. These entire few minutes, while impressive, probably hurt the overall experience as it puts the viewer&#039;s expectations higher than what the film can actually deliver.<br />
<br />
But after this opening scene the film throws us directly into the life of Makoto and its liner through line all but disappears as the viewer ends up watching Makoto live his day-to-day life, his encounters with friends and school, his relationship with his parents, the stresses of finding a new school and other fairly typical events in someone&#039;s life. Since the main focus is meant to be on the life of Makoto it is more of a collection of a bunch of random scenes with only some of them contributing to the actual plot and themes of the film, you could cut out a good chunk of the scenes in the middle of the film, and it would really detract from the film. There isn&#039;t much of a plot to colourful, there is the whole idea of Makoto being reincarnated, but that is mostly you used in the start and end of the films with the actual meat of the experience being the interpersonal relationships between Makoto and the rest of the cast, the problem is that Makoto is just an annoying character. He is arrogant and rude and bairly has any characterisation that can make him appealing despite his personality, maybe this lack of characterisation is done to make him seem like a typical school boy, but it just is one of the many issues that makes the time spent watching the film unpleasant. He does develop as a character but all of his development is kept to the final quarter of the film, so while it is great that he does develop most of the film we are stuck with and annoying MC and his development isn&#039;t particular noteworthy as it is just him learning to be a better person. The rest of the cast aren&#039;t any better, a lot of the characters that are around Makoto&#039;s age are similarly annoying or just have some really lacklustre characterisation that they are just boring to watch because their entire purpose is to talk to Makoto about some random event. There is one scene in the middle of the film where Makoto and his friends skip school and just end up walking around the town and talking about the history of it (it&#039;s more of Makoto&#039;s friend talking at him, though). But this scene is a bit of a waste of time as all it does it prove Makoto has a friend and due to the naturalistic approach to voice acting the series takes all the characters sound extremely uninterested and the lack of anything else to spice the scene up (like a good ost, impressive directing or noteworthy animation) the whole scene is just boring and has no real place in the story, and for the over all length of the scene it barely impacts the actual film.<br />
<br />
And after some heart-to-hearts between Makoto and his parents the film stumbles into its ending, where its entire message is made clear in an overly ham-fisted and preachy way, that people are multifaceted, you could even say that people are “colourful” and the film wants to make sure you understand this by saying it multiple times, the staff were trying so hard to make sure that the viewers understand this message that they have the big conclusion that the answer is spelled out right in the title. My main issue with this isn&#039;t the lack of subtlety or the obtuse nature that the film takes in preventing its themes, it&#039;s that it is fairly obvious to most people. We&#039;ve spent our entire lives living around over people and learning that they aren&#039;t black and white or easy to fit into categories. In the anime community to outsiders it might look like we are one homogenous group but as you can see there are plenty of different types of people, you&#039;d have to be colour-blind to think that life is not colourful and then for this film to come round like it has made some grand revelation on human nature just feels wrong, we already know what the film is trying to say so no matter what the film does say we already know these messages and then combined this with the lack of anything conclusive happening to Makoto just makes the ending sub-par.<br />
<br />
Even with all of these issues, the film just isn&#039;t that entertaining.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Too long with sup-par voice acting leading to a disappointing conclusion.

    This will be the first review I actually write for a movie that I didn&#039;t enjoy.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Okay so the story has a pretty good plot line with a lot of potential, plenty of time to develop it well, some good turns and twists, and overall some good writing. It had enough of a story going that I wanted to know what happened and kept me watching throughout the entire 2 hour film. <br />
<br />
However with all the potential that it posessed to keep a viewer interested, I was so bored. I wanted to know how it ended and I wanted to see where the story went, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71515">
        I was counting down the minutes to the end by halfway through. I give the writers props for coming up with a plot that&#039;s unique in it&#039;s own way and with the potential and the synopsis to get the viewers that it gets, but I couldn&#039;t sit through this movie again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The art style in this movie is reminiscent of the style put into more realistically drawn Ghibli films such as Grave of the Fireflies. Its pretty and the movements are smooth and it doesn&#039;t fall into the common style of &quot;just change the hair and you have a new character&quot; that a lot of anime in the past 10 years especially fall into.<br />
<br />
The backgrounds especially are extremely detailed in mostly a good way. Considering it&#039;s movie about an artist you have to expect some of the art to live up to the character&#039;s standards and it does. My major problem with the animation would probably be that the real life backgrounds and cut scenes always seemed out of place. That and the opening scene with the terrible CG had me praying that it didn&#039;t carry out through the show and luckily it didn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Music played barely any role in this movie. I could hear the background music but it didn&#039;t really dominate a scene which is both good and bad. I don&#039;t think that I could remember this movie by any special song and the music is normally something that sticks with a person even if they don&#039;t realize it.<br />
There isn&#039;t too much that I can say about it either though, it was so slow paced with the same loop of music that I can&#039;t complain or comment so that&#039;s all I really have to say on the subject.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Makoto Kobayashi. Okay so here is our protagonist. Yes he&#039;s pretty dynamic. He goes from soft spoken, to confused, to nice, to total douche then back to being nice. He doesn&#039;t change enough for me to say that the plot really progressed his character though. It more seems like instead of the plot changing him to a different person it&#039;s bringing him back to who he was. And he was a very boring guy. <br />
<br />
Mother. She has the potential to really carry the storyline to a wonderful climax but instead she just sits there and cries. She doesn&#039;t change in any way to help or hender the storyline.<br />
<br />
Father. He&#039;s the peacekeeper of the show but considering that absolutely noone besides Makoto makes any conflict, and you&#039;re really on his side? Nothing you do matters. You&#039;re just kind of there to take up space.<br />
<br />
Mitsuru. Another character that has the potential to drive the plot, and in certain instances he really does and I like him for that. I wish that the writers had given him more because he only got really 2 good scenes that gave him the depth I feel his character deserved.<br />
<br />
Sano. She is extremely static. She is insecure and awkward and even makes the main feel awkward. Sure I feel sorry for her in one scene but if she didn&#039;t exist I feel like the plot would have really been almost exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Hiroka. This character has such a deep story going for her that should be made into something just for her, but instead the main character gives her some truly beautiful words and then she&#039;s gone from the story and nothing more is said. <br />
<br />
Purapura. He is one more character that has the potential to be his own story. I want to know more about him! And I never will! <br />
<br />
Saotome. I don&#039;t know anything about him. He&#039;s poor and smiley. Woo.<br />
<br />
Overall none of these characters were developed. They are all just there as background art with words. They have maybe one or two scenes where they push Makoto into something but for the most part Makoto pushes the story on his own and they are all useless characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t recommend this movie to anyone really. I see the wonderful reviews of this movie and I can&#039;t see why it deserves it. I was bored, I learned a lot about a character I disliked and nothing about the characters I liked. The music I couldn&#039;t even comment on and the art style was the only good thing going for it.<br />
<br />
I wish I could put more detail into my review but as long and slow paced as this story was, I barely got anything from it.

    The film &quot;Colorful&quot; is quite a deep film. Yet it is filled with depression, if you want a happy film (for most of the way) that makes you feel good, this is not it. Although the ending is quite inspiring.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it&#039;s the small things in life that cause the most influence.<br />
<br />
The story of a middle schooler, Makoto Kobayashi who commit suicide after witnessing some - to him - emotionally crushing events.<br />
Now a random soul in a room of souls, here to basically be banished from the ability to reincarnate, has won &quot;The Lottery&quot; to be reincarnated whether he wants to or not. He will inhabit

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87433">
        the recently deceased Makoto, and in order to complete &quot;The Trial&quot; he must remember his sin, almost without any help.<br />
His family and a few people along the way try to help him in his life.<br />
<br />
This is a strange film. It is almost unbearably depressing, and even more so, because it very realistic.<br />
But, it is a very deep film, with some amazing lines that are hard to miss. Although, I only noticed most of them around the last 30 minutes of the film. <br />
This is most definitely a slice of life film in a realistic, drama filled setting. The type of drama in this picture is extremely passive aggressive, with unaddressed remorse and regret. Being someone who has experienced and been apart of this type of personality, it really hit home and made me feel more depressed while watching.<br />
You can tell I do not like these types of films.<br />
<br />
But that is just me, this film is beautiful work.<br />
<br />
They took a realistic approach with the art, which made the story even more effective. The animation is mostly fluid, and facial expressions are well done.<br />
<br />
The music in this film is your basic Kow Ohtani sound, except higher quality. You could say it&#039;s in league with the score of &quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; respectively. Other than a couple of pieces that annoyed me (I&#039;ve listened to a lot of Kow Ohtani), It fit the production very well. Amazingly he managed to make the film feel even more depressing.<br />
The seiyuu are mostly very well done. Sometimes Makoto sounds like a man doing a high pitch voice though (apparently that is what the Seiyuu is actually doing, go figure). Some scenes with yelling (Not many yelling scenes) could have used a bit more power in the diaphragm in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Every character in this show is dysfunctional. Makoto&#039;s family is extremely dysfunctional, including Makoto.<br />
<br />
PuraPura is an &quot;Angel&quot; who gave the &quot;random&quot; spirit, now in the body of Makoto, a &quot;Second Chance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Makoto Kobayashi is the character that you learn about in this film, so any development here would spoil the movie. I&#039;ll mention that he&#039;s confused in the beginning.<br />
<br />
Makoto no Haha is Makoto&#039;s mother, she has some personal problems.<br />
Makoto no Chichi is Makoto&#039;s dad, he has some personal problems.<br />
Mitsuru Kobayashi is Makoto&#039;s brother, he also has some personal problems.<br />
They are mostly not addressed, but you can tell on their faces and in the way they speak to each other.<br />
<br />
Satome, Hiroka, and Shouko are the &quot;Friends&quot; that help Makoto remember his sin and basically live, all in a very dysfunctional way.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
This film is a great film, it teaches the importance of being alive, that little things can be important, and you can learn some amazing things at the most unusual times, places, and events, unexpectedly, and even more. This is a very deep film.<br />
<br />
I must warn you though, this is a depressing film, and doesn&#039;t do anything to change that, and some may not feel better by the end. Luckily, I did.<br />
<br />
I do think this film deserves its awards, and praise, but It&#039;s not the type of film I would visit often, maybe never again.

    One night I&#039;m challenged to watch this movie with friends.<br />
They were pretty hyped for it and so I followed, in antecipation, waiting for a good movie. What did I get? A terrible one.<br />
<br />
Where do I start?<br />
The plot starts off pretty interesting, it makes you question, it leaves you hyped for a really cool movie, which unfortunately turns out to be pretty lame.<br />
It consists essentially of a kid struggling with common life problems (be it family, friendship-related, school-related, etc.) who gradually goes about making sense of it all, understanding how to look at life, making friends, becoming a new kid entirelly, culminating with a plot-twist which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180746">
        I honestly saw coming and which didnt affect me much to be honest. <br />
As far as the plot&#039;s concerned I&#039;ll give it a solid 6/10., it&#039;s neither good nor bad, it&#039;s just a plot.<br />
<br />
I must also note that the MC has a terribly emotionless personality and I couldnt get attatched to him very much. <br />
<br />
Now let me get into what really fails in this movie.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty, but oh god did I have to lower the rating on it.<br />
<br />
The CGI was like something from the early 90s, which DIDNT BLEND AT ALL into the anime, and what were they thinking when they decided it would be cool to put real life photos as backgrounds?? WERE THEY SERIOUSLY HOPING WE WOULDNT NOTICE? WAS IT SUPPOSED TO BE NOTICED? It was hideous.<br />
<br />
The music is forgetable.<br />
<br />
The time I wasted on it will not come back.<br />
<br />
Overall it was an ok movie but only because I watched it with friends, it&#039;s again, one of such movies where most 8s and 9s out of 10 come from weeboo &quot;anime appreciators&quot; who clearly cannot tell the flaws of a movie and although singular opinions are  to be respected, it should not be expected of me to understand such opinions when there is clearly so much flaw to be seen in this movie. <br />
<br />
It is NOT that great and overall I give it a 4/10.

    This movie opened up a lot in me (for real), it was just that good. Words can&#039;t express how good of a story this was.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around a spirit who got an &quot;internship&quot; to get into the body of Makoto Kobayashi who just committed suicide. The spirit must make use of this internship for his good and find out the reason why Makoto committed suicide. This game of internship gives us a colorful story of that family and how it revolves around the emotion of MC.<br />
<br />
The movie is a glorious one, the story is beautiful. At first, you may seem to hate MC(the reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368725">
        why many drop this) but he gradually grows in us in a very good way, the story shows us the value of life, friendship, and forgiveness. You may feel uneasy in the beginning but it ends in a much satisfying way.:)

    Feeling emotional over an anime can differ between people. A type of anime can make a person cry or another laugh. For me, it&#039;s a bit hard to cry watching anime, since the characters are cartoons and not realistic. But this movie is actually the first anime I actually cried multiple times during it. How? Well, let&#039;s go on with the review then and find out.<br />
<br />
The plot of Colorful gets a 10 because on how the story captures you completely emotionally, luring you in some twists and turns to the end, which is pretty surprising and gives you a fulfilled feeling. <br />
The story starts with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51219">
        us watching a spirit leaving our world for the afterlife, shown as a bus station. We learn that the spirit was kicked off the cycle of reincarnation because of the sin it committed, but doesn&#039;t remember what it was. An angel then comes up to it in a form of a young boy, who tells it that it won a lottery and gets a chance to go back to earth to regain its memory back of its sin and life.  With that, it wakes up in the body of Makoto, a 14-year-old boy who committed suicide. We  then go through the life of the spirit inside of Makoto  and learn about what led up to Makoto&#039;s death and learn what is the spirit&#039;s sin.<br />
 <br />
The Art of the movie can be only as described as beautifully made. It really captures the reality of the movie, while giving that supernatural feeling in the mix. You can tell the artists of this movie actually went to lengths to capture the real places of Japan for the movie, so I give it a 10.<br />
<br />
The Sound was as expected, giving the mystical parts where it&#039;s suppose to be and giving the dramatic parts as well. Not a big music buff, not really my area. But it&#039;s good, so a 10.<br />
<br />
The Characters are the main part of the story, besides the story. While some anime only give a part of the story with side characters, this was not like that. We know as many characters are we suppose to know and all of them get background, not much but enough to know about them and feel for them and are actually part of the main story and cast. Also the good thing about the characters is the development of all of them, not just Makoto. You really connect with him, including the side characters.<br />
 We learn about how Makoto&#039;s death was led up, which can pull your heartstrings a bit for all who been bullied. But let me just say, it was the worst day someone can have that led to his death. There is that moment where we learn that you actually say, &quot;THAT&#039;S FUCKED UP! It&#039;s like telling the kid, &quot;Fuck you.&quot; You know when you start yelling at the screen that you are really connecting with the story and characters.  Which is why this part also gets a 10, for well rounded characters and making us really connect with the main cast and the side characters.<br />
<br />
So did I enjoy this as a person? I should say yes. Like, I said in the beginning of this review, I never cry for an anime. For this anime, it&#039;s a first. I felt really connected with the characters, especially Makoto that at some points of the movie, I cried. <br />
But one thing that made me like this movie is it also gives you a lesson at the end, that you can change your life right now if you want to, not in the way of the story went but if you change your perspective a bit, think a bit more positive, your future and life can turn brighter. So for my overall score I give it a 10. For good story telling, art and character development. So if you want a good drama with some supernatural in the mix, you should watch it! <br />

    Colorful begins from the first person perspective, with the hero’s words being written rathen than spoken. I have to admit, this is a very interesting choice for an opening, which reminded me of visual novel games a bit and got me instantly interested in what was about to happen. As it turns out, the main character has just died and is now given a chance for a resurrection. In order to have it given to him, he has to pass a certain test. His soul is transported into a body of young boy who nearly passed away in a suicide attempt. The task that is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267069">
        given to our MC will require him not only to be able to continue living as a new person, but to remember and atone for the sin he commited during his own life as well.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I am not really sure of how accurate that summary was. And this is not due to me hardly remembering the movie (which I kinda wish was the case) or it having a very complex plot, making it hard to give a decent explanation of it within such a brief paragraph. Instead, I have to put the blame on what seems to be the this title’s largest shortcoming - it’s a complete and utter mess.<br />
<br />
This is a little surprising, seeing that Colorful doesn’t bring up a whole lot of characters or themes, but it still manages to continuosly forget about the ones it did thgoughout its duration. As a result, the movie ends up with a line-up of people who are not only not given any kind of development, but are left halfway through their exposition when the ending credits roll in.<br />
<br />
The only character which I felt was decently introduced and deserved their place in Colorful was Saotoma. His subplot seems to be the one that actually pushes the protagonist and the plot into some kind of direction, too bad it takes place exlusively within the last one-third of the movie. As a result, we are left wondering what is even the whole point of it throughout the rest of the time. Although, to be frank, I’m still not 100% sure about what it was even now.<br />
<br />
To give you a better example of how severely Colorful lacks any kind of focus, let’s talk about some more adult-like themes it throws at the viewer. And there are at least two big ones, namely betrayal and prostitution. I won’t go into details to avoid spoilers, but if you watch it expecting some kind of an actual look into those issues, you’ll come out dissapointed. It’s a bit like virtue signaling, except the authors don’t even have balls to actually condemn those sorts of behaviours, they just throw them into vacuum and never do anything with them. Maybe this was an attempt to make the movie seem more edgy and appeal to certain types of demographic, but instead it came out totally out of place.<br />
<br />
However, the absolute cherry on top when it comes to lack of direction in Colorful was the moment when its creators realised they forgot to actually put its keynote into it. To fix it, they decided to make the protagonist blurt it out in the middle of the dialogue with barely no context, while the person they were talking to just nods silently, listening to an explanation of the movie’s title. Unfortunately, I cannot bring myself to fully hate this moment, because while the MC was talking, his school’s graduation song was also playing in the background and I happen to have a particular weakness to those. In the end, I had a very weird moment of contrast, when the worst and the best thing I was able to hear throughout this movie both happened simultaniously.<br />
<br />
Speaking of contrast, this words also deserves its place when talking about Colorful’s visuals. I definetely have to apploud the backgrounds - while they’re not quite on Shinkai’s levels, they are still really well made, vivid and detailed. On the opposite side, the character designs are pretty poor, even scruffy. Their animation is even worse, especially when it comes to walking or running, which seems very sluggish and at times the framerate for it is really low. You can really tell the difference between the level of detail put into those respective aspects and the overall impression is similiar to a poor green screen effect.<br />
<br />
I was hoping the whole mess in the direction would eventually be given some kind of explanation, but in the end all of it was left to my own imagination. Was the movie trying to be an elaborate metaphore of our own lives, which can be very chaotic as well? Unfortunately, this is but a poor excuse for the Colorful’s very apparent issues and I can’t bring myself to handle it to it.<br />
<br />
The ending doesn’t help much either. Instead of leaving me with a good final impression, it brings the exact same resolution I was guessing would happen six minutes into the damn thing. And to make it even worse, it gives hardly any explation as to how the protagonist was able to solve the puzzle, making it even less satisfying than I was expecting.<br />
<br />
All in all, watching Colorful was but a waste of time. I might end up being a bit salty about it, seeing that is was the first anime I decided to watch in the new year 2018, but the rating I decided to handle it is what I give to series that might have some pros to it, but are largely overshadowed by their cons. I believe this is what constitues as a fair judgement for this movie.

    If you haven&#039;t seen this yet, I suggest you do. It&#039;s a pretty deep thoughtful anime and it&#039;s one that probably anyone who has family problems (probably everyone) can relate to. <br />
<br />
Story: One thing this OVA has going for it is it&#039;s story. I catches from the opening and pretty much never lets go. The drama keeps piling on until the climax and keeps thinking about how it will end. I was very satisfied with the ending.<br />
<br />
Art: Very good, there&#039;s nothing more to say than that. It has a more realistic approach on the way people look, so it feels a lot more &quot;adult&quot; like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38413">
        (no not the XXX version). No big eyes and prominent fangs sticking out in this one. Motion was good, facial expression very nicely done.<br />
<br />
Sound: I didn&#039;t really pay much attention to be honest, but it did suit the mood well for the situation that occurs on screen, nothing much more to say than that. Voice actors did an excellent job in my honest opinion of conveying the feelings of the particular situations.<br />
<br />
Characters: I really liked this the most out of the anime. To the minor characters to the bigger ones, they all seemed very interesting and you wanted to know more about them. Of course the main character had most of the time, but by the end of the movie you get a sense of satisfaction from all the characters. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: I give it a 10. I think the movie was great at the most important parts the story and characters. While the art and sounds (music) might not appeal to all, it&#039;s story will captivate you and the characters will keep you interested. I definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes a good story and great characters.

    Colorful - a wonderful movie that keeps your emotions running. This movie follows the story about a soul that has won a lottery, allowing him to return to the normal world to find out the sin that he committed.<br />
<br />
Although the movie starts off slow, you will surely love it when it ends. This movie teaches the audience how important life is and why we should cherish everyday as though it is our last.<br />
<br />
The art in this movie was done very well. The use of still photo pictures was brilliant to show how life was back in the days. The characters were drawn consistently throughout the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38305">
        movie. <br />
<br />
The sound and background music that were used were synced to the scene in the movie. The one thing about the sound that I did not go crazy about was the voice actor for Kobayashi Makoto. As readers of this review, you may have different opinions of it but to me, there was not enough emotion into what he was saying. The emotion of the voice was not consistent throughout the movie, other than that, I had no problems with the movie.<br />
<br />
The characters of the movie were well-developed. Each supporting character had about the same amount of screen time. The personalities of each and every character were brought up.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. The producers of the movie did a splendid job in creating this movie. I&#039;m glad I took the time to view this.

    Likes its title, this movies really colorful, which is almost make me screaming with full of emotion. No matter what, what ever people said, the moral message get really deep into my inner heart. The ending too was really shock me, and even get attacking my weak heart so hard. So meaning, im crying in the end. Im crying like a baby when the last painting is able to be finished. Purapura, and his misteryous backstory will ever get into my mind for another day in the future. Oh well!<br />
<br />
By raising super heavy themes, such as near death, reincarnation, and the twists-turns schemes of dark

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336148">
        life in the world, this old film is able to turn that heavy view into an animated story that is so light, and of course being colorful. Thats the mark with bold sign by me: A colorful life. Why you wanna die if the life truely colorful? Even every people in this world get worst part than yours, but they still work hard to make theirself happy. Why you sad over something when that thing must become your great thing? <br />
<br />
Because humans do not consist of only one kind of color. But from a variety of colors. Although it comes from a dirty color, like a black, everything is not wrong. What we need to do is keep moving forward in full color. Because we will never know the color of our own lives. Because our lifes are so colorful. So, why do we have to give up and let the color disappear? Those are some of the phrases tucked in the strands of conversation that flows so beautifully in these film. Really amazing, i even can not say anything except tearing my eyes. How silly me, but thats shit actually happen, man, really.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even need to explain anymore for the development of stories and even characters. Everything flows so beautifully. A fantastic approaching really show to me how hard they make this masterpiece becomes real. Carefully, they play the audience&#039;s feelings with all the explanations given. All moral messages can be conveyed clearly, until the end of the separation. Yes, i shall this from very early attempts, this show is masterpiece. 10 per 10 for all parts, all sections, i give my respect for the story, and its studio whom make this magnificent animations. Simple, but full of emotion, full of moral lesson. This show is for you. Who believe, Suicide is the best way to end the suffering.<br />
<br />
That is the biggest mistake. Because you can still be useful, even for others who don&#039;t care at all. There is always a way to continue to contribute, even if its small. No need to worry, your problem always same for the other person. So why you worry that much and burrying it by yourself? Share it, and you will get your color becomes the truth.<br />
<br />
Ah, maybe its too much. But, this review still be my shortest approaching for the movies. However, what else i can write? All good thing just pointed out above, nothing else can i write. Just see by yourself, and feel the MC feelimg into the shiney one. Believe it, keep believing, and colorful being began to shine.

    Colorful was a very interesting movie. The plot was highly original but it was transparent to see where it was gonna end up. This doesn&#039;t take away from the over all experience that is this movie tho.<br />
<br />
The art for colorful is a pretty detailed and kinda bland looking but that&#039;s cause its supposed to be realistic. It is also that way so we can kinda immerse ourselves in the character more emotionally. I dont feel like the art was outstanding or a masterpiece but its realism is perfect for the atmosphere and subject matter.<br />
<br />
The sounds of this movie are alright, i don&#039;t really have much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review79288">
        of a opinion of it. i think it did really well of accenting the atmosphere so much i hardly noticed it, in and of itself. Which is not a bad thing, it means it became part of a greater experience which is a lot better than had i just sat there admiring the music over the rest of the scene. With a movie like this your trying to create a very emotional experience that needs a certain amount of immersion that the music needs to help convey.<br />
<br />
The characters were very deep in emotion. The characters kinda come off as boring people but that&#039;s the way there meant to be. They all give off this kinda hopeless and dark feeling. I like how every character has there own relationship built with the main character that gets explored and developed upon threw the whole movie and nobody really feels like there just there for the sake of being there.<br />
<br />
I enjoy this movie cause it makes me feel, it makes me think and it just gives me a atmosphere i can become part of. Everything in this movie just creates such relatable and immersible emotional scenes, i just couldn&#039;t appreciate the that enough. I do wish there had been more of a mystery to how it would end but i can say i&#039;m satisfied with this movie and glad i sat down to watch it. I think if you ever have feelings of powerlessness or just a general depression you can relate to this movie on a personal level that will give you a really good feeling in the end.

    This worthwhile movie explores the importance of valuing ones life despite the hardships one would frequently confront in it. This theme is explored through a lost soul who occupies the body of a teenage boy who took his life through suicide and must figure out the sin that led him to his death as he experiences the boy&#039;s life. Colorful delivers enough depth at exploring the life of Makoto and the relationships he had with his family and classmates prior to his death. The movie isn&#039;t afraid at pulling its punches with exploring both the good and bad sides of living as we come to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47275">
        see Makoto being an outcast at his school and having some serious problems within his family, as well as the soul within him coming to value the bonds he comes to establish with those that care for Makoto despite the shortcomings he had prior. Some have commented on Makoto coming across as unlikeable at points during scenes where he lashed out at others and distanced himself from school and family. Yet considering how miserable his life was before his suicide attempt, his anger towards life in general seemed justified given what he discovers about those close to him. Yet his character does gradually get better when he comes to find a few classmates that care for him and coming to learn that his family still cares for him despite the problems they had prior.<br />
<br />
The only element to the movie I found lacking was focus on Purapura&#039;s character as he only appears frequently during most moments when Makoto was venting at his family and classmates with the spirit reprimanding him for his actions, as well as not being able to learn very much about his character. Compared to what I seen with Makoto establishing bonds with his family and classmates, I couldn&#039;t find myself buying Makoto&#039;s connection to Purapura due to this minimal focus.<br />
<br />
In terms of presentation, Colorful makes use of subdued color tones in depicting its down-to-earth and realistic look into Makoto&#039;s problems. Scenery is highly detailed featuring vast shots of city and forest landscapes. While character designs and animation aren&#039;t too impressive quality-wise, characters are drawn in realistic detail and move about at a fluid pace, as well as while in vehicles. The animation highlight for me in the movie was the beginning featuring a first person perspective of the lost soul being in line in the afterlife with its abstract style and lifeless look at lost souls prepared to exit the cycle of reincarnation. The movie&#039;s soundtrack is just as subdued in tone featuring piano, stringed and low-key brass music played in both dramatic and joyful moments, which fits perfectly with Colorful&#039;s varying moods of tense and happier moments.<br />
<br />
Overall, Colorful made quite the impression on me thanks to its meaningful message on valuing life and not being afraid at tackling some shaky social issues that effected Makoto such as bullying, marital affair and compensated dating. Those looking for a worthwhile down-to-earth drama should be willing to give this movie a shot.
