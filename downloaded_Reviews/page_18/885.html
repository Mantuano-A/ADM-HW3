    Ghost Hunt is one of those rare gems that I accidentally stumbled across, and I&#039;m so thankful that I did.<br /><br />The greatest asset of this series is the characters.  Their personalities are rich and engaging, and their memorable interactions with one another is one of the greatest selling points of this series.  It is one of the main aspects that makes you want to keep watching episode to episode.<br /><br />Yes, the storyline is superb, and the arcs are usually kept to 3 to 4 episodes.  This keeps the series watchable without frustrating the viewer, waiting for an arc or storyline to end.<br /><br />This series is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163">
        not scary at all, but can be quite suspenseful at times.  It keeps the &quot;creepiness&quot; to a minimum, but at times, you still find yourself walking around the house to turn on all the lights.  It&#039;s purpose is not to scare you, but to keep you glued to your screen, which it does beautifully.<br /><br />For me, the humor in this series is also one of the most enjoyable aspects.  There are moments when my family would literally bust out laughing, to the point of cackling.  The relationship between Naru-chan and Mai, or Bou-san and Ayako will keep you in stitches.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this series enough, and I&#039;m attempting to get as many Ghost Hunt converts as I can!<br /><br />Watch this series!!  You will not be disappointed!

    When looking at the different genres Ghost Hunt takes on I could only think it was doomed on arrival, taking on the supernatural horror mystery genre as well as the Shoujo Romance genre? How can it possibly present both of those properly and simultaneously? The answer is it couldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (3): The premise revolves around a group of paranormal investigators who investigate reports of spiritual activity and as such the series is divided into 7 cases as opposed to having one overarching story. Sounds like it could be interesting however what lets the plot-lines down for pretty much all of these cases are the poorly written

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165481">
        mysteries. If you like mystery stories that leave clues for you to pick up and try and piece them together to work out the conclusion then this one is not for you, all the focus goes towards telling you the back story of the ghost which is hardly exciting when you know it&#039;s all going to be disregarded as soon as the next mystery rolls along and isn&#039;t all that memorable anyway. On top of that every case resolves by the main detective revealing information that was never there for the audience or the other characters for that matter to be able to solve the case before. This essentially gives the rest of the characters no real purpose to the story unless the ghost goes berserk and they need to get blasted by one of the other characters... magic powers.<br />
<br />
Yes there are magic powers in this show and it pretty much ruins everything good the show DID have going for it in the first place. In the first case there was a very nice balance of scientific and computer based ghost catching methods in harmony with increments of supernatural abilities coming into play which made it feel like a show such as Most Haunted if there actually were any ghosts to catch. However as the cases go on the scientific methods of catching ghosts gets less and less and the magic powers become more and more relevant until it gets downright ridiculous. By the last case the cast are basically DBZ fighting zombies and there&#039;s no sense of mystery and using logic which is what the show set up it would be about originally so it just becomes a train-wreck of shark jumps.<br />
<br />
Fans of long running shows will probably not enjoy the structure of the series. The fact each arc is 3-5 episodes long and have no effect on any future events pretty much means your watching an episodic show where the episodes are dragged out ridiculously, so essentially to all non-episodic fans, you will probably find the pacing to be tortuously slow.<br />
<br />
The romance between the two main characters is awful, it&#039;s all done in this dream sequence where the female protagonist Mai sees her love interest Naru in a different light to what he&#039;s like in real life and she starts to fall in love with him through that? Are we&#039;re expected to believe that this is enough to build a romance from? No, just no, you need to show characters getting closer through common ground, mutual respect and care for one another, not through contrived dream sequences. <br />
<br />
On top of that the series ends openly with no catharsis to the characters or any conclusion to this retarded excuse for a romance, probably to leave the romantic mystery open for a second season which thank god never happened. It would have been much better for it to have been self contained and offering some sort of conclusion but given how little there was building up to anything I guess there&#039;s no reason to be terribly disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (2): The characters don&#039;t seem too bad at first but there are major problems. First of all the main character Mai is handled very badly, too idealistic all the time which gets very annoying and essentially sounds like she&#039;s preaching morals to the audience. She is also completely insignificant to every mystery except for maybe the last two and the only reason she&#039;s involved with the Shibuya Psychic Research Center in the first place is because of an accident that caused her to owe the main detective guy money, so she has no motivation at all besides paying off her debt, it&#039;s on the same level as Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club where she broke the vase except that was satirical, this is meant to be taken seriously! Also what&#039;s this, a backdrop attempt where we find out Mai has no parents, oh wait, only mentioned once and never referred to again, doesn&#039;t do her character any justice, not important to any event. One of the worst main characters EVER!<br />
<br />
The main detective in the show Naru is way too calm no matter how threatening the supernatural situation is, all decision making is too easy for him and there&#039;s never any conflict. It doesn&#039;t help that Mai&#039;s insignificance makes you think he should be the main character since he&#039;s the man solving the mysteries, an indication of bad writing but it doesn&#039;t matter anyway because his attitude towards everything just leaves him as a one dimensional and boring character except for when that lame dream sequence bullshit happens.<br />
<br />
Every other character has their moments of being enjoyable and sometimes funny which is the only reason the character score isn&#039;t at rock bottom but they still suffer through having no character development throughout the show. By its conclusion there&#039;s no change to them as people as to what you see in episode 1. The only thing that changes is that they get along better with each other as the series goes on but that doesn&#039;t make them any more interesting as individuals.<br />
<br />
They did attempt to develop the cold harsh guy Lin but it was ridiculous. He explains to Mai the reason he hates her is because of a deep seeded hatred he has towards the Japanese because of the conflict they&#039;ve had with China and then he gets one friendship speech from Mai and he immediately 180 degrees mood swings to being alight with her, that&#039;s not character development, that&#039;s forced bullshit writing.<br />
<br />
The funny monk character gets revealed to be a rock star on the side at the beginning of one of the episodes (because monk and rock star go hand in hand right?) but then IT&#039;S NEVER REFERRED TO AGAIN! What was the point in revealing that information if it doesn&#039;t serve his character any purpose in the story?<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (6): Despite being technically better than the story and the characters this is where the mix of horror mystery and shoujo falling flat on its face shows best. You take one look at the way these characters are drawn and try and imagine how you can get any scary looking ghosts or other creatures out of this style? It&#039;s impossible, even with a ton of blood over their faces that still doesn&#039;t make their Shoujo eyes and generic faces any more threatening on screen. I will admit though that the background art can be very unsettling at times due to the great use of lighting and colour, the case involving the bloody labyrinth in particular was the only case that had me on edge just because of how unpleasant it was to be in that room so kudos to that much at least.<br />
<br />
The animation is hit and miss, some scenes had good animation like the shattering glass from the second one and the action scenes were actually very fluid for the most part despite being shark jumping but then there&#039;s others where the characters move in key frames and is very choppy. The use of transitions was also very cheap and there&#039;s too many scenes where boxes pop up with the characters faces talking as if the animators didn&#039;t want to have to draw another angle from whatever the first shot was and keep to the scene. Also what was up with the animation for the opening for the first half of the show? A bunch of balls flying around fading out to a fog effect after a while? Was that the best you could do? Apparently not! In the second half of the show they actually came up with something more creative, nothing special but more interesting than orbs flying around which basically proves that they knew they&#039;d fucked up the previous animation for the opening, which leads us nicely into-<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (8): Probably the best aspect of the show, the opening and ending themes are fantastic, had the animation been better to accompany it I would call it one of my favourites. The BGM is also very good albeit not to memorable, there&#039;s only a handful of tracks that stand out and the music that is supposed to be scary is just too overblown as if it was trying to compensate for the Shoujo looking ghosts. As you can probably guess, it didn&#039;t work.<br />
<br />
I have nothing to say about the sound effects, they were fine and did their job well, nothing memorable but far from the worst aspect of the show.<br />
<br />
I mostly watch dubbed anime so I can only critique the performances of the English dub and I have to say it was actually very good. The actors and actresses actually represented their characters well and could display emotional range, also during normal talking parts they don&#039;t ever sound monotonous. The voice acting unfortunately is not enough to save the terrible writing for these characters but they did their best for the material that was given to them so to dub fans like me, here&#039;s another good one! To non-dub fans, here&#039;s one that doesn&#039;t suck! <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (2): This is one of the most boring shows I&#039;ve watched in my entire life. The plot failed to engage me because of the little focus on what makes a good mystery, the romance was corny, the animation didn&#039;t suit what was meant to be the scary moments for the most part and the characters were either annoying or lacked any reason for me to care about them. I enjoyed the music here and there and sometimes it was interesting to look at which again prevents me from putting the score at rock bottom but in terms of script and cast it failed to interest me at all and those are far more important elements.<br />
<br />
Overall (3): I know some people like it but honestly Ghost Hunt is a failed experiment, the Shoujo style takes away any potential for the show to be scary and the fact that it has to be a mystery show and a horror show as well as a Shoujo means it can&#039;t even take the time to develop a good romance for people who came for that, it fails in both ways. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this shitty anime. Only recommended for people who aren&#039;t at all demanding in story and characters, like their romances to be as loose as possible and have no stomach for scary stuff.

    Story: <br />
The story for Ghost Hunt is a very fun and interesting one. And at least for me, unique. It takes on an unusual way of telling about ghost hunting, giving you a look into the more scientific and realistic ways ghost hunting actually works.(Ar rather would work if it was real)<br />
It is also told well, the episodes, or cases, are all full of twists that keep you guessing and wondering what&#039;s going to happen next. And it never fails to give you a complete and satisfying ending. Not to mention that each case is very different from the others, so there is a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3242">
        of variety in what happens in the end. <br />
A 10 on story from me.<br />
<br />
Art: <br />
Some might say the art is rather plain. While I&#039;ll not deny this, I must say for me I thought it worked very well with the series. The simpleness of the art in general makes it easy for them to pick something and have it stand out. So it&#039;s very effective in a horror story. And I must say, I did very much like the way they did characters. And the shading on the art also caught my attention for being nice and comfortable. <br />
A 9 on art from me.<br />
<br />
Sound/Music:<br />
As a suspense/horror anime sound is extremely important. I cannot stress this point enough. Having the proper sound effects and score can make or break a series like this. And I must say I thought that Ghost Hunt had both an excellent soundtrack(I listen to my copy of it often)and did an excellent job with the sound effects. Both were well chosen and put into use wonderfully. <br />
A 10 on sound/music from me. <br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I fell in love with almost all the characters in this show for one reason or another. The funny and sweet Bou-san, and proud and somewhat rude Ayako. They all were well used and their was a large variety f personalities in the show.<br />
I will say that I wish they had given some more background on some of the characters. But it could also be said that not giving away to much information could be a good thing. Especially in Naru&#039;s case. The fact we have so little information about him makes his character more interesting and mysterious. <br />
(However more information then in the anime is given in the manga)<br />
A 9 on character form me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I loved this series the first time I watched it. And then I went back and watched it again not to long later, and loved it even more that time. Then a third time I watched and yet again loved it more, to the point of starting the manga. For me, that is the mark of a true masterpiece. Especially considering that this show was a mystery, yet I loved it still more every time I watched it despite knowing the ending. This series is truly the result of genius on the production team&#039;s part.<br />
A huge 10 on enjoyment from me. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I highly recommend this series to anyone. Any anime viewer, wither they liked mysteries or horror previously or not. This anime is a must see. <br />
A 10 overall.

    Tl;dr: Any possible potential this show had is ruined by the lack of scary scenes, cliched characters, utter dearth of character development and inconclusive ending. If you’re even remotely the critical thinker type, this will not be an enjoyable experience. 4 out of 10 stars.<br />
<br />
This show was something that a friend used to really be into circa 2007. I recently remembered it out of nowhere and decided to check it out -- figured a MAL rating of close to 8 couldn’t be that bad, could it. Boy, was I wrong, and HOW.<br />
<br />
Let’s start off with the horror aspect. There is none. Out of 25 episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242464">
        I was scared for a grand total of two minutes in one episode. Even setting aside the facts that the spooks were intended for a younger audience, the stories themselves weren’t creepy or scary or even absorbing. The only reason things could be considered spooky is cheap jump scares, with the exception of the two minutes I mentioned. The music builds up to scary moments, but is let down by the mediocre visuals. The arcs (cases) last for 4-5 episodes, which is something I don’t mind since it prevents binging.<br />
<br />
This is a typical shoujo anime, which means a romance between the lead pair is inevitable. My issue here is that there is no real indicator that the guy even likes the girl or favours her. She has slight ESP and her subconscious chooses to send messages to her in the form of the guy - but that’s in her head. So to be clear, she falls for the guy (pretty quickly, I might add) for no discernible reason, doesn’t bother to differentiate her idea of the guy from the person himself (again, they have little interaction except when she’s ordered around by him) and thinks that because she is attracted to him, it gives her some kind of claim on him. FYI, it doesn’t. Mutual consent is important, girls.<br />
<br />
The guy is very pretty and very smart, but I don’t know enough of him beyond that to say anything. He’s seventeen, runs a psychic detective agency, does his own thing, whatever. He’s so unimpressive that I don’t miss his presence at all. It has been hinted at that he is the Quiet Boy with Unfathomable Emotional Depths, but that is never elaborated upon.<br />
<br />
As for the protagonist herself, I have to say this - she’s just plain dumb. When you’ve been handling paranormal cases for a while now, hearing a child say they’re sad someone is alive is a pretty good indicator that they’re possessed. She’s supposed to be the “heart” of the team (because girls are emotional, of course!) but that’s not the issue - it’s that she feels bad for everything and everyone and refuses to be practical. She leaves people alone when told not to leave them alone. She does things she’s told not to because of her feelings. At the same time, the guy (who’s her boss in a way) refuses to divulge plans with her for no reason and then expects her to not question him, which puts them at odds. So not only is every outburst of hers irritating to watch, it’s also invalidated by the guy in the end, and she ends up apologizing even though it’s partly his fault. I hate their dynamic; can you tell?<br />
<br />
Leaving aside the protagonists, the side characters are likeable enough but it’s pathetic how they don’t develop through two cours. There’s an older (20s) lady who seems somewhat flirtatious (we know she’s a vamp because she wears lipstick) and there’s a younger girl the protagonists’ age who also helps with their cases. I’m happy to add that the protag and this girl don’t hesitate to help each other even though they’re rivals for the main guy’s lurrve, so that’s nice. The character I most like is the monk (who moonlights as a rock star? But leave that aside) since he acts like a responsible adult and looks out for the protagonist. But none of the characters are elaborated on beyond mentioning things in passing and never returning to them. It’s frustrating and disappointing, because the side cast have decent interactions and are fairly likeable.<br />
<br />
The worst part of the series, though, is its callous handling of death. The crew don’t seem terribly upset even when the paranormal incidences lead to deaths of their clients; they don’t seem fearful or nervous at the risk to their lives. Along the with open ending of the series (which leads to stuff in the last arc being unexplained), it makes for a very disappointing watch. My chief emotion when it finished was regret at wasting ten hours of my life on this show. That should tell you enough.

    Ghost hunt. <br />
Pretty attractive name for those looking for some horror anime. Well, you might not completely be in the blood/gore/heart attacks section but you&#039;ll definitely regret if you choose to leave it.<br />
It is quite a unique anime. The series is not a typical fantasy/thriller horror. It infact, shows &#039;ghost hunting&#039; by means of technology and modern day equipment and ofcourse, the old purification and chanting ways are included too.<br />
<br />
The series does not have a main plot. There are small arcs which usually don&#039;t last for more than 3-4 episodes thus not dragging the anime and neither taking away the viewer&#039;s attention. Every arc is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19052">
        beautifully executed and more haunting than its predecessor. Ofcourse, most of the time, you&#039;ll be hearing the handsome and narcisstic Naru&#039;s theories and calculations, but the anime does have its moments. At the begining, you may not be impressed, but then you&#039;ll find that you can hardly watch the horror parts with the lights switched off and no one around. I&#039;d started having hallucination when I did that. Every mystery has a back story and side characters and the occasional history of ghost huntings/vampires/curses explained is quite a wonderful addition. Every arc is sure to keep you guessing and hanging at the edge of your seats.<br />
<br />
The art was a little problematic. The animation was a little choppy, probably due to budget. But nevertheless, you&#039;ll be so thoroughly engrossed in the story that you won&#039;t notice it much. The characters are designed well though.<br />
<br />
The sounds department takes all the glory for the goosebumps. Those rantings and bashings and screams and wails, the closing doors, the breaking glass, they never failed to give me a cardiac arrest. Excellent job on the sound effects. I&#039;d have given it a 10 had the opening and closing themes been more than just instrumentals but, nevertheless, they suit the mood perfectly.<br />
<br />
Characters are another major highlight of the series. There are around 6 main psychics who&#039;re on the mystery jobs. Each has their own personality, tastes and fields of profession. The most notable ones being Mai and Naru, you&#039;ll love the other characters too. The comical scenes, their interactions with each other and the parts where you go &#039;wow, they&#039;re so cool&#039; are all worth it. Though sometimes you&#039;ll wish Mai would just shut up or Naru should stop being an ass. In my opinion, some characters like Lin and Naru as well, should have had a more detailed exploration of their pasts and personalities shown. However, realistic, well designed and extemely likeable characters is a win point for Ghost HUnt.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Every moment is worth it. Every funny scene will not fail to make you laugh out loud. Every horror part will instill you with chills and speed up your heart rate. The chemistry between Naru and Mai will keep you wanting more and more.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
An excellent series which I happened to pick randomly and am very glad I did. The ending could have answered a few more questions and relationships could have progressed further, but it&#039;s a job well done. Highly recommended if you adore the horror genre as well as some good and serious fun. Just make sure you don&#039;t turn off the lights!

    Ghost Hunt&#039;s backstory and setups of how the various supernatural forces operate are well done, as well as the actual mysteries they are involved in. However, what distracted its best qualities are the forced relationships and relying on predictable tropes to advance plot elements. My impression is that Ghost Hunter may have been altered to cater to target audiences by dumbing down the plot and dialog at some points, but when the actual investigation storyline calls for complex explanations and logic, the characters inexplicably gains 200 points in IQ to figure everything out.<br />
<br />
Case in point: after almost a year working for ghost hunter experts, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review161183">
        main protagonist was told they there were two children of the family being investigated were behaving strangely, and when she meets them, they are constantly repeating about they wish how their relatives would die. While it&#039;s obvious to the audience they are possessed, the protagonist is completely oblivious to this possibility until the plot conveniently calls for that moment later on for dramatic effect. Better options would have been to make their possessed personalities less black and white or simply not mention these kids beforehand. Throughout the series contain very poorly implemented scenarios of a) main characters become oblivious to obvious clues, b) withholding key information (i.e., the girl has ESP, gets a vision but doesn&#039;t tell anyone about it until the 3rd act) c) unconvincing situations forcing characters to become alone or in danger and d) overtly reliant in chibi style comedy to excuse logic gaps.<br />
<br />
The culmination of these effects ultimately makes the main protagonist Mai a every unpleasant character. She&#039;s supposed to be the everyday girl, but is stupid while the story needs other plot elements to take shape, super-talented and powerful when when the story calls for a solution, overdramatic to force tension between her and her friends, and is somehow excused from her ignorance because she&#039;s supposed to be &#039;just like us&#039;.<br />
<br />
But this is somewhat bearable, since the actual cases they are investigating are truly well fascinating. What made them great was that we cared about the people involved in the cases, we were sympathetic to their plight. Unfortunately, the series gradually moved away into 2-dimensional antagonists and threats in order &#039;power-up&#039; the main characters.<br />
<br />
I was interested enough about the case to bypass the faults in order to find out the resolutions. But really, I just wish they were confident enough in their core story to not have to throw in these cliches to appeal to young kids. I wish the main characters were competent, mature, present their relationships with subtlety, so that I don&#039;t have scream at my laptop at that the main culprit is the teacher and not the girl while the characters are wasting my time.<br />

    Ghost Hunt is another anime that I randomly picked just for the sake of it. Ghost Hunt is a 2006 anime adapted from a series of novels that started back in 1989. Unlike most adaptations, Ghost Hunt is not a direct one. While both of them keep the same characters and the same background, the novels were actually oriented towards young girl (shoujo) while the anime tends itself toward young male audience or perhaps a mix audience. Ghost Hunt was actually a nice find at first. The anime started fluidly and was very interesting at first. However, almost everything that made it enjoyable was lost

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26931">
        in the second half of the show. What started as a mystery/supernatural anime slowly became action-oriented. What is really the right choice?<br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt, in a nutshell, tells the story of our main character Mai and her everyday life in her new job of ghost hunter. The anime is actually couples of short stories that aren’t necessarily attached together or directly follows one after another. Looking at the story arcs, if you forget about the silly and forgettable characters relations and their everyday life, these ghost stories are actually quite interesting in the first half. I find it quite interesting that Ghost Hunt actually bases itself on historic event to make these stories more credible. Even if some of those historic even are fictionally, one can actually draw a parallel between other works of fictions or even popular urban legends. Now, I have to say that the first half of the show is what you would actually expect from a supernatural anime involving ghosts. Poltergeists, unexplainable phenomena and a slow pace story is what Ghost Hunt offered at first. Sadly, after the Christmas Arc, which is the best arc of the series, everything went downhill. Somehow, Ghost Hunt thought it would be better if it went into more of an action anime and overly-cliché melodramatic moments. It doesn`t get any better actually. The more you advance, the less mysterious Ghost Hunt feels and it is right at the end that Ghost Hunt killed it for me. Even though the second half was bad, it does not mean the enjoyment is completely gone and one might actually still enjoy the second half as much. All in all, the story started slightly predictable and became something very predictable.  <br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt does not offer a memorable cast; in fact it is probably the worst aspect of the show. Don`t get me wrong, the characters aren`t actually bad and they pretty much fit the enjoyment of the show. However, these characters aren`t well written are even less original. How often can you see Shibuya`s personality in anime? Quite a few actually, and this goes to the others as well. Beside the lack of being unique, these characters don`t have a complex personality and are often feels empty. The anime tends to develop characters relation, but in the end goes to nothing more than the starting case. That was a bit irritating for me. <br />
<br />
The art is actually very fluid and very good. From old shrines, to an abandoned building and passing by to a mansion, the settings and art reminds the viewer that ghost hunt is or wants to be a supernatural anime. Also, while Ghost Hunt is not scary at all, nor that it is very gory, it can actually be very bloody when the moments arrive (even though it is most of the time cheesy). The character design is quite distinct and well made. There is nothing much more to say about it.<br />
<br />
The music of Ghost Hunt is the best aspect of the show. Composed by Toshio Masuda who is popular for having composed the music of Naruto (even though his best work remains with Mushishi), the music is a perfect blend of effectiveness and simplicity that never goes over the top. Ghost Hunt Opening Song is one of the few songs that I wouldn`t mind listening to, probably because it is not another irritating j-pop song. Voice acting is very good. I’m not someone who can critics voice acting very well, but I know when they`re bad. <br />
<br />
To conclude, Ghost Hunt is one of those anime that is a nice find and that you actually watch just for the sake of it. I have to say that while being fairly good, Ghost Hunt does not live itself as one of the greatest anime I have seen and is still very far away from very good. I’d recommend this anime for everyone who is looking for a mystery anime that isn’t complex or very dark. <br />

    An anime mixed with two Hs, horror and humour.<br />
<br />
When i started watching this anime, my first impression was &amp;quot;it doesnt look as promising as the title&amp;quot;, as i didnt find it scary at all. With that, I was quite tempted to hold it. But anyway, i cont&#039;ed and much thanks to that, the stories behind just grow on me. Though it is abit draggy at the front, but as the anime progresses, each hunt is more dangerous than the others, with increasing suspense and scary factor.Characters wise, it is quite funny to see them attacking each other verbally, and how they bond togther, not forgetting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2393">
        the little romance in the show. =D<br />
<br />
A great show for ppl who are in for horror/scary/ghost genre.<br />
<br />
PS: try watching it in the middle of the night, with no lights on. I tried it and nearly scared myself to &#039;death&#039; at some eps.

    I love Ghost Hunt, have loved it and always will!<br />
<br />
This is my second time watching the series. The first was around 5 or 6 years ago and back then, I&#039;ve already decided that it&#039;s ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING ANIME that I&#039;ve watched in my entire life. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t usually watch anime series of supernatural  genre (although Supernatural is my favorite US TV show) so I only pick those which are really worth my time. Ghost Hunt along with XXXholic remain to be the shows that can give me GENUINE SCARES all the time. I love to watch these shows at night but THEY

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100321">
        ARE TOO DAMN SCARY that I can&#039;t help but to minimize my VLC screen so the effect wont be that overwhelming..fufufufu..<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like gory/bloody scary shows so the tolerable suspense atmosphere of Ghost Hunt suits my taste best. The show gives you the comfortable feeling you long for when you are trying to relax, and gives you an assurance that there is still hope for the ANIME INDUSTRY. The scare, the thrill, the suspense, the rom-com, the youthful aura and the drama - ingredients for a truly enjoyable show which fortunately GHOST HUNT has. <br />
<br />
As per the story, it is very simple. A group of supernatural experts gather around to solve supernatural mysteries. So simple yet the cases were nothing but ordinary! The stories of each mystery were delivered in the best scaaarry way possible. The sound and the music amplified the atmosphere to give you a series of pure scare fun and entertainment. <br />
<br />
The characters were ALL likable. Naru-chan and Mai, the two main leads, I remember back then how I got crazy for these characters and until now I still feel the same. Also, Mai is one of my favorite heroines ever!!!Aside from these two, all the characters were superb and well-blended with the story. Even though their personalities and abilities were well presented, they do not outshine the cases they worked on. The stories/cases were after all the heart of the series and fortunately these were executed magnificently.<br />
<br />
And what a lame scary show it would be if the sound and music were not that effective. Here at Ghost Hunt, you will not only be rewarded with good stories but with A SUPER GREAT MUSICAL EXPERIENCE too. The OP &amp; ED are cool and the BGMs are simply haunting!<br />
<br />
The BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT I can say about this show is that it only lasted for 25 episodes. This number is not enough to know the characters better and to solve the biggest mystery of this anime. Having said this, Ghost Hunt is truly an enjoyable series. SCARY+ ENTERTAINING = PURE FUN. You don&#039;t need LOGIC to understand and love this series. It just needs your creative mind for it to be appreciated. Although this is kind of an old series, it will always remain to be one of the MOST UNDERRATED SERIES OF ALL TIME. This is waaay better than new titles these days and I can&#039;t find a recent series that is a match with Ghost Hunt (recommendation anyone?). It is just sad that it wasn&#039;t that popular enough to gain a second season ( or was this the reason??). But anyway, there&#039;s still the manga if you want to continue the series, right? <br />
<br />
Overall, this series is SUPER RECOMMENDED, especially to those who are bored and looking for some SCARES and THRILLS. Watch this right now, but I suggest to try it at night for a better viewing experience..tee hee!<br />

    The story started out well for me, but to be honest it wasn&#039;t good enough to keep me interested for long. The problem with an anime like this is that there are hardly any common threads throughout each episode block. Every 3 or so episodes features its own storyline and while that may work for a title such as Jigoku Shoujo there is no balance between character development and plot to really engage the viewer. We hardly learn anything about the characters besides there occupation outside &amp;quot;ghost busting&amp;quot;. And the female lead seemed too naive, which is pretty ironic seeing as that was the only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5100">
        thing that kept her character remotely interesting. In the end, I watched 15 episodes and then skipped around a bit to see if things were getting interesting&amp;hellip;they didn&amp;rsquo;t. After that I skipped right to the final episode just to see what happens in the final scene, that was about the extend of my interest.<br />
<br />
The art work was reasonably good all the character models were well drawn and diverse. However, outside the ghost scenes the scenery was a little bland, nothing remarkable here.<br />
<br />
The intro song was what initially grabbed me, it was haunting yet enchanting at the same time, but also made the anime way more appealing then it actually was. As for the BGM... to be honest I can&#039;t really recall much, but that goes to show you how much of an impression it made on me... very little.<br />
<br />
The characters were actually quite appealing with the exception of the female lead and the male lead&#039;s sibling. The rest of the cast had very colorful personalities and made you wish that the female lead would just die and be replaced by one of the other female cast members. The female lead&#039;s personality could be characterized as foolish, bland, and naive. The male lead&#039;s brother could have just as easily been written out. He served no real purpose and was just there to prevent this series from becoming a harem anime.<br />
<br />
I guess the enjoyment factor was there for the first 15 episodes then it became a complete bore. The characters weren&#039;t engaging enough, and the plot simply wasn&#039;t good enough to support the lack of character development.<br />
<br />
Overall I would say this is a C grade anime that just isn&amp;rsquo;t fascinating enough to keep the viewer enthralled.<br />

    I love this anime, reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Each episode is full of mystery, i have no idea whats going to happen next, and it&#039;s fun to try and unravel the mystery.<br />
<br />
2) Some of the scenes are really tense, my heart was pounding so fast- some of it was really scary.<br />
<br />
3) I liked how Mai&#039;s powers grew throughout the series.<br />
<br />
4) Hmmmm...I liked Naru-chan although he was annoying in some episodes.<br />
<br />
5) If ya like supernatural, mystery, horror, etc...u will love this.<br />
<br />
6) Some parts in episodes are super scary ( well thats what i think) i actually screamed and nearly fell off my chair, but then after the fright i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335">
        actually find it quite funny.<br />
<br />
What I didn&#039;t find so hot about the anime:<br />
<br />
1) The ending was kind of a let down, mainly because i thought the anime should of carried on for longer as there were still some mysteries left unsolved.<br />
<br />
2) Damn it...i really wanted to see Naru and Mai get together :( <br />
<br />
3) Mai...she should really try harder...sometimes she lets herself down<br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt:<br />
The characters are great and the storyline are imaginative, scary and funny. Overall i would recommend this to everyone accept from the faint hearted T.T lol. If you like magical powers, ghosts, fight scenes, mysteries, and a dash of fun humour you would lurrrrrrv this

    GHOST HUNT was actually a difficult anime series to watch. It is a series of ghost hunts broken down into chapters. Typically, four episodes make up each chapter. The first chapter had a slow predictable plot and unremarkable characters, so I stopped watching. Later, on a whim, I went back and started watching again. The second chapter&#039;s writing was so much better, and the stories kept providing great jump scares! Plus, through developments, the characters started to come to life, making me care more about their plight. So, all in all, I was glad I gave GHOST HUNT a second chance.

    Okay, everyone has seen that T.V Series called Ghoster Hunter right?? <br />
<br />
Well, let&#039;s just say that &amp;quot;Ghost Hunt&amp;quot; is just about the same thing, but 10X&#039;s cooler and freakier. I&#039;m so wrapped up just from watching it. &amp;gt;&amp;lt; I wished I didn&#039;t see it at night. FRIKIN DOLLS!!! Argh, this is a great series filled with suspense and drama and just watching the first episode you have to now what will happen next. The cast of characters are all so colorful and I enjoy them very much. MOSTLY NARU THE NARCISSIST!!! &amp;lt;3 I love that nickname Mai gave him. ^^ You got to watch this,and

    If you wanna get scared, entertained and learn at the same time, this anime is definitely a must-see! Ghost Hunt lives up to its name, delivering an effective plot that will leave you glued to your seat. It has that perfect mix of scariness and humor, with characters that makes the story come alive. Some parts where they explain psychic phenomenons are interesting, as well as an insight on japanese occult. There are several humorous situations as well, the episodes are well-written, making you scream at one time and laugh at the next. The opening theme is pretty cool too, kinda reminds you of that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2132">
        classic opening in twilight zone. Too bad it was never completed. Hopefully there&#039;ll be a sequel to Ghost Hunt, since there are a lot of questions left to be answered particularly naru&#039;s identity and mai&#039;s feeling for him.

    Ghost Hunt is a supernatural mystery series from Fuyumi Ono, the creator of Twelve Kingdoms and Shiki. Like most of its genre, show that plays on people&#039;s fascination with the eerie and unknown: haunted houses, poltergeists, possessions, etc. to draw its audience in and spook them. What sets it apart as better than a lot of its kin is mostly in its execution, but also Ono&#039;s knack of using myths and superstitions to build strong mythos in her stories.<br />
<br />
The show consists of loosely connected supernatural cases follows Mai Taniyama, a high school girl who works part time for paranormal investigator Kazuya Shibuya, better known as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76255">
        &quot;Naru&quot; (telling you why would ruin some of the fun), and several associates of theirs in the paranormal investigation business. Every story arc starts simply enough: Naru, Mai, and the others have a case brought to them; they begin to investigate and speculate the circumstances of the case. The real fun starts when strange, and often dangerous supernatural occurrences begin to happen. And it is not just because weird things are happening, although that certainly is a big factor. Much of the fun comes from watching the characters try to make sense of what is happening. Each of the characters comes with their own theories steeped in mythology and paranormal studies. This gives the show certain unpredictability, and a quality reminiscent to a who-done-it mystery; only involving supernatural forces rather than people. The person watching is trying just as hard to figure out what is going on as the characters in the show.<br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt also has a nice balance of the comical and the macabre. The show&#039;s comedy is mostly dependent on character gags: Naru&#039;s aloof personality and narcissism are often played for laughs, Mai&#039;s crush on him and her somewhat air-headed personality are played for laughs, and all the characters have silly quirks to giggle at. It is a simple but effective approach; executed with spunk, enthusiasm, and some solid comedic timing. The comedy is mostly there to fill up the show&#039;s downtime between all the creepy and mysterious stuff, but it is entertaining all on its own. The creepier parts of the show are done just as competently. Wrathful spirits, ominous prophetic dreams, and deadly curses are a plenty;  though admittedly they are more spooky than terrifying. However, there are some genuinely air-raising moments especially in the latter episodes. The &quot;Bloodstained Labyrinth&quot; in particular has a horrifying sequence in which it seems a central character is about to be killed, and an equally as scarey sequence in its finale.<br />
<br />
The characters are a fun bunch, but kind of lax in their characterization. They all certainly have distinct character traits, but their personalities fall into a similar pattern to many other anime, and don&#039;t feel completely developed.Unfortunately, this is especially true for Naru, a character so surrounded by mystery that he should be more interesting than he is. The problem is that he isn&#039;t developed to his full potential, you get the feeling that there is a lot under his cold exterior, but you never see as much of it as you want. There is a warmer, friendlier version of him that appears in Mai&#039;s prophetic dreams, but this isn&#039;t as explored as it needs to be either. Majority of the cast lacks in complexity, falling into archetypes such as the laid-back monk Houshou Takigawa being the big brother figure of the group, and Masako being a love rival to Mai for Naru; though they are all quite likeable. The characters do work quite well as an ensemble connected by their relationships with Mai, who is a deserving lead, being the most developed and likeable of the cast.<br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt was produced by J.C. Staff, and is a respectable effort from the studio. Character designs are a bit on the generic side, but that isn&#039;t too much of a detriment as they prove to be just fine for the show and stay on model. The background is similarly good, perhaps even better because they often support the show&#039;s spooky atmosphere very well. The soundtrack is suitable in both the light comedic moments and the more intriguing scenes as the mystery unfolds. However, it is the most effective during the show&#039;s creepy moments, especially the screeching violins that play when things are at their most intense. There isn&#039;t really unconventional in the show&#039;s technical execution, but its tried-and-true method is done very well.<br />
<br />
Ghost Hunt&#039;s story arcs connect together sort of like an overarching story, but never get that kind of cohesion. As a result it feels somewhat incomplete, although it ends on a fairly satisfying note. That and the simple characterizations does harm the show a little. However, these flaws are easily overshadowed because that show is just so much spooky fun. The story arcs are generally well constructed, and the show does a remarkable job juggling tonally between creepy and funny. All in all, this is one of the better, and doubtless one of the most fun, supernatural mystery shows out there.

<br />
When I started watching Ghost Hunt, I really didn&#039;t know what to expect. Up until then, I hadn&#039;t seen a series that could literally &quot;scare&quot; me. Other so-called horror series like Elfen Lied or Hellsing never even made me budge. I&#039;m not saying those aren&#039;t good series ( Elfen is one of my favorites), but they didn&#039;t really live up to the horror part.<br />
The characters very pretty good. John was really funny at times, Monk was the cool guy, and Mai was kind of annoying; but they did their job at keeping the show really entertaining.<br />
Favorite character is Monk. I remember the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19619">
        lady with the broom-like spiritual incantation-stuff really bored / annoyed me. She was way too cocky, and while her silly prayers never seemed to do anything, she was still acting all high and mighty. I really hate that kind of characters in anime, as they bore me to death. They&#039;re more dull and annoying than the I Rate Gamer. Well, maybe not really that annoying, but still...<br />
My only complaint (and a big one) would be that the series ended like utter crap. No real solid ending, just a funny picture of the group waiting for Kazuya to get better.Pretty inconclusive if you&#039;d ask me. I&#039;ve been waiting for a sequel for years, hoping they&#039;d make the ending clearer with it, but it&#039;s not really coming out, is it... <br />
<br />
=-= Art =-=<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t remember much about the art, the drawing style, effects and the likes because I&#039;ve seen Ghost Hunt more than two years ago. But, seeing how the series is pretty recent, I don&#039;t think there are major issues to be addressed here. It wasn&#039;t bad and it wasn&#039;t outstanding. It just was.<br />
If there were any major flaws in the &quot;art department&quot; I&#039;m sure I would&#039;ve remembered them. I loved the eerie backgrounds in the episode with the creepy, bloody hallway. That was the one that really scared me.<br />
I also liked it when there was a scary moment, and they&#039;d show up each character&#039;s face in picture-in-picture -like squares. That was pretty cool.<br />
But the fact that there are almost no scans of Ghost Hunt on the web doesn&#039;t really help either. Sadly, It&#039;s one of those series that there are zero to five wallpapers, and one to twenty scans. You can&#039;t really find many Ghost Hunt resources and stuff on the internet. :-L<br />
<br />
=-= Sound =-=<br />
<br />
The intro...one of the best intros I&#039;ve ever seen. It didn&#039;t show any of the characters, as most series do in their openings. The music in it was freaky as sh*t, the weird floating lights, the faceless hooded silhouette that was gradually approaching the screen, with a fiery background and GHOSTS FLOATING EVERYWHERE, THE DARK AND WEIRD RUINS, THE WHITE FLASHES, THE CREVASSE, THE SCARY ORCHESTRA-LIKE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING ! How can it get more awesome and freaky than that? When I was watching the tenth episode or so ( don&#039;t really remember that well. it was about halfway in the series anyway), the opening started and, my cousin, was in the same room with me and she said : &quot;what&#039;s with the freaky music?&quot;.<br />
John&#039;s accent owned, by the way. The japanese voicing was generally good, except for Kazuya sounding like a smart a** know-it-all. He was a tad annoying at times; reminded me of Rei from NGE; the difference being that Rei isn&#039;t annoying. I can&#039;t say anything about the english dub, though; I don&#039;t watch any dubbed anime.<br />
Also, just because of the awesome opening, I&#039;m gonna ignore the fact that the ending sucked :d<br />
<br />
=-= Overall =-=<br />
<br />
It may be because horror series (and generally horror stuff) are my favorites, or because of the simple, to the point name of it, but Ghost Hunt was one of the most enjoyable and appealing series to me.<br />
I watched it on the dvd-player so I there was plenty of space for me to get under the blanket, close my eyes and sing some Mika with my ears plugged when I got scared. Just kidding :)) it wasn&#039;t that scary. OR...was it? O.O<br />
I appreciated the fact that there were no &quot;classic-sucky-style ghosts&quot;. You know, those white silhouettes that looked like my grandma with a white sheet covering her. They portrayed poltergeists, ghost-dogs, restless spirits, a possessed doll and all that stuff in a way that you could tell was fantasy, but wasn&#039;t that far from reality either. Something like those documentaries you see on Discovery about &quot;the other world&quot;. And I have to say I enjoy those a lot.<br />
Anyway, great series,great soundtrack, good characters and crappy ending.

    This is one of those rare anime you&#039;ve never heard of, and wish you had.<br />
<br />
What it is on the surface: school kids and random weirdos fighting and hunting ghosts.  What it really is: interesting, creepy, charming character driven work that slowly builds up tension to the last few episodes.<br />
<br />
Mai is a girl who accidentally breaks the camera equipment of Kazuya--a ghost hunting mystic. Kazuya uses this as an opportunity to hire her as a gopher for his paranormal research agency who consults various mystics and spiritual mediums (from a monk who&#039;s hardly ascetic to a priestess who seems a total fraud).<br />
<br />
The story takes an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14412">
        interesting revisionist view of the paranormal--attempting to debunk the existence of ghosts by scientific means to the existence real, and scary paranormal occurences (usually inspired by true events in Japanese and European history) which is also where the show gets its mixed spirituality from. <br />
<br />
It starts out mundane and harmless enough and keeps raising the stakes as the threat and ghosts become real and honestly the atmosphere and audio actually make the show have a very nervous and scary feel to it--without ever having to rely on gore or violence. There&#039;s a good blend of comedy and clashing personalities and Mai and Kazuya are good characters--even if the supporting cast is not that original, although they are all given a chance to shine and a human element in the final few episodes.<br />
<br />
A few filler episodes and stumbles here and there take away from a perfect score, but this is still worth watching.

    The art of ghost hunting is always beautiful if the story goes right. Ghost Hunt proved that statement and showed me the feelings I have lost ever since I began watching Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. <br />
<br />
Story : 10/10 <br />
<br />
The story&#039;s very simple! Ghost hunting, and that&#039;s about it! <br />
<br />
But one may question why such simplicity could become 10/10. Well. I can&#039;t really explain it. But it just is. It&#039;s like how any dish could taste better if it was put in a more luxury plate.  <br />
<br />
Art : 10/10<br />
<br />
I hesitated to watch this anime because the thumbnail looks like some kind of oldschool crap from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329770">
        the 90s. After watching the anime, I am now proud to say that I was wrong. In fact, I was surprised that the art, animation and quality for this anime was actually very good for an anime from 2006. <br />
<br />
Sound : 10/10<br />
<br />
Oh the sound&#039;s one of the best thing about this show. It adds even more tense into scenes, making them become more thrilling, and most importantly, the opening is fucking awesome. I never skipped it because listening to it sounds like I&#039;m about to enter a realm of awesomeness that could never be forgotten. <br />
<br />
Character : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Some characters are qualified to be retarded because they&#039;ve been plagued by the salt and toxicity of this genre so-called &quot;drama&quot;. However, the majority of them are likable and I don&#039;t really mind the retarded ones that much since the story makes up for it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Probably nearly as comparable or as comparable to Dusk Maiden of Amnesia on its prime. Very fun. <br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10 <br />
<br />
You must read the manga after watching this show to get the full experience. If you don&#039;t then you&#039;d probably give this show at least a 9 at best since it was left as a cliffhanger. <br />
<br />
Overall, the show was fun and I enjoyed watching it. It&#039;s very nice to have something like this once in a while.

    First off what annoyed me of the series.  Really it wasn&#039;t much other than with how the mini arc were set up it just didn&#039;t feel like you really knew any of the characters much better at the end of the series compared to when you first had them all dropped in your lap.  I craved to know more so badly while watching and perhaps that was the hook that keeps you watching.  It seemed like in each arc you got one more tid bit about a character.  For example in this arc you learn the monk is also in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15745">
        band and that was pretty much all the character development you got for the next 3-4 episodes.<br />
<br />
What I loved about the series is that it kept me interested throughout and while I don&#039;t feel cheated by the ending it leaves me wanting more.  The art and character designs were both good.  The seiyuu choices were very fitting.  <br />
<br />
As a final and probably most telling part.  I will be adding this one to the collection.

    There was a time, when i thought the only way for an anime to spook me, was to make my skin crawl from watching grotesque scenes, like in When They Cry; or see gruteous amounts of blood and body parts sent flying like in Elfen Lied. However this series, when you get down to it, can make you stand on the edge of your seat. This is probaly one of the few series i have seen where after watching a few couple of episodes, i wanted to turn some lights on.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is rather simplitic enough, focusing on a group of rather diverse people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30423">
        who hunt ghosts, and the plot of the story is put into mostly arcs which takes 3 to 4 episodes to finish. After each arc, the cases gets more dangerous than the last. The advantage of the tool of using 3 to 4 episode arcs, is that it doesn&#039;t become a rather overabundace of monster of the week epiodes. Sure it probably would&#039;ve been great to see more cases of the SPR, but it probably would&#039;ve taken out what makes the series so unique, its charactorization, supsense as well as its humor. The biggest drawback this series has against it, is that they hardly go into main characters backstories, and also there isn&#039;t  really a conclusion. For that, i give the story an 8. <br />
<br />
Art: Art is above average, main characters are not so detailed yet very simple designs, however even simple designs can be effective as i can see the shading of these characters making them stand out. I also commemorate the art on the ghost designs especially one of the designs in episode 21 where it gave me very good chills. So i give art a good 9<br />
<br />
Sound: Now this is what makes a series or breaks it, if you don&#039;t have the right sounds or music for the right scenes or moments, then simply its not good. But this is where this series shines the most and i give it a well deserve 10, as it more than surpasses my expectation of good timing of music, and the right mood of music. This series does a great job executing the suspecful music and the eerie music that makes you more alert.  The Opening gives you the sense of what is to come and what to expect  and the Ending is also worth a listen due that its rather unusual way to end as series. Listening to the Ending for the first time i thought it didn&#039;t fit, but after watching more episodes and learning chemistry of characters and plot development it dawns that it really fits than first thought.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters are rather unique to the show, and the chemistry they have is just so...right.  You&#039;ll see what I mean when I start doing a listing off their psychological profile heres. First up to bat is Kazuya Shibuya the main male lead, very self confident and a self consious boy who is known by a nickname as Naru, which in short for Narsccistic, which certainly fits his character as time and time again he is proven to be right. We have a rockstar buddish monk, who has a large fanbase of girls. A priest who is Austrailian, and you have a shinto priestess who many people in the group make fun of her for bragging that she can cleans spirits, but fails to do so. Last and certainly not least, a young high school girl who because of circumstances is force to help the team. Bring all these aspects together, you got a very unique humor to pave for some lightheartness.  For the originality of the characters i give it a 9<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This series is certainly going to give you the run of your money and is one of the few series that i love to watch again, and again, and again despite knowing what will happen and why. Replay value is priceless, however, i felt some things could&#039;ve been done better, sorta wish the series had a slight longer run if only to have as I will say again, a slight conclusive ending, however the way it ended isnt bad, leaves it open ended. I award enjoyment with a nine.<br />
<br />
Overall: Overall this series is something people should at least watch for four episodes before deciding to quiet it. So when you people decide to watch it, i will dare you to watch it at night with the lights off, and the sound not cranck up all the way but enough so you can hear the slightest whisper, especially from episode 18- 21. Rating for Overall i award a 9<br />
