    I have watched the entire season of this 4 times and have not found myself bored once.<br />
<br />
The overall story line of this anime starts a bit stereotypical, but the development is excellent.<br />
Not to mention that the main character is an overall bad ass with a kind, although a little too innocent, heart.<br />
<br />
Although sometimes a little cliche, this anime is found very enjoyable and one is left with other regret there is not more of it!<br />
<br />
As a personal bit: WAHANLY IS THE BEST! :P

    *SPOILERS*<br />
Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari was my first time watching an OVA series that comes out every month rather than every week. As such, I was not prepared for the gnawing impatience I felt at the end of every episode. <br />
<br />
At first I wasn&#039;t really absorbed with this series and just started watching it while waiting for one of my downloads to finish. However as the1st episode progressed, I slowly found myself getting drawn into the story. The basic storyline wasn&#039;t anything new. It had the same premises as some other fantasy series with the main character getting thrown into an unknown world in order to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29757">
        fight the villain. However the other elements of the series helped bring the story to life.<br />
<br />
I thought that the art was very well done and really brought out the attractive aspects of nature and the wild. While watching Kenshi out in the open, I found myself wishing to be in his shoes in order to feel the wind in my face and the grass beneath my feet. <br />
<br />
The op and ed for this series wasn&#039;t anything too special. Both pieces of music fit the series and was enjoyable to listen to. However they weren&#039;t anything people would go nuts about. The voice acting for this series was well done. All the voice actors brought their characters to life and carried the characters&#039; feeling across to the viewer.<br />
<br />
Being of the harem genre, the female characters were very diverse in terms of personality and looks. However unlike other harem series, I actually found myself liking all of the main female cast. Many series have at least one female lead who I just can&#039;t stand, whether it&#039;s because they&#039;re all whiny because they can&#039;t get their feelings across or because they&#039;re insecure about themselves. In this series I found myself laughing at all the comedic situations between the female characters and Kenshi and didn&#039;t find myself displeased one bit.<br />
<br />
Kenshi was also another reason why I enjoyed this series. (Maybe it&#039;s because I recently started watching School Days and quickly got tired of Makoto&#039;s unappealing character.) Anyhow I really enjoyed Kenshi&#039;s confident and bright personality. He started out in the story as a strong protagonist and ended the story as a strong protagonist. He didn&#039;t really have to grow in character because he was already a likable character from the beginning.<br />
<br />
With many harem series, I usually find myself cursing at the last episode if it ends in an open ending. However with this series I thought that the ending actually fit and didn&#039;t resent the producers for not choosing a concrete female lead for Kenshi to end up with. This is probably because romance was not the main point of the series. You could tell that many of the female cast had feelings for Kenshi but the way the story unfolded, you never really expected for Kenshi to become lovey doey. This series was mainly focused on the comedic situations between Kenshi and the other characters with the mecha fighting thrown in as a bonus.<br />
<br />
This series was very enjoyable for me to watch and I never felt like skipping ahead in any of the episodes. Rather, I felt that the episodes were too short as I wanted to see more of Kenshi. Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari was a great series for me and I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to watch it

    Seeing as how this was actually a forum post of mine when I went on a rant after watching this dreadful series, I wanted to bring this out to the front page and see what you&#039;re truly getting yourself into. <br />
<br />
This does contain some spoilers, but it will not impact the series in any way. Anyone who has not watched this should not have a problem with the spoilers as it does not reveal any plot twists, etc(except episode 1, but what the hell, it&#039;s episode one haha).<br />
<br />
The graphics and battles were top notch. However, the entire series was literally a land fill of fillers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42447">
        all the way until at least episode 9. Episodes 2-9 were just Kenshi meeting girls and getting into harem themed situations. Granted the situations were funny at times, it got repetitive, dragged out and ultimately ruined the entire series for me. <br />
<br />
 All the plot holes also tested my patience with this anime. I never drop animes but this one seriously had me contemplating on it. An example would be why? Why is the Holy Island getting attacked? Because of your &#039;ideologies&#039;? Would you at least take some time to tell us instead of bombarding us with panties and breasts? Also, as would be expected, no one dies in this anime. They just keep on coming back and back and back and back.<br />
<br />
 Another one would be that the timing on the music is horrible. Though the music (BG music) itself is not bad, the timing is horrible. Did I just say that twice? Well let me say it again. The timing is absolutely horrible in this. I could tell when they tried to make a &#039;situation&#039; seem serious or dire only to be ruined by the music. An example of this would be on episode 13 when the students of the Holy Island are trying to take back the land. There&#039;s some fluffly music playing that could easily be used during one of Kenshi&#039;s Harem situations. Everyone is laughing and having a good time even though it&#039;s the last episode. Instead of laughing and smilling, at least try and keep a serious face.<br />
<br />
 I can say after finishing this OVA series that there was literally no character development. The only &#039;development&#039; I saw throughout were characters becoming tsundere and just becoming an outright harem. <br />
<br />
<br />
 For me, the only time this anime for me gave off a sense of seriousness was when Kenshi&#039;s seikijin went black and white and went berserk. That and in the beginning of episode 1 when Kenshi was on the swan trying to kill that princess. Not even the climax could be taken seriously. Kenshi wasn&#039;t even breathing hard during the final battle even though Gaia was many times stronger then him and he wasn&#039;t even trying his hardest until Chiaia threatens to take away his gems??? What the hell? He had a harder time compressing his sword then fighting Gaia. Mediocre until the very end.<br />
<br />
 After the Holy island is taken over, for some reason NO ONE cares that all their material possessions, everything they&#039;ve owned is being pillaged by the thieves and all they care about is catching Kenshi&#039;s attention and being infatuated with him. Completely ridiculous. I know this is an anime, but can you at least make an attempt in trying to make the situations they&#039;re in at least seem realistic, having some type of impact on the characters? <br />
<br />
 This anime, barely being able to keep my attention I may have skipped on some points but I&#039;m pretty sure I nailed the major flaws in this anime. Giving this anime even a 5 would be too much. I rated this a 2, which seems just about right when the plot is a complete mess, riddled with plot holes and too many fillers. I seriously can not recommend this to anyone. However, if you&#039;re into harems and don&#039;t give a damn about plots or character development, then go ahead and watch this train wreck of an anime.

    As a fan of Tenchi Muyo and its franchise, Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, would have to be if not the best spin-off that&#039;s come out to date. Bear in mind, my review will be very biased due to nostalgia playing a big part(having grown up to Tenchi anime instead of Pokemon or Dragonball)<br />

Whilst there are subtle references to the MC being part of the Tenchi Muyo universe(TenchiVerse), I doubt it would be enough for anyone to think that they would need to watch the past franchise before starting this series.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
The story itself is pretty generic and is about a boy who is summoned to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26970">
        a world not of his own with only his wits(and an inexhaustible amount of physical power) to help him find his way back home to Japan. One of the reasons why I&#039;ve taken a liking to this series is due to having the MC play an active role with this anime compared to his spin-off predecessors when it comes to the action. Of course not a lot of people will like MC due to how much he portrays as a Gary Stu being all perfect, but that doesn&#039;t really phase too much as I had found Kenshi to be very likable opposed to past harem stereotypes.<br />
<br />
Whilst there is an underlining plot of conspiracy and betrayal within Isekai, don&#039;t be alarmed if the imbalance throws you off from an  episode tense with drama and action to than randomly switch to fanservice as all-in-all like its previous spin-offs, the focus is heavily set on its harem/ecchi genre and all part of the humor. Although I should add for an OVA where its producers could have taken advantage to a lot more fanservice and nudity, I have to respect that they didn&#039;t, as to not ruin the main focus of the plot(lacking as it was).<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
As a fan of the franchise since the early 90&#039;s, I have never been one to critique their sense of animation &amp; design as it was usually the slap-stick comedy which had made me a TenchiVerse fan in the first place, so I was surprised and amazed with the improvement in animation since the time-gap with Tenchi Muyo GXP(last spin-off I had seen back in 2003). Although not a Miyazaki or Shinkai, Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is pretty well animated for its time.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Whilst most Tenchi Muyo anime have had an outstanding OST to back their series/OVA, unfortunately this is where I felt the series may have failed for me, which in turn eventuated  my score back to a 5. OP and ED were great in their own way, I felt it just did not match the vibe which this series portrayed and BGM at times did not suit some of the moods. But please don&#039;t let that turn you off from watching the series as this does not necessarily mean a bad thing(it could probably just be me feeling nostalgic to the franchises older OST). In regards to voice actors, as I had watched the whole series in its native language, I had felt they had picked the right seiyuus as each character played their part well without sounding out of place(unlike some anime that can make you cringe just from a character opening their mouth!).<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
With an original plot outside of the Tenchi Muyo universe, I felt the characters were molded very well to fit the scenarios and as mentioned, minimal references had been borrowed off the franchise for hardcore fans out there to conspire theories to their hearts content. (10pts going to whoever guesses the cameo in episode 4)<br />
Now for those who may have already seen this show or are half-way may think the show ranks of predictability and clichés but hey, in this day and age what anime doesn&#039;t? If you can&#039;t get past that part and enjoy the show for what it is, than it would be a waste of even watching it in the first place. Isekai doesn&#039;t try to be that next thing and is just there to be purely enjoyed (and which I believe they&#039;ve done well with).<br />
Whether the cast of girls can be classed as clichéd, I have to admit that they have been played well and their parts not as overused as what you&#039;d normally see from a typical harem cast(eg.the tsundere type that&#039;s too tsun-tsun or the love-love type who smothers the hero too much).<br />
While the cast is too many to mention(just check Wiki if you like to know more), what I will mention is that if you like your Gary Stu&#039;s(opposed to the uninspiring stereotype you get in harems), than you will definitely like this series as Kenshi is what you would call a one-man army with his exceptional skills whether they be domestic or on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and OverAll: 8<br />
Whilst I&#039;m not as big a fan of harem anime as I use to(only few harems I still enjoy to this day), when I did watch them I&#039;d always hope that the protagonist gets &quot;all&quot; instead of having to choose only one girl(why make one happy when you can make them all right?). Yes its unrealistic, but you don&#039;t watch a harem let alone a harem fantasy for realism, and for a franchise that practices polygamy as a norm, I believe any hot blooded male shouldn&#039;t have any room to complain.<br />
<br />
Like I earlier mentioned this review will sound very biased(especially after mentioning that I&#039;m a huge fan), so I can only say this: watch the series for yourself if your into the following genres - harem, action, likable overpowered characters and slap-stick comedy, I can guarantee that you will like Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari.

    Just a suggestion to add on to my previous review:<br />
For the weak hearted who cannot withstand suspense and a long wait-<br />
Please wait till episode 8 is released before watching episode 7. Yes,action is heating up!!<br />
<br />
Previous review-<br />
Even with almost half the ova series aired, I am still unable to rate it. <br />
So this review is not to tell you how good or bad it it, but what can be expected. <br />
In short, this is for anime fans who have yet to decide if they want to follow Isekai Seikishi Monogatari, after all, one episode a month is a long wait.<br />
<br />
When I started watching, I was actually

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18573">
        relieved that I could follow the plot quite easily. With all the references made to Tenchi Muyo, I thought I would be completely lost having missed Tenchi. <br />
While the main character Kenshi, was indeed summoned from Tenchi&#039;s world, the similarity ends there. <br />
Other than Kenshi, there is a  wide array of characters keeping it highly entertaining. Whatever character you like, you may just find one you favor here. <br />
<br />
Well, one thing that each episode never lacks is fan service. There is bound to be sensual sneak peeks or sexual connotations especially while the girls tease Kenshi mercilessly. The jokes however, are neither tacky nor slap stick, just plain &#039;high-school&#039; type of funny. <br />
<br />
But, after an action packed episode 1 that reeks of conspiracy, some viewers may be disappointed with the lack of that follows. <br />
As the adventure moves from assassination to school life, the action changes from running from enemy Mechas to running from squealing demanding girls. <br />
<br />
Still it would be unfair to judge the series as a love comedy as that is not entirely true.<br />
<br />
The beautifully executed moves and the heart gripping close calls of the fights so far are definitely worth watching. <br />
And as Kenshi gets used to his new life, the conspiracy slowly and steadily unravels. <br />
<br />
Only problem is, maybe it is going a little too slowly and I&#039;m just aching for more <br />
explosive action. I&#039;ll definitely add on to this review if more excitement unfolds. <br />
<br />
With no overpowering focus on one single genre, there is something here for different viewers. <br />
And the plot unfolds so smoothly that viewers  wouldn&#039;t be confused.    <br />
<br />
So maybe, after the last episode of this Ova is aired, I might just be satisfied after all.  <br />
 <br />

    When you were younger, maybe you heard drinking milk will make your bones stronger and make you taller. You drank so much when you were young so you could grow. Now in present day all of a sudden, you&#039;ve become lactose intolerant due to the anatomy of your body. Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is the result of this. No matter how tasty that gallon of ice cream was, or that quart of milk, your system will always suffer from intolerancy. This is essentially what Monogatari was all about, the start of a grand journey AKA the ice cream, then everything else which is the stomach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216308">
        problems, flatulence barrage and the diarrhea. But for a harem series, it wasn&#039;t the worst, I mean Kenshi was a beast, to a fault. While the first episode set a great foundation, everything after was the result of regurgitated tropes.<br />
<br />
Now let me talk about the first episode, because it was pretty great especially for a harem tagged show. It set a conflict, characterization was serious, there were mysteries that you assumed were going to be unraveled throughout the course of the show, etc. It had things that make a show good, with this series being 45 minutes an episode, it basically is a 26 episode series, thats enough time to flesh everything out and set up a grand story. This first episode is basically false hope. It does things well, like action scenes, which were pretty damn good and fluid, give the MC some tension and urgency, as well as give decent characterization to the supporting cast (AKA MC&#039;s hoes). <br />
<br />
That&#039;s where all the good stops though, because that was all just a mask to how shallow the story telling is, how one dimensional the characters are, and too much wasted time. Okay maybe the lore was OKAY at best, but it was utilized so poorly and at a point where it only became relevant because the story was unfolding right at the time of explanation. So after the first episode, most of the time spent after is building Kenshi&#039;s harem. Although there were many, with how much time was spent on it, you would&#039;ve thought that the side chicks (AKA the main cast) would get more than just a front. You thought wrong, oh boy oh boy. Now it&#039;s to be expected from a harem, ecchi tagged anime, but why turn what should&#039;ve been action galore into female galore. Pretty sure the fanservice people wanted to see was the action, I mean insert generic busty badass female into a fight and boom, you already appeal to the harem/ecchi audience while still progressing what was suppose to be action and lore dominated series. Alas, the writers seem to have gotten off at their own writing, since the same female interactions and redundant nature occur for 7 episodes, equivalent to 14 since these eps are twice as long. <br />
<br />
I mean I enjoy harems just as much as the next guy, the fundamental flaw of all of them is how good the characters are. Unfortunately, every girl is incredibly shallow, bar Lashana and maybe one other. None are developed at all, none have a really good reason for liking Kenshi, and none are any help to the conflict honestly. This is also a fault of Kenshi, he is too strong. This dude might be able to rival Tatsuya from Mahouka, both are incredibly powerful and have no flaws. The first episode gave Kenshi great internal conflict, characterization, and flaws that could be used against him. All of that is thrown out of the window, instead that potential turned into a typical harem king trope. Lack of development of the main conflict also hindered a few characters. Kenshi was just too strong for the conflict to be of any importance, I mean it didn&#039;t even matter at the end.<br />
<br />
Even more to the point of poor storytelling, there may have been as many plotholes in this as there were females that liked Kenshi. Everything the first episode established, like why Kenshi had the internal conflict (it foreshadowed something of a grand scale) was tossed over the Swan. Things didn&#039;t make sense, nothing was clear, except for the titties that were shown through the obligatory wet white t shirt scenes. Get off to that writers. There wasn&#039;t really a theme to this show either, like half of the anime consisted of running errands and you&#039;ll get ladies. Work hard gentlemen, maybe one day a female will see you and dote over you because of that. Maybe you can climb the empire state building in New York, USA when lovers start chasing you, like Kenshi.<br />
<br />
Animation was good whenever there were heated battles. Kenshi&#039;s moments were especially fluid, but fights were incredibly shallow as well. Most action scenes didn&#039;t involve Kenshi and as a result wasn&#039;t as appealing. Did I forget to mention Kenshi is overpowered and we don&#039;t know why? Yeah and the sound was good. The OST repeated itself a lot though, like there weren&#039;t that many tracks. The opening is really good, I like the aesthetics and the song was good. More titties is not a problem for me. It was also really funny that I didn&#039;t realize there was a line in the opening song that translated to &quot;it tickled to my little maternal instincts&quot; and the background is quite fitting to say the least. It was hilarious but that damn well summed up what I watched. <br />
<br />
This show is a wreck man, it was great at first but it overstayed its welcome with poor writing, shallow characters, and tropes out the a$$. If you are a fan of harem series, good news, you&#039;ll probably eat this up but lots of the fanbase for anime dislike harems. This is a must avoid if harems are not your cup of tea. I am indifferent, but everything is wrong with this that it needs to be addressed. Seriously, story direction could&#039;ve been so much better, but that would&#039;ve required a 360 turn from what was brought upon us. I think anyone that has watched this can agree that Kenshi is the king of harem kings. The lactose intolerance metaphor really nails what this show feels like.

    I&#039;m going to start by saying that &quot; I am in no way, shape or form a fan of robot Anime &quot;. Yet, I seem to have enjoyed this show considerably, which is a good thing on my part. I would hate it if I wasted my time on it. I&#039;ll use the same review criteria as I have been in the other reviews. If my grammar is off, I apologize, I haven&#039;t slept in awhile. Currently trying to tire myself out ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   The story of the show was slightly above average. Not saying it was great or original, but the show did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105737">
        have a tolerable story. What I enjoyed most was the world it took place in. You see, all the machines get their power from the world itself. They then use this to power to pilot their, what look and move like, Bio engineered mechs. Steam powered versions are still in the development stage, and only a few models exist in the beginning of the series. Only females seem to be able to pilot these mech&#039;s and the few males that can as well, are safeguarded. They are essentially held prisoner, as breeding a male and female would make a pure bred pilot who&#039;s skills are unmatched. They don&#039;t show it, but apparently they hate having to grow up and marry whichever hot anime babe their assigned to and eventually having to sex them up before they&#039;r told to move on to the next... 0_0<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   The animation style in the show was fantastic. The fights, the faces and the many awkward moments in between were made much more enjoyable by the animations. The mech fights get very intense and aren&#039;t to slow pace, which I love in fights. There were some slight annoyances in the show, such as everyone except Kenshi being inept in every way. They all stand their and get their @sses kicked, or show up after Kenshi has devised a plan to escape his various situations... Not that he needs to, seeing as how he&#039;s so OVER POWERED!!! No joke, he doesn&#039;t run into any problems until the final boss... what&#039;s the points in starting a game at level 100!?!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Sound was good, didn&#039;t much care for any voice in particular and the music never managed to get me pumped up as I prefer to be when enjoying my action. I suppose their isn&#039;t much to elaborate on when it comes to sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Now for characters. The main character is a boy named Kenshi. He&#039;s one of those few male pilots I was talking about. In my opinion, the minor thing that makes him different is that he&#039;s from another world... The greater difference being that this male happens to be the only skilled character in the show. Then there&#039;s Princess Lashara, who is a greedy useless b#tch who just so happens to give Kenshi something that&#039;s reminiscent of a life... with slavery involved. Their&#039;s plenty of other&#039;s, 95% of which are females that one by one fall for Kenshi. Then there&#039;s Dagmyer, who&#039;s a whinny b#tch that can&#039;t take getting beaten again and again and again an- I think you get it. I guess I&#039;d be pissed all the time if I was useless too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   All in all, I give the show a 6. I enjoyed the action, though it had several hilarious moments thrown in. I don&#039;t normally watch harem animes, but I stepped out of my comfort zone to try and enjoy this one. All in all, I don&#039;t think harems are for me... one crazy anime chick is good enough. Hope this review helped you out, if not then bite me... I&#039;m tired now, goodbye!

    A harem done right?<br />
<br />
[contains suggestive language, and an extreme loss of interest in constructive reasoning halfway through.]<br />
<br />
It&#039;s difficult to end a harem. Regardless of how happy the ending turns out to be, only one girl &#039;wins&#039; the guy over -- the others are presumably meant to cope with the loss. Some series like Mashiro-iro show the externalities of a singular bliss, while series like Zero no Tsukaima, like most others, avoid the topic all together. Isekai handles a harem correctly [as it is the highest rated harem on MAL], but it does so in an unorthodox manner. <br />
<br />
It does this by creating a romance so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86357">
        weak, that the very element of it could be miscategorized as simple interaction, devoid of especial sentiments. Every heroine in Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari inevitably and invariably falls in love with the protagonist -- but contrary to a typical harem series, they&#039;re all given equal screen time. There are no routes, and each heroine is subject to nothing more than the playful interactions. From the get-go, it was apparent that Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari did not intend for a meaningful romantic ending. To some viewers, that&#039;s a let-down; you typically watch a romance for a romantic ending -- a harem is synonymous with the romance genre [girls falling in love with the guy kinda fall under the category]. But, just as Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is the &quot;highest rating harem on MAL&quot;, it&#039;s also missing the elusive &quot;romance&quot; tag. <br />
<br />
Isekai is not a romance series. As to what the series excels in, it would be the character interactions. In Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, there is an underlining storyline -- the series begins integrated within the grand storyline, and it ends in a similar fashion; yet, the &quot;middle episodes&quot; of the series ignores the storyline development outside of slight mentions to development [prioritizing slice-of-life-esque interactions above hard storyline]. These episodes, which could have been erroneously miscategorized as traditional filler episodes [to a storyline-centric series], were probably the most enjoyable parts of the series. Isekai doesn&#039;t excel in dialogue; its storyline is generic [albeit not entirely predictable from the start], and its soundtrack is forgettable -- but, it combines a cast of likable characters and fresh comedy into the amalgamation that earns it score. <br />
<br />
We&#039;re given a protagonist that&#039;s essentially beta in attitude, but alpha in attributes [like really fucking alpha]. He&#039;s given a wide variety of females. From oversized breasts, to ample deposits of nature, to nonexistent ones, Isekai panders to every demographic. If you&#039;re a fan of tsunderes, there&#039;s that -- if you want an overbearing, older sister character, there&#039;s that too -- the trustworthy bodyguard? Why the fuck not. How about the silent girl who never does anything but look cute? Sorta. The genius lolicon? Sorta too. Isekai has a vast variety of characters. It&#039;s guilt-free in ending because the romance doesn&#039;t exist, they&#039;re just there to essentially look attractive [who the fuck doesn&#039;t like attractive girls?]. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s a matter of the art. Thirteen episodes and a year of airing time -- every episode has well above-average production qualities. The art style is likable and the animation is great; the colors are bright, and this section is generic as fuck. Who the fuck actually criticizes art and animation. The art&#039;s pretty and shit.<br />
<br />
[shit&#039;s being used as a noun in this case, not a negative noun, more of a passive noun --<br />
<br />
 e.g:<br />
<br />
A: What the fuck is this shit?<br />
B: It is my Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari review.<br />
A: No shit.  ]<br />
<br />
Sound: I don&#039;t even fucking remember the soundtrack. The opening song was kinda nice. There was an ending theme? Must have skipped onto the next episode before it played. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Shit was enjoyable. <br />
<br />
[I kinda dislike block reviews. I really just wanted to say that Isekai did the harem genre correctly in not creating super serious bonds between the characters. It was simple and likable. It&#039;s good because of that.]<br />
    <br />
<br />

    Oh joy, another harem series. Read that as sarcastically as possible. I still have no idea why people ask me to review these things. But this one is part of the Tenchi Muyo franchise, which I don&#039;t like, from the admittedly little of it I&#039;ve seen, but at least it&#039;s not Sekirei. Although it could very well turn out to be just as bad. I suppose I should say something along the lines of &quot;it could also surprise me and be good&quot; but I very much doubt it. Yes, it could be, but the probability is so heavily against it that it hardly bears mentioning.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review114209">
        This is Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, written by Shirane Hideki and produced by AIC spirits and BeSTACK.<br />
<br />
Our story begins with the inauguration ceremony of princess Lashara which is shortly followed up by an assassination attempt while on her way to the &quot;Holy Land.&quot; Her guards manage to prevent the attempt and capture Masaki Kenshi, a boy from another world who was involved in the attempt because he was promised a way home. His efforts get side-tracked as he becomes Lashara&#039;s servant, gets involved in random harem nonsense at her academy and becomes embroiled in a major conflict. In all fairness, there are some ideas that have potential with the conflict. The problem is the execution. The potentially interesting parts get pushed to the side in favour of the horrible harem elements and &quot;humour.&quot; As you&#039;ve probably guessed, the humour is terrible... No, it&#039;s beyond terrible. It moves beyond the realm of terrible taste and into the realm of abhorrent. Expect a lot of jokes about sexual assault. Because... Shirane Hideki is a braying jackass. There&#039;s no other explanation. Another problem with the series is that it&#039;s very predictable. You could watch the first few episodes and guess pretty much exactly what&#039;s going to happen. Then there&#039;s the issue of impact. Any given moment that would have impact in a well written series doesn&#039;t in this one. They&#039;ll give it a minute or two of screen time and then never mention it again unless the plot requires them to. There are also a lot of minor moments of stupidity and they add up. To give an example, there&#039;s a point where the characters are discussing what they should compress into a powerful weapon. When scrap metal is suggested it&#039;s dismissed as not being strong enough. After that, gold is brought up as ideal. Gold. For those of you who don&#039;t know, gold (even as an alloy or in ingots) is a very weak, malleable substance. So, in addition to being a terrible person, Shirane doesn&#039;t even science.<br />
<br />
That brings us to the cast of characters. They range from incredibly bland to extremely annoying. The one thing they do with them that&#039;s slightly different from the usual harem formula is that Kenshi isn&#039;t a hero who&#039;s just average in every respect but the girls fall all over because he&#039;s generically good. Rather, he&#039;s super-humanly good at everything except understanding people. By far the worst characters are Lashara, who is a spoiled brat, Mexiah, Ulyte and Flora (those three are all sexual predators, which is played up as being funny.)<br />
<br />
the art is pretty decent in a lot of respects. The giant robots are well designed, there are some good nature scenes as well. Unfortunately, there are a lot of issues here as well. The character faces are just awful. A lot of the time they&#039;ll randomly look super elongated or the expressions will just look really off. A bigger issue is the level of fan-service. Here&#039;s the thing, most of us know what the female body looks like and most of us can agree that there&#039;s nothing wrong with the human form. The problem is when a series like this objectifies its characters with a bunch of ass and breast shots for the sole purpose of titillating hormonal, heterosexual men. A perfect example is the flight suits. Only the female pilots wear them (which indicates that they aren&#039;t even necessary so why the hell bother changing out of your regular, comfortable clothes) and they&#039;re cut to show as much as possible. Because why bother with things like consistency and making sense when you can show boobs?<br />
<br />
The acting in this is meh. Most of the characters don&#039;t have much in terms of emotional range and the voice acting reflects that. Which is a pity since they did get some good actors like Tsunematsu Ayumi, Noda Junko and Yonezawa Madoka, to name a few. The sound is a bit grating. It&#039;s fine when they leave it in the background, but there are times when the effects get way too loud for no good reason. The opening and ending music is just annoying.<br />
<br />
The Ho-yay factor is a 4/10. And that is for yuri. Mexiah openly sleeps with her female students because Shirane apparently cares more about using lesbianism as a fetish than having a world with sensical ethical standards.<br />
<br />
This anime is awful. It has some good ideas, but they&#039;re buried under a deluge of unpleasantness, stupidity and misogyny (which could fall under unpleasantness, but I feel it merits mention as its own category.) My final rating is a 2/10. next week I&#039;ll finally be free of harem anime for a while, horror anime month begins with a look at La Portrait de Petit Cosette.<br />

    Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, the perfect harem. <br />
<br />
Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari was a fantastic show, well-animated, great music, and very likeable characters.<br />
<br />
Story - 9 <br />
The story is basically split into two arcs, the first arc is set in an elite,practically all-girls school where we meet all the main female characters and the few male protagonists. The second arc is more serious in tone and is essentially a &quot;save the world&quot; arc with Kenshi and those he has made his friends with attempting to stop a catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
Awesome! What more can i say.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10<br />
Every piece that is played from the introduction, background, and ending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72737">
        was really nice.  (the background music is played only a few times, but it sure is catchy. i found myself humming it a lot when i first finished the series lol)<br />
<br />
Characters - 11<br />
The main relationships, along with character and plot development pretty much happen around Kensh, he is the main character after all. <br />
Kenshi is probably the coolest character i have ever seen, he posses near superhuman reflexes and strength which practically make him look like a god.<br />
As the show goes on more and more women and girls gather around Kenshi, and in the end fall madly in love with him. A repeating event in the show is Kenshi being chased by all these girls, but when you consider that this is an OVA of the Tenchi universe you can&#039;t really be surprised by that lol. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10<br />
Harem,Mecha, OVA of Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki, what more can you ask for<br />

    To be honest i can&#039;t remember the real reason why i downloaded Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari since i really hate the &quot;Mecha&quot; genre of anime. What i do remember is the reason i watched this anime is because of the awesomeness of the OP song, i cant quite put my finger on it but let&#039;s settle for the reason: I really felt the soothing tune that made me feel safe.<br />
<br />
There i go, watched the first episode. At the ending it made me really curious on about what&#039;s going to happen next, which is a sign that i enjoy watching the anime. One more thing is,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87107">
        i failed to notice that the first episode had a 51 minute runtime, WHICH MADE ME REALIZE THAT I WAS REALLY ENJOYING THIS ANIME.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot: 10/10.<br />
<br />
The plot has so many twists and turns, which i admire very much because there isn&#039;t much anime that can make your predictions wrong. With that said, most of my predictions on this anime were denied/mistaken/wrong, and that made me watch it more and more. There are some things that were left unexplained/unclear like how did he get into their world etc. But upon searching for answers i think you must watch the Tenchi Muyo series. Ecchi scenes were decent. I also admired the idea that the Male sekishi&#039;s(Male Pilots) are like Gold. Male seikishi&#039;s are very rare, which leads into an ultimate harem paradise. To wrap it all up, i gave the 10/10 score because for me, it was really worth it, the plot was unique for me, and i highly recommend this to be watched by everyone.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
Like i said, i really hate the &quot;Mecha&quot; anime genre. But i find the mecha here fine,mainly because it was not all machine(Comapared to gundam and others.). Animation was smooth for my standards, and having each character a unique kind of seikishin is just awesome.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
The sounds when royalty arrive, when there are battles, all the background music here is just in sync. Sound effects were very good. The voices of the characters were great. And did i mention the OP song was so awesome?<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
<br />
The characters here are &quot;Unique&quot;. One reason is because they have their own form of seikishin&#039;s. Another is they are from different kingdoms/race etc. An OP Protagonist from a different world. A newly crowned young queen that loves to make money, a tsundere, a ton of mysterious characters and more. But of course, the mysterious characters here really defines the word &quot;Mysterious&quot;. And may i just add, the harem girls here are all beautiful in their own ways. This is one of the best anime harem anime out there people, I&#039;ll bet my life on that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
Fully watching a 45 minutes per episode anime ain&#039;t enough to prove that you are enjoying the anime? Okay *Insert Okay meme here*. From the first episode to the last, enjoyment is really evident. Mainly because you will have the urge to want more. For me one of the reasons that i enjoyed this anime are the twists and surprises it brings. I wont state these twists and surprises though, it&#039;s up to you to know :D.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is, by all means, one of the best anime that i have ever watched. In every scenes that a mysterious character is shown, it will leave you wondering, &quot;What would that guy do and why do he knows a lot of things?&quot; kind of thinking. Later on, you will know, and you will be surprised by everything when revelations are revealed(REDUNDANCY&#039;S FTW!). Another thing is this is the first 45 minute per episode anime that i finished and the first mecha anime that i loved. This anime just keeps on making you want more every ending of one episode. When i finished watching this, it just left me there hungry for more. Overall, This anime is just Great/Outstanding/Amazing/Magnificent. Highly recommended to be watched by everyone.

    So after watching this anime two times now, ive decided to write a review. This will be my first so please dnt throw me to the wolves yet. So i shall begin.<br />
<br />
Story- 9/10<br />
Another anime where a boy is thrown into an unknown world where he becomes of great use. Machines called Seikishi dominate the military aspect of a country and can only be controlled by certain people. And of course, Misaki Kenshi happens to be one of these people. Good progression throughout the series and most things are explained thoroughly. The ending makes a second season desirable. For not being an original plot, this series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29270">
        keeps you interested with its humor and half-bit romance.<br />
<br />
Art- 8/10<br />
Sorry but I have no taste in art so this is really just the number that popped up when i thought about it.<br />
<br />
Sound- 10/10<br />
Personally i loved the opening and ending songs. Just listening to the opening gets you pumped for the actual show.<br />
<br />
Character- 8/10<br />
Characters development is minimal in my opinion except when love interest start to appear, but i gave it an 8 because i think that made it more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10/10<br />
This show made my life when i watched it the first time. I could not stop watching it. Action combined with humor and romance peaked my interest too much.<br />
<br />
Overall- 10/10<br />
I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys the three things i mentioned above. Must have second season!

    If you like Harem anime and are a fan of Tenchi Muyo and don&#039;t like the plots to be heavy.  Then this is probably the anime for you.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s action, a bit of romance, tons of slapstick and all the archetypal characters that are usually found in light hearted anime.<br />
<br />
As a person who avoids drinking tap water, I must tell you that this show was dreadful.  The story was weak, the plot was bizarre and confusing and the characters were mostly annoying.<br />
<br />
When someone tries to kill you, i imagine that if you had some kind of power or mecha, you probably would want to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153283">
        make sure they didn&#039;t come back and try again.  In this show, of 13 episodes that are about 45 minutes a piece.  The antagonists would plot, get the upperhand, then attack.  The hero would beat them down, and then he would just start talking to somebody and the antagonists would run away, so they could plot more and attack again.<br />
<br />
So it was a little frustrating to have to keep rehashing the same baddies about 10 times a peice throughout the show.  Which might float your boat, but was just made me question why they didn&#039;t at least tie them up or something.  The antagonists were by and large pretty malicious and evil and intelligent.<br />
<br />
So the moral of the story is that really naive, stupid people are heroes.  Now i only gave one example of this, you will find out that i didn&#039;t spoil anything because this type of thing happens throughout the show to such an astounding degree that i was getting a little tired of rolling my eyes.  And i have a good ability to suspend my disbelief.  with all the boobels flopping around, i couldn&#039;t reconcile this being for kids, but it was one of the most shounen shows i&#039;ve ever watched.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, iit&#039;s like something you would expect from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but with tits flopping around and the mega harem.  Even if you shut your brain off, it will pull you right back into reality with the absurdity they display.  <br />
<br />
The art and sound were actually great, so visually and audibly it did everything right.  The cookie cutter characters and the indecipherable plot points made it a trainwreck imo.<br />
<br />
The first episode is actually pretty off putting, but episode 2-5 are actually pretty good.  It&#039;s the redundancies with the overarching story and poor explanations that make the latter half of the show borderline unwatchable.   And spoiler alert<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***************<br />
You don&#039;t get any sort of payoff for sitting through it.  Cheesy anime endings will sometimes tingle my spine, but this just fizzled out so anticlimactically that it just made me shake my head.  They could have ditched the stupid long winded build up and summed up the &quot;ending&quot; in 1 episode and given us the afterstory for the rest.

    Firstly, watch the show.<br />
<br />
Second, I don&#039;t write reviews. I looked at the review screen once, thought better, then went to watch anime like the rest of us. I&#039;ve seen hundreds of shows without exaggerating. I can confidently say that this show is one of the greatest and most under appreciated shows I&#039;ve ever had the privilege to watch. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
The story is typical. Boy meets girl. Girl tests boy. Boy is a god among men. Girl makes boy her pawn. Boy gets harem. Madness. Oh yeah and the girl is a princess or something and he has to fight in some war or another with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190314">
        a mech suit that he pilots better than people who&#039;ve trained for decades, but that&#039;s irrelevant. It&#039;s typical, but the anime finds ways to give it fresh spins and keep the show ALIVE and ENTERTAINING.<br />
<br />
Art:7 Sound:6<br />
<br />
I&#039;m pairing these together as they both lacked anything special. They weren&#039;t bad and the movement of characters as well as the voices and sounds seemed effective. More so when you consider this is an OVA on a low budget. Still, the show made due with what it had. I was satisfied.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
OPPAI! Tits, knockers, double DD&#039;s, fun-bags, hooters, chest, boobies. Call them what you want but they dominate the characters. It&#039;s not as bad as anything with the words high school in the name but its nothing to scoff at. There aren&#039;t plot irrelevant boobs, but unlike most show, the smaller your boobs, the more time you get having your story explained. I would have LOVED more in depth information on the characters, especially the MC, but I take what I was fed and I find that I enjoyed each one of the girls in his harem for who they were as well as their over-sized tools of mass seduction. Primarily though, the characters sucked. The greatest pull for me was how they interacted so fluidly despite a lack of backstory, and each of them does fall (broadly) under an archetype that we all know and love (yes you do).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
This show&#039;s biggest drawn is the comical aspect. I couldn&#039;t stop laughing no matter how many times I watched it. It was funny through and through watching him literally chased with nets (you&#039;ll see). It&#039;s ludicrous and funny and simply perfect<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
Watch 2 episodes. For you Otaku out there, I know you have the time. If you don&#039;t like it then drop it, but I promise satisfaction from at least that much. Even if you leave, you&#039;ll be back.

    Before start watch this anime, I liked two things they are a genres and R+ Mild Nudity.<br />
<br />
Watching the first episode, I was thinking that the anime will be just in my tase<br />
but.... after second and third episodes however, I was going to drop this show, but later however, I was carried away not only by the main story but also by the main character and his story=I fell in love with.<br />
If we talk about art then I put 7/10 they are all beautiful except the animation slightly lame (sometimes she&#039;s a bad) except liked very mutch how moving mechas and how beautiful they were is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283953">
        drawn. Sound and music also satisfied but could be much better 7/10. Character- MC-Kenshi- It would be a perfect hero if he were a romantic but..... QQ so many girls fell in love with him and if I were in his place then all girls had already been ****** a the main character looks like a castrated should be but in overall not bad.<br />
Enyoyment 10/10- Every episode every day.<br />
Overall- 8/10 I liked everything in general except for one detail- R+ mild nudity??? nope.... more looks like 16+ but tbh I recommend this anime for that who really like mecha fights with epic or unexpected moments.

    You know that feeling when you&#039;re just randomly looking for anime to watch and suddenly find something you end up marathoning back-to-back for that entire day. Yeah, that happened with this anime.<br />
<br />
The short version:<br />
(+)The MC can handle himself.<br />
(+)The characters are fun to watch.<br />
(+)When it gets going it&#039;s worth the wait.<br />
(+)A nice mix of Fantasy and Mecha<br />
(-)The show REALLY takes it time to get going.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE GOOD:<br />
Firstly the story, it isn&#039;t the sort were they spend the first few episodes to explain how everything works, it more or less drops you in the middle of the world and leaves it to you to figure out how it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189439">
        works, which is a nice change of pace from the first episode getting you ready for the show to get straight into it, then spends the next 3 episodes explaining how the entire world works, don&#039;t get me wrong some shows do the whole exposition dump well to the get the rules down so you don&#039;t ask questions later, but in Isekai no Seikishi that isn&#039;t necessary because the show has confidence in your ability to piece stuff together. The story grinds to a fucking halt at a point but when it picks back up, it&#039;s worth the wait, and when the need just a little bit of a plot twist to shake up the show, they pull it off well enough that you probably won&#039;t see it coming, unless you&#039;re an elf with Farsight or something.<br />
<br />
Onward to the characters, there&#039;s more than a few, and I can tell you who&#039;s who just by naming the one quirk they have but I&#039;ll give you a bit more in the review. To cast a blanket description over all the characters, they all know how to do what they do in the most efficient way. The pilots know how to pilot really well, the princesses know how to play the nobility game well, everyone knows what their job is and how to do it. The MC I really like, a young man named Kenshi Masaki, the one-in-a-million protagonist of a harem show that can handle himself without any difficulty, seriously the lad can handle everything from household chores to an entire school of girls chasing after him everyday of the week, even taking on entire swarm of enemies like they ain&#039;t shit, if you have watched your fair share of harem, this guy with be a vein of fresh air in terms of a male lead.<br />
<br />
To the art and sound, the art, shit you not, made me think this anime was made last year or something, but no it was made in 2010, there were moments that I thought, &quot;Woah visuals, hold it together.&quot; But then again this only happened twice in the entire run of the show. The sound is nothing to really talk about, the voice acting was done well enough that I though the characters were actually reacting to the situation at hand, rather than someone just reading from a piece of paper. The OST is fine, no one track grabbed me and said, &quot;You will buy the OST for the sole purpose of listening to me!&quot; and the OP and ED didn&#039;t really annoy me at all so yeah nothing much to talk about in terms of sound.<br />
<br />
THE BAD:<br />
They spend WAY too much time at that fucking academy, it seems like the entire purpose of that place is for the MC to increase his harem count. With each episode being about 45 mins long, spending a bit more than half of your run-time just doing basically fuck all in one place, I can see some people dropping this show after only 4 or 5 episodes, but trust me when I say you should tough it out, because the home stretch is much better than that period of monotony.<br />
<br />
THE VERDICT:<br />
I would recommend Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari to anyone whose looking for a good mecha series, that manages to mix in a bit of fantasy in at the same time, or just anyone who wants to kill a day watching a fun anime. Some people will drop this show because it drags right in the middle of the series, but for those that stick it out, you will be happy when you finish this show.<br />
<br />
Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.

    I had no idea that I had stumbled upon one of the greatest animes I have ever seen.  The 45 minute episodes were just great as hell.  I had to wait for a month for each episode to come.  By the end of the month I would mad dash to my room and watch the episode from intro to the end of the credits. My mom thought I was on crack or something and I told her it was just an anime.  I did not know this was a spinoff of Tenchi-Muyo, another great series I like, and did not know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60709">
        until a later episode when Washu&#039;s silhouette was in the background.  Completely hilarious and the plot was very great but not that original.  Every episode that was about the school made me laugh so hard I swear I would&#039;ve died.  I am a fan of girls chasing a boy for some reason or other so I REALLY enjoyed the episodes where he was chased.<br />
<br />
All in all its a adventure anime with the boy being &quot;summoned&quot; to another world or later in the anime it hints to a spaceship, so I&#039;m guessing its another planet.  The protagonist is trying to get home any way he can.  It starts with him trying to assassinate the princess, but he fails and is almost killed.  He is later captured by the princess and made her servant.  Kenshi is later found out to be very strong and agile and everyone wants him working in their departments such as cooking, tailoring, washing, housekeeping, and many other tedious tasks.  The ending was predictable yet enjoyable. I rate this at 9.7/10 of I could.

    This is one that I always end up going back to as of how funny it is and how relaxed it is to watch. So starting with the story it not as good as some others i watch as it could have a bit more explaining and detail to it for me, but that is comparing story and detail with something like overlord.

        not one i diss like which is normal something I find in all anime, but they are always a joy for me to watch and laugh at there reactions to what is going on.<br />
The fighting in this is also very fun to watch with mechs and with out.<br />
<br />
Overall all I do put this at a 10 as most of the time this amount of enjoyment is hard to find in a lot of anime and would say if you liked trigun you would probly like this as well.<br />

    I really enjoyed this series and hope they come up with another season. I&#039;m a huge fan of the Tenchi Muyo series so finding out that this takes place in the whole series made me like it more. From just finishing Photon The Idiot Adventures and now seeing this. It makes me want to watch more of the series by the this creator. But back to Saints knight Tale<br />

The story was great I liked how it gave you more information about the characters as the episodes went on. The art of fantastic there were some scenes that looked like they could be better but the

        tenchi muyo series draw it that way I think for comic relief, just to point in hated the drawer for Tenchi in Tokyo. The music was really good loved the beginning watched the opening on every episode. The characters were great that&#039;s why I hope they come up with another season. Enjoyed this series very much. Overall I give it a 10

    A boy gets sent to a new world(he&#039;s related to Tenchi) he has the skills of a master fighter/swordsmen/robotpilot. His role that you find out in the end was to deal with a thing called Gaia(ADemonShield or entity).But at the start he doesnt know why is there or who sent him. He spends his days helping others out and running from girls while trying to fight the people who want to start a war. If you like Harem, Robot fights, and a good guy who is badass this anime is for you.
