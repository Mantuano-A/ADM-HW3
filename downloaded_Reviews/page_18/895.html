      This is the second season of Saekano and like it should it starts of after the ending of the first one.<br />
  I liked the first season but to me it didn&#039;t seem to be anything special or worth remembering, i mean you had the best girl fight like you have in any harem show nowadays, but this second season just raised the bar so high that it kept me waiting and hoping that thursday would finally come so i could watch this show.<br />
  Story - 9<br />
-This story is very straightforward, you have the MC, Tomoya and his circle trying to make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250665">
        this game happen. Althought they sure as hell struggle a lot in the meanwhile, making the actual completition of the game a lot more rewarding in general.<br />
  Art - 10<br />
-The art in saekano was just plain fenomenal, from the ecchi parts to the emocional parts, it was totally outstanding for the harem type of show.<br />
  Sound - 8<br />
-The sound was good throught the series, i&#039;ve seen better and i&#039;ve seen worse. Nothing to complain here althought near the end there were some really good songs in the emocional moments.<br />
  Caracters - 9<br />
-The main caracter oh well it&#039;s your harem protagonist, has all the girls but since he is an otaku doesn&#039;t really want any of them. That can sometimes get a bit anoying, but  he is the key caracter in the story after all. The girls on the other hand, might have &quot;cliched&quot; personalities like the childhood friend tsundere and so on but the anime actually jokes with that a lot and that makes it really entertaning. All of the girls have interesting aspects about them and make the story was more interesting overall. And yes this is the type of show where everyone fights about the best girl.<br />
  Enjoyment and overall - 9<br />
-This show for sure raised the bar and for sure is a must watch for those who enjoyed the first season, but speaking personally, mostly near the end, this series became something that i felt growing, the caracters, their struggles and everything arround them changed in this 23 episodes. I loved the ending and overall loved the series as a whole. This is not your average harem show with no plot at all, Saekano has a story and is really nicely executed.<br />
Thanks for reading this far, and if you just skipped to see the end, tldr it was an awesome show and you should give it a try for sure.

    Man, I can&#039;t believe I suffered through 4 episodes just to write a review but apparently you have to...thanks MAL<br />
<br />
Well, well, well wasn&#039;t this an unfortunate mistake. If there&#039;s one thing I hate, is anime series that are pretentious and lure you in with false promises of an enriching story (granted this was pretty much NOT that). The story continues off the 1st season where...oh who cares, the plot is in the description...I&#039;m just here to tell you it&#039;s awful. Some find this show enjoyable but I&#039;m not here to argue taste, you have yours and I have mine.<br />
<br />
This show is as shallow as it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247610">
        gets from the plot to the characters to the melodrama. Shows like this try to give the impression that they try to build on the story and develop the characters but all they do is try to give random ecchi moments and who is going to sit on the MC&#039;s rod first...sounds like a masterpiece at work here. Why do these series keep pandering to the beta-male, where it&#039;s one bland, awful, dense mary-sue with the personally of chalk character get to have 5 beautiful girls fight for his attention? If the point is to make relatable characters, what&#039;s with all the heavily unrealistic situations? When will someone like the MC ever succeed in real life by being the way he is? I guess you have to pander to those with these traits and if being pathetic sells, I guess you have to cater towards your target market but I digress...<br />
<br />
The female characters don&#039;t do much to the series...it&#039;s like the only time they feature is when they bicker amongst each other for the MCs approval. Their personalities fall into the common trope of: <br />
<br />
Eriri - flat-chested tsundere with blonde pigtails and MC&#039;s childhood friend...I could reach into a bucket and pull out 10 of these<br />
 <br />
Utaha - miss perfect, blessed with intelligence and beauty trying to give off an imposing figure of a lion with her cold attitude but is reduced to a kitten when the MC drops a compliment<br />
<br />
Michiru - basically there for incest fanservice, always very physical with the MC much to the despair of the others, often very flirty as well<br />
<br />
Megumi - the plain, soft spoken type, always tries to help others rather emotionless girl that opens up slowly with the help of her friends, some might say the perfect girlfriend <br />
<br />
And last but not least...the MC: Tomoya Aki...there has to be a reason why girls are attracted to him...is it his pasty skin? His bland appearance? His barely existent personality? His density or the fact that he&#039;s a hardcore geek that spends his money on games and anime? All these things make up the boy girls want...that&#039;s what they tell us so it must be true, right? <br />
<br />
Everything that takes place, each thing these girls achieve is just to please the MC in the end and try to earn his affection. They serve no other purpose other than being the MC&#039;s romantic interest, ending up in questionable situations and random ecchi moments to appease the fans and sell BDs. A true shame since many good characters in series like this just end up as sex objects and shipping fuel. <br />
<br />
This show is a special kind of bad. I&#039;ve known this since the first season but I stuck around like fly on shit seeing if it gets better but in the end you realize, like the fly, you&#039;re literally wasting time and being entertained by a turd.<br />

    After stumbling across this series and binge-watching the entirety of Season 1, with regard to this season, I think I was able to get more enjoyment overall from the show. I felt like this season there was more focus on the character dynamics between Tomoya, Megumi, Utaha and Eriri. As a result I felt like they were able to get much more character development than I felt they did in Season 1.<br />
I feel like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is one of the better anime in the Harem genre and it doesn&#039;t really have many of the failings one might find when watching anime with Harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250667">
        within it. The only perceived negative I can give the show is maybe the way it handles the fan service and even then it doesn&#039;t bother me personally.<br />
If you watched season 1 of this anime and you are considering giving season 2 a go, I can recommend you do it. You will enjoy just as much, if not more than Season 1!<br />
<br />
I hope we can get a Third Season!

    The road for a ‘Creative’ is a long and difficult one.  The pressure of meeting deadlines, constantly improving yourself, and ultimately making something that you want is a struggle that many artists find themselves in as they try and share with the world the vision that they have.  And so we find ourselves with the second season of Saekano, as we see the conclusion of what the doujin circle ‘Blessing Software’ has to offer.<br />
<br />
Story:  Picking off from the first season, Saekano Flat (which I will refer to as ‘Flat’ for the rest of the review) continues the story of Tomoya Aki and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250678">
        the rest of Blessing Software as they complete the destined galge that the group’s members have been tirelessly working on.  <br />
<br />
Similar to its first season, Flat refines and solidifies the cast’s struggles and relationships with each other alongside the characters’ progress with the development of the game.  In particular, the show focuses heavily on two of the main female leads, Utaha and Eriri, as they come to terms with their lives as creators and what it is they want, as many of the show’s conflicts and problems are centered around these two and the kind of goals they have for themselves and with Tomoya.  As such, the story feels a lot more personal for these girls, and the screentime is used as such to dedicate moments and developments that center around them, thus giving the audience a better understanding of their characterization.  <br />
<br />
An issue with the story however is how much of an imbalance there is with the characterization.  Personally, I feel like Eriri’s portion of the story is far stronger while Utaha’s feels muted in comparison.  Utaha’s struggles just don’t seem as impactful when compared to how the series builds up Eriri and the kinds of things she deals with later on in the series.  I chalk that up more on the series using Eriri as the series’ climax, but it still does feel unfair when looking at the two at face value.  <br />
<br />
Another is how the rest of the main cast, Tomoya and Kato, have their problems mostly have their problems shoved to the side.  Tomoya kind of averts this problem by being a core aspect that influences the rest of the cast, and as such, gains growth and the ability to grow from that, but Kato mostly gets shoved to the side and only really gets to shine in 1-2 episodes as the main focus.  The way they present her is nice, but I honestly wished that they did more with her than just do what they did with her.<br />
<br />
With all of these factors in play, the show ultimately culminates into an ending that I would largely describe as ‘fitting’ given the kinds of factors put in play.  It’s not the most dramatic ending, especially compared to some of the more high-tension scenes from previous episodes.  But it is what I feel like is a very fitting ending for the series and ends on a high note all things considering, as the show still retains its comedic charm despite all of the drama that had happened before.<br />
<br />
Overall, Flat was a solid second season that had many good and bittersweet aspects to it that culminated into a well-rounded show.  Indeed the imbalance of dedication and time spent on the characters made some seem more important than others, but its usage of the artist struggle and personal desire to excel contrasting the struggle of personal vs. professional life made up for a good portion of the mistakes that the show ended up making on its journey to the end.  (You know, despite it only having eleven episodes.  Eleven episodes for a cour is weird.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Finished story (because many anime don’t actually do this.)<br />
+ Drastic characterization (with consequences and bittersweet moments)<br />
-  Imbalance with how drastic characterization is between characters<br />
<br />
Characters: The cast itself doesn’t change much between seasons, so instead of a general rundown, I’m going to be talking more about the specifics on some of the cast shifts.  <br />
<br />
Most prominently for the series are Utaha and Eriri.  As mentioned before, these two are Flat’s centerpiece when compared to the one arc they each got in season one.  Compared to season one focusing more on them licking at old wounds, Flat shows the girls and their attempts at looking towards the future as the show asks the question: What happens once the game’s finished?  I praised the show before for given a realistic spin on the idealistic ‘harem’ scenario, as each of the girls have their own separate lives and personalities apart from their involvement with the game and Tomoya, and Flat gives further evidence for that fact as the story progresses.  You see these girls blossom by themselves as individual character, and it’s a really nice change of pace that in my opinion separates this show from other harem/drama shows, and as such, gives itself a positive identity.  <br />
<br />
Then there’s Tomoya.  If I really had to pin down what Tomoya does, it would be riding off of the ‘character development train’ that both Eriri and Utaha forge ahead on.  Most of Tomoya’s characterization and struggle comes off from those two girls as he sees the result of his actions and comes to terms with what has to be done with all of them.  While yes he has a few unsightly moments, it results in a lot of genuine growth that is again, something that’s a nice change of pace.  It sucks that it comes from a source that’s not him, but it doesn’t really hurt the series that much when you put it in context.<br />
<br />
 Kato however doesn’t do all that much.  As mentioned before, she only has like…one, may one and a half episodes dedicated to her.  She mostly plays a background role to all of this rather than the ‘main heroine’ as the series (namely Tomoya) made her out to be.  The one episode she does get in the middle fixes several of the problems that we encounter, but doesn’t really justify her lack of involvement if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Comparatively, the rest of the cast is hardly there.  Because the show is so heavily focused on our main 4 characters, everyone else is basically shoved to the side and if anything, act as a slight instigator to some sections of the plot.  It’s a shame too, because characters like the Hashima siblings and Michiru had potential; they just weren’t used much at all.  (They do point this out in the show, however it doesn’t rectify the problem.)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Heavy main characterization<br />
-  Kato does very little (And that’s a bad thing if you ask me.)<br />
-  The supporting cast basically does nothing.<br />
<br />
Art:  Produced by A-1, the art for Saekano is the same light and gentle artstyle that it had back in season one.  The red highlights on the eyebrows for the girls still bother me, but there really isn’t much different or bad in the way of the art department.  <br />
<br />
There are also quite a number of camera shots that’re intentionally framed for fanservice (mostly involving Utaha actually) however.  I’d argue that it’s tasteful fanservice, since the circumstances that they come about could actually happen in real life to some degree.  They’re not really that common, and if noticed, don’t really impact the story or anything of that sort to any major degree.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Pretty much the same art as Season 1<br />
+/- Fanservice shots (Some people still don’t like fanservice no matter what it is.)<br />
<br />
Sound: The new OP and ED for Flat, “Stella Breeze” and “Sakura-iro Diary” both share a similar style as being bright and gentle pieces with a slight bit of energy and a hint of somberness to them.  Both of them are actually quite nice, and personally, I think that they’re a good reflection for the series that they’re a part of.  <br />
<br />
My only complaint is how similar the two of them sound.  They both share such a similar tone in sound that I’d argue that you could switch the two around and you could achieve a similar effect in the series.  Overall though, really nice tracks, though I’d also argue that they’re not quite that memorable?  Yeah, I’ll go with that.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Good tracks that reflect the series<br />
-	Sound very samey<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: With the plethora of harem/romance shows that I have haphazardly slapped onto my list, it becomes an increasingly difficult trial for me to find many harem shows that I would not only actually enjoy, but also find interesting due to how samey many of them feel while watching.  Saekano not only gives me that interesting harem story that I was looking for, but also speaks to me as a creator and gives me a way to relate to these characters.  So for that reason, Saekano is one of my all-time favorites in the category.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
I did.  I really did.  Despite it having a very, very bittersweet climax and resolution, I really enjoyed the characters and the story.  Not only that, but I like how Saekano itself acts as a bit of a parody of the harem genre because all of the characters know and avoid the general conventions of the genre while also proving itself to be more than just a show with several girls chasing after him.  The character interactions are also really, really fun to watch.  <br />
<br />
What didn’t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Personally, I just don’t like the climax.  Not for how it was presented or how it was written, but for how it hits me personally.  It’s very hard to make decisions like that, and as a fan of the series; it’s an understandably bittersweet moment to witness because if I may be honest, I like the entire main cast; maybe Kato more than anyone, but I still like everyone.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you watched Season one, watch Flat.  I promise you won’t regret it.  (Or maybe you will because you, like me, have personal attachment to these characters.  I don’t know.)  If you haven’t, I would suggest this show highly.  It’s has a lot of merit to it, and tells a complete story about the problems with personal life vs. professional life combined with the struggles with being a creator, a topic that not that many anime actually cover despite itself being an art medium.<br />

    This review exists purely for the purpose of aiding those who watched episode 9 and are wondering why you feel the need to throw up at the nearest toilet seat. So if you arrived here after watching the particular episode, or is the unfortunate soul that decided to start watching this show, you have come to the right place. Now you may be wondering what exactly happened in episode 9 to force me to create a myanimelist account and write a review for the first time in my life, but I will get to that in a moment. Before we get to my most hated

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249561">
        moment in anime history, I will expand upon the rest of the show first.<br />
<br />
Episode 1~ 8<br />
<br />
Story : 6 Art : 8 Sound : 6 Character : 7 Enjoyment: 8 Overall : 7<br />
<br />
Now the story is nothing to write home about. It involves our good old protagonist Aki Tomoya who decides to actually finish his ambitious game with talents that go way over his head. He messes up a lot as usual and fixes the broken parts with the classic harem protagonist appeal. <br />
<br />
So in order to justify my enjoyment, the art and characters have to carry the rest. Art is standard most of the time, but there are unique flare moments mixed in, which enhances the show immensely. The fact that it isn&#039;t completely covered with this style is far better in the theme of this show of ordinary (= boring) developments that lead to moments of beauty (= heroine).<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are not out of the ball park either, but they make sense and are funny at times, which I believe to be the most important feature of any show driven by the characters and their interaction. Any action a character takes must make sense in the context of the character, which is established beforehand by the various interactions that the character makes with other characters. For instance, if character A has consistently avoided character B, we establish that A probably dislikes B. Now, any action A takes that involves interacting with B must have a solid reason. It could be a misunderstanding (A only avoided B because B had a cat with him always and A is deathly afraid of cats), a specific B-achievable goal (A needs B&#039;s help to do something), or even a deux ex machina (A gets hit by a car and loses all memory. Note that this kind of plot device is often referred to as garbage, complete bullshit, etc. But it&#039;s still better than nothing, because the writer is acknowledging that it wouldn&#039;t make any sense for A and B to interact for no reason).<br />
<br />
I have no comment to make about the sound design other than that it complements the show, but does nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
So, ultimately, the rating resolves to overall 7, the closest it gets to my enjoyment rating while still considering other elements of the show.<br />
<br />
Now, you may be wondering, what went wrong for my previous rating of 7 to turn into 2 over the course of one episode. That&#039;s where you would be wrong. This swift downturn happened in the course of approximately 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Episode 9<br />
<br />
Story : 1 Art : 8 Sound : 6 Character : 2 Enjoyment : 2 Overall : 2<br />
<br />
Now, for those of you who are worried about possible spoilers, don&#039;t worry about it, I won&#039;t spoil anything so you can finally understand the feeling of your stomach turning inside out.<br />
<br />
To summarize it briefly, imagine having your entire show built around a single thing, and then smash it on the ground and make the viewers watch the remains of what was the basis of the show just get flushed down the drain by the rain. The execution of this episode was exactly like that. You could have the exact same scenario happen without the characters adding the unnecessary drama. The entire &quot;turn&quot; happened only to create drama, which is the antithesis of the whole show.<br />
<br />
So yes, that is why you are disgusted with this show all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Should you watch this show? No. Should you feel bad about watching ep. 9? Yes.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and just drop this show right now like me.

    first, i will talk about the art. the art is amazing. how the animator draws the eye, the curve of the body, and the animation is remarkable. The characters&#039;s eye reminds me about Grisaia&#039;s art. Though the studio is different. Nice art, A-1 Pictures.<br />
<br />
about music is still far compared to season 1, which gives the Icy Tail a chance for them to perform. But in season 2 they do not appear even once.<br />
<br />
About the character, the main character is too weak and can make the audience feel the anger is quite extraordinary. especially when he refused to come to pick up eriri when she was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272391">
        sick. but it turns out he came and decided to come. even if it sacrifices the games they have striven for.<br />
about other characters they are quite good and can offset the &#039;standard&#039; character of an anime. there are some characters such as silent / moody (kasumi), tsundere stubborn (eriri), plain and kind (megumi), and jolly also aggressive (michiru).<br />
<br />
About the story, it&#039;s pretty good. about how Japanese creators are faced with a difficult choice, reaching any way to get to the top, overcoming how to deal with setbacks, and how to make decisions to develop.<br />
<br />
Then about how the main character creates a heroine of dreams, from the way they speak, behave, answer questions, respond to others, that&#039;s pretty impressive. to pick out clothes on heroine to become a real heroine.<br />
But still, season 1 is more fun. I feel this 2nd season is too explain a lot of less important things even can run from the main storyline. let alone the flow that makes the kasumi and eriri out of the group. although it was good enough for them, but I was a bit disappointed. but I can not reason much about it. because such a thing is needed for their creators to flourish.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that when both of them missed the train and the kasumi said that if he belonged to the main character and his life was in the grip of the main character, I was a little happy because it might just make them fail to join Akane and stay with the blessing software. but that would not be possible. is indeed a dilemma.<br />
<br />
thanks for reading my first review of MAL. enjoy!

    To keep it simple, I like this show. It&#039;s not one of those typical harem show that would&#039;ve suffice the needs of all horny men as a fap material, and of those that like to be teased by an animated sexy and cute 2D girl where real sex never really happen in this show, despite how turned on the MC should&#039;ve been in those situation. In this case, Saenai Heroine no sodatekata is one of those rare show where the MC lacks the libido, or aka, sexual lust for 3D women; even if they&#039;re a cute blonde loli tsundere whose reputation and status as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247721">
        cute or one of the beautiful girls in school are apparent and is accredited in a beauty contest (she&#039;s also half western and is rich as fuck) . Or, his own fucking sexy cousin, who would wear little clothing at home, even in the same room as the MC with no shame and tact. Or, a girl who&#039;s acclaimed to be one of the popular writer and perfect in aspects any male would want: beautiful, intelligent, graceful, cold, and composed. Or a girl with a dull personality, demeanor and manner of speech, but is apparently a main heroine to his ideal 2D girl&#039;s character.<br />
<br />
The situation as a whole seem far fetched from reality, and it really is, considering that all of these successful (well two of them) girls flock over the MC like he&#039;s the only man there is for them to be with. In a situation like this we would be expecting a story or themes, just like in any harem anime, revolving around romance, jealousy, forbidden love, guilt and so on. But this anime doesn&#039;t only explores only that, it explored a sort of rivalry experience as the story do go on a route of creating a game, with the dull girl, Kato, as an ideal heroine, and to become one of the best game out there. The story is somewhat similar to bakuman and shirobako. Both anime explored the inner working of a team working on an anime, in this case, this anime explores the inner working and the experience of a team working on a visual novel, with an acclaimed light novel author as the lead of the script writing team (as she&#039;s the only one lol), and one of the ingenious blonde loli with great adroitness to drawing ability (and again, the only one working on it). The team is basically his harem, where their specialty are delegated to the right place on the team for creating a game. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the dialogue may not be as great or rivaled the monogatari series. The dialogue is actually written in a very humorous and witty manner with its metaphors, subtle complains or insults, breaking the 4th wall and such. So this does make the entirety of the show not as boring as it seem. Although, in some part of the show I gotta admit, I almost fall asleep or have the inclination to skim over it.<br />
<br />
Another quality of this anime that makes this show so great or fun to watch is basically, the character are cute, unique and likable. But ofc, this naturally boils down to your personal interests for a character, for a certain set of personality and appearances, though, some character may seem to be the cliche type, while some, like Katou, would be one of the unique ones in the show. <br />
<br />
As such, give this anime a go even if you&#039;re not a harem fan. As i&#039;m not a huge harem fan myself, it just seem like it&#039;s fine for me for an anime to be a harem show, when the MC is an otaku that have no sexual desire for an actual female in the real world, or is actually a pervert much like any other harem MC there is. And just to be warned, the fanservice is kinda heavy on this one, though they are very self aware on this one lmao. If you watch the episode 0 of season 1 or 2, you will see the 4th wall crumbling down as the character voiced their honest complain or statement about this anime. Oh and much like Oreimu, the anime also explored shit like people hating on Otaku culture and other such serious subjects that may come up in the story.

    While the first season was about how to be a team, this second season is ironically about how to be an individual.<br />
<br />
Before the second season begins, the ragtag doujin circle named Blessing Software has had old-school fun as they take on one and only agenda: creating the finest doujin dating sim at Winter Comiket. However, as soon as the second season rolls, things start becoming more ambitious and therefore, more complicated.<br />
<br />
Before, the male protagonist Aki Tomoya was simply a diehard otaku charging on a mission that --admittedly-- was more self-satisfactory than collective. All the girls surrounding him were &quot;artists first, friends second&quot; in his eyes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315432">
        and he settled for simply being a fan. Regardless, his crew decided to play along only for the sake of the challenge and the friendships and the shared love for doujinshi. Now for Tomoya, being an otaku doesn&#039;t fly anymore. If he wants to take everything to the next level, he realizes that he has to be a proper producer-slash-creator-slash-artist because his crew is no longer a bunch of quirky, otaku, overtly hormonal teenage girls-- they are all professional artists who are just too damn good to stay being a fan. What happens when the doujin circle becomes too small for their talents? What happens when such talents are in jeopardy of being unable to grow?<br />
<br />
This is not to say that the Saekano series makes a drastic turn and becomes too serious. Trust me, all the classic dating sim satire and multiple shots of fan-service sequence are never running out of stock. Once again, the &#039;boring heroine&#039; Katou Megumi is a blast and constantly present in reminding us that Planet Earth is still the setting of this romantic chaos. However, it is truly a breathtaking experience seeing a simple piece of entertainment serve a pretty deep lesson on life. After all, as Saekano teaches us, there is no big difference between artists, imaginary girlfriends, and human beings: that growth is undeniable and there&#039;s always that next arc.<br />

    maybe that makes this anime interesting is the story line, yes of course where the scene of eriri &amp; utaha want to leave the group of game maker where the scene is in show that actually eriri &amp; utaha not want to leave the group game maker where the scene that makes me touched why so long group walking must release two members that are so valuable. I think in addition to the side of the story I also want to review about the art project, which I think this part is difficult to do from this anime I judge from the making of the

        image character 10/10 that makes this anime becomes more well again because this anime is made by studio that i like most. i will always wait whether saekano got seasson 3? and did the eriri and utaha accommodate the group making the Game?

    Ok, I am going to point the positive, neutral and negative aspects of this anime in topics. <br />
<br />
Negative:<br />
. Avoidable drama scenes. In addition, most of them are very similar to others from this same anime (even from season 1).<br />
. Romance scenes that wont go anywhere. They tease you over and over with those scenes which wont go anywhere. They make you always think that something will happen but would always deny it. This over and over becomes annoying. It&#039;s different from those where they play it in a way that you wont be expecting something coming from it, but if it happened that would be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323012">
        a (nice) bonus. <br />
. Generic and playing dense main male character (at least he isnt one of those who would stay shout -plot device- the whole anime letting the girls having all the lines). <br />
. Not a single character stands out (if I were to choose one who would detach from the others that would be Utaha. Michiru is nice to see but she does not have much screen time). <br />
. Repetitiveness. <br />
<br />
Neutral: <br />
. Fanservice / Ecchi.<br />
<br />
Positive:<br />
. The art? Well, It&#039;s a good looking art.<br />
. Fanservice and Ecchi (in my opinion).<br />
<br />
Well, I know this is a romcom + drama + harem anime but sincerely, those negative aspects took control over this anime in such a way i couldnt be even able to end the second season.<br />
<br />
So, since I have dropped this after watching 6 episodes things might change later on (which I doubt). Season 01 made relatively success so why would season 02 change? <br />
<br />
Anyway, this review is basically for those who have watched season 01, had the same opinion as me and wanted to confirm if worth trying watching season 02 or not.<br />
<br />
Basically, season 02 = season 01 and vice versa. <br />
<br />
PS.: Fanservice and ecchi aside, the only scene I truly enjoyed happened in episode 02, which was about Monogatari series reference.

    Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata was good... Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭ was better.<br />
<br />
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata&#039;s first season was something of a introduction to the dojin team of blessing software of Eriri, Utaha, Tomoya, Michiru and Megumi and finished once the entire team being recruited with half of their first game being done and it was a decent look at the visual novel industry by the eyes of fans turned creator-like anime. Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭ progress further from this by going through the character arcs that was sorely needed from the first season.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with Utaha Kasumigaoka where her arc has parallels to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250838">
        blessing software&#039;s game plotline to the situation of Utaha thinking of leaving blessing software due to her job being done thus she placed onto Tomoya&#039;s hands as a producer annnnnnnnd...her arc was saved by Megumi but nonetheless Utaha still had involvement after her arc ended was great as LA was already LA&#039;s best girl for this anime (something about her flirting and teasing and just her silver tongue just had something appealing for a character...like Hitagi Senjougahara without her killing yandere intent). Eriri&#039;s arc was more focused on her &quot;artist block&quot; and it helped her as a character as well as Tomoya as a producer for blessing software in trying to help Eriri get out of her funk. As much as Eriri&#039;s arc in the first season made her out to be a jealous tsundere spoiled childhood friend archetype this arc definitely helped albeit LA is slightly biased towards Eriri as a character due to LA&#039;s affiliation and liking to Utaha more, nonetheless Eriri&#039;s dilemma about her unable to make illustrations and the creative block she had was a good arc for her. Megumi&#039;s arc was short in a ways but nonetheless she had more intimate moments with Tomoya throughout this season but also Megumi showed one glaring problem with Tomoya to herself and that was Tomoya didn&#039;t ask for her help even though she clearly asked him several times leading to &quot;what is the point of thrusting Megumi into the world of otaku and visual novels, if your not gonna use her&quot; and thankfully was something Tomoya repaid and gave Megumi more development outside from her archetype...of having no archetype and being original and new. <br />
<br />
The final arc introduced us to Akane Kosaka voiced by Hitomi Nabatame wanting to scout out Eriri and Utaha after blessing software finished their game and this leads to a crossroads for Tomoya and blessing software&#039;s future (as well as now not having anyone to lean on for help), though this final arc is centred around Tomoya losing two of his main developers but it also granted Tomoya to step up and be the producer even after they leave though trying to get back Megumi and LA actually doesn&#039;t blame Eriri and Utaha leaving to find bigger fish and their careers were on the line to go and do better things and LA doubt they would be spiteful to Tomoya considering all the effort he did to be a better producer in the long run to do so (and also their part of Tomoya&#039;s harem). However as LA says this, the final episode does kind of spit in LA&#039;s face at the aforementioned statement about Eriri and Utaha leaving but through a different cause and Utaha&#039;s spontaneity might have saved this finale but still the sentiments in LA statement rather stupid as a result and makes the finale look like a typical light novel ending.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation done once again A1-Pictures, the animation was great from the character designs to backgrounding and even the coloration of the scene to make it look more striking is back from the first season as well as the self-aware camera during the fanservice moments...especially Utaha&#039;s *ahem* nonetheless, the animation was superb from A1-Pictures even with them cutting corners at times.<br />
<br />
Going off on a little tangent as LA KNOWS someone might brings this up, but what&#039;s the difference between you favouring Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata over Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu?, well that is actually quite easy, aside from both being the same scthick of characters with certain professions wanting to create a visual novel in high school, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata had the edge with not only with his meta-humour and even using it&#039;s meta-humour to talk about visual novel and it&#039;s processes, it&#039;s characters also meant something to do or even outside of melodrama and their problems in creating something such as a visual novel. Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu on the other hand used it&#039;s characters haphazardly to the point certain characters were used more as gimmick and their melodrama were more focused on a romantic-edge than a creative one. Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata also wins easily because of it&#039;s likable characters and atmosphere, Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu only brought out it&#039;s melodrama for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭ is a definite watch for those Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata fans and probably even more to the harem member of your choice (sans Michiru..she&#039;s the shameless incest fanservice girl in this season with hardly a focus on her as her arc finished in the first season) with drama that means something in the long run both from a character perspective as well as the creative and character relations developing even further from it&#039;s predecessors. Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭ may have it&#039;s problems (especially when it comes to which harem member you like the most and how that affects your alternate character implications to this second season) but this is a conflicted strong end to an anime series that liked to jab at character archetypes WITH a certain characters with no archetype.<br />
<br />
Utaha Kasumigaoka is still best girl of this anime AND for LA&#039;s Waifu of Spring 2017 because of this season though...

    Whaaaat? Are you telling me that Saekano has now an actual plot and that it&#039;s not just your average ecchi harem comedy anymore?<br />
Yeah, you&#039;ve read it right, the secon season of Saekano was a good surprise, the first episodes continued where the first season left and as it continued the characters have shown some development, especially the girls. Even Katou abandoned her flat self for some time, and this is huge. <br />
This season is way better than the first one. Yeah, there are still those ecchi shoots and there&#039;s still lots of fanservice, but the story has its important role now. The last episodes really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250670">
        gave a good twist to this series and I&#039;m glad for that. <br />
The art and sound are still ok, as in the first season.<br />
The end was baffling though, but I&#039;ll be really looking forward to watching a third season. <br />
<br />
One last thing: Katou best girl.

    The best harem anime i have watch. At first, you will thought it is only mainstream harem anime, with bad romance and a lot of service. But trust me, it only for introduction. The main story appear in season 2. <br />
<br />
The story is very well build, with a plot twist in climax part. But it is very important for characterization. Don&#039;t doubt about art and music, because it produced by A-! Pictures<br />
<br />
So, if you&#039;r looking harem anime, i absolutely recommended it. Although it is not the best, it is veeerrryyyy good romance comedy drama Anime.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
also, i will tell you that 3 ship that sail in

    I have a hard time really coming to terms with the impact that this anime left on me after watching it. I&#039;ve been gracious to a lot of anime over my time watching, but nothing has ever been the completely 10 out of 10 that Saekano Flat ended up being. The first season was good, and I expected more of the same...and got something a lot better. I don&#039;t really think I&#039;ve ever watched something western or otherwise, whether is be a cartoon or live action product, that had a story that looked as good as it was told.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t know I had been craving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277728">
        a ecchi harem that would subvert being over sexualized and comedic, but low and behold, watching Saekano showed me I truly was. The way these character&#039;s stories intertwined, the way it treats having a creative mind, and taking your abilities seriously...It worked so well together. Plus, on the romantic side of things, it&#039;s incredibly satisfying to see an anime where there are several women you could see the MC end up with and actually be completely fine with any choice.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time even thinking up the words to bring this program justice. That&#039;s why I will keep it brief. Watch Saekano Flat. Watch Saekano 1 as well. Open your mind to a story about friendship, coming to terms with your feelings, the uplifting nature of seeing others succeed, and being the best that you can possibly be in your field of choice.

    Harem&#039;s aren&#039;t really my genre, because I guess guilty pleasure but for some reasons I find myself enjoying this season and so I&#039;ll tell you why, his is just a personal oppinion though.<br />
<br />
Plot<br />
<br />
While season 1 focuses on the Harem plot where girls just goes around with out otaku Tomoya, this season is quite different, for me aside from the harem it tells us how hard it is to create something, we can see the casts suffer from slumps and rejected ideas and although we&#039;ve seen this in other animes I still find it well executed.<br />
<br />
The Romance are stll there, nothing really new but I do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250731">
        wanna say that the they are really showing us flags on who will win and if you don&#039;t know who she is then ......A Coquina clutch for you.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
now here&#039;s the heart of the sereis the casts, I can say that they are developed but I think they still need a room for improvement. <br />
<br />
Tomoya- yes at first he&#039;s just your typical harem MC-kun who all of a sudden has his own harem, but in this seaon you&#039;&#039;ll both love and hate him, although what he did is normal for me considering there is no such thing as a perfect character, I like tomoya is getting matured episode although it&#039;s rushed, and I like the fact that he is quick t orealize his mistakes and will try hard and will even support his cicle no matter what.<br />
<br />
Megumi- the main heroine, well I think for the characters here she has the most  obvious chaacter development, at the begining she just forced to join but in the end she ends up having the most passion and commitment in finishing the game, and the way how she steals the show everytime I find it unannoyin actually.<br />
<br />
Utaha and Eriri- since they&#039;re both rivals i think I should combine them, I still think they need room for development although they have quite matured since before they are just only after tomoya, I&#039;m glad that they&#039;re starting to think what&#039;s next for them and they manaaged to make decisions based on what will happen to them.<br />
<br />
Iori- Tying with Megumi is this guy, he also has an very obvious character development and I won&#039;t say it to avid spoilers but all I can say is that I really liked him in this epiosde...also....PLEASE PAIR HIM WITH EITHER ERIRI OR MICHIRU<br />
<br />
Michiru and Izumi- since they got the least screentime all i can say is that If there&#039;s a season 3 they could have much more screentime, despite being just there they are likable enough.<br />
<br />
Sound and Animation: the animation is great and I like in season 1 I still like the character designs particularly Utaha and Kato, for sound It&#039;s nice I enjoyed the ending though<br />
<br />
Overall saekano is the sereis that looks bland is actually matued at least for me lol though a room for improvement is still needed...I highly reccomend it

    Ok, so I&#039;ve just ended the sequel of Saekano, and thought it might be cliche at one point it  does have some development of sorts, and here&#039;show I rate it:<br />
<br />
Good 7, Story:<br />
It may have it&#039;s share of cliche but, in this sequel it has a certain degree of development, where we see, the break up of the Blessing Software group, that starts when Utaha graduates and when a new girl, Izumi arrives as one girl leaves, what adds to my rating was seeing Eri leave the group and this is where Mr. Ethical starts to contemplate as he struggle to move on without the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252288">
        2 most valuable members of his group, not surprising since this anime story plot revolves around a philosophy theme, that things would not always stay the same whether you like it or not. <br />
<br />
fair 6, art:<br />
Ok so there were some indications of them girl looking very bitchy with their school uniforms, the characters maybe the same, but don be expecting to see some of Eri&#039;s panchira moments nor see anything else that would titillate your adrenaline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mediocre 5,  Sound:<br />
<br />
Ok so it was the same seiyuus who did the voices of them characters, so what? I don&#039;t both like closing and opening themes.<br />
<br />
Very Good 8 , characters:<br />
<br />
Now that we see some development , we can&#039;t ignore the other added characters in this sequel like the antagonist  Akane Kosaka who was instrumental of making both Eri and Utaha do more better, but there were times that the competitions for the Blessing Software group were annoying and overrated, but then again it does make their role good, also seeing the part where the relationship between the 2 girls and Mr.Ethical becomes more on a certain romantic degree, but it was Megumi who mad such impact in fact she is the only one who remain with Mr. Ethical all throughout despite of the fact that she just a mascot or just a model for Eri&#039;s illustrations, though I would have love to see some of that arc between her and Mr.Ethical develop into a more romantic sense. But then again being this boring girlfriend it was just enough that she has to keep him guessing so basically my score was for her alone. But it was quite unfair that Michru was push aside was given a very short supporting role, she could have added something if only original creator Misaki Kurehito did something about her character.<br />
<br />
fair 6, Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Frankly, the whole nine yards of this sequel can be pretty boring at times , and there were times that just watching it can be a chore, but once I&#039;ve got to the few last episode that is were  my interest peaked up.<br />
<br />
Very good 8, Overall:<br />
<br />
Ok, so seeing the Blessing Software group break up before they can even continue making more success because of Utaha and Eri&#039;s plan to go to the other side for better challenges was disappointing , but it wasn&#039;t always that we get to see such disappointment of the part of Mr. Ethical when 2 of his most valuable assets go to the other side that has served as a rude awakening for him to let them go and move on so that he can do better, so basically  that was disappointingly very good, even though  both Utaha and Eri missed their train that was nothing more of a comedy gag, so don&#039;t expect an season 3 of this thing since it wouldn&#039;t be a good fit. <br />
<br />
Pres.Thrump OUT!!!!

    That ending kiled me ;-;<br />
<br />
This long-awaited (for me) second season was into so much doubt within the comunity because of the filler moments in the fisrt one. However, this demonstrated that A-1 Pictures can make good anime once in a while.<br />
<br />
As I haven&#039;t read any of the original light novel I&#039;ll be reviewing the series as it is by itself. A generic eviroment and setting with unique characters and weird but still natural development.<br />
<br />
In the first season I just watched it because I was going into harem stuff. But the fact that the main heroine was Megumi since ever made me think harem anime aren&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250715">
        all about a guy who bangs every girl with presence.<br />
<br />
The story itself wasn&#039;t all that original nor ordinary. A guy who recruits talented classmates who also are in love with him just don&#039;t happen in real life. But this is not the case with Megumi, who started as just a passerby. In the first season the team build their relationships. But in this second season we see each one developing as if every one of them was the main character. We see them joy and then suffer, also how they overcome the difficulties. And in the end, they make some big decissions that gets the anime upside down. Although, I&#039;d really like to see a third season because a spoiler someone told me from the light novel ;-;<br />
<br />
The artstyle is just as generic as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. But A-1 managed to add their little touch to some scenes, either making a shot with only one primal color, or just making fun of other works like the Monogatari Series. I found these eyecandy&#039;s quite enjoyable, and kept me from getting my eyes bored.<br />
<br />
The background music wasn&#039;t really memorable, but it makes the anime flow naturally and the tracks chosed for almost every type of moment (either dramatic or comedic) really fit there. The OP was good, but I think the animation for that, even if it seems made by freelancer animators, was beautiful. Specially when they changed an element depending on its state in the story.<br />
<br />
All the characters, except from Megumi and Akane, have a extremely generic surface. At the begining it was awful to see those stereotypes being reused once again, but then we fall back with they way they grow as individuals. I really like Megumi. She was weird in the first season, because of her forced lack of presence. But after the first season, her unnoticable personality came afloat. And everytime she appeared on screen, she seemed more open to others, and of course, to Tomoya. When I saw the last scenes of the last episode I really couldn&#039;t stop laughing. Megumi is my very favorite female character of this season.<br />
<br />
I give the anime an overall of 9 because some moments that felt off, some bad animated frames and the tipical A-1&#039;s bad 3D. But this is a really good anime that anyone can enjoy (if they watch the whole first season)

    This keeps up to par with the last season and introduces new development by building off of what happened last season. Megumi is still kind of salty, Eriri is worn out and Utaha has something new to focus on. Despite all that, our MC wants to get everyone back together for another game, Cherry Blessing lives on. Rivalry is still apparent in this one but with different characters in different ways. <br />
<br />
These characters have been driven apart but learn to still be friends and such, decisions as well as sacrifices must be made in order for them to be happy with their lives after the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314940">
        game&#039;s release. It has to do with dealing with the loss of some people in the team just as well as the new opportunities that arose from Cherry Blessing.<br />
<br />
Also side note: Just wanted to say how much I like Utaha once again, how she bounces her leg or fidgets when agitated or thinking, talks about how writing a story is, as well as the tests she has to go through this season.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a bit thrown off by the end especially with the romance route they decided (I have a bone to pick) but soon there will be a movie so for another time. It leaves you with the idea that there&#039;s a different but bright future ahead for our characters so we&#039;ll see.

    I am new to anime, but so far as i live i only interested in watching a Action, Sci-Fi, and genres related to that, i didnt watch any love=comedy or harem anime because its boring? really i cant stand watching an &quot;everyday life&quot; of someone, why dont u just do it in real life? but this one is an exception i dont know you all veteran think but this anime draw me to watch it from season1 to 2 and i hope it get season 3 as well as i dont want the story to be end so soon (23 eps included season 1 but,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250896">
        well)<br />
<br />
Story(9) :<br />
The story you could say in real life it was a normal one like, joining a club, and creating the game together. The differences is when the club(produciton house) is all girl and got only 1 boy and all the girl character has its own background story with out main character and try to show their appeal in their different ways<br />
<br />
Art(10) :<br />
The Art is amazing! The coloring and that building details, the light around the saenai world the style of clothing that is so variable and the background so-realistic make me realize that they do take this anime seriously, the character all was shining in the world of saenai that they create even the side character were all beautifull<br />
<br />
Sound(8) :<br />
well for standarn sound for every sound in the saenai world are all good nothing missing its sound, GLISTENINGb by Megumi really fit for climax, it is good but other song didnt move me, only one song that move me.<br />
<br />
Character(8) :<br />
I heard that the character are mocking of Tsundere, Yandere, Kuudere and somewhat like that??? Well if they are then maybe its basic personality, but in some way the character here are different and is unique compared to other anime with that personality, well who know? i didnt watch other anime about school romance, what i can say is they do really know how to create cute girl and appealing personality that can move your heart(mine)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9) :<br />
Like i said before, well i didnt bored watch this series so i could say yes. I Really enjoy this series it well made<br />
<br />
Overall(9) :<br />
Well i can say that this anime is worth to watch. They(One Main heroine) do sometimes critize about the anime itself witch is that the creator know that they was not perfect afterall that means they&#039;re humble and tries their best to create this anime. So if you havent watch this anime yet. Time to Order the Blu-Ray ^^
