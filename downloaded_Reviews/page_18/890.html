    If there have been any worries about the future of the idol genre, Love Live 2 has dispelled them. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to deny that the first season of Love Live began with a rocky start. There wasn&#039;t much to set itself apart from other idol shows (especially with the likes of Idolmaster and Aikatsu dominating the genre) and it fell prone to melodrama far more than it should have. But, much like K-ON&#039;s mediocre first season and excellent second season, Love Live 2 has managed to do more than improve upon its predecessor - it has genuinely become an amazing anime. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149921">
        was no fan of the franchise when the TV series made its debut in early 2013. I dropped it after the first episode aired and wondered later on what people saw in the series. But now having finished the second season, Love Live has become one of my favourite anime franchises. <br />
<br />
Certainly it is not an anime that will test the mind or change anyone&#039;s life. It is simply a story of nine teenage girls forming an idol group together. However, it would be an insult to describe Love Live as yet another &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; anime, as it is a far more meaningful experience. The drama feels genuine this time around, and by the end it is hard to prevent the tears from rolling when the story of μ&#039;s reaches its end. <br />
<br />
From the very first episode of the second season, it is clear that Sunrise has made a significant effort to improve the series. It looks better, sounds better, feels better and is far more fun to watch. Most importantly, the girls of μ&#039;s all feel like genuine characters now. Honoka&#039;s passion makes her truly seem like the leader and centre of the group, whereas the first season didn&#039;t have much reason beyond &quot;well, somebody had to be the leader, right?&quot; Even the characters who were given little to no screen-time in the first season (Rin, Eli, Nozomi and Hanayo) are fleshed and given their own episode to shine. It is finally a story about the nine of them. <br />
<br />
Considering there have only been twenty-six episodes to develop a cast of nine characters, Sunrise has done a commendable job of doing so without neglecting the story in return. Perhaps the characters could have benefited from another season of episodes, but they hardly feel lacking by the end. The addition of a rival idol group (A-RISE) also makes the story feel less insular. It is no longer confined to the school itself, and with the school&#039;s closure no longer being an issue, the girls can finally focus on performing as idols do. <br />
<br />
Nico is easily one of the show&#039;s greatest assets. Sure, her &quot;nico nico-nii&quot; catchphrase is cute and all (I go a little bit crazy whenever she utters it), but Nico&#039;s presence accomplishes far more than simply being a vehicle for the cute. Of all the character-focused episodes, Nico&#039;s is the greatest. It shows that she really, truly cares about the group and is not simply in it for pride and ego. The idol industry is Nico&#039;s life, the act of being an idol her most treasured dream. She cares deeply for her siblings and performs primarily to make them smile. She&#039;s a kind person inside- contrary to her rough behaviour with the rest of μ&#039;s. Perhaps that behaviour may make her somewhat unsuitable for the role of an idol, but she&#039;s more serious about it than anyone else. Nico may not be idealised as idols usually are, but that flawed, genuinely human side of her makes her makes her all the more loveable, I think. Even if she does not resonate with you as a character, it&#039;s hard to deny that she at least provides an interesting contrast with the rest of μ&#039;s. It would not be anywhere near as interesting without her.<br />
<br />
The story peaks in the last four episodes. With the graduation of the third-years quickly drawing closer, a tear-filled goodbye seems inevitable. It is very similar to the final episodes of K-ON&#039;s second season. With the prospect of Nico leaving and μ&#039;s potentially being disbanded after graduation, I could not help but feel my chest tighten a bit. And then the final episode really drove those feelings home. Perhaps they&#039;ll join together once again and find careers as professional idols. I doubt it is the end for Nico, Eli and Honoka.<br />
<br />
Like most idol anime, Love Live has a fantastic soundtrack. All the songs the girls perform carry their own theme and message, and none of them (aside from the opening and ending) are used more than once in the anime. Each song represents a new stage for μ&#039;s, another step forward as performers and as people. The music peaks with the performance of &quot;Snow Halation&quot; in the ninth episode, a rising, sad yet uplifting piece that showcases the appeal of μ&#039;s. It is probably one of the best vocal tracks I have heard in an anime to date. There is also a really cool scene at the end of the 12th episode that I won&#039;t spoil. Everything with the music sorts of &#039;clicks&#039; in that moment. <br />
<br />
It should be noted though that the ninth episode does blunder a bit with its choice of music. As the second-years traverse through a snowstorm, there is an incredibly melodramatic, orchestral piece blasting in the background that would feel more appropriate were demons from hell rising up and setting Earth on fire or something. The second season has improved so much that it is frustrating to see it regress to the first season&#039;s melodrama, even for just a brief moment. <br />
<br />
As for the visuals, Love Live looks well above average. The CGI during the performances can be a little bit distracting (and I know some people despise CGI of any form) but between that and low frame-rate, off-model animation, I would gladly take the CGI. It certainly looks better than Aikatsu&#039;s CGI, anyway. The rest of the visuals on the other hand holds up reasonably well. There are scenes here and there where lazy, static shots are used for longer than necessary, and while it certainly is no Attack on Titan, Love Live looks just fine. <br />
<br />
Love Live has come a long way from its slow beginnings. While it will hardly convert anyone who detests the &#039;moe&#039; art style, those who have even the slightest inkling of interest in the series will likely find the second season to be at the very top of the idol (and perhaps even music) genre. An anime can be both cute and a genuinely great story, as is demonstrated here. <br />
<br />
Now, where&#039;s my Nico spin-off?

    After finishing 1st Season of Love Live: School Idol Project, I must say, Season 2 sure stepped up it&#039;s game. I enjoyed Season 1 a lot too, but Season 2 has just been something else for me.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don&#039;t know, Love Live: School Idol Project is based off of a real live idol group called Nine Muses. They all go by different names in the anime itself, but it&#039;s a pretty neat concept. Their goal in Season 1 is to keep the school from shutting down by forming an idol group.<br />
<br />
In Season 2, their goal is to make the Love Live, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review148119">
        win it all, this will be the last chance for them to do this together as members of the group are graduating after their third year.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Simply, I don&#039;t like many music/idol animes. They stray too far away from the main plot. Often times, they become too focused on being cute, and adorable, much like K-On! did, and steer away from the story as a whole, and for me that&#039;s a complete turnoff. With Love Live: School Idol Project, I have not had to worry about that at all. The story is not really comedic in any form, which in turn makes the quality that much better as it truly focuses on it being a slice of life anime, rather then throwing little &quot;hilarious&quot; moments all over the place.<br />
<br />
In Season 2, we see a lot more drama, heartache, and realization. After eating through all 13 episodes, it&#039;s been nothing short of emotional, and I love it.  The theme stays the same, where they&#039;re all dedicated to making the best of their school idol group while they can, and they continue to have a goal in mind that they can strive for together. <br />
<br />
The art is once again fantastic, other than, in my opinion the 3D they use for their performances. I dislike 3D animation, but that&#039;s my preference. Other than that, I thought it was really good. I love the costumes they wear during their performances as well.<br />
<br />
The sound, well, if you&#039;re watching an anime about school idols, I&#039;m pretty sure you expect good music, and this is nothing short of that. Snow Halation, one of the songs they perform in this season, was just phenomenal (And it&#039;s a real song by Nine Muse&#039;s, check it out!). I personally enjoy the music they sing, and the BGM is well placed.<br />
<br />
Characters, well, there&#039;s nine of them, so I&#039;m not going to run through each one as I&#039;d probably do a messy job anyways. I&#039;ll just say that each one of these characters, Nico, Nozomi, Eli, Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Rin, Hayano, and Maki are all unique characters in their group. They all have had struggles (As seen in season 1) and coming into season 2 that&#039;s no different, however, they have developed incredibly over the span of this season. They&#039;ve all conquered certain issues with themselves, and they&#039;ve done this together as a group. That&#039;s one of the huge striking points for me, is that no matter what situation they&#039;re in, they figure it out together, and they&#039;re all there for one another whenever it&#039;s called for. Easily the characters are the strongest point within this anime.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, I&#039;ve never really enjoyed an anime that&#039;s been centred around music much like Love Live. This has been such a fun ride for myself, and while I don&#039;t think this anime is for everyone, I&#039;d fully recommend you at least give it a try. I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ll connect with the characters in one way or another, and that&#039;s one of the many reasons this anime is so special.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever cried such happy tears before. Best choice I made watching this series, all because of a Nico-Ni .gif.<br />

    When Love Live! School Idol Project first aired in Japan, it became a hit sensation, captivating the hearts of many. The show was surprisingly good, with an enjoyable cast, entertaining songs, and a solid story. It was a massive success, and with its popularity came a second season. This might make some people feel anxious, thinking this to be a sell out for more money, but their worries can be put to ease; regardless of its intentions, I believe this second season to be even greater than the first time around.<br />
<br />
Spoilers for the first season to follow.<br />

Love Live! School Idol Project Second Season follows μ’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149665">
        as they get a second chance at the Love Live idol competition after their withdrawal from the first. Beyond that however, the girls are forced to look farther ahead and contemplate the future of μ’s as the third year’s graduation begins to rapidly approach. The story isn’t anything too original, but that’s overshadowed by the fact that it’s done well. Love Live!’s second season will make you laugh and feel good, but at the same time it can bring you to tears. There is a lot of emotion packed into its later episodes, and when the season comes to a close, you won’t want to see them go. The story is brought to a finish with an ending that wraps everything up nicely, making it a satisfying journey from beginning to end. <br />
<br />
μ’s brings multiple main characters to the table, so there’s a guarantee you’ll love at least one of them, if not all of them. From genki girl Honoka to narcissistic Nico, there’s a lot of variety to be had. More important than that, however, is that the show still manages to bring some depth and development to these characters despite there being so many. The spotlight is given to the girls who weren’t featured during the first season, such as Nico and Rin, but development still continues for the others, such as in Honoka and Umi. Add to that some nice side characters like all the imoutos, as well as some actual presence from the rival idol group A-RISE, not to mention those amazing alpacas, and it is clear that the show does a wonderful job with its loveable cast. <br />
<br />
Of course, this being an idol show and all, the music is a major component of this show, and I feel it doesn’t fail in this regard. The OP and ED are pretty good, matching the feel of the series quite well. The insert songs are really the standout though, with a mood and lyrics that depict the moments of the show magnificently. My favorite of the bunch definitely has to be “Snow Halation”; when it is being sung, I had shivers going down my spine. Of course, the rest of the bunch is great too, such as “Aishteru Banzai”, “Love &amp; Peace”, and even a return of the opening of the first season, which is tied in nicely. The soundtrack is pretty great as well fitting the mood nicely and bringing the tension and emotion when it needs to be brought. Overall, the music of the series is great, as it should be.<br />
<br />
The character designs are all nice to look at, and there’s probably going to be a design that you love because of the massive cast. The animation runs smoothly for the most part, and can be pretty beautiful at times as well, such as during the performance of the aforementioned “Snow Halation”. One problem that I did have with this show, however, is the CG that is used during the song performances. It is pretty jarring and takes away from what would otherwise be beautiful scenes. Thankfully, the usage of the CG has decreased and the quality has increased slightly from the last season, so it wasn’t as bad as before, but I still wasn’t a big fan of it. Other than that though, this is quite a beautiful show to look at.<br />
<br />
All in all, this was a very entertaining show to watch. Even with the bothersome CG, watching the girls of μ’s working to win the Love Live and performing their songs was a wonderful experience. This second season made me fall in love with μ’s even more than the first season had. Anyone who liked the first season will definitely love this; even if you didn’t, I feel as though the second season was a great step up from the first, so you might still enjoy it. While the story is brought to a close for now, I can’t wait to see what the Love Live! series has in store for us next.<br />

    Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season<br />
<br />
Love Live! have a simple story, it tells us about 9 girls that competing in a School Idol Competition. Well, if we look deeply to the main idea of the story, Love Live does not have an originality.  Although not having an originality, the story is full of excitement, the plot have a great balance between the main story and the fillers. <br />
<br />
As for the art, we have a clear and beautiful animation, despite having a CG during dancing and stage performing, Love Live! have a well-produced animation.<br />
<br />
What can I say about the sound? Is wonderful in my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164501">
        opinion, the seiyuu did an excellent job to bring such character to the screen, everyone have a decent voice and brings uniqueness to the characters. The songs in the series are very good indeed.<br />
<br />
With a slice of life genre in hands, a development is the strongest body of this anime. <br />
Each character has their own story/ problem, it makes the developments successfully makes a deep character.  Each of them has a unique personality itself. <br />
<br />
Besides that, Love Live is not for everyone, the main attraction of the series is aimed to the male audience. Some of the female viewers maybe not really enjoy the series, there are also people that don&#039;t like idols founds out Love Live not interesting. As for myself, I enjoy the series although not fully enjoying it. It is fully recommended to those who seeks an idol genre.

    Love Live! School Idol Project Season 2 - <br />
Recommend of read a review or watch season 1 before reading this.<br />
<br />
Love Live! is a Comedy, Idol anime co-created by music label Lantis and animation studio Sunrise, with it&#039;s second season was release in April of 2014. It continues from the end of season 1 (Which i also reviewed), where Honoka Kōsaka and her friends in the school idol group μ&#039;s (Muse) tries to enter the second Love live, a school idol tournament that has changed because of success of the first one, has become national wide as idol groups from around Japan compete to be the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185940">
        best school idol group. The girls from Muse know this their last chance to do enter Love Live as next school year, three of it members will graduate and can&#039;t be part of the group anymore. So thats the plot of the season 2, it still as funny as season 1 and the episodes are very interesting and keeps you watching.<br />
Next is the characters.<br />
Honoka Kōsaka (Voiced by Emi Nitta), is the main character and leader of μ&#039;s, her family owns a sweet shop.In the season 2 she becomes the student council president by Eli&#039;s request. She is very cheerful and never gives up on anything,<br />

She normally have her head in the clouds but she is kind hearted. She is μ&#039;s wardrobe designer and one of it&#039;s choreographers.<br />

She becomes the student council vice-president after being requested by Nozomi at the start of season 2. She acts as the voice of reason to group and she leads the practice sessions.<br />

She also has a very unique way of cheering up the other group members.She is one of the girls that graduates at the end of the year. <br />

Nico Yazawa (Voiced by Sora Tokui), is a girl who looks up to idols and wishes to become one herself. She is μ&#039;s wardrobe supervisor with Kotori. She is one of the girls that graduates at the end of the year. <br />
Next is presentation.<br />
Season 2 has had a visual improvement to season 1 as everything has more color and detail.The art style has mostly stayed the same just the colors used a more vast. The animation has improved aswel with the song/dance scenes have more fluid motions and the facial animation look better and look more believably than before. The songs for this season are as catchy as they was in season 1 and the voice acting is still great as each voice still fits it&#039;s character like in season 1. The topics used has better impact than season 1 because most of the episode shows how much work they put into Love Live contest.<br />
Lasty is my opinion.<br />
Season 2 of Love Live! is a improvement i terms of presentation and story, Sunrise impress me again with their story writing as it keep you interested and animation design as the song/dance scenes are more beautiful than they was in season 1. The amount of work and love put in the anime really shows even better in this season. I enjoyed this season more than the last season and i said in my review of season 1 it was one my favorites, and season 2 joins that list. <br />
Now the Verdict.<br />
Season 2 of Love Live! is a great improvement over season 1 in every way with time spend on improving the visuals and animation. The songs/dance scenes are great to watch and the art style look more better than ever. So with that said, i recommend you give Love Live! Season 2 a watch if you watch season 1 as it very enjoyable and the songs/dances are great to see as the animation looks lovely created. Love Live! season 2 is one of the best animes release in the last year so you should give it a watch.

    The second part of Love Live explores the developments µ&#039;s as they continue to grow and mature after the aftermath of the first Love Live competition and their rebounding. After quickly getting hooked on by their songs and the hilarious antics that goes on within µ&#039;s, I was delighted to find the second season one-upping its prequel and going above and beyond with µ&#039;s performances in the second Love Live tournament. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
Compared to last season, the story is way better, although its the same premise, the group entered in smarter and wiser. Something this season did do differently from its prequel was focus more on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354124">
        the songs, but more on that later. <br />
As the story progresses, the team starts to deal with the inevitable truth that their group can only last so long, and through this, the story places an emphasis on the 2nd year trio, being caught directly in the centre of the dilemma. Because of the emotional connection the anime previously established with their first season, the second season went above and beyond to use that emotional connection to create a captivating story and ultimately a very meaningful and heavy ending. The climb to the climax is also extremely well done and had me firmly on the edge of my seat. Not only because the songs are such absolute bangers, but because of how much the characters matured throughout the journey. <br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Comparing to last season, the character developments are much better, and when combined with the developments made in the previous season, makes the entire cast feel like a real group of girls singing their hearts out. <br />
Honoka has now become the Student Council President. A role presumably bestowed upon her by previous president Eli because she is graduating. While this sudden decision had most of us completely baffled, her new leadership role ultimately becomes beneficial for the team because it forces her to mature and step into a leadership role, something that she didn&#039;t do much last season. This ultimately gives us firm markers to see just how much she&#039;s come since the day she proposed to form µ&#039;s. <br />
While the other 2nd years didn&#039;t receive as much development compared to last year, the show still obliged by giving us a small arc with Umi, Kotori, and Maki suffering from an Artist&#039;s Block during the team&#039;s training camp. <br />
Rin became one of the more definite highlights in character development, as we dive deep into her opinions on her outer image. This has been touched on by the previous season, but not fully developed. However, in this season, the anime fully put Rin in the spotlight by forcing her onto a position she wants, but she doesn&#039;t admit she does. We get to see Rin beneath all her nya~&#039;s and see her mature and grow. Hanayo also, in turn, develops as Rin&#039;s best friend, this time taking a leadership role instead of being pushed around to do things to help her best friend express her true feelings. <br />
The focus in the 3rd years this season revolves around Nozomi and Nico. With Nico&#039;s arc we see a predictable yet surprising side of her, but also a side of her that we never even seen before. With the introduction of her younger siblings and how she&#039;s juggling Idol duties and responsibility of being the eldest sister, we see Nico in a new light, and ultimately makes us respect her signature Nico Nico Nii just a bit more. <br />
Nozomi&#039;s arc, despite being a tad bit rushed, still gives us insight into her motives. Despite not seeing a new side of her, we get further insight into the current side of Nozomi we all know. Why she gave µ&#039;s their name, why she joined, and just how much Nozomi planned to make sure her friend Eli could lighten up and learn the value of friendship. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound<br />
If anyone&#039;s ever listened to µ&#039;s music, they will know that the second season has the best tracks that the entire Love Live series has ever known. However, there are a few I&#039;d like to place a highlight on. <br />
First, the undisputed most popular song µ&#039;s has ever released, Snow Halation. As mentioned in the anime, Snow Halation is µ&#039;s first attempt at a love song, comprised of lyrics written by the entire group. When they performed it, the animation was at its peak. The passive lighting the blue gates give to the group, their dance choreography, and even the way the actors sang. It stayed true to its lyrics, simultaneously driving a knife in our hearts and warming it past its boiling point.  Second is Bokura Wa Ima No Naka De, which many may recognize as the Season One OP. When they made the callback to this song by performing it in the Love Live competition, I was completely floored, suddenly, everything the group did up to that point made sense, as the OP suddenly took on a new meaning as the epitome, the peak, the highest point µ&#039;s has ever achieved. Callbacks to original season OPs aren&#039;t a new concept, but the way Love Live pulled it off made it that much more special. <br />
<br />
Overall, season 2 went above and beyond, driving the group up past the highest point. it was extremely pleasing to see them grow so high, and ultimately, make the results that much more worth it.

    Love Live! School Idol Project is a slice of life musical anime, about nine high school girls joining together in a hit new craze, becoming school idols! Eventually they will compete with many other schools nationwide in Love Live, to see which idol group is the best of them all. It&#039;s not all for fun though, for the main goal of competing in Love Live for out girls is to become popular enough to get more registered students for the school or have the school be closed down next year.<br />
<br />
Love Live! School Idol Project&#039;s nine girls are all lovable in their own way, and of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343490">
        course by the end of your time watching it, you might have a &quot;best girl&quot; of your choice. The girls when on stage are well animated with great songs and dance choreography to really shine on stage. Off the stage each girl continue their days of high school youth, whether it&#039;s at practice, home, out for fun, or any other matter of activity. <br />
<br />
The girls are overflowing with charm and lovable quirks, with also some witty humor spread out through the whole anime. It is one of the few musical focused pieces of media that I can recommend to people and adore in my own way, the biggest strength of the entire experience of course being the well fleshed out personalities of each girl, with their own struggles they wish to overcome in hopes of achieving their dream. To be not just school idols, but true idols, for the world, friends, family, and each other.<br />
<br />
Love Live! School Idol Project takes place within Tokyo, and our nine girls compete against many other schools in the area for the chance to be winners in the Love Live competition. There is however another group of girls out on a remote coast, who will soon gather together to compete in Love Live! 5 years later... Love Live! Sunshine!!<br />
Most of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we&#039;re given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn&#039;t get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member&#039;s influence on one another. Whether it&#039;s to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s this strong focus on µ&#039;s as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they&#039;re not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that—into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.<br />
Rivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of µ&#039;s to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it&#039;s proof that µ&#039;s has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.<br />
<br />
From the uplifting yet melancholic &quot;Snow Halation&quot; to the rosy &quot;Aishiteru Banzai!&quot;, Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I&#039;m sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it&#039;s the same adorable art that I&#039;ve grown to love, and I don&#039;t think that needs to change.<br />
<br />
When I reflect back on my journey with µ&#039;s and School Idol Project, I really couldn&#039;t have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I&#039;m their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give µ&#039;s a listen.<br />
<br />
Many music and memories are awaiting you!

    Success stories have always had a spirit that the Academy and many others have deemed inextinguishable. The soul and passion of the fight to victory has always had an undeniable effect on us humans, who have always had the hidden spirit of desire; the very desire to go the extra mile and make it to the top. And it is in these stories where we see this undeniable burning human passion. We see it in Daniel&#039;s eyes in his final match in the Karate Kid. We see it in Rocky, prepared to fight Apollo Creed with everything he has. We see it in Drumline, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206381">
        the monolithic stage overshadows our heroes. We see it in Alan Turing in his struggle to break Enigma in the Imitation Game.<br />
<br />
We see it in μ&#039;s, in their fight to the Love Live Championships.<br />
<br />
Love Live Season Two is an anime that has been described by most as &#039;better than season one&#039; or &#039;the best idol anime ever&#039; but the series has gone above and beyond those simple standards and has become one of the most inspiring success stories I&#039;ve seen in a very long time. The story is as simple as it can get, with nine girls aiming to winning the School Idol competition known as Love Live. Though it&#039;s hard not to admit the faults of season one, the difference between the two seasons is interstellar. As I stated, the burning passion and struggles from films like Rocky or the Karate Kid is very evident here as we see, finally, what makes idols so special. Before seeing this series, I had always thought idols to be like generic pop singers only with a cutesy side to them. You can tell how obviously wrong I was. From what I&#039;ve seen, idols have a very distinct nature and goal, to shower emotion over the audience in their own unique spectacle. This is what I learned from Love Live and from no one else, as the girls of μ&#039;s struggle against themselves and each other. As the curtains come to a close and story of μ&#039;s nears its end, we&#039;re welcomed with one of the most powerful finales of all time. You&#039;ve felt this sensation before. When your little brother made that game winning goal? Or when you aced your exams? Or when you got your crush to like you? It is the spirit of achievement and reflection that make this anime truly an inspiring experience. <br />
<br />
Now, I have nothing against stereotypes. And when they&#039;re utilized correctly, they can do great things. In the first season of Love Live, we were introduced to, well, about nine archetypes that had adequate development to become a bit more three-dimensional. But the godly characterization of the series in only 26 episodes has turned our girls almost human. We&#039;re introduced to feelings and thoughts we never thought these characters could have, underneath their stereotypical exterior that truly defines their character as a whole. An example  is Rin who expresses a very self-defeating nature, the same we see in people who suffer insecurity, in her arc which, I have to say, does extremely well to develop her character and features one of my most favorite μ&#039;s songs of all time (LOVE WIIIING. LOVE WIIIING). Honoka also gets a share of this, exceeding the &#039;genkiest is the leader&#039; stereotype to a more definitive reason as to why she is the leader at all, allowing her characterization to truly define her as the one and only leader of μ&#039;s. But by far the best arc belongs to Nozomi, as, not only is her character expanded to degrees above and beyond, but it develops more the special relationship the girls have as μ&#039;s, the special feelings they share and why their separation would mean the end of it all. With all the characters given godly characterization, it&#039;s now not a story about Honoka, but about all of them.<br />
<br />
Now, I can&#039;t end this review without going technical. The music of Love Live is one of its main appeals, as a lot of the fans came from playing the musical game on their phones. The best thing about it is how distinct each track is in terms of delivery and emotion. The rhythm endowed that matches each story perfectly really emulates how in-tie music is with the series, unlike some others that like to just play random songs for the heck of it (K-On anyone?). The animation is also above average which is to be expected coming from Gundam-Printing company Sunrise. The design is stellar and gives these different girls a sort of unique flare that gives them distinction and makes them special. If it were not for the blonde hair, the ponytail and the baby blue eyes, Eli would not be my waifu today.<br />
<br />
If there were any way to describe this series, it would be inspiring. Being able to correlate both characters and story to the spirit of achievement, boiling with human desire and passion, in a way that is almost Grammy worthy makes this series truly amazing. Despite the somewhat flaky season one, season two is able to craft a story with meaning, emotion and passion. <br />
<br />
With top-notch characterization, a definitive success story and roaring emotion, I can proudly say that Love Live Season Two is one of the best of the best. <br />
<br />
(Written in honor of the Final Live and the end of the VAs&#039;s contract next year.  You will be dearly missed, μ&#039;s) <br />

    Ok,so I have done watching LL S2 and I have two words: truly amazing. In terms of school idol, if anyone want&#039;s a recommendation, I&#039;m totally recommend Love Live. Amazing,satisfying, the feels, and many more are there in LL.<br />
<br />
The anime continue from the first season which is after they save their school from closing. After they know that Love Live tournament will begin, they set their new goal which is to enter and win the tournament since they withdraw from previous LL. I would say, LL S2 really make an impact in terms of story. The balance between story and other character backstory is impaccable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200963">
        and that&#039;s one of the reason I really like about LL. They know how to focus each character backstory and combine it with main plot.<br />
<br />
For animation, I can see some improvement in their choreography, 3D CGI and background scenery/building. The synchronization between them in dancing makes the CGI looks nice and satisfying. For music and OST, awesome, nuff said. The songs including OP and ED keeps getting better including their performance in dancing. Goosebump? Yeah, LL S2 also gives you more goosebump and jaw dropping performance when they start their concert.<br />
<br />
Verdict: So, what can I say about Love Live School Idol Project S2 is the anime really did a good job showing me about school idol. Maybe not in reality or not as good as other school idol anime such as Idolmaster but LL totally makes me want to see them perform again altough they can&#039;t(you will know if you watch it). Also, prepare some tissues or pillow since ninja onion will come not once but twice(maybe thrice) when you watch it(again,you will know if you watch). From season 1 to season 2, from 3 members to 9 members, their jokes never cease to amuse me and their smile,laugh and sad moments always makes me happy and cry(man tears you know). Last but not least, thank you who create this, it was an amazing ride with tears and joy. Not many anime that makes me throb after finishing the series but LL already did that to me. For that, I give them 11/10. &quot;Muse - A story achieved together&quot;.

    Review contains some spoilers:<br />
<br />
Let me start out by saying that this will be a review of both seasons of Love Live: School Idol Project. There is almost no reason to separate the two seeing as Season 2 is a direct continuation.<br />
<br />
After being recommended this anime by a plethora of friends and already being a fan of slice of life shows such as K-On I decided to give Love Live a shot. It far exceeded my expectations in every way possible. While I enjoyed the most of the first season more than the second season, it still had a huge impact on me by the ending.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207886">
        So, without further ado lets break this down shall we?<br />
<br />
Story/Character:<br />
When it comes to Love Live you might immediately think to yourself that the music has to be the strongest point of this show. I mean, it&#039;s an Idol show right and nothing more? That&#039;s where you would be painfully wrong. The way this show ties together these 9 girls is flawlessly executed. All of them come from not so much a troubled past, but all have problems many of us faced throughout the course of High School. Their common goal brings them together putting them through numerous hardships and triumphs ultimately leading to their success in saving their school. On the other hand, they did not make it to Love Live the first time showing us the common principle that you can&#039;t win everything. On that note, the only thing I did not like about the show was how forced the second season felt. I could have guessed that they would be able to perform at Love Live, but I expected more of a time skip between the two competitions. All of that aside I still found myself engrossed in Season 2 by the heart wrenching end. The three 3rd year girls graduating and leaving the group hit me really hard. Leaving High School and abandoning all of your friends has to be one of the hardest things I have endured personally, and seeing these characters grow together and inevitably parting ways in the end was heart breaking.<br />
<br />
Music/Art:<br />
The music was of course fantastic seeing as we are watching a show about idols here. If poppy upbeat music isn&#039;t your thing however you might find yourself loathing most of the soundtrack and dance sequences. The art was very bright and vivid leaving me with no complaints in that department as well.<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
At the end of the day this anime has a lot of tropes that are probably going to spike negativity in some reviews , but for me the way that they tied these characters together was beautiful. I always found myself laughing, smiling, or even tearing up throughout the series and I can&#039;t wait to watch the movie for more fun to come!

    Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
Love Live season 2 has a great story following the first season. I only have two problems with the story. Firstly, getting into season two seems contrived as a second love live festival just happens to be held so Muse can participate. I don’t mind because we got a second season, but it still seemed forced. Secondly, I hated the Halloween episode as it was an excuse for fanservice and the insert song wasn’t very good.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
This shows best points are the characters. Each character is well fleshed out and well rounded. Every major character gets screen time and a chance to develop. None

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149419">
        of the characters fit into one troupe and I like that about them. The designs are also really nice and character interactions and developing friendships are nice to see.<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
<br />
I personally like the music in Love Live but feel that it’s an acquired taste as all the songs are the standard candy j-pop that idol groups tend to sing. Another reason for the rating is because not all the songs are memorable. Snow Halation was the big one for this season, but the rest of them, while enjoyable, don’t have a lasting impression.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
This would be a 10 had it not been for the 3D used during performances. The animation overall in Love Live is incredible and is very high quality. Animation breakdowns are near impossible to find in the series and character designs are very nice. Dance scenes are beautifully drawn but at some points 3D rendering is used and it honestly looks terrible. Although these moments are rare, they do bring the overall quality down.<br />
<br />
Overall Opinion: 9/10<br />
<br />
Season two did a magnificent job of holding onto the energy of season one and the slice of life genre while still have plot progression and a range of moments that make you laugh and cry. Overall, highly recommended.

    Finished the first season of the series, now Love Live! 2 continues the members of μ&#039;s journey to stardom.<br />
<br />
Story: Otonikizaka High School is saved thanks to the heroic efforts of μ&#039;s although they weren&#039;t able to win the first Love Live! competition because Honoka Kousaka, their leader, suffers a game-breaking injury because she got sick after performing &quot;No Brand Girls&quot;. However, the fight for the competition is not yet over because there is another Love Live! competition to participate and it is more challenging than ever. Now, the all nine members are reunited once again to sing their hearts out and win the competition. There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277496">
        is a big challenge however, the three third years are about to graduate and they must decide to continue performing without the third years or disband for good  and adding the pressure is the responsibilities as the new student council members of the founding three, Honoka Kousaka, Kotori Minami and Umi Sonoda. Can they handle all of these at the same time? Find out. (Okay, enough of a promo-esque act) The story has more drama, comedy and heartaches than ever because they are facing challenges and inner struggles.<br />
<br />
Characters - Nothing has changed since the first season but the are new characters that the μ&#039;s  will about to meet such as their rival idol group, A-Rise in person.<br />
<br />
Music and Sound - The series added more μ&#039;s songs such as my personal favorite, &quot;Snow Halation&quot;. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation - Sunrise is ableto  showcase the beauty of Akihabara especially during nighttime such as Gyoko Street, a location used for the music video of &quot;Snow Halation&quot;  which is very realistic and mirrors like the real life counterpart. The CGI animation of the series is so cool just like the previous season.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Just like the first season, the series is enjoyable to watch because of their determination to win the competition as well as their awesome music.

    Wow, Love Live!: School Idol Project Season 2. It is like the best anime in the entire planet to watch. I could of written a review for the ova and season 1 but i didn&#039;t find out about this feature on this website. So anyway, onto my review of this shall we? This season has been an emotional roller coaster since there was a lot of sad feels into this season, not as much as the first season but i gotta say that the relationship grew so much for the members of µ&#039;s ever since the first season. These two seasons of love live were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149407">
        fantastic and i&#039;m glad that i found the perfect anime for me to watch on my free time. I will always be a fan to this anime and the music group µ&#039;s. I hope in the future that there will be more songs from µ&#039;s. µ&#039;s became a part of my life since i watched the first episode of season 1. I got really attached to the characters and i can&#039;t imagine the rest of my life without them. µ&#039;s is my family now and i just can&#039;t handle the rest of my life without them. µ&#039;s worked really hard since season 1 and they finally reached their dream. I hope µ&#039;s stays together in the future so i can continue to support them through the rest of my life. Arigato the creators and voice actresses to working so hard to produce this great anime. µ&#039;s music~ start!

    Love Live School Idol Project is not meant for me. Reviewing a show this girly and happy is pretty much impossible based on my age, sex, and what I enjoy watching. The reason I don’t review Pretty Cure? I’m not a ten year old girl. The reason I review Love Live? Despite obviously being a show for ten year old girls it’s got a raging male fanbase that’s about my age.<br />
<br />
A year ago I wrote a review for the first season that I feel, now, complains about all the wrong things. It doesn’t at all hit the nail on the head for how to approach

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188426">
        this series. It also complains a lot about Nico. I don’t know why considering she’s my favorite girl in the series….<br />
<br />
Since that review the Love Live mobile game was released in May and, I won’t lie, I play it every once in a while when I need a time-waster. Also a second season was released early last year that I neglected till now because that seems to be the way I operate.<br />
<br />
The second season of Love Live has the girls of Muse participating in another Love Live tournament. As it will be the last chance for the seniors to win the tournament, there’s a lot of pressure on Honoka and the others to perform as well as possible. They’re forced to face off against their biggest rival, A-Rise and from there battle the best school idols in Japan.<br />
<br />
The start of this season beats around the bush so much I was nearly going to quit it. I didn’t remember the first season being quite so silly and pointless (but, that said, I barely remember much of anything about the first season in the first place). There’s a lot of exploration of the different characters as well as a really crappy storyline about writing a new song for the Love Live tournament. This episode, in which they go to one of Maki’s summer homes to get some peace, should have shown the comradeship of the girls and how they go about writing songs. What we get instead is a stupid, disjointed episode where, for some reason, they think it’s a good idea to write the lyrics and the music separately.<br />
<br />
What? So if the beat of the music doesn’t match the lyrics that’s okay?<br />
<br />
Two character episodes are actually somewhat interesting and fun. The Nico episode in which we get to see some of her family is pretty cute and the Rin episode where she’s trying to act like the girl she feels she is makes you d’aww.<br />
<br />
But after the slow start and the somewhat interesting character exploration, we’re presented with a lot of forced drama. The focus isn’t that much on the Love Live or the music; unlike the first season which I commended for having a lot of catchy  songs (I still remember Start;Dash a year later). But this season’s music is lacking any sort of staying power and it feels like it’s put on the backburner to make room for a ton of tears.<br />
<br />
The final few episodes are like…Ano Hana level of crying. It’s sad, definitely, to see the seniors go but it’s not so sad I need a whole episode dedicated to them bawling their eyes out. This is episode eleven, which is cute in execution and idea, but ends with so much forced crying that I wanted to laugh instead. It’s okay to be sad and express it but don’t be overexpressive. Especially on something as small as the seniors leaving.<br />
<br />
Then episode twelve is the concert of the Love Live. Be prepared for more cheesiness.<br />
<br />
And the last episode is the overlong epilogue that further drags out how sad it is the seniors are leaving then ends by…teaching us not to let go of people who are moving on? I didn’t understand the end at all.<br />
<br />
How come you guys can’t hang out after they go to college? Can’t you continue to be an idol group that focuses on larger stages? Doesn’t winning the Love Live mean you could do that sort of thing?<br />
<br />
Combine the over-dramatic and weak storytelling with the sheer girliness and you will be laughing your ass off. My God is this show cheesy with themes of friendship and love and following your dreams. The group stands together and screams things into the sky, people stand and clap for no reason, everyone acts like best friends. Oh, and don’t forget the cute little exultations that come every time that the girls see something mildly amusing. I like to call these “anime sounds” because in no other medium have I ever seen people go “uguu” over lights.<br />
<br />
The writing in the show is pretty lame as well. The character’s are all easily identifiable by their two dimensional traits but the things they say can really make you laugh. At one point Honoka is staring at the city with her friends and talking about how bright the lights are. There’s a huge Zen moment that makes no sense coming from a bunch of teenagers. They talk about the lights belonging to people and not knowing those people…like, what the fuck? And this is followed by them all screaming at the city, completely ruining the somber, thoughtful tone. For the most part, the show if funny if only because of the crappy script.<br />
<br />
Regardless of these complaints the show is cute as hell and still manages a laugh or two every episode that’s not courtesy of being shitty.<br />
<br />
The animation is alright. Just like the first season is resorts to MMD-style during musical numbers that makes everything look awkward. There’s a huge amount of close-up shots of the girls’ faces which can be scary as fuck (from afar you girls are moe but up close you’re freaking aliens). Otherwise it’s not impressive by any stretch.<br />
<br />
And the music, as I said, is weaker than season one. There’s a great variety of music during the show but the actual performances aren’t memorable at all.<br />
<br />
Oh, do you hear that sound? It’s time to play BEST GIRL!<br />
<br />
9. Honoka- I believe it was Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones who said the best way to keep an annoying bitch quiet is to put your genitals in her mouth. Honoka is the most annoying group leader of anything ever. Someone put their genitals in her mouth.<br />
8. Hanayo- Moeblob von No Character. I could give a fuck less.<br />
7.Umi- It’s so cute when you get mad. Too bad you’re boring otherwise!<br />
6. Kotori- Boooooooooring. But moe as hell.<br />
5.Eli- Cute but definitely not exciting.<br />
4.Rin- Good development in this season. The writers need to quit overusing the “Nyan” thing though because it’s really awkward.<br />
3.Nozomi- Really cute and probably the most mature of the characters. Also has a good gimmick.<br />
2.Maki- Tsundere rich lesbian is cool.<br />
1. Nico- May be a self-centered bitch at times but is only trying to live her dream and enjoy her passion. Totally the most adorable and best girl.<br />
<br />
Season 2 of Love Live might be good for younger girls or guys with nothing better to masturbate to, but for me, despite a few silly and cute moments, it was pretty forgettable.<br />

    Singing in front of people isn’t easy. Just picture yourself in front of an audience or in an arena of over 10,000 people looking at you and perhaps almost always judging you on your performance. It’s both a thrilling and nerve wrecking experience, especially for idols. But for Muse, this is exactly what they are aiming for – to perform and captivate the audience with their talent in the art of singing. Love Live School Idol Project returns for a second season starring Muse members are they find their way with music.<br />
<br />
μ&#039;s (pronounced as Muse), makes its anticipated return with all its members back. One

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182233">
        particular attribute that stands out for this group is the fact that Honoka, its group leader, has also became the school council president. The sequel insightfully shows how she is able to lead her group to stardom. It’s not easy given the intense competition such as popular idol group, Arise whom stands a firm obstacle in their way. Nonetheless, Honoka takes the stage and does her best to captivate the audience with her skills.<br />
<br />
While the first season introduced Muse’s members on the surface level, the second season goes beyond that and focuses more on some of its specific characters. In retrospect, more noticeable characters such as Nico, Rin, and Nozomi all get some of spotlight. Some even get parts of their past revealed in an honest way to show the audience their journey to whom they are now. The sequel does a solid job by evoking thoughts to appreciate the person they are today. And of course, that would be taking on the role of an idol as part of Muse. It takes a group of nine girls yet each of them deliver a special charm. In one particular episode, each of them describe their condition and purpose in just one yet solidifying word. These words are honest feelings with distinctive moments to focus on an aim to success. <br />
<br />
Even as an underrated group, Muse continues to make a dominant presence throughout the show. The paramount of their dream comes to a climatic moment when they perform their signature song in front of the audience. Also known for their spirit and determination, Muse is an inspiring group that seeks out their dreams, chases after it, and never ceases to let it go. Win, tie, or loss, the group wants to not just aim for success but also give the audience what they want. And that, is entertainment. The majority of the sequel is built-up but the final few episodes details the fruits of their efforts. In fact, the story is fairly simple. It’s about an idol group of girls aiming for success with their dreams. The catch is what happens afterwards? The sequel depicts a short yet memorable journey as their distinction could change these girls’ lives forever. It also makes us wonder what happens afterwards. As the show nears its end, the girls realizes that nothing lasts forever with tearful moments to induce hardcore feelings of sorrow.<br />
<br />
Responsibility and teamwork are also prominent ideas incorporated to this sequel. In fact, one particular member is made temporary leader on the spot as result of special circumstances. Luckily, this adapts with teamwork as she is able to hold everything together not just by herself but with her fellow idols. By presenting itself with this direction, it creates feelings of inspiration and can be relatable when you find yourself needing a helping hand. This is especially true earlier on in the series when the girls faces the hardship of writing music by pressure. And that’s what Muse really is, not just an idol group but a group of girls who shares a deep bond for music and their powerful friendship.<br />
<br />
Despite the premise and setup, the show does suffer a bit with some pacing issues. Some episodes feels fillerish including a trollish beach scenario. We also get some gimmicky storyline craftsmanship when it comes to execution with subplots like going on a diet habit. Also, it’s somewhat noticeable that some similar scenarios and scenes are reused; not entirely trace by trace but has familiarity. The recycled ideas becomes a bit of a pin-down and in essence doesn’t strongly recreate memorable moments. And despite being character focused, the series does omit highlights for some characters. The main point is that the sequel anticipates their performance in a festival against other prominent idol groups. The most developed rivalry is against the 3-girl group ARISE, who makes Muse look like an underdog. The rivalry is tense but ultimately isn’t anything too explicit or made into mainstream as a main event. Rather, it trifle on the event for Muse to become superstars with predictable outcomes.<br />
<br />
Artwork remains standard with Sunrise being charge of the production. Characters are designed with charm, innocence, and with the passion for music. Although not supermodels, the girls have their own qualities and portrays with a beautiful grace. The decorative outfits they wear in front of the world are not just flamboyant, attractive, but also become an image of their dream. Body gestures and their dance moves also inspire creativity with no movement being wasted. It’s hands down attractive not by appearance but with style, class, and inspiration.<br />
<br />
When talking about the soundtrack, the music would obviously be a key and in my respect, the sequel nails this right away. Although the OP song isn’t something home write about, music shown and performed in this show is colorful. Lyrics are detailed with energy and enthusiasm. Prominent songs from the original project makes their way with alternate edits to deliver a symbol of Love Live. The choreography is excellent with a down-to-earth style yet remains resilient with its smooth setting. Some of the songs also shows symbolism as the animators decorates it with background gags. Additionally, the characters all have distinctive voice mannerism to reflect their personalities. The bottom line is that they are able to command attention and deliver a stellar performance in connection with the songs.<br />
<br />
The show itself isn’t a masterpiece but it should be appreciable with this sequel. It’s not easy being an idol but with friends, anything is possible. The way Love Live can inspire is something to take notice of as the director and animators takes advantage of its directional story. Through characterization and focus, we see different sides of characters as they take on obstacles. And although the story isn’t complex or entirely thought provoking, it’s honest with great comedy. Just be aware that not all the songs can be something you’d enjoy, especially when compared to its original source. Yet, this sequel came, delivered, and leaves the building with endearing moments.<br />

    Yeah, it&#039;s a kind of late review but whatever and english isn&#039;t my Main language so im sorry if the vocabulary is not correct.<br />
<br />
First of all, The first season, The first season wasn&#039;t really that great It was Average/Mediocre for me.<br />
Mostly because at that time there were other school Idols anime which dominated the genre of School idol. But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the μ&#039;s and want to perform at Love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152289">
        live, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is&#039;t not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it.<br />
<br />
The first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way.<br />
Sunrise has made a big chance in every part.<br />
<br />
This season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode.<br />
<br />
The story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal.<br />
Now that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and μ&#039;s story<br />
<br />
Like any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED.<br />
The music got at it&#039;s peak when they released the ninth episode with &quot;Snow Halation&quot; This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it&#039;s just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment.<br />
<br />
The visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??).<br />
The CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn&#039;t really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched.<br />
<br />
Love live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks.<br />
Like i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn&#039;t, it&#039;s a huge improvement compared to the first season.<br />
<br />
Like any other anime It has come to it&#039;s end, the μ&#039;s are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the μ&#039;s!

    This review will go for both the first and second season, it seems kind of pointless to review them separately. Honestly I don&#039;t even know where to begin with this anime outside of the word spectacular. I realize I am slightly behind the curve but it must have slipped through the cracks for me when it aired. Regardless, this anime was absolutely incredible. <br />
<br />
Story - 9: My only gripe with the story is the ending of the first season. No spoilers but it was the weakest area of the anime and the only reason I cannot award it a perfect 10. As much as I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200818">
        would like to add it to my exclusive list of 10s, I just can&#039;t. Outside of this blemish in the middle of the series the story was phenomenal and went in the direction that just felt so right. The ending of the second season and thus the anime was perfect. With feels that hit in just right way and a big finish to end an anime that did things BIG, it was perfect.<br />
<br />
Art - 10: The art in the first season was awesome. Each character is drawn well in her own distinct way, the scenery is very nice and pleasing to the eye. The second season began and this became a whole new animal. The art was on par with best of any anime I have watched, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking, the detail in everything from surroundings to clothing to subtle facial features was beautifully done. The performances by Muse were also beautifully done, wile they cut to a 3D at times I deemed it necessary as well as pleasing to the eye. With all of these elements done so well art-wise, it was the art during the performances that put this anime over the top into the category of one of the best artistic shows I have watched.<br />
<br />
Sound - 10 (11): The music featured in this anime could possibly be the best I have experienced. If not the best, top 5 for sure. The score is masterfully written and used so well. It follows the scenes perfectly and sets the mood in a way that is matched by few. When the feels hit you, they hit hard thanks to a beautiful oboe piece. When the girls are being mischievous or having some fun, you can feel those feelings thanks to this magical score. The score however is just one element of the sound featured in this anime. As a school idol anime it features of course pop idol performances along with song. The songs sung by Muse and A-RISE alike are just great. This could depend on your taste in music, but for me as a J-Pop fan they were awesome. <br />
<br />
Character - 10: There are anime that run for literally years that do not develop characters as well as Love Live did. The show took nine girls and made me feel like each one could&#039;ve been the main character in her own way. They visibly grew as people, friends, a band, and even performers. You could see actual improvement in their shows from performance to performance, it was nothing short of brilliant. The members of muse even after the beautiful art ad captivating music had to be what I&#039;d say kept me wanting more. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10: I have not enjoyed an anime this much in a long time. Even when the writing seemed poor for a brief period I enjoyed the anime because of how much it made me care for the characters. Throughout I was on the edge of my seat, saying &quot;awwww&quot;, and maybe crying a liiiittle bit. It did everything well and I enjoyed it from episode 1-26.<br />
<br />
So as badly as I want to give this anime a 10 I have to give it a 9 because of the one hiccup season one. I have to keep the 10 rating for literally perfect anime or else the line blurs pretty hard. With that being said Love Live is an asymptote to a masterpiece. It is absolutely recommended at a 9/10. Thank you for reading!

    Ambition – the driving force of a goal.<br />
There’s no doubt that season 1 of Love Live is a truly weak series. There was a lack of detail to characterization; the flow of the plot was all over the place: Shoving cute girls and memes down your throat and then ending on some of the worst melodrama present in anime at the end. <br />
It would be easy to pass off the second season as equally irresponsible as the first; but oddly enough the second season of Love Live works wonders. This improvement in quality it ascends Love Live from being a trashy meme-fest into something of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263430">
        true emotion even if contrived at many points.<br />
<br />
Go for glory; the goal set in mind for the group.<br />
After saving their school and realising the little time they have left as a group with the third year students graduating; the nine girls of Muse up the ante by setting out to win Love Live!<br />
A simple plot really, but what makes this concept work so well is the structure of this season. Character based episodes and moments of bonding help flesh out the cast well enough while still building the story up to its climax. The fun notion and diverse story of each episode and improved comedy makes the ride endearing; episodes centred on the girls watching romantic films; Honoka and Hanayo losing weight and other quirky concepts that make the show constantly engaging; even if to poke fun at. These episodes are mostly comprised of interaction between the nine main characters; and whilst still conceivably stereotypical, they enhance the overall enjoyment of the show. Achieving a much better structure than what the first season achieved.<br />
<br />
This season also manages to be quite emotional with reminiscence of the journey the members of the group embarked on, the daunting realisation the girls feel as their final concert together as Muse draws near; all of it feels so content.  The dedication; the journey, everything the anime throws at you has you rooting for the girls in one way or another. By the end of the anime there’s enough development into each area of the show; that you may be able to look back in joy and appreciation at the story as a whole, and the bonds with each member of the group. Sure there are many times where elements of the show become questionable and writing feels weak; such as certain road-blocks for the group, seemingly dumb character actions, and a focus too heavily oriented on appealing as a Slice of Life oriented series; but that feeling of bitter-sweet progression for the group through this season make this a wonderful and whole-rounded experience. <br />
<br />
<br />
Of course the story wouldn’t receive this much praise if it was not for the development the characters received this season. In Season 1, many of the cast was under-developed with not much attention onto each characters ambitions and what holds the group together. In this season we’re shown brighter, memorable captivating versions of the group. With more attention to their ambitions; their relationships and bonds as the group “Muse.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Honoka receives some of the nicest development in this season compared to her personality in season 1; she’s still quite obnoxious, ditsy and dumb. But her role as the leader of Muse becomes more important this time round, with the new-found position of student council president she matures slightly and ditches all hesitation: Leading the members of Muse on their path to victory while still managing activities brought on by being president. She’s not a character worthy of much praise in the grand scheme of things, but her drive and aspirations to win Love Live not only for herself but for those around her who have helped her get this far is touching.<br />
<br />
Rin is the most noteworthy example of Love Live doing character development correctly. From an un-important side character from season 1; Rin evolves into a character that learns to stop doubting herself and breaks out of her shell. Improving confidence of her character and the rest of the cast is necessary to strengthen the bond between Muse; this leads to the group’s journey feeling more genuine, benefiting the show and Rin’s capability and likeability. Her development isn’t that special but the care into developing the cast members to create a more whole experience makes the show much more praise-worthy. <br />
<br />
Eli is my favourite character in this show; and probably my favourite anime girl in the entire medium. I don’t think she is a great character overall. But, her appearance, and caring; knowledgeable and sweet personality make her special to me. Her character had great development in season 1, but this season it focuses on a different section of her character; her relationship with Nozomi. <br />
<br />
In some-what of a yuri manner, the bond between these two characters is very close and they bounce of each other very well. Both clearly have a very strong relationship together; after spending a lot of time in the student-council. They are both a source of motivation for one another: as explored in Nozomi’s back-story of how they met and the affection they both share. It’s very sweet to see these characters interactions and tight bond with each other. They care for the group equally; especially Nozomi due to the loneliness she feels living on her own. Both are heavily endearing characters and are mature and beautiful.<br />
<br />
To be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Nico: A fan-favourite of the first season; Nico develops even further from her character arc in the first season. A display of her Narcissistic, self-centred attitude wishing to be praised by her family, after feeling desolation for two years from a lack of being able to find those with the same interests as her. This character arc leads to some quite charming and funny moments with the members of her family introduced, and Nico continues being as expressive as ever with her existential catchphrase &quot;Nico Nico Nii.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regarding the rest of the cast; most of their development took place in season 1, in which they maintain their personalities throughout the shows run. Kotori and Umi support Honoka in her aspirations and are quite pleasing characters, without any heavy development centred on them; same goes for the first years: Hanayo and Maki. While not serving super important roles into Love Live’s structure or development; they complement the series very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
As much as these characters do not contain much depth to them; this should not be a sign of them being bad. There’s probably gropes you can have with certain characters. But for the most part the cast serve the show well for what it is: A fun display of the idol dream coming to life with a quirky roster of school students.<br />
<br />
<br />
As animation goes for Love Live; it remains pretty generic and remains quite standard through its run-time, although this is an obvious improvement from season 1. It still doesn’t reach excel in style outside of the dance segments. While the face designs between characters aren’t very different from each-other; one area that works well for the show is the facial expressions: The over-exaggerated nature of these works extremely well with comedic impact. <br />
Love Live definitely doesn’t handle the switch between traditional and CG very well; something it has achieved later on in the franchise but at this point is still incredibly weak. While the dance scenes have pretty nice choreography and the scenes presented in the traditional animation style look wonderful the contrast between the two is quite jarring: The models being quite laggy and not blending in with surroundings very well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Much like the first season the song choices included aren’t exactly the best of what the music front of Love Live has to offer; the most memorable and emotional song of this season is “Snow Halation.” A song that has quite a bit of history on the internet; and one that is quite peaceful yet exciting to listen to at the same time. Another good inclusion is “Aishteruze Banzai” which is sadly cut short in run-time from its true potential impact as a song, leaving in un-memorable. For the other songs of the show, the opening and ending are similar to that of season 1: Complementing the genre well but not being too heavily impressive. Much is the case with many other songs in this season; the general preference in songs seems to be those catering to the generic ideal style of idol songs rather than more emotional and expressive songs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Love Live is a heavily captivating show; and it’s obvious how it got to the high point of success it did. Season 2 pumps out a lot of improvements to the characters, story and overall presentation making it a heavily enjoyable ride and something that will stick with me for a long-time. Watching the cast members grow is moving; the comedy is constantly hilarious. Therefore making Love Live Season 2 a show I wholeheartedly think is good even with its visible flaws.

Honestly, it&#039;s not easy to concisely describe just how vivid the second season of School Idol Project is. A beautiful outburst of the soul. A melodic magic that lifts the heart. A lyrical expression full of emotions. These words are close enough to express how I feel but really, it&#039;s better if you listen to µ&#039;s (&quot;Muse&quot;) once more. Because as the saying goes:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where words fail, music speaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every journey will always have a start and an end; and within it, there will always be a story. The story of µ&#039;s began as a school-saving solution,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294755">
        and through the passing of time, their journey is reshaped into a sincerity that speaks of passionate wonders, of incredible friendship, and of valued memories. The second season is a continuation of that. With the third-years&#039; graduation quickly drawing near, the end of µ&#039;s seems nigh, but it doesn&#039;t stop them from making sure their last experience is a meaningful one. The next destination is the second Love Live! contest, and they will make sure to give everything they can to reach that grand stage.<br />
<br />
This is the culmination of their experience together as a school idol group.<br />
<br />
Most of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we&#039;re given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn&#039;t get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member&#039;s influence on one another. Whether it&#039;s to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s this strong focus on µ&#039;s as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they&#039;re not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that—into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.<br />
<br />
Rivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of µ&#039;s to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it&#039;s proof that µ&#039;s has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.<br />
<br />
From the uplifting yet melancholic &quot;Snow Halation&quot; to the rosy &quot;Aishiteru Banzai!&quot;, Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I&#039;m sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it&#039;s the same adorable art that I&#039;ve grown to love, and I don&#039;t think that needs to change.<br />
<br />
When I reflect back on my journey with µ&#039;s and School Idol Project, I really couldn&#039;t have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I&#039;m their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give µ&#039;s a listen.<br />
<br />
Many music and memories are awaiting you.

    Not too long ago I looked at Love Live. The anime portion of a multi-media project. It was an enjoyable series. The first series introduced us to µ&#039;s (pronounced Muse.) µ&#039;s formed with three members in order to gain interest in their school to prevent it shutting down. We saw the original three gradually grow into nine. We saw the nine girls coming together as friends &amp; comrades, doing live shows and getting really, really, really homo-erotic with one another. So, our heroines managed to save their school in the end. Where are they going to go from there?<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with Honoka giving a speech

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198711">
        as the brand new student council President. Turns out Eri recommended her for the position. Hanayo is interrupted at practice by the news that they&#039;re doing another Love Live competition. Most members of µ&#039;s are excited by the prospect and eager to enter but Honoka is strangely uninterested, saying that things are fine as they are. The girls are able to persuade her that µ&#039;s should enter by pointing out that this will be Nozomi, Eri &amp; Nico&#039;s last chance to compete in the competition since they&#039;re graduating shortly after. They&#039;re also able to ascertain why Honoka hesitated. The story follows µ&#039;s and their endeavour to win the competition, their coming to terms with the third years graduating and them just having fun and being yurirrific.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the narrative in this series is that the main arc surrounding the competition is really predictable. You can pretty easily guess where it&#039;s going to go just from the set up, without watching a single episode of the series. The series does do a lot well, though. The comedy in this is really effective. The first series was pretty entertaining and had some good comedic moments, but this one elevates it to a completely different level. There are also some really good moments in the main narrative, in spite of its general predictability and there is some effective tension surrounding the graduation and the question of where µ&#039;s is going to go from there. The ending is a bit bitter-sweet but it&#039;s really effective.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The girls get to develop further as characters than they did in the first series. There are several episodes primarily dedicated to developing them as characters and adding depth to the archetypes. Rin and Nozomi both get really good ones. I will also give this series credit over the first, Nozomi&#039;s bad touch habit is virtually non-existent in this one. She gropes another girl without permission once. Which is still completely not okay, but at least it&#039;s not a regular thing like it was in the first series. I bet Eri threatened to break up with her if she kept groping other girls. Either way, the combination of that getting toned significantly down and her focus episode combine to transform Nozomi into a really good character. The characters are still a lot of fun and there are still really good interactions, including some with the rival idol group, A-Rise.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Much like the first series, this one has really good costumes and dance numbers. The characters are still basically missing their noses, though. I think this art style was designed by someone with rhinophobia. That would explain so much. In spite of that, the art and animation are good.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The cast is excellent. Love Live has singers who are also excellent in their roles. See, Ice, it is possible to have people who can do both. The music is superb. Both series of Love Live have really mazing soundtracks.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s easy to see why yuri fans gravitate towards this franchise. The les-yay levels are massive. Really, any potential pairing would make sense but there are some that come across more strongly than others. Rin and Hanyo continue to be really adorable. We&#039;ve also got Nozomi and Eri, who also get quite a bit of les-yay with both Maki and Nico. Honoka, Umi and Kotori are all really homo-erotic with one another.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Love Live series 2 is a definite improvement over the first. The characters are strengthened. The comedy is more effective and the story, overall, has more going for it. It&#039;s not perfect, but it&#039;s well worth watching. My final rating on it is going to be a 9/10. The first series was good. This one is excellent. Next week I&#039;ll look at Solty Rei.
