    So I go and I discover this little girls&#039; anime, having never watched a series of Precure in my life, and I come out, after about 3 months of watching the series front to back, and I&#039;ve truly become a man.<br />

        well. While the series uses a pretty distinct formula: the main group of girls have a minor conflict, and we&#039;re introduced to a character of the week that is having a similar conflict, that drives them to despair. One of the generals catch them in sorrow and steal their sou- ...um heart flower and turn them into a Deserterian, the girls transform and fight the monster, the general mocks the character of the week for their stress , one of the girls, usually Tsubomi argues for the good nature of the character of the week, the purify the COTW and the COTW&#039;s conflict is resolved, we learn about some &quot;Flower Language 101&quot; (which isn&#039;t just made up by the creators, Google it) and its case closed. Even though the formula is, for the most part, rigid, it rarely gets tedious and they even throw some new tricks into the bag such as the general piloting the Desertarian like its a mecha. Even though they&#039;re only one episode long, two tops, they stand on their own nicely.<br />
But its not just episodic narratives all the way through, about 10-15 episodes is dedicated to advancing the story, whether it be introducing new cures, or the excellent last 6 episodes, which pretty much sealed the perfect 10 that I gave the story. The ending probably ranks along with Code Geass and Madoka Magica among the best endings in my book.<br />
<br />
ART: 8<br />
They do cut a lot of corners sometimes with the animation, using a bunch of CG for stuff like the activation items, and occasionally sloppy animation. Also the reuse of animation for things like transformations and finishing moves may turn some people down. However, at several points they show how good the animation team is, especially during the final 6 episodes. <br />
The designs are a whole different ballgame, they are very versatile and can work in many situations. Not to mention they are heart-attack-inducing adorable! Also, the Gold Forte Burst animation is jaw-dropping to say the least.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9<br />
The soundtrack is very excellent. The series got dark and it got tragic sometimes. The art and the soundtrack really are the two things that made these moments so great. One thing I have yet to mention is how the series uses parallelism to great effect in this series. At one point the song &quot;Heart Goes On&quot;, initially used during the fashion show that was built up to for several episodes, is used during the climax of the series. The soundtrack helped the series make me cheer, laugh, and nearly cry. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 10<br />
I&#039;ll not spend a century focusing on ALL the characters, but they all are solidly built. Tsubomi develops throughout the series from a coward to a bright and loving hero. Yuri Tsukigage is a minor character for nearly half the series, but nearly steals the spotlight from Tsubomi near the end, not to spoil a whole lot. The rest of the cures are excellently built and a great ensemble. The characters of the week are of special mention as nearly all of them get a detailed backstory, except for the last one, who just gets his sou-...heart flower snatched right after he remarks how he doesn&#039;t have a girlfriend, and he is never seen again. They serve as a Chekhov&#039;s Gun near the end as they help the cures not lose hope when the bad guy is nearly about to win.<br />
Speaking of bad guys, I guess I have to mention them.<br />
The generals are excellent characters, you sympathize with them, but ultimately root for the cures to triumph. They are quirky but not to be trifled with. Excellent.<br />
Sabbaku is defininely worth mentioning as a great character. His best traits are best left undiscussed due to MAJOR spoilers. But near the end reminds you of a certain other masked villain that you&#039;ll probably recognize unless you live under a rock. <br />
Dark Cure while kinda vague, definitely acts as a solid adversary, espescially for the final cure.<br />
The big boss, Dune, is a fabulous villain in more ways than one. He nearly accomplishes his goal, which makes him probably the most capable villain I know of, and takes all the strength the cures can muster to defeat. GG Dune.<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT<br />
<br />
I was hesitant to give this anime a perfect 10, but this anime is one of the best series I have watched. And to think its a kids&#039; show. <br />
<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
RECOMMENDATION: VERY HIGH<br />
<br />
Now the heart tree will get better!<br />
<br />
Your move My Little Pony!

    Heart­catch has one massive point in its favour over every single other Pre­cure: It can do drama. It’s not stu­pid. I can’t stress enough how import­ant this is. In Heart­catch, the evil mon­sters that fight the Pre­cure are cre­ated using the waver­ing hearts of humans. What that means is every epis­ode has someone wor­ried about some­thing hap­pen­ing in their life, and the epis­ode tends to revolve around how they get over that prob­lem. Usu­ally the issue is just that they don’t have enough con­fid­ence in them­selves. A girl is afraid of talk­ing to the Stu­dent Coun­cil Pres­id­ent she admires so much because she gets all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38433">
        nervous when she’s around her. A boy is afraid his mum won’t approve of his ambi­tion to become a manga author. Very simple little stor­ies, but each one is handled with care and enough heart, without the solu­tion ever being some­thing pathetic and pulled out of nowhere. Sure, the solu­tion is gen­er­ally “you’re not weak at all!”, but the solu­tion to each prob­lem is gen­er­ally the per­son just needs more con­fid­ence in them­selves. At its centre, that is what Heart­catch is about. Have con­fid­ence in your own men­tal strength and you can achieve anything.<br />
<br />
Another point in Heartcatch’s favour is the anim­a­tion style. It’s done by the same team who did Cas­sh­ern Sins, which is a bit of an odd mix. Cas­sh­ern Sins is a great show, but it’s hella depress­ing post-apocalyptic mater­ial, and to have them do a Pre­cure seems like a match made in “didn’t think this through prop­erly” land. But it works, cer­tainly in the anim­a­tion style depart­ment. Heart­catch is styl­ish. The designs seem to be made with move­ment in mind, rather than other Pre­cures where the char­ac­ters don’t move freely at all and every fight scene is simply them pan­ning across the screen (*cough* Fresh Pre­cure *cough*). The anim­at­ors are rather happy to let their char­ac­ters go deformed for the sake of more fluid anim­a­tion, but the artstyle suits the free-flowing designs quite well. Heartcatch’s fight scenes are far and away the best out of the Pre­cure fran­chise, albeit that’s not par­tic­u­larly high praise. In com­par­ison to other action anime, it doesn’t com­pare to Bones or Gainax level mater­ial, but it sure is pretty to look at.<br />
<br />
The trans­form­a­tion sequences are…well, actu­ally they’re not all that bitch­ing at all. At least, the main two aren’t. They decided a cell phone was too unori­ginal for this ver­sion of Pre­cure, so instead decided to use per­fume as a Pre­cure trans­form­a­tion aid. Full points for ori­gin­al­ity I guess, but this does mean what you get is a spray-on Pre­cure cos­tume, which is rather under­whelm­ing. It’s only until the third Pre­cure shows up that we get a proper bitchin’ trans­form­a­tion sequence<br />
<br />
Not that Heart­catch solved all the prob­lems of the pre­vi­ous Pre­cures. The magical pets are still as annoy­ing as fuck. The BUY OUR TOYS still isn’t that well integ­rated into the plot. No really Pre­cure, I’m cool with your amaz­ing gos­pel 2nd end­ing song hav­ing awe­some CGI dan­cing in it, but it’s jar­ring when every instance of BUY OUR TOYS is accom­pan­ied with the product in ques­tion being in CGI itself. It makes it stand out all the more jar­ringly, espe­cially when they have to go through gimicky actions that the toys can also do. Like, come on. What sort of magical girl has to wind up their wand before they can use it? But the fact that it had a brain and wasn’t pain­fully stu­pid with its epis­odic plot­lines far out­weigh the prob­lems I had with BUY OUR TOYS and annoy­ing magical pets.<br />
<br />
And yet…<br />
<br />
And yet…<br />
<br />
Pre­cure is a car­toon aimed at little girls. Kids like repe­ti­tion, or so I’ve been told. I did too, when I was, like, 4. Heartcatch’s non-plot related epis­odes fol­low such a strict for­mula that they start to get bor­ing after a while. It’s the same prob­lem I had with Hell Girl, and even that tried to mix things up a little more than Heart­catch ever tried to. Every epis­ode fol­lows the exact same damn pat­tern, to the point that they start to blend together. This is Not Good for an epis­odic show. Each epis­ode should have some­thing that makes it stand out from the rest. That was the one where they all talked back­wards for the epis­ode. That was the one where the col­ours all inver­ted. I dunno, I’m not a scriptwriter, but there’s noth­ing remark­able about most of the epis­odes. They don’t try to make them stand out, except on very rare occa­sions. Even the ones where plot-related stuff hap­pen, the show still goes through the exact same motions. It doesn’t mat­ter how great your for­mula is, it will be less inter­est­ing with every repeat of the for­mula if you don’t mix it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Then there was the plot. Yeah. The plot. For gods sake, why do even the appar­ently good Pre­cure vil­lains fall foul of the pathet­ic­ally dumb Pre­cure vil­lain syn­drome? Dark Pre­cure is Cool. She has a single black wing and is amaz­ingly over­powered com­pared to our her­oes. Then why does she not attack them? There is a scene where she is about to deliver the fin­ish­ing blow, but then retreats because Mys­ter­i­ous Voice From The Sky calls her away. There was no reason for her to be called away either, she just went any­way. And it’s not like the vil­lains don’t real­ise what a threat the Pre­cures are to them. I don’t neces­sar­ily mind that the under­lings are stu­pid, spend­ing their time admir­ing them­selves in the mir­ror. They’re meant to be stu­pid, and the show embraces that. But why are Sabaku and Dark Pre­cure not attack­ing the Pre­cures when they real­ise what a threat they are? What the fuck do they spend their time doing in the dark castle? She had no prob­lem defeat­ing Cure Moon­light back in the day, why not these two Pre­cures before they get stronger? Oh wait yeah, I know. Pre­cure Vil­lain Syn­drome. Give them a stick and a banana just out of their reach, they’ll pro­ceed to choke on the stick.<br />
<br />
But even the plot with the good guys is stu­pid. Every single rev­el­a­tion to the plot was lame. The rev­el­a­tion who the fancy man who kept sav­ing them was an incred­ible anti-climax. The reveal of who the third Pre­cure would be was a let down. Every time a plot related incid­ent would occur in the epis­ode, it would never res­ult in some­thing I par­tic­u­larly cared about. The plot related epis­odes were never par­tic­u­larly good, apart from maybe intro­du­cing a new bitchin’ trans­form­a­tion sequence or new move. The best epis­ode of the series was the Mother’s Day one by an abso­lute mile, and that had noth­ing to do with the plot.  It was just a well-directed epis­ode that told a power­ful mes­sage. But non-plot related epis­odes, as I explained earlier, got repet­it­ive and dull. I found myself watch­ing the next epis­ode pre­views to see if any­thing poten­tially dif­fer­ent would hap­pen. But this too was a mis­nomer, as new events never suc­ceeded in improv­ing the qual­ity of the epis­odes. Next epis­ode has a new Pre­cure, hope­fully that will improve the qual­ity, right? Nope, still the same old stuff it has been pump­ing out since epis­ode 1, except now there’s an extra part to the trans­form­a­tion sequence.<br />
<br />
I reached the epis­ode where we got the fourth Pre­cure. But her becom­ing a Pre­cure was tele­graphed to us for the past sev­eral epis­odes, so there was no joy in see­ing it be real­ised. How she came about gain­ing the power to become a Pre­cure was done via sev­eral ran­domly intro­duced plot ele­ments over the past few epis­odes, such as a magical fly­ing castle and the fact the Heart Tree can appar­ently travel across time and space, and that magical pets come from heart seeds, and all sorts of totally ran­domly intro­duced plot points for the sake of advan­cing the plot. But it’s not like the show ever changed. The vil­lains were still being stu­pid. The Pre­cures were still going through the same routine. The end of the epis­ode showed the fourth Pre­cure doing her bitchin’ trans­form­a­tion sequence and get­ting ready to fight Dark Pre­cure. I thought to myself “well that was bor­ing, but I gotta see the next epis­ode because she fights Dark Pre­cure in it”<br />
<br />
…and stopped myself. I had fallen into that trap. I’m not watch­ing the anime to see what’s hap­pen­ing. I’m watch­ing the anime to see what’s going to hap­pen. Noth­ing that’s ever hap­pen­ing in the present ever enter­tains me. Only the prom­ise of changes in the future keep me going. Even if there is some­thing worth watch­ing, it comes out of non-foreseeable, non-plot related events like the Moth­ers Day epis­ode. And there was where I dropped it. Epis­ode 33. At the very point of the grand reveal, I gave up.

    After Hugtto Precure convinced me hard to give a chance to the rest of the franchise, I went for the entry that seems to be the most loved and popular (except maybe the original) of the franchise, did it live up to the hype? Well, it sure did in my opinion!<br />
<br />
Tsubomi, the protagonist of this story, is a shy girl who definitely didn&#039;t fit with what the image of what the standard Precure protagonist looked to me, I think that this is played very nicely through the story and seeing her open up more while keeping what makes her be her was so satisfying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288797">
        see. Together with the cheerful and absurdly lovable Erika by her side, they form the main duo of the story for a good time before the other Precure join.<br />
<br />
Those episodes with them alone were &quot;the weakest&quot; part of the series to me (saying that in quotes because they were still enjoyable) and were focused on giving the spotlight to side characters (mostly classmates or the family of the MCs) and our girls helping them both via interactions, and by kicking ass defeating the &quot;Desertrians&quot;, monsters created by the enemies of this story combining an object and the wiltered hearts of the characters. This anime uses the fact that Tsubomi loves flowers very strongly using that detail, with the flower each character has having a meaning that fits with their problem.<br />
<br />
Once the other and equally nice Precure join the group, the plot starts to really pick up and only gets better and better, with very emotional moments and solid development for the characters. I don&#039;t want to possibly overhype it, but honestly the final episodes were some of the most epic I have watched.<br />
<br />
With a nice main cast is also needed a nice villain side, and The Desert Apostles did a successful job on that. Precure does a very good job at being lighthearted while also not shying away when it has to be darker, and the villains were a good example of that in execution, I enjoyed the interactions and comedy moments between them and/or with the Precures a lot and they ended up being very memorable as well when it came to the more serious parts involving their characters.<br />
<br />
The art style of the series is so visually appealing and allows for a wide array of nice reactions and goofy movements from the characters while looking perfectly fitting with the show, and the great designs by Yoshihiko Umakoshi (Casshern Sins, Boku no Hero Academia, Doremi, Mushishi...) definitely were a part of that, the action scenes are also solid, abundant and well animated, not to mention the nice transformation scenes of the characters. The soundtrack of the series is also nice and has some very memorable tracks.<br />
<br />
After only saying more and more positives I guess that it&#039;s time to say the problems I had with the series, which honestly didn&#039;t affect my opinion in the long run:<br />
<br />
- The first is the already mentioned slower start, while I always enjoyed watching the episodes, I didn&#039;t feel that it hooked me in nowhere as much as Hugtto or Princess Precure (which I watched right after) did, so I wasn&#039;t feeling as hyped and also a bit worried that maybe I wouldn&#039;t end up loving it as much as I wanted to, but yeah, that got fixed later on, boy it did.<br />
<br />
- The second is the mascot characters of the main duo, that honestly were pretty annoying at first and I was never a fan of the &quot;a heart seed is coming out!&quot; scene after they defeat the Desertrians they face (and thank god the animation of that part got more polished, they are clearly pooping it, c&#039;mon!)  But they grew on me as the episodes passed and even took the spotlight in a comedy focused episode that made me laugh really hard and I loved.<br />
<br />
- Lastly, this just seems to be a thing with the franchise as a whole. As a series that lives by selling the toys they make based on the anime they know that they have to advertise them, and how they do so? By making the objects the girls use look exactly like they would as a toy and even use CGI for some, this makes total sense but at times I couldn&#039;t help but feel like &quot;man, they are really trying to sell the product here&quot;, which let&#039;s be honest, it&#039;s pretty stupid thinking about it: of course they are not making anime because why not, we wouldn&#039;t get more if it didn&#039;t sell! It&#039;s a matter of getting used to it, and why lie, I freaking want a Flower Tact! I&#039;m not surprised at all that this is the best selling entry so far.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t watched any Precure yet and you&#039;re reading my review you might feel put off by the last two negative points and think that this is in anime that only kids might find enjoyable, but I can promise you that this isn&#039;t the case and that anyone has a chance to really enjoy it, the characters are very compelling and likeable, the comedy is solid, the action is nice looking and the story is interesting and has some darker moments that definitely surprised me seeing. This franchise is so painfully underwatched in the west and I hope that this slowly changes as time passes. Nice anime I can&#039;t recommend enough and a totally good point to start with the franchise.

    Story: Story has never been a strong point for any tokusatsu/magical-girl anime. This is proven again as we&#039;re treated to a fun, albeit predictable story. If you&#039;ve seen Sailor Moon  or Power Rangers growing up (and let&#039;s face it, who hasn&#039;t?) you know the monster-of-the-week formula by heart. Having said that there is enjoyment to be found in it&#039;s light hearted fluffy plot, assuming you don&#039;t take it too seriously.<br />
<br />
Art: Definitely a strong point for Heartcatch. The animation is very smooth and colourful, making the series a treat for the eyes. Bright colours, explosions, Dragonball level beam-spam and fun to watch battles make up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25977">
        for most of the series shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Sound: While some character&#039;s voices can become irksome at times (Shypre Coffret come to mind) the voice casting is generally well done. Nana Mizuki does a great job capturing Tsubomi&#039;s timidness and strength as a Precure, and Fumie Mizusawa is always a delight to hear as the spastic Erika. The rest of the sound is somewhat generic for an magical-girl anime, but still crisp and fun to hear every time they use their special attacks. The music is also extremely well done, easily meeting cinema level quality and composition.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Ah yes, here&#039;s where it&#039;s up for you to decide. I myself enjoy the cheesy plot and epic fights that tokusatsu/magical-girl series are famed for. But again, your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Overall: While Heartcatch Precure may not be the anime of the year, it&#039;s certainly worth a glance if not to reminisce upon those days of yonder spent planted in front of the television watching Saturday morning cartoons. Highly enjoyable, assuming you&#039;re not looking too deep into it.

    How many times have you heard the saying that ‘The flower who blooms slowly is the best of them all’? Yeah, you are probably thinking that you might have heard it in some other ways, but, anyways, as old and boring as that saying sounds, Heartcatch is proof of that. And it takes it to another new level.<br />
Flowers, like everything else, have a reason for being given, gifted. Heartcatch is here to explain that, and the main character’s heart seeds beautifully bloom. One thing that I will always like about Heartcatch is its creativity and experimenting with different flowers. At each episode’s end, they will

          <span style="display: none;" id="review153281">
        say what somebody’s heart seed says about their personality. Now that’s something to watch, with that many different things. But nevertheless, the characters and their own development are a spectrum of flowers of their own. And each has their thorn.<br />
Story: 8 out of 10<br />
The story is like every other Pretty Cure series’. But with a twist. Each person possesses a heart seed inside their heart. They are all connected to the Heart Tree, which watches over them. But, of course, The Desert Apostles are here to destroy that tree and to desert the entire world. Cure Moonlight, a powerful pretty cure, ends up defeated, and two tree fairies/mascots, deliver the Heart Perfume, the Transformation Item, to a girl, Tsubomi Hanasaki, who is supposed to be the new Cure and defeat the enemy.<br />
The story is cheesy, but what the creators do with it, takes the Pretty Cure franchise to a whole new level. The pacing is pretty good, not forcing things and giving each character room to develop and understand/agonize over things the right amount of time. It has some filler since it’s Pretty Cure, but each are enjoyable and not something to be bored of. Although, Heartcatch has a more focused storyline than different seasons, so there is not that much filler in it. The comedy is also good, without moments just being randomly thrown in. <br />
<br />
Art: 8 out of 10<br />
The art is amazing. Extremely luscious, pastel colors are used. The characters are drawn differently from the other series, but that just makes it interesting. Their moods are portrayed very well in their face expressions and movements. They also have hair colors, clothes, according to the side they are on. If they are good, they have bright colors. If they are evil, they have dark colors. The art depends on the atmosphere, if it’s a happy scene it’s pretty vivid and bright, if it’s a dark scene it’s pretty dark. It’s very creative and it was a pretty good direction for this season. <br />
Buildings, sceneries, towns are drawn very well and you can point out the details. As I said and will probably keep on saying, it’s very creative. Some things are pretty quirky and fun and they give you a pretty good feeling. It’s extremely vivid also. <br />
The special effects and CG are also good. They seem much vivid than in other seasons and they just blend in with the show and its creativity naturally. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7 out of 10<br />
The sound is good, but that’s it. The opening theme is pretty catchy and so is the first ending theme. Characters dancing, ‘bringing it to life’ in the ending themes help out. The second ending theme is more slow and has a softer tune. It is enjoyable, regardless. The OST is cool too, with happy themes and not so happy themes. Still, as I said, it’s not the most memorable thing, but enjoyable.<br />
Voice acting is perfect. Nana Mizuki does a great job in voicing Tsubomi and making her introverted yet quirky personality come to life. Fumie Mizusawa also does a great job in showing Erika’s lively character. Overall, the voice acting is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Character: 8 out of 10<br />
What Heartcatch does with it’s characters it’s amazing. Honestly, that’s it.<br />
Tsubomi, unlike many other mahou shoujo heroines, who are clumsy, ditzy, cheerful and extroverted is weak-willed, shy, studious and introverted. That’s one of the many things that sets this show apart from Pretty Cure and probably some other magical girl shows. Tsubomi does not actually want to be a Pretty Cure. Remember the Fresh season? Love accepted her powers so fast and without any questions, but Tsubomi is the complete opposite of that. You will only hear her screaming for help and complaining in the first episodes. And she’s right . It’s not easy putting your life out on the line and getting introduced to such unreal things. What the show does with her is amazing. She says she wants to change and she does. It’s not a one episode change where it all happens and she becomes confident and stuff. It happens slowly. In the end, she not the same she was at the beginning, but she’s not also fully changed either. That is something that I find very true, that people can’t really change completely and that it takes time. <br />
Contrasting Tsubomi and her shyness is Erika, who ironically is supposed to be the ‘blue’, water-themed character, but she is the total opposite of that. Erika is lively, confident, talkative and fun. She may come off as nosy at first but she is a great friend to Tsubomi and her other friends. And she does not change. A bit. But that’s what I love about her.<br />
Other characters include Itsuki, the yellow cure, who is a very courageous and quirky character. Her development with some things going on with her is pretty good and in the end, you see that she has changed a lot since the beginning. Yuri, Cure Moonlight is a fallen cure, who slowly regains her pride and comes to terms with what she’s done. She seems like a strict individual, but has a good heart. Her development is nice too.<br />
The villains are fine. There’s Sasorina who is a selfish and proud woman, who always wants to be the best. Kumojacky, a hot-blooded man who lives for fighting, but is respectable and wants a good opponent to fight. There’s also Cobraja, a narcissistic blue-haired man who has a great love for beauty. There’s also Dark Pretty Cure, who as the name implies is a Dark Pretty Cure, badass and surrounded by mystery. Things will get intense if she appears.<br />
Overall, Heartcatch is a good magical girl series. If you want to watch a fun magic girls show, then Heartcatch is for you. It’s okay if you don’t even want to watch the whole Pretty Cure franchise, just watch Heartcatch. It’s on a whole new level. But you can always drop it, you know. Anyways, Heartcatch is the most critical acclaimed Pretty Cure season for a pretty good reason. <br />

    Heartcatch Precure is absolutely gorgeous to look at and Yoshihiko Umakoshi’s character designs are absolutely stunning, the fight scenes in this series are well-choreographed. If you’re looking for a series that is rich in pretty sakuga then Heartcatch is definitely that, oh!, and if you like this then Katanagatari would definitely be up your alley!<br />
<br />
	• To me, Heartcatch is far more of a story-driven plot than character. I didn’t feel much of an affinity for any of the characters. I felt like a had a girlfriend, who looked very pretty, but I didn’t like hanging out with her for too long. Yeah, that’s an apt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288297">
        comparison. <br />
	<br />
	• As the Precure series have evolved, Japan seems increasingly aware that their target is no longer children, but mostly otaku… because, well, the Japanese aren’t reproducing. So, over the years, the lesbian innuendoes in Precure are heavy and the girls are more moe than ever. <br />
	<br />
	• I liked how the plot wrapped around, and the landscapes as well as the characters and choreography were stunning. The twist at the end was fairly obvious to someone who is not a child, but it was a fun adventure.<br />
	<br />
	• Some parts of the series felt like tiresome filler to me, which made Go! Princess Precure a slightly better series overall. Minor character growth happens but not in spades, growth especially with Tsubomi breaking out of her timid, meek, nerd shell (ironic, since the name Tsubomi literally means blossom), but some characters really didn’t change much, like Erica and Itsuki.  <br />
	<br />
	• The change in Yuri’s cool and collected act seemed pretty subtle as well. I think the series was a rather enjoyable experience on the eyes. If you’re looking for an intellectual, deep plot then no, you wouldn’t like this series, but if you just want basic fun and pretty girls then… yeah, totally! It’s like a field of flowers… that happens to be full of floral symbology!<br />
	<br />
	• Overall, I initially was going to rate Heartcatch Precure a 7/10, because the filler segments seemed uninspired and empty at times, but the way that the ending tied the loose ends together deserved a 8/10 in my eyes!

    Honestly, I was pretty underwhelmed. Based on how hyped this season is, I was at least expecting a more solid finale. Like reviving the past Cures (or at least showing them for more than 3 seconds at a time) among other things, which I&#039;ll add in a series rating below this message. But honestly, this finale was pretty bad. I was really expecting more from this type of series. 2/5 for the final episode, unfortunately.<br />
With the entirety of Heartcatch Precure, I honestly need to say I went into it looking forward, and...I was pretty disappointed. Not because Erika and Itsuki&#039;s arcs are written weirdly, it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412895">
        the entire thing. This season has a lot of pretty good twists and plot developments, but they fail to follow through on anything. Tsubomi for instance, one of the best characters, promises to change &quot;bit by bit,&quot; although, from an objective point of view...she&#039;s still the exact same person she was all those episodes ago. I understand that in order to keep the characters identifiable but this shouldn&#039;t be exaggerated to the point of obstructing character development. Tsubomi was even wearing her glasses in the final episode, which I believe symbolized her &quot;shy&quot; nature that she&#039;d outgrown earlier in the series (written in tandem with her character wearing them less and less, until they stopped appearing almost completely.) For her to wear them in the finale, after the battle, is an indicator that her character hasn&#039;t changed; she&#039;s still the same introverted, shy person she was at the beginning, self-actualization or not. As for other character arcs, all I have to say is that they were extremely uneven in their pacing, and their development. If we take, say, Sasorina&#039;s character arc, let&#039;s look at it a little bit. I made a comment earlier that her character arc began in episode 25, and was put on the backburner and stagnated until episode 40. This is not an exaggeration; she still appeared to fight the Precure in typical episodes as if nothing unusual had happened (besides changes that were too subtle to even consider that she was acting differently.) Kumojacky and Cobraja&#039;s redemption arcs on the other hand, felt rushed; they were crammed into the span of two episodes, the latter of which being the second to final time they appeared (having been reborn like Sasorina in episode 49)<br />
I would say the characters who I was most disappointed to see were Dune and Sabaku, for a multitude of reasons. As I mentioned with Dune many times, Dune is power scaled far beyond the average villain; he was able to practically annihilate the Precure &quot;without&quot; his powers in his official debut appearance, and died to a single punch from Blossom in the finale. Sabaku is unfortunate as his character itself leaves more questions than answers. Here are just a few off the top of my head: Why did he feel the need to create Dark Precure? Why was he so intent on hurting his daughter? Was he sadistic, or was this an attempt to test her strength? Did Dune manipulate him? On the last question, this is made more difficult to answer as Sabaku went to Dune of his own free will. His entire character arc needs more explanation, not to mention the complete lack of handling of any level of grief or resentment Moonlight held toward her father. Based on the amount of grief she felt based solely on Cologne dying, I find it near impossible to believe she would have no ill will towards her father whatsoever, and the series&#039; failure to address this simply complicates the issue, since it isn&#039;t even mentioned afterwards. Dark Precure also needed more explanation; all we received was a vague explanation that Sabaku created him, but the answer left out the perhaps more valuable reason of why she was created in the first place. Why was she suddenly able to understand Sabaku&#039;s love for her at the end, if she was programmed to not feel compassion or emotions? Did Dune convince him to create her? Did he create her before he turned evil? Overall, this series leaves more questions than answers, which isn&#039;t something any fan wants to hear. I would also mention that this series is not as &quot;dark&quot; as, even previous seasons. Fresh Precure, Splash Star, even Yes 5 all had moments much darker than anything here, and while that doesn&#039;t make it inherently bad, a series<br />
needs to have a reason to be dark without appearing as though it&#039;s only for shock value. Compare say, themes of communism present in Fresh, the Kiryuu sisters dying in Splash Star, even Desperiah, a pure out-and-out villain at face value, sealing herself within the Earth to save everyone. I feel this review has gone on long enough and would like to end it here, although Cure Moonlight&#039;s character specifically can be analyzed for hours. I regret that this series was not one I enjoyed more, but it did give a solid effort. Final rating: 4/10.

    Heartcatch Precure was another disappointing Precure season for me. This will be spoiler free. <br />
<br />
Visuals: <br />
1) it&#039;s a drastic change from all previous seasons. It has a very cartoonish, very western style that I don&#039;t appreciate. I thought that maybe I would learn to like it but it wasn&#039;t the case; <br />
2) poor monster design <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
1) legendary seiyuus, as usual <br />
2) soundtrack was okay <br />
<br />
<br />
Story and characters: <br />
1) Overall, it&#039;s too predictable and repetitive to be enjoyable. Every single episode, aside from character introductions and the final showdown, follows the same exact script: present new character and theme, have them meet precure girls, have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409867">
        them be attacked by villains, have precure girls fight villians using the same old attacks without strategy whatsoever. 40 something episodes of this is boring and dull. <br />
2) The setting doesn&#039;t feel very Precure to me. The monsters lack creativity and a catchphrase like Uzaina or something. Not only that, but there are characters that are meant to be from older generations of Precure warriors and yet there isn&#039;t a single reference to any of the previous 6 seasons. There was even the perfect oportunity when we are introduced to the Precure Palace. <br />
3) The ending felt incredibly rushed. One episode we&#039;re still doing everyday episodes and on the next we get PLOT! The twists at the end didn&#039;t feel satisfying at all and the timeskip at the end made no sense whatsoever. <br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a 5/10 for me.
