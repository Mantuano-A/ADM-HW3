    I’m not sure why I picked Just Because! But anyway it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. <br />
<br />
The series at its core is a character-centric; which mean that no matter how the characters became; whether they&#039;re reach their goals or not, it is became a part of and affecting the story. There’s no big overarching plot to draw the viewers in actually. It’s pretty much about these five Student, and how their lives will play out over the next few months. The story essentially played out by the struggling of this character facing the transition to adulthood and also the problem they get when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266629">
        interacting with each other.<br />
<br />
It sounds like typical slice of life but certainly it doesn’t. What makes show a little bit different in my eyes is how &#039;calm&#039; the presentation is handled. Anime or most of high school anime in general tend to be bogged down by gimmicks, but it did not happen here. The mood is very calm and smooth, the pacing is deliberately slow, most of the characters are quiet and soft-spoken, making the show to be quite atmospheric. Of course being different doesn’t equal to being better, but at least it is nice that every now and then you could watch some drama where you can just sit back and relax and not getting pumped up by bizarre presentation.<br />
<br />
Having said that, since the story may sound quite alright at best, thankfully it did deliver (even more) on its focus which is the characters. Although, I have heard many peoples complain about the characters of this series because they seems had no personalities but certainly I am not one of these people. I personally think that the characters in this series is fantastic with each of them has their own motives and justify reason to do what they acts. <br />
Obviously in this series Komiya might be the clearest who has a motives for what she did; she just want to save her club; and doing anything to do so. Haruto always feels left behind. Everyone’s talking about entrance exams and going to college. They have their futures ahead of them. On the other hand, everything has already been decided for him, since he’ll need to work and he feels powerless. Hazuki’s college won’t have a band. At best, it has a band appreciation club. So for now, there are no plans to continue playing the trumpet once she graduates from high school. She failed to reach nationals in high school, so She feels it might be the best just try to graduate as soon as she can, and living normal life by join her family business. Mio is struggling with her college entrance exam and she can’t denied the fact that Haruto confessed to Hazuki and she likes Haruto. Eita doesn’t has any problem with his academics since he got a recommendation but then again he likes Mio, but Mio likes someone else, so he just trying his best to catch her attention. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless It is safe to say that the characters is quite interesting in their own way and had some setup to be fully developed till the end of the series. Although it is worth to mention they don’t have loud, tropey, tsundere or ‘genky’ characters. So the series  might not very ‘lively’ if you are the type to like some banter or comedy because there’s hardly any . But these character traits are not executed in such an overblown way that you end up thinking you’re interacting with zombies.  <br />
<br />
As for the visuals, it is worth to mention that the anime really likes to show its characters face exclusively and most of the time you can tell how the character’s feel or whether they’re lying or not which I think is quite interesting. As for the other thing in visual, the show does suffer from production issues.. a lot. The animation isn’t very quite standard of today. The characters perspective looks wrong and the backgrounds aren’t that amazing considering how many these guys are hanging out. Luckily enough, the anime doesn’t have the type of story that really demands any sort of visual fidelity and I don’t think I’ve heard or nor I did the studio behind this anime has much record on its names. <br />
<br />
As for sound, I like the Opening, “Over and Over” by Yanagi Nagi who also sung for ‘Oregairu’  I think her song and voiced very suited with school drama and this one is no different. The ending is another story because I tend to skip it so I may miss something there. The soundtrack is good albeit not memorable enough to catch your attention but it does serve is purpose. The acting is too plain and uninteresting for my taste but at the very least I don’t hate it. All In all the sound does it best to complement the story but none of it will blow you away (Maybe the opening though but I guess that just me). <br />
<br />
The very length of the series, which is just 12 episodes, also aids the story, as it is long enough to explore these characters to a point and not so long as to need more than what was presented. This made the anime simple and casual, giving the content of what was presented a bit more impact, without anything being stretched out for too long. <br />
<br />
Overall I wouldn’t go as far as say the anime is unique; In fact, one could say that the story is a remarkably common one. However at the very least the series stays clear of many of the annoyances of romance stories and not throwing in all kinds of situations solely intended to add drama and spice things up. Added with the fact that the series keeping up with the sense of realism (which I think done a great job) but never feels to depressing considering how the series ended. <br />
<br />
In this respect, I suppose I just appreciate Just Because!’s sharper focus. It’s far less ambitious, and far less grand in scope, but it did many many things correctly and easily became one of my favorite romance anime in recent years. <br />
<br />
Yes, the ending overall is quite pandering and certainly flashback are needed for the romance part. But we can&#039;t have all the nice things can we?

    In all honesty, the series tried very hard to portray youth as well as romance, but it failed greatly.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m a romance seeker myself. I love to experience either pure vanilla or train wreck romance stories. But then again, this one is neither of those two. The pace is non-existent and they seriously don&#039;t even know what the hell is going on. Worse, it mixed up all kinds of aspects altogether, to the point that I can pretty much say a chimera was born. The potential is wasted and the current story is not even worth much. While this series is original, the premises themselves are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267160">
        just as generic as they can get.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
It started with a bang and such, about how fate and red strings could bring all friends together to experience teenage love stories all over again. The main character, Eita Izumi, has come back to his hometown high school due to his father&#039;s work and starts to meet his old friend, Souma Haruto, as well as Natsume Mio, his one-sided crush. To simplify, there is also a new junior, Komiya Ena, who is faced with a crisis that her photography club might be disbanded. This story is about how all of them crossed each other&#039;s paths and lives, and they faced their hardships along the way. So where did it all go wrong?<br />
<br />
The story itself is already a whack. Plus, the same generic triangle loves story troupe. Make the series as bad as it can be. There is nothing new at all that makes this series worthwhile. Spice it up with uninteresting characters and their bland personalities. I felt so sorry for them as their presence itself was so weak. To be honest, you can even forget all about them after one day. The development is not even worthy of praise. Straightforwardly, it’s very boring and slow. As if it wasn&#039;t enough, the story pace is truly bad and the development between the characters is just almost nowhere. They don&#039;t even make the characters feel alive. The show also tries to be both happy and sad, but what I just see is just the same cycle of unsolved problems and running away. This would be fine if it was just a couple of episodes, but this problem stood up until the very end. What the hell?<br />
<br />
Character<br />
For goodness sake, this is the most annoying aspect of the series. They are so bland and childish, way beyond what teens do. Their stupidity level was just outrageous. I know everyone moves at their own pace. But I highly doubt that everyone can be that dumb. While it might be bad on some levels, I like some of them. It is just the way it portrays ruining the characters, for goodness sake. Eita Izumi, the only character that I do respect for his loyalty to his love. Although there is not much to see. Now comes the best pal, Souma Haruto, with his own love story. Needless to say, his character is so freaking bland, boring, not the best pal after all, and stoic. As the story progresses, his whole interaction does not leave any presence at all. Lastly, is our main heroine, Natsume Mio, who is indecisive beyond help without any little push. It’s okay to be a little indecisive, but her indecisiveness and running away are just plain torture. Where exactly are the unique and interesting traits? Kindness? Lovely? Her whole existence is just trash. The junior, Komiya Ena, is far more interesting. She’s kind and has the spirit to achieve her own goals and dreams. She is much more realistic and feels alive than the rest of the main cast.<br />
<br />
Animation &amp; Music<br />
The animation is just so-so. If you notice, sometimes the characters&#039; faces can look weird. But it is fair enough considering all the trashier points we&#039;ve accumulated so far. As for music, I love it. It’s inspiring, interesting and full of vivid colors. Other than that, there are no more worthwhile points to be pointed out.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
I had my share of fun, but the series was far from good. The premise itself was interesting at first, but the actual story wasn’t. The flaws are just as bad as they can get, and the development is truly pathetic if I have to say. It could go further, but sadly, that path is just a loophole as of now.

    Senior year of high school is like a train station. <br />
<br />
Pick a train to decide your future. You can’t say for sure what lies at your destination, but you know for certain it will take you away from your school and friends you made there. This is the theme that Just Because puts forward with its story of seniors deciding their futures and many train station scenes. However, it does not have the intimacy necessary for these themes to be believable.<br />
<br />
Slice of life shows live or die on how intimate they are. And no, I do not mean romance. I mean the show&#039;s connection to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266634">
        the audience. Without that crucial connection, you might as well be watching bugs run around for all it matters. A lack of intimacy is what prevents Just Because from being engaging. <br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the show has subtle character interactions that allow the viewer to make their own interpretations, but when it’s so hard to give a damn about any of them it’s impossible to feel engaged to anything happening on screen. <br />
<br />
[Story: 4/10]<br />
After elementary school, you typically fall apart from your classmates. The story of Just Because is those kids coming back together in high school and meeting up again. Eita Izumi left his town after elementary school but now that he has transferred back to his friends&#039; town he is reconnecting with them. The story is as basic as it needs to be for the slice-of-life and romance genres. We&#039;ve seen this structure many times over, and it is not at all improved upon in this show. It follows 5 high school students through their everyday lives. They study to get into universities, hone their talents, and try to get dates. The show jumps around at such an inconsistent pace between the 5 characters that it&#039;s hard to get a grip on who they are and what motivates them, beyond a shallow description. Characters walk around or sit about with bored looking expressions on their faces, forcing the viewer to mimic their feelings. <br />
<br />
Just Because wouldn&#039;t be the first show I recommend to someone interested in a realistic young adult romance. I wish I could say that the characters make up for what the show lacks in story, but they don’t. In the first few episodes, the story moves at a snail&#039;s pace, giving us a few small details about the central characters but also long drawn out scenes to establish atmosphere. Eventually, the pacing gets better. Once all of the characters are clearly established the final half of the show is made up of somewhat entertaining if overwrought melodrama over little petty moments. Moments like going on certain characters going out on dates then the effects it has on the third wheel who&#039;s in love with one of the two on the date (trying to keep it spoiler-free, sorry to be vague). <br />
<br />
I&#039;d say I was disappointed by the ending, but it really is consistent with expectations the show instills in its audience. It&#039;s a bleak and quiet moment that puts forth the theme one last time &#039;there&#039;s beauty in simplicity&#039;, but it felt so undeserved to me. It felt like a contradiction to the build-up in the previous episodes and I couldn&#039;t help but think &quot;Why couldn&#039;t this have happened six episodes ago?&quot;. Very little of the melodrama experienced throughout the prior episodes felt necessary by the end. <br />
<br />
[Character: 5/10]<br />
Just Because aims to create realistic characters, yet it fails to develop them enough to even be believable. Sure, very boring people like these characters could exist in the real world, but who would want to subject themselves to watching their bland lives? <br />
<br />
Some of them are sort of likable (if you can tolerate their personalities) but I didn’t care for any of them individually. The only time I was ever interested in the characters was when they were with one another. Whether it be their arguments, them making fond memories, or considering their futures. I just couldn’t get myself to care about them while they stare off into space trying to seem deep. We get it Just Because! Your characters are so tragic! They&#039;re going to college, wow! Maybe you can tell us something else about them… like who they are as people beyond the fact that they’re going to college next year. For example; Haruto plays baseball and likes a girl, great, who is he though? Why does he like her? Is there anything more to his life than baseball and a crush? All signs say no. <br />
<br />
This sentiment could be applied to any of the leads. I found them to be very one-sided and it destroyed the potential for Just Because to be an intimate slice of life. The show only takes it&#039;s characters halfway to becoming good, then it stops leaving us half-baked hollow shells (filled with awkward silences and depression). In the end, I just couldn’t see the characters as the real people that they were intended to be. There was not enough believability. Even Komiya, the character I liked the most for her outgoing personality, had very little going on besides her camera and crush.  <br />
<br />
What makes me the saddest about the characters is that they were nearly good. We&#039;re able to get in the headspace of a character and tell if they concealing their emotions, and sometimes if they&#039;re lying through the abundance of close-up shots and a very consistent tone. However, the art is pretty bad so those close-ups are ugly and the tone so depressing that it seems to only want to pointlessly wear down your spirit. With a better writer and director, they could have had the believability to compliment their likable personalities. <br />
<br />
At least I can say I got into each of the characters&#039; headspaces and became depressed just like they were. But that headspace was totally vacant of interesting details!! I can relate to the IDEA of high schoolers who are struggling to decide their futures at the crossroads of their lives, but no amount of relatable ideas will get me invested in these cardboard cutouts.<br />
<br />
[Art: 4/10]<br />
Pine Jam dropped the ball on this one. Their last show Gamers didn’t look nearly as rough as this. It’s plagued with weak character art and poor animation. I’m not sure if it was just a simple budget issue or if they couldn’t handle a project as intimate as this, but it to put it bluntly; it’s harsh on the eyes. If you want to make a quiet coming of age story then you need close-ups to get the audience into the character’s headspace. That&#039;s not to say that Just Because doesn’t try to close-ups, but when it does they’re so ugly you&#039;ll wish the camera would zoom back out.<br />
<br />
The backgrounds look nice if a bit gray. I can praise how the mellow colors of the characters and backgrounds blend together. It makes the characters feel just as melancholy as the cold winter town, but keep in mind the show strives to make you feel this depressing atmosphere. <br />
<br />
What weighs down the visuals the most is the lackluster directing. Most scenes have very boring camera angles, usually pulled far back from the characters making them feel very disconnected from the viewer. Rarely does the director create intimate moments that connect the viewer to a character, they usually feel like random extras in a greater story that has yet to materialize. Even during the scenes in the characters&#039; homes, there is very little detail to show who those characters are. Their rooms are devoid of defining details. So many opportunities to create believable characters were missed, it&#039;s sad really, to see a director waste such great potential. <br />
There’s a bit of CGI usage during the later episodes to no doubt to cut down on the budget (most notably that awkward and overlong first-person bicycling scene).<br />
<br />
[Sound: 5/10]<br />
The opening song is quite good but it sounds very similar to Oregairu’s. Which shouldn’t come as a surprise considering they’re both performed by Nagi Yanagi. I would feel more inclined to score it higher if it didn’t feel like a simple rehashing of an op from a better show in the same genre. <br />
Most scenes have music playing which is nice to keep the show from becoming entirely empty during the simpler scenes. Typically it&#039;s orchestral music with a piano at the core. It highlights the mundanity of life by being so basic and plain, but yeah that plainness is boring as hell so... If that thematic consistency sounds appealing to you then maybe it will add something to your experience with it. I think it does a decent job of establishing tone, but I couldn&#039;t care less about how it actually sounds because there have been so many fantastic soundtracks of its kind in this year alone. This one&#039;s just passable. <br />
The voices are just as monotonous as you’d expect. I&#039;d love to say this isn&#039;t a waste of acting talent, but I honestly can&#039;t tell if any of them are talented because they&#039;re all forced to perform the same subdued style which gives them little opportunity to give the character some individuality/distinction. Excluding Haruto, his voice actor had a few scenes that allowed us to see his talent, but sadly he was just one of the ensemble cast. And due to the overbearing melancholy tone of the show, he was rarely able to be his peppy self.<br />
 <br />
[Enjoyment: 3/10]<br />
It’s so disappointing that the comedy in Just Because is bad because in the creator’s previous work “The Pet Girl of Sakurasou” the humor was spot on and made me laugh a lot. There was plenty of good drama in Sakurasou which managed to come across fairly well in Just Because, if only it wasn’t so damn boring.<br />
<br />
Its attempts at comedy are dreadful. Typically when jokes are said there is very little feedback and sometimes you can’t tell if it was a joke or just confused writing. The show also uses the social media application Line to show messages between characters. The messages are usually dressed to look like humor with emoticons and such, but the messages are so nondescript that it could be anyone who is texting, they don&#039;t at all add to the characters or relatability.<br />
<br />
The reason why I&#039;m so tough on Just Because is that it has taken on a challenge. If Just Because strived to be just another one of the trashy romcoms that we get every season then I would treat it like trash and just move. <br />
However, Just Because has a chooses to be realistic and mundane. I don&#039;t believe the creator understood just how difficult it would be to make a compelling viewing experience with such a barren presentation. Instead of aiming to be great, it settled on mediocrity, which may have made for a passable show if it was just another harem romcom, but it makes this one feel incredibly underdone. No part of Just Because! is deserving of the exclamation point at the end of its title.<br />
<br />
Boredom ≠ Good<br />
<br />
[Overall Score: 4/10]<br />
If you want a standard (and forgettable) high school drama/romance then Just Because has what you’re looking for. That is, as long as you can live with the alienating direction, subpar character art, and a crushingly depressing tone. The humor is cringe-inducing and never funny, but at least the melodrama in the second half is moderately entertaining. There can be beauty in simplicity, but nothing in Just Because is beautiful and everything is bland. While it has the bones of a good slice of life show, it fails to come together in an engaging way.

    High school can be quite an experience for most young people these days. I remember a time during my high school years when everything seems to feel different. It’s almost like setting foot into a new world with new opportunities. Friends, activities, relationships. It’s a place beyond just about learning but for people to build a future. While it isn’t like college for career building, it definitely gives the chance for opportunities, even for relationships. For Eita Izumi, he comes back from his hometown after 4 years as he reunites with his middle school friends.<br />
<br />
As an original anime, Just Because felt like a breath of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266619">
        fresh air despite the simplistic premise. It’s also made by Hajime Kamoshida, the brainchild behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. To me, this show stood out as a coming age of story about characters climbing the stairs to adolescence. It’s a time period for characters to develop and grow up to be more than teenagers. At the heart of the show, we have Eita Izumi alongside a group of classmates. The first few episodes gave me the impression of a melancholic story that’s filled with realistic themes that people can connect with. Beyond just the setting, the characters feel real and can be relatable. This is seen through the example of childhood friends Eita, Haruto, and Mio. As the story progresses, we see the relationship dynamics between the trio that will get viewers invested into the storytelling.<br />
<br />
For a show like this to work, it had to make its characters feel they belong there. Luckily, Just Because pulls off the right stops through its characters of diverse personalities. Each of the main characters feel different ranging from Mio’s timid personality to Ena’s enthusiasm. It’s what can draw viewers in as we see how they behave around certain characters. Indeed, character chemistry is an important aspect of this show. It connects between characters visually, dramatically, and meaningfully. Romance is slowly paced and not expressed like a shoujo but rather in a melancholic style. To me, this show focuses on relationships through character building. It emphasizes on establishing character personalities first while giving them the chance to shine through them. Ena is a prime example in the show as her character interaction with Eita is often noticeable because of how different she is from him. Some people may interpret the show’s character relationship dynamics as part of destiny, like certain characters are destined to be with one another. However, that’s not truly the case as expectations can be different after realizing the person they want to be with isn’t what they would expect. Honestly, I think this show sells its ideas pretty well to express that.<br />
<br />
To make things run better, the show never forgets about its themes such as adolescence. Every character has a goal for the future and although there’s a feeling of uncertainty, they strive to work towards that. Whether it’s becoming a photographer, be part of a band, or just to go to college, it’s inspiring and realistic. Think about the time when you were in high school and had that feeling of what you wanted to do in life. Relating to this anime doesn’t feel so different, now does it? At the same time, the storytelling continues to build relationships between the main characters. While it feels like a ship tease at times, the show never exaggerates or oversteps its boundaries. The drama is mostly lighthearted and doesn’t force it down viewers’ throats. It keeps its pace steady while getting its point across, like the way it should be. In several ways, the drama of this show is realistic enough to relate and easy to get attached to. There are some awkward segments between certain characters but the timing usually feels right. The downside about the drama is that it occasionally feels formulaic and repetitive. Not to mention, character relationships feel a bit predictable as to who will likely get who in the end. Still, it doesn’t hold the anime back. The characters are all very self-aware and realize what it means to be a high school student. Haruto is a good example as we see his life as a baseball player. The way he adapts to build his future becomes evident like a journey of life discovery. This also expands to other characters such as Mio and Ena. It’s like their chance to climb the stairs to adulthood and high school is one of the biggest steps they have to cross over.<br />
<br />
Original anime like Just Because doesn’t suffer from adaptation standards but there’s an instinct to recognize if the amount of episode is suited enough. For 12 episodes, it honestly felt just right to sell its story without going over. The first half of the show does a well job at establishing characters like their personalities and roles. The remainder half builds on them through relationships, discoveries, and characterization. It’s like a life journey these characters take for their future and stories like this can be inspirational to viewers. <br />
<br />
Adapted by Pine Jam, this show is expressive at crafting its visual elements. The key visual itself gives an atmospheric feel with characters being at a train station. Besides Eita and Mio, the others are going on about their daily lives like moving with their future. By raw quality though, Just Because’s biggest selling point is the character expressions. It fortifies their personalities and expresses attitude that connects with their personalities. It’s important to realize that human expressions often depict what a person feels at every moment. This anime does a clever job at capitalizing that to make them feel real. On the other hand, I can’t say the character designs are too impressive. Most of the main characters look too normal while the female cast doesn’t stand out much dynamically. Photography is also a part of the show itself and some of the photos taken by Ena doesn’t really make memorable impressions. Still, I think the show hits mark overall. Every character feels very alive and moves the story together.<br />
<br />
For soundtrack and music, it’s clear that Just Because needed a melancholic style to make it work. Thankfully, this is accomplished thanks to the music director for its creative themes. It’s lighthearted, slow paced, and consistent to make every segment work. Both the theme songs has a very realistic tone and lyrics that matches with the style of the show. Character voice mannerism is also important to convey character personalities and it hits the mark just right. The dialogues makes the characters sound believable and that’s what it’s important.<br />
<br />
Four years of high school really can really be quite an experience. For some people, it can feel like a quest to start a new life. For others, it may be like living a world of hell. Then, there are people who think high school may just be part of their journey to adulthood and there’s much more ahead. The characters in this show embarks on that journey and takes the viewers with them. For that reason, Just Because is worth watching as it explores high school relationships, making memories, and discovering what life really means.

    *Minimum Spoiler Nostalgic Review*<br />
TL;DR: Love Pentagon between high school teenagers trying to figure out their future while keeping their emotional spillage in check. Also... Just Because. <br />
[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 5/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#039;s all in the past&quot; - Eita Izumi<br />
<br />
Just Because is an original anime by Hajime Kamoshida, the genius behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. However, just because at a first glance it may seem like this is a generic story about confused intertwined love relationships between group of friends trying to get through high school, the adaptation feels way to close to reality. For those that finished high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266635">
        or those finishing up high school, it will definitely bring back memories of your teen years. This anime shines in the tear-jerking nostalgia department and just because of that, it outshines from the rest of the generic love stories in the ever popular genres of slice of life combined with romance and school. From it&#039;s use of orchestra music to piano accompanied backdrops whilst looking back at your past, despite it&#039;s suboptimal animation standard given it&#039;s by the studio Pine Jam, this under the radar anime is definitely worth the watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#039;ve only given valentine cards to my dad and my two brothers every year&quot; - Hazuki Morikawa <br />
<br />
Just because the story is generic doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be interesting. The story in a nutshell is about the transfer student Eita Izumi, who moves back again and attends the same high school all of his friends from middle school goes to as well. Reuniting with them once again reignites all the unresolved love and drama they had between each other plus coupled with the new friends they make in high school further alleviates this love triangle to an all out love pentagon between each other. The story for this anime is simple but its the character interactions that gives its complexity. At it&#039;s core, the plot is linear driven however flashbacks from middle school days are used to explain why each character behaves at certain situations. It takes two episodes to get used to the rhythm of the anime but given what a stellar first episode was and how the anime continue to build up with the different characters trying to figure out their feelings for one another while trying to finish high school and graduate, really makes it worthwhile to watch. Who doesn&#039;t love riding the nostalgia train.   <br />

&quot;Can I ask him out on a date?&quot; - Ena Komiya<br />
<br />
Just because the characters appear mundane at first does not mean they do not possess complexity. The fun part about this anime are the characters. At its core the five major characters are: Eita Mizumi (the transfer student with a crush on Natsume), Haruto Soma (best friend of Eita with a crush on Morikawa), Natusme Mio (old friends from middle school with crush on Haruto), Morikawa Hazuki (band chick too shy to confess), &amp; Ena Komiya (CANON camera chick too eager to confess to Eita). This complex love pentagon really drives this show. This anime takes its time developing each of the characters and giving them enough time and backstory to justify their importance and reason for the love they have for the other. Not to mention because each character acts as a foil for the other and how unique each of their personalities are, you really start to identify yourself with one of these characters. Soon enough you will be cheering on for your favourite ship while reminiscing about your old high school ship. Like I said, all aboard the nostalgia train. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you tell him I&#039;ll kill you” - Natsume Mio <br />
<br />
Just because the animation is subpar doesn&#039;t mean the music has to be subpar. Given the fact that the studio adapting this anime is Pine Jam, a rather small studio not really known for their outstanding animation standards, they&#039;ve done not too shabby of a job adapting this original anime. There were a few scenes that weren&#039;t blended well and seemed a bit choppy however, the overall pencil drawn characters gave it a nice cozy feel to the anime. It&#039;s funny how despite each of the major characters being completely unique to one another, they were drawn pretty similar to one another. It could be that it serves as a metaphor for life how we may think we are completely different from our friend sitting next to us in class but we are more similar than we think in the hardship and struggle we go through in our adolescence and teenage years with school and love. Aside from the animation what really sells this anime is the music. From the first episode and onwards the quality of the music never drops. From the usage of trumpets and drums to build the tension up to calm relaxing piano medley to reminisce about the past, this show knew how to use it all. Not to mention the OP and ED songs are both amazing to listen to on their own. It really stands out as a complete OST to listen to on its own. Lastly, the seiyuus for this show did a great job in giving life to these characters. Kudos to them. <br />

Overall, Just Because was a simple anime with a generic premise that surpassed expectations it set for itself. It was not only a great coming of age story dealing with high school love and struggle of school to figure out your future, it served its purpose as a nostalgic ride to let viewers reminisce about their past. As the story progressed you start identifying yourself with the characters in the anime and though it was a slice of life anime featuring a love pentagon, it wasn&#039;t a cookie cutter romantic plot that made itself predictable from the start. Plus, who ends up with who in the end will really surprise the viewers. For that reason alone and just because how many puns you can make while watching this anime, I would highly recommend to everyone, not just fans of this genre, to give this anime a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite ship and your favourite quote from the anime!  <br />

P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!<br />

    the first episode throw me off little bit , but i decided to keep watching and so far its look pretty heart warming , its my favorite type of slice of life anime, no exaggerated comedy , heart warming and slow pacing , the character are little by too cliché, the love triangles and the unnecessary screaming gets in the way of enjoying the anime, the art is great although there one thing that i find annoying but its opinion based which the finger nails color change in the close shots which is not exclusive to this anime but i find it annoying , but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262649">
        all in all its relatable and feels good to watch and i hope it stays this way...

    I would like to straight away point out the fact, all that happened in 12 episodes, ending makes no sense, no development is shown leading towards the outcome of the ending.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS:<br />
Best girl looses, despite putting in so much effort and her character was the most developed. and we end up with the girl who liked the MC&#039;s friend and out of nowhere realizes her feelings for MC. No development is shown for ,for the MC, ending makes no sense. Bullshit.<br />
<br />
Thats all I have to say for this anime, feel like I wasted my time watching it, komiya best girl forever.

    It&#039;s an excellent anime, with interesting characters and amazing storyline. Involves multiple love triangles and deals with real feelings of high school children. It&#039;s probably one of the best slice of life anime I&#039;ve watched so far and definitely deserves a 10!<br />
<br />
The development of the personalities of various characters and how an event is shown from multiple viewpoints is a lot like what happens everyday. Misunderstandings, confessions, unrequited love, liking someone, finding your place in the world; that is all portrayed in the series.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve watched it twice, and even the second time round it had an effect on me!

When I first read over the synopsis for Just Because I couldn&#039;t wait to get my hands on the episodes. As a young adult not so recently out of high school myself, I wanted to torture myself by relieving the anxieties and emotions that run high during the last few months of senior year. And so as the story progressed, I couldn&#039;t help but feel disappointed in what was presented to me.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was my own fault for having such high hopes for the anime, but what could&#039;ve been a compelling story full of heartbreak, fear for the future, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266835">
        new hope, felt like a watered down version with ironically little depth. The story focused on a select few students, which was fine at first. That&#039;s where all the juicy bits of drama will go down, right? This is where friendships will break apart for the sake of final exams! This is where the long-standing relationship will feel the strain of their romantic clock ticking away until they have to part ways! But instead, what I found in that small group of friends was yet another cliched love triangle. (And let&#039;s be honest, we all knew where THAT was going).<br />
<br />
I found myself having to force myself to continue, although I did manage to get through all 12 hellishly boring episodes while all the while hoping for something, anything, to HAPPEN. I&#039;m no stranger to slice of life anime, I know they aren&#039;t supposed to be action-packed or anything but jesus, in an anime about a bunch of teenagers having to leave behind their friends and find a place for themselves in society I was expecting a few tears at the very least.<br />
<br />
Just Because had so much potential and instead, it fell flat. The emotions never went deep enough, the drama never felt dramatic enough, it was almost like the characters just drifted through the story instead of it actually happening to them. Because of this, Just Because is currently sitting with a score of 3 on my list.

    An original anime that have a lot of potential to be great but ends so disappointing.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Story: 3/10]<br />
<br />
The story is slow (and with bad pacing) in most of episodes, mostly in the episodes 1-4 and 9-11. Sometimes some scenes are out of place, for example the baseball scenes with the adults in the middle. <br />
<br />
[Character: 3/10]<br />
<br />
Besides Komiya and maybe Haruto, all the characters feels boring, lack of personality and are one-sided. Komiya and his outgoing personality makes great moments for the anime, more that most of the main cast. Haruto in some scenes is good, in others not so much. Eita is boring character unless he

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266766">
        is with Komiya.<br />
Their moments with Natsume feels awkward and out of place. Morikawa lacks of personality until the last episodes. I like the friend of Morikawa, Yoriko. Finally, Nastume, a character that is so jealous and indecisive that feels annoying and as a plot device in much episodes. The worst part is that the anime is pro-Natsume and anti-Komiya.<br />
<br />
[Art: 6/10]<br />
<br />
I like the animation despite some episodes (ex. 5) have bad animated scenes. <br />
<br />
[Sound: 5/10]<br />
<br />
I have no problems with the soundrack. In my opinion, is not bad neither good. The opening is forgettable anyway.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment: 4/10]<br />
<br />
Again, the only moments with decent comedy are Eita/Ena and Haruto. The scenes with Natsume makes me angry, she is jealous because Eita is with Komiya when she have some feelings for Haruto (because of an erase, really? ). I like the scenes with Yoriko, Haruto (sometimes) and Komiya, they are worth of watching.<br />
<br />
Overall <br />
<br />
Just Because! is bad. If Eita have ended up with Ena, it will receive a 6 or maybe 7 of my part but nope, a generic ending with the main girl that did nothing in the entire show. Poor Komiya.  4/10<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m a big fan of the romance/drama type of slice of life, which is why I was fairly happy to stumble upon Just Because! in this season. Mood and setting of the anime are quite fitting for winter, so you&#039;ll be likely to identify when watching this right now.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The anime starts off with a transfer student coming back to Tokyo for his last half year of high school, after his father was transferred back from Fukuoka. He&#039;s soon reunited with his long lost best friend from middle school and is finding himself confronted with some unresolved things from the past. As the story continues, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262507">
        characters have to face the reality of graduation and resolving  their plans for the future, while love and disappointments are quite hard to handle too. <br />
This seems quite uninteresting at first -you know, just your typical life of life story- but the characters get interesting and after two episodes I was hooked.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art, well, nothing all too special, but the natural colors and realistic settings (if you were in Tokyo (Enoshima) before, you&#039;ll recognize some parts) are comforting and easy to watch. The story is set in winter and the colors are therefore not too saturated. I like the character design because it&#039;s not too &#039;sparkly&#039;, the characters have their own trademarks and don&#039;t look all the same. Another thing that I found to be interesting was the format of dialogue via messaging, as the characters use a lot of LINE.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
It&#039;s super refreshing to hear some new voices, especially Izumi and Natsume&#039;s seiyuu sound super good and I hope they&#039;ll get more jobs soon! The BGM is subtle and there are some nice pieces from time to time too, I&#039;d say it underlines the plot when it has to.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Very diverse cast and character development is expected (Episode 5). I like how the characters have their families introduced as well, their motives are clear and you get attached to them very easily. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
The theme of this anime and the general undertone are quite melancholic and emotional. It displays the different notions of adulthood and difficulty of being honest with your feelings, as sometimes you&#039;ll just don&#039;t know what is best for yourself in this moment. Will you be able to keep up with the people you love when you tell them you do, even though they&#039;re precious friends and you might lose them? Or would you rather shut all those feelings uptight in your heart and deny they&#039;re even there? Do you even want to know? If you ever were confronted with those questions, have a look at this anime. I think it might carry a very soothing subliminal message.

    I liked this show. A lot. This is my favorite romance anime. It is a great complete story that does not leave on a undecided lover like most shows these days. It wraps up it story completely and concisely not overstaying its welcome by dragging out the plot and leaving on a cliffhanger to boost sells of another work. I think the anime being an original plays a part in that, but regardless, this is truly an anime that you should watch if you enjoy romance. The emotions that this anime invoke is something that I haven&#039;t felt from an anime in such a long

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370753">
        time. I was able to connect to the story deeply and felt very invested in the drama and characters to the point where I couldn&#039;t choose a favorite couple and felt legitimately satisfied by whomever the character was going to choose at the end. The romance was grounded by realism and the characters were the most realistic I&#039;ve seen in an anime. A particular realistic scenario the characters had to consider was their future. Whether it be continuing their college career or joining the workforce, putting them in a dilemma as to whether they should even date at all. This realism hits all too close to home as a senior that is close to graduation and made me further enjoy the anime. To me this is the perfect high school romance anime. The atmosphere is great, the realism is great, the characters are great, and the end is great. Truly a great anime and I&#039;d highly recommend it.

    Please note that there are spoilers below. This is primarily due to the fact that my main points cannot be conveyed without explaining specific events in the story. Sections with spoilers will be marked.<br />
<br />
Now when I first watched this anime I was attracted to its warm and calm atmosphere, something that is rarely seen in anime filled up with comedic scenes and the like. I liked the protagonist who was not like another blithering idiot that romance/sol/high school anime usually focus on. It was fine, and I liked it so much I regarded it on par with the other big two of this season (inuyashiki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266793">
        and ancient magus bride) The OP sounded great, and the anime had a lot going for it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this was overshadowed by major issues, in particular the ideas that this anime seeks to promote. <br />
<br />
STORY: 3<br />
The story is generic and involves the usual anime-tropes seen in the genres this show is in. It does not deviate from what we would expect and the ending is extremely predictable. Often J do not focus much on  a show&#039;s ending as I believe in the process of story-telling more than the ending itself. However this show does not offer anything out of the ordinary and what was originally calm and soothing becomes boring. However that&#039;s not entirely why the story gets such a low score. As this is a romance-drama anime, its story is largely intertwined with its characters. Therefore, if the anime has bad characters who make bad decisions there will be a bad story.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
The art is average. There are some awkward expressions but otherwise it is fine.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Having listened to Yanagi Nagi and Jun Maeda&#039;s Owari no Hoshi no Love Song the anime opening didn&#039;t fall short. It provided an appropriate atmosphere for the show (calm and soothing) and I liked it. The ending was less impressive, but more or less alright.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1 (Minor spoilers)<br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s main and most damning problem is its cast of characters who feel more like cardboard cutouts. They&#039;re the kind of characters who talk and let the viewer know directly what their goals are but never actually demonstrate their intent, which is an extremely lazy way of building a character. The characters never pursue what they want and feel very much like cardboard cutouts. They don&#039;t blush, don&#039;t spend time together, don&#039;t actively pursue their goals. This will be further elaborated in the next section, enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3 <br />
<br />
The problem with the characters is only symptomatic of a larger problem here: The main message of the anime, or the values it holds. Allow me to explain how the problem with the characters is related to this.<br />
<br />
MAJOR SPOILERS HERE<br />
<br />
After watching the anime I have come to learn that Natsume is a quiet studious girl and she likes Eita, and she was the ex-president. That&#039;s all. There is nothing else about her personality that is known to us and her thoughts and feelings are never revealed to us.  An example: She liked Soma and eventually reconsiders this, but we never really understand why exactly she did that. Some might argue that it was probably because Eita has been helping her out, but it&#039;s all just speculation and no direct confirmation. This would have been a nitpick if it were an insignificant plot device but it&#039;s not an insignificant plot device. It is something that has to be told to the viewer to get them invested in the main girl. To make matters worse it&#039;s not even safe to assume that she simply had a crush on Soma and wasn&#039;t serious from the start. There are just so many possibilities as to why she had given up on Soma and why she liked him in the first place. After all, she had been crushing on him for several years now and we know nothing of how she feels. She seems very fickle when it comes to this. And that&#039;s just one point.<br />
<br />
Natsume and Eita&#039;s &quot;friendship&quot; (if you could call it that) is weak and all Natsume did was put her studies first. Rita questions her as to whether she was using it as an excuse but was shut down immediately. Perhaps the original intent was to create tension between the main characters. But they were never close in the first place and all it did was  show me how distant the two are. She had no intention to pursue her crush (soma at that time) and when she suddenly switched to Eita i always get reminded of someone picking food off a menu. There&#039;s no indication whatsoever that she likes someone even if she says she does, she doesn&#039;t smile, she doesn&#039;t blush, she doesn&#039;t go out of her way to do something (the same applies for Morikawa, but at least she never actually said she liked soma, it was more of accepting -- or postponing -- his confession)<br />
All in all, Natsume feels like a cardboard cutout. <br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we have a more well-made character, who unfortunately is shoved to the side. Komiya.<br />
<br />
The reason why people adore and support Komiya with Eita is that unlike Natsume, she knows what she wants and actively pursues it even though she has lots to lose. She actively shows us that she likes Eita and isn&#039;t fickle with her feelings. This is seen in the final episode when Eita graduates. She doesn&#039;t give up when things get tough; she&#039;s tenacious. She&#039;s everything Natsume is not. And most importantly, she actually has chemistry with eita. They joke, they talk, they help one another out. On the other hand Natsume never spared a thought for Eita and there was zero to no interaction.<br />
<br />
In the end, I realised what the main message of the show was: that love is determined by fate. Komiya fought but lost because it was fate. Natsume won because it was fate. Rita chose Natsume not because of her personality but because &quot;I&#039;ve liked her for a ling time&quot;. (I quoted Eita). I chose her because I feel it is meant to be, not because of how wonderful she is, not how she makes me feel, not how much she cares about me. I find this idea very distasteful and seeing Komiya lose out was very heartbreaking. <br />
<br />
For those who say it&#039;s realistic, maybe it is in portraying how we make bad choices in choosing romantic partners. Otherwise, it&#039;s not. Natsume&#039;s character is extreme in how fickle and non-chalant she is, as with Morikawa and even Eita to a certain extent. <br />
<br />
My opinion? This anime is not realistic. It is NOT a realistic portrayal of how people act in real life and it is NOT realistic in how people get rewarded for nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
This was a major letdown.<br />

    ~WARNING: EXPECT MINOR SPOILERS~<br />
<br />
(A 6 to me means that this anime is slightly above average at where I am currently watrching)<br />
<br />
What keeps me watching this anime, along with the reason why I decided to write this review is that it reminded me of one truly important fact, one I hope resonates with you in the future:<br />
<br />
THERE IS BEAUTY IN SIMPLICITY.<br />
<br />
As this review is being made while this show is in progress, most of what I say is subject to change at my discretion. As the name of the anime implies, I truly did watch this anime &quot;Just Because.&quot; (You can shoot me later for that).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261885">
        Interestingly enough, I will begin by saying I&#039;m actually enjoying the anime for what it is so far, though I hope to see improvements in both pacing and detail as time goes on.<br />
<br />
Story ~5~<br />
<br />
As of episode 3, the story from my perspective is average. A handful of students who are about to graduate slowly change as one of their childhood friends moves back after four years. As this is a slice of life, I got what I expected in the first few episodes: Reunions, re-connections, and changes in relations and communication relative to each character. Nothing particularly stands out story-wise, though I believe that is fine in a &quot;Slice-of-life&quot;, especially this early on.<br />
<br />
Art ~7~<br />
<br />
Most people seem to be on-or-off with the art, which is understandable because of how much the art shifts in detail between scenes. Throughout the first episode alone, I was taken aback at the stunning background art melding with the animations. The fluidity between 2d and 3d movement impressed me, and I could hardly make out when they genuinely used CG during certain scenes. <br />
<br />
Despite their successes detailing art and animation, the anime has the drawback of decreasing character detail during faster animations, such as in the baseball scene in episode 1. As for the characters looking &quot;Plain&quot;, I see nothing wrong in a realistic anime with realistic designs, regardless of blandness, especially with the beautiful background scenes.<br />
<br />
Sound ~9~<br />
<br />
WELL HELLO THERE. I will say now I am HEAVILY biased towards the orchestral/piano side of music, otherwise I may have given the sound more of a 6-7 score. Allow me the pleasure of saying that the tonality of each piece fits into each scene perfectly so far, most especially in the climax of the baseball &quot;duel&quot; at the end of episode 1. The joys of reconnecting and success in one scene, along with the subtle peaceful string instruments and slightly awkward beats during piano pieces help make each scene come alive. In anime, a media form where emotion can be conveyed through more than just its characters, music can become a &quot;make-or-break&quot; factor. I can confidently say that this anime certainly does NOT break.<br />
<br />
Character ~5~<br />
<br />
*sigh* Well hello there. Welcome to single scenes that establish every character and the awkwardness of not being at a point where any true conflict has occurred to allow any true emotional development. At this point, I have no choice but to give the characters a 5 simply because the anime hasn&#039;t developed enough to show me any depth behind many of the main characters besides their given personalities.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment ~6~<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain for those of you who don&#039;t understand why I could give a slice of life in its early boring stages a 6/10 (which IS good), allow me to restate: There is Beauty in Simplicity. That&#039;s truly what this anime is: Simple. That&#039;s what I truly expect out of any slice-of-life anime I watch. The music, art, and potential of this anime impresses me, as did 3-gatsu no Lion; one of my favorite anime to this day. I truly understood it during the second half of episode one: allow me to warn you:<br />
<br />
~SPOILERS~<br />
<br />
During the second half of episode one, the MC finds one of his old friends from their baseball club. Their dynamic after four years is awkward and stoic. The school baseball team has recently failed their attempt at winning nationals and his friend wants to hit one home run as both revenge and as a &quot;prayer&quot;. The MC (Who hasn&#039;t played for years) pitches for the friend, and the band members watching play a beautifully empowering piece in the background. Eventually, all the other main characters watch as the piece slows to a beautiful string orchestral piece as we see a slowed down home run, after which the MC&#039;s friend runs and hugs him, laughs, and proceeds to leave to confess to a girl he likes.<br />
<br />
THIS SCENE CONVEYS SO MUCH. The reunion and re connection between close friends, the attachment and encouragement a shared hobby gives between characters, the joy of mutual success, the awe of simply watching as the scene truly comes to life in its climax. That emotion paints a picture describing what I&#039;m talking about. That&#039;s the beauty in simplicity.<br />
<br />
Overall: ~6~<br />
The reason my overall is so low is because the anime hasn&#039;t given me enough to truly know whether or not it is &quot;good&quot;. So far, I&#039;m enjoying the ride, and have probably ranted long enough. As the anime continues, I hope for the pace to quicken, drama to occur, and ships to both sail and sink, all set to beautiful music pieces.

    Just Because! is a relatively slow-paced anime which focuses on a group of students in their last year of high school, approaching the end of their school days. Along with that, they must make important decisions for their future, as well as for the each person likes.<br />
<br />
All characters develop at different speeds when they come to realize their feelings.  That&#039;s what this anime clearly showed. Each of the characters thought in their own way to come to have the courage to be together with the person they like. This anime is pretty distinctive in that aspect, which was what i liked.<br />
<br />
Along with the romance,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266641">
        you&#039;ve got all the characters&#039; futures to be decided. Some of them don&#039;t know, some of them already decided and others don&#039;t care as long as they get a decent job. The fact that they used the last year of high school  is particularly effective in presenting the amount of pressure on all of them as they also have to consider what to do to make a move on the person they love. I guess that&#039;s why a lot of anime series use this time to create some drama.<br />
<br />
I liked the art, it fitted well with the melancholic mood of the anime throughout. But their were times when it was not at its best, the movements looked pretty forced at times too. <br />
<br />
As for the characters...<br />
Izumi, Eita:<br />
Nice character, I can relate to him a lot. The effort he puts in when helping out Natsume is incredible. Interesting that his future is kind of already planned, unlike the other characters.<br />
<br />
Natsume, Mio:<br />
Debatable here. A lot of people hate her, I understand that. Some of her actions were ridiculous and stupid but for me it got cancelled out when she realized her real feelings towards the end of the series. Very slow development but it was interesting to see her change bit by bit.<br />
<br />
Komiya, Ena:<br />
MVP. Does a lot for Izumi all the he way until the end. Direct and honest character who always knows what she&#039;s doing. Her determination to achieve her goals  is amazing, easily likable character. <br />
<br />
Soma, Haruto:<br />
Best friend of Izumi, he gives advice to Izumi and gets advice from him too. Their friendship is emphasized throughout the series, even if they didn&#039;t meet for quite some time. His face expressions were really funny.<br />
<br />
Morikawa, Hazuki:<br />
A character who cares a lot for her family and others&#039; feelings. The way she responded to Haruto towards the end was a bit odd for me but since it involved her future I guess it was the right choice. Liked the hairstyle change.<br />
<br />
A lot of the story was predictable, but I guess wanting more original ideas is a bit too much. I enjoyed a lot of Haruto&#039;s scenes because of his face expressions, and i also liked Komiya&#039;s efforts to get closer to Izumi. Overall, I was planning to give this a 8 but since it ended with my ship coming true I&#039;ll give an 9.<br />

    Short Answer: It was honestly average. The anime, overall, felt quite rushed. After completing it, I feel the same as I felt before. No change... I would recommend that you watch the anime if you have free time but don&#039;t expect a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
The story itself was basic and not very interesting. It was cliche and nothing new so I would rate it a 3. When I first watched it, I was confused. The story felt as though it could be summarised in one sentence.<br />
<br />
The art was great but there were some moments where it was mediocre, especially some of the running scenes. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266735">
        opening song: it was relaxing to listen to so that&#039;s one thing that&#039;s good about the show. The ending song was also decent.<br />
<br />
 The characters were all cliche. The &#039;quiet girl&#039;, the &#039;loud girl&#039;, the &#039;basic girl&#039;, the &#039;basic boy&#039; and the &#039;sports guy&#039;. <br />
<br />
I felt as though the anime was a waste of time so I didn&#039;t really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would rate this anime a 4. It was definitely not a masterpiece in my opinion but it was something at least...<br />

    This show requires at least two episodes to find if it&#039;s your flavor. Watch a third and you&#039;re in for the long run.<br />
<br />
StOrY 8/10<br />
The story is slow as first and moves similar to a train. Once you are at a cruise, you feel very comfortable. You watch the scenery just fly by while losing yourself in your own thoughts. After 3 episodes, you will find yourself thinking about what will happen with the love triangles, relationships, and school lives of the characters.<br />
<br />
ArT 7/10<br />
The artwork reminds me of certain old movies but it is very suitable for this kind of storytelling. Sometimes can convey a mood

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263121">
        of depression or just normalcy. As if nothing extraordinary is going to happen. I think it allows you to focus more on the emotions being laid out to the viewer. <br />
<br />
Oh and the lighting detail is very charming. I can&#039;t ignore that. I love the art.<br />
<br />
SoUnD 7/10<br />
I&#039;ll be honest, I was so engrossed in the visuals and story that I didn&#039;t notice the soundtrack. Some shows actually do a bad job with synchronizing what&#039;s happening or transitions in scenes. You won&#039;t experience that here. More often than not, there isn&#039;t any music. Just the natural environment. It does its job and that&#039;s what matters- to set the mood.<br />
<br />
ChArAcTeR 8/10<br />
The characters do seem boring or bland at first. But they all have somewhere they want to go and are hung up in some way with their own feelings and inexperience. Izumi might be the most interesting to watch because he doesn&#039;t say much but his actions do all the work. He&#039;s very likable. I feel like they could express themselves a little more but I&#039;m pretty satisfied with what I&#039;m getting.<br />
<br />
EnJoYmEnT 7/10<br />
It&#039;s a slice of life/romance. The comedy is scarce but the drama is ever building. I&#039;m 6 episodes in and the cliffhanger is REALLY good.. I&#039;m enjoying what I&#039;m seeing and I can&#039;t comment more on that. If you don&#039;t have patience, pass on this one.<br />
<br />
VeRdIcT 8/10<br />
<br />
The show isn&#039;t finished airing but going in with little expectation and knowing it was a slow show that requires two episodes to get into, I am very happy with what I&#039;ve seen so far. I&#039;m definitely looking forward to next week.<br />
<br />
Tip: Watch 3 episodes at a time if you can. ;]

    This one is my first review for an anime, but for me it is the most underrated anime i have seen in myal, its so simple that its great, the characters, the story development are both great!.<br />
It&#039;s an excellent anime overall, i can even identify myself in it being in high school, applying to college, studying and at the same time thinking about your friend and of course your love life, its a very difficult thing to do.<br />
liked the love triangles and the friendship between the main characters, It&#039;s probably one of the best slice of life anime I&#039;ve watched so far and definitely deserves

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354593">
        a 9/10!, i mean its not the best anime there is but it makes everything right, and it is so simple its great.<br />
<br />
The development of the many main characters, different points of view, they are all dealing with there own problems while at the same time trying to help each other out, also the love life of every one of them, the confessions, the misunderstandings, and it has that wholesome feeling at the ending which i really loved it.<br />
<br />
The rating of this anime is really not what it deserves, i really think people should give it a chance, i mean i just couldnt stop watching it from episode 3 and forward, probably the first 2 episodes where a little slow, but really it was worth it. I really think you should give it a try.

    Just Because!, and speaking of that, just because I gave this a 7 doesn&#039;t change my opinion on giving Tsuki ga Kirei a 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
I like to spoil things, making me a spoiler. <br />
<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to be brief for this review, and Just Because I&#039;m making it brief doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m lazy. It&#039;s mostly due to me being kind of late to this series and plus there are many other reviews already written about it. I must say, I enjoyed it more than I thought. While this show isn&#039;t as groundbreaking or as ambitious as other better anime turns out, it is still an enjoyable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338082">
        watch. The plot is somewhat recycled but the characters and the way the plots are carried out are interesting. I know a ton of people compare this to Tsuki ga Kirei and I can definitely see why. The way the romance is carried out is quite similar, with opposing characters to try to pose a challenge for our main lovebirds. But that compared to &#039;Just Because!&#039;? I think Just Because does a way better job on not just the story and the execution, but the characters, the humour and in almost everything. I must admit, I do wish the production of this show was better because the painful animation and art kill a ton of the emotions and mood of some scenes. It&#039;s a bummer but it&#039;s still way more bearable than Tsuki ga Kirei, gosh that shit is the epitome of zero production. Another thing I feel that the show does a poor job in is the sense of time, in scenes where there is a flashback or a forward/backwards in time, it&#039;s hard to tell and it leaves me the viewer slightly confuse. But other than those two, I say the rest is pretty decent, not fantastic but pleasing to watch.<br />
<br />
-SCORES-<br />

Character- 7/10: While there were many characters in the show, I feel that the writers did a good job of giving each one depth and interest. What I love most about the characters is how they are so relatable at times. For example, when my man Haruto gets somewhat rejected on Valentine&#039;s Day by Hazuki, definitely it was a big F for him but the way he turned it around and even cracked a laugh at it just struck me as an amazing thing. These are the kind of scenes that I truly love, it takes something bad and turns it around. This show does it a few times and I must compliment it for it. I also like how likeable all the characters are, they aren&#039;t anyone that is annoying or I hate. For example, Ena, while she does want Eita she knows her boundaries and respects his choice. The scenes where she just breaks down was... painful. But do you get where I&#039;m coming from, all the characters are likeable.<br />
<br />
Art- 6/10: One of the issues, I really wished it was better because it would just make up a ton of the enjoyment loss because of the low production this show have. Not the best but certainly not the worst.<br />
<br />
Writing- 7/10: There were some weird and stupid moments like the fact that Eita doesn&#039;t know how to change his wallpaper just boggles my mind, but I like to think that he wanted to keep Ena as his wallpaper. Sometimes the writing is bad like that but other times it&#039;s a massive W. An example when like I said before Haruto turns his situation around or when Mio still pursue her interest in Eita. It&#039;s moments like these that really push the show forward. Still though, when Eita failed the exam for a less prestigious school, apart of me was like &#039;Bruh&#039; but the rest was like &#039;I&#039;m a loser baby, so why don&#039;t you kill me&#039; -Beck. <br />
<br />
Sound- 7/10: I say it did its job, some scenes are exceptions. The intro and outro didn&#039;t strike me much but it&#039;s listenable. <br />
<br />
Overall, great watch to binge on if you aren&#039;t looking for a high expectation romance show. Like, come on, this is way better than Tsuki ga Kirei, that shit had no depth to it. Characters were out of words to say for the majority of their screentime, still can&#039;t believe that that got higher than Just Because! <br />

    The plot, in my opinion, had great potential, BUT it went really bad. <br />
I liked the fact that main character was obsessed with his past and his love. But in the meanwhile Komiya did everything for Eita, but this moron threw everything away from the window and trated her like a trash as she was not really important. to be honest i really could accept it, but the final was so forced i could not apprecciate at all.<br />
<br />
I liked every other characters except for Eita, so dumbass.<br />
<br />
By the way music, opening, were really cool and nice to hear.<br />
<br />
Same about the art. Really good for eyes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318210">
        to see those drawings, nothing to say about them. Nice animations and nice particulars.<br />
<br />
Another thing i really liked it was the storytelling and the atmosphere created. Really good and well done. But with that forced final it was so wasted.
