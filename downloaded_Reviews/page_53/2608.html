    From the depths of fanservicy guilty pleasure of hell makes the return of High School DxD Hero. It’s been nearly 3 years since the last time this anime aired on TV and to be honest, it needed a break after the disastrous third season. High School DxD Born left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing how far the franchise has fallen. Is Hero a chance for the show to redeem itself?<br />
<br />
The fourth season covers the volume 9 and 10 from the light novels. This didn’t come as a surprise as the franchise has a tendency to build more into the story with established

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282868">
        concepts. To say the least, the franchise isn’t afraid of taking the risk to show off its fan service. Straight from the first episodes, we see the characters return with Issei still being a perverted self-proclaimed “Harem King”. It doesn’t take long for the plot to kick off after they visit Kyoto where a new story puts him in conflict with supernatural entities yet again. <br />
<br />
Following a formulaic construction of the plot, the first half of the show adapts the 9th volume. We meet a fox girl named Kunou and after a misunderstanding, she pleads for Issei and the others to save her mother. The premise of this arc is incredibly straightforward after Issei realizes the responsibility they need to carry to get the job done. However, the arc is perhaps a bit too predictable and lacks the High School DxD-esque quality as the first two seasons. In other words, I must admit that a few of the first few episodes are too forced. The drama is too serious and didn’t make me care about Kunou as much as I had hoped for. On the other hand, there are still remnants of fun value we can see this season. The fan service returns thanks to the naïve personalities of characters like Xenovia and Irina. Even though Rias and the main cast aren’t there, Issei still gets a face of boobs, ass, and skinship. I say this with honesty that High School DxD is one of the few anime that works creatively well with the fanservice. Without it, the show would lose its identity. Luckily, the show does manage to find its way to bring that out again.<br />
<br />
Covering the 10th volume, this fourth season manages to find itself well on the path of its roots again. By the time you’ve reached over the half the series, the familiar mood will return almost like yesterday.  It also does a clever job at building up the inevitable battles as Ria’s Team goes up against Sairaorg Bael’s peerage. Remember, this franchise began with a concept known a “Rating Games” that has been a central element in the storytelling. This time, the stakes are more about pride to see which team is better. For Issei himself, there’s also some emotional stakes that he didn’t even realize himself. The fact that after three seasons, he’s still dense as a black hole should come as no surprise to viewers. In one particular episode, Rias directly confronts him about her feelings and we get a half-assed response from the guy. This may rub viewers in the wrong way as the relationship between Issei and Rias has been a central focus in the franchise. <br />
<br />
The Rating Game itself also featured some comedic moments with the press conference buildup and the actual execution. There’s also some exploitation about the rules of the game to get viewers familiarized again. The actual battles felt more or less like a cheesy mix of underwhelming fighting. In fact, I would say most of them are insignificant that even includes Issei’s in the first rounds. The show only has 12 episodes so it limited itself from achieving full potential. To me, that’s a backstabber to fans of the franchise who wants to get the most from the action. Honestly, I think High School DxD’s action elements has always been one of its weaknesses and from season 4, that didn’t change much either. In some of the final few episodes, business picks up more as Issei confronts Sairaorg himself as we see how dangerous his rival really is.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest changes of High School DxD Hero is the art style. The first three seasons were adapted by studio TNK that fans are familiar with. However, Passione takes the step this time to animate the project. They are perhaps best known for their work on Rokka no Yuuska and more recently, Citrus. I’m not going to lie, it’s going to take some time to get comfortable with it. The character models looks less detailed and cartoonier especially for the main girls. Don’t get me wrong though. Characters like Rias and Akeno still looks busty like the previous seasons. Even new characters like Yasaka gives the impression of a sexy older type. However, it will take time to get used to the new art style as there’s less details on the fan service. It’s still there especially if you watch the uncensored version with the boobs and ass being thrown at your face. The action still feels the same as the previous seasons though so don’t expect anything that will blow you out the water. Character designs in terms of plot direction improved slightly with an improved transformation of Issei. Similarly, character voice mannerism somewhat evolves this season that’s more noticeable in Rias and Issei. She is able to display her personality at best when together with Issei especially during some of their more emotional scenes. The theme songs still feature a mix of action and fanservice theatrics I’m sure fans are familiar with. <br />
<br />
Well it’s been nearly three years since I’ve reviewed High School DxD. After the break, I think this show manages to step up slightly up to the plate. However, it’s not a big improvement over the third season and more like a step down compared to the first two. The plot is both easy to predict but hard to recall memorable moments from especially in its first episodes. It tests the viewers’ patience for its main character cast especially with Issei’s role. I also have to say honestly that Issei deserved a personal beating from the way he responded to Rias in that one particular episode. Otherwise, I think the fourth season is still worth the watch especially if you’re a diehard fan of the franchise. High School DxD always felt like it’s about having fun with itself. In this season, there’s still moments that manages to find its way towards that.

    Highschool DxD&#039;s 4th Season ended with a promo for the next season? Well! Only time will tell that possibility!<br />
<br />
Now... for my review.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
Most of the fans really liked the previous art where the TNK is the one who made that! I also liked that art style of TNK but there is some flaws of it. Like the animation for the fights in the previous seasons, Some of those fight scenes were like a GIF or something like those old anime fight scenes. The thing that I like in TNK&#039;s were the character design, They are absolutely stunning!<br />
<br />
Now for the Passione, since they are the one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282956">
        who are doing this fourth season, I know there are some of you who has a struggle getting used to the art style but try looking at the bright side of it.<br />
<br />
I will tell you the some good sides of this change:<br />
Character Design: They&#039;re using the current character design of the Light Novel. They are really cute for me! Getting used to it will take some time but I assure you they have the reason for this change.<br />
<br />
Animation: The animation for this season is top notch compared to the previous ones, Just compare the fight scenes of this one to the previous one, Look how amazing the animation of this season! Also the Ecchi scenes are so fluid this time! Stiffness of the Previous is now gone.<br />
Old is &quot;Gold&quot; but evolution will not take place without &quot;Change&quot;.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
I know the focus of this series is Issei but did you notice that some of the characters in the shadow in the previous seasons is now on the spotlight! The relationships of this season will shock you and also a stepping stone for our harem king?! Maybe? That&#039;s for you to find out!<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
I have simple reason for this. The sound and OST were the same of the Previous Seasons with some new ones but to hear the classics again is priceless! Also, The Opening were catchy and I fell in love in the Ending Song.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
I love how they pour some of their budget just to retcon the abomination of Season 3, Really... You will never see an Animation Studio like that everyday, An Animation Studio that will make an EFFORT to make other studio&#039;s mistake straight again. So... I would like to rate Passione&#039;s EFFORT 10/10!<br />
<br />
Now, They are following the Vol. 9&amp;10 of the LN but some of the abomination of S3 is making an effect this season so some things will also a little bit confusing for those anime-only. That&#039;s why I rate the story 9/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
The humor of this anime will be the same for me even though they changed the studio, nothing beats the humor it gives for me! It maybe sounded a little bit biased on my side but that&#039;s how I felt while watching this season. so I&#039;m being honest here. :)<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
I&#039;ve watched countless Action/Ecchi/Harem/Romance animes out there but this one is one of the best for me! The girls of this series were just perfect, Hyoudou Issei is like a dense type MC of a Harem series but he has reasons for it, Unlike those other MCs that are so dense af out of nowhere. High School DxD is the type of an Ecchi/Harem series that has both &quot;Plot&quot; and Plot.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s my review for this season! If you are planning to watch this series then go for it! I highly recommended this anime!<br />
<br />
I CLAIM IT! SEE YOU AGAIN IN THE NEXT SEASON OPPAI DRAGON!!!

    Boobies<br />
<br />
Sweet, now I got your attention. <br />
<br />
All right, if you are into High School DxD, you’re gonna like this. If you are not, then why are you still here? If you haven’t seen it, then go watch the other seasons first, otherwise you’re going to be clueless. <br />
<br />
In fact, for those who have mostly forgotten, I’ll give a 4-sentence summary of what previously happened(Then I&#039;ll immediately get into the review.):<br />
<br />
Issei has the Sacred Gear of Red Dragon Emperor DDraig. He has become a demon of the Gremory Household, most of which consists of girls who are attracted to him. Already he’s gone up against numerous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282864">
        villains, having his powers developed to the point of many different abilities, including control of a mecha suit. (Juggernaut being the unstable but powerful version, as can be seen in the recent special “Taiikukan-ura no Holy”.) <br />
<br />
(Characters)<br />
To be honest, I’m not surprised the girls are into Issei. He’s got a heart of gold, is loyal, brave and goofy. And a bumbling pervert. Which is fitting for a series this fond of boobs. (Also makes for a funny character flaw.) All of the girls have felt empowered by him at some point in previous seasons, and personally, I kinda like him too. Although, I have to admit that their attraction to him sometimes gets turned up to near-absurd levels you only see in ecchi harems. Whether that’s a bad thing or not depends on you and how you interpret the Rule of Sexy (“It doesn’t really have to make sense as long as it is sexy.”). <br />
<br />
Since most of the character development has been done in previous seasons, they don’t really get much in Hero. They are still the same however, as they should. Issei is still lewd but nice, Asia is still cutesy, Akeno is still teasing, Koneko is still kuudere and Rias is still Rias. As for the minor characters, there are only a few who are getting considerable screentime. One of them being Rossweisse, since she’s relatively new here. Then there are the antagonists, one of them stemming from the clusterfuck that is the Khaos Brigade and who is underdeveloped. The other one is Sairaorg Bael, who is pretty cool, being someone without powers becoming strong by training and who feels the need to prove himself because of this, and whose character is pulled off well enough. Anytime when the characters do get fleshed out a little it can make for endearing moments, which is probably one of the reasons people like the series. <br />
<br />
(Animation)<br />
Now, the biggest concern that I have heard from those who are into DxD, is that the animation has changed. Particularly the character designs, which have been simplified. Since apparently BorN wasn’t quite the success, the series has gone from TNK to relatively new studio Passione, who then used an artstyle of their own. Some people may have found the design change difficult to accept. <br />
<br />
However, simplifying the design has somewhat worked in the shows favour. By doing this, it has become easier to animate, and it gives the characters a softer look. (Being a fanservice show, having them look softer… might definitely work in favour of the show. The women are also quite voluptuous.) On top of that, it manages to blend in nicely with the general atmosphere and style of the show. <br />
<br />
On the other side, it doesn&#039;t have great animation per se. While it does look fine overall, with bright colours and decent fights, occasionally there are small issues like characters without shadows, awkward walking animation or facial expressions or something that just doesn’t look that smooth. It can be distracting, but it doesn’t necessarily have a large effect on the overall quality, since most of the parts that need to look good, look good. So yeah, mostly some fights and fanservice. <br />
<br />
(Story)<br />
Quick summary: “Issei and some of the characters go on a Kyoto school trip, and there are a bunch of fox-youkai over there. Something is going on with that.”<br />
<br />
Two episodes in, and I began to see that it was fast-paced as heck. There can be little time to breath in between scenes, and sometimes I would forget what just happened. However, the story isn’t that complex, so it’s not too hard to follow. As usual with DxD, the story isn’t anything impressive, but still just engaging enough to keep you watching and when combined with the characters, it actually makes you care. <br />
<br />
(Sound)<br />
Ok, so DxD still has a soundtrack that fits with its style. This being the nice beats and bittersweet melodies. When this music gets played under a scene, it tends to fit the tone and not be overshadowing anything, while being turned up a notch when the moment calls for it. The OP and ED songs are nothing special really, although the ED has some memorable visuals. Not to say that these are bad, since they are pleasant to listen to. As for the voice acting, the people are just doing their job and are doing it well. <br />
<br />
(Enjoyment/Overall)<br />
The series manages to do what sold it in the first place. For most of us, this would not only be the sexy fanservice, but also at least two or three likeable characters and an even more likeable protagonist, a story that manages to be engaging, and just overall decent animation and soundtrack. High School DxD is kinda silly, but knows what it is and has a lot of charm. This season itself is not necessarily better than previous seasons, but not much worse either. For most of the time, while it had some small issues, it was entertaining. And finally, that is what counts the most. <br />

    hey readers <br />
here&#039;s my review of anime adaptation of wonderful light novel series i try to keep my review very straightforward and short covering only reason why you should give this show a try and why this season is much better than previous season&#039;s which is ruining the adaptation by only focusing on fan service and other mainstream shits rather than story<br />
<br />
story:(9/10)<br />
dxd 4th season is adaptation of 9th volume of dxd LN Pandemonium at the School Trip <br />
It has a nice plot and great characters that will attract you with their unique personalities its a wonderful story with wide no of different characters, setups and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280200">
        location combining large no. of mythical figures and legends such as angel demons gods of different mythology and legends dragon youkai etc and concept like apocalypse infinity dream creation etc in an awesome way .. its universe is probably you can say most vibrant and large as compare to any anime<br />
The ecchi scenes are hilarious. Some people say that the ecchi is exaggerated especially the idea of Issei being a pervert but as you watch the anime you will find that he is a great boy and usually tries his best to control his desires with girls (but he fails numerous times).Note that there are many animes that have more sexual scenes than it with a very weak plot ,so this anime does his job really very well<br />
<br />
characters:(9/10)<br />
You are familiar&#039;s with most of the characters as it is fourth season there are lot more romantic development lot&#039;s of new character&#039;s are introduced and there is lot of focus on issei&#039;s relationship with rias. As for Issei he goes from being an overly-perverted MC to a perverse, respected, beloved, mature and powerful MC who gives his all to protect his comrades and truly cares about all of them deepening his relationship with every one and forming new allies and also about ANTAGONIST introduced especially in this volume is diverse as the protagonists and several of them are antagonists you just love to hate them<br />
<br />
about Issei&#039;s harem (∞/whats so ever...XD)<br />
Ise&#039;s harem is handled in such a wonderful way.every one is dynamic and got there own speciallity There&#039;s no crazy tsundere beatings or normal harem antics, just friendly competition amongst the girls for their spot in the harem. All the girls are just perfect. Every single one of them is so unique and they all play a huge role of importance in the series.<br />
<br />
animation(7/10) and art(8/10) or youtube trailer..:P<br />
well its kind of decent animation i would not say its great like those of kyoto animtion or ufotable but its better than before as it shows light novel content perfectly so put it simply you get what you expected<br />
<br />
enjoyment:(8/10)<br />
It&#039;s hilarious, it&#039;s unpredictable, it&#039;s extremely intense, all the characters are fantastic, the ecchi and romance are wonderful <br />
you will enjoy all the characters especially ANTAGONIST as they are not just mindless freaks and got complex characteristics action is intense along with awesome fan service..:D<br />
<br />
overall(why you should watch it)(8/10)<br />
Highschool DxD is in no way your ordinary ecchi series plot is brilliant with intense characters and astounding plot preserving story along with super power and harem echhi stuff which is quite rare. its really a good and refreshing show <br />
<br />
Overall Grade:	8<br />
Story	9<br />
Animation	7<br />
Sound	8<br />
Character	9<br />
Enjoyment	8

    As you all know just by the cover alone this is full of so much &quot;fan service&quot; it could write a book has every style of character from the provocative to the shy and every type between. As a story goes it has one that plays out in often times extremely comedic fashion enough to make me laugh with its wit and sometimes satistic manner. Yes it&#039;s full of lots of Opai of all sizes but mostly more on the curvatishios the animation and character design are well done and fit their character types some with more underlying hidden aspects then what is outrightly perceived.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282949">
        back story is well put together with enough depth to give the world a semblance of life in an occult fashion. While the anime leads itself to a fixed track often seen in hermes it borrows from others such as a hero growing in power giving it a bit of play where there are love triangles it becomes more of a romance between two with supporting characters who try to show their best to win out. Attitudes change characters evolve and we gain a good sense of progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I love the show it&#039;s a great show for anyone who loves ecchi with a bit more depth then just fighting for the sake of making your opponents cloths fall off yet your skin never more then dirty (unless you are a male character then you contain enough blood to fill a swimming pool) a standard theme in any fighting ecchi.<br />
If you have the time it&#039;s a great binge watch and fully uncensored only makes it more funny at times then odd attempts like smoke, hair that magically covers everything

    [Prologue]<br />
<br />
I love High School DXD. It is easily one of my favorite anime franchises and has consistently been a good watch. Unfortunately, this is not the case for High School DXD Hero. After three years of waiting, I daresay that it would have been better for the series to have stayed dead. That&#039;s how bad it is.<br />
<br />
[&quot;Too late. 3 years too late.&quot;]<br />
<br />
First of all, let&#039;s discuss the smaller elephant in the room. This sequel took 3 years to be aired. I&#039;m well aware of the complications that occurred during its production. Transferring a popular franchise to another studio must be a lot of work. Unfortunately,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309980">
        I, as a viewer, do not care WHY my long-awaited anime is trash. I only care that it IS trash. Oh yeah, did I tell mention that this season is TRASH?<br />
<br />
[The bigger elephant]<br />
<br />
The artstyle change was jarring to say the least. The fans all collectively prayed to Michael-sama asking that he forgive the studio. They probably thought: &quot;Hey, maybe they softened up the coloring to make the animation more fluid or something.&quot; Nope. Not the case. I cannot get over how bad the art is this season. The models are off. The characters look ugly. Hell, sometimes it looks like they didn&#039;t even try. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s use a screenshot for reference. You, reader, go to 4:14 in Episode 8 and tell me what is wrong with that image. For those of you who are too lazy to do so, I&#039;ll tell you. Issei isn&#039;t even looking at the character who he&#039;s supposed to be looking at. In fact, he isn&#039;t looking at anything. This is absolutely pathetic- and no- it isn&#039;t a one-off occurrence. This type of shit happens all throughout this season. How does a show come out looking this rushed after 3 years of waiting?<br />
<br />
[Why? Fucking why?]<br />
<br />
Why did this season turn out so shitty? Why did it take three years? Why did the studio bother releasing this trash? Well, I can answer all of these questions as I have before. The anime community is shit. Everyone here is willing to accept whatever is put in front of them citing &quot;exclusivity&quot; as an excuse for their undying support. It&#039;s like paying to eat trash because food is scarce- but the food isn&#039;t scarce, you just couldn&#039;t be fucked to ask for it. Consumers should demand quality from the producers. Obviously, these studios only care about money- that&#039;s why this shoddily-assembled piece of filth was released. That&#039;s also why you NEED to demand more from studios. Shows that notoriously don&#039;t have a 2nd season will likely suffer the same fate as this show. As the studio executives hear fans desperately crying for ANYTHING to be released as a sequel, what are they to do but take those idiots up on the offer? <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t stand that this show has a 7.49 rating. &quot;Hey, boss, these idiots took the bait!&quot;. Yeah, this community did take the bait. Fuck it all, man.

    Repost: OPPAI<br />
<br />
 Another HSDXD Sequel has ended last year ago and it seems that  funaimation decide to put up another  sequel l has taken 4 steps backward? Now, ok , this sequel has a different studio and it&#039;s under studio Passione, it may have a new character designer but the thing about this sequel was instead of moving forward with Issei&#039;s relationship with Rias, it rather took a couple of steps backward. Also the relationship of the guy&#039;s harem has taken a new twist were the harem itself no longer competes for the guys affection.The only thing that hasn&#039;t change was the guy&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320646">
        &quot;OPPAI&quot; rant, that was rather annoying that there isn&#039;t an episode where you won&#039;t hear the word &quot;OPPAI&quot; and what&#039;s worst was they even added child porn in it by doing a children&#039;s song about, you&#039;ve guess it &quot;OPPAI&quot;. The addition of a loli Ravel only adds to this anime&#039;s child porn shit, the story may have been different but then again, it was still the usual when we have Issei being this &quot;OPPAI&quot; Dragon was at first up against Cao cao and his posses and the later Sairaog who was just picking a fight and as usual it&#039;s up to Rias&#039; posses to deal with them just like in season 1, in fact it was more like a repeat of season 1  which I have to say the season 3&#039;s story plot was much better than this sequel . On the fanservices, nothing has change there is the usual panty service , boob service , swimsuit service and the usual onsen service, so frankly this sequel was still the same shit but different illustration so here were my ratings:<br />
<br />
Story- Poor 3: Basically the story plot was almost like that of one part from season 1 to one part of season 3, where this sequel has become bad to worse.<br />
<br />
Art-Mediocre 5 : Cu&#039;z despite of having a different illustrator, the usual fanservices where still there, and by this time one would have been watching the uncensored version, and at the same time  hounds would be going bananas over it.  <br />
<br />
Sound- Very Good 8: That was for the opening theme where it really does fit one element of this story plot &quot;SWITCH ON, SWIIITCH OOOOON!&quot;<br />
<br />
Character- Pathetic 1: Since Issei&#039;s relationship with Rias has taken a couple of steps backwards and he&#039;s no longer this harem king wanna be despite of those girls throwing themselves on him in their birthday suits.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Dreadful 2: I feel like that I wanna go there in Japan look for the people who made this sequel and give them a BOOOSTOOOOO amount of whooping in their asses.<br />
<br />
Overall-Pathetic 1: Well by the looks of it another sequel will be in the making when we see Azazel having a secret, that he doesn&#039;t tell Rias and her lackeys. So the question is &quot;When?&quot;<br />
<br />

    Well this is a genuine surprise. I was so thoroughly disappointed by Born that I almost didn&#039;t even bother with Hero, and the new art style/character redesigns brought me right to the edge of abandoning ship five minutes into the first episode. But I endured, and I haven&#039;t been so glad of anything since I realized I can take concubines in CK2.<br />
<br />
This art style suits the concept of DxD way better than the old one, although it took getting used to. Rounding of faces and the drastic increase in boob sizes are obvious changes right out of the gate, but improvements in movement frames, character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302998">
        expressions, and increase in color contrast make it a much richer experience. Switching studios really allowed this series to turn 360 degrees and walk away from the total shitshow that was Born.<br />
<br />
Besides mammoth expansion of honkers, Issei&#039;s growth as the Titdragon melds well with better jokes and more interesting characters, as well as taking the narrative away from a &quot;big bad evil&quot; and refocusing on a tighter problem to solve. A friendly rating game was the perfect solution to the lame &quot;Chaos Brigade,&quot; because not only was that a totally stupid antagonist it was also boring af to watch. &quot;Oh my god dude look it&#039;s Loki I wonder if he&#039;s going to be a tricky trickster wow look at that he did a tricky thing ha ha I&#039;m so fooled by the trick there&quot; versus &quot;a friendly fight with a guy who can punch holes in reality by sheer willpower and is a legitimate bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a full-spectrum anime with true depth of character. I am so pleased with the reversal from S3 and I absolutely cannot wait until S5. Do recommend without reservation.

    What&#039;s with the high rating here? This series has clearly fallen from its predecessors. <br />
Issei still happens to be that &quot;rash&quot; MC which I&#039;ve come to be annoyed by. If anything happens to his friends no matter how trivial, especially matters of the sexual-related sort, sends him off into a flying rage. Because, this happens to be his two states - &quot;Oppai&quot; or a &quot; crazy-angry&quot; nutter. Moreover, whenever he&#039;s bombarded with these &quot;oppai&quot; the other female characters undress and jump after him. These scenes used to be funny - not anymore. The charm and the reason I enjoy the ecchi genre is because of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282371">
        the rarity and sex appeal, however, situations like these happen so frequently its irritating. Some of their internal problems happen to be extremely stupid and dragged on(MINOR SPOILERS FROM S2/S3)- like the one where Rias wants Issei to call her by her first name, this has been going on since around season 2. Get with it! But the most irritating thing here is the cringe, the stupid expression on Issei&#039;s face when he sees a women&#039;s breast or when the characters get some armour or something of the sort - proof that the animators are focusing on making it cool rather than focusing on the overall picture because apparently to the marketing department the audience happens to be a bunch of high-libido 11-13 year old who like to see something cool and want to see a screen full of boobs, right?<br />

I&#039;d rather give it 5 out of 10 but Akeno and Koneko happen to be my favourites so I&#039;ll give it a 6. This is just for S4 but seeing the series overall, and harem being one of my favourite genres, I&#039;ve seen way, way better harem animes that this one. <br />

    Note: I watched this series in the English dub, I have read the light novels, and I’m taking episode 0 into consideration for this review.<br />
<br />
Coming off the back of a 3 year break from the disastrous butchering that forced the author to retcon the events of S3 in his DxD DX series, High School DxD Hero is the fourth continuation of the light novel series. DxD is regarded as one of the best ecchi series out there with its raunchy ecchi scenes, great cast of characters and their dynamics, very good storytelling and worldbuilding to compliment it. Taking the helm of the anime’s production is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351572">
        a relatively new studio called Passione, and that means a new director, new music, and most noticeably, a new character designer. Just how well did they faithfully adapt the series?<br />
<br />
Before the season started, a special that aired as season four’s episode 0, for a very important reason. In the third season of DxD, TNK decided to make several altercations to the story and the order of its events and the novels themselves. The order of the novels that were adapted were 5--&gt;7--&gt;6, and what’s worse is that they tried to fit all three of those volumes into just 12 episodes, cutting a lot of content, character development and dialogue, and some important fights, narratively speaking. This episode acted as a tool to retcon the final four episodes in order to put the series’ narrative back on the right path for future adaptations, as the what the final 4 episodes could have done is put the series on an entirely different path. As a fan of the novels, I was very pleased to see the new studio fixed up the mess of the previous’, probably at the request of the author himself. Although this was fixed and follows the novels really closely, there was a lot of relevant information that was never adapted which played into this season, with the events being mentioned a few times (like the Sitri vs Gremory rematch or Beelzebub improving Issei’s evil pieces). To fully experience the series and to actually understand what went on, I implore you to read volumes 5, 6 &amp; 7, they’ll definitely be worth your time if you’re interested in the series and its story (which is great btw).<br />
<br />
DxD Hero aired right after episode 0, which the series adapted volumes 9 and 10 of the light novel series, which splits the season into two, having 6 episodes to focus on each event. Volume 9 focuses on the trip to Kyoto and the fight against the Hero Faction. When Issei arrives at Kyoto, he and his friends get into a fight against Kunou in what is a misunderstanding. They then run into the Hero Faction, who are plotting to summon Great Red. This fight and victory against the Hero Faction gave them the opportunity to form an alliance with the youkai. Featuring the youkai adds a lot of depth into the series’ worldbuilding since there are many different mythologies that are featured within this story, it’s unique in its attempt to feature western and Japanese religion and mythology as a plot point, as it’s hardly been done before in any medium. Although the plotline and objectives are easy to follow, it’s still enjoyable to be able to see the events unfold and lead into the next part of this season.<br />
<br />
Volume 10 takes up the second half of Hero, which entails the rating game battle between Rias and Sairaorg’s groups. Rating games are an essential part of devil culture in this franchise, as it can determine status, power, and wealth within their society, and it’s a great way for the author to pit characters against each other in different battles with specific sets of rules in place. The fight between Rias and Sairaorg is also where this season shines. The highpoint of this series is the final battle between Issei and Sairaorg where emotions ran high and as both of the character evolve throughout the fight, leveling up to more extreme levels of strength. And of course, after a long wait of four seasons, we finally get to see Issei confront his feelings and confess his love to Rias, which I think many shippers would have enjoyed dearly. Both volumes are loaded with info, and that made the speed of the show very fast, it flew through a lot of content in a short amount of time. If it were me, I would’ve spent an extra episode or two, maybe for each novel, to slow things down in order to get used to and flesh out the newly introduced characters and for more time to develop the story. But that’s the cost of only being 12 episodes long.<br />
<br />
This might be an issue with the previous three seasons as this season felt different compared to them, but this season was actually able to capture the essence and feelings of the novels better than seasons 1-3. Passione was actually able to present the turmoil and PTSD that affects Issei since his death at the hands of Raynare, unlike TNK. In the anime, it may seem like Issei takes too long to decide on what to do, and to go for the move, which might seem typical of a male harem protagonist. But what Issei was actually feeling was fear and regret, being afraid of being harmed again or having the situation backfire. Unless you’ve read the novels, it’s nearly impossible to figure out that Issei was still strongly affected by the events of season 1. You might complain about how this season doesn’t feel like true High School DxD, but I think the first 3 seasons weren’t true to the novels to begin with. Maybe it has to do with how the series was written which may be hard to translate fully into motion picture, but this season was able to hit the mark in its faithfulness to the source material, and I’m overall impressed and pleased with the results. <br />
<br />
One of the most noticeable changes, and most argued among many fans of this series, is the change in art style. When TNK fucked up and the author got mad, he changed studios in preparation for the next season of DxD, and with that change in studio comes a change in personnel, like director, animators, and character designer. Whilst I liked the old style, and I will miss it a lot, due to the fuckup of S3, we need to accept the changes and move on. What I liked with the change in art is the background designs, as I think they are a million times more visually pleasing and aesthetic than before. A lot of attention to detail is put into the details of drawings, be it of the cities (like Kyoto) or somewhere naturey (the scene with Azazel and Sairaorg after the game), I found them to be a great upgrade to the visual aspect of the series (they make the series brighter and pop out of the screen more). <br />
<br />
One of the more important changes is with the character designs since the characters look less sharp and more rounded. What I think the character designer was trying to achieve was to match the designs in the novels and their covers as closely as he can, and I think he did quite well, and I quite like the changes. Even if the faces looks kinda fat around the cheek areas and hair not being as sharp as they originally were, this is one of the changes that’ll stay around for a very long time, so it’ll take a while before mostly everyone including myself will get used to them. The females still look as busty and sexy as they did before, so I’m pleased they didn’t do anything to the aspect that makes the series as popular as it is now.<br />
<br />
The animation in this series isn’t known to be all that good, as it’s often janky and gif-like. Though that couldn’t be said the same about Hero. This season’s animation is a big upgrade, it’s actually decent compared to an average show. Passione put in the effort to make the fights seem more explosive and flamboyant with more frames per second to make the characters’ movements more dynamic and flexible. Since the character designs are easier to draw, the animators were able to do more with what they have at their disposal and focus more on the fights, which are a big aspect of this series. Overall, the fluidity of the animation and character movements were good.<br />
<br />
Characters are an integral part of this series, as it follows Issei’s journey to becoming a high-ranking devil and the harem king. Even as we’re 4 seasons in, this series continues to churn out new and unique characters from newly revealed factions and mythologies. This series also focuses on the development of Issei resolve and his relationship with Rias. The new characters features the likes of Sairaorg’s team, Kunou and her mother, the Hero Faction, Hades, dragons and dragon kings, the rating game champion, Rosenkreutz, and many more. These characters all have different personalities and powers, so it’s always interesting to see how they interact with each other and with Issei and the others.<br />
<br />
This season also focuses on the growth of Issei and his relationship with Rias. Since the beginning of the series, Issei has been scarred by the memories of his death at the hands of Raynare, which made him hesitant in most romantic or perverted situation he’s thrusted in. This made quite a few fans complain about him being a pussy for not being able to take advantage of the situation he’s in, or for being as thick as lead, but Issei suffering from his PTSD is overlooked by most anime-only fans since it wasn’t really touched on at all throughout the first three seasons. How many of you knew from the get-go that Issei was suffering from PTSD and that he refrained himself in most sexual situations because of his fear of being betrayed or rejected? It’s only thanks to the efforts of the other girls who reassured Issei that something similar to Raynare will never happen to him again and that they all love him that Issei is able to finally overcome is fears and find it in himself to confess to Rias. I don’t think the previous seasons of the anime gives that fact justice, so I think Passione did a great job of stating the fact of Issei having PTSD (before he got over it), even without having used too much of Issei’s inner monologue and thoughts.<br />
<br />
The music made the show more dramatic than what I thought it would be, though I have no complaints on that since this is a different outlook on the novels compared to TNK. The music fits quite well with the romance/ecchi scenes, the really deep and emotional moments, and the fights between characters and their hyped up moments. I enjoyed the disco/techno themed OP, but I don’t have anything to say about the ED except for it’s sexy visuals. Overall, I think the music did its job well.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this season a lot. As I’m still disappointed about last season’s butchering, as a light novel fan, this a really good adaptation of the story, probably on par as my favorite season alongside seasons 1&amp;2. I watched this in the English dub, and I can say for sure that this series’ comedy gets amplified from a 50 to 1000 thanks to the scriptwriters of the dub. This is a well-crafted and top-tier dub that most people can thoroughly enjoy watching, as the jokes and witty one-liners translate and suits this series really well, and I think this dub trumps the previous three seasons’. <br />
<br />
You might be hesitant of the changes in the art style since the studio who’s now making this show has changed, but don’t let that deter you from experience what the novels are truly about. You might find the ecchi nice to see, or the story fascinating and intriguing (though that’s probably ruined because of season 3), or you might find the English dub a blast to watch. Whatever the case is, if you like this series or ecchi and harem shows in general because you’re a degenerate like myself, then you’ll definitely enjoy this season. Now it’s hopeful wishing for season 5 to come out soon rather than never (as volumes 11 and 12 are the best in the series).<br />
<br />
Overall score: 8/10<br />

    I loved this season new art style but got use to it I&#039;ll miss the old style but anyways in opinion this is my 2nd favorite season good story and the sound on this was good as well it&#039;s clear my enjoyment on this season was a 10 man the last episode made me so emotional but i was mainly happy it looks like Rias&#039;s and Issei&#039;s relationship&#039;s began to progress near the end of this season and if you saw what was after the credits it&#039;s very likely a 5th season is coming if your a big fan like me your hyped as well.

    I watched High School DxD Hero expecting to get the same kind of funny perverted comedy and sexy characters from the previous 3 seasons but I was sadly disappointed, this is a review from someone who owns Seasons 1-3 on Limited Edition from Funimation and really enjoyed this show. <br />
<br />
It turns out that for Season 4 (Hero) the creator of High School DxD changed the studio that worked on the anime from Studio TNK (the one that did seasons 1-3) to a new studio named Passione because studio TNK changed the ending of Season 3 without the creators permission which led to the creator switching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283338">
        to a new studio for season 4.<br />
<br />
The change is studio is very apparent in the art style, animation quality, and scenes for the new anime, and it honestly doesnt feel like im watching the same anime that I grew to love over the previous 3 seasons. Some of the differences from the previous 3 seasons are<br />
<br />
1) The characters look different for example they have a little bump around their triangle shaped chins in some scenes that makes the chin look crooked, the shadowing on the characters faces looks different too, the scene where Rias was naked in bed in the end of episode 1 next to Issei her leg looked huge from the side view. <br />
<br />
2) In some scenes the detail on the characters is so bad that it looks like a little kid drew them.<br />
<br />
3) Issei is made to act more like a cartoon character in season 4 by puffing out smoke from his nose when he gets aroused, getting more nose bleeds, and making goofy perverted faces when hes aroused which makes him seem like a much less of a heroic character with epic dragon armor and more of a goofy pervert who got into a very lucky harem position.<br />
<br />
4) They keep introducing new villains in each episode and then talking about &quot;past fights&quot; they had with Issei but their completely new characters that were not shown in seasons 1-3, they should introduce the characters properly instead of trying to cut corners and reference fights that never happened in the previous seasons of the anime or at least werent shown in the anime version of the show (without reading the light novels or manga). <br />
<br />
5) The intro and outro videos arent as epic or sexy as in seasons 1-3, they seem more generic. <br />
<br />
Honestly it feels like im watching a completely different anime instead of the High School DxD I grew to love over Seasons 1-3, I own the Limited Edition Funimation releases for the previous 3 seasons but im not sure if I will buy Season 4 or not, I wish they would have kept the same studio that made the previous 3 seasons. It feels like when you follow a show for a long time and grow to love the characters then the next season comes and you find out that the Director changed some of the actors who you grew to love for people that look similar to them in the hopes that the viewer wouldnt notice the difference in actors and keep watching the series, well High School DxD the fans have noticed and we&#039;re not happy.

    If you liked the &quot;key&quot; parts of the last 3 seasons,<br />
     -Boobs<br />
     -panties<br />
     -peeping<br />
     -boobs<br />
     -music<br />
     - p l o t<br />
Then you will most likely enjoy this season tooo<br />
     The art is fantastic, as well as the music, and it follows up on the last 3 seasons stories, and just watching the MC (Issei) grow stronger and overcome his problems feels nice. Im also mad the he gets all the women and i cant get even one.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281688">
        if you can overcome the temptation to just stare at [certain] places, this series is truly enjoyable, and its full of comedy. in case youre a perv who really likes bobs and vagene, this anime is ok for you ig this is getting awkward. But yeah, all in all its a trullly enjoyable anime<br />
<br />
edit: this is ridiculous. this kid can kill god by calling out boobs<br />
edit 2: he touches them and becomes invincible

    High School DxD Hero completely retcon&#039;s BoRN&#039;s ending for a different direction and thus continues the crazy fanservicey mythological adventures of Hyodou Issei.<br />
<br />
Since this is LA&#039;s first review on MAL on the High School DxD series, LA might as well give LA&#039;s opinions on the series before tackling this installment of High School DxD. The first season was a good stepping stone to the series, applying all the world building as well as Hyodou&#039;s weaknesses to set us off, though the fanservice vs. tension did get in the way but nonetheless the first season was getting used to balancing it. &quot;New&quot; was dove in deep

          <span style="display: none;" id="review283006">
        to it&#039;s supporting characters, from Yuuto to Akeno as well as expanding the world building of the underworld and heaven in the process. BoRN was expanding even further on the the fact that legends and myths are REAL in High School DxD&#039;s world thus they become allies and villains set out to do their plans just with some rocky character development here and there especially from Hyoudou himself and now in Hero well...<br />
<br />
Ohh and LA is Team Akeno by the way anyways carrying on...<br />
<br />
Because of the retcon Hero immediately did, LA DID welcome it as LA was indifferent to BoRN&#039;s ending as it DID come out of nowhere but was melodramatic as all hell in the process, Hero&#039;s beginning fixed that to say the least.<br />
<br />
So from that Hero leads into the &quot;Kyoto arc&quot; as well as the &quot;Rating Game with Sairaorg Bael&quot;. The Kyoto arc leads into the previous villain in a previous season of Cao Cao voiced by Kosuke Toriumi, the leader of the Khaos Brigade as well as new characters Kunou voiced by Sora Tokui a kitsune youkai trying to find her mother which the Occult Club (Second Years anyways) finds while on their field trip to Kyoto. To say the least the Kyoto arc feels similar to BoRN&#039;s structuring of plot, where a large threat arrives and where Hyodou and the gang needs to stop them from enacting their plans in the process, LA was fine with the Kyoto arc and was it was presented as well as the character development and improvement to the Second Years&#039; power dynamic (plus the addition of screentime to Roseeweisse  to sub in for Akeno..well LA anyways), plus the villain of this arc IS such a huge threat that links in as to why they are in Kyoto as well as their plans that involved Kunou&#039;s mother and linking all this together was great, that and a mystery of a mass groping incident which has links to Hyodou&#039;s growing power. ALL in all, Kyoto arc was decent and reflecting the previous season&#039;s callbacks and structuring.<br />
<br />
If Kyoto arc was reflecting BoRN&#039;s great points, then the Rating Game with Sairaorg was a better version of the first season&#039;s Rating Game. See this arc was focusing on three things, Hyodou and Rias&#039; relationship and development to Sairaorg as a character. Hyodou and Ria&#039;s relationship by all means was ALOT of people&#039;s problems which was encased by Hyodou&#039;s denseness to Rias&#039; advances especially in BoRN but Hyoudou is such a harem seeker and wants to help anyone as possible (harem or not) that this kind of mindset gives a gaping hole on Rias which Rias&#039;s outburst was warranted, she was more or less feeling left out because she was &quot;President&quot; in Hyoudou&#039;s eyes. To that, LA knows what most of you will say that &quot;Hyoudou is and ALWAYS dense, he doesn&#039;t change&quot;, actually Hero and by extension from the start of the second season, though he has the perverseness to him, Hyoudou did grow through all his fights he encountered and learned from that to being the best fighter and protector to the Rias family in the process...he DID grow and move on but with the lingering guilt and fear he still has on the first season which Hyoudou by the end of this season...he moves on and finally he finally takes the hint and thus Hyodou FINALLY does and say to Rias after four seasons! The main focus however does go to Sairaorg and he&#039;s quite different from the many &quot;blanket evil characters&quot; Hyodou has meet and his backstory and his goals are VERY similar to Hyoudou himself. Sairaorg by all means has alot of similarities to Hyodou, being a powerful character but is currently unrecognized by the underworld and Sairaorg wanting to gain his notoriety and his family pride back and will do anything for his family (mainly to do with his comatosed mother and wanting to revive her), his not a black or white villain but more like he&#039;s the friendly rival to Hyodou and someone Hydou wants to strive to be and maybe even beat which is what the climax for Hero leads up to for this arc. <br />
<br />
Ddraig this season does gets development in the form of Hyodou&#039;s powers growing exponentially by the means of Hyoudou speaking to the predecessors of the Red Dragon Emperor and this only improves in the world building front but more on Hyodou&#039;s increasing power and sometimes his beliefs conflicting with his predecessors and seriously considering all the powerful rivals and villains Hero gives us, you KNOW Hyodou grows crazy strong this season to keep up with them. Yes because of this, Hyodou is the only one to stop many of the threats in Hero by the end of all this, but Hero did at least manage to make use of it&#039;s cast and make screentime for them in terms of battles at least as powercrept Hyodou is. Hyoudou also gets titled as the Boob Dragon and even has his own children kid shows in the underworld due to his notoriety in the underworld and considering High School DxD&#039;s nature of fanservice in even some of the most tense moments, yes even this becomes a plot point, tonal dissonance sure, but it&#039;s within the nature of High School DxD to do this...at least for us to breathe in a ways when the batshit crazy battles that does happen.<br />
<br />
On speaking of the Boob Dragon, well Hero doesn&#039;t screw around with it&#039;s fanservice, though if your watching it censored...then....your missing out on some of the fanservicey moments what with Hydou&#039;s continuously expanding harem trying their luck with Hyodou in the process. Watch Hero uncensored if possible as Hero is unbashed about it&#039;s fanservice but it&#039;s to the fourth season...seriously FOURTH, it&#039;s to be expected.<br />
<br />
With that, well the animation studio had another change, from TNK to Passione and well ALOT of people didn&#039;t like the new polished and sleeker character designs but LA was fine with it because at the very least the animation was consistent even it&#039;s more batshit crazy battles. Passione did a very good job all things considered, from the newer character designs, great battle animation and decent backgrounding reflecting the previous seasons. <br />
<br />
Voice acting, well LA&#039;s bias to Shizuka Ito as Akeno but her screentime was VERY small to say the least. but with the original voice cats back again as well as some new ones like Sora Tokui as Kunou and Asuka Nishi as Ravel Phoenix, but LA would most probably give MVP to Yoko Hikasa as Rias this season not by sheer screentime but Rias went through ALOT of stuff this season even during the Kyoto arc and that Yoko Hikasa just really did a great job once again reprising her role as Rias and giving us great range. Overall with the huge cast of characters new and old, the voice cast of High School DxD was expectedly great.<br />

Hero seemed to have learned from it&#039;s previous season&#039;s mistakes while at the same time greatly improving on it&#039;s strengths in the process, from Hyodou and Rias&#039; relationship, giving us high stakes and new settings while keeping the nature of High School DxD in the process and finally giving us something of a satisfying ending in which it can definitely lead to something more in another season if possible but if not, still allowing Hero to be a great installment to the series. In terms of seasons, LA did find Hero to be better than New, but it&#039;s on par or maybe even surpassing BoRN because Hero just hit all the sweet spots in terms of characters and plot in which BoRN couldn&#039;t hold out by the end but still did good on it&#039;s characters. <br />
<br />
ALOT of people watch High School DxD for the &quot;plot&quot;, but High School DxD Hero clearly shows it can be much more than that.

    I watched all the High School DxD&#039;s in 3 days, and I have to say that when I finished season 3 i was like &quot; Hot damn now that was some fucking awesome story line, character development, hype, and action that I have seen&quot; I hadnt felt that way since I saw Gohan go SSJ2 when i was 11. But this shit. Season 4, legit 180 turn in the completely wrong dimension. Here are some reasons why.<br />
<br />
Reason 1: THE ACTUAL GOOD CHARACTERS ARE GONE FOR LIKE 4 EPISODES<br />
- Rias and Akeno are my favorite, but I am forced to endure 4 episodes in a row

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302540">
        with their fucking bath cameos, know I like them and all but I prefer watching their interactions with Issei and I am sick af of watching them fucking complain that he is gone. <br />
<br />
Reason 2: Issei... I dont know when the fuck you are ever going to learn from your fucking mistakes. Like, jesus how many more fucking times we gotta do the same shit. Some guy kicks ur ass, you ask for boobs and then u get powerful. I understand that thats the whole premise of the show. But for fucks sake this is their fourth season if we are throwing the whole fucking plot out the window at least have some character development.<br />
<br />
Reason 3: I was drained by the time I was on the tenth episode, I was already pissed with the whole &quot;oh why doesnt he call me Rias thing.&quot; like bitch just fucking ask him. I know that in the finale she said &quot;Oh I didnt have the courage&quot;... like hello, you pressed ur fucking naked ass body against him the first fucking time you met him yet you cant have the fucking courage to legit just ask him to call you by your frucking name. Like hello what kind of fucking monstrosity does that entail. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, prepare to see the biggest fucking ball drop in terms of disappointment when you watch this season. Like if it werent for the confession at the end and the nice epsiode 1 that we had, I wouldve flat out given this shit a goddamn 3 like it was that fucking horrible. Whoever took High School DxD needs to get a boost right to the goddamn nuts cause they just fucking cucked the rest of us into the next goddamn dimension.

    First off, I am a light novel reader, and I love how we get a great adaption, but this season could of been better and my closing notes will detail why.<br />
Story 6\10<br />
Before I get crucified, I find volumes 9-10 which this series was covering the most boring while reading. I was also getting used to all the changes because of a new studio so it was hard to be engrossed as well. Since season 3 was not fully cannon and missed a ton of important parts, they had to skip a lot so some things were skipped in order to keep cannon which confused every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281973">
        anime only watcher I talked to, and it was annoying for me too. Examples also being the rating game Sitri VS Gremory.<br />
Sound 8\10 not including old tracks 4\10<br />
The OST of high school dxd is great, but this season added hardly any new tracks and the weakest op and ed. I give dxd 8\10 overall on sound but judging season 4 tracks alone its bad.<br />
Character 9\10<br />
Not really much to say here but the faithfulness to the light novel helped the characters which we all love but some like xenovia just seemed utterly off but thats just one thing. If you are here at 4 season you know the characters are great.<br />
Art and animation 3\10<br />
Man on man did the art style start a flame war, I saw it divide the fandom. I think the new art style is okay and if it was just the art I had a problem with, I would give this a higher score but we will get to the animation in a second.<br />
They switched up character designs, my waifu akeno looks derpy and the full changes they have done to characters turned me off the most as it did with others but some look fine with the new art style like asia, rosweisse and others and some like Akeno and Rias look worse. The old animation by TNK looks more mature and the fanservice in the last seasons made it look as if all the characters chest looked different and different body types, now the boobs look almost the same.<br />
The animation is bad, if it was good I would give this a 7\10 and say I am just not a fan of the new art style and leave it but its bad. The facial expressions are done horribly, lots of standstill images, choppy at times, action looks like something from ten years ago and fight scenes were choreographed better in the past. Character designs as well as them using a 3d painted background while exploring kyoto in episode 3 or 4 which looked awful. Animation was bad and with getting used to the utterly 180 art style changed that took away from the show. Part of me wants to give this a 2 almost.<br />
Enjoyment 5\10<br />
Honestly, this season did not have me looking forward to the next episode at all unlike the other seasons of dxd, the art style changed took time to get used to and I still do not like it since many people were drawn to the gorgeous art style of TNK and we get this boring plain art style thats not fun to look at all. The facial expressions I noticed right away like others and once you noticed it, you can&#039;t ignore it. If you do not know what I am talking about count your blessings because you will notice it next time you see it or rewatch it. Rating game was not as fun as others as well as this was the most boring parts of the LN for me. I will say that dxd is one of my favorite animes of all time, but I really can&#039;t care too much for the anime at the moment so I may stick to just reading it. With the flame wars and backlash on this season however I don&#039;t think we might get a season 5.<br />
Overall 6\10<br />
I wish this season was better, I really do. I even prefer the non cannon season 3. The art style divided the fandom and I would even go as far to call the fandom more toxic than its ever been. The reason we have a new studio is because TNK was not following the LN properly so the series got handed over to passione, the studio that really should not have it out of all studio&#039;s I could think of.

    I normally hold back from writing reviews, because I dont want people to get affected by my subjective opinion but; FUCK ME.<br />
<br />
Never in my life had I thought I would be that highly disappointed. As mentioned its my subjective opinion and I know  a lot of people love the new animation and character design but seeing the &quot;new&quot; Asia nearly made me cry.<br />
<br />
How could they ever possibly fuck up that hard. The artwork from the previous 3 season was beautiful and now I cant even watch the first few episode without hating myself and this world. I am deeply ashamed to be called a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408035">
        human; just like those fuckheads who ruined Akeno, Asia, Koneko; matter of fact they fucking ruined every single character.<br />
<br />
I will torture myself through this season but I can guarantee I will not enjoy it. If u dont want to get eye cancer, I would recommend u never even bother to watch season 4. Thanks for reading!

    Season 4: Great Season<br />
<br />
I’ll admit, the art style did change and the characters felt off at first. AT FIRST. I didn’t know what happened, so I was being ignorant and biased. I didn’t like this season at first. But after rewatching it, it started to grow on me. When I learned about the studio change, I was able to accept season 4 more.<br />
This season is actually better than season 3 in terms of plot, source material, and development. Art style, it’s debatable with who you’re talking to. I like the designs on most of the characters. Rias, Xenovia, and Kiba took some time, but it’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369668">
        not AS BAD as everyone is making it out to be. Animation was actually better than all three seasons. While episode 0 retconned the ending of season 3 and the current studio didn’t do what the old studio did, the Juggernaut Drive sequence is more visually haunting and threatening, and the action sequences in this show does have weight to it.<br />
The villains are interesting in this season. The Hero Faction is an interesting concept to be depicted as villains, and they’re set up for what’s to come next season. Sairaorg is an interesting foil/ally to Issei and Rias, and I like how the second half of season 4 was an Rating game rather than another villain finale.<br />
The world-building keeps on coming. Issei develops more into a man, but still a pervert. I did like how they sidelined Rias, Akeno, And Koneko to give Asia, Xenovia, Irina, and Rossweisse time to develop within the story and with Issei. Ravel’s re-introduction to the cast was unexpected, but I understood it after reading light novels 11–12.<br />
Best Moments: Issei vs Sairaorg; Issei’s time with Asia, Xenovia, Irina, and Rossweisse; Kyoto Bridge and Town Fight; Issei and Rias helping Sairaorg’s mom; Sauna Scene; Akeno, Koneko, Asia, Xenovia, and Irina comforting Issei; Rating Game; and Issei and Rias kiss!<br />
This is just me, I prefer the new art style because I feel that the characters in this show does look closely to being real and the animation is actually better. I do think that they could try mixing the old animation with the new animation for Rias, Xenovia, Kiba , and Vali. Maybe Great Red and Tannin too, but just for size. I’m not hung up on art styles, so I can accept what’s being given.

    Beautiful, Brilliant, Epic and Emotional! Season 4 is outstanding and before watching this I didn&#039;t have big expectations but how foolish I was to think like that...<br />
<br />
Studio Passione despite changing the art style managed to give this show some substance, created a fitting emotional atmosphere  for exposing the character&#039;s bonds, a better presentation for the characters and managed to give more screen time to one of the most badass characters Azazel. Another reason to check this season out beside Azazazel is Sairaoug and goddam he is one of the manliest characters from this show! Why? Because like others who rely on sacred gears and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282970">
        other stuff this man fights using his bare fists and his overwhelming fighting aura..A man with honor ,a man of his word who respects his opponents  giving everything he has during a fight!<br />
<br />
Issei and Rias&#039;s bond in this season goes beyond master servant and they finally managed to get to a starting point in their new relationship....And what I like and always will love from this anime are the girls who aren&#039;t like those stupid stereotypes who say &quot;Die&quot; or &quot;Baka&quot; after the main character sees them naked or half naked in contrary the girls are the ones who almost jump on Issei(Lucky bastard...) with their beautiful shaped breasts who will make any man jealous.....<br />
<br />
As for the characters&#039;s traits no worry this season keeps up the good tradition and you will see your beloved Xenovia keeping up the good work in making babies with the red emperor, Koneko healing Issei wounds , Akeno sucking the poison from his body and etc...<br />
The story is not something overwhelming or outstanding it&#039;s the typical power-up main character who fights the other power-up characters but in this season their are some moments who give a good reason  Why and for Who Issei is fighting . Is enjoyable so what do you want more? Plus the beautiful girls will put a smile on your face after a bad day....<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some emotional moments in this show that  gave me a nice surprise, some fights were predictable but damn  enjoyable I won&#039;t deny that. The &quot;Emperor Boob&quot; stuff was kinda out of place sometimes but I am glad it didn&#039;t ruined the heartwarming moments and the emotional atmosphere created around the characters. I think what I liked the most from this season is how this show managed to go into Issei&#039;s mind during his fight with Sairaoug depicting his thoughts, emotions and reasons for why is he standing there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give it a try and don&#039;t listen to those rumours about the art style being bad in contrary for me the new  art style  made characters like Xenovia, Irina, Asia and Koneko look better than their previous designs....This show is damn enjoyable and the fanservice is done well and this is coming from someone who doesn&#039;t watches this kind of shows but appreciates what this season has accomplished so far!<br />

    While the story is terrible compared to the three earlier seasons, it is still a barrel of laughs. Not because it has good or clever jokes, but just the sheer amount of stupidity. <br />
<br />
It brings back memories from the first season, which I absolutely loved. It was just excellent. It was so stupid, but it didn&#039;t matter, the show made you laugh either way. <br />
<br />
This season manages to catch this feeling very well. Albeit at the cost of emotional moments. While the emotional moments are often ruined, it feels kinda nice to just take a step back, and watch it just to have fun.<br />
<br />
Though this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280638">
        tactic of drawing in the viewers is likely to backfire because many of us (myself included) no longer watch the show for the stupidity, but for the story. <br />
<br />
While I definitely do miss the amazing storyline and emotional moments, it is incredibly nice to just settle back to something similar to the first season. <br />
<br />
Though I say this is similar to the first season, it does lack a lot of key points the first season had. Jokes in this fourth season have dropped in quality, the story has fallen completely apart, and the art style is appalling compared to the three previous seasons.<br />
<br />
Even though it lacks these key points, it is undoubtedly still fun to watch, and I&#039;d recommend it to anyone into comedy/harem anime<br />
<br />
I also wanna say that (supposedly) both the art and story is written and drawn in a manner that is closer to the light novel. I can&#039;t confirm this though since I haven&#039;t read the light novels nor do I think I will,<br />
<br />
Btw let&#039;s not talk about Taiikukan-ura no Holy. The remake of the last four episodes of the third season.<br />
<br />
I refuse to call it canon.<br />
I simply refuse.
