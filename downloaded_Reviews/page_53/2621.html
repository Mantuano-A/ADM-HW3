        and a timid girl who&#039;s had a crush on him for a long time, Kasugano Midori, are thrown into this very situation. Do we sense romance coming up? Definitely! Comedy? Has to be! Action? Uh, maybe... Ecchi? What!?<br />
<br />
No, I am not kidding, the show has all that, with the main focus on the first two. Because when your right hand loves you, that&#039;s bound to escalate into a romantic comedy, right? Midori no Hibi (Midori&#039;s Days) executes a somewhat standard living-together romantic comedy setting with a refreshing twist, and also does a great job of not leaning too much towards the ecchi side of things. You see some topless females now and then and some bikini shots, but that&#039;s all you really get, and after bad experiences with ecchi-intensive shows like Kanokon and Rosario+Vampire, I&#039;m very delighted to see a show that manages to keep it on a decent level and focus on something else. Action scenes are scattered around too; our blond main character is a delinquent after all. <br />
<br />
The episodes of Midori no Hibi does nothing special; each episode features a new (mis)adventure in the now jumbled-up lives of Seji and Midori. Be it an otaku who thinks Seji is a doll maniac, a girl who really likes Seji or a trip to a hot spring, you&#039;ll be taken through a lot of before-seen situations, and some new. The ending is cute and happy, and when you think about it, the only good ending an anime as Midori no Hibi could have. And while the unoriginal way in which the final episode is played out comes off as borderline facepalm-provoking, it was still an enjoyable watch, right up until the final scene.<br />
<br />
One of the things I love the most about Midori no Hibi-- No, the thing I do love the most about it is the whole concept about bringing out what&#039;s on the inside of oneself, both feelings of love and supressed personality traits. While the characters don&#039;t develop much in the sense that their personalities actually change, they do develop by bringing out feelings of love or personality traits which are in ways hidden from others. And while we have all seen the soft-on-the-inside delinquent and the timid girl, the producers have done a good job with them in regards to the aforementioned aspect. And who can forget the uptight and determined yet tender Takako Ayase whose unrequited feelings of love towards Seji never comes to play, or the otaku who seemingly had a more human side to him inside, but in the end was no more than a crazed otaku anyway? When all comes to all, the cast isn&#039;t extremely original nor large, but a lovable gang nevertheless.<br />
<br />
The quality of the animation is quite good for this kind of series. The whole story takes place in a city, and there&#039;s frequent scenes on high places with scenic views of said city, which are usually animated quite well, from lights in the streets to the monorails criss-crossing the cityscape. Street views of the city and other close-ups such as furniture in rooms are usually beautiful and detailed, but the quality does deteriorate from time to time. The strongest point however, is found in the gorgeous lighting and shading effects. They are eminently soft and relaxing, and especially during the dusk scenes do they come off as tremedous. The character designs are in an entirely different class however, as they are very varying in quality; often no more than mediocre yet often very good. A few close-ups looked like simple Flash animations, while at times they were detailed and fluid, both in design and movement. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack was more than likely the weakest part of the anime. Not that it was outright bad; it was in fact quite atmospheric and fit well with the series, but there were no outstanding songs in the background music, and they were quite standard-fare for a romantic comedy. Two mellifluous themes for the opening and ending make up for some of it however, and the voice acting is superb too; the seiyuu manage to portray the characters very well, both their current mood and their character types.<br />
<br />
You may have noticed how I used &#039;soft&#039; or some variant of it frequently in my review (was there some anti-aliasing feature for this show I didn&#039;t notice was on?), and that&#039;s just what it was. Soft, happy and cute. And just the right length to make it stay that way. If it was one season longer, I&#039;m dead certain the show&#039;s quality would have worsened. And part of its charm is that it is such a short watch anyway. If you want a show that&#039;s short and charming, Midori no Hibi is the show for you!

    I read the synopsis for this anime, and I just had to watch it. I mean, a girl becoming a boy\&#039;s right hand? Impossible!<br />
<br />
Oh it\&#039;s possible. In Midori No Hibi, Sawamura seiji is a well known delinquent with a \&amp;quot;devil\&#039;s right hand\&amp;quot;, he\&#039;s known to be in alot of fights with bad people. He\&#039;s dying for a girlfriend, but he gets rejected by every girl that he approaches.. and he just came to the conclusion that his right hand will be his one and only companion. (That sounds wrong..) Until.. he wakes up one day to find out that a girl named Midori is his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review560">
        right hand, and has had a crush on him since forever!<br />
<br />
I really liked this anime, it was too sweet. I got so caught up in it.. I finished it today.. and I only started it yesterday. Anime\&#039;s that I finish quickly like that have my full concentration. It was the storyline that caught me, but with watching it, loads of other things made me continue to watch it.<br />
<br />
One.. the love Midori had for Seiji, it\&#039;s crazy. She loved him with all of his heart, despite him being known as a delinquent. Two, how hilarious alot of the episodes were, I was expecting it to be funny, I mean come one a girl is a boy\&#039;s right hand, there had to be hidden gags in just that right? Three.. just the romance, I wasn\&#039;t expecting it to become so romance-y all of a sudden, but it did and I loved every single bit of it.<br />
<br />
I think the main thing that made me want to watch this until the end was to see how she became his right hand, and to see if he ever got a girlfriend. But this anime is really light hearted, and it\&#039;s just something to watch if you want a bit of a laugh, a bit of romance. I teared up in the last episode, I didn\&#039;t want it to end. I wanted it to go on a little more, but that would be silly.. it couldn\&#039;t have gone on for much longer.<br />
<br />
The music is beautiful, the opening themes and ending themes are so nice to listen to. An enjoyable anime, definitely. Just because it has a not believable plot.. doesn\&#039;t mean it isn\&#039;t good.

    Title: Midori no Hibi<br />
<br />
Manga or Japanese Anime: Midori no Hibi is 13 episodes long, and ran on Japanese TV fron April 3rd, 2004 to June 26th, 2004.  Its manga run is done as well, having run from January 18th, 2003 to October 18th, 2004 in Shogakukan&#039;s magazine Shonen Sunday.  Viz is releasing the manga Stateside, and the final volume (number eight) will be out Stateside October 10th.  Media Blasters did a dub of Midori no Hibi, translated as Midori Days, and the final volume (number three) was released back in 2005.<br />
<br />
Story: Seiji Sawamura is a high schooler who likes to get into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review907">
        fights, and has an infamous &amp;quot;devil&#039;s right hand&amp;quot;; however, this doesn&#039;t have the greatest reprecussions for his love life (he&#039;s asked out twenty girls and been rejected by them all as of late). Midori is a girl who has a crush on Seiji, but can&#039;t work up the courage to talk to him.<br />
<br />
One morning after lamenting the night before that he&#039;ll be stuck with no one but his right hand for a companion the rest of his life, he wakes up to Midori on his right hand. <br />
<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
The situation is pretty odd, to say the least, but, oddly enough, it works out really well, especially as a comedy.  The romance between the two is really sweet to watch as the series unfolds.  Midori is amazingly sweet, upbeat, and dotes over Seiji at every given changce. Oddly enough, she doesn&#039;t get on my nerves like most of her character types do.  And even though Seiji has a tough-guy image and can be oblivious to Midori at points, he does show his soft side more than once.<br />
<br />
Episodes, more often than not, follow what I&#039;ve dubbed the triple F formula -- fighting, fanservice, and fluff.  Episodes seem to be polarized: they tend to either be really good, or really sucky, with none hitting any marks between.  These two points are probably the only drawbacks to the story.<br />
<br />
Art Style: The animation was done by Studio Pierrot, which also did the anime for Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket.  To me, Fushigi Yuugi and Fruits Basket seemed heavily stylized in one way or another.  This didn&#039;t seem that way.  Beautiful character designs, smooth animation... not much I can find wrong with this, really.<br />
<br />
Music: The soundtrack for this series rawqs.  There&#039;s a basic theme, outside of the opening and ending, that you hear throughout the series in various forms.  It doesn&#039;t get boring at all, oddly enough.  Jazz, acoustic guitar, and classical-esque themes are the order of the day apart from aforementioned variations.  The opening and ending aren&#039;t all that bad, either.  I mean, they aren&#039;t particularly memorable, but they&#039;re still nice songs that fit the series well.<br />
<br />
Voice Seiyuus: Good.  There aren&#039;t really any roles that particularly stand out to me, but I do like the seiyuu that were chosen for the roles, as they fit the characters well.<br />
<br />
Voice Actors: Pretty much what I said above; no standout roles, but the voices still fit well, and don&#039;t get on my nerves like most VA dubs tend to do.<br />
<br />
Dub: The first I saw of Midori no Hibi was the dub of the fourth episode on a Newtype sampler.  All in all, Media Blasters did an okay job with the dub; not many liberties taken with the dialogue, and no censoring that I could see.<br />
<br />
Length: This is where the series suffers a bit.  Thirteen episodes doesn&#039;t seem like all that much, but, with the triple f formula and the polarization of episodes make the series drag a bit.<br />
<br />
Overall: Has some minor issues with story and length, but everything else is perfect.  If you&#039;re looking for an over-the-top romantic comedy, then this is for you.<br />
<br />

    Now you’d think, at least I certainly thought, that the show would go straight to the gutter with this idea. Incredibly, it retains this really appealing sweetness and innocence throughout, not forced or sugary, just…Disney-like, I guess. I mean good Disney, not all that crap that came out after the late 90s. That’s not to say it’s a clean show, ooooh no, the humor is delightfully pervy, but it avoids far more dirty jokes than it pursues despite the various body humor jokes and endless barrages of giggle-worthy nudity. <br />
<br />
After a while, anime humor tends to run together, but Midori Days’ brand of twisted giggles

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16093">
        feels strangely novel, and I think a lot of it is the frequent interludes of character’s fantasies and head-movies. Yes, head-movies, complete with credits. The story is regularly charming and uplifting, due largely to the fact that Seiji is not just a cliché bad-mouthed punk and Midori is not a cliché moe girl either. <br />
<br />
Seiji beats up other thugs just to rescue their pummeled victims because he remembers being a weakling when he was younger, and he’s still naturally adorkable when he’s not trying to act street. And Midori has a lot of spirit and spunk that she’s dying to express after being freed from a lot of her old anxieties, the development of which is really fun to watch. I think based on her cooking alone she’s earned her keep, but Seiji may have his mind on other disadvantages. (Use your imagination.) Unlike Midori, he is not enjoying this bizarre new spell and wants things to change back as soon as possible. Now if you’ve seen the movie Groundhog Day, you already know how things are going to turn out here. The fun is in the journey, and for the most part, the journey is a total riot with a tenderly sentimental conclusion. Miraculously, the mushy wrap-up does not feel forced either, making this really a gem of a romcom.<br />
<br />
On the technical side of things, the animation is okay, but nothing particularly special. Character designs are very easy on the eyes, but it’s still very very basic, especially for a brief 13-episoder. <br />
<br />
The music is fairly kitschy, but amusing, seeing as it’s used to highlight adorably stupid situations. <br />
<br />
The voice acting infinitely makes up for shortcomings in either case, though. Of course it sounds great in Japanese, but did the goofiness translate in the dub? Ooooh yes. Let’s just say I’m sorely disappointed that I haven’t heard Seiji’s voice actor in more roles, because he does a top-tier job. He’s as cartoony as need be for all the goofiness, but he also sounds to all extents like a normal teenager. You know how you hear a lot of anime characters enunciate perfectly, even the rough ones? Well, Drew Aaron as Seiji does not, and the casual snideness of the result is very nice on the ears, and very very funny. Midori is also perfect. Usually the high squeaky schoolgirl voice makes you want smear honey on your ears and blow a bear whistle, but Kether Fernandez goes into the ultimate octaves and still sounds very pleasant. Her unnatural pitch is actually excused by her physical situation, as we discover when Seiji switches places with her in a humorous nightmare episode and sounds like he’s been dippin’ in the helium as well. There are still a few grating cheeses in the most minor roles here, but the leads certainly compensate for them.<br />
<br />
I’ve already had my sick sick fun telling you what I enjoyed about the show, but I guess I should admit that it has more than a handful of problems. Actually, with all things in Seiji’s life, it’s woman trouble. His mean, drunk sister as well as a little girl and a classmate who have crushes on him all add to the story well when they’re used sparingly, but when they get their own episodes, the show goes from very good to really really bad. Those few episodes in the middle push the series to the limits of poor taste and cheap shots, and I have to wonder why the writers ever thought it was a good idea to take the focus away from Midori and the effect she has on her disgruntled host bad-boy. <br />
<br />
Not that the show is any more plausible in such cases. The animators can never really decide how Midori is attached to Seiji’s wrist, so they do avoid showing us, but it’s a little silly to think that TP-ing her is going to fool anyone. There are countless scenes, actually, where Midori pokes her head out and she and Seiji have a conversation in broad daylight and no one notices. The most minimal effort is made to hide her and it works, against all logic. I think Seiji goes to a school for students with impaired vision…who refuse to wear glasses. I’m not kidding, I’d totally believe it. The only character with glasses is also the only character that immediately notices Midori on Seiji’s arm. Co-inky-dink? I THINK NOT. <br />
<br />
That, and this show is kinda fanservice-heavy, by which I mean there are only three episodes of the show with no big plump titties in them at some point. You have been warned, for good or ill. Eh. Once you’ve seen two, you’ve seen ‘em all. I’ll never quite understand the male fascination with funbags.<br />
<br />
All in all, a surprisingly rewarding romantic comedy that balances innocence and bawdiness, laughter and tears, but yeah, it stoops pretty low on a few too many occasions, and it’s predictable and silly as all get-out. Twisted good fun!<br />

    Delinquent gets a cute little girl for a right hand? Who knew this plot line would actually work? <br />
<br />
This anime is definitely the embodiment of the words &amp;ldquo;romantic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;comedy&amp;rdquo;, i.e. Romantic Comedy in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t catch my drift. It&amp;rsquo;s about the relationship of reformed delinquent (Seiji) and the girl who took the place of his right hand (Midori). They go through daily life learning about each other, at the same time trying to avoid circumstances that will reveal their secret.<br />
<br />
The anime went beyond my expectations. It was funnier than I thought &amp;ndash; the number of gags in the first episode was enough to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review471">
        make me stick around and look forward to see the rest. It&amp;rsquo;s also ecchi-er than I thought. I think out of 13 episodes, there were about 7-8 (possibly more) episodes that showed scenes of exposed breasts, courtesy of Midori (bite size ones), Seiji&amp;rsquo;s sister Orin and Ayase. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was vulgar though, since the nudity were used cleverly and for comical relief. This means a lot coming from someone like me who hates fan service. I like the plots per episode. It went from going to a figurine shop reeking of figurine otaku, to dealing with a preteen fan. The themes were just nicely done and clever.<br />
<br />
The ending was a tad predictable though, but I didn\&#039;t know if it would end the way I thought it would end. Well it did - and I&amp;rsquo;d say it was a big &amp;ldquo;whew&amp;rdquo;. <br />
<br />
The main characters were likable. Seiji was funny, of course. He had some depth to him, so that was good. Midori is oh so adorable! Her personality was likable, and she&amp;rsquo;s naturally funny. I have to ask though, why is she so shy when she&amp;rsquo;s life size, and loud and outgoing when she became Seiji&amp;rsquo;s right hand? Generally, almost everyone is likable. When I said &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo;, I meant everyone except Orin. She is definitely not ladylike, and was mean to Seiji.<br />
<br />
The drawing style was so-so. It was simple, but what I really like about it is that the characters all looked so distinct so it was easy to tell them apart. Most of the time, characters in one anime all look similar and the only way to tell them apart was their hair or eye color. This was not the case for Midori Days &amp;ndash; The characters were all looked distinct and different. Midori had nice big green eyes, Ayase looked cunning, Seiji&amp;rsquo;s look fit his personality well and the same goes for every other character. There were times when the characters would waver, but it was slight so you can brush it off easily. <br />
<br />
They also used some CG to compliment the scenes, that&amp;rsquo;s always good. I also want to take note of episode 7, where they used &amp;ldquo;manga&amp;rdquo; scenes to portray Ayase&amp;rsquo;s date plan. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s the same quality as the ones used in FLCL, but I heard that the ones in FLCL cost a lot. It was nevertheless impressive, and it also complimented that episode well. <br />
<br />
The voice acting was nicely done. The seiyus matched their characters well, especially Midori&amp;rsquo;s seiyu (forgot her name, though). Midori&amp;rsquo;s voice, accent and vocabulary made her even cuter. I loved it when she would say &amp;ldquo;desho?&amp;rdquo; at the end of almost every sentence. <br />
<br />
I liked the music. Their was a wide variety of BGM and each one was made to fit a scene well. I do remember hearing the distinct BGM of a scene from the first episode, and I thought to myself how it complimented that scene well and it made the scene much funnier. The opening was OK, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my type of music, but it really fit the last part of the last episode. I really liked the ending theme though, it was sung by Saori Atsumi who sang Biidama, another song I really like. <br />
<br />
It was a good watch &amp;ndash; from the first episode to the last. It was pretty stable, in terms of how I liked it. There weren&amp;rsquo;t notable high points or low points, it was just alright. What I liked best about it was the humor, and of course, the adorable Midori. Can&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a must-see.

    I had high hopes for this anime, but they were dashed after only two episodes. The plot just ... is frankly very pathetic. The characters and artwork (big eyes creep me out) are pretty lame and overall you might get a few chuckles. But other than that the series doesn&#039;t hold much enjoyment.

    When I first heard about Mindoi No Hibi my friend Alex was over and when he told me about it, we decided to watch it since we are both hopeless weebs and well heres my review. I have mix emotions about Midori No Hibi at first I was drawn in by the prepostorous plot and a hilariously fat cat! Due to this animes lack of progression however ive come to realize that you could of watched the first 2 episodes and than watch the last and not really be all that confused about whats happening. If I were to say I iked it it would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181097">
        be because it was fun and made me laugh on occasion. If I were to say I disliked it, I would say because of all animes I&#039;ve ever seen, no anime has ever made me this angry. Whenever something was going to happen that would move the anime forward Midori would put a stop to it because of her selfishness and it made me hate her as a character.... Every episode other than the first 2 and the last 2 felt like filler that you had to grind through! Overall I would not recommendl this anime although it is somewhat of a fun ride, just be aware that you&#039;ll be doing about 9 episodes worth of waiting for something meaningful to happen!

    My friend recommended this to me years back, telling me it&#039;s about a guy who&#039;s hand turns into a girl. To me, this idea sounds like an excuse for an anime packed full of fanservice and vulgar jokes, many of them probably involving the main character forgetting about his hand being a girl and using it for activities such as, er... well, I&#039;ll leave that to your imagination. <br />
<br />
...and this is why I&#039;ve never really felt a great urgency to try &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot;.<br />
<br />
But now that I have finally gotten around to watching this, I have to admit it&#039;s not as bad as I thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31523">
        it was going to be. Yes it did contain some of the distastefulness that I was expecting, but the dirty jokes didn&#039;t get out of hand (*rim shot*) and go as far as I&#039;d feared. Instead, &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot; turned out to be something that&#039;s probably best described as a fun, entertaining anime that&#039;s not to be taken too seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Midori no Hibi&quot; is essentially a romantic comedy, and the comedy is the main strength of it. A lot of it is pretty slap stick, but I couldn&#039;t help laughing out loud at times because some parts are just so funneh. The romance side has some nice touches too. One of its main strengths is the interaction and developing relationship between the two main characters Seiji and Midori, which is good since that&#039;s one of the focal points of the show. The story has originality, and did not turn out as predictable as I expected, but with such a bizarre set up, inevitably there are a lot of character &quot;fudging&quot; going on to make it work, like Midori&#039;s reaction after she first finds out what had happened to her. To be frank, I find it almost disturbing that she seems to be able to just accept the strange situation so readily and then adapt to it so quickly without missing the things in her old life that you&#039;d expect to be important to her - she seems to care very little about her family, for example. The characters are generally likeable and it&#039;s easy to sympathise with their problems, but some of the character development feels hurried - there seem to be no transitional stage involved as Midori opens up from being an introvert, and the way one of the characters Ayase changed her attitude towards Seiji also seems a bit sudden.<br />
<br />
Even though &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot; does not hold up to close scrutiny, it passes easily for a casual watch due to its entertainment values. There are some Ecchi jokes that the series could have done without, but as I said there isn&#039;t as much as I thought there would be. Presentation wise, &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot; is fairly unremarkable to look at, but it does have a reasonably good sound track with some nice BGM&#039;s and a pretty good ending theme. The show was popular around the time of its release, but now the ratings seems to have fallen. Probably deserved - it&#039;s a mildly enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable watch.

    This story entails a high school boy named Sawamura Seiji. He is feared by most because of rumors spread about his delinquent ways, and his &amp;quot;Devils Right Hand&amp;quot;. This is nothing but the truth as he fights for just causes and is very caring. He has numerous failed attempts at love. <br />
<br />
The story was very gripping, its very easy to fall in love with this anime, and with Sawamura as he is falling in love. It is heart wrenching at the end. The artwork and sound were very well woven together although with it being a earlier release, the graphics aren&#039;t at the quality they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7957">
        are now.<br />
<br />
The character and enjoyment are what make this anime a 9 in my books, with plenty of laughter and a compelling character plot, you will not have any situations of boredom.

    I couldn&#039;t resist picking up this book, let alone watching the anime afterwards. I mean, it&#039;s not everyday you discover a book about a miniature girl taking over a guy&#039;s right hand. <br />
<br />
This is one of those types of anime&#039;s where you can&#039;t help but giggle at all the strange situations he has to face due to his physically attached partner, Midori. The more he tries to keep his predicament, the more situations are thrown his way threating to have him and little Midori exposed. Even some guys might find this anime quite fascinating if they just give it a shot. My brother isn&#039;t one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172057">
        for chick flicks or girly stuff, but he actually loved this anime and the book.<br />
<br />
The art and animations were really enjoyable in my opinion. The facial expressions were hilarious, adorable, and everything inbetween, just when they needed to be. I loved the artists work and actually paused multiple scenes to take everything in.  Just beware...there is a little boobage. For mature eyes only.<br />
<br />
The music was great. I loved the soundtrack. <br />
<br />
The characters each had their own distinct personalities, and for me that made all the difference. No bland characters. No unrealistic traits. Except maybe Midori&#039;s personality while she&#039;s on Seiji&#039;s hand. But in reality that is supposed to reflect Midori&#039;s thoughts rather than her actions. Everything she wishes she could say, do, and such are portrayed through little Midori while she takes over Seiji&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this drama. I can&#039;t recall a single moment of being bored or disappointed. There&#039;s enough going on to keep you entertained and watching.<br />
<br />
Overall, I thought it was an adorably funny anime and I can definitely see myself watching it again down the road.

    Midori no Hibi is about a shy girl named Midori who has secretly been in love with Seiji for a long time. One day she gets sick and falls into a deep sleep, only to wake up as Seiji&#039;s right hand...literally. And as you can imagine, the hilarity ensues. <br />
<br />
Only a couple episodes are dull. Other than that, the enjoyment of each episode is pretty consistent. The same can be said about the comedy: Midori no Hibi always remains in a comedic, light-hearted mood; only getting serious when it is needed to progress the story, not as an excuse to take a break, like some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review857">
        other animes do.<br />
<br />
So have fun, and enjoy watching this anime. You&#039;ll laugh in every episode, except maybe the last one... I didn&#039;t get to see the ending credits because I was crying through the whole thing.

    I just want to say that this is a beautiful series. The love that Midori has for Seiji is amazing. She truly loves him with all her heart. My only 2 problems with the series is that 1) He never said &quot;I love you&quot; to Midori or even showed any signs of falling in love with her. Yeah technically he got depressed towards the end and showed some signs of questioning why he could easily say I love you to other girls but not Midori but still I wanted to see breaks where he would stop and look at her and say &quot;Wow. She really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51597">
        loves me. She&#039;s really cute. I could really fall for her if she wasn&#039;t my right hand&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also 2) I didn&#039;t like how when Midori returned to her body Seiji acted as if her love for him dissapeared. She has loved him for years before she became his right hand. Just go visit her and tell her how you feel. She LOVES YOU more then anything. Guaranteed success my friend.<br />
<br />
However when I write this I realized that he was torn and confused about his true feelings for her, but as always he finally came to realize that he truly fell in love with Midori.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10. Story is pretty and sweet. These 2 buddies get into all sorts of shenanigans from school -&gt; gang fights. It&#039;s a little stale but Midori&#039;s love and affection for him keep things cute and lively.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10. The art is dated seeing how it&#039;s 2012. But still, Midori is cute, that&#039;s about it though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10. Didn&#039;t really listen to the OP and ED BUT from the few seconds before I skipped them they seemed very powerful and cute.<br />
<br />
The voices are very nice though. Especially the delinquent voices (Sister/Seiji/other delinquents) When they say that Oora (idk how to spell it, it sounds very genuine and funny to me lol)<br />
<br />
Enjoymeny: 10/10. It&#039;s a very cute story about how a shy giirl&#039;s soul leaves her body to spend time with her crush and eventually show him just how sincere/genuine/cute she really is, and how she is the ideal girl that he has been searching for his whole life.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a great series. Please check it out :)

So you wake up one morning to find your crankin&#039; hand has turned into some chick who&#039;s always dug you?  Straight, lets roll with this XD  I wont go further into the basic story because a: there&#039;s a dozen reviews already here and b: you can look the hell up in the story synopsis for that if you still need it crowbarred in.<br />
<br />
The show has one of the more outlandish premises i&#039;ve seen in a show that isn&#039;t centered around pure chaos(a`la Abenobashi).  sure the original set up is straight out of left field but the show itself is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15739">
        well written, has very likable characters and can easily put a smile on the face of the most angsty of the broody-brood set.    The show has a fairly long list of good points and only a few, that i could find, of bad points.  <br />
<br />
for the good, lets start with the most important: IT ENDS!!<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but a good percentage of Ro-Co&#039;s(romantic comedy) leave you with an ending that&#039;s left open so as to not piss off too many fans who wanted a specific ending.  this show is at least kind enough to give you an ending.  is it completely obvious 10 minutes into episode 1 what that ending will be?  yes, but that&#039;s not the point.  this show thrives on its characters: put them in the sun and watch them shine.  Takamizawa being one of the best of the supporting cast.  He&#039;s obsessed with dolls and puppets and is the only person in this entire universe that can actually see the fact that there is a frikkin person on protag-Seiji&#039;s wrist, which really doesn&#039;t solidify your hope for mankind.  Of course he originally thinks she&#039;s a puppet to begin with and tries to get it naked so he can see the serial code so he can try and get one himself.<br />
<br />
After Taka, there&#039;s Seiji&#039;s neighbor&#039;s 10(i believe) year old daughter who&#039;s got a mad-on for him, as well as a girl from school who keeps trying to set up the perfect opportunities for them to hook up that always are explained in a way that reminded you of when the Coyote finished setting up a trap for the Roadrunner and would non-verbally exposit exactly what he wanted to happen before it&#039;s inevitable downfall.  I gotta admit, these fantasy sequences are flat-out awesome and even come equipped with title and ending sequences to cement the fact that every one of these people are bat-shit insane.<br />
<br />
the biggest problem i had with the show was that, no matter how awesome the characters are, the bulk of them just disappear after a certain moment.  loli-fest drops off the earth after her centric episode half-way through the series and Taka Kaiser Soze&#039;s after some chick runs after him like a fool in love, but at least that one makes a little sense since it can just be said that they were off making nasty, cosplay-rific, pimply(that&#039;s pimple-e, not pimp-ly), oily whoopie.  The sister character only shows up to scream &#039;boogadu-boogie&#039; every now again, steal all of Seiji&#039;s money and say something to try and get him and Midori together.  What made me furious the most is that the character of Midori&#039;s maid seemed like she would be an awesome character to put into the story some, i know it would be hard to do but it looked like they took so much time into giving her a personality to just toss it all in the wastebasket and go about their day.<br />
<br />
the only other bad part was some of the music.  i heard a trumpet&#039;s wah-wah waaaaaaah  a few too many times and was glad there was no chase scenes cause you just KNOW that Yakety Sax would cue up.  But, as for bad parts, that&#039;s about it.some of the sound bytes were archaic and they dropped some characters with no explanation.  But the goods far outway that and its hard to properly convey how well this show is put together.  if you&#039;re a fan of sight gags, cute and/or odd story telling and rocoms, i suggest you check this show out some time.

    After reading the shocking synopsis of Midori no Hibi you would expect a predictable and dirty comedy. However, it avoids making easy jokes and it focuses in making very funny situations in every chapter which are going to make you laugh a lot and have a great time. It is true that it contains some ecchi scenes, some of them unnecessary, but these don’t make the series lose its charm and innocence.<br />
<br />
One good point of Midori Days is its brevity. Although when you finish it you want more, more than 20 chapters would have made it fall in the easy way. Furthermore, there isn’t any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118087">
        psychological evolution from the characters, and in a long tv series, probably, some users would have lost their interest in the show (although Midori is adorable and I couldn’t get tired of her).<br />
<br />
In my case, the fact that Midori no Hibi was different to what I was expecting and that it offers a good content, have kept me stay hooked on it and having a great feeling after watching it. So, if you like comedy, teenage romance with a bit of drama and you don’t care about watching some ecchi scenes, I strongly recommend this anime to you.<br />

    Midori Days is fantastic! It takes a really ludacris situation, and turns it into a sweet, heartfelt and funny high school slice of life anime. <br />
<br />
This show is about a guy who cant get a girlfriend to save his life. He&#039;s been turned down by pretty much everybody at his school, and comes to the realization that he might die alone with only his right hand. Until one day he awakes to find a girl HAS become his right hand! This is another anime that caught me off guard with its really great opening and closing songs. Especiaully the ending song. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve said before in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31641">
        past reviews that Slice of Life is my favorite anime genre, and it still is. Because of really great anime like this, just a good story that follows the lives of characters living crazy lives. Aren&#039;t we all a little like that?

    So I&#039;m guessing that you&#039;re wondering...&quot;just what the hell is this?&quot;.  The picture above shows a guy with a girl for a right hand.  To fully understand this strange phenomenon, you&#039;ll have to watch this anime, but I&#039;ll be telling you in my review just how worth watching this anime is.<br />
<br />
Story:  The story of Midori no Hibi is as followed.  Seiji &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Sawamura is a delinquent high school student who is feared by almost all his classmates for his &quot;Devil&#039;s Right Hand&quot;.  He is a pretty strong street fighter, capable of taking down entire gangs by himself.  Unfortunately,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21026">
        his status as a delinquent has led to him being rejected by just about every girl he has asked out.  For seventeen years, his right hand remains his only companion *wink wink* .  However, he wakes up one day, only to find that his right hand has been replaced by a tiny girl named Midori, who has actually had a crush on Seiji since middle school.  What follows is a zany but lighthearted romantic anime that is actually very, very worth watching.  In my opinion, the story is strange but unique enough that its abnormalities make it all the better.<br />
<br />
Art:  I simply love the art style of this anime.  It is extremely eye-catching, and the character designs are either adorable or pretty cool.  When compared to the amazing manga it was based off of, the difference is little to none.<br />
<br />
Music: An awesome aspect of the series, the music is something else.  Like Ouran High School Host Club, there is only one opening and ending theme for this series.  However, both of them, &quot;Sentimental&quot; and &quot;Mou Sukoshi...Mou Sukoshi...&quot;, are pretty amazing and catchy.  The series deserves high points when it comes to the music, which fits perfectly with the theme of the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters:  To be honest, the characters in this series are fantastically done.  Seiji Sawamura isn&#039;t actually your normally oblivious male protagonist, and despite appearances as a romance anime, the fight scenes with him are actually pretty badass.  Midori is a very cute character at the beginning, but she evolves over the course of the series, and you get a lot more insight on her real self towards the end.  Other characters in the series fulfill pretty awesome roles, but I&#039;d hate to ruin them for you, so you&#039;ll just have to get to watching it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  This series makes you laugh, smile, and probably almost shed a tear right towards the end.  It deserves that spot on your DVD shelf, and it is very re-watchable, despite it being a short 13 episodes.<br />
<br />
In the end, Midori no Hibi represents a magnificent anime that isn&#039;t exactly your standard fare.  It is a heartwarming yet funny story that delivers in just about every way.  I present it with a 10/10 rating, mostly because of just how emotionally powerful it becomes by the end of its 13 episode run.  Still, the humor, awesome art and music, and pretty well-done romance should grab you just as easily.

    Why do we all want to watch Midori no Hibi? The answer is really simple. We&#039;re all curious where it&#039;s gonna go with this &quot;dude&#039;s right hand turns into a cute girl&quot; plotline. <br />
<br />
Well, I&#039;m here to tell you they went the boring route.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not that surprising - was Midori no Hibi (Midori Days) going to be 13 episodes of jokes about what men think of their right hand? Of course not, and behind that silly concepts lies a basic anime.<br />
<br />
The story doesn&#039;t make much- what am I saying? It doesn&#039;t make any sense. Midori no Hibi is somehow a show about romance, handled in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313255">
        the most annoying way possible.<br />
<br />
How many times have I found myself asking why? Why does Midori like the protagonist, Seiji, to begin with, when the only reason she knows he exists is that he takes the train on the platform opposite to hers to go to school in the morning? Why does she become his right hand? Seriously, can anyone tell me why?<br />
<br />
Seiji&#039;s backstory is... Odd, to say the least. I guess it&#039;s original that the reason the protagonist is a loser who can never get a girlfriend isn&#039;t that he&#039;s a hikikomori or especially unattractive, but... It really doesn&#039;t work that well, and feels taken too far.<br />
<br />
Now, to talk about the characters... How do I put it. <br />
I hate them.<br />
<br />
Midori is incredibly obnoxious, and being attached to the protagonist&#039;s body, she&#039;s unavoidable. Her reasoning, the things she does, don&#039;t even manage to make her cute or pitiful, for a simple reason; she&#039;s just an ungrateful brat. <br />
If only there were some reason she dreams of getting closer to Seiji so much, like some event he may have forgotten, or a tough backstory or family-life, it would for sure be easy to empathize with her, but there is nothing of the sort. She&#039;s in love just because, she&#039;s sad just because. <br />
She goes on to wanting for Seiji to immediately reciprocate her feelings, even though he never knew her before and by stealing his right hand (which he actually needs a lot, because his awkward plot of a life says so) she&#039;s being nothing but an annoyance.<br />
*Of course* he becomes attached to her! Why wouldn&#039;t he? He&#039;s an anime protagonist, she&#039;s an anime girl, can I make it anymore obvious?<br />
<br />
Seiji&#039;s... nothing special. He&#039;s really not as bad as he could be, likeable in some scenes and not as annoying as other characters or plot points in the show. He&#039;s awkwardly written, but isn&#039;t really a problem.<br />
<br />
There are other characters. I don&#039;t remember how long ago I watched Midori no Hibi, but I only remember three of them. One should be punished for his sins, the other should be punished for her sins, and the other other one... Believe it or not, I actually liked! She&#039;s Seiji&#039;s other love interest.<br />
Now, note that I would have complained that this guy doesn&#039;t really deserve girls fighting for his useless attention, but on the opposite of Midori, Love Interest n°2 has a *reason* to like him! It almost feels as if she&#039;s an actual character with proper reasoning. I&#039;ll say she&#039;s probably the only good character in this show, but it is to be noted that I generally like the trope she represents.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t even get me started on this show&#039;s ending. It was incredibly frustrating and, frankly, uninteresting. In a way, it even makes everything that&#039;s happened in around 11 episodes feel useless. <br />
As I already said, all you&#039;ll find yourself asking is &quot;why&quot; and maybe a few &quot;how&quot;-s here and there.<br />
<br />
You could watch Midori no Hibi and it wouldn&#039;t kill you. It&#039;s easy to follow, thankfully not any longer than it is, and is, at least, not particularly boring. <br />
The ending was what ruined everyting for me. It could have been a lot smarter, it could have had some interesting morality, but it went the easy though inexplicable route.<br />
Midori no Hibi wasn&#039;t even that bad to watch, except for the times Midori would annoy me to no end, or Seiji would be so clueless it wasn&#039;t even funny anymore. I simply feel like I&#039;ve gained nothing out of watching it, and I feel like constant jokes about women and right hands wouldn&#039;t have been as insulting to womanhood as Midori&#039;s personality.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes have a few humourous scenes but they unfortunately fade away as the show starts taking itself too seriously.

    MIDORI DAYS, at the beginning was a shōnen fantasy manga by Kazurou Inoue and run for two years (Sep. 2002-Nov. 2004) and was released in the States by Viz Media.  The title in Japanese, Midori no Hibi (美鳥の日々), is translated as “Green Days” since —midori 緑 is a homophone for the Japanese word for “green’, which you’ll get due to Midori’s hair. It’s green, get it?<br />
<br />
The anime adaptation consists of 13 episodes (April 2004-June 2004) but strangely it ended before the manga series did.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plot starts out with Seiji “Mad Dog” Sawamura, who is the toughest student in high school but he does not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review60525">
        have the best reputation with everyone, even though, he fights for the weaker students against bullies and yet, every girl feared him and he does make him a bit sad and lonely that he suffers from a gift and a curse. Meanwhile, one girl by the name of Midori Kusagano, a shy girl who admires Seiji from afar but hasn’t got the courage to confess her love for him but when Seiji whines about not having a girlfriend and not wanting to die alone, suddenly, he got his wish……..but not in a good way. Him and Midori finally meet face to face, or is it face to hand? But I got one question about this.<br />
<br />
HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN AGAIN? IT IS MAGIC? DRUGS?  ILLUSIONS GONE WRONG? TOO MUCH GANJA? THE POWER OF LOVE? This series doesn’t exactly answer that but it did answer that the real Midori is under a coma and has no way of waking up.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the characters, well, most of the time they either screaming or panicking too much, which would be a normal thing if you see a human being on your arm but it gets into stir crazy results. Seiji is a character that I could relate to with his situation and can be enjoyable to watch but he seems, at first, not to get that he got his wish but he just say it wrong. Midori has that cue Moe girl personality and it might bother most people who get easily irritated by that but for me, she was average at some times but can irk you a bit. However, two other women in the series got on my nerves a bit. First, Takato Ayase…….yeah, I don’t like her at all. First, she act snobbish toward Seiji for being a delinquent, even though it’s total bullshit, and yet after he saves her from being gangraped and even though she has a crush on him, too, she still treats him like shit (most of the time but warm up to him at some times) and his sister, O-Rin, who enjoys drinking, beating up her little brother and taking his allowance, but he spends it on porn anyway so she’s doing him a favor. At first, I didn’t like her but I eventually didn’t mind her presence. There is also Osamu Miyahara, who idolizes and the closest thing to a friend to Seiji, but he’s really not that important and the same goes to Shiori, a 10-year-old girl who also has a crush on Seiji but she might as well hold a neon sign that says “Chris Hansen can’t wait to meet you.” Also, the strangest character in the series, Shuichi Takamizawa, a doll otaku with the overall creepy obsession and becomes very interested in Midori in her doll form. Last, there is a cat in this. He’s not that important. Moving on……..<br />
<br />
<br />
The animation is a bit appealing but it’s also clownish at a few times and overall “meh” and I hope you like the amount of fanservice thrown on, such as bare breasts, from almost every main female character (Rin, Takako and especially Midori). It can get excessively amusing but annoying at the same time. But then again, I forget that “pierrot” in Studio Pierrot means “clown” in French and yes, I know of one of their previous works, the one that ends to end already.  The music, I’m just not that much into this much saccharine J-Pop and it does fit the mood into the series and it works.<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT: It really wasn’t the anime for me. The comedy did work at a few times, I really gotten interested in the characters but in the end, it was something you would rent but you think twice before buying.

    This anime is a pretty good romance but in the side it does have some action in it.  This is one anime that I have always liked and had to re-watch it since it is very nice.<br />
<br />
I am known not to read synopsis of animes and this is one of the first romances that I watched and I didn&#039;t read it then.  But the general gist of the anime does come from a synopsis so if you want read that, I don&#039;t need to tell you what this anime is about.<br />
<br />
This is a romance anime and I think it is done pretty well.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37043">
         Draws two people together and a strange way and they get closer together as the anime progresses.  Though there are some surprises in and around the main character that brings some conflict and sticky situations but this romance is a pretty telegraphic romance since we already know what is probably going to end up happening in the end.<br />
<br />
This anime does have some action in it since the main character is kind of a delinquent.  But this does not take away from the overall romance side of the anime and actually ties in the main character&#039;s personality and helps us better understand what the main character is all about.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a very nice romance/action anime.  If you are a mainstream violent action person, I would say this is not for you but if you are into romance types then this is one to watch.  If you are a die hart romance person, this is still one to watch since the action does not take away from the overall quality in the anime.<br />
<br />
Kept this review nice and clean for everyone so until next time!

    Midori no Hibi (Midori Days) is a... interesting anime. I find that the show is often bashed for it&#039;s odd concept and ecchi elements. But I think that this show is very enjoyable, with great characters, and a original, and interesting concept.<br />
<br />
The story of Midori Days is, as I said before. Very odd. The idea of a guy with a cute girl on his right hand, who just happens to have a crush on him by the way, very bizzare and strange. But I believe that the show is, despite being and ecchi, very sweet and cute. And it&#039;s just a ton of fun watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review167319">
        the two main characters relationship get better as the show goes on. <br />
<br />
The two main characters in the show are the best part about the show. Midori while on Seiji&#039;s hand is almost always full of energy and very cheerful. Though, when in her human body is increadibly shy. Her devotion to Seiji is insane, often getting increadibly jealous when he&#039;s around any girls. She is a cute character and fun to watch. Seiji, despite being a imfamous delinquent who everyone&#039;s afraid of, is often only doing it to protect the weak, as he remember&#039;s a time when he was weak and bullied. He&#039;s at heart, really just a nice guy who want&#039;s a girlfriend. In general he&#039;s a ton of fun to watch just like Midori. Unfortunatley the other characters I find to be no where near as great as the main two, Ayase, another girl who falls for Seiji after being rescued by him, to be honest, is a Tsundere and does not have much development during the show. And the episodes dedicated to her are painful. Shiroi, who is a ten year old girl, also has a crush on Seiji. But I really just find her quite annoying. Her episode dedicated to her also was not much fun to watch. The other characters don&#039;t get much screentime and development in the anime, like Rin, Seiji&#039;s older sister. Who appears in a couple of episodes to harass Seiji. Admitedly I do like Rin, I find her to be fun to watch. But she does not get nearly enough screentime in the anime. Midori&#039;s friend, Kouta. Is not interesting at all in the anime, but is much more interesting in the manga. Which in general, was better than the anime in terms of characters. As most of them at least have one chapter out of eighty five of them devoted to them, and it gives them alot more development. <br />
<br />
Story - 7<br />
Characters - 7<br />
<br />
Animation and Sound <br />
<br />
In terms of animation this show is nothing all that special. The backgrounds look nice and the animation quality is good enough. There were not moments where the show went noticeably off model, overall the animation Studio Pierrot produced for this show, while nothing spectaular, is quite good.<br />
<br />
The series music is nothing noteworthy, all the background tracks fit the comedic situations the characters are in well enough but are nothing i&#039;d listen to on it&#039;s own. The OP and ED however are quite good, despite being quite generic. <br />
<br />
Animation - 6<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Overall while this adaption of the original manga has it&#039;s problems, I think that it&#039;s still a very enjoyable anime. The two main leads are great fun to watch, the conept of the show is interesting, and the show&#039;s comedy is often increadibly funny. As I have said I believe this adaption has it&#039;s problems, but I still believe it is worth watching, as it is a blast to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
Overall - 7
