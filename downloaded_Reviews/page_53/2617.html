    I am a straight male.<br />
<br />
This show is pretty good.<br />
<br />
I initially wrote off this show after seeing the now slightly famous intro scene, but soon, a joke amongst friends turned into a marathon of the six episodes that were out at the time. Every week after that, I looked forward to Wednesdays, where I&#039;d get to see the next episode of Love Stage. At this point, after completing the series, the true question is this:<br />
<br />
Why did I enjoy the show to the extent that I did?<br />
<br />
I mean, it is quite normal for one to enjoy a show that is that is directed towards a different target

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159839">
        audience, (I.E. shoujos) and I have nothing but respect for yaoi and the culture, but me enjoying this would seem as a bit extreme...except its not.  <br />
<br />
What this show does well, and likely the biggest reason to why I enjoyed it, was the characters. I will say, I enjoyed the mere presence of almost every single character in this show. The first of the two protagonists is Izumi, the more feminine character of the relationship, and the youngest member of a family of world class entertainers. He has a dream to become a manga artist, however his complete lack of skill causes his family to worry to quite a large extent. Now, there is more to Izumi&#039;s wonderful eyes- His character is well developed throughout the show. We get to see all the trails and tribulations he goes through, whether it be with the relationship between him and the other protagonist, which I&#039;ll get to in a sec, or the constant tension with his family, who almost sees him as a lost cause.  Izumi certainly does go through some entertaining developments throughout the show. The largest cause of this is the other male in the relationship, Ryouma. Ryouma is a growing celebrity in Japan, being seen in commercials and dramas frequently. As the masculine man in the relationship, is it his duty to take charge and progress the relationship along, and this works to create a dynamic between the two characters that I personally found quite entertaining to watch. The other characters, while not particularly developed, certainly add to the overall show- They accentuate the protagonists, while at the same time, being likable. Characters like Izumi&#039;s brother, a member of a rock band modeled off the actual manga writer&#039;s brother, make for good laughs, as well as Rei, the manager of Izumi&#039;s family. The beautiful thing is, all of these characters are likable: you can relate to their issues, and actually care about what  becomes of them. When a character cried, I felt sad. When they were happy, so was I. This is the shows strongest point. All characters have their own moments in the story which makes for a good time. <br />
<br />
(Speaking of good time, I will warn that the show, while not a hentai, does contain its fair share of...*scenes* in it, so do be prepared for that.)<br />
<br />
As for the story, it is actually nothing quite special, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. Does it take risks? Not particularly, but for what the show is trying to accomplish, (Displaying the relationship between the main characters.) it is quite serviceable. Without spoiling too much, the show begins with a standard romantic, almost love at first sight affair, but quickly turns into a comedic tale about a yaoi relationship. The best part about all this, is that it is quite hilarious. The actual chemistry between the characters is almost more important than the story said chemistry is attempting to progress in the first place. Every scene attempts to have a funny moment, whether it be regarding the hilarity of Izumi&#039;s manga, or the conversations between him and Ryouma. So honestly, the story may be weak, but that may be the point.<br />
<br />
Technically, the show is quite decent. Animation is quite solid here. Nothing to write home about, honestly, but character movements are crisp, and the palette is quite vibrant, adding much to the style of the show. (I mean, Izumi&#039;s eyes!) Keen eyed individuals would notice some shoddy art quality on occasion, such as inconsistent character drawings, but this is a nit-pick at worst. Regarding the soundtrack, I would not likely listen to the tracks outside of the show, but they do serve the show well. Songs play at the right times, while the tracks do not stand out, they certainly do fit well with the emotions a particular scene is trying to emanate. The OP, but SCREEN mode, fits in very well with the show. These guys are fairly new to the anime scene, and I do hope to hear them featured in more shows down the road. The ED is slightly less appealing to me, but still works quite well.<br />
<br />
So yeah, Love Stage. This is the first yaoi show that I&#039;ve every completed, and while I do not believe that I&#039;ll be actively searching for more in the genre, I would be lying if I say I did not enjoy this show. The show is only 10 episodes, and while the length did not hurt the show, I definitely believe that it would have slightly benefited from the extra two episodes, for developmental reasons which you will likely see. Nonetheless, I&#039;d  recommend it. Go watch it, you will invested in the characters, feel their emotions, and...yeah I still cant believe I watched a yaoi.<br />
<br />
Have fun.

    Happy LGBTQ+ Pride Month! In celebration, I’m reviewing one of the most beloved Shounen-ai anime from 2014. Love Stage!!<br />
<br />
...<br />
…<br />
…<br />
<br />
*Trigger warnings: Homophobia, transphobia, sexual assault, victim-blaming.*<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, your average ~straight~ teenage boy awakens from his bed and greets his idol, Lala Lulu. Izumi, the boy in question, lives with his family of actors and musicians. They constantly put pressure on him to become an entertainer, to his dismay. Izumi is an introverted otaku who dreams of becoming a famous mangaka. Despite wanting to move in a separate direction, he is dragged into showbiz by his family. When I first watched Love Stage as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401058">
        teen, I thought this would be a coming-of-age story about a boy who achieves his dreams and embraces his sexuality. Oh, how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Ten years ago, Izumi starred in a wedding commercial with Ryouma Ishijou, a now-famous actor. Back then, he played a girl due to his feminine features. When they first met, Ryouma fell in love with Izumi’s femininity and beautiful eyes. In the present, they reprise their roles for a new wedding commercial. Once they meet again, Ryouma confesses his feelings because he assumed Izumi was a woman. The two believed they were straight, but their feelings are strong enough to kindle a romance. They enter into a complicated relationship in which Ryouma stalks and sexually assaults Izumi until he ‘becomes gay.’  This is all framed as romantic, cute, and sexy. After all, this is a boys love anime; therefore, it adheres to the most toxic and homophobic cliches ingrained in the genre. Note: Love Stage frustratingly never acknowledges bisexuality exists.<br />
<br />
Izumi is assigned the submissive uke role (he doesn’t get a choice). Conversely, Ryouma assumes the dominant seme role. In the traditional yaoi erotica, the seme is aggressive and creepy, Ryouma lives up to those expectations. Whereas Izumi is helpless when confronted with emotional and sexual abuse. Ryouma stalks Izumi at school and home by manipulating his family’s trust, as a child groomer would. When Izumi finally calls Ryouma a creep, he apologizes profusely, guilt-trips him, then showers him with shallow compliments until Izumi forgives him. Of course, all that is manipulative bullshit because he kisses Izumi while he’s sleeping in the next scene.<br />
<br />
Mainstream audiences comprised of mostly straight men and women agree Love Stage is ‘pretty good for a gay anime.’ At the same time, most LGBTQ+ people strongly dislike it, as we should. If Ryouma wasn’t a “hot” and wealthy celebrity, no one would defend their relationship. Stereotypical portrayals of gay characters in anime have desensitized people to homophobic tropes since the inception of boys love manga.<br />
<br />
The absurd premise forces the ~straight~ men together like two north-pole magnets. Rather than developing a realistic romance like Given and Bloom Into You, it panders to the lowest common denominator with romanticized homophobia. Including both men being disgusted upon realizing they kissed a man. Ryouma insults Izumi for being a “Cross-dressing pervert” as if we needed more clues he’s homophobic. Implying people who try to pass as women are perverts attempting to trick men is also an argument used by transphobic people. There’s only one transgender woman in the cast—an unnamed hairdresser with a stereotypical transphobic character. She is voiced by a man in both the Japanese and English versions. Her only comments are to sexually objectify Izumi. The show continues to be transphobic and homophobic. Occasionally both in the same scene, remarkable! <br />
<br />
Izumi’s manager, Rei, is also gay. He is supposedly brilliant but frequently allows Ryouma to be alone with Izumi. Which often leads to sexual assault. Throughout the show, various contrived situations force Izumi and Ryouma together. The anime even pokes fun at these deus ex machinas. It is aware of how cliche it is but not aware enough to subvert cliches. Simply doing the trope repeatedly is not the same as parody, satire, or subversion. <br />
<br />
After Izumi’s first sexual assault, Rei consoles him by confessing his previous forays as a confused homosexual. He describes being gay as “A mosquito that needs to be squashed before it becomes a monster.” Rei pridefully claims homosexuality is a phase that gay people can suppress with effort. These are the same manipulative arguments homophobes use to justify conversion therapy: a variety of harmful practices that target LGBTQ+ people to change their sexuality or gender identity. It often leads to anxiety, depression, and possibly suicide. Not only is Rei’s advice wrong, but it is also dangerous and shows an offensive lack of awareness on the writer’s part. Rei is not a villain; instead, he’s framed as a mentor and treated as though his homophobic beliefs are valid. <br />
<br />
Izumi’s brother is gay as well, and he’s in a scandalous relationship with Rei. His brother has a not-so-subtle incestuous crush on Izumi and blames his cuteness for why Ryouma attempts to sexually assault him. Again, this is not targeted at the people who it’s about: gay men. It is almost fetishistic how Izumi and Ryouma reject their sexuality. Both make it clear they’re suffering from internalized homophobia, seemingly treated as a cute tongue-in-cheek joke. The only way you know they’re making a ‘joke’ is with the same goofy song and chibi art, regardless of how awful the situation really is. Homosexuality is treated like a dirty secret that everyone must hide, and they do. To the public, they are just “good friends,” and the only openly gay men are stereotypical predators (Including a scene in episode 10 when random men nearly rape Izumi, but it is played off as a joke). The only jokes that made me crack a smile were Izumi’s dream sequences about his idol Lala Lulu.<br />
<br />
The few female characters are shoujo stereotypes—screeching harpies who fetishize both Ryouma and Izumi. The only exception is Izumi’s mother, who is arguably worse than a non-entity because she doesn’t protect him from his predatory boyfriend and forces him to become an actor. His father is equally to blame for Izumi’s lack of autonomy.<br />
<br />
The art is what you’d expect. Like most boys love anime adaptations, it was made on a shoestring budget, with not much animation and very bland backgrounds. For 2014, it looks serviceable. The character designs live up to yaoi manga, thin guys with identical body types and abnormally pointy chins. As for the music, the opening and ending are pretty catchy. At first, the soundtrack distracted me from the appalling dialogue. Each background song was repeated over and over until it became mind-numbing.<br />
<br />
Love Stage is a repugnant anime, but the perfect example of everything wrong with boys love anime. It is stereotypical, homophobic, offensive, and it romanticizes abusive relationships. There’s nothing romantic about this bizarre romcom that seems to care more about condemning homosexuality rather than convincing us these two polar opposite men are genuinely in love.<br />

    This is now one of my favourite animes, this is my first review so bare with me, I&#039;ve never felt like writing one til i watched this anime. As a fan of yaoi/shounen ai this was a breath of fresh air as it&#039;s so hard to find decent animes in this genre because there are little to choose from and they&#039;re lacking in every department. <br />
<br />
This is a -absolute must- watch for fans of the yaoi and shounen-ai, but also i would highly recommend it for those new to it and want to check it out, it would make a good starter into these genres

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169571">
        because it&#039;s quite cute, nice animation, likeable characters, good development in only 11 episodes and also it&#039;s quite tame when it comes to the sexual things compared to other ones like Junjou Romantica, yet it&#039;s still enough too excited about.<br />
<br />
Izumi stared in a wedding commerical with Ryouma when they were younger and since then Ryouma has loved her..ahem him... ever since. Later they meet in a reunion commercial and Ryouma&#039;s love is releaved.. and so is Izumi&#039;s real gender, but that doesn&#039;t stop his love. And so Ryouma pursues Izumi. Izumi plays the Uke, he&#039;s very cute, and loveable i just wanted to squeeze him to bits. Ryouma as a famous actor I wasn&#039;t expecting him to be a such a lovable character. He was so sweet, caring and kind.. it was cute seeing what love does to him, he was the kind of guy I would want as my man. Overall I really liked them as a couple. The supporting charcaters were great aswell, especially Izumi&#039;s brother he&#039;s quite funny.<br />
<br />
Though there&#039;s only 11 episodes I was worried no way that&#039;s enough and I&#039;ll be disappointed cause it will leave me hanging incomplete. But actually it developed further than I thought in such the short time it was nice. Unlike other romance animes you have to wait for 24+ episodes just for a confession or even a kiss. I was excited for each episode and how it&#039;d progress next.<br />
<br />
The art was nice and especially the detail in Izumi eyes, so pretty. Only bad thing was lets say Izumi is walking down the street.. he will be detailed and everything but all the background people are whited out figures like ghosts or something which was a bit lazy. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s not really any music in the anime it&#039;self  other than the OP and ED, they&#039;re really catchy I would always sit through them, usually I skip through the Op and ED on animes and get straight to watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Only downside was that Izumi is a hardout fan of a anime La la Lulu which i found a bit childish but it goes with his cute character but after awhile it was bit annoying, especially that La La Lulu alarm clock omg lol. But it effected the anime to where there were La La Lulu scenes.. some which toke minutes that I had to skip and I didn&#039;t see the point of myself and just wasted the screen time.<br />
<br />
Make sure you watch the OVA aswell for a total of 11 episodes. Though i wish there was more - there&#039;s alot of potiental for 2nd season, though the 11 are still satisfying.<br />
<br />
Overall don&#039;t miss out on this anime even if you don&#039;t watch shounen-ai, this is a good place to start especially if you&#039;re into the romance genre. I tend to watch only romance animes and the romance in this anime was great it got me excited and fangirling on the other side of the screen. So give it ago you won&#039;t regret it :)

    As with any genre, yaoi/shounenai is often criticized by people who doesn&#039;t like it.  Actually shounen ai (and shoujo ai too) is mostly the same as ANY romantic comedy anime out there, the only difference is that the main couple features homoromantic characters, which tends to scare off straight viewers. <br />
<br />
The thing with &quot;Love Stage!!&quot;, what makes it so special, it&#039;s that for some reason it seems to have broken that genre barrier, and a big part of their viewers are straight male people who don&#039;t usually watch shounenai/yaoi shows.  <br />
<br />
The premise of the story is very simple: Ryouma, a famous actor, fell

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182049">
        in love with a girl when he was a child and has been obsessed with her memory since then, and once he meets &#039;her&#039; again, now as a young adult, he discovers &#039;she&#039; was actually a him: Izumi, a clumsy otaku with a showbusiness family. <br />
<br />
What makes it SO good is both the comedic value, because the story is tremendously HILARIOUS, and the characters itself, which are really very well developed in just a few episodes. <br />
<br />
The art is pretty cool, nothing out of the &quot;shoujo norm&quot;, but myself, i love the character design a lot. But i&#039;m biased because i really love Zaou Taishi&#039;s drawing style. <br />
<br />
So, i must say that if you are a fujoshi/fudanshi or a person who appreciates the genre just like me, this is a MUST watch. <br />
If you are a viewer who usually doesn&#039;t like yaoi/shounenai, or you haven&#039;t watch one ever, i will give it a try. Odds are you are going to like it... and if not, at least it&#039;s worth the laughs.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK<br />
<br />
Love stage is a Shounen-ai anime. Most of the male population really won&#039;t enjoy this but it&#039;s mostly for girls. The anime is really good and was enjoyable with Comedy, Romance, Drama etc...<br />
<br />
Story -8<br />
<br />
Story&#039;s pretty good. Izumi wants to become a manga artist. His family is in show biz and so they want him to enter the show biz world. Note that he is only in college. He is often mistaken for a girl because of his cute looks and such. Ryouma, our main male character number 2, mistook him for a girl when they had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review159869">
        to do a commercial when they were young. After meeting 10 years later, Ryouma still has feelings, even after finding out Izumi was a guy. Izumi struggles to draw manga. It gets rejected and gets into despair. I really like Izumi&#039;s character development through out the show. He slowly realizes his feelings for Ryouma and gets into show biz in the end.<br />
<br />
Art - 8<br />
<br />
Art is beautiful but there were times were the art was iffy but it&#039;s good overall.<br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
<br />
I love the OP and END. There both really amazing and also the background music<br />
<br />
Character 9<br />
<br />
Characters are great as well. A lot of development with Ryouma and Izumi. Shougo, Izumi&#039;s brother who is a musician, has some secret affair going on with Rei, the Sena family&#039;s manager. But no one really actually realizes it unless you really pay attention. Izumi&#039;s parents are side characters and so are his friends. Most characters get a development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10<br />
<br />
It was really enjoyable. It made me laugh. There was some sexual moments and they were steamy. The drama is good and they left us some cliffhangers. Romance is beautiful as well. Though no one knows Izumi and Ryouma are gay hehe. <br />
<br />
Overall this anime is great. If you&#039;re a yaoi lover than give it a watch, you&#039;ll love it. If you&#039;re a guy and watch Yaoi then I also recommend it. It&#039;s not as amazing compared to Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, but it&#039;s close. There isn&#039;t a lot of intimate scenes, maybe few. Unlike most of them that are M ;)<br />
<br />
So give it a watch, and I&#039;m sure you will like it, unless you hate Yaoi dont bother watching.

    I made an account just to write this review. I think this show is funny and light-hearted, which is great. But there is something fundamentally wrong in the basis of their relationship. One of the characters sexually assaults another, and experiences no real consequences. Then, the guy who got assaulted (Izumi), was pressured to stop being a burden to his family. On top of that, his brother ends up sympathizing with the assaulter because he cries about how Izumi will never forgive him. But Izumi does. THIS IS WRONG. The show completely brushes over the assault and it&#039;s consequences on the characters as human beings.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296016">
        It even goes so far as to JUSTIFY THE ASSAULT as a part of their relationship. This is a major problem in the LGBT community, and anime about the community. ASSAULT AND RAPE ARE NOT, AND WILL NEVER BE OK. And it feels really ignored and brushed over here. Ignoring that part the show is great, but this has such a negative impact on ACTUAL people&#039;s lives.

    I first heard of this show by accidentally coming across its opening somewhere on the internet. From what I saw, it looked like this show was going to be about a healthy, consensual, small-age-gap relationship, which is a relationship I still have yet to see in yaoi. I find it a lot more in yuri, but hardly in yaoi. The two boys were holding hands, looking into each others eyes and had smiles on their faces. They both looked happy rather than one looking sexually pleased while the other wishes he was somewhere else. I really wanted to see if Japan can actually make a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220171">
        show about a HEALTHY guy-on-guy relationship, and I thought this was going to be the one. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
The first couple episodes were highly entertaining. One of the main characters, Ryouma is coming to the realization that he has feelings for another guy, Izumi and is going through a bunch of conflicting emotions, considering he thought he was straight before hand and he, at first, thought that Izumi was a girl. <br />
<br />
One day, Ryouma goes over to Izumi&#039;s house. They start off with the usual awkward greeting. Then, Ryouma ends up chasing Izumi around the house and tackling him. Ryouma pulls his pants down and puts his mouth all over Izumi&#039;s lower half while Izumi is crying praying that this stops soon. Luckily, soon enough, Ryouma was caught in the act by Izumi&#039;s parents&#039; manager and was forced to stop.<br />
<br />
At first, I was glad that this scene was taken by the characters in a negative way. In the crunchyroll subs I was reading, the manager even referred to it as assault when reporting what happened to Izumi&#039;s brother, which I was really impressed with. In fact, Izumi&#039;s brother was ready to beat up Ryouma the next time he saw him as punishment for what he did to his little brother. I was even more pleased to find that Ryouma shortly thereafter revealed how guilty he feels about what he has done to a person he cares so much for and even apologizes to Izumi in the most sincerest of ways. I thought, &quot;Thank God Japan knows that rape is a terrible thing!!&quot; A couple episodes later, there was a scene that made me completely change my mind about that. <br />
<br />
Izumi went on for days without sleeping because he was trying to finish up a manga in time to enter it into a contest. As a way of strengthening their &quot;friendship&quot;, Ryouma volunteered to help Izumi finish the manga in the last couple days before the contest. Just after the manga is finished, Izumi collapses to sleep and Ryouma carries him to his bed. Just before leaving Izumi&#039;s room, Ryouma couldn&#039;t resist, but take the opportunity to kiss Izumi while he is out cold. He planted a short one and then was ready to walk out, then thought, &quot;well, one more wouldn&#039;t hurt&quot;. He kisses him again, and then thinks, &quot;Nah, maybe one more. Now one more. I swear, this will be the last one. No another wouldn&#039;t hurt.&quot; He ends up kissing Izumi all over his body and apparently it&#039;s alright because Izumi&#039;s unconscious. If I were in Izumi&#039;s situation, especially if I woke up in the middle of that, I would be furious. I stopped the episode in the middle of that scene and swore to never continue. I came out of it feeling extremely disappointed and in utter disbelief.<br />
<br />
After they showed one rape scene where they acknowledge that what Ryouma did to Izumi was terrible, they show another scene where he gets away with doing something not that much different. I never found out what happened after that scene, but I knew that it was either going to result in Ryouma getting away with what he did because no one was watching and Izumi was unconscious, which is not something I was going to like in the slightest, or that Ryouma does get caught, in which case, I can hardly imagine Izumi wanting to stay friends with him, let alone start a romantic relationship with him. <br />
<br />
Let me ask, do any of you know of any queer anime (especially yaoi) where the two main characters are in a healthy, consensual, relationship? I really want to find something out there that does. It would make me feel really happy to know that Japan realizes that gay relationships are not that different from straight ones. The only one I&#039;ve come across that has come to that realization is Aoi Hana (highly recommend you watch that show instead).

    This is really terrible in pretty much every way. A couple lessons the audience can learn that I saw, before I outright dropped it due to the content: (1) stalking is a good way to get someone to love you, (2) you don&#039;t have to work hard at something if you&#039;re conventionally attractive, (3) it&#039;s alright for outside observers to forgive the perpetrator of someone else&#039;s sexual assault for them, (4) being creepy, stalker-y, and constantly gaslighting your romantic interest into paying attention to you and doing what you want them to do is perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Ugh, I don&#039;t want to be that person, but really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370566">
        I had to stop watching this bc it was so gross. Don&#039;t get me wrong,  I love yaoi, and I&#039;m aware of and generally fairly tolerant of its more problematic tropes, as I recognize it as a fetish mostly geared towards women rather than a genre interested in telling compelling stories. However, this show honestly made me want to never engage with it again, if that was the content it was gonna be. I liked the characters and setup, even the fact that the characters met as kids and then again as teens, and even the gender mixup/reveal, but as soon as the main relationship started evolving, every subsequent step forward the protagonists took seemed to get worse and worse. I mean, at one point Ryoma (seme) sexually assaults Izumi (uke) and then when Izumi refuses to forgive him, he begs for forgiveness on hands and knees and then gets Izumi&#039;s, his VICTIM&#039;s, phone number. Ryoma in effect guilts/pressures Izumi into providing him an access point, so that their &#039;relationship&#039; can continue.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t even touched on the family pressuring their kid to join their family business at the direct expense of his lifelong dream. They are wealthy celebrities, surely they could afford a drawing lesson or two for their son? I just, I can tell it was a well-intentioned romcom of a yaoi, but it failed for me on pretty much every level possible.<br />
<br />
I will add here that I do remember reading this manga when I was much younger and not seeing any of the problems in it that I do now in the anime, and I suspect that&#039;s down to immaturity, so this may appeal to a younger audience who doesn&#039;t understand the implications/situations involved.

    allthough i enjoyed it this anime wouldn&#039;t have such a bad review for me if it weren&#039;t for the glorified sexual assault I would&#039;ve gave this anime a 7 if non of that had happened<br />
<br />
the story was bad too but it was still interesting but it was extremely centered on the 2 main charachters and on episode 8 they decided to make a weird backstory cake so they wouldn&#039;t have to deal with the other charachter. <br />
<br />
I liked the fact that some of the charachter come to terms with their seuality<br />
<br />
the art was good even though it was a bit cliche (big eyes , the

    So... Um yeah.<br />
<br />
Honest, this anime really isn&#039;t any good. <br />
<br />
In fact, I&#039;d probably go as far as saying it&#039;s actually bad. To be honest, I&#039;m kind of ashamed to even say I watched and enjoyed it. Is this what fanservice obsessed men feel like when watching something like Highschool DxD? I feel like trash for enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Well, if you like BL, then this is probably going to satisfy your needs. But good lord. Everything about this anime is implausible, silly and over the top; the story doesn&#039;t even justify watching it because the character development is just so mediocre. Still, I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Sigh.

    As a gay person, I found a lot of this show tropey/boring and some of it outright insulting. Yaoi isn&#039;t generally the place to look for great, nuanced representation of actual gay people - I&#039;m aware it&#039;s mostly fetish porn for a target demographic of straight women - but this one hit on every trope that particularly grinds my gears. Love Stage leans hard into the idea that gay men fall into &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; roles in their relationships with each other (they don&#039;t), and its characters are largely empty vehicles for blundering into tastefully-drawn-but-compromising positions. Like most yaoi, it features a good degree of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370544">
        predatory behavior from its gay characters, and stalking/sexual assault are core elements of its romance. <br />
<br />
The show admittedly looks and sounds better than most yaoi - not on the level of more mainstream anime productions but at least not painful to watch, which is the reason I gave it a try. That said, its quality ends there. The plot loses its footing after the initial &quot;gender confusion&quot; premise, and proceeds through a series of typical romance story beats without much deviation from a very by-the-book shoujo, except with additional sexual harassment and internal protests (&quot;I can&#039;t do that, we&#039;re both boys!&quot;) which evolve into stereotypical justifications (&quot;it&#039;s only okay if it&#039;s you&quot;). Though the show occasionally succeeds at being funny (I&#039;m not too stubborn to admit a few of its jokes made me laugh), there isn&#039;t enough solid character writing or unique plot ideas to make me care at all about what happens. <br />
<br />
We&#039;re lucky enough now to have dozens of shows with genuinely compelling, complex, well-written portrayals of LGBT anime characters (Banana Fish, Bloom Into You, Devilman, Zombieland Saga, Given, Wandering Son, even Yuri on Ice). If anything, Love Stage is a reminder of how far we&#039;ve come since the days when Love Stage and shows like it were widely considered acceptable. This show aged like milk. That&#039;s okay - now there are other, better options. I recommend that, unless you&#039;re somehow still living in 2014, you take one.

    Love Stage started as a romantic comedy manga by Eiki Eiki and Zaou Taishi. In 2014 our old friends at J.C. Staff, behind such titles as Yami no Matsuei, Hachimitsu to Clover, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora and a bunch of other anime I&#039;ve reviewed, started releasing an anime adaptation. Is it a romance that&#039;s worth your time? Let&#039;s examine it and find out. As it was Valentine&#039;s yesterday and this seems like a good week for some romance.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Sena Izumi comes from a show business family. His mother is an actress. His father is in theatre and his elder brother is the lead singer of a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240648">
        band. Izumi, however, doesn&#039;t want to be in show business. He wants to be a manga writer and artist. In spite of not being good at drawing. I know how he feels. That&#039;s why all my writing just uses words. Things change for Izumi when he receives an offer to be the bride in an advert that&#039;s a follow up to one he was in a decade ago. He initially refuses but finds out that the other intended star, Ichijou Ryouma, won&#039;t take part unless the casting is the same as it was a decade ago. Reluctantly, Izumi agrees to take part for the sake of his family&#039;s business. Little does he realise that Ichijou&#039;s insistence has to do with the feelings he&#039;s harboured for a decade and little does Ichijou realise that the co-star he&#039;s been pining for is actually a boy. I detect incoming hijinks.<br />
<br />
The biggest flaw with this series is that a lot of the early stuff involving the romance is questionable, at best. Ichijou carries around a picture of eight year old Izumi and he&#039;s been obsessing over him. That&#039;s pretty creepy. You&#039;d think a mentally stable person would have gotten over their first crush given a decade. There&#039;s also a scene where Ichijou actively tries to force himself on Izumi which begs the question of why a light-hearted comedic romance involves attempted rape. That&#039;s not remotely suitable for the tone. To its credit, the series does acknowledge the atrocious nature of Ryouma&#039;s actions and spends a good amount of time having him try to redeem himself but it&#039;s still really tonally awkward and poor form for the start of a romance. There&#039;s also some awkwardness involving Izumi&#039;s brother harbouring a complex for him that borders on incestuous.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, the romance does get pretty decent once its past the initial awkwardness. The comedic elements of the series also generally work pretty well. It&#039;s not uproariously funny comedy, but it is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
This series has two types of characters. The first are the major characters who are a step or two above archetypes. They develop, albeit in kind of shallow ways, over the course of the series. The second are the side characters who are pretty much the epitome of generic. The interactions vary a bit. Izumi is unrealistically quick to forgive Ryouma but their latter interactions after that whole plot point dies down are pretty decent and develop almost naturally. My favourite interactions by far are between Izumi &amp; Rei, a gent who acts as a guardian and parental figure towards him. It&#039;s a multi-faceted dynamic that can be genuinely heart-warming at times. Then we have the brotherly relationship which is far too clingy and a bit creepy.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artwork is, as a whole, pretty decent. The series does suffer a bit from the whole comedic undetailed moments that you get in a lot of series. The mouths are also a bit awkward both in how they move and in their appearance. I do quite like the way they do the eyes in the series, although the spectacles look awkward, and the regular scenes where they aren&#039;t doing something odd for comedic effect look quite nice. I also do like that Izumi&#039;s drawings are realistically amateurish. They don&#039;t make them look exaggeratedly bad like a lot of series that have a character who&#039;s supposed to be bad at artwork do.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The cast in this is pretty good. Eguchi Takuya, Hirakawa Daisuke &amp; Yonaga Tsubasa all deliver nice performances and the rest of the cast are all competent. The music was handled by Nakanishi Ryosuke and he did a decent enough job. It&#039;s not a soundtrack I&#039;ll be listening to on its own but it does get the job done.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve already talked about Izumi And Ryouma quite a bit but there&#039;s more homo-eroticism in the series than just the two of them. Towards the end it&#039;s heavily implied that Izumi&#039;s brother and Rei are in a sexual relationship. I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t do more that instead of focusing on the kind of creepy brother complex.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Love Stage is a series that has a massive shadow hanging over it. The shadow of the messed up way the main romance starts. And while the series does markedly improve over that very poor first impression, it never quite breaks away from it. Ultimately, those things it does well kind of strike a balance with those it does poorly. Is it a bad series? No. It has quite a few funny moments and the latter stuff with the romance is decent enough. Is it a good one? Also no. It&#039;s simply hurt too much by the tonal awkwardness in the beginning and by the whole brother complex aspect. In the end, it&#039;s pretty average. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. If you like romances and can forgive the whole way things open, you&#039;ll probably get some enjoyment from it. Next week I&#039;ll look at JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2.

    Disgusting childish and problematic.<br />
Another BL on my list where seme should have been arrested a long time ago.<br />
Okay, here we go<br />
The love stage starts quite interesting. We have a gender intrigue here, where the main character thinks he has fallen in love with a girl who is actually a boy. Sounds interesting enough? But the show will show you that such a seemingly ridiculous idea for a romantic comedy can be spoiled. When Ryoma learns that Izumi is a boy, he decides to rape him. Yes Yes. He&#039;s already getting started but gets hit by Izumi&#039;s brother&#039;s friend.<br />
After this incident, Ryoma locks up in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review390486">
        room and cries for several days. Then comes to his brother who knows Izumi has been attacked and almost raped. Only the brother says he has nothing to worry about, starts to blame him for not leaving the room, and it&#039;s actually normal for a guy to get horny when they lick his nipples. Brother doesn&#039;t mind the rape of Izumi. Better to blame the victim. Then Ryoma stalks Izumi, then apologizes to him. And they start dating. Dating your rapist according to the show is very romantic. And it&#039;s okay after that, but one day Izumi sleeps over with Ryoma and Ryoma, and while he is asleep, he starts kissing Izumi many times. The second scene is a complete failure. In the next episode, Izumi tells Ryoma that he can do whatever I want with him. Izumi is exhausted by this idiot apparently and his mental state is terrible. Ryoma kisses him and Izumi lies down, cries, and doesn&#039;t move. Ryoma gets pissed off and blames Izumi for taking advantage of his feelings. <br />
Another victim-blaming scene. Then we have the typical crumbs of life again, and practically nothing interesting happens except that Izumi understands that he loves Ryoma, so he runs to his house and on the way, a group of people attack him and try to rape him. Jesus Christ, why is everyone attacking Izumi in this show? It&#039;s disgusting. It doesn&#039;t come to that and Izumi says that he wants sex with Ryoma. Ryoma is happy and says he won&#039;t stop having sex if Izumi changes her mind. And towards the end, Izumi says that he has changed his mind after all and he doesn&#039;t want to and he changes his mind, but Ryoma manipulates him and says that he is cute and he wants to know more about him. It&#039;s disgusting. From this show you can understand that:<br />
It&#039;s normal for a family to forgive the rape of a family member.<br />
It&#039;s normal to stalk someone<br />
It is normal to tell a sexual assault victim that they are exaggerating and do not worry<br />
It is normal to manipulate someone<br />
It&#039;s normal to blame someone for your problems and actions<br />
It&#039;s not a show is a documentary about the Stockholm syndrome.

    Is no one going to mention how ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS NEARLY RAPES THE OTHER??? <br />
That ruined the whole anime for me. The characters are acting like it&#039;s not a big deal! It&#039;s infuriating!!! I will not ship a man who nearly raped another one WITH the victim. That&#039;s just fucked up.<br />
Sure, at first the older brother was mad, but he saw that the rapist was seemingly depressed the next day, and THAT got rid of his anger. BULLSHIT. How dare they normalize rape instead of condemning it? There&#039;s no warning that it&#039;s going to happen, either. It just RANDOMLY happens. I can&#039;t even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240369">
        think of a reason as to WHY this led to the man trying to rape the other. This scene is completely unnecessary and, my best guess, is only inserted for &quot;fan service.&quot; <br />
Assault isn&#039;t fucking okay. Stop trying to normalize it in the LGBT+ community. You won&#039;t see this shit anywhere else in anime.

    I know this is a really popular yaoi but it was not my favorite!! I think if you have the time, it&#039;s easy to get through the ten episodes, but it isn&#039;t exactly super exciting... I think other yaoi are ten times better. <br />
<br />
The ending, however, is very cute but also feel rushed. The music was really nice. I loved the opening theme -- made the show feel more exciting than it really was. The art was great! I don&#039;t have any complaints there.<br />
<br />
The characters were very one-dimension and I honestly found Ryouma to be super annoying at times. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day,

    I never quite know whether I should try to rate BL anime within its own genre or not, but since MAL makes no genre distinctions when showing top anime, it seems fairer to rate it as I rate all other anime.  But I will point out where it stands within its own genre.<br />
<br />
I am gay and used to read a lot of BL. Tip to North American audiences:  in these reviews most people use confusing terminology, so here&#039;s a quickie refresher.  BL (Boys Love) is what the Japanese call boy-on-boy manga and anime mostly written by women and mostly directed at women.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229573">
         Yaoi in Japan only refers to very explicit BL doujinshi (fan fiction), which are basically pornographic without much plot.  In the West, people tend to misuse yaoi for boy-on-boy romantic works with some amount of actual sex being portrayed, while some call romantic works without explicit sex shounen-ai.  Again, that&#039;s not the term used in Japan, where shounen-ai only refers to a very narrow part of BL produced in the 1970s and 80s by a specific group of mangaka who expanded very romantic, idealized, exoticized shoujo concepts to boys.  Do yourselves a favour and learn to call boy-on-boy manga and anime BL, that way you&#039;re in tune with the country that actually produces most of it, and it&#039;ll reduce confusion.  This anime is BL, without graphically explicit sex.  Here endeth the lecture  ;)<br />
<br />
Love Stage!! turned out to be a fluffy, mildly amusing, quite inoffensive BL anime.  I have not read the source manga, but BL anime is almost always less explicit than its source.  If you think homosexuality is a sin, don&#039;t watch it.  If the thought of boy-on-boy sex makes you a bit uncomfortable because you&#039;re a straight guy, I think you can fairly safely watch this without breaking out in hives.  There is clearly some sex happening, but it is stylized away in a rather imaginative way; nothing is ever shown graphically, other than kisses, and even those are darn tame; no lips as much as move.  I gotta say I especially loved the pink elephants, that had me laughing out loud.  Most of the humour is also not suggestive, and while there is some fan service, it doesn&#039;t even get close to hetero ecchi -- we get some naked torsos without nipples, woohoo. Most of the anime consists neither of lovey-dovey action nor of sex, it spends more time on Izumi&#039;s attempts to find himself, career-wise and romantically.<br />
<br />
Story 4/10:  Anime in general doesn&#039;t necessarily come up with believable stories, but the fluffier BL often takes the cake.  Ryouma, an up-and-coming hot actor, when he was a boy apparently fell in love with an 8 year old crybaby girl based on a single encounter, and carries that flame in his heart for the next 10 years.  Yeah, tell me another one.  When he has a chance to meet that girl again, he grabs it, and finds his love confirmed as the girl has grown up into a super-cute young woman.  Only, she&#039;s not actually a girl, she&#039;s a boy.  Henceforth we get the usual disgust upon the denouement from both Ryouma and Izumi, the cross-dressing boy in question, but love naturally conquers all in no time flat, without a whole lot of hesitation.  This is basically completely unrealistic on all levels, and because it&#039;s also thoroughly tropey, and one of my least favourite tropes are the stereotyping of seme/uke roles (sexually dominant / submissive), and the feminizing of the uke, I don&#039;t give it a lot of points.  Redeeming factors are that Ryouma actually tries to connect with Izumi on a personal level, and that Izumi doesn&#039;t get stuck in his panicked reactions but thinks further.  Still, it&#039;s all very shallow.  Most of the comedy wasn&#039;t funny to me, though I laughed at some of the visuals.<br />
<br />
Art 5/10:  I&#039;m not a big fan of Zaou Taishi; I find her mouths very unattractive, and her lines too heavily inked.  But it&#039;s all very bright and colourful, with lovely eyes in shades no human ever had.  ;)  The animation is decent for BL, not so much in general -- BL anime tends to have very small budgets and it always shows, though this is better than what it used to be.<br />
<br />
Sound 5/10: nothing special, neither in regard to music nor voice talent.<br />
<br />
Character 4/10:  Izumi actually experiences some growth, though it&#039;s minuscule. Ryouma gets over his initial disgust so fast it must have caused whiplash, but at least he didn&#039;t turn out as arrogant as he first came across -- never have I seen somebody kowtow more, which was interesting. The other characters are all barely there (I imagine the manga probably expands at least Rei and Shougo&#039;s roles, since they&#039;re obviously the secondary couple).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10:  I enjoyed it more than one might think from reading the preceding paragraphs, because the pacing was good and the characters were likeable, and I am grateful for any BL anime at all.  But I want to add something here for the reviewers who said:  &quot;yay, at least there was no rape or dubcon (dubious consent)!&quot;  You have been conditioned by too much bad BL.  There damn well was dubcon -- Izumi gets kissed many times without his consent, he gets nearly raped by Ryouma who only stops because Izumi is crying (though that actually tempts him too, which is a Japanese bullying trope I hate), he gets nearly raped by 3 strangers upon whom he comes in the process of a robbery.  On the plus side, the creators are at least not valorizing any of that, which is a step forward, but they&#039;re still playing it for laughs, and I can&#039;t express just how much I want BL to get further away from all the dubcon. Enthusiastic mutual consent is sexier than dubcon any day.

    This is going to be my very first review so please forgive me of any mistakes<br />
<br />
Anyway, let&#039;s get this straight. I DO NOT review anything, let alone anime, especially the ones that I really like, purely because the review is going to be biased and the review won&#039;t actually be helpful.<br />
But this one right here, took me by surprise. I actually took a break from watching anime around a year ago. I AM a 100% heterosexual male and it is weird of me to even watch an anime of such a genre in the first place let alone rate it this much. Done a truth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326992">
        or dare (anime-styled) with my anime-loving friends recently and I was dared to stop my break and start watching anime again with a genre straight males usually dislike (and I, am no exception). When watching the first episode I thought,&quot;Man, what a way to start watching anime again, huh?&quot; But, the story of the anime surprised me and started binge watching it<br />
<br />
Sorry that I got off-track. Now on you&#039;ll read a true review and not a background of why I started watching it in the first place ;p<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story. If I were to rate this anime based off of story alone and excluding *those* scenes that I personally find cringey, I would&#039;ve given it a solid 10/10. I am not going to provide any spoiler about the story at all. I, simply, am gonna comment on the story. &quot;Damn, if it were not a Boy&#039;s Love anime, I predict it would&#039;ve gotten a lot more rating and a lot more 5 stars&quot;<br />
As cheesy as that may sound, that comment is the only thing that comes to my mind when talking about the story. A romance anime with such a story is actually a good idea.<br />
<br />
Art style is fantastic. PERIOD. No question.<br />
<br />
Sound wise, the SFXes are always good in basically every anime. Not gonna talk about that. What are noteworthy (or in this case, review-worthy) are the music. Both of the songs played at the beginning and end of each episode are catchy and really good music. rating them below 10 is basically nit-picking.<br />
<br />
Ahh~ yes, the characters. How can I forget the characters? The characters , certainly are, well, enjoyable I should say. The characters are executed perfectly and make sure you crack a good laughter.<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, I definitely enjoyed this anime. This anime was nothing that I expected it to be. I really enjoyed watching this anime. The comedy aspects made me laugh.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really liked this anime and it is easy for me to recommend it to any Yaoi fan. Whilst also those that are curious about watching this or not, well you should because this is a good anime. PERIOD.<br />
<br />
P.S. sorry if my review did not seem good enough &#039;cause after all, this is one of the very first reviews that I&#039;ve ever written. I apologize once again for this review.

    Love Stage!! is a pretty good surprise in the BL genre. It&#039;s not incredible but gives us a fair love story and enjoyable characters.  <br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
The setting is common and overused in both shounen ai and shoujo manga, but it&#039;s not too long and unfolds well. Once you get into it, it can be pretty heart warming and has its inspirational moments. It&#039;s a relief that there are no dub/non-con in this story (and it is pretty sad that I have to mension this in my BL reviews).  <br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Pretty good for a BL anime, and still very pink. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
The opening song,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187683">
        LΦVEST by SCREEN mode is a cheerful and happy tune, not unlike every other j-pop songs you could have heard in animes so far. <br />
I admit it... I started watching LS!! because I knew Hirakawa Daisuke and Yonaga Tsubasa (respectively Rei Ryugazaki and Nagisa Hazuki in Free!) were acting in it. It was nice to hear their voices in the same anime again. Overall the voice acting is good.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 6<br />
The characters aren&#039;t especially well written, but they come off as funny and enjoyable. They all have a little something that makes them likable in the end, and it is all we can ask for. I especially feel for Izumi, the main character.   <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Yes! a decent BL love story! It&#039;s common and unoriginal but it keeps its promises.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
If you want to watch a cheesy BL story, Love Stage!! is a pretty good choice. It&#039;s short and nice. Don&#039;t expect a masterpiece and you will be pleased with what this anime has to offer. <br />

    Great series, liked Ryouma&#039;s coming-to-terms with an aspect which you&#039;ll realise once you watch the anime. The side characters like Shougo and Rei were great, and Shougo&#039;s comedic element made the anime all the more enjoyable with his protectiveness over his brother, although the relationship between these two could have been better explored much like the OG manga, but their involvement and interactions in each ep are still great to watch, regardless. One thing I didn&#039;t like as much was the fact that Ryouma seemed to be taken advantage of quite a bit in the sense his feelings were kinda played with initially, but the

        anime did take the same approach as the manga, so it&#039;s more a complaint about the latter, if anything. All in all a great anime.

    this is the first yaoi anime I have ever watched and  I want to admit it was very good. I thought that this anime would be uninteresting and the plot would be very bad but actually it was not. You may not be a yaoi fan but if you love romance animes you would enjoy this too. <br />
The story is about a major otaku Izumi Sena who just entered college and wants to become a mangaka like his idol Saotome (the writer of Lalalulu). <br />
ten years ago when he was 8 his parents were making appearance in a advertisement &quot;Happy Wedding&quot;. this was the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193199">
        first time when he met Ryouma. (The girl for the commercial couldn&#039;t show up because her flight was delayed, so Izumi&#039;s mother volenteered him for the missing girl&#039;s role. Izumi ended up doing the commercial with Ryouma, and ended up dressing like a young female. )<br />
Ryouma fell for Izumi because he thought &quot;she&quot; was a girl. After 10 years they were shooting this commercial again. And this was the time when Ryouma found out that Izumi was a boy but after this his feelings didn&#039;t change. He continued loving Izumi and even confessed to him saying that he didn&#039;t care that he was a boy he still loved him. But at that time Izumi didn&#039;t love him so they remained as friends but after a short time Izumi fell in love with Ryouma and they ended as a couple.<br />
<br />
maybe my review wasn&#039;t the best but the story is quite good. I would give it 8. Also the art was very good I liked it very much and I would give it 9. I enjoyed the opening and the ending very much too. Also I loved character&#039;s development. <br />
The anime had many comedy/romance moments and some dirty ( not too much ) moments which every fangirl (like me) would enjoy. So for the enjoyment I would give 8.<br />
The only thing I didn&#039;t like about the anime was that it was only 10 episodes ( I know that it had Ova too) but it would be better if it had more episodes.<br />
But I am a big romance fan and as my first yaoi anime it was quite very good . I recommend you this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
- sorry for my bad english. also this was my first preview so don&#039;t judge me-
