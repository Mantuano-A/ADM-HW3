    Kuttsukiboshi is a show ahead of its time. Outstanding in all fields, a true masterpiece. While watching, I only felt amazement and shame - my eyes are not worthy to view something so perfect, almost as if it was made for the Gods themselves.<br />
<br />
What makes Kuttsukiboshi so great, is that, on top of the gorgeous art, unique and stylish character designs, and orgasmic soundtrack, it has the best writing one could ever possibly imagine. The characters are so well written I know I could die for them if I knew them in real life. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61735">
        excitement, pulling you through countless ups and downs, while also managing to be something completely original, fresh. A new idea. <br />
<br />
Anyways I really liked this show and it&#039;s a masterpiece, if you didn&#039;t like it your opinion is probably not as good as mine<br />
<br />
10/10 best show of all time<br />
<br />
thank you<br />
<br />
(if you like girls having sex with each other you should probably watch this)

    &#039;Nothing worth mentioning. So you&#039;re gonna hate me just for that kind of thing?&#039;<br />

MAJOR SPOILERS PRESENT in order to give more analysis.<br />
<br />
The No.2 criterion for a review to get high helpful% is to avoid going against &#039;popular opinion&#039; among the targeted audience. Unfortunately, I am indeed going against the more popular opinion here.<br />
<br />
The rating is given from a more OBJECTIVE standpoint though. The enjoyment value for a yuri fan is probably around 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kuttsukiboshi is a yuri &#039;borderline hentai&#039; OVA. At first glance, Kuttsukiboshi may look very similar to the Sono Hanabira OVA which you can turn off your brain to watch. However, although Kuttsukiboshi has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187489">
        a lot of lovey-dovey sex scenes, it has serious drama throughout the latter part.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s sit back and take a look into the plot.<br />
<br />
<br />
--PLOT--<br />
<br />
Being an OVA, the plot is rather short.<br />
It starts off with a lovey-dovey pair of high school girls (the 2 main characters), named Kiiko and Aaya.<br />
The two spend a lot of efforts going yuri-yuri route in the school and in other places.<br />
The plot keeps going lovey-dovey until Aaya&#039;s brother appears and then comes incest and then the drama starts.<br />
<br />
To analyse the drama part, I will dissect the drama and split it into 2 parts:<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Part 1: Motives and actions<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s list all the key events that happens in chronological order.<br />
<br />
EVENT 1:<br />
CAUSE: Aaya&#039;s brother has a terminal disease.<br />
MOTIVE: Aaya&#039;s brother considers Aaya someone more than her sister, and has a dying wish of having sex with her. On the other hand, Aaya, for some reason, fails to reject this request.<br />
ACTION: Aaya&#039;s brother manipulates Aaya into having sex with him.<br />
<br />
Of course, almost everyone would consider Aaya&#039;s brother a jerk. But the main question lies with Aaya&#039;s motive: Does she even understand what it means by accepting her brother&#039;s request?<br />
(Let me clarify something a bit here: I&#039;ve said before in my other reviews that love should not be unilateral and possessive. But first of all, by &#039;love&#039;, I am not simply referring to love between lovers. Meanwhile, replace &#039;love&#039; with &#039;sex&#039; and this statement no longer stands.)<br />
Now, in my opinion, sex in its pure form should be when both sides consider each other a lover. But does Aaya consider her brother her lover? Likely not, her lover is Kiiko actually.<br />
&#039;To fulfill her brother&#039;s dying wish&#039; can not justify Aaya&#039;s actions. It only makes Aaya&#039;s actions more tolerable, but still, Aaya doesn&#039;t look before she leaps. We will see more of this trait later.<br />
On the other hand, to allow other people to manipulate her own life this easily? Pitiful, but not lovable.<br />
<br />
EVENT 2:<br />
CAUSE: Event 1 is blown, and the relationship between the 2 MCs faces a huge crisis.<br />
MOTIVE: Not properly explained, the most plausible explanation is that Aaya wants Kiiko to know that she loves her, and probably that Aaya could not stay with Kiiko for long.<br />
ACTION: Aaya has sex with Kiiko, forcibly. (i.e. Rape.)<br />
<br />
So what the hell is going on... Aaya wants Kiiko to know that she loves her, and she ties Kiiko up in a storage room and rapes her?<br />
There are AT LEAST 2 things that Aaya has done wrong:<br />
1, she should have at least tried to explain everything to Kiiko, and<br />
2, she shouldn&#039;t have tied Kiiko up: This makes Kiiko suffer even if Kiiko may get enjoyment from sex. I would never ever think of doing this! (Well, some may enjoy playing as a masochist, but Kiiko doesn&#039;t seem to. I don&#039;t think I need to further explain this tie and gag thing.)<br />
And there is one line that not only pisses Kiiko off, but also pisses me off (even after I finish the anime):<br />
<br />
(Kiiko: &#039;Aaya, what were you doing with your brother back then?&#039;)<br />
Aaya: &#039;Nothing worth mentioning. So you&#039;re gonna hate me just for that kind of thing?&#039;<br />
<br />
Bringing forward the question in event 1 again: Does Aaya even understand what it means by accepting her brother&#039;s request? Apparently, no.<br />
<br />
EVENT 3:<br />
CAUSE: The 2 MCs are separated, while Kiiko somehow knows the truth.<br />
MOTIVE: Kiiko misses Aaya even more.<br />
ACTION: Kiiko misses Aaya so much that her powers level up to Lv99. 「会いたい、会えない、思い募る程…」<br />
<br />
Without any context, the description itself would seem pretty fine.<br />
But this is actually where we should bring up the biggest problem in the anime... Which is the good old question:<br />
&#039;What is it that you mean love?&#039;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Part 2: Portrayal of love and other things<br />
<br />
Now, does Kuttsukiboshi depict true love in a proper way?<br />
The reason why Kiiko and Aaya can fall in love with each other is implied, and that&#039;s acceptable, but such cause is not enough to form a strong bond.<br />
And then comes incest and raping.<br />
For the incest event, it&#039;s natural to consider this cheating on her girlfriend, whether or not Aaya herself has realized or thought about it. Truth is, she seem to have considered this to be no big deal (Quote: &#039;...that kind of thing?&#039;)<br />
Then the raping: The fact that Aaya does not even care about Kiiko&#039;s agony stands. Do you call this true love? Do you call pushing your own demands to this extent true love?<br />
This sounds like the best way to prove your love is to have sex with your lover. Oh really?<br />
<br />
Then let&#039;s talk about the case after the raping.<br />
Some time ago I found a few comments on a yuri dedicated site named Yamibo, which gave me some good laughs. e.g.: &#039;Even after Aaya literally rapes Kiiko, Kiiko still loves Aaya. This proves how strong the bond between them is, and that is true love.&#039;<br />
Unfortunately this statement is flawed, as it is based on the premise &#039;the reason for Kiiko to still love Aaya is sound&#039;. But does this premise hold? If you were Kiiko, would you ever think of staying with a girl who would activate Maniac Mode at any time?<br />
It seems as if the anime wants to have Kiiko as one with some tsundere traits, but Kiiko is not a tsundere: She is genuinely pissed off when Aaya says incest is no big deal. But after that, she can not get over leaving Aaya.<br />
But... why?<br />
This is unexplained, and is precisely one of the biggest failures of the anime--it likely indicates that Kiiko can not get over leaving Aaya (and agrees to have sex with her later) only because her hormone triumphs over her rationality.<br />
<br />
The only good thing about this part, is that Kiiko does tell Aaya that her brother&#039;s deed is too brazen and unreasonable to be accepted in the end.<br />
But no character development follows, and the anime makes little further effort to address the heroines&#039; own problems and instead concludes that it&#039;s all Aaya&#039;s brother&#039;s fault. Well yes, her brother is a jerk, but once again, have you forgotten something like, say, the golden moment of the quote &#039;that kind of thing&#039; this quickly?<br />
What makes it worse, when the plot makes little effort to address the heroines&#039; own problems, it automatically delivers the idea that &#039;that kind of thing&#039; is no big deal, nor is raping as long as the one being raped is your (ex-)lover.<br />
<br />
Also about the ending:<br />
The ending could be interpreted in two ways, both of which are flawed in their meanings.<br />
One of them is that &#039;the MCs are going to live on that desolate planet for eternity&#039;. Sounds satisfying? Well, I was actually horrified when I got to know the ending.<br />
Why? Think about it: 2 people who like each other being together--good. But ONLY 2 people being together FOR ETERNITY--horrible. And they still feel good about it? Is it really worth it to give up everything and everyone else so that they can be together?!<br />
Even if in extreme cases--if nobody else really cares about them or whatsoever, their decision may in some degrees be explained, but still, the show is encouraging an unreasonable way to deal with dilemmas about love.<br />
The other interpretation is that &#039;they can come back&#039;. If interpreted in this way, then the two have simply found some place where they can spend time together and that&#039;s it. So what&#039;s new? There is little difference between having sex on a desert island and having sex in an empty school. In this interpretation, the ending is rather meaningless, and anti-climatic  as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
SUMMARY OF THE PLOT:<br />
<br />
The plot of Kuttsukiboshi actually reminds me of Gigguk&#039;s commentaries on the anime School Days, so I&#039;ll alter the wordings to fit this anime:<br />
&#039;Any chance for the show to be taken seriously is wasted by the constant use of sex scenes and all the unrealistic decisions made at the most crucial moments.&#039;<br />
What adds salt to injury is that the premise of the anime is potentially resourceful. To name a few things, there are superpowers, there is the symbol &#039;intertwined stars&#039;, and there&#039;s the manipulation thing as a drama device. And we end up seeing how they are either developed in a WTH way, underdeveloped or not developed at all.<br />
<br />
Now, being an OVA, these flaws are partly understandable because of the total screen time, but still:<br />
Plot: 3/10<br />
<br />
<br />
--CHARACTERS--<br />
<br />
Actually I&#039;ve covered quite a lot in the previous parts.<br />
Kawakami Kiiko: The more level-headed character, but both Kiiko and Aaya have some rather naive perceptions on love and other aspects. Kiiko is NOT a tsundere.<br />
Saitou Aaya: One who may easily allow others to manipulate her life, and one who doesn&#039;t think much before taking actions. Her perception on love is even more naive.<br />
Saitou Kouta: Jerk. Or at least too morbid after failing to suppress his accumulated desire.<br />
And there is not much character development.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor aspects:<br />
Animation &amp; Art: 5/10 (8/10 considering that it&#039;s entirely animated by a freelance animator) Not exactly good, but not bad either.<br />
Sound: 6/10 Rather appropriate, but not exactly memorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
--ENJOYMENT VALUE--<br />
<br />
Personally it&#039;s only a value around 5. But if you&#039;re a yuri fan, I guess I could give a value at about 8 or so, because even when the plot is very flawed, it may still look sweet if you just turn off your brain to watch.<br />
Still, I don&#039;t guarantee that this enjoyment score of 8 works for everyone, because you can still get pissed off by one or both of the main characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 3.5/10 (Not an average) If you&#039;re going to give credit for the fact that the story and animation is single-handedly done by an individual, I guess a score of 5 will do.<br />
<br />
ADVICE ON WATCHING THIS SHOW: I suggest that you turn off your brain and treat it as some hentai OVA: It isn&#039;t a proper romance story even when it does have a huge chunk of drama. If you treat this story seriously, you won&#039;t find it good.<br />

    Writing this review because I have absolutely no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. The artwork was a nice alternative and indie style, the soundtrack was fairly good, the voice acting was on point, but the characters and plot are absolute garbage. The people who made it seem to absolutely not understand human emotions, which resulted in two absolutely garbage characters.Throughout the story they just use each other for sexual fulfillment. They are only together so that they can fuck, and they are only fucking because they&#039;re both lonely and empty beings. The only thing that would dictate that either of them cares

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146355">
        for the other is that they say they love each other a lot, and yet both viciously attack each other on physical and psychological levels throughout the series. If you were looking for a pleasant romance in which two girls fall in love in the purest way, look elsewhere. If you were looking for a realistic drama in which the relationship of two characters is tested through hardships and in the end the outcome is one you can believe, look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Only watch this anime if you are looking for an anime about two girls who have not realized their sadomasochistic nature and who cannot understand the idea of human emotions. There is no love in this story. Only manipulation.<br />
<br />
That said, I rated it a 10 on my personal list in order to support the yuri genre ^w^

    Kuttsukiboshi can perhaps be attributed to a bench. You sit on it and wait for something to happen. While sitting, you are more open to the world around you, physically or emotionally. Usually, things transpire while sitting. And at times you ponder on what is happening. But it doesn&#039;t last for long, because usually you only stay on a bench for a small amount of time.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Considering that it&#039;s only composed of two episodes, Kuttsukiboshi&#039;s plot is pretty linear. It&#039;s understandable for something that lasts only a little above forty minutes. Instead of delivering plot twists however, Kuttsukiboshi brings shock, which isn&#039;t very common in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85423">
        shoujo-ai/yuri. The story is centered on the couple Saitou and Kawakami. Looking at them, you would somewhat expect that there would be a misunderstanding between them that pulls them apart. But the events that actually pull them apart were unexpectedly...appalling. The result of that: what seems to be cruel in reality, happens.<br />
<br />
At some parts though, the drama between Kawakami and Saitou felt rushed, as was their succeeding resolution. At one point, you&#039;d wonder &quot;what just happened?&quot;, and realize you&#039;ll never get an answer. Simply because Kuttsukiboshi was made to be simple, but often at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
Oh, and lots of love making. Not that that&#039;s a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Produced by Primastea, infamous for the Isshou Training series, you wouldn&#039;t expect much. Yet what looks to be flawed turned out to be actually acceptable. Although every scenery, person, love scene, or bench, doesn&#039;t live up to 2010-2012 standards, the style used gives the ambiance of a world isolated to two girls. That&#039;s pretty vague...<br />
<br />
Without looking at the deeper meaning of style, one can say that Kuttsukiboshi may have been done a little slower than a rush. Painted sceneries and objects look decent but look lazily done at close inspection. Character designs aren&#039;t the best; passable but unique.. One thing that may bother the viewer is the awkward smoothness of the camera at times, but can be overlooked. In short, it&#039;s not perfect, but at the very least decent.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The soundtrack is appropriate, as was the use of the piano. Calming most of the time. Not much can be said here.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Unfortunately, not much back story was given for Kawakami and Saitou. The benefit of this is that what is told to you is relevant to the story, so you aren&#039;t lead off-track. The character development was done in a simple manner: conflict, resolution, change. Although the &quot;change&quot; was in a way unimpressive and out-of-the-blue, it could be called &quot;sweet&quot;, considering that this is shoujo-ai. You are given little internal monologue and so you wouldn&#039;t know what led a character to such decision (although you can be assuming and just say, &quot;it&#039;s love&quot;).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
There are two reasons why I enjoyed Kuttsukiboshi. The first: love scenes that are short, sweet, and not explosive. The second: the &quot;shocking moments&quot; I mentioned earlier. It left my mouth gaping for at least half a minute. Depending on your tastes and expectations, enjoyment will vary.<br />
<br />
And so you leave the bench, wondering how what happened affected you. Kuttsukiboshi is, bluntly, not what you&#039;d expect (on a positive and negative note), but is definitely one of the better shoujo-ai anime there is.

    warnings: kidnapping, rape, incest, death threats, gaslighting, domestic violence<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much to say about this other than the warnings I listed. This was in my recommendations after I&#039;d finished watching a shoujo ai school comedy (Yuyushiki). Kuttsukiboshi looked a little more dramatic and it was short so I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to give it a try. Biggest mistake of the day.<br />
<br />
Most of the other reviews gave long-winded arguments about how watered down the characters were and how bad the story was—and I absolutely agree—but none of the reviewers sympathized with the fact that the characters were lesbians who became abusers after being abused. I&#039;m

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224432">
        sick and tired of lesbian characters being subject to violence for the sake of giving other characters depth, vomit-inducing storytelling, and/or purely sexual reasons (in this case, rape).<br />
<br />
The incest came out of nowhere and almost every negative review said &quot;well, she didn&#039;t have to&quot; or &quot;I didn&#039;t see any manipulation&quot; but he was  gaslighting his little sister into having sex with him. &quot;I&#039;m about to die and it&#039;s my dying wish. I saved myself all this time just for you. I won&#039;t force you if you don&#039;t want to but I love you and remember—I&#039;m dying and this is my last wish.&quot; Just because he didn&#039;t force her physically doesn&#039;t mean there was no manipulation involved. Capitalizing on diseases and portraying sick people in such a way is terrible writing and shameful.<br />
<br />
Kiiko and Aaya have nothing in common and the way the producers tried to portray intimacy between them is abysmal. There is nothing romantic about throwing someone against the wall, pinning them with brute force, and threatening to kill them if they try to leave. I want lesbian characters with depth, lesbian characters who don&#039;t constantly get abused or abuse another, lesbian characters who are happy being together. Kiiko&#039;s and Aaya&#039;s entire relationship is centered around abuse; there&#039;s nothing there.

    I think it&#039;s not right to tell it would be a sad ending since it&#039;s still on-going? This anime is worth watching and I hope it would not be a sad ending. The graphic is not that much to appreciate but the story has a lot of sense that made it catches someone&#039;s interest. I am a yuri/shoujo-ai enthusiast so I recommend this to all who loves yuri.

    I’m not going to use any arbitrary numbers because that won’t provide an accurate representation of what I just watched. Did you ever watch Boku no Pico and think to yourself: “this would be better with girls and superpowers.” Well, here you go; here’s Kuttsukiboshi in its entire implied sexual deviancy. This was probably the weirdest sexual adventure I went on due to the gratuitous amount of “Did you just say/do that..?” moments I felt during the course of this two episode odyssey (and because my roommate was sitting behind me). Now I’m not saying this to make fun of the series, because it’s not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190049">
        the worst thing I’ve ever watched, but it can be confusing when the narrative jumps from an affectionate couple to an incestuous affair to detaining and sexually exploiting a frustrated young woman.<br />
<br />
If that piques your fancy then you’re in luck, because that’s exactly what you’ll get in a concise, ecchi sprint of a series. Giving credit where credit is due, Naoya Ishikawa for directing, animating and writing the entirety of this OVA did well in terms of character design and movement (as well as one person would have been able to do with such a large project for an individual) so take it for what it is. It’s not your high-budget seasonal anime generic big boobed loli yuri fetish pandering smut (just wait ‘til next season), but it’s a good little piece to enjoy (or not) if you’re in between series. The sex is mostly censored, but you can paint the picture using the actions and noises during/after.<br />
<br />
Also, spoilers if I forgot to mention that. It’s hard not to talk about something so short without at least spoiling some elements of the story.

    Well, if you want a love story by two girls, forget it. At first episode, you would love this, but the second episode clear the target: fucked it. I don&#039;t understand how Japaneses and other fans of anime can love it. It&#039;s could be a classic of orange Yuri animes, but development is crazy. Feelings between they are confusing. Not like a girls stuff, but slavers mind. I don&#039;t like it at all, but the sound and art are good for this &quot;story&quot; by this release time. Anyway, run away for it with you want a show that relax you.

    Only episode one is out so far. I haven&#039;t seen a show of this genre before so I cant say I know how they should be done but just from first impressions I did enjoy it. <br />
<br />
The story is somewhat familiar but has some twists that make it different and worth a watch. 7/10<br />
<br />
The art is well done the characters look good and some of the environment has a style that looks like a painting example is the tree at the beginning of the show.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
The sound is good too the actress&#039; and the 2 actors (lol), I didn&#039;t find them annoying or unfitting for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29847">
        roles, there is no theme or opening and no much music. 7/10<br />
<br />
The characters are enjoyable but seem to suffer from a generic cookie-cutter appearance, I don&#039;t mean they are ugly just saying they don&#039;t have any distinctive characteristics.Their personality&#039;s comes from a template but  they do have some originality.  7/10 <br />
<br />

    *** SPOILER WARNING ***<br />
<br />
As someone who has read the manga one-shots by the author I wish I have never seen these OVAs, as they have ruined the whole franchise for me and I don&#039;t believe I&#039;ll ever be able to enjoy it again.<br />
<br />
Premise: the story begins as a typical demi-hentai yuri OVA with lots of fluff &#039;n&#039; stuff but by the end of the first episode quickly turns south towards an approaching iceberg via the means of one of our main heroines finding the other heroine shagging her own brother.<br />
<br />
Problem 1: now this could be some real quality material for a dramatic plot twist but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217803">
        it&#039;s done in such an unrealistic way that I feel physically sick. First of all the main heroine has no compelling reason or motivation of her own to actually allow her brother to bang her (some may disagree and say that her brother dying and having his last wish be shagging his own sister is quite alright as a motivational thingie, but I digress.) Think about it:<br />
 <br />
a) it would be one thing to actually go along with it if she were single but she&#039;s genuinely cheating on her lover, knowing full well that either she will have to keep it a secret from her for the rest of time, and doing so deceiving her forever, or tell her and call the whole yuri thing quits. Neither happens, she just shaggs her brother and doesn&#039;t even chase her lover to explain things when she discovers them, like &quot;what the heck can&#039;t be arsed to go after her right now, will deal with it later&quot;. <br />
b) all we are shown of the &quot;manipulation&quot; by her brother towards doing it is ONE single scene of his brother stating his wish in a VERY difficult moment for him (with his death being imminent in the background pulling on his sanity strings), which he REVOKES immediately when he sees her adverse reaction to the proposal. NO OTHER material has been shown depicting any sort of manipulation of coersive action towards having sex with him. If asking once is all it takes to break her mental resistance towards intercourse with her own brother in spite of having an actual lover, I feel disgusted by the very notion of such a being, real or imaginary.<br />
<br />
The disparity here is actually how little of a dilemma we see in regards to this event from the viewpoint of the brofo heroine with nigh no foreshadowing of the whole event in the first place.<br />
<br />
Problem 2: the drama that ensues<br />
Technically consists entirely of our &quot;normal&quot; heroine being raped by our brofo heroine. For no reason whatsoever, serving no real purpose other than satisfying the brofo heroine&#039;s lust. Being a human being myself, I&#039;d guess the priority here should be resolution on an emotional level but I guess japanese schoolgirls must be hornier than I could ever imagine or something. The bottomline here is, that there is remarkably little emotional depth to the brofo heroine&#039;s behaviour in this whole story. She neither seems sad, nor conflilcted, disgusted, depressed or in any other way emotionally affected by the whole event. She just goes crazy and rapes the other girl. Makes sense, right? Well, no.<br />
<br />
I dunno about everyone else, but I find it remarkably weird that she is completely unaffected by having had sex with her own brother in spite of claiming to hold no special romantic feelings towards him. Unless she does this regularly (i.e. prostitution) it doesn&#039;t add up on a psychological level. And don&#039;t tell me the rape thing is the rebound, it doesn&#039;t work like that. The &quot;normal&quot; reaction would be according to most psychological studies, very similar to that of being raped (sleeping with a stranger without actually feeling any inclination towards doing it).<br />
<br />
Not only is there no resolution on the emotional level, she completely disregards the whole event as if it were nothing. This might actually be a form of mental defense towards the whole trauma thing, but once again this doesn&#039;t add up on a psychological level because of her kidnapping her former girlfriend and raping her. I&#039;d say that&#039;d be a clear indication of a beginning mental breakdown, but as we&#039;re shown later no such thing is happening. I can only attribute this to a very, VERY badly written character personality.<br />
<br />
Problem 3: the interlude<br />
After being cheated on, kidnapped, raped, denied explanation, which in turn caused her relationship with her parents to worsen and caused trouble at school because of her not finishing her summer homework at all, she somehow still agrees to have sex with the other party of her own volition. I do not believe there would realistically be a human being who would react in such a way so easily and seemingly without any internal turmoil. So far our main heroine has been the redeeming character of this whole nonsensical trainwreck of a plotline but at this point, all the characters can go to shit for all I care.<br />
<br />
Problem 4: Finale<br />
&quot;SOMEHOW&quot; our main heroine sees a scene in her dream of what led to her ex-lover sleeping with her own brother. And that&#039;s supposed to be the resolution? Let&#039;s recap:<br />
- brofo heroine has still not explained anything to her ex-lover<br />
- brofo heroine has not even apologized for anything to her ex-lover<br />
- brofo heroine has left Japan for good without as much as saying proper farewell<br />
- brofo heroine has offered our main heroine NO EMOTIONAL closure on the whole thing whatsoever, and that&#039;s AFTER turning her life and mind upside down<br />
- in the dream, the brofo heroine has agreed to sleeping with her brother almost immediately upon being asked.<br />
- ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE REQUEST<br />
- her whole rejection consisted of going &quot;no&quot; and backing off once and then coming to conclusion on her own and offering herself in spite of her brother actually NOT forcing her to do it at all?<br />
- there is no way to tell when this occured. It could have very well have happened while she was already together with our main heroine, which is actually the likely case considering the circumstances (they&#039;ve been going out for a while at that point according to the story).<br />
- that would indicate that the cheating was NOT an impulsive action but planned, seeing as it couldn&#039;t have been consummated right after the dream scene seeing as the room design in the memory does not correspond to their flat from what I could tell<br />
<br />
This makes our brofo heroine a complete monster, seeing as I fail to see any sort of emotion, consideration or affection towards our main heroine, who is the one being faulted all along. And what does our main heroine do? She forgives all this just to have more sex with the other party. For no tangible reason other than the other girl&#039;s appearance/body? I fail to see any reason why.<br />
<br />
Story 3/10 - the first 3/4 of the first episode were alright, nothing spectacular but acceptable. The rest was irrational, or even downright nonsensical at many levels, the events were unexpected and without any proper foreshadowing in the previous events and overall made no sense.<br />
Characters 1/10 - the brofo heroine is a monster in my eyes and nobody can convince me otherwise. She does not behave the same way a human being with actual emotions should and it&#039;s downright creepy. The other heroine does reasonably well until the end where she acts as if everything was alright just because she understood the motivations for the other party&#039;s actions, as if that was enough. Don&#039;t forget that everyone always has some sort of motivation for their actions but that never, NEVER really changes anything in terms of what people actually feel when cheated on by the other party.<br />
Animation - 7/10 - considering it was done by a single person<br />
Sound - 5/10 alright<br />
Overall - 1/10 as it ruined a franchise I liked before for me

    Kuttsukiboshi is a short anime written, directed and animated by Ishikawa Naoya. The episodes were released in 2010 and 2012. Let&#039;s take a look at it. <br />
 <br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Kawakami Kiiko has psychic powers she gained in an accident. The only one who knows is Saitou Aaya, the girl she has a crush on. Fortunately for her, the feelings seem to be reciprocated. Unfortunately, there&#039;s some shit going on in Saitou&#039;s personal life that could threaten what they have. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story problems in this. The first glaringly noticeable issue is that Kiiko&#039;s psychic powers are a lazy plot device that only really come into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review416038">
        play in any significant fashion when there&#039;s some kind of situation that Ishikawa can&#039;t figure out a good solution for and he just resorts to some good old-fashioned lazy writing. The second obvious issue is that the romance in this romance story is pretty rubbish. The whole relationship between the girls is built on contrivances and it quickly devolves into an unhealthy, toxic mess and the issues that make it problematic are never addressed in any kind of meaningful way. Another issue, though less egregious, is that the ending sucks. The whole thing feels rushed, lazy and unsatisfying. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There are only three characters worth mentioning. Kiiko, Aaya and Aaya&#039;s older brother. None of them are complex or particularly interesting. But what really ruins the characters in this is that their relationship dynamics are very stilted and just badly executed. It&#039;s almost like the whole thing was written by an alien entity that doesn&#039;t understand human psychology or behaviour. I&#039;m not saying that Ishikawa is definitely a Zognoid, but he&#039;s certainly a bad writer. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The fact that this was animated by a single person really shows. The artwork and animation quality look like they were done by a sub-par flash animator. The animation is choppy and a bit slow. The artwork is pretty lazy in general. And I&#039;m sure someone is going to say that I should cut Ishikawa some slack under the circumstances but, being an eldritch horror, I don&#039;t do mercy. <br />
 <br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The acting and music are actually the best part of this OVA. That isn&#039;t to say that Imai Asami &amp; Isshiki Miku are good. Their performances are definitely a bit awkward. That being said, they aren&#039;t nearly as bad as any other element in this work. The music is just mediocre. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There is a lot of ho-yay. Lots of kissing scenes and the girls are blatantly having sex. So, if you love yuri scenes, don&#039;t mind ugly art and can tolerate a badly written, toxic romance, you may find some entertainment from that. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Maybe try observing normal human relationships even once before writing them. <br />
<br />
2. Magical realism elements like psychic powers can be fine. The problem is when they aren&#039;t integrated into the story well and when they&#039;re used as a crutch. Which is, unfortunately, the case here. <br />
<br />
3. While there&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with exploring a toxic relationship, there needs to be some awareness. This completely lacks that awareness. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: <br />
<br />
This may not be the worst shoujo ai work I&#039;ve ever reviewed, but it&#039;s definitely down there. Rubbish romance. Terrible characterisation. Poor artwork and just horrendous writing in general. My final rating is going to be a 2/10. <br />

    I watched this with a friend of mine. It was pretty good and we were so into it we both gave it a 10/10. Why? Well... <br />
<br />
Though the anime doesn&#039;t offer much because of it&#039;s lack of episodes. The anime does portray a small image of how strong love could be. And the fact that if it happens. It just does. Love can come in any form. Either forcefully or passionately. It&#039;s still a form of love. <br />
<br />
Tying up your girl and forcefully fucking her. Using power to pin your girl and fuck her. Bring your girl to another world and live together forever. Hahaha.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331814">
        Honestly this anime was pretty messed up we nearly dropped it but later on realized it&#039;s true art so we gave it a solid 10/10. <br />
<br />
The art was ok. The sound was ok. Characters were pretty hot. Story&#039;s ok but I&#039;d love it if it was longer. Overall ok hand. <br />
<br />
yes<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ve seen a review on here that put this anime at a 10, and that&#039;s honestly a crock of bullshit.<br />
This anime pissed me off so much to the point that I HAD to make a review about it. Why? Because I needed to vent this all out and get my rage out.<br />
THIS IS NOT A SPOILER FREE REVIEW. And why would you want to waste a whole hour watching this trash anyways?<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
Absolutely pathetic. In the beginning, it started out as a nice love story, but not a lot of things were connected. A lot of points were unexplained and they made a piss-poor attempt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210272">
        to connect things in the story even when they tried to develop it. That being said, many questions were left unanswered and the supernatural elements in the story did absolutely nothing to help it out.<br />
<br />
For some background, Kuttsukiboshi is about 2 &quot;lovely&quot; girls by the name of Aaya Saitou and Kiiko Kawakami. Kawakami has the supernatural power of telekinesis brought on by a car accident, as explained in the series. Does it make sense? Nope! But does anything really in this anime? Definitely not.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, Aaya is the only one who knows about Kiiko&#039;s powers, and makes her do &quot;experiments,&quot; which I assume she didn&#039;t exactly sign up for. Just like some other things in the series. But I&#039;ll indicate which section of this review is spoilers for people who don&#039;t want to read it.<br />
<br />
I felt as though yuri was thrown in here just for the hell of it. This could have been a very interesting plot to go along with, maybe Aaya blackmailing Kiito for some reason? And it turns out Kiiko is in love with Aaya and for some odd reason, they hook up about 4 times in the first episode. Ridiculous. No explaination, no reasoning, and no feelings were put forth. They&#039;re honestly just fuck buddies in this anime.<br />
<br />
HERE&#039;S WHERE THE SPOILERS COME. DON&#039;T READ ON IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH THIS TRASH. <br />
<br />
The plot twists in this anime were so lackluster and dumb that I honestly had to hold in my barf when I saw the &quot;ultimate twist&quot; that separated these two in the first place. So, in the first episode, they&#039;ve been hooking up for awhile and they constantly stay at each other&#039;s houses and pleasure each other in the library while Aaya is doing experiments on Kiito, right? All hunky dory? Not really.<br />
<br />
One day Kiito is on the train and realizes she&#039;s missing her phone and remembers she forgot it at Aaya&#039;s house when she last stayed there. No explaination to where she was going or how she even got off, but the next scene we see is in front of Aaya&#039;s door when she&#039;s ringing the doorbell. The door is locked and she uses her powers to get into the door. Not only is that trespassing, but literally the only practical use of her power ever since the anime started.<br />
<br />
When she goes into Aaya&#039;s room, she discovers her naked in front of her brother. It looks like they&#039;re having sex. At this point, I am so heavily disgusted that I sympathized with Kitto when her eyes widened in shock and she dropped her bag on the ground. Yeah, I know. What an idiot to leave her shit there. But I honestly understood because seeing the girl you evidently love making sweet incestual love with her brother that you idolize because he&#039;s a piano player is quite shocking. <br />
<br />
This is the driving force that separates them and this is honestly when I started to lose interest. But I pressed on. I believed this anime could get better and we could get some explaination as to why this happened. Would it excuse the fact that there was incest in this anime? No, but I still wanted an answer to the sin I had to view on the screen.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Kiiko is stupid enough to meet up in the classroom they always do the fucking in, and she finds her neglected bag on the counter and finds a note in it. It says &quot;You&#039;ll find your phone in the PE storage room.&quot; She&#039;s confused, and I am too. I had no idea what was going to happen, but I was soon to find out and be even more confused and appalled at what direction this anime was going.<br />
<br />
When she goes in there, she&#039;s hella confused, and I feel the same way. But someone comes up behind her and puts a chloroform cloth over her mouth and nose and she&#039;s eventually knocked out. When she awakens, she&#039;s tied up and scared out of her mind. And who&#039;s the one who tied her up and drugged her? It&#039;s fucking Aaya.<br />
<br />
At this point, we see there&#039;s bags upon bags of food in the PE storage room and the door is padlocked shut with a combination lock. Great. When she finds out it&#039;s Aaya, Aaya shuts her up with a kiss, and Kiiko keeps using her powers to throw things at her, and yells stop, and tries to get her off of her. But wow, guess what happens and guess what I insinuate from this scene in the anime?? Aaya fucking rapes Kiiko.<br />
<br />
And she KEEPS DOING IT WHEN THEY&#039;RE IN THE STORAGE ROOM FOR DAYS. D A Y S. SHE KEEPS HER IN THERE FOR DAYS TIED UP AND FEEDS HER AND THERE&#039;S THIS ONE SCENE. THIS ONE SCENE. WHERE SHE FEEDS HER SOMETHING AND KIIKO SAYS, &quot;Why aren&#039;t you eating,&quot; AND THEN AAYA SAYS, &quot;I&#039;ll have some,&quot; AND THEY SWAP SPIT AND FOOD AND IT&#039;S HONESTLY THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I&#039;VE SEEN IN AN ANIME SO FAR. AND I&#039;VE SEEN KISS X SIS.<br />
<br />
But skipping ahead and getting that over with, we find out the reason Aaya was doing it with her brother is because he was going to die soon and that&#039;s honestly the most shitty reason ever. She LET him rape HER. And now she&#039;s going around raping Kiiko and it&#039;s honestly the most fucked up cycle in the entire world and I am so disappointed that the studio that produced this even LET Naoya Ishikawa write this fucking thing. It&#039;s awful!<br />
<br />
And the end makes no fucking sense because apparently after she&#039;s treated like shit, Kiiko still wants to be with Aaya even after she LEFT JAPAN. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN FREE. But no, some supernatural bullshit let her be magically &quot;teleported&quot; to the damn plane Aaya was on, and then they land on this other planet bullshit and the cliches start rolling in and I wanted to kill myself when I finished this anime!<br />
<br />
Just please don&#039;t watch it. Whatever you do. <br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
I will admit, it is a different sort of style compared to everything else I&#039;ve seen, but it&#039;s not the greatest. A lot of animation in this anime wasn&#039;t fluid enough. It looked like a middle schooler in a beginning animation class put together this shit unlike a freelance animator. He could have done so much more to make this OVA be the best in animation, but I honestly think he did sub-par compared to masterpieces of animation like the scenery in Attack on Titan, or Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, for example.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
I liked the music, don&#039;t get me wrong, but it was overly melodramatic in certain scenes. The ending songs made it out to be this fluffy romantic shoujo ai, but in reality it&#039;s a piss poor attempt at making a yuri and it didn&#039;t do the anime justice at ALL.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
The characters in this anime are so one-dimensional, with no development, no purpose, no drive, NO CHARACTERIZATION WHATSOEVER. We never find out any motives of why the characters did what they did, why Kiito even liked Aaya in the first place other than she&#039;s pretty, why Aaya&#039;s brother was dying, OR EVEN WHY AAYA&#039;S BROTHER EVEN LOVED HIS OWN SISTER. These characters make me so fucking angry and they are the worst in my opinion. I have one word to sum this anime&#039;s characters up. BLAND.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
Now, I will admit, in the beginning, I liked this anime. I was enjoying the fluffy romance and cute interaction, and I wanted to see if this anime could get better, but no, it didn&#039;t. It just got worse and worse and spiraled my consciousness into the void. Nothing made sense, nothing was cleared up, and frankly, nothing about this anime made me want to continue watching. I was just begging for this to be over. I&#039;m glad it was only 2 episodes. Saved me from all the shit it could have been if it were, say, a 12 episode or even 26 episode series. <br />
<br />
Overall: 1<br />
I cannot stand this anime. This is honestly the worst thing I have ever seen in any type of media. This even beats Diabolik Lovers for me, and that is honestly the most awful shit I&#039;ve seen too. But this anime fucking takes the cake. At least the animation in Diabolik Lovers was good, and the music was superb, and the voice work was wonderful. This anime? Lackluster, bland, appalling, and overall just utter shit. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t watch this. Please. I&#039;m begging you. Watch something good, like Bartender, or Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok.<br />
<br />

    This is my first review so bear with me.  The only reason why I&#039;m making this review is because all the reviews for this anime are outdated and only cover the first episode.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The plot of the anime is fairly plain.  Girl and girl fall in love.  The best aspect of the story is that it starts quickly and keeps the romance and drama throughout the anime.  The drama is pretty well done, considering how the anime only contains 3 actual characters with important dialogue.  Also, even though there are 2 episodes, it paces itself nicely with every scene seeming important

          <span style="display: none;" id="review61585">
        and relevant.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
I read somewhere that the animation and art was entirely done by one person.  With that said, he did an impressive job by himself but the art cannot compare to some modern anime.  The style is very simple and plain which is good enough to carry this anime throughout the whole two episodes.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
Not much to say about sound.  I enjoyed the EDs and they were very fitting to each episode.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
I am a huge fan of character development and complex characters.  This anime offers a pretty good cast of three characters with each character being as fleshed out as possible within two episodes.  With that said, I feel like the characters weren&#039;t as appealing as they could be.  The viewers just see the two main characters as two girls who fall in love and have somewhat perverted attitudes and nothing more.  Perhaps if we had more episodes, we would have more time to acquaint with the characters.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
This section is what saves this anime in my opinion.  If you are a fan of yuri, exhibitionism, and multiple other fetishes, this anime will surely fill your desires.  There is fan service and implied sex aplenty; so much so that I felt like every other scene was dangerously approaching hentai levels.  Luckily, none of this bothers me and I thoroughly enjoyed most of it.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Overall, this anime was good.  Not great, but watchable and enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend this anime if you are looking for a satisfying shoujo ai or a controversial romance anime.  If they extended this anime to a full season, it could&#039;ve been as famous as Strawberry Panic among yuri fans, but it just seems a little too packed in terms of episode count.

    This show is goddamn retarded. Not because of the softcore porn, the lesbianism, or the incest. Okay, I lied, the incest was pretty nasty.<br />
<br />
Look, this show had great art and enjoyable music. It just felt like I was watching Teeth or the Human Centipede. In fact, I used this show in much the same vein. &quot;It&#039;s so bad, you have to watch it.&quot;<br />

    This is probably the most disappointing yuri I have seen in awhile.<br />
Sure it has kissing and sex- that is all great but the story plays like a hentai- except without the hentai. What I mean is you don&#039;t even get to see what makes hentai so great(sex scenes) and that is what is most disappointing about it. One of the characters  has a magical power as you may have read- but that is just there for--uhh... Not sure really what they were aiming for there but oh well.<br />
A thing I coulda rated it higher for was the moments where one of the characters would

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201019">
        look at their friendship bracelet or whatever and notice that it is broken. Rather than having it just zoom in on it and let the viewer soak in the info and figure it out them self they decide to say the obvious- &quot; it is broken omg&quot;<br />
The animation is average nothing notable.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: I still ended up enjoying the series, but I there is better out there.   If you just want to watch plain ol yuri and just not care go for it. If you came for the possible hentai then this is a pass as they only about show 5 seconds of the sex senes- nothing interesting added to it either.

    Warning: spoilers ahead<br />
<br />
So I’ve seen mixed reviews about this anime. Some people love it, some people hate it. I can understand both perspectives. However, since I watched this and enjoy reviewing anime, I thought I’d give my opinion on it for anyone who cares to listen. It should be evident from my score that I will not be recommending this anime, so if you’re a fan and don’t want to hear me hate on it, stop reading right now. <br />
<br />
Please note that I will be rating this based on my personal feelings. I do not weigh everything equally (Story and characters are weighed more than

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214338">
        art and sound). This is a biased review. If you want an unbiased score then, well, you&#039;re out of luck because there&#039;s no such thing as an unbiased review. <br />
<br />
Plot: 2/10<br />
The plot makes no sense. Now, if this was nothing but a straight hentai, that would be fine. You don’t need to have a plot that makes sense when the only thing that matters is how good the sex is. But this anime is trying to inject some drama into this. That’s what sets it apart from, say, Sono Hanabira (also Sono Hanabira is just better in general). However, the drama is forced and retarded. The main drama stems from when the main character walks in on her girlfriend fucking her brother. We later learn that she fucked her brother because he asked her to. But she knew that, were the MC to see this, she’d flip out. She knew she was being an idiot and betraying her girlfriend’s trust in her. And who the hell says “yeah, I know you’re my brother and I’m going out with someone else, but let’s go ahead and have sex with each other anyways. I mean it’s not like she’d find out.” You could argue that that’s just her personality, but the show tries to play it so that we’ll feel sorry for her. It doesn’t make any sense. And what about the main character? If she was upset enough to run away and not speak to her, then why would she just be like “whatever, it’s cool”. I mean, there’s literally no consequences for her actions. There’s drama and angst, but nothing comes of it. You would think that if you’re dating someone and then you walk in on them fucking their brother, then that would pretty much destroy the relationship. Anyways, after the main character runs away from her girlfriend some stuff happens and she ends up tied up in the PE shed. As a way of apologizing, her girlfriend ties her up and rapes her. Yes, you read that sentence correctly. And the crazy part is that it actually works. You’d think that raping your partner would just destroy the relationship further, but I guess the author has no clue how human emotions work. That’s the crux of most of the problems with this show. The author doesn’t have any idea how human emotions work. <br />
<br />
There’s one more thing I wanted to mention, and that’s the ending. If you’ve read any of my reviews, you’ll know that the ending is the most important thing to me. A bad ending can drop the score from an 8 to a 7, and that’s completely disregarding characters, art, and music. So what happens in the end? Well, basically the  main character discovers that she can teleport for some reason and then teleports to her friend. They have some heart to heart and then teleport to another planet and have sex forever and ever. But why can they breathe on that planet? Ignoring the fact that the chances of finding a planet that can support multi-celled organisms is infinitesimally small, there’s the problem of atmosphere. They should not have been able to breathe unless the atmosphere was the same as Earth’s. I personally think it would have been hilarious if the main character had messed up and accidentally teleported them to a planet with an atmosphere made entirely of nitrogen. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
The characters in this are so annoying that I would have dropped this if not for the yuri (I have a weak spot for yuri). Their actions are unrealistic, they have less personality than a wooden table, and they’re about as interesting as Kirito. And I don’t mean SAO II Kirito. I mean Kirito from the original SAO. What kind of person says “Yes onii-san, I’ll have sex with you. Nevermind that I already have a girlfriend. I’m sure she won’t care. And I can just make up with her by raping her”? And what’s up with the main character deciding that their relationship is now on it’s way to being healed because she was tied up and raped by the girl who she thought was her trusted girlfriend. You would think that that would destroy their relationship even further wouldn’t you? Even Sword Art Online handed sexual assault with more grace than this anime does. <br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The art isn’t that great, but it isn’t bad either. The girls are cute and that’s really all I care about. <br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The voice acting was pretty good, as was the music, but neither one of them was spectacular. I can’t remember any of them, which just goes to show how unmemorable the OST for this anime is. <br />
<br />
Kuttsukiboshi is an anime that manipulates your brain with fake drama and feels. It’s the kind of anime that you can enjoy if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the yuri. And I completely understand if that what you feel like doing. But if you really want to mindlessly watch some yuri, I’d recommend Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo. It’s about 100x better than this anime is and doesn’t unravel when you start to think about it. Unfortunately it’s not as easy to find as it used to be, since it’s been being removed from certain sites, but I think there are still versions out there if you look for them. <br />

    Kuttsukiboshi is the most unique yuri anime I&#039;ve ever stumbled across, so much so that I have mixed feelings over it.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
This short OVA stands out from the rest for its sci-fi aspects, seeing as our MC Kiiko has developed minor telekinesis. Cool right? However this isnt really the focus of the anime, but more the catalyst of the romance and the grand finale. I feel like this aspect could have been touched upon more often to up the anti of the romance and drama.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art style was very refreshing in my opinion, nothing too magnificent yet subtly elegant. The art really suits the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230045">
        moof of the anime well I think.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Very pleased with the soundtrack, kept the highs enjoyable and the lows inescapable. Also love how the ed music blends into the animation.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4<br />
The biggest downfall of this anime. Both Kiiko and Aaya are barely relatable as they dont seem to possess standard human emotion. (Unlike many other yuri characters from various other anime.) Aaya is, ehem... crazy, in some respects, whereas Kiiko on the other hand is as dense as a brick. Despite these girls being clearly retarded, they work verrrry well together. Somethin about them clicks in a way thats delightful to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Wow really? A ten even with all that being said? Funny enough I was immensely moved by this anime, the drama was top-notch, each scene being heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and the ending was enough to bring a tear to my eye.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
I cant find it in my heart to like the characters or the incoherence within the plot, but the quality and enjoyment were unlike anything Ive ever seen thus earning this rating. I&#039;d recommend this OVA to yuri fans for the experience alone, but to anyone else it&#039;s probably not worth your time.

    (Warning:This is my first review I made a account just so I could comment on this work.)<br />
<br />
               To be perfectly honest this mini series is definitely not for the light hearted or people with strong maybe even average morals. The first episode starts off sweet and calm in a way that makes you feel like a giggling school girl. Then suddenly the story take a extremely sudden left I don&#039;t know exactly why but something about it completely changes. There wasn&#039;t even a specific event I just suddenly started to fear

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205295">
        for the character. Now,  I haven&#039;t seen many yuri animes to get that weird six sense when you know just when stuff is about to hit the fan. I think that I can speak for even the most expirenced people that they were blind sided with how the story progressed.<br />
<br />
               What I find strange was that some of the things were predictable but it was just such a 180 from what we have already seen to really be a possibility. And then after the first bomb dropped all hell broke loose. Everything happens so fast that your brain can&#039;t even wrap around how wild this is. You&#039;re just constantly saying in your head &quot;What&#039;s wrong with you?&quot; &quot;Why are you okay with this?&quot; &quot;Why would you say that?&quot;. The story just lacks humanity in a way that made you feel like there was nothing wrong with it. At first I assumed that it was horribly translated and that the story could not possibly this harsh but alas that was not the case.<br />
<br />
                The story is honestly extremely bizarre in a way that makes you sit back and wonder what you just read. Now I have to admit the story was extremely rushed but it was a nice breather for when you&#039;re between shows. The story is a hit or a miss all depending on who you are I personally loved it and think that its a show you have to see. It just feels like it&#039;s a right of passage almost? Like Strawberry Panic or Sakura Tricks you just gotta see it, no way around it. <br />
<br />
               Now down to the technical stuff. I think the art was definitely on the better side of the spectrum, but I do have a rather large lack of knowledge. Personally, I wasn&#039;t a big fan of the girls appearances there was nothing appealing about them to me. I also have this thing where I don&#039;t like when they have like no lips just like a hole in their face. I also wasn&#039;t a fan of their eyes they were bleak and just weren&#039;t very apealing shape wise but thats just me. The art was almost lazy but in a way that was calming and beautiful in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
             I think the sound track was fine nothing really stands out it kinda just sounds like every other yuri sound track to me. The character development was half decent half atrocious. In the beginning I would say it was good but in the end the girls began to act extremely out of character that makes you wonder if you&#039;re watching the same series.<br />
<br />
But I honestly don&#039;t know why but I loved it. It was bizarre and weird in a way that left me fulfilled and I recommend it.<br />
(Please excuse my grammer it&#039;s three in the morning and Im falling asleep through my editing.)

    Alright, I just finished watching Kuttsukiboshi and decided to write a review and express my thoughts on it. Let&#039;s go!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
-----<br />
A girl named Kiiko gains some sort of powers after an accident we know nothing about. A new classmate of hers figures out her secret, and the two start having a relationship where they make experiments and test the girl&#039;s abilities and powers. But for Kiiko, her classmate, Aaya, is much more. She seems to be deeply in love with her. Well, their relationship progresses and they end up having a much more intimate relationship. The story revolves around this relationship of their&#039;s. There are very

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222172">
        ecchi moments, and one unnecessary and disturbing to me incident of incest. That&#039;s pretty much it. Don&#039;t expect crazy development or a very deep and meaningful story. It is exactly the way I described it. There are cute moments, and funny ones too. To be honest, maybe it was just me who found some parts hilarious...AM SORRY, THEY FRICKIN DID IT IN THE BUS, WHEN PEOPLE WERE THERE, ALRIGHT?! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY?!...Anyway, I feel like the story is decent and alright for a 2 ova series (Lmao, I said that the story was decent right after I said that they did it in the bus)...So yeah, I don&#039;t know if I am judging it too harshly, maybe. Let&#039;s just say that the story is from decent to fair, considering that it was a small series and the main part it wanted to emphasize on was their intimate -you know what I mean- relationship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art<br />
---<br />
The artstyle of this anime was very interesting. Quite unique I would say. I have seen it only in few anime and I am always fascinated by it. Great animation, and overall very nice art!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
-----<br />
So, I don&#039;t really remember giving attention to the soundtrack while watching the anime...I don&#039;t even remember if it actually had music on most of it...Some songs were pretty memorable to me though. I thought that the ending tracks on both ovas were great, with much dynamism! Giving the soundtrack a second listen, I have to say, its really nice! The voice actors did a great job too! Overall, I believe the sound was very good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character<br />
-------- <br />
Alright, I don&#039;t know what I am supposed to say here. This anime had 2 episodes, 20 minutes long each. I don&#039;t know how much development a character can have when given 40 minutes (xD, I am talking like the character has the choice). The thing is, as I said in the beginning, there isn&#039;t much development. The characters have a certain personality that doesn&#039;t really evolve or progress as the story goes on. The only thing that happens is that they acknowledge and express, let&#039;s say, their love to one another. This is the only thing that changes in matter of character. I feel like the characters overall were alright.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
---------<br />
I didn&#039;t love it, but I didn&#039;t hate it either. It wasn&#039;t something that I will forever remember and adore, but for 40 minutes it wasn&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
------<br />
It is definitely not the best or even one of the best anime I&#039;ve ever watched. BUT, it is not bad. Is it worth watching?...emmm...I mean why not. In the end you are not going to get a remarkable story or a new and unique experience, but if you are bored and have 40 minutes of your time, Kuttsukiboshi is a great choice! If you are into girl x girl romance i guess you won&#039;t be disappointed, and perverts could also easily enjoy this...Yes I just said that because its true. This wouldn&#039;t be the best choice for people who don&#039;t enjoy girl x girl love, because, as I said, it is full of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
---------------<br />
Overall: 6/10
