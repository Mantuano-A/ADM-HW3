    The original Prison School is probably the most impressive ecchi manga I have ever read. By impressive I don&#039;t just mean that it&#039;s enjoyable, but rather that it accomplished something that I sincerely didn&#039;t believe was possible. It manages to tell a story with hilarious comedy and incredibly lewd ecchi scenes, but at the same time also have a legitimately suspenseful and interesting plotline, *without* making those aspects feel incompatible. I don&#039;t think I have ever seen such a smooth and natural way of merging serious and non-serious elements anywhere else where it actually succeeds on both fronts.<br />

Now the anime covers the entirety of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199555">
        first arc of the manga, which tells the story of five boys who enroll in a previously all-girls boarding school which has just become co-ed. However, many of the female students are still disgusted at the notion of having men as their fellow classmates, and a certain vigilante organization within the school called the Underground Student Council decide to take the matter into their own hands. The group consists of the manipulative president Mari, the voluptuous and sadistic vice president Meiko, and the rather violent crazy person Hana who&#039;s also got a quite peculiar fetish to say the least. They set a trap for the boys where they manage to frame them for peeping, and consequently send them all off to live inside a small prison located on the school courtyard. And thus, their new life of hell begins as they are forced into manual labor under Meiko&#039;s relentless whipping, and they constantly have to be on their guard against the USC&#039;s foul play and attempts at getting the boys expelled for good. Meanwhile, the boys try to channel their inner Andy Dufresne as they start to dream about breaking out of prison...<br />
<br />
The first thing that needs to be said about this anime is that it doesn&#039;t hold anything back. Like not in the slightest. Among other things it features hardcore masochism, a principal obsessed with asses, misunderstandings about two of the guys supposedly being gay for each other, cross dressing, golden showers, a guy shitting himself in class, a girl who sweats about 50 liters per day, a myriad of sexual innuendos, non-stop femdom, epic speeches about the stupidest things imaginable and god knows what else. There are no breaks on this pain train and you better be prepared for what you&#039;re getting yourself into when deciding to watch Prison School, because it is rather... crude, to say the least. But crude or not, the execution is stellar, and it rarely fails to make you laugh with how blunt it is.<br />
<br />
The characters are all highly exaggerated in their behavior, but given the crazy atmosphere of the show it fits perfectly. Our main character Kiyoshi is energetic and dedicated, Gakuto is the best bro ever, Andre is a huge masochist, Joe is infatuated with ants and Shingo is an American delinquent. And of course they&#039;re all perverts, whether they admit it or not, but at least they&#039;re perverts with class... well discounting Andre that is. Speaking of which, the ecchi elements in Prison School are not to be underestimated. It has scenes you will probably never see anywhere else other than in hentai. But it doesn&#039;t come across as needless fanservice at all; rather it either makes it humorous or just plain epic, especially anything starring Kiyoshi and Hana in the same room is a sight for sore eyes. It&#039;s something you really need to see for yourself to understand. Of course the TV-airing of Prison School is censored like almost every ecchi anime is these days, but since the sexual content is mostly there for the sake of comedy rather than arousal I don&#039;t really find it all that distracting anyway.<br />
<br />
As far as pacing goes though, there are some issues. The anime covers 81 chapters&#039; worth of content in just 12 episodes, which is quite a lot of story in not too much time. As a result, the transitions in-between scenes are oftentimes done extremely quickly, which means that a lot of the jokes don&#039;t really have time to sink in properly before the story moves on to the next segment. There&#039;s also the fact that many of the characters actually talk *very* fast, which might just be another way of saving time. So in that sense it is a pretty rushed adaptation, but I think it gets gradually better the longer it goes on, and honestly even despite the fast pacing it still works out fairly smoothly most of the time. A few episodes more would have done wonders though.<br />
<br />
The manga is notorious for its unusually detailed and realistic-looking art style for an ecchi series, and the anime follows the same idea. I don&#039;t think it looks quite as crisp as the original art does, but it still gets the job done and gives you a pretty fresh outlook on the genre. The voice acting is also very on-point. Kamiya Hiroshi&#039;s performance fits Kiyoshi&#039;s character like a glove, probably because he shares a lot of traits with Araragi Koyomi from the Monogatari Series whom Hiroshi has also voiced. Seeing Hanazawa Kana of all people do the role of Hana might be a bit more unexpected though given her absolutely crazy persona, but she actually does an absolutely phenomenal job at it. I also have to give Konishi Katsuyuki a shout-out for his voicing of Gakuto&#039;s character; it was truly a special experience to listen to and a very impressive performance overall.<br />
<br />
Prison School is an anime with a very unorthodox combination of genres and styles, and an even rarer case of one which actually does it successfully. It stands out for its hilariously exaggerated scenes, its crazy characters and its ability to do literally *anything* without holding back for even a second. Is it a show for everyone? No, but I still think it&#039;s targeting a much larger audience than first impressions may lead you to believe. It&#039;s a highly entertaining series from start to finish, and while I still prefer the manga version, it&#039;s definitely an anime worth checking out, even if only to see just what the hell is actually going on in it.

    Prison School is by far my favorite anime this season! I&#039;m a big fan of Great Teacher Onizuka and it&#039;s the first time in years I&#039;ve had the same kind of enjoyment watching a comedy. I&#039;m usually not a big fan of over-sexualized female characters or harem animes but prison school is an exception.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
5 perverted teenagers end up in a school full of girls. They peak into the girls bath and get grounded into a prison set in the middle of the campus. These 5 guys are hilarious, one is fat as fuck, one is creepy as fuck, one is geeky as fuck... The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199597">
        girls in charge of them AKA the Underground School Council, bully them, torture them, insult them. This kind of treatment gives them boners lol<br />
All the comical elements that build up in the series are pretty similar to what would happen in GTO in these kind of weird sexual moments.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
The art is flawless. The action scenes are fast paced and you never get bored. Great attention to detail. Nothing bad to say about it. Character design is fine too and there&#039;s a lot of panty shots.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
eeeeh, not a fan of the opening or ending. For the sake of giving Prison School a 10/10 I&#039;ll just give the sound a 10. The voice acting is awesome though.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10 <br />
AMAZING. The 5 guys are funny as hell, the MC kyoshi is kinda lovable and cute while his friends are just creepy sexual weirdos. Since they&#039;re always stuck together they create great bonds and funny homoerotic quiproquos. The girls in charge of the prison are as fucked up as the guys.<br />
AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SCHOOL DESERVES AN AWARD.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
You will not get bored. I swear.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10 <br />
yep

    First, I’m going to have to say what Prison School is about. Because I’m honestly still trying to wrap my head around the concept and the hundreds of planning paper I bought at Office Depot isn’t helping. In some weird universe where parental absence is even more out-of-place than normal by anime standards, there is a private girls’ academy called Hachimitsu (not gonna dignify that name with a response) that has recently started to admit boys for no particular reason like some gender-reversed version of Zoey 101. However, Hachimitsu is an academy that’s far from being suitable for the Nick-audience viewing.<br />
<br />
It’s a harsh place where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200246">
        the most minor of infractions will cause you to get treated like a literal prisoner complete with wearing the stereotypical white and black outfits or face expulsion, which is something the five boys who transferred to the academy learn the hard way after making the stupid mistake of trying to peek into the girls’ locker room. Although why they’d want to is beyond me, considering every single girl in this show is less sexually appealing than Bayonetta in clown make-up. In fact, come to think of it, what exactly happens to these boys after they get expelled, considering they don’t exactly seem to be learning anything as is? Well, it turns out they want to stay so they can see a girls’ wet T-shirt contest that’s supposed to occur sometime in the future. Something I find very hard to believe actually exists in this academy - which is quite a feat considering everything else that goes past the headmaster’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Prison School is an incredibly difficult show to summarize because it seems like it was based on somebody’s Madlibs and the guy who filled it out was off his meds that day. I get that it’s supposed to be combining prison exploitation films with the standard “anime harem/school” tropes, but some things just don’t combine, like the Hercules legend and Michael Bolton. Every single element of the series is so contradictory to another element that I have a hard time trying to find out what I’m supposed to be caring about and more importantly, what I’m supposed to laugh at. So the vice-president punishing the boys for being perverted shows ample amounts of cleavage in school? These girls hate the male form and yet they’re open with showing their vaginas to them and the audience at every opportunity? There’s a guy who really loves ants to the point that he’d die for them? There is a gun in my drawer with a special mechanism that only fires the trigger if I’m pointing it up my nose?<br />
<br />
Oh sorry. My head was getting overwhelmed and I was thinking for a fast way to clear some thoughts. This whole show plays out like a South Park episode that was stretched to twelve times the length and stripped of all the life, memorable characters, great movie parodies, and subversive topical humor that still played by the rules even when it showcased a magician entertaining kids by sawing his penis off and hiding it behind a kid’s ear, causing it to fall into the same lifeless monkey cheese the shows it tries to parody fall into. Get past the presentation and all Prison School is is another goddamn story about the opposite sex trying to fit into a same-sex school and discovering what qualifies as romance in this medium whilst being about character types rather than characters. And unless you’re one of those people who really like over-the-top art styles, you’ll get tired of the presentation real fast.<br />
<br />
The humor relies entirely on overreacting, awkward situations that the characters narrate to the point that the joke overstays its welcome (which is any length of time above zero seconds), or just being nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical. And unusually for a Tsutomu Mizushima anime - and especially compared to JC Staff’s other perverted comedy that aired in the same season - the comedic timing is completely awful, so forget laughing. I know Funimation has never been above being a little liberal with translations, but poking the bear aside, I find it very hard to believe that video games even exist in this universe. And once that thought entered my mind, the shock chuckle I got from seeing that became like the shock chuckle of seeing a piece of wood stuck down someone’s sphincter: incapable of provoking an emotion from me other than confusion.<br />
<br />
As far as I’m concerned, this show isn’t the least bit as edgy or gritty as it thinks it is. It’s more like a desperate dad trying to make his baby smile by stretching his face out and go “abloogeewoogeewoo”. And when that’s not working, he tells the kid about all the fucked-up things he saw in the world like a twelve-year old who doesn’t know any better. Who’s the baby at that point, huh old man?<br />
<br />
There’s this stupid conversation between the male students and their principal in which he’ll allow them to stay a little longer if they can tell him whether or not boobs or asses are better and why that is. The punchline is supposed to be that being perverted gets you rewarded, which I think has only been used in at least ten different gross-out comedies, as well as every Kevin Smith film ever. Most of all, I don’t even care about the semantics regarding which is better. It’s a dumb conversation to have in real life and it’s dumb in fiction.<br />
<br />
Another memorable attempt at the show’s desperation was when the closest thing to a male lead tried to sneak out of the school in order to show up for a date. Let’s be generous for now and say we give two shits for if he actually shows up or not, but the attempts at hiding his break-out are just pathetic because it’s very obvious he won’t get caught until the episode ends at the very least, and the punchline is always that he avoids getting caught due to last-minute circumstance that’s too weird to be funny. I’ll admit to smiling a bit at the defecation radio because that actually seemed possible in reality, but that’s it.<br />
<br />
But I think the biggest thing that got to me was the finale. First off, it was incredibly obvious who was going to win in the end and the plan to achieve said end was pretty damn simplistic in of itself with virtually no twists to the formula or any attempt to make the characters less boring resulting from it. And yet the show drags the plan out for three episodes just so it can cram in a hundred more overlong “oh shit, I saw a woman’s privates” joke whenever it spots an opportunity to do so whilst tying up loose ends that quite frankly missed the mark for payoff ages ago. Yeah, South Park itself has a tendency to overreach, but not to this extent.<br />
<br />
Second, I won’t spoil the final result, but I felt nothing for anybody after everything was wrapped up, and not just because of the rampant yet confusing sexism. Because at the end of the day, nothing’s changed aside from certain circumstances. The characters have achieved nothing, learned nothing, will never be remembered for anything, and have certainly not learned how to be funny to anyone older than twelve. All the suffering they went through? What exactly was the point of it all? Please tell me. I’m dying to know.<br />
<br />
I’ve heard some people who acknowledge this show’s problems by saying it gets by on the tension. As we’ve covered before regarding Detroit Metal City, I find this impossible to feel when the show has an over-the-top style that is ALWAYS on. It NEVER takes a break to have the characters actually act human or feel like they’re in real danger. Imagine if the intrigue in Gurren Lagann was dealt with using the same “who the hell do you think I am/raw raw fight the powah” atmosphere as mostly everything else in that show. We’d think Imaishi wasn’t taking the audience seriously, or that Baz Luhrmann somehow broke into the industry. When they say style can be substance, they don’t mean keep the style on 24/7. Because even the most powerful religious symbolism gets old if you just hammer in the same verse over and over.<br />
<br />
No likable characters, no funny jokes, not a lick of sense regarding anything that happens, and whatever tension that’s supposed to exist throughout the series is undermined by the fact that I’m watching a bunch of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys rejects constantly trying to perform bad stand-up comedy. Final grade? Utterly forgettable.

    Prison School is a good anime, although it sometimes fails to play to its strengths and descends into pointlessness. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t look to anime for sexual gratification; so when I criticize the censorship, I&#039;m not doing it out of blue-balled resentment. (Well, not just that anyway.) It detracts from the quality of the animation, and it&#039;s often just unnaturally forced into the scene, to cover things that don&#039;t really need to be covered. They can indirectly depict urolagnian debauchery but they draw the line at panty-shots? Prison School has nice animation, but it&#039;s difficult to appreciate this when so much of it is censored. <br />
<br />
Honestly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199858">
        I kind of wish there wasn&#039;t quite so much sex-appeal. I want to be able to just watch and laugh without having to make the sign of the cross every three seconds. A lot of it was just for the purpose of humor, but when we got into territory that was more clearly aimed at arousal, it got a bit more uncomfortable. The series could have been better if it stopped trying to tickle my boner and started focusing solely on tickling my funny bone. (I can tickle my own boner, thank you very much.)<br />
<br />
Speaking of how Prison School could have been better, the characters were something of a minefield placed over a gold mine. Characters like Hana, Vice President, the Principal guy, Kiyoshi, Joe, and Gakuto were great. But then there&#039;s characters like that one guy who had no personality, but got kind of pissy sometimes and that&#039;s all we really know about him so how can I really be expected to know his name, and Mari, who I find to be rather flat compared to characters like the Vice President. (Haha. Flat.) And then there&#039;s Andre. He is filth. He is the most disgusting character, the most repulsive thing, that I have ever seen in any anime. No, in anything. Every time he was on the screen, I felt tears welling in my eyes and beginning to drip down onto my cheeks as my body shook with dry heave after dry heave after vomiting fit. The creator of this character should be shot. Or just killed. I suppose it doesn&#039;t matter how. But he must be brutally murdered (or just murdered, I&#039;m not picky) before he releases another Andre into the world. <br />
<br />
But it&#039;s a testament to the strength of the best characters that the presence of Andre does not result in an automatic 1. Instead, the good, borderline non-existent, and terrible characters balance each other out. I just wish we saw some characters more often. (Like Hana. I want more.) <br />
<br />
The plot is absurd; it barely exists, and what is there is ridiculous, but it still maintains somewhat of a sense of internal consistency, and it works. The premise is bizarre, and a lot of the plot developments just make it weirder, but it has a beautiful sense of logic to it that would make Hegel turn green with envy as he realized the insignificance of his boring collections of meaningless compound words. <br />
<br />
But whatever. You should probably forget everything I&#039;ve said up until now. And I mean everything. Forget everything I&#039;ve ever said in my life. The most important thing is that Prison School is very funny. It could have been better in a lot of aspects, but it succeeds in entertaining its audience. It&#039;s unique and hilarious. You won&#039;t find anything else like it, and it&#039;s not easy to find anything funnier. If you watch it, you will laugh, unless you suck. It&#039;s a comedy; it&#039;s comedic. There you go. It&#039;s a success.<br />
<br />
That said, the gags can get very repetitive, (Despite the changing of details and introduction of some new sexual situation, it&#039;s still the same damn joke. And somebody needs to tell the mangaka that a running gag isn&#039;t just a copy-and-paste thing; you actually have to be creative to keep it funny.) but they don&#039;t quite over-stay their welcome. A lot of the time, when Prison School seemed to get stale, it changed just enough to keep you going for another episode. But, towards the end it really isn&#039;t that funny anymore. Not laugh-out-loud funny anyway. Ramping up the vulgarity does not equate to increasing the funniness, and it&#039;s sort of a cheap tactic.<br />
<br />
Instead of watching this anime, you should probably just read the manga. Think about it. It covers a lot more of the story, it has minimal censorship, and the panel format sometimes lends itself to better comedic timing. (Mostly just the first two.) And what did it really gain in the adaptation? The boring OP and ED? I am unimpressed. But if you absolutely refuse to read manga, then that&#039;s fine too. I would still recommend the anime, provided that you know what you&#039;re getting into. <br />
<br />
A 7 seems about right for Prison School. It is very flawed, but the entertaining parts are entertaining enough for me to call it &#039;good.&#039; It&#039;s certainly better than a lot of other anime out there.

    Ecchi has garnered somewhat of a bad reputation over the years. For those unaware, the term ‘ecchi’ is used among anime fans as a way to describe shows with sexual overtones. Unlike hentai, which is explicit pornographic material, ecchi is meant to be simply erotic and is part of why the anime community views such in a negative light. Because of the nature of the anime industry, erotic content and sexual themes are more likely to be prioritized in production over the possible literary merits of a show. This line of thinking permeates across other genres, leading to an abundance of fanservice – usually unnecessary

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318317">
        sexual content with the purpose of pleasing the audience – being inserted and used for enticing viewers to watch further. This has led many to criticize the concepts of ecchi and fanservice in general, believing its presence indicates a lack of maturity for the anime using them, as well as their intended audiences. But in response to these kinds of claims I would like to pose a question for everyone reading this:<br />
<br />
Is ecchi/fanservice inherently bad?<br />
<br />
Making cynical comments about a lewd act in a series may not be unfounded, but are they fair critiques on the show in question? For example, if a series implements sexuality of some sort as one of its core themes, is it then a flaw for the show to sexualise in any way? Can it even be called fanservice if it is, in fact, a necessary part of the story? If fanservice is merely a way of “giving fans what they want to see”, can it include content that isn’t erotic? To answer the original question, one would also have to account for the multiple queries I’ve brought up and more. Personally speaking, while deliberate audience arousal can easily be abused by a creative staff, if ecchi and fanservice in this context just means having characters exploited for their sex appeal, then my answer is no. Ecchi is not simply bad and to call every ecchi anime bad inherently is to dismiss specific plots and themes from the chance of ever being recognized as great pieces of art. Execution and intention are what separates pandering works from the more purposeful ecchi anime, and when it comes to purpose in ecchi, there might be none bolder than the anime known as Prison School.<br />
<br />
Based on the popular manga written and illustrated by Akira Hiramoto, the premise follows five young boys who are the only men enrolled at Hachimitsu Academy, one of the strictest all-girls schools in Tokyo. With over 1,000 female students to only five males, the academy looks to be a paradise harem for the group. But those unhappy with the admission of boys to their prestigious school quickly make their intentions clear as the five are sentenced to a prison on the campus grounds when caught peeking in the girl’s baths. If the plot sounded preposterous just then, the magic of Prison School is already in effect. <br />
<br />
Much of the acclaim for the manga of Prison School lied in its ability to tell an extremely entertaining story over a long period of time. As a raunchy slapstick-comedy series with enough ecchi to make one’s dick explode, the manga delivered on an enjoyable comic coupled with erotic content and comedy to match. As a manga adaptation, the anime nails on this appeal while also making excellent use of the different medium; trimming whatever fat that could be found in the source material and, as a result, leaving the show with incredibly fast pacing that manages to build on the humour throughout. It rarely lingers on any one specific joke, instead offering various quips and gags in an almost rapid-fire form, building on each scene and making the situations that much more hilarious. In doing so, the comedy hardly gets exhausting as it continuously morphs into something bigger, better, and often with a purpose that directly relates back to the plot.<br />
<br />
Typically when referring to ecchi anime, the plot is frowned upon as in a genre laden with tropes designed to put fanservice at the forefront, storylines are more likely to be used as mere backdrops for the “real plot” to take place. This in turn can lead to all kinds of issues: stilted dialogue, contrived comedy, characters lacking verisimilitude, etc. The way Prison School avoids this is masterful – for a show with sleazy shots at every corner, it never falls victim to the numerous problems that plague other ecchi anime. The entire concept of ecchi is clearly absurd and the narrative is very aware of that fact. Rather than lazily pointing out the absurdities on screen like some of its contemporaries have, Prison School opts to revel in it, crafting an outlandish setting and hysterical characters that effectively sweeps viewers into that wacky world; where what would be mundane events are blown out of proportion to make for some genuinely intriguing and laugh-out-loud moments. The humour works because of how it merges the bizarre, visceral and unexpected nature of these situations to a degree that people can’t help but burst out laughing. There can be a sense of repetition felt in these instances, as every joke involves some element of sex humour. The series makes no apologies for its several close-up crotch shots and overall crudeness. However, the ecchi scenes never simply pander to the viewers. Instead they are worked into the series with attention to detail and constantly progress the story, with subsequent character actions and motives driving the narrative to its conclusion. <br />
<br />
The cast of Prison School are surprisingly strong given the genres the anime belongs to. Even though the series does have a lead protagonist in the form of Kiyoshi, the show gives adequate focus on all five of the male students as they all share a similar level of importance to the plot. They all have their role to play in the grand scheme of things and overtime build distinct personalities from one another. Because the anime centres around five characters instead of one, all ecchi scenes are divided amongst them, helping to ensure none of the main characters are left out across the duration of the anime. Their female prison captors are also fleshed out as more than their exploitative camera angles and fetishized characteristics would ever imply and do receive noteworthy development, providing a separate dynamic to the five male prisoners and their numerous attempts to escape. Every character is highly exaggerated in their behaviour, yet they all ironically fit with the internal consistency and overall atmosphere of the show. It also demonstrates a unique and amusing way of pitting the men and women against one another that remains one of the most memorable instances of such happening in an anime.<br />
<br />
While the series is primarily an ecchi comedy, underlying the veneer of crass humour and lewd anime scenes is an almost inspiring story of friendship and male bonding. As Prison School progresses, we find all five boys subjected to mental and physical abuse on multiple occasions, all in the hopes that they would break and get themselves expelled. This fear of expulsion constantly looms over the main characters, so much so that these moments genuinely carry a sense of tension to them. The way these scenes are approached gives way to just how big are the sacrifices these characters are making. Despite being titillating on the surface, Prison School quickly becomes a battle of wits between inmates and captives within the prison-break subgenre. It’s high-stakes and high-intensity. Thrilling as it is funny, possessing all the standard conventions of a prison tale whilst keeping unpredictable for the majority of its 12 episodes. By embracing the madness of a story where people deliberately shit their pants and have sticks shoved up asses, the anime manages to captivate and draw viewers in with their ridiculous premise and very real stakes. But most importantly, it makes for the audience to rally behind these main characters through all their struggles: their mistreatment, their treachery, the trickery, the forgiveness and eventually, them emerging victorious. <br />
<br />
As a manga notorious for Hiramoto’s hyper-stylized designs and artwork, the anime captures the charm in those images without ever getting lost in motion. J.C Staff was the studio in charge of adapting the source material and they largely succeed in moving the manga’s material to the world of animation. Granted, the animation used is never the highlight of the series, only maintaining a sense of fluidity with little compromise to the general attention of detail on the visuals. But visually speaking the anime is impressive, with expressions, backgrounds and colour palette that are distinct from any other series the studio has worked on. There’s also a surprisingly good amount of cinematography and directing present that deserves recognition. The way Tsutomu Mizushima is able to ramp up the tension and hilarity with simple cuts and blocks may not be subtle but is wholly effective in making the experience that much more enjoyable. However, there is a considerably poor use of lens flare hilariously coined by fans as the “blinding white light of censorship” that covers nearly half the screen whenever a heavy dose of ecchi appears. Thankfully there is an uncensored version available for those unfazed by the show’s sexual scenes.<br />
<br />
Not only does the art direction do the manga justice, the sound direction and voice acting truly brings the manga’s story to life. The sound effects act as a core component for most of the comedy and are utilized extremely well consistently throughout the show. They can get repetitive as they are essentially a part of every joke and jest in the anime, but if anything, they are more likely to elevate the humour as a whole. The voice acting however, I would argue never grows old as for the 12-episode series, viewers are left craving for more of these characters and their performances. All the voice acting here was tremendous and on-point, with the actors for Kiyoshi, Gakuto and Hana being the standouts. They clearly made the most of their roles and manage to fit each crazy persona like a glove. The soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa, who has also been responsible for the music behind Planetes and Code Geass. Although the tunes here are nowhere near as memorable as the latter anime, they do capitalize on the sheer intensity of scenes whenever played. For a comedy series like this one, that is crucial in making the show such a fun time.<br />
<br />
Rarely do we come across a show like Prison School that blends the likes of comedy and ecchi together so seamlessly. Ecchi comedy have been prevalent in anime for a long time and that is not likely to change anytime soon, but hardly any of them feel worth the time investment. More often than not, an ecchi will feature a bland, unrelatable protagonist who is either indifferent or completely avoids the harem created for him, alongside ecchi scenes that tend to come off shallow, adding nothing to the quality of the series. But Prison School is different. In a world when boys actions are often driven by sex, all five of the main characters are more than their one-dimensional counterparts and hold legitimate reason behind their actions: they have penises. Prison School is truly a man’s show, as where it succeeds outweighs all of its flaws, making for one of the best ecchi and comedy anime in recent memory. It’s hilarious, it’s absurd, and it’s brilliant.<br />

    You’re probably thinking what does “prison”and “school” have to do with each other? Isn’t prison where criminals go to and school is where people get an education? Prison School sort of works differently. When the ratio of girls to guys is around 20:1, then you know your school has something that’s worth more than just education. Of course, I’m referring to the elite boarding school known as Hachimitsu Academy.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga of the same name, the series was long sought to get an anime adaptation at some point. And when it did, there were concerns about how it should be adapted. The concerns includes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199587">
        the amount of censorship or material omitted as a show like this may not be suitable to air on TV. And that’s pretty obvious to tell as well. Prison School is literally like a fan service extravaganza. No less than 30 seconds into the first episode and you’ll realize it why. However, I would also describe Prison School more as a comedy thriller, a show that satirizes fan service itself. Sounds a bit odd right? If you’re interested, keep reading on.<br />
<br />
The story involves 5 boys. They are Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Shingo, and Andre. Kiyoshi is sort of the primary protagonist among them although all of them get spotlight in the story some way or another. Regardless, the school they are attending has over 1000 girls and they are some of the few guys. While this seems like some sort of heavenly dream coming true, it isn’t as easy as it sounds. It turns out, there’s a strong female dominance and authority at the school. This mainly composes of the Underground Student Council made of an elite group of female characters such as Mari, Hana, and Meiko. Their main intention is to get the boys expelled and throughout the show, we see how far they go. To say the least, the Underground Student Council is ridiculously powerful. They seem to have absolute rule over the school and anyone who fails to abide by their authority will pay the consequence. This is where the prison part comes in as people get locked up. For its purpose, the show often portrays the women abusing the boys while the main characters tries to make the most of their time there. Remember what I said about fan service earlier? That part easily comes to play when most of the female characters are sexualized throughout the story. Take Meiko for example. She is one of the Student Council members and often punishes the boys through extreme form of sadism such as whipping, brutalizing, and beating up the boys to get satisfaction. Andre is mostly the victim of her assaults although there’s implications that he secretly enjoys it. While all this seems a bit over-the-top notch, I dare say that its performance is more like a thriller. The comedy is the fan service while the thriller is how much the boys can take the mental and physical abuse. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, most if not all the boys are perverts. Kiyoshi is probably the tamest of them and probably also the most normal character in the show. His crush on Hana, a secretary of the Student Council, often lands him into controversial positions. Despite this, Kiyoshi is an honest guy and stands firm as a character that most others contrast in this series. The other boys also show some delicacy when it comes to their own personalities but none of them come close to him. A good amount of emphasis is also placed on some of their interactions with female characters. While most of them are victims of the characters, there are some that achieve a bit of closure. For instance, we have Shingo’s relationship with Anzu that seems to develop into some genuine love. Kiyoshi’s relationship with Hana also has some bits of innocence although given the nature of the show, it’s mostly satirized by fan service. <br />
<br />
As fan service dedicates the style of Prison School, the plot has less of a focus. The story is actually pretty simple and prison breaking is part of its plot element. It’s exactly as the premise implies and follows it pretty accurately. When it comes to adaptation faithfulness, there’s some obvious content that is omitted while the story itself is rushed. On the other hand, the adaptation does an explicit job with its comedy. I can’t remember how many times I laughed when watching this show. This is set by Prison School’s high standards of crafting ridiculousness. It’s as if the fan service is alive and self-aware. Cameras are deliberately focused to highlight moments when boobs are bounced or when crotch shots are shown in close view. There’s also some comedic symbolism such as with the mushroom or Medusa that really create a sensational satire. So in essence, Prison School knows its intentions and isn’t shy at all from hiding it. If you want to be serviced, this is where it’s at. <br />
<br />
By adaptation standards, the artwork is crude but in a good way. For some reason, Madhouse decided to toughen it up a notch and make the boys look more ripped than their manga counterparts. Similarly, the female characters show all sort of juicy body parts. As the show is saturated by fan service, there’s almost endless amount of it. There’s also both a censored and uncensored version so watch at your own discretion. In the meantime, the series’ school looks normal except with the establishment of the prisons. <br />
<br />
When it comes to soundtrack, Prison School’s success comes from the characters. It takes a strong cast to convince the audience of realism of the setting. Thankfully, the cast pulls it off. Character reactions matches in par with the voice in particular during torture scenes. Yes, torture scenes. This is when the boys get their mental and physical abuse from the Underground Student Council. The voices screams both pain and pleasure as it convinces the audience of their complication. On a lesser scale, the OST and theme songs are much more standard although I will say that some of the symbolism portrayed in the OP theme song is cleverly done. The OST also gets some thrilling moments in particularly some of the later episodes as the boys gets more desperate to fight back.<br />
<br />
What is the endgame for a show like this? My advice is to give the first 5 minutes a try. If you can last that long, then you’ll have an easy time watching the series. Be aware that fan service is endless and you may forget at times what the story is actually about. Regardless if you’re an anime-only or manga veteran, Prison School accurately adapts its comedy with the character reactions. Unfortunately, the show is only a 1-cour so do expect content to be omitted. (there’s a “teaser” for a potential second season though) Whether these may be something appealing or a personal favorite will be left in the dust. Despite that, Prison School in the end is a fun show. It’s fun enough to not only portray fan service in an overwhelming way but one that makes you come back for more.<br />

    Prison school is in fact a great example of bad show with great elements. Prison School successfully takes suspense, drama, action, and ecchi, turns them into one perfect mess. Prison School is also a great example of a &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; anime show. Meaning you either like it or don&#039;t like it depending or your personal tastes in anime and experience.  The story is sort of plain however the elements they add like violence, sexy scenes, drama, suspense etc literally makes the a bit non existent. There are many things I like about story though, but for now the thing that stood out the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203781">
        most was the fact that (and stated before) the show overall was so bad it&#039;s good. The soundtrack is awesome lots of rock and metal added to make action scenes and &quot;Uh oh i&#039;m in trouble&quot; scenes more suspense. The characters, will never, ever be forgettable. Prison school has one of the best cast of unforgettable characters I have seen in a while. Hana (she&#039;s first because she was my favourite) Kiyoshi, the vice president, the Chairman of the school, just about everyone is unforgettable. You, the viewer, if Prison school is up you alley and you enjoy bizarre shows this show is indeed for you. Overall I think the show was Really, really good given the elements and story the creator and directors were working with. 8/10

    This is the first anime review I&#039;ve ever written, so hopefully everything will turn out ok. Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive :D<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Prison School is all about 5 guys in a school for girls that are caught peeping in the girl&#039;s bathroom, and are sent to a prison in the middle of the school. Pretty normal, huh? You&#039;ve seen nothing yet lmao. I gave the story &quot;just&quot; an 8 because  the storyline had some ups and downs, as after episode 7, the whole plot is left a bit unconsistent, but recovering later on.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
What makes Prison School such

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199666">
        a good show is the animation. I was extraordinary suprised by how each character&#039;s face is done to emphasize how they are feeling in each moment, not to mention the smoothness throughout the whole show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Nothing special to say here. Music was pretty sweet, especially the opening.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
Did I say animation was what made the show good? HAH. Characters in the show are just the most hilarious thing EVER. Normally when seeing the show, I would almost laughh just by seeing their weird ass face. But what really stands out for me is the fact that you are always mind fucked by everything they do, combined with a great sense of humor (plus animation). <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
What can I say. I&#039;ve enjoyed every single chapter in the whole show, and not only would I watch the chapter every single week but also be thinking about it for the next days.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.5/10<br />
In conclusion, Prison School can be defined by one word: awesome. i didn&#039;t give it a 10 because of the post-escape storyline, but overall, I would recommend this great anime to almost everyone.

    Prison school is a weird one for me. That&#039;s mostly due to because I absolutely despise ecchi / harem / blah, blah generic titillating content that&#039;s incredibly common in anime. And that might be why I enjoyed the show to a certain extent. It takes the idea of fanservice and stretches to a very specific and fetishized realm that it can end up being hilarious to some people or, at least, intriguing because the absurdity of it.<br />
<br />
That said, besides a couple of moments spread out far and between I wasn&#039;t laughing or let alone chuckling as much as I heard I was going to be.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211584">
        Some jokes are repeated or just go for a bit too long which ends up at times being slightly annoying. The story isn&#039;t much either; Do me a small favor and read the synopsis of this show. Did it? That&#039;s the entire show but stretched to 12 episodes. <br />
<br />
Sure, some things happen here and there, but it follows a very simple formula. People do things, people get punished for doing those things, the end. Which sure, is fine and dandy as long as the characters are interesting, but besides two out of the three crazy dominatrixes, the entire cast is pretty forgettable. <br />
<br />
We have a perverted boy band of main characters; The first being the standard, boring anime dude, second, the nerdy guy, third, the tough guy, fourth, the fat one and last but not least, the wimpy weird one. Like I said, besides two out of the crazy trio the characters are pretty darn boring. <br />
<br />
But I still enjoyed the show, I mean is not great, but is not bad either. Is a good time waster if you have nothing else to do and hey if you want to see an incredibly over-the-top and fetishized version of your standard ecchi wank-off fest, check it out. Worst case scenario is that you wasted your time by reading this review and hated the show thanks to my weird yes and no recommendation for the thing. What do you have to lose!? <br />

    Prison School is just one of those anime that you will get hooked at the first episode. The manga is excellent, but it seemed fast-paced in the anime. Honestly this anime is like the South Park characters all grown up and horny, and what makes it even more funnier is how these guys are such relentless virgins, its hilarious. Even if the show was vile and disturbing, it was entertaining to watch during my free time. <br />
<br />
I thought of the vice president as an overly sexualized character, but thats what makes it even funnier. The sexual scenes make the anime look like a hentai anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200674">
        honestly. Overall, I have nothing to say about this anime other than it was one of the most hilarious anime I&#039;ve ever seen.

    This series is utterly appalling. The mediocre art, accompanied by tasteless, immature humor and the tendency to over-appeal to every fetish out there, make Prison School one of the worst anime I have ever seen. The characters are not even remotely likable, the sound is decent, but the archetypes of plot progression failed to inspire me or any of my friends in any meaningful manner.<br />
<br />
Beside the poor design and application, Prison school attempts to approach a classic anime trope and blows it way out of proportion. The hyperbolic setup for this series destroyed any semblance of hope I had in this anime.<br />
<br />

    DISCLAIMER: This anime is for mature audiences.<br />
<br />
This anime is currently on episode 12/12(Complete) and that deeply saddens me because this anime uses shock humor at its finest. If there is a weakness to this anime it&#039;s the over the top fan service; however, some may find this as a bonus (I don&#039;t).<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10-<br />
The story is very entertaining and has good comedic value. There are many scenes I found enjoyable. Give the anime 4-5 episodes before you might drop it because the nonsense will make sense eventually. As redundant as that sounds trust me on this one. The plot is simple, but executed well. Overall I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200170">
        gave this an 8/10 for it&#039;s entertainment value and comedic expertise. If the plot were more intricate I could have graded the story higher. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art was on par with many current anime&#039;s. It can be a little flashy and sexually explicit (more so sexually explicit) than other current anime. That is perfectly fine because the identity calls for it to a degree. I gave the art a 9/10 for its crisp clear visuals and its well formed variety of character expressions. <br />
<br />
Sounds: 8/10<br />
The sound was competitive with other anime&#039;s, but did not standout. After watching the anime you won&#039;t remember the sound as much as the scene it was the background for. I think the sound suffered from the visuals and story, as they grabbed the viewers attention in a demanding way. For those reasons I gave the sound an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The characters in this anime are very fun, light, and enjoyable (Chiyo Chan is adorable!!!). Their development is done considerably well when you take into account the length and purpose of this anime. I gave this a 8/10 for those reasons above.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
I can&#039;t express how entertaining this anime is. This anime has absurd, but sharp comedic value. (*SPOILER ALERT*) (***DON&#039;T READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU DON&#039;T CARE TO SEE SMALL SPOILER***) You have peeing on others, homosexual innuendos, and just shocking off the wall comedy. Watch with your own discretion.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
Review the above reasons to see specific details on why I believe this anime warrants a 9/10.<br />
<br />
I hope you find this helpful and enjoy the anime!

    Prison School took me by surprise. I have never laughed so hard at something so degenerate, stupid, yet undeniably hilarious since GTO. The humor is so amazingly well executed that the stupidest things will drive the plot, which is surprisingly well done. One of the greatest strengths of Prison School is the voice acting, as all the proper screeches and fluctuations come in fitting times to make the experience worthwhile. There isn&#039;t much significant character development, a deep plot, or any of that, but rather this anime utilizes all the ideas we find ridiculous and mashes it together, backing the viewers out into a corner

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201953">
        where they have no choice but to laugh. The directing is great, as the animation is by the same studio that responsible for &quot;Shokugeki no Souma&quot;. The camera angles are utilized to its fullest to provide the ultimate ecchi-comedic effect. Great anime to watch in groups, if you find a few friends who can see the humor in degeneracy. Very impressive overall, but if you don&#039;t find the first episode amusing, then don&#039;t bother with the rest. If you do, you&#039;re in for a ride, as each episode tops its previous shenanigans.

    AS AN ANIME<br />
<br />
Prison School was without a doubt a surprise for a lot of viewers, even if I&#039;m sure some of you fans of the manga were waiting for it (that was not my case).<br />
<br />
Produced by J.C. Staff,  a studio well-known for adapting mediocre light novels and for their bad deeds against reputed visual novels, their relatively poor artistic sense in comparison with competiting studios, and their more or less tight budget (generally more than less), Prison School&#039;s adaptation was kind of disappointing even before we could watch it. I myself didn&#039;t plan to see more than the first episode, and talking with some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200351">
        blinded fans of the manga beforehand didn&#039;t encourage me to review my position (don&#039;t ask me why, it&#039;s not even anticonformism but more something like disgust regarding their circlejerk for which I was insensible).<br />
<br />
Finally, the first trailer came out and, stunned by the care given to the visuals, I was very decided to watch at least the beginning. Anyway, let&#039;s talk about the anime in itself.<br />
<br />
For those who discovered Prison School for the first time (like me), some might have been a bit perplexed at the beginning, but quickly, without even liking that much this exagerated, distasteful ecchi side, everyone seemed to go along with the entertaining plot. To the point it became hard to wait for next week&#039;s episode, the suspense being definitely present, and sometimes unbearable. If what I&#039;m saying is giving you hope to find again a good thriller series like Death Note, it&#039;s not a coincidence, I guess.<br />
<br />
The manga plays a lot with parody. It parodies ecchi (some think so at least) by using it in a shameless and absolutely commercial manner, until it becomes, like I already said earlier, distasteful and taxing. But the adaptation goes further, until even mimicking the sonorities of Hollywood blockbuster movies&#039; soundtracks, which award it, as an anime, a certain singularity, a really dramatic or even epic side. It also parodies thrillers like Death Note, or maybe even Prison Break (which I didn&#039;t see, so I&#039;m only imagining), and from this absurd blend of absurd, erotism, pinch situations and friendship in a prison-school environment (?!) is born a funny mess in where each situation — and that is less true for their solution which seemed very well-thought and logical — seems to come from another world so much improbable they are.<br />
<br />
What is excellent in the end is definitely how the main characters succeeds to find their way out of the worst dead-ends, in a manner much more composed and believable than all the unbelievable shit that fall upon them. And it is, in a way, exhilarating, like a good Death Note, even if more original.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I couldn&#039;t wait for the end of the broadcasting so I started reading the manga after episode 4. Which made me realize some flaws inherent to the anime, which may not be noticeable or bugging when you only experienced this one. I don&#039;t really consider them like cons, or maybe yes I do, but I think it could have been way more awesome if this part would have had a better treatment.<br />
<br />
AS AN ADAPTATION<br />
<br />
The problem is the pacing. A flaw that I seem to often notice in recent anime adaptations like Parasyte, Seven Deadly Sins, Magi or even Hunter x Hunter 2011, and which seems be something like a new  trend or a commercial approach allowing to adapt more, while keeping a low number of episode which avoid fillers and also permit a constantly good animation quality all the way to the end without costing buckets (and all this by satsifying the general public, traumatized by Naruto fillers and One Piece&#039;s catastrophic recent episodes). I complain so much about those pacing issues these times that I feel obligated to talk about it, for once I make a review. Maybe I&#039;ll convince you, reader, and you&#039;ll finally understand why filler is, in itself, not a bad thing, and can be an intelligent way to give additional value to the adaptation, while saving money and time (for the long-running franchises at least).<br />
<br />
It&#039;s when I read Prison School&#039;s manga that the parodying side of Death Note came to my eyes : the dark tones from some scenes, the camera angles and the internal monologues in pinch situations, the keikakus (it means plan). And it&#039;s very well done in the manga. And Death Note anime is very impressive too, because it adapts perfectly this psychological tension, while being very dynamic (it could have been slower and more boring like Monster — I like Monster), and the pacing doesn&#039;t feel too much rushed, the thought processes are well rendered and believably timed.<br />
<br />
One of the loss which come from the very fast pacing in the anime is unfortunately the intensity of the best psychological scenes (those with Hana, mainly), it goes fast, too fast, I personally found it difficult to feel worried about Kiyoshi&#039;s recurrent incredible and desperate situations. I&#039;m not an expert, nor a scriptwriter, but I think that some added lines of introspective monologue, or silent stills to show the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, even filler,  would have helped to add a bit of hesitating emotions, and even some intensity, to those scenes.<br />
<br />
In fact, to put it simply, the anime&#039;s director gave us an external point of view of the scene, the one of a spectator, when the manga gave me a more &quot;in Kiyoshi&quot; feeling, which felt much more tense and desperate and made me worry about the next actions, &quot;what should he do, he&#039;s risking his social life right now, poor Kiyoshi&quot;.<br />
<br />
The &quot;external viewer&quot; point of view that the director put in place isn&#039;t in my opinion very appropriate because the jokes aren&#039;t so well-thought in themselves (it&#039;s just the level of absurdity that is amazing), so seen  from outside it just looks like some retarded chain of quickly happening dumb actions commited by the characters, when from an internal point of view, more introspective, everything at stake seem much more important and heavy. It&#039;s too bad, in my sense.<br />
<br />
The other flaw in this anime is also, in my opinion, directly due to the fast-pacing. And it&#039;s much more to the core of the anime, so it&#039;s plain wrong. The problem when you go so fast, it&#039;s that the gags don&#039;t have the time to take properly effect. A big part of the comedy in this anime is absurd, but really some &quot;what the fuck did I just watch?!&quot; kind of absurd. The thing is, as a manga, Prison School give the reader one or two gag per chapter, so you can digest them with a laugh before reading the next chapter. But in the anime, and I have to precise beforehand that it adapted more or less 80 chapters in 12 episodes (didn&#039;t count exactly), the events and unbelievably ridiculous actions come one after another in pack of ten, the viewer don&#039;t have any time to integrate the joke, so it could have sink in.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not a secret that for some jokes, the timing is very important. In Prison School, the joke that is supposed to make you laugh after 5 seconds, not because your brain is slow and that one is very subtle, but more because you really need 5 good seconds the realize the immensity of the ridiculousness of what just happened before your eyes, this awesome stupidity is sweeped away by the next one that comes only 3 seconds after and for which you will do your best to understand to follow the story, to finally sacrifice the comic potential of the situation. And I also think that&#039;s too bad.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the anime place itself in the grandstand, rather than wanting to be involved to understand what happens in the field, with the players, it&#039;s a shame but it is nevertheless a very good anime, granted with a good soundtrack and a stunning visual work, there&#039;s a lot of things that happens in the plot that will keep you from getting bored even if some joke, while staying always astounding, are less impacting than they could have been. And maybe you will succeed better than me at involving yourself in the characters through the anime, a thing I couldn&#039;t do with the pacing imposed on me by J.C. Staff.<br />
<br />
And for those who loved the first season, you have to know that it is only the beginning and the sequel will be even better, the psycho-erotic frenzy really takes off at episodes 11-12, and a lot of the following event are equal or worth more than those, some reminding me a lot the deviant but intimate  perversion of manga like Nozoki Ana.

    If, there was an anime genre that I can label as wasted potential is would be ecchi genre. Despite the genre itself having 758 animes including squeals only a handful of them are actually good or at least competent. The reason why I say this is that the majority of ecchi anime tend no purpose other than to meander to the lowest common denominator of anime fans. They love to showcase numerous sexual shots yet the show’s don’t have anything to say.<br />
<br />
Look am not expecting every ecchi series to be Evangelion or other cynical series out there but there should be a fine line between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383458">
        fun and goofy ecchi to the hamfisted ecchi. High School DXD, Testament Of Sister Devil and To Love Ru Darkness are solid examples of how to be fun and goofy ecchi anime<br />
<br />
Granted not all of them were necessarily good but their least hey had character and charm which I cannot say the same thing for shows like Maken Ai, AntiMagic Academy, Hybrid x Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia, Ikkitousen, Dears, Photokano etc where their hamfest fan-service without any effort, commentary, charm or substance.<br />
<br />
Then again there were 2 ecchi series out of the 758 ecchi series that not only embraces and comments on all the cliches and tropes from the genre, but they managed to be very good anime in the progress making them stand out from other ecchi anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are two anime are Prison School and Shimoneta. Prison School and Shimoneta came out the same anime season. I watched these two show’s as they aired in their unfortunate censored form. In the Funimation clearance Christmas sale I brought these two show’s at the same price £4.99 and they arrived at my house at the same time. What I am about to next may be confusing or even strangely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prison School and Shimoneta are oni twins. Sure their approach towards comedy and ecchi are different but the way their constructs its themes are similar to each other. Prison School is the Blue Oni while Shimoneta is the Red Oni and this review will be about Prison School and how it managed to tell a complement grounded tale about sex while being one of the funniest ecchi animes to ever made.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main thing that I appreciated right out of the gate is grounded the main cast are. They may appear to be your typical sexual lowlifes as they just wanted to take a peek on the girl’s underwear but the anime throws that negative out of the window due to the paradise but cruel solutions that they are in.<br />
<br />
They attended a school where almost all the girls hate men which is unlikely for them due to later events where they get physically and mentally abused by the underground student council. The moment when our leads get caught by the underground student council just for honestly peaking at the girls at the shower changing room their lives at the school literally go to hell. The word honestly perfectly describe the main cast. They knew it was wrong to do that just wanted to embrace their sexual fantasies. If, this was another show then the male lead would either be a coward or a dense idiot.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the girls in those shows despite knocking the male lead out will be on the male lead crouch for the sake of fantasy. Prison School avoids this by making most of the girls immune to the boys sexual pleasure. It’s honestly a breath of fresh air if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Over the course of 12 episodes, we follow our honest leads who live their lives at Prison School where do chores as well as getting physically and mentally beaten up by the underground student council for wrong acts. That’s basically the plot of Prison School simplified but there’s much more to it. Despite the story itself being borderline plotless it still managed to be interesting due to the anime exploring a rather dark subject of gender empowerment.<br />
<br />
These guys get humiliated and beaten up daily just for doing something wrong or even breathing by the student council. Prison School showcases the lowest point of the female gender. If this was another situation then the girls would either told smack them or simply tell the teacher not mentally or physically beat them to a where they may receive life-threatening injuries. Sure boys can be creepy but you don’t have necessarily cripple their lives. The subject of gender empowerment comes in full in the final episodes which I won’t talk about due to spoilers but the show delivers two meaningful messages that gender rights should not be broken and there are other ways to deal with sexual harassment problems than mindless violence. I’ve learned something from an ecchi series.<br />
<br />
Outside the show’s intriguing take on the dark subject, the show is fun-packed with mostly rich comedy and humour to back it up. The anime is proud to display its crude humour to the viewer. This is anime where have people sticks up their ass, people crapping themselves in Class to one person commanding someone to pee in front of them. This was made possible due to the author having a clear understanding of comedy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main characters are the stars of Prison School. Despite the show having a primary protagonist being Kiyoshi, the show spends it developing its 5 leads each with importance and personality. They are all distinctive from one another and most if not all the ecchi scenes are divided among them making some truly fascinating character interactions. A similar thing can be said for the Underground Student Council as well as Chiyo and Anzu who each have importance to the plot as well as being entertaining to watch from beginning to end.<br />
<br />
J,C Staff was tasked to bring Akira Hiramoto art style to life and they’re perfectly succeeded. Not only the art style was extremely fateful to the source material but it’s also visually impressive to boot. From the character expressions, background scenery, attention to detail, superb shot composition, to the sharp contrast colour palette the anime managed to be a visual spectacle that’s filled with a lot of effort and passion by the animation staff.<br />
Along with the fantastic production values comes to music and sound effects.<br />
Code Geass/Yu-Gi-Oh Arc V music composer Koutarou Nakagawa delivers an excellent score for Prison School.<br />
<br />
Both the opening and ending themes are memorable and catchy.<br />
<br />
I usually don’t talk about sound effects in my reviews as I usually don’t much attention to it but, Prison School is one of the few expectations as the sound effects they were used are phenomenal. The sound team must have used high-quality equipment for the record the sound because the sounds of whipping, crushing and sweating sound realistic.<br />
<br />
The English Dub controversial aside from the TV broadcast is pretty good. The dub actors did a good voicing their respective characters for the series.<br />
<br />
This is not to say Prison School is a masterpiece.<br />
There’s an obvious lack of character development for certain characters in the series especially from the underground student council and some of the humour eventually got grading overtime but Prison School achieves something that most ecchi anime don’t and that’s honestly and the word honesty is the best word that sums up Prison School.<br />
<br />
A show that’s not scared showcasing its cruel content but, it not only managed to be funny most of the time but managed to have a well-written story, excellent production values, a fun character cast, a good English dub and a nicely composed soundtrack.<br />
<br />
I’m happy a show like this was able to exist.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
So I didn&#039;t expect to like Prison School nearly as much as I did. In fact, this may be one of the best anime series I&#039;ve seen thus far. What I&#039;m seeing from people discussing this show is contempt for the more risque and bold elements it utilizes so often. A dismissive attitude is taken towards just about every facet of the shows storytelling, structure, and characters when you can wave the magic &quot;fanservice&quot; stick and reject the positives that this story brings. <br />
<br />
To describe this further, I want to go to the root of the issue. Fanservice. What does it mean and how does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240963">
        it affect the way someone views something. Especially if that someone regards fanservice as wholly negative. Or, I should say, what fanservice has become. <br />
<br />
Let&#039;s begin. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Fanservice : What It Means and What It Is]<br />
<br />
Fanservice, as a term, began as a description of a series, show or film, that gained a following of fans that imposed their views onto the creative staff. This could be having opposing views to the stories being developed or something as simple as pushing a relationship between two characters that only they see. <br />
<br />
Instead of proceeding with their own vision, the creative teams of these products decided to cater their content towards the fans. Which meant creating plot devices, no matter how contrived, to create these pairs or storylines. At its base, this is exactly what fanservice is. Servicing the fans. Giving them what they want to see. This is a negative term because it often resulted in characters being flanderized. <br />
<br />
Flanderization is a term that strictly exists in the media landscape. The general definition is a character losing their humanity and becoming nothing but a collection of their most popular traits. For example, if there&#039;s a great child character that also happens to be excessively adorable and the fans love the kind of cute shit this character does. If the creative team decides that they want to make this show strictly about fanservice, they&#039;d slowly forget about every other character trait just to force scenes of that character being cute. Therefore flanderizing the character and making them more hollow as a result. <br />
<br />
Fanservice, as a term, grew from there. It evolved to talk about fans of a medium in general. Like anime? Well you have a specific set of things you may like that are generally included in just about every anime there is. For example, this could be the fact that as a whole, a vast majority of hardcore anime fans love seeing cute girls with big tits act clumsy and stupid. So now every show past a certain demographic has a cute, clumsy girl with big sweater puppies. That&#039;s servicing the fans by creating content that the creators think they&#039;ll like without the fanbase for that specific piece of work existing yet. <br />
<br />
This is how a list of certain tropes and archetypes began flooding into anime. Seemingly overnight an influx of certain character types penetrated the industry. These archetypes slowly became tropes which slowly became boring, unoriginal cliches. <br />
<br />
The last evolution of the term laid with online communities. It simply began meaning having tits in your show. Or ass in your show. Or some kind of romanticization of any of that. Sexy characters doing cute or sexy things. This is where I have to disagree. If a show starts with concrete themes and original ideas that happen to involve sexuality or sex in some way, is that servicing fans? Or is that simply creating a story. If it doesn&#039;t impact the overall shows quality, in fact, in many casing, adding to the entire concept, should it be dismissed? <br />
<br />
The answer is no. Throughout my journey through Prison School, there were gross, sleazy shots of these perverse characters. yet none of them felt pandering or exhausting or even sexy. None of it felt like it was there to sell to a lowest common denominator. So either i&#039;m completely missing something, which I find hard to believe since i&#039;m generally incredibly critical of &quot;fanservice&quot;. Or, more logically, the show is simply following a structure. That structure involves batshit insane sexuality, fetishism, and violence. None of it felt pandering. Why? Because it was all played for the theme. More importantly, it was all made to make you laugh. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[The Narrative Jail]<br />
<br />
We follow five characters as they try and survive a prison that is hilariously located within a school environment. Being sentenced to jail for doing what boys do, peeping, they try to balance relationships, labor, and escaping. If it sounds ridiculous then it&#039;s doing the trick. <br />
<br />
This show is solidly insane. The idea is so crazy and hard to believe, it&#039;s almost crazier to think that I found myself fully buying into it by episode two. An idea can only be stupid if it&#039;s execution is stupid. If the idea is far-fetched then the writer needs to work extra hard to sell that idea. Whether it&#039;s through comedy, drama, or flat out surrealism. <br />
<br />
A lot of this shows premise and comedy that gets drawn out of it comes from the way the story is treated. Instead of having characters constantly break the meta by pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation, they instead double-down on the seriousness. That seriousness transforms into believe-ability as you get just as swept away as the characters do. By treating the situation seriously, the narrative not only sets proper stakes, but also creates a great anti-dichotomy. Both drawing comparisons to how school and prison relate and how they differ. <br />
<br />
But the show doesn&#039;t waste time making these kinds of parallels. This is because Prison School doesn&#039;t waste any time. Period. The first four episodes fly by because their pacing is so incredibly fast. If a joke doesn&#039;t land, then the one that comes two seconds after may. Its ability to build on a scene and progressively make the situations more and more ridiculous causes this potentially exhausting scenario all the more hilarious and entertaining. <br />
<br />
What struck me as surprising was the amount of tension this show can build. What was even more surprising was the amount of tension it can build while still being funny as fuck. The pacing services the comedy, the three separate arcs of the show service the tension. When a scene is intense it&#039;s smartly played as fully serious.<br />
<br />
The humor comes from the situation, rather than the characters pointing out how stupid the situation is. Which I was so grateful for, since too many shows rest on pointing at something and laughing, rather than explaining the comedy as the scene unravels. By having the characters deal with these stakes that are built up seriously, this show kicks two crows with one stone by creating genuinely intense scenarios with laugh-out-loud results. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
All my praise goes towards the way the first four episodes were dealt with. They were near-flawless executions of character building, comedic timing, and rising stakes with equally rising absurdity as a result. While the show slows down afterwards, I wouldn&#039;t necessarily say that was a bad thing. It begins telling the story of all the characters, rather than two of them. Giving each one a reason to be there and add to the story being told.<br />
<br />
Prison School smartly drops hints and ideas throughout it&#039;s build-up and has each one of these ideas create an entertaining and thoroughly well-done climax. I&#039;d say that this show is a regular anime mystery and thriller but in an absurdist scenario, but I&#039;d be wrong. This is wholly better than any Anime thriller. In fact, this show does better storytelling regardless of the scenario it&#039;s in. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s both thanks to tight narrative structure as well as the characters. <br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[The Prisoners and Their Masters]<br />
<br />
The characters in this show are great. Each one has a role to play and each one builds enough of a character never be fully likeable or hateable. Even the seemingly one-dimensional captors get enough time to actually become believable characters within this absolutely insane universe. The secondaries being included in this show are more there for their quirks, however, even they gain some hilarious and interesting things to do as the series progresses. The Chairman in particular is both hilarious and outstanding as the looming hand of god that peers over the school. <br />
<br />
All five prisoners have their own interesting traits. Even the more hate-able a character becomes they manage to fight their way back into your heart with the writers ability to create scenarios that are heartfelt but also hilarious at the same time. <br />
<br />
The three captors of these prisoners could have very well served as fetishistic dominatrix porn and nothing else. Yet they are constantly played as both threats, but given enough character to also be interesting in their own scenes as well. Each one, as I&#039;ve said, has a role to play. I never felt as though I should be turned on by anything in this show, which is a huge plus to the creative team. While I may not personally be into the whole cartoon thing, I can easily recognize when an anime is trying to be erotic and sexy, and when an anime is trying to play something for laughs.<br />
<br />
This show is undoubtedly exploitative in the way it portrays its characters. However, the amount of which it exploits is where the humor lies. Specifically in the inconceivably ludicrous Vice-President character who carries around a riding crop wearing a short skirt and tits that seem to have a gravity of their own. She&#039;s subject to probably the most sexuality throughout the series, yet none of if felt lame or pointless. We get these hilarious sleazy shots that are never really questioned in-universe. Her entire character may feel one note, yet they develop that note until it&#039;s playing a tune. <br />
<br />
As the Prison School progresses and it&#039;s journey winds down, so do its characters. Each one feels as though they&#039;ve been pushed to the brink and only one side may win. In this universe, the idea of Men vs. Women could&#039;ve been incredibly annoying to me, as i&#039;m consistently annoyed at anime for making it&#039;s female characters useless, unrealistic, exploitative, doting, etc. Yet it comes as one of the biggest surprises that I had none of these feelings during the show. <br />
<br />
While something like No Game No Life infuriated me with it&#039;s blatant figurine-bait characters with absolutely no depth other than the pockets that the producers were lining... Prison School on the other hand goes the extra mile by creating this competition, Girls vs. Boys, in a way where both sides felt equally capable of defeat. <br />
<br />
For once, I feel, the females in an anime that was, for the most part, meant for men were given an intimidating role that wasn&#039;t ever really stripped from them in favor of self-insert bullshit. These girls were awesome. They were memorable. They were exactly what I wanted from villains and it never felt as though they were there to sell. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
While I wish that towards the ending that every character had a role to play in the finale, it felt as though there was one big story being told that never really involved the lesser developed characters. Unfortunately, this caused a feeling of shoehorning certain characters to wrap up a story, rather than actually creating something that can be seen as a &quot;perfect&quot; wrap-up. <br />
<br />
The ending leaves a lot of room for the future of the show, however, it still provides a decent closer in terms of character development and status. <br />
<br />

[Art of a Cell Block]<br />
<br />
The art is mostly great. J.C Staff really put a lot of effort in translating the visuals from the Manga to the series. In fact, i&#039;m thoroughly impressed with the fact that so many of these characters were drawn with so much detail and effort. The shows style overall suited this oddly gritty environment and it helped sell the entire concept better.<br />
<br />
The character design in this show is pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. It keeps a mostly realistic style. However, some of the characters are also hilarious unrealistic in terms of design. Both Andre, a fat tiny-faced student, and Meiko, the student council vice-president are incredibly unrealistic in terms of design. They do mesh well with the other characters too, especially since they are the two most fetishistic and fetishized characters. <br />
<br />
Since a lot of the humor did come from the situation, more specifically, character dealing with a certain situation, J.C staff being able to perfectly translate the hilarious and over-the-top expressions and emotions every character was going through was just brilliant. <br />
<br />
It felt like what KonoSuba could&#039;ve been when it comes to creating punchlines through reactions, rather than a flat-out joke being told.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Music]<br />
<br />
The OP was pretty awful. The ED was pretty bad. That being said, the actual music within the show was flat-out great! A lot of it was thematic, intense, and memorable. I really enjoyed the use of dramatic sound effects to either sell a joke, or a sell a scene as a whole. <br />
<br />
On occasion some of the sounds did become a little repetitive, however, it didn&#039;t get to the point where it detracted from the scene as a whole. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
[Directing]<br />
<br />
I really didn&#039;t expect to be talking about direction with this show. Directing in comedy anime has often been fairly weak in terms of creativity. They set up a scene, they deliver it, and the reaction-based comedy does all the work. Two shows stand out from that crowd. Nichijou, and now Prison School. Very different shows, yet equally bursting with creative direction. <br />
<br />
Tsutomu Mizushima does an outstanding job. I never knew you could be so creative with simple blocking shot utilizing some thicc-as-fuck thighs. There are some genuinely fun PoV shots and some really smart editing. I got some really impressive Edgar Wright vibes from the way some of the scenes were put together. <br />
<br />
Specifically, certain match-cuts elevated scenes from simply funny to flat-out hilarious. I can&#039;t emphasize how much editing and directing in general plays a role in how many jokes in a series land. I can&#039;t think of a single time when a joke in this show fell flat due to an issue in editing or directing, which is some major praise. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Where the Enjoyment Is Derived]<br />
<br />
This show was outstandingly enjoyable. Although peppered with certain flaws it was, as a whole, a very fun experience. One I&#039;d recommend experiencing with like-minded friends rather than alone. The ability to hear the tension build as you journey with these characters is amplified by hearing your friends experience the same thing. <br />
<br />
Prison School isn&#039;t there to be sold as a marketing tool. In fact, i&#039;d say a lot of it is crazy and off-the-wall enough to straight up turn off viewers. However, that&#039;s all the more appealing to me. I love the &quot;no-fucks given&quot; attitude that this show takes. The creative freedom the mangaka had when creating this is so well expressed by the animation studio.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying, but this show is infinitely better being viewed as it was meant to be viewed. Uncensored. I can&#039;t imagine how awful some of the punchlines and extended scenes of gratuitous violence or fetishism may have been if half the shot was black. <br />
<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
[Conclusion]<br />
<br />
Prison School is something to be cherished. I feel like I could&#039;ve easily dismissed it as a fetishistic potential-harem. One-dimensional characters with a limp story that was there only to provide eye-candy. Since I&#039;m not one to really enjoy something meant to just serve the fans, I was incredibly hesitant with watching this series.<br />
<br />
However, its ability to convey genuine tension with more genuine laughter hooked me immediately. It wears its motivations on its sleeve, but these motivations aren&#039;t nearly as sleazy as this shows  scenarios. The motivation is to make you laugh your ass off. I&#039;d be hard pressed to say that this show didn&#039;t do that perfectly. <br />
<br />
The director worked wonders with what he was given and created funny situations significantly more funny with incredibly clever editing and great shot composition throughout. It makes me furious that so many series out there lack this kind of understanding of comedic timing and editing. However, it makes me even more grateful that I was able to watch something that honestly impressed me from a creative directorial standpoint as well as a comedic and storytelling one. <br />
<br />
While it&#039;s not lacking flaws, as our protagonists love interests aren&#039;t nearly as engaging as any other character and the finale could&#039;ve involved more of the shows characters. The solid audio, standout art, surprisingly deft storytelling, and endlessly memorable and bad-ass characters deserve all the praise I can give this show. <br />
<br />
Prison School is infinitely enjoyable if you are a fan of over-the-top scenarios and equally over-the-top characters in a hilariously inappropriate world. Don&#039;t simply dismiss this show as fanservice. Don&#039;t simply expect something lame and tedious. Take the extra step and look into that peephole and maybe you can see what this show is truly keeping locked up.

    What a goddamn stupid-ass, asinine show.<br />
<br />
It almost feels like one of those series that I&#039;d be ashamed to have admitted enjoying, but there&#039;s something that  turns it into an ecchi comedy romp of a very impressive caliber. <br />
What elevates it above the others in its class (and the term &quot;class&quot; here is used very, very loosely) is its utter sincerity in its absurdity. It takes itself as seriously as possible with its pace and its *god-tier* sound and art direction which brings about an incredible sense of urgency for what is an incredibly dumb story premise. By taking itself seriously and going so far

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200812">
        in it comes out the other side, it invites us to laugh at it and telegraphs to us that it knows how stupid it is. Bold, striking art and a hilariously complex orchestral score underline some of the best story moments and dramatic tension, using them as a vehicle for comedy simply by manipulating the tone of the scene.<br />
<br />
This sort of expert manipulation applies *most* of the time. Meiko&#039;s scenes are shamelessly exploitative and her design is absurd, and I&#039;m not a huge fan of her character, especially given how down-to-earth almost every other character&#039;s design is (although she shines as a caricature whenever she&#039;s partnered with Andre for a comedic scene). <br />
Her use in the plot is mostly justified and it&#039;s great for a laugh when her sex appeal is actually used to drive the plot somehow, but her scenes are the closest to that feeling of actual sincerity to its fanservice and I honestly don&#039;t care for that a whole lot. Characters like her and several others pale in comparison to seeing characters like Hana, ones with developing internal conflicts and real struggles (albeit hilarious ones).<br />
As &quot;real&quot; as they can get within the boundaries of the high school comedy genre, anyway.<br />
<br />
In any case, this is a lot more words than is really deserved for a show this stupid. But it is unflinching in its stupidity and dares to go beyond. It&#039;s something to be both respected and laughed at.

    I came across Prison School after checking the top seasonal anime. At first glance I believed it to be nothing of interest, as I am not a fan of ecchi anime. However, after watching the first few episodes I came to understand why it was among the higher ranks of its season.<br />
Story: 7<br />
If I had one word to describe the story of Prison School, I would call it absurd. The simple story that boys can get locked into a school prison is completely nonsensical. However, upon closer evaluation, where does something like this even show up? It is so ridiculous that it can be described

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200850">
        as uncommon. Therefore, it avoids the the usual tag that people like to throw onto shows. Generic. If the story is not good, it will at least be interesting.<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is a eight. I usually don&#039;t bicker too much about art as long as the animation does its job. However the one downside about the graphics of the show is the abundance of censorship. While I do believe that it is probably needed, it can get a little awkward at times and for some, it is even annoying to an extent.<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The music for the anime is a eight. I usually have the same rule for sound as I do art. However, in this case, the sound not only functions within the anime, but it adds a little. <br />
Characters: 10<br />
This is where the anime shines the most. The five boys that enter the prison are already very interesting characters. However, the one thing that makes characters good is change. In prison school change becomes something very apparent. As the five boys continually face challenges, they change a lot throughout the series. <br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Are you serious? This is most definitely a ten. The anime shines the most with its sense of humor. The absurdity of the anime, the strange characters, even the music and art contribute to the overall humor of the anime. If anything, this aspect of the show will always make you want to watch the next episode!<br />
Overall: B<br />
Well the mean of my evaluations round up to 8.6. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons that I feel that the show is a B and not higher. This has a lot to do with the discrepancy of character development. While three of the five boys were given a deep character, two of them didn&#039;t really get highlighted. Also the fact that the censorship was everywhere did make the show a little bit worse in presentation.

    Yours truly is here to write a review about one of your truly&#039;s favorite anime this season.<br />
When I first looked at the tags for this anime, I though it looked fairly promising, &quot;Comedy, Ecchi, Romance, School, Seinen.&quot; Definitely a stereotypical romantic comedy, right?<br />
Oh boy was I wrong. This was nothing like the stereotypical anime that I was expecting, but I guess I&#039;ll just get into the parts of the anime right away.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story was good in comparison to any average anime, and very good in comparison to other romantic comedies, that are almost 100% slice of life and gag comedy. The premise is interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199709">
        in that instead of one main guy and his one dimensional buddy, we have 5 pretty unique guys. First episode features these 5 socially awkward guys in a formerly all-girls&#039; school. Weird stuff happen and they get locked up in a prison that is on school grounds. Umm.... yeah.... Like I said the premise is pretty weird, but very unique. I haven&#039;t read the manga that the anime is based off of, but in that respect, I think the anime did a good job in adapting and definitely in making the viewers enjoy (I&#039;ll get more into this later).<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Let me be clear. If you came here looking for ecchi, you came to the right place. The art could use some getting used to. I personally didn&#039;t hate it, but didn&#039;t like it too much either. It doesn&#039;t have the stereotypical anime girl art to say the least. The backgrounds are very nicely drawn and the character faces are just so side-splittingly hilarious, sometimes I found myself pausing the show just to laugh my head off. Sometimes, I even rewatched certain parts to get more laughs off. I personally didn&#039;t like the immense amount of ecchi, especially with certain parts blurred out and whatnot, but it was definitely bearable.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Oh boy, the sounds were amazing, from the voice actors to the background noises. Especially anything involving the vice president, I pretty much always got some giggles out of that. I thoroughly enjoyed the detail in which the background noises, like how clothes sound like when you move in them, or clothes ripping, or a certain someone pooping their pants... Yeah. I said it.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
Like I said before, there are 5 main guys all with unique personalities. Some of them are pretty nasty, I&#039;ll have to admit, but all are hilarious in their own aspect. My two favorite main guys were Kiyoshi and Gakuto just because they reached such a great dynamic with each other that whenever they came on screen together, I had to prepare myself. However, despite me singing praises, the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. Sure they do have their moments of brilliance, but overall, you can sorta predict what&#039;s going to happen, heck, even the prison guys could predict the actions of the USC members.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
As you could probably guess from my praises on praises above, I really like the show. It truly was a fresh air to the stereotypical romantic comedies out there and ecchis out there. Everything from the art to the sound came in sync with each other to make a super fun, super funny, amazing anime. I haven&#039;t watched too many anime from this season, but I think Prison School really stands out in the ecchi and comedy departments.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review. I can&#039;t really tell how long it&#039;s going to be because I&#039;m typing in a super small box, but if it&#039;s really long sorry teehee:P.<br />
<br />
p.s. If you plan to start watching, look forward to episode 11. It&#039;s crazy funny.

    Prison School was one of the best anime of the season, or at least the most memorable of them.That said this anime is not for everyone.It has a special kind of humor that some people may find offending or just plain vulgar.<br />
<br />
Anyways I found the anime hilarious in a perverted/twisted kind of way and I can easily say I haven&#039;t laughed so much with an anime since a very very long time.<br />
<br />
SO here it is:<br />
<br />
Story~7<br />
<br />
The setting is ideal for the development of an ecchi anime/situation.Pretty straightforward and the anime actually delivers what it promises from the very start.What is interesting is that it actually delivers

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201625">
        something more that is not at all expected.This anime with an unoriginal and very simple and shallow story actually manages to hold a grip on you and make you excited waiting for the next episode.They manage to hype you so much for it and create such intensity that it&#039;s amazing how they did it with such a stupid plot....It&#039;s so stupid it&#039;s amazing....So while the story is plain and unoriginal it flows smoothly and you don&#039;t get tired at all watching the anime(with some repetitive gags here and there).So a 7.<br />
<br />
Character~7<br />
<br />
I can say that all the characters were likeable.But,most of them were shallow and only there to add to the comedy.The show though was focused on comedy so you can&#039;t expect depth of character,so the shallowness is justified.<br />
<br />
What the show manages to do splendidly though,is making you sympathize with the boys which are portrayed at first as perverted and disgusting.It can also remind us of some phases and thoughts that we had as teenagers(at least for the boys).<br />
<br />
Sound~7<br />
<br />
The sound was not something memorable or special.But it managed to highlight and enhance the intensity of the scenes when it was needed so i guess it was pretty okay.(I loved Gakuto&#039;s voice acting though and ofc Kiyoshi&#039;s which was done by a well known voice actor)<br />
<br />
Art~9<br />
<br />
The art is where this anime shined at least for me.The character design was a bit generic and the enviroments and backgrounds plain and mostly gray or black.<br />
<br />
BUT I gave art a 9 because all the special effects,the facial expressions the BLOOD...they were all used perfectly to complement the anime and the comedy.The facial expressions particularly were absolutely hilarious.I haven&#039;t seen something like that anywhere else.It really justifies the 9.<br />
<br />
Also a reminder.The anime has a LOT of ecchi.Huge breasts naked butts....In most anime I find the overuse of ecchi very annoying.But in this case it was used well to add to the comedy,although it can feel a bit much at times.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment~9<br />
<br />
The anime may have flaws and be unoriginal and simple or too vulgar at times.But I really haven&#039;t laughed so much since a long time.I consider it one of the best comedy animes ever made.Althouhg most credit should be given to the amazing manga from which this adaptation came.But the adaptation was actually very well made.So props to the anime as well.<br />
<br />
It should be Noted though (again) that this anime is not for everyone.I know many people wouldn&#039;t even consider this as proper comedy.That said,I found it intelligent(in a twisted and perverted kind of way) so if you are into this style of humour then it should be really enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall~8 <br />
<br />
This was a very good and enjoyable anime.But because it can be over the top and somewhat vulgar I really recommend watching the first episode.You will know by then if this anime is for you or not.<br />
<br />
