    Ichigo Mashmiaro is another slice of life anime set around the life of four Elementary School friends and a sister.  Theres no ecchi but there are LOADS of fanservice in this show. You can tell just by watching the first episode. Its even more frequent in the ova&#039;s. Also, the power word for this show is CUTE. I cant emphasize this enough... CUTE is allover.<br />
<br />
For some reason the chemistry between all of them really make for a unique experience. Their character traits sound so standard for a slice of life comedy but the way its executed is far better than most anime of its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review757">
        kind. Every minute you&#039;ll be going &amp;quot;aww&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;omfg how CUTE!&amp;quot; Thats mainly in part by the way the girls react to each other and feed off each others actions/reactions.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is top notch for what its worth... all the girls all have their cute tendancies intact and their voices are just to gaddamn cute *_* Their singing the credits is even good too. Speaking of singing, theres no music whatsoever during the show. Just the seiyu and the enviromental sound effects, with a fair dose of typical comedy sounds. I think absence of the music is just a plan to emphasise how cute the girls are in their &amp;quot;tranquil&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;innocent&amp;quot; enviroments. it does work very well to set off that cute aura that surrounds the entire show.<br />

When i said the power word for this show was &amp;quot;CUTE&amp;quot; the art and animation shows that in spades. First of all you&#039;ll notice the color scheme consists of only pastel spring colors. Even the dark colors like black and brown have that pastel touch to it. Theres so much color that some might even be drowned in the pastel. The enviroment art is half part of how they show how great their cute theme is executed. Every thing from the Chika&#039;s simple bedroom layout with the pink bed sheets and sunflower yellow wall, to the dirty laundry stacked in the laundry basket filled so high sleeves are pouring out the side, down to the different individual lunches ALL the kids in the classroom are eating with their little milk jugs. They even seem to enjoy their art so much that there is quite a few still life shots when they&#039;re showing time is passing. This just shows how much time and effort they put into setting the mood and enviroment for their viewers.<br />
<br />
The character artwork are in a whole nother level than any other anime you&#039;ve seen. Not only do they draw individual background characters with sheer detail and cuteness, but they somehow manage to give the main characters dozens of different costumes to wear. Theres so many, i wouldnt be surprised if there were over 100 costume designs for the girls. The character themsselves are detailed as any high value anime should be. You can also tell this anime has its own art style from the begining. And it works very well showcasing the cuteness of the girls.<br />
<br />
Everything about this show seems to mold together extremely well. When it seems like theres a school comedy, or 2, or 5 every season, Ichigo Mashimaro surely sticks itself out far above the rest. Its a school anime that if you like it, you&#039;ll definitely remember it long after your finished. But if youre not into all that cute loli stuff then by all means, avoid this like the plague. But this is by far one of the best loli anime i&#039;ve ever seen. Too bad im not really into the cute loli anime.<br />

    Excuse me while I gush over this series, it&#039;s almost too cute to bear. I, perhaps, would have overlooked it if it wasn&#039;t for the 3 volumes of the Ichigo Mashimaro manga I have sitting on my shelf. I often find myself not liking the art in the anime if I was exposed to the manga first, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised; the characters in both were drawn very similar, almost identical. The backgrounds lack the detail of other anime, but I can&#039;t say that it bothered me much. <br />
<br />
(If you&#039;ve read the manga, you&#039;ll notice the shuffling of the chapters, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review714">
        anime certainly does not follow the manga faithfully, but that does not detract from the story.)<br />
<br />
The premise is quite simple, we follow 5 girls - Nobue the oldest, her sister Chii, their friends, Ana, Miu and Matsuri - but not continuously, mind you, but rather, we drop in and out of their everyday lives. And what cute lives they lead! Don&#039;t expect complex plot here, each episode is filled with the every day things we all have done, the girls go to school, enjoy cake, shovel snow, get lost and play sports. But it never gets boring, because mischief is just right around the corner and it will have you giggling to yourself over the silliness.<br />
<br />
The simplicity of the plot is the anime&#039;s strong point but also it can be its undoing. If you appreciate the innocent, stress-free and, dare I say again, CUTE things in life, you most likely will love this series, I certainly did. Otherwise, you may find the cuteness tooth-rottingly sweet.

    Ichigo Mashimaro (Strawberry Marshmallow) sticks to the &quot;slice of life&quot; and &quot;comedy&quot; formula without growing stale. Its truly a must see for fans of this genera! <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
Based on the ongoing manga of the same name, basically its about four grade school girls and their big sister (only one is actually related to her, but they all look up to her as one) living life in Japan. I feel I should state at this point that it keeps its story as realistic as possible, so there is no princess to save, no student counsel to form, nothing! This is about everyday life! Which may be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9971">
        a turn off to some fans wanting an actually plot in their shows. Each scene opens up with something different though, such as the girls going on vacation, the big sister on her never ending quest to find a job, the girls making birthday presents for someone special, or them just trying to not make too much noise so another member can sleep! I almost felt like I was watching someones animated home videos about their life sometimes, as apposed to an actual anime. One of the girls is actually from America, so there is plenty of references to both Japanese and American culture made by the girls, which is nice for those of us wanting to learn more about their ways. The story is warm hearted and cute all the way through, though I couldn&#039;t help but feel that if it wasn&#039;t for Miu (main lead) this series would not have been nearly as entertaining. As she is the only real member that actually has a comical personality to her, where as most of the others are more down to earth. While Ichigo doesn&#039;t do anything new with its over all concept, it does indeed to it right! Its soft soothing storyline can either be its greatest feature, or worst, depending on your taste.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack: 8/10<br />
The opening theme has the girls singing a party theme to Ichigo Masimaro, while the ending is the complete opposite, and is sung solo in a soft layed back tone, which fits the anime nicely for its theme. The background music is sparse however, in fact a good portion of the time there really is no BG whatsoever.  And while I do feel it enhances some of the moods in the series overall, it would have been nice to actually have had at least some memorable tracks! Still, what they do have there is good! The Japanese voice cast they got were great however, every girl was matched perfectly with the appropriate voice over. Whether it be Ana&#039;s soft sweet voice or Nobue&#039;s more layed back personality.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
The cast is very likable, while they don&#039;t have the most deep or versatile personalities (like Miu has), they at least never come off as annoying. In fact all the personalities that have been given to each girl is pulled off sweet and charming. They really know how to interact with each other well! <br />
One thing I found to be interesting though, was a lack of supporting characters. The only people you’ll see in this title for the most part are the main cast themselves. (with the exception of some old guy that is used as a running gag, the girls just never seem to give him any peace and quite) This can be seen as both a positive and negative depending on your view point, while I personally loved this feature, some may feel that this might make the story all the more bland. Again, it just depends on your perception of it.  <br />
<br />
Artwork: 7/10<br />
It is soft and cuteness at its best. Nothing is ever &quot;overly&quot; detailed that it comes off as too much for the eyes to take. Color and art are focused on the characters themselves, while the backgrounds look more along the lines of soft water color paintings. It does have a nice appeal to it, but certainly isn&#039;t the most well detailed series out there. As the clothing and backgrounds have a much more plain look to them, still it is nice to look at.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: 9/10<br />
If you like a large cast of characters and a deep storyline in your anime, then it would be best to avoid Ichigo Mashimaro, as this title contains none of those whatsoever. But if your like me and love slice of life anime with a nice realistic layed back sense of humor, then it doesn&#039;t get much better than this! As this title has some of the cutest and most lovable cast you&#039;ll see in one, and will give you a sense of joy and fondness after watching it!

    As specified in the synopsis &amp;quot;cute girls do cute things in cute ways&amp;quot; is what it delivers. Based on the slice of life manga series, the story is considered plotless and instead, viewers are being treated with laughter and uber cuteness by 4 adorable 3rd graders and 1 big sister who just wants to find a decent &#039;good paying&#039; job without being distributed or &#039;attacked&#039; by either one of them, in particular Miu, one of their group members who is &#039;hyper&#039; active. <br />
<br />
From the beginning of the series towards the end, you basically see the activities these girls do on a day to day basis.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review790">
        You see how they socialise and what events they enjoy doing. As you get to know what they like to do, you will start to get to know more about their personalities and maybe relate to one them when you were younger or as of now. Their personalities is so common to the average 3rd grader in the real world, it&#039;s not too hard to fall in love with them and laugh at the things they do and say, in which we may have experienced them in our life time. <br />
<br />
In referring to character development, there isn&#039;t a solid base where we learn about the characters step by step. Instead, we are learning about them in a group while we are laughing and enjoying quality entertainment provided to us. Its how they socialise and the activities they do in which we learn so much about them. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, a series in which is shouldn&#039;t be missed by the young and the old because series like these lifts your mood and gives you a smile on your face each episode of the way.

    Ichigo Mashimaro, in my opinion, is one of the most misunderstood shows out there. Under its loli-clad outer shell, and the too-easily tossed around explanation/catchphrase &quot;cute, not pedo&quot;, the show seems to have given people the impression that it is a moeblob series aimed at pedophiles who like to watch little girls do cute things. For me, and many other fans of the series, that impression couldn&#039;t be more wrong. The true appeal of Ichigo Mashimaro to me, and many others I&#039;ve discussed the show with, is its comedic genius, rooting from Barasui&#039;s source manga and further improved by the excellent anime adaptation. <br />
<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18618">
        can be considered many things. It&#039;s a story of four young girls in elementary school. It&#039;s a story of their older sister. But most of all, it&#039;s funny. The strongest point of the show is its excellent timing of the jokes. From the delivery of one-liners to the repeated Miu on the ground gag, the timing is always near perfect, augmenting the humor all the more. At the same time, the humor restrains itself from becoming a run-of-the-mill, &quot;hurr durr&quot; type of a slapstick show and retains something of a sophisticated feel to it.  Barasui also puts in a fair bit of clever wordplay (one please!) and his own twists into the series, and his efforts in the manga carry right over to the anime.<br />
<br />
However, the anime takes it one step further with its excellent auditory effects. The seiyuus are perfect for each character, especially Chika and Miu whose voices seem to fit their tsukkomi-boke relation perfectly. Ana&#039;s ojousama attitude is conveyed wonderfully, while Matsuri&#039;s helplessness is reflected just as well by the voice actor. The excellent voice acting helps portray the characters the way the manga intended them to be, and as a result improves the comedy - with each character often playing off one another - immensely, adding to the already brilliant character-based humor of the manga. On the other hand, the sound effects, such as the laundry-pole sales man on the megaphone, greatly add to the situational aspects and in establishing the timing in the jokes.<br />
<br />
The characters of Ichigo Mashimaro, while pretty memorable to their own right, are pretty typical of a slice of life series aren&#039;t as impressionable as those in some character-driven series are. However, they are perfect vehicles through which the humor is able to manifest itself, and thus are more than excellent for the show. Would I watch Ichigo Mashimaro if it was cast with a bunch of old men? Probably. But I do admit that the &quot;cuteness&quot; of the show is what brings attention to a show that may otherwise go unnoticed despite its excellence (Hyakko comes to mind). <br />
<br />
So while this show may be famous for is cute (and pedo) factor, I feel many are unaware of what an excellent comedy series this is. So if you&#039;ve neglected the show because of what you think it is, I would strongly suggest you take another look at it, but just watch it with an open mind and don&#039;t expect it to be your typical moeblob anime. <br />
<br />
(PS. Yes, the girls really are cute. Especially in the manga.)

    &quot;her distinguishing trait is that she doesn&#039;t  have any real distinguishing traits&quot;<br />
That&#039;s how i would describe this anime.<br />
I came into it hoping for a decent slice of life anime. I wasn&#039;t expecting gold, but i hoped this would at least make me smile... or chuckle... or something, but it didn&#039;t. Most of the characters are decent. They&#039;re all pretty generic and forgettable but they&#039;re still pleasant. The key word here is most. The problem i had with this anime is Miu, the most annoying character i&#039;ve seen in an anime. There are characters similar to her in other great animes, Azumanga comes to mind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review64613">
        here, but Miu takes it to a whole new level. She&#039;s a selfish, attention seeking brat that made me want to punch her most of the time. I actually found myself asking why she is even friends with the other characters throughout the entire show. She doesn&#039;t actually do anything other than be annoying.<br />
<br />
 This wouldn&#039;t necessarily kill the show alone, but all the jokes are build around her. The show is pretty much about her, so all the jokes are about her as well. I just couldn&#039;t find anything funny when i hate this character so much. Like other characters like Miu, she often ends up face down on the ground when her antics get out of hand, but it doesn&#039;t show her getting hit or anything. It&#039;s not satisfying, and she doesn&#039;t seem affected by it, so it might as well not have happened. <br />
<br />
Since all the &quot;jokes&quot; revolve around Miu, and the other characters are really bland, this show is almost completely empty of anything funny. There are parts without Miu that are enjoyable, but not funny. This show only made me laugh out loud once, and that was the first few minutes of Ana entering the show. That one part if what is keeping me from giving this a 5, or 4, or even something lower.<br />
<br />
At least the plot, artwork, and sound was okay, but nothing to write home about, again, no distinctive features. Apparently, some people actually like Miu, so you might like her as well, but i would strongly suggest staying away.

    There are certain times in your life when you want to just clear your mind of everything and just enjoy the simple things. This is one of those simple things.<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro isn&#039;t action pact, it isn&#039;t full of angst, and it isn&#039;t full of itself. What it is full of is funny little moments, nice moments of friends bonding, and just plain pointlessness.<br />
All of those things are what make this such a great little series. At 12 episodes and three OAV&#039;s it can be watched in one long afternoon.<br />

    I may be biased, but I adore the cute childish slice of life genre so much! <br />
<br />
It&#039;s sweet and funny, there&#039;s just something so comfy about these types of series that really causes me to rewatch them! It&#039;s definitely not a series for everyone, so don&#039;t watch this expecting to give it a 10 if you&#039;re not fond of the genre. The story isn&#039;t super strong (again, it&#039;s a slice of life!), the art is beautiful and is very true to the manga!<br />
<br />
I would recommend this if you like sweet slice of life series such as yotsuba and nichijou ~ I would recommend reading the

    Now, it might seem a bit weird giving an anime a 10 like Ichigo Mashimaro, but this is to be justified. I am rating this on how well it works as a comedy, not as &quot;a masterful piece of visionary art&quot;. Since it is not.<br />
<br />
A master comedy? Why yes, it is.<br />
<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro has an unusual sense of humour and that will be noticeable right off the bat. The story is dependent on timing and the subtlety of the humour. While there are instances of pure crazy slapstick, most of the comedy comes from the sarcastic remarks or the feeling of &quot;yeah, life&#039;s like that&quot; aspect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21094">
        of it.<br />
<br />
The characters completely complement the show. There is Miu, the show stealer who is insane and has ADD, I&#039;m sure of it. Then again, the girl doesn&#039;t forget and holds madly funny grudges, so maybe she has selective or self-inflicted ADD. Her best friend is Chika, a normal girl who gets pissed off for being the only sensible person out of all her friends. What makes Chika great is her chemistry with Miu. They make a good comic dup. Sort of observing everything is Chika&#039;s older sister, Nobue, a college student who drinks, smokes, and loves &quot;moe&quot;. Additionally, there is Ana, a British girl who can&#039;t speak a lick of English and Matsuri, the resident moe blob who can barely stand straight far less function properly in society.<br />
<br />
The jokes are hilarious and tight, the concepts are unual though normal at the same time, and there&#039;s also a bit of emotional, real story in between all the comedy. <br />
<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro is a great series, and highly recommended.

    Story: 5 <br />
There is no general plot for the series, more like slices of life for the 4 children and the adult. Episodes 10 to 12 are quite dull imo. Lies, insensitivity and sabotage are quite commonly fill the episodes, along with cuteness and innocent behaviour.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Is great.<br />
<br />
Sound:7<br />
OP is not bad, a catchy song. ED is a slower, relaxed song, better. Dun think there were a lot of OSTs. And most were dialogues anyway. <br />
<br />
Character:4<br />
Interestingly, only Miu seems to stand out among all the characters in the series. The other 4 main characters mostl;y seem to be led by her actions, or else all the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23243">
        episodes would have no interesting features at all. Take for example eps 10 - 12.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:7<br />
Miu makes most of the entertainment by dramatic (sometimes retarded and ridiculous) actions. Then there is Sazakuya, who always have to stand in the corridor no matter what he does. But cliches like these soon ruin the enjoyment (like Miu&#039;s and Suzukaya&#039;s usual treatments). Plus insensitivities and lame actions sometimes make me wonder if what happened in the series can happen in the first place.<br />
<br />
Overall:6<br />
Initially is quite good, but over the episodes I realised that the jokes seem to be reused over and over again, and lies and misleading information (used for enjoyment) seem not to be corrected to viewers. Some scenes inside are best not to be followed by people in real life (especially for kids around the 6th grade), like the beach incident. Most of the stuff inside this series should be taken with a pinch of salt as well.<br />

    would you rather watch an anime about 12-year old girls, rather than buff spikey haired dudes? If so, Then you came to the right place. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, Have you ever wanted to watch an anime, and just relax, not have to worry about Monster&#039;s blowing up the planet? Something without sad deaths and drama? Something simple and down to earth?  To share a good laugh? This is a show with theme&#039;s of friendship, bonding.  I&#039;ve got a series for you. It&#039;s called...Strawberry Marshmallow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strawberry Marshmallow is a slice of life anime released in 2005. It’s a typical slice of life that focuses on Elementary School

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291096">
        Girls, rather than high schoolers.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I will try and keep this as spoiler free as possible, and not ruin any of the jokes for you)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Plot: The plot is extremely simple, it&#039;s just 4 cute little girls doing cute things. That is literally it. No, there&#039;s no complicated storylines, no god tier enemies, no giant robots, none of that. The series focuses on the daily lives of 4 grade school girls, and their older sister figure, that’s all. Just little girls living out their daily lives, making friends, playing, baking, going to school, and all of it is done realistically as well. Since there is no Plot per se, most of the show relies on the characters and the way they interact with each other to make up the meat of the show. They are really the only focus, the kids, parents are never seen, at all.  It’s actually kind of like an anime version of Peanuts.  Or maybe a Disney or Nickelodeon sitcom (except, you know, actually entertaining.)<br />
<br />
<br />
However, this is one of the major flaws in the series, is how simple it is. One flaw, is that if you aren&#039;t interested in whats happening, you&#039;ll likely be bored with the whole episode, since a whole episode usually focuses on one or 2 plot points. For example, in episode one, after all the introductions, the entire episode is focused on making a birthday present for Nobue, and them trying to stay awake. Which is almost 15 minutes of a 24 minute show, so if you aren&#039;t hooked into the show&#039;s plot, you will probably get bored, since the show does kind of drag at times. But, that&#039;s what you signed up for, to watch these girls go about their daily lives, (Not gonna lie, a couple episodes are outright snoozefests)<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the best parts of the show, is that the events are all done extremely realistically, it&#039;s not like Lucky Star or Nichijou, where they have random references, or bizarre looking action scenes for comedic effect. It&#039;s like something that could be live action as well as animated. It’s kind of like watching someone’s home movies.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plot structure is also fairly basic, it goes A plot, which serves as a catalyst for the B plot, B plot, heartwarming ending, credits. That&#039;s the structure for every episode. For example, in episode 11, the A plot focuses on the upcoming winter and trying to stay warm and kill boredom, and ending with Nobue wanting a hot bath...but let&#039;s just say things don&#039;t go well for her, with the B plot focusing on her and the girls going to a public bath<br />
<br />
<br />
Antoher positive, The show does have some continuity, it starts off in spring, and as the show goes on, the seasons change, other than that subtlety though, it&#039;s purely episodic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Characters: In general, Each character is very dynamic. Plus, they are also written very realistically, they behave and react like normal children, and have an appropriate amount of intelligence for a child as well, they are portrayed as usually being  wrong-headed but well-meaning, or applying incredible talent and creativity to a completely asinine pursuit, A good comparision would be Peanuts, which also does this well, as both have the cast often making pretty intellectual observations of their very grounded, mundane lives. It&#039;s certainly better then most modern sitcoms,like Modern Family, that go way too far in making the children witty and self-aware,<br />
<br />
<br />
There character&#039;s themselves are<br />
 Chika, whose more of the bland audience surrogate with no personality, that pretty much all anime have as the lead. And that&#039;s not just my opinion, that&#039;s really how the show describes her.<br />
<br />
Matsuri, who is somewhat gullible, very shy, and a bit of an airhead (Heck, she&#039;s 11 and still believes in Santa claus).She really serves no other purpose, except to scream and cry anytime something bad happens. To be honest, She&#039;s a bit annoying, and certainly my least favorite character.<br />
<br />
 Ana, a girl from england, but she speaks no english.. .seriously, the running gag of her speaking broken english is quite hilarious. (One please scene).  That and She&#039;s  pretty assimilated to Japan, and even knows more about Japanese culture then her native friends, <br />
<br />
Miu, who serves as a tomboyish, perverted, problem child. She is always playing elaborate pranks on her friends, and out of all the girls, she&#039;s the most memorable. Also, most conflicts in the story are caused by her antics, and  while she can be annoying to some,  she is definitely the best part of this show.<br />
<br />
And lastly, is Nobue. CHika&#039;s 20 year old sister, who&#039;s pretty cool and serves as somewhat of a leader. fun fact: in the manga, she is 16, but she constantly smokes and drinks, and since this is a show geared towards a younger audience, that never would&#039;ve flown with the censors. (Note: In japan, the smoking and drinking age is 20). Also, another funny running gag that this adult has to constantly borrow money from her kid sister. Makes you wonder what she really does with all her money? (Clip chop dollar) <br />
<br />
The cast is very likable, while they don&#039;t have the most deep or versatile personalities , they at least never come off as annoying. In fact all the personalities that have been given to each girl is pulled off sweet and charming. They really know how to interact with each other well! <br />
<br />
<br />
Comedy: Ichigo Mashimaro’s Humor is dependent on timing and the subtlety of the humor. While there are instances of pure crazy slapstick, most of the comedy comes from the sarcastic remarks or the feeling of &quot;yeah, that’s life&quot; <br />
<br />
But, there also is a heavy emphasis on perverted humor, which might be a turn off to some people, so watch at your own peril. And Keep in mind, these girls are 11 and 12, so the Fbi might show up at your door if you watch this. Miu is pretty common with these jokes, but there also is Nobue. Nobue is a lolicon (someone who likes loli&#039;s, aka cute girls). The way she reacts to how these girls behave is a bit concerning. Like how she reacts to Ana<br />
<br />
It is quite unsettling, because she makes them dress in cute costumes and do other weird things. It is pretty creepy sometimes, so just a heads up. Oh, and also,  be careful of the Loli police when watching this,<br />
<br />
The strongest point of the show is its excellent timing of the jokes. From the delivery of one-liners to the repeated Miu on the ground gag, the timing is always near perfect, augmenting the humor all the more<br />
<br />
<br />
Audio: THe opening theme is very joyous and upbeat, with  clips of the girls just hanging out and trying on costumes, and certainly gets you in the mood for a lighthearted comedy and the adventures that await you<br />
<br />
However, The ending theme is a complete contrast, it is slow and somewhat of a somber piece, with slow panning shots of Chika&#039;s room. It does help you wind down, though.<br />
<br />
As for music in the show itself, it&#039;s largely mute. There very rarely is music, and the music itself primarily features piano. Music is used very sparingly and saved for only certain key scenes, like sappy heart to heart talks.  Aside from that, it&#039;s mostly just sound effects, of nature.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the voice acting, which is pretty good. Each character sounds different, and their voices match their appearance and personality very well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: The animation flows very well, there is very little looping or repeating of scenes. Plus, all backgrounds are very detailed, as are the characters, which all have unique designs  are definitely show off the Moe aestetic. (Moe = Cute)<br />
<br />
The backgrounds are also very nice to look at as well. <br />
<br />
the color scheme consists of only pastel spring colors. Even the dark colors like black and brown have that pastel touch to it. Theres so much color that some might even be drowned in the pastel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eyecatches: The eyecatches are fairly unique, they aren&#039;t just the typical ones with a character&#039;s face and the show&#039;s logo found in most <br />
The music is a quick jingle, and The photoes are all closeups of Nobue trying on different outfits, like goggles, headphones, shoes. But, then you have the one for the first 5 episodes, it&#039;s just a closeup on Nobue&#039;s bottom in a skirt, and then her crotch in a pair of unbutton jeans <br />
<br />
I got nothing, just that...Japan is weird.<br />
<br />
<br />
Manga Vs. Anime: the manga ran for 7 volumes, and is a bit different then the actual show, that you need to be aware of. First of all, <br />
<br />
Since the series is an episodic format, they can shuffle the stories around a bit and not ruin any sort of overarching plot, so the episode order is actually somewhat different from the manga ((For example, the chapter &quot;Bath&quot;, in the manga it happens fairly early, but in the anime, it&#039;s one of the final episodes)). And some stories from the manga are omitted from the anime. <br />
<br />
Plus, in the manga, Ana was not introduced until volume 2 of the manga. So, in the manga, she won&#039;t be featured in early stories. But, in the anime, Ana was introduced in the second episode, so in the anime, when adapting stories from volume 1,  they add her to stories she wasn&#039;t present in. There&#039;s also some minor differences. <br />
<br />
LIke certain lines of dialogue. There&#039;s one piece of dialogue changed that ruins a piece of continuity and a character.<br />
<br />
Like the chapter &quot;Job&quot;, where Nobue works as a waitress, long story short, Miu gets her fired. THen, the next chapter focuses on the girls going grocery shopping, and while shopping, Nobue decides to buy the girls snacks. However, When Miu picks hers, Nobue immediately puts it back on the shelf, but buys something for the rest of the girls.<br />
<br />
Now, In the manga, Nobue flat out tells her she&#039;s being punished for getting her fired, however in the anime she does it, seeming out of pure malition. (Play clip) Yeah, that&#039;s really the only explanation she give. And then she just insults her for no reason. (Flat chest)<br />
<br />
It just paints Nobue as mean spirited, which she&#039;s not, so they kind of made her out of character here. Which is very annoying to me, as Nobue is my favorite character.<br />
<br />
All in all, If you enjoy the series, check out the manga, , since it features some extra stories that didn&#039;t make it into the anime<br />
<br />
<br />
The Dub: Oh boy, the dub. Where do i begin?<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s not the worst english dub i&#039;ve heard, but it could certainly have been better. <br />
<br />
Fun fact, the voice actresses for the dub were around the same age as the actual characters, which i found unique, since most anime feature adults doing the voices of children.<br />
<br />
Although it may be unique, it doesn&#039;t make it good. The voices are for the little girls are very generic and don&#039;t fit the characters, especially Miu and Nobue (Play clips compare)<br />
<br />
The delivery is extremely wooden, with no emotion at all. (Just about to eat and Hey that&#039;s me)<br />
<br />
Also, the dub does handle certain things &quot;interestingly&quot;<br />
<br />
For example, some scenes in the original have the characters speaking in english, in the dub they still speak english in these scenes, but they go from speaking like normal to talking in broken english, which can be kind of confusing if you watch the dub first and don&#039;t know when they are supposed to be speaking english or not. (very pretty from 3)<br />
Also, Ana&#039;s dog is named Frusciante, named after John Frusciante of Red hot chili peppers. one scene features Nobue calling out to the dog, and butchering it&#039;s name, here it is in Japanese, <br />
<br />
WHich is pretty close, since Frusciante might be tough for some people to pronounce, so it&#039;s understandable, however, in the dub, it doesn&#039;t even come close<br />
<br />
I think this was just an excuse to say &quot;Shite&quot; on a kids show.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: Do i recomend this series? It&#039;s cute,  , it&#039;s funny, and is pretty unique in it&#039;s own right, it&#039;s a very upbeat, feel good style anime. Plus it&#039;s only got 17 episodes (counting the ova&#039;s), so you might be able to breeze through it in a week. You should enjoy it if you like really down to earth, simple, slice of life. Or, if you just need a break of action and drama heavy series. Even if your only exposure to anime is shonen and toonami, like i used to be, then try to step out of your comfort zone and give it a shot, you might actually enjoy it.<br />
<br />
However, if you want something similar, but with more surrealist and outlandish humor, you may want to check out Nichijou or Azumanga Daioh (when mention azumanga, include swine flu photo, ) instead.<br />
<br />
But, keep in mind everything i&#039;ve said, when deciding to pick this show up. If Loli and pervy humor doesn&#039;t bother you, then it&#039;s worth a shot, i&#039;d highly recommend it.  , the power word for this show is CUTE. I cant emphasize this enough... CUTE is allover. Also,  try to watch the original subbed first, rather then the dub. <br />
<br />
<br />
if your like me and love slice of life anime with a nice realistic laid back sense of humor, then it doesn&#039;t get much better than this! As this title has some of the cutest and most lovable cast you&#039;ll see in one, and will give you a sense of joy and fondness after watching it!

    Does anyone else play the random anime game, when you find a long list of series, close your eyes, and then pick one randomly? That&#039;s how I was introduced to Ichigo Mashimaro. Normally, I never go with the choice I pick, if I get tired in the first five minutes, I&#039;ll change it. However, when I first heard the theme song, I was almost immediatly hooked. <br />
<br />
I thoroughly loved every character and episode. The fact that it was nearly random on each episode made it easier for me; I didn&#039;t need to remember everything about the last episode to understand the one I was watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36308">
        currently. <br />
<br />
My least favorite thing about the series? The amount of Engrish was nearly enough to make me wanna cry. Call this weird, but I&#039;m also slightly dissappointed in the ferret&#039;s screen time. While I typically don&#039;t care about animals in anime (unless, of course, I&#039;m watching Fruits Basket) when they are seen in the opening, I had high hopes of seeing that weasel! D8<br />
<br />
But, despite my unusual expectations, I loved this series. Something I will defiantly force my friends to watch. :)

     When I first heard of this anime, I was about 10. <br />
Ever since then, I&#039;ve always wanted to see it. <br />
Now that I have, I have to thank my past self for taking interest in it.<br />
<br />
Story(8/10) <br />
The story is not very set, but it&#039;s a great series to watch if you don&#039;t want commitment or just need to kill some time. (Not necessarily a bad thing!)<br />
<br />
Art(9/10)<br />
The art is pretty cute, a plus if you like the &#039;moe&#039; style.<br />
The animation or anatomy never flips out or is half-assed (unless I just didn&#039;t notice), and it flows pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
Sound(9/10)<br />
While the site that I watched this on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25909">
        didn&#039;t really provide me with the best quality ever, I could still hear and see everything. And you have to admit, the voice actors really pulled-off that little kid-ness!<br />
<br />
Character(8/10)<br />
While the characters are very fun to look at, I wouldn&#039;t necessarily say they were the most original.<br />
You&#039;ve got the energetic, bossy girl, we have the foreign blond exchange student, the timid meganekko, the person who gets dragged along, and the sane-man. <br />
Additional things are at least added to enhance hilarity, but for the most part, they&#039;re so-so in originality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10/10)<br />
I&#039;ve gotta say, it didn&#039;t take me long at all to finish this series; I latched onto it until the very end.<br />
The humor is fantastic and cute, and each episode flows pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
Overall(9/10)<br />
Although I did have lots of fun with this show, unfortunately it still gets a nine. I was really disappointed that it didn&#039;t last very long, I could have gone for a second season!

    I&#039;m going to make this review short and sweet.<br />
<br />
This anime is very fun to watch, it&#039;s very similar to Nichijou by KyoAni in terms of animation, characters and plot. <br />
<br />
In fact, it should be the other way around. Nichijou is very similar to this. Since Ichigo Mashimaro is a 2005 anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m very impressed at how this anime balances humor, cuteness and dense jokes together! If you&#039;ve watched Nichijou, I&#039;d say this is like Nichijou but without the added wierdness.<br />
<br />
Mio from Nichijou is like Chika-chan<br />
Yuuko is like Miu<br />
Matsuri is like.. well, nano the robot? or the teacher Izumi from Nichijou?<br />
<br />
Sorry if I&#039;m drawing alot of referencesto

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326499">
        nichijou but it is how it is.<br />
<br />
Overall, I just want to be blatantly honest and say that as a slice of life, this anime may not appeal to everyone, as most people like a story that is actually driven by the plot. But even if you aren&#039;t into slice of life anime, there is something in Nichijou for everyone to enjoy.<br />
<br />
However, if you enjoy Slice of life like nichijou, lucky star etc or episodic mini stories with slapstick jokes, I highly recommend you watch it!<br />
<br />

    I&#039;d heard good things about this show, and honestly, I&#039;d hoped for a fun time in watching it. However, I took a risk in doing so that ultimately did not pay off: I watched the english dub before watching the origional sub. I can&#039;t stress enough the sad state of the dubbing for this show. The character&#039;s voices are whiny and bring about a total lack of interest in whatever cutesy slice-of-life story happens to be going on at the time. Granted, I didn&#039;t make it very far, but I just couldn&#039;t. Perhaps if I had seen it subbed things would be different, but I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5170">
        just can&#039;t bring myself to do it now. You may have a better experience with this anime than I did; maybe it&#039;s all a matter of taste (though bear in mind, slice-of-life is a personal favorite of mine). If you do see it subbed and enjoy it, please let me know so maybe I won&#039;t miss out. As of right now, however, Ichigo Masimaro is about the last anime on my mind.

Yeah, the overarching theme I see in reviews in descriptions is &quot;cute girls doing cute things in cute ways&quot;. PRETTY much sums up the entire show in that simple statement. It&#039;s hard to really comment on the story, because even shows like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh have them progressing through high school whereas Ichigo Mashimaro is pretty much just &quot;4 Elementary School girls, older sister, annnnnnnnd go!&quot;. It&#039;s definitely lighthearted and very easygoing, you need to be patient and relaxed to really enjoy this anime. When you are in the mood for intense action, this is not your go-to. Given

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233148">
        that, the stories are simple slice of life (this show epitomizes that statement, IMO) and stick to it. Nobue gets a job, the girls go to the beach, everyone goes to a bath house...don&#039;t expect FMA: Brotherhood or Kuragehime style storylines here at all. That having been said, it&#039;s sweet seeing all the stuff they do and want to do together. You have to look at kids and go &quot;Aww, how cute&quot; to really &quot;get&quot; this anime. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m no expert on art, but the show seemed well done. The girls were drawn well and looked very cute. Nobue kind of had a strange look to her, but not many other adults did, it could just be her expressions though. The environments looked good and everything was smooth, it was an easy anime to watch and looked realistic enough. Nothing mind blowing as there weren&#039;t many visuals to highlight, so this got a good but not perfect. It didn&#039;t take any risks, but at least it looked good doing it. <br />
<br />
Now let me preface this by saying I typically judge an anime&#039;s &quot;sound&quot; rating off how good the dub is, if one exists. The theme song and the sub version is what saved this anime BIG TIME. I don&#039;t care how lazy you are, avoid the dub at ALL COSTS. It was terrible, ill-timed, and just downright annoying. I was 2 episodes in and switched to the sub, sooo glad I did. Even though I don&#039;t speak a lick of Japanese, I could tell the cadence of their voice acting in the Japanese version was way better. That part aside, the theme song was cute and really catchy. I have it stuck in my head soooo often. Ichigo Love!!! :-)<br />
<br />
Usually it relies on the characters to make a slice of life enjoyable and fun to watch. Classic archetypes were present here, but I feel some of them just had the volume turned down on them. Miu was the loudest and most outgoing character by far. She is comical and a necessary part of the genre to give it movement, but sometimes you want her to shut up for just a minute or two. She has a purpose and definitely asserts her place in the series. Chika is the straight man, which is fine, but she just comes off as grumpy as opposed to just being the regular do-gooder. I kind of wish she had more character development outside of yelling at Miu and calling her sister a bum (even though she is). We had one episode that delved a bit into her psyche, but I feel she deserved more than one episode. Despite popular opinion, Matsuri was my favorite for a few reasons. She is the adorable, helpless one and her gentle spirit make her an ideal character for this genre and setting. Her shy nature was very cute and it was nice to see her go and do everyday stuff (especially with John!). Ana was another character that didn&#039;t get much screen time like Chika. She kinda came off as a crybaby and didn&#039;t get much development done for her. There was some OTHER &quot;development&quot; they mentioned, but I&#039;ll come back to that later. Nobue was well...kind of a drag. I get that her personality is blase and lazy, but sometimes she felt like a weak plot point that wasted time. The diner episode was a great setup though and couldn&#039;t be done without her. She is an ok character, but one I felt could have been better written or developed. She &quot;got her kicks in&quot; on the final episode, which was cool...plus the constantly knocking out Miu is pretty funny. <br />
<br />
So enjoyment, yeesh where do I start? I did enjoy this anime a fair amount, but I felt there was some fan service and NOT in a good way. If I&#039;m watching a show about little girls in elementary school, I get REALLY uncomfortable and upset when they try to do any sexualizing of them. Nobue is in college, I could understand some fan service concerning her (the beach episode prank with Miu), but the girls are too young and it&#039;s really messed up to do something like that in my opinion. Seeing them do cute everyday stuff and just enjoying life is a great thing to be a part of, if you have nieces or something of that nature, this could remind you of them. I had two girls that they reminded me of and it was kinda funny seeing all the activities and such play out. It&#039;s a lighthearted storyline so don&#039;t expect massive excitement in any way, you need to be in the right mood to watch this. <br />
<br />
So overall, this got about the same rating I gave Tenchi Muyou. This had a lot of potential that seemed to be missed by lack of character development, SOME weak plot premises, and inappropriate fan service that just creeped me out. With these things fixed, this could have easily gotten a 9. I know some of the story tropes are staples for SoL (beach, bathhouse, etc.) but some of the content needed to be toned down on the sexual tangents. For Pete&#039;s sake, they are ELEMENTARY AGE GIRLS for crying out loud...can&#039;t we just let them be cute and innocent without trying to add perverted content in there? All in all, if SoL is your thing and you like genuinely cute little girls doing cute things, this seems like a great one to watch. Skip the dub, just trust me, and try to overlook the pervert stuff.

    So it took me some time to finish this anime, primarily because of the major annoyances that this show has present in every episode. Although I dig layed back slice of life shows, and how this story has underlying themes about the importance of childhood and how certain attitudes are helpful that tend to be lost in adulthood, but it does not present these themes in an enjoyable way. I was recommended this show as a comedy and I literally only got 2 jokes out of this that were funny out of 12 episodes, and those jokes were used way too much. I honestly dont

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320836">
        care anymore about this series but the main problem in my opinion of this show is the girl with the pig tails, the driving force of this show. She is ssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo infuriating and annoying. I literally would pause for minutes to just cuss her out for being so stupid. In conclusion, this show tries to address themes that are pretty important to consider, but just does it in a very shallow and annoying way.

    Not gonna lie, when first jumping into this series I thought it was gonna be another slice of life in the &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; genre, but as I watched more and more I came to realize that it had something that most shows lack, it had a &quot;soul&quot;, it&#039;s something ineffable, it genuinely blow my expectations, almost as much as seeing kids in a year post 2020 playing outside. It&#039;s no masterpiece but it made me laugh out loud more than one time so it definitely did something right, my cold dead heart definitely appreciates this as a reminder that not everything in

Welcome everybody to the house of fun and also welcome to my review of Strawberry Marshmallow,which as the title suggests is so cute it can cause rotten teeth and obesity.<br />
<br />
So what is this anime all about then?<br />
<br />
The answer to that would be.....Nothing..It&#039;s another SOL-Moe anime garnished with the comedic bodily fluids of the chef.Which i&#039;m sure many of you like very very much indeed.<br />
<br />
And since i don&#039;t have to bother with the story part i can go on and talk characters..The cast for better or worse isn&#039;t a vast one,you only have to do with 5 characters.These characters would be Nobue(the older sister),Chika(the younger sister)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287685">
        and then Chika&#039;s friends Miu,Matsuri and Ana.<br />
<br />
Now i thought-as many of you will too i&#039;m sure-that with such small cast the anime would be epic..I&#039;m sad to report that this isn&#039;t the case.This anime for starters tries to be something other than itself,it tries hard to be like Azumanga Daioh.And Azumanga was a total waste of time if you ask me.Sure it paved the way for other anime of this type but i&#039;m not sure this is a good thing in the first place.And although this has-in a way-its own character it ends up as a mere shadow of Azu.<br />
<br />
The problem lies first and foremost within the characters themselves.The only character that was doing the heavy lifting was Miu.She was,and i&#039;m not exaggerating one bit,the driving force behind almost everything in this anime..Whatever comedic elements were prevelant in SM were a product of Miu&#039;s actions..All the rest of the cast had to do was follow the lead,and it&#039;s not like they did such a good job anyway cause the end result was a tad boring.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong,this show was funny 70% of the time or less..But by pushing almost all the effort towards one character and then Nobue to a lesser extent,things go down faster than a burning aeroplane.The jokes themselves were a mixed bag and the only thing that kept them from dying altogether was very clever use of timing and brilliant voice acting on the part of Orikasa Fumiko.Honestly i think her delivery played a major role and since Miu was the center of attraction in this anime voice was bound to be an important part.<br />
<br />
Matsuri is little more your standard cute,shy little kitten always doing her own thing..Being invisible that is..Then there was Ana who is a foreigner(never been done before)who for some reason wanted to make her life hard just for the fuck of it,which wasn&#039;t funny in the least,instead it was sad to watch.Chika was,i think,the only one that could barely keep up with Miu,aside from her sister.<br />
<br />
But as i said take out Nobue&#039;s and Chika&#039;s little bright moments they couldn&#039;t hold a candle to Miu..And that was the demise of SM cause after a while the comedy hit rock bottom and by the time you&#039;ve reached the final third even the bad jokes were a nice distant memory.They did try to replace the comedy with some FEELS MAN THE FEELS but to no avail.This dead horse was more beaten than Rihanna when she was with Chris Brown.<br />
<br />
One other problem i spotted was pacing.This anime felt longer than it actually was.Seriously there were times where nothing was happening.Whole scenes where everyone was sitting around a table doing and saying absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
And another one was that despite its random humour it was more than obvious that it was trying too hard.You could guess with a 100% accuracy what was coming next and that isn&#039;t good at all.It came close to ruining the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Which all brings me on to this..Being cute doesn&#039;t mean jackshit.If you don&#039;t have anything else to offer other than moe then off you go to the long dead and forgotten anime cemetery.It was a fun anime make no mistake but in the end it couldn&#039;t stand on its&#039; own 2 feet and its&#039; value fell faster than Venezuela&#039;s economy.<br />
