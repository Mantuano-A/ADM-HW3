    This is very much adequately Poggers. The songs used in this are just *chef kiss*. The environment this creates is uncanny, and just insane! 10/10, must watch. The main character is cute, and she starts out knowing nothing about DJing. And as the story continues, I&#039;m sure that she will become a Pro. And hopefully master wotagei. All of the characters are cute, and have their own discrete personalities. But the music used is just amazing. I love it omg. Can&#039;t stop listening/vibing to da tunes! Hopefully they add in some Kanye West or some Drum and Bass down the line!

    Do you like good music and cute girls? Do you love the bands from “BanG Dream!”? If so, then D4DJ is the perfect anime for you! <br />
Bushiroad is a very well-known name in the mobile gaming industry, the team brought us &quot;Love Live!&quot;, &quot;BanG Dream!&quot; or also &quot;Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight&quot;. &quot;D4DJ&quot; is their new project which includes different DJ groups who want to be in the big spotlight one day as well.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word “DJ”? <br />
I always associate this term with people like &quot;David Guetta&quot;, &quot;Alan Walker&quot; or &quot;Avicii&quot; (R.I.P, you were a legend).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376373">
        Everyone knows and love them. With their music, they not only changed the music world, but also made our everyday lives happier. <br />
<br />
Our little DJ anime focuses on the everyday life of the unit “Happy Around!”, the central unit for the D4DJ franchise. Rinku, our always happy girl, is the one who started the band. The name for &quot;Happy Around!&quot; also came from her habit of yelling the phrase while joyfully spinning around. She is always cheerful, optimistic and never gives up. After her first encounter with Maho, she became interested in the whole DJ project. <br />
Deeply moved by a DJ performance she had seen in her past, Maho became interested in DJ activities herself. She is the DJ in the unit and also doing the track-mixing. Although not very enthusiastic about the whole thing in the beginning, Rinku convinced her in the end to form a unit with her. The skills of &quot;DJ Mash&quot; have become even better as a result.<br />
The third girl in the unit is Muni, she has been with friends with Rinku since childhood and was really happy to reunite with her in high school after Rinku&#039;s family frequently moved around the world. Muni is responsible for the VJing in the unit. She is very close to the fourth and last member of the unit: Rei.<br />
Rei was born into a wealthy family and is very talented in many things, of which playing the piano makes her most happy. Before meeting Rinku, she lived the life her parents had prepared for her, but didn&#039;t have the courage to make a change. Rei is very grateful for her chance encounter with Rinku, who instilled more confidence in her.<br />
From starting the unit with Rinku&#039;s commitment to their daily training sessions and even participating in the competition at the end of the day, we experience all of these beautiful moments. All the girl get along with each other, even not being in the same unit. They just have fun together. It&#039;s a classic, pleasant slice-of-life anime with nice music.<br />
<br />
In this show we experience how wonderful DJ music can be. We don&#039;t just hear the music from &quot;Happy Around!&quot; , but also from the other units like &quot;Peaky P-key&quot; or &quot;Photo Maiden&quot;. Each unit has a different direction in terms of the songs and their appearance. The OP already gives you a heavy DJ vibe while the ED is just beautiful listen to, it&#039;s relaxed and exciting at the same time.<br />
<br />
Why did I mention “BanG Dream!” in the beginning? Not only because of the same producer and studio, but also the art style is very similar to them. Even some of the voice actors from “BanG Dream” are a part of this DJ project as well. The 3D CGI is very well presented as well although I feel a little bit sad for the background characters since the difference can be spot directly. But you definitely can feel the “BanG Dream!” vibe in this anime directly. The characters and musical directions are very similar. It&#039;s just fun to watch and listen to our girls playing their music.<br />
<br />
Besides the good music and the cute girls, I was also able to learn something about DJing. Never read or experienced anything about that before, some basics about it is also explained to us in this anime. As a big “BanG Dream” fan I was already pretty hyped after seeing the trailer, it reminded me right away. If you loved that one, you will like this one for sure! <br />
In the end, I really hope we will get a second season. We all want to learn more about this DJ project and the other units as well!<br />

    the fresh beats slap, like a spanish mom with a flip flop, i watch every episode the second they come out, this anime has taken a spot in my favourites it is just simply pengin&#039; and i cant wait for more! and the one with the black and yellow hair is pretty peng. also the intro is lit, it goes dun dun dun dee doo duh duh wicky wicky dene duna dun dun or something like that i don&#039;t know but its a banger though and it&#039;s fun to watch too, the visuals are cool as balls. i personally think that there should be some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364729">
        guest appearances from famous musicians, such as: bruno mars, yung gravy, xxx tentacion or the fold (creators of weekend whip: lego ninjago op 1) that would just be really cool i think.<br />

    Today I&#039;ll be giving my thoughts on Bushiroad&#039;s newest media project after BanG Dream!, D4DJ First Mix. This show is really great, and I&#039;ll get into why it&#039;s so great in this review. Let&#039;s get into specifics.<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Since MyAnimeList hasn&#039;t really done a proper synopsis of this show, I&#039;ll do it myself. The show follows a high school girl named Rinku, who has just recently moved back to Japan after living in Africa for years. The high school she attends, in a deviation from the standard music-centric anime, is big on DJs rather than idols. Rinku becomes enamored with DJing, meeting an unpopular DJ at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376453">
        her school named Maho, who begins to teach Rinku about DJing. Rinku and Maho eventually get together with 2 other girls at their high school, Muni and Rei, to form the idol group known as Happy Around!. The show follows the group of girls as they try to rise up the ranks of the school, along with their interactions with other school DJ groups Peaky P-Key and Photon Maiden. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty standard as far as music-centric shows go, as it doesn&#039;t too anything exceptional. However, what it does is still quite solid. It revolves around Rinku and the gang climbing up the ranks of DJ groups in their high school. It is a pretty straightforward plot, but it still manages to be engaging through the music and character interactions. It&#039;s pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of the plot, but there are some drama elements sprinkled in. These drama elements are pretty good and add some more flavor to the plot. The story manages to back in plot, character development, and music in each episode without feeling off in the slightest. The pacing is good, however, for some reason, the first few episodes would sometimes have moments of silence or lingering on the same shot for too long, which was pretty jarring. Luckily, the studio behind this show, SANZIGEN, seemed to have realized this early on, as that is really only in the first few episodes. The concept of a DJ anime intrigued me into watching it and it most certainly delivers on that interesting premise. The show gives actually good insight on DJing. I learned things about it that I never knew. I bet this show will get some viewers interested in DJing.<br />

Art: 9<br />
I know what you all are thinking: &quot;A CG anime having great animation? What is this guy on?&quot; I&#039;ll admit, I too was originally concerned by the fact that this show is 3DCG animated, but all my doubts were put to rest by the very first episode. The CG is really great, probably the best I&#039;ve ever seen in an anime. The characters move very fluidly, not looking janky at all, unlike many other 3DCG anime. The characters&#039; faces are super expressive, perfectly displaying a wide range of emotions. The CG is especially impressive during the music sequences, as the animators go all out in making the dancing look authentic, the lip movement match with the lyrics, and the lighting look very visually appealing. The only gripe I have with the animation is the very little instances of traditional animation. They contrast quite a lot with the CG characters. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Now this is probably the most appealing aspect of this show. To be blunt, this show has some of the freshest and sickest beats I&#039;ve ever heard in an anime. Unlike idol music, which often sounds somewhat rinse-and-repeat, every DJ group&#039;s music is uniquely crafted to their image. All the group&#039;s music is easily distinguishable from each other due to their defined styles. This also allows for viewers to more easily pick favorites, but honestly, all the music is so good that I can&#039;t decide what my favorite group is. All of the music is very catchy and just a great listen. I personally listen to music from this show very often because it&#039;s so good. Even the background music is good, having the same techno cues that the main songs do. As for the voice acting, it is also of high quality. All of the voices have a unique sound to them and are very expressive. As for the opening and ending songs, they are very good. The opening performed by Happy Around! themselves, Guru Guru DJ TURN!!, is a very catchy and upbeat tune. The same goes for the ending song by Airi Amano (Nana Mizuki) and Shano Himegami (Raychell), titled, and this is a long one, WOW WAR TONIGHT ~ Toko ni wa Okoseyo Movement. I found myself never skipping these great songs.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The character development in this show is also quite good. All 4 of the main characters&#039; personality and emotions are well explored. You really get a sense of how these characters feel and you begin to care about them. This show also includes 8 side characters, 4 from Peaky P-Key and 4 from Photon Maiden. While they obviously receive less development from the main cast, some of them are still well developed. Kyoko and Shinobu of Peaky P-Key and Saki of Photon Maiden have especially good characterization out of the 8 side characters. All the characters are filled with expressiveness, making their interactions with each other a blast to watch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
This is some of the most fun I&#039;ve had watching an anime in 2020 (and a bit of 2021). I often found myself with a smile on my face while watching it. I looked forward to each and every song and character interaction every week. Watching it was a fantastic part of each Friday it aired.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
Even with a few small gripes, D4DJ First Mix manages to be an entertaining ride, jam-packed with great visuals, good characterization, and absolutely sublime music. Giving the music genre a fresh DJ twist, it keeps you entertained throughout the entirely of its 13-episode season. I highly recommend anyone to watch this show. This show is probably the most accessible one I&#039;ve watched, as it&#039;s on a ton of different services. For North Americans such as myself, it&#039;s available on Crunchyroll, Funimation, HiDive, Anime Network, and even YouTube for viewers worldwide.

    D4DJ is a multimedia project I have been following for a bit less than a year before the TV series started, my excitement towards the anime was huge, and I&#039;m really happy to say that not only it was nice, but it also surpassed my expectations.<br />
<br />
This anime follows the cheerful Rinku and her new (and not that new) friends as they form a DJ unit in a school very heavily focused on that activity (the funds spent on that big-ass beautiful building and all the rooms with equipment to do DJ performances must have been crazy). As the episodes pass, they will meet new rivals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376378">
        that will both bring a bigger challenge to overcome, and also become friends that will help out each other to improve even further.<br />
<br />
One of the most important things to mention is that this is one of the rare music anime that is not really focused on drama, the characters do have problems and sad moments, but they all get resolved without being dragged out more than needed. I sure love a good drama, but I personally loved how D4DJ managed to have emotional moments while mostly just being an anime focused on sheer fun and good vibes.<br />
<br />
Now time to take on a part that is usually very controversial for the anime watchers but that really shouldn&#039;t be the case for this anime: CGI animation. SANZIGEN is a studio focused on anime of this type, and as someone who watched how Bang Dream from that same studio drastically improved between the second and third season in terms of CGI quality, I can say that D4DJ now took it not one but three steps further to become one of the best looking works using that style of animation. It makes me so happy to read so many people who are not a fan of CGI say that they found this anime to look great and not feel uncanny as they usually feel. With that said, I have to admit that the background chars suffer from generic face syndrome, but how well the main cast looks and expresses their emotions, and how great the performances are make up for it hard.<br />
<br />
As a music anime, one has to indeed give a lot of value to the music, and nothing to worry about, because this anime covers that section nicely as well! Nearly every episode has a new song (or two) that make you spam on loop on youtube after watching it due to how nice it sounded, and the normal soundtrack that plays during the series is also very solid and memorable. Not fully related, but since series about DJ performances are close to none, I really liked how D4DJ made sure to show the basics of how it works so one can make an idea about what the characters are doing and not just feel clueless with what the task of a DJ is.<br />
<br />
I have to give its own paragraph to the opening song of this anime because it not only sounds fantastic and shows how good the CGI of this anime is, it also fits so well with the theme of DJ performances this work focuses on. Guru Guru DJ TURN!! Really can be seen as three different songs transitioning one after the other, and this (groovy) mix delivers hard to make it one of the best openings from 2020. Make sure to check it out if you haven&#039;t yet!<br />
<br />
Sadly we&#039;re now reaching the end of this review, I hope I managed to convince you to give this series a chance! I glossed it over to not go full on detail, but while I really enjoy the music, what makes me truly love D4DJ is its lovable cast full of different personalities that just work greatly together (or become closer after struggling due to their ways to be), I&#039;m sure that if you watch this anime you will end up feeling the same way and will want to see more of them. At the time of this review, we will be getting chibi shorts starting the week after to fix that, hopefully sequels will be coming soon as well!

    Love the music and really good decent story nothing like or same old style plot like allot ,this is all original story line about how DJ&#039;s do and go through for there jobs and in the industry plus love the music in it.<br />
 <br />
I don&#039;t like how the back ground NPC&#039;s in show have different art work, which is a pity as the main Characters have great 2d-3d key visuals. <br />
<br />
Hope this show guys at least 2 sessions and allot of people watch it and it gets a English dub <br />
<br />
But overall the show has started off great and mixes in great for all ages

    DJD4 was the last season that came out in the Fall season of 2020, and arguably it was one of the better ones of the season itself. If I could rate it 7.5, I honestly would, though it deserves the rating I am giving it now, as D4DJ deserves a lot of love for a number of reasons, let me explain.<br />
<br />
Normally I&#039;d put all these separate, but because sound is very important to the show, and the characters are main highlight, from Happy Around, to Photon Maiden, to Peaky P.Even minor supporting characters are good within this show. All of it all blends together to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376377">
        make for a very entertaining watch, let me explain.<br />
<br />
The story follows a girl named Rinku, who has transferred to this school after moving back to Japan after spending time in Africa, and ends up meeting a girl named Maho, all because of music, wishing to create music together. They later bring Rinku&#039;s childhood friend in Mumi into the mix, along with another friend they meet in Rei and form the group Happy Around, with the goal of playing and creating music together, but also competing at Sunset stage. But of course it&#039;s not an easy ride, as there are many bumps along the way, but that is what makes it more fun. Though Happy ara aren&#039;t the only ones within the show. There is the members of Photon Maiden and Peaky P that we get to know as the series goes on.  One that was pretty much the top group of the school, while the other is a more company backed group.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, I should go into more detail about them. Rinku is a lovable bit air head like girl, who is just all loving for music and such. Maho is loving for music too, but she&#039;s a little more serious then Rinku, not too serious, but both are very passionate about music. Mumi is Rinku&#039;s childhood friend, and while she can come off as closed off, she is sweet in her own way, and does treat her friendship very seriously. Finally we have Rei, the more richer girl of the group, there are certain things that she isn&#039;t accustomed too, but she isn&#039;t a snob. She&#039;s willing to try things, a happy and open book, sometimes a little shy, but that just makes her oh so cute!! But that&#039;s just the tip of the characters, there are so many more that have a range of personalities that are just well shown and well done. Good stuff here.<br />
<br />
A major highlight and showcase of this show is of course the music. Honestly, you&#039;d find yourself going on Yt, rewatching some episodes in case you can&#039;t find the music elsewhere, but you&#039;ll be sure to enjoy the songs over, and over, and over again. They really smashed it out the park with them. Think of it a mix of DJing, but also idol like singing, it&#039;s a great mesh, that is just really good. Just look at the OP for instance. It really is that good, you can&#039;t go wrong there.<br />
<br />
The art is of course colourful, and the character&#039;s looks in general don&#039;t put you off at all, but the overall colours are bright, flashy, and so welcoming. Hell a lot of the time, you feel like you&#039;re at a major concert, having the time of your life, and it&#039;s really reflected within the style of the show. It&#039;s great.<br />
<br />
DJD4 came late, but it certainly left it&#039;s mark for all the right reasons. Watch it if you haven&#039;t, and listen to all the amazing tracks afterwards!

    This anime is proof that 3d animations are great as well. It&#039;s the anime you would watch to learn things you didn&#039;t know about being a DJ, kind of like Danberu, an anime where it teaches you how to exercise and how to use gym equipments, or Dr. Stone, an anime that teaches you about chemistry.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10: Not really new, I have seen plots like this one before, but this doesn&#039;t make it a bad plot, it just shows a lack of originality.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: Very good, the design of the characters are stunning and the things that our protagonists use as well. Although, I couldn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364821">
        rate it over an 8 because the quality difference between the background characters and main characters are too great. The extras, in all honesty, look like models you&#039;d see in a game while running it at the lowest, potato quality, graphics settings.<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10: It&#039;s good, but I wouldn&#039;t listen to any of the tracks the whole day because it&#039;s a little loud for my taste.<br />
<br />
Character 6/10: Decent development and likable characters.<br />
<br />
Enjorment 7/10: Pretty entertaining and got hooked to it after the first episode.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10: Though this show can be boring because it does feel a little slow sometimes, it&#039;s good and I recommend it.

    Do you know Game Dev Tycoon? Imagine if you put the slider for &quot;sound&quot; all the way up, spending 90% of the budget on music. That is what this anime feels like in the beginning.<br />
The story is... okay I guess. The background of the main characters is a bit tacky, yet understandable.<br />
The art shows that CGI can be good. Someone critisised clash of artstyles, but I think it suits the anime relatively well (exept that one scene when MC has visibly different eyes from the rest of her class - the MCs don&#039;t blend in very well)<br />
The music is just perfect. You can really see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368928">
        that when they are doing an anime about DJing they mean it. The music is just built to be enjoyed.<br />
The characters are likeable, and also have their own weak side. Each one has one distinct personality, but sometimes the anime tries to stick to that personality too much and it makes some scenes cringy<br />
Overall, a very enjoyable show, especially to laugh at the amount of english words botched by VAs (I don&#039;t blame them, I just find it funny). This anime is about music, and it has good music.

    I usually tend to not write reviews, because I find it a waste of time. Time that&#039;s finite in this life, so I&#039;d rather waste it doing something else. Usually, I find one or two reviews that reflect or are close to my opinion on a series, so I up-vote it and move on. But with this series, there is not a single review below a 7 seriously mates...<br />
<br />
The series is over, but I&#039;ll try my best not to spoil it too hard, I still advise you to watch it first. Henceforth you&#039;re reading at your own peril. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! <br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382413">
        start with the visual aspect first. Typical SANZIGEN it&#039;s 3D, which I have mixed fillings about (the 3D that is). Usually, the visual quality isn&#039;t something I care for. I&#039;m of the belief that a good premise, well written characters, or a strong story direction are more important than visual quality. Of course, there are times that the visuals are a part of the viewing experience and in those cases, it should be taken into consideration. The backgrounds are pretty drab, with heavy digital compositing, but this is a SoL so drab comes with the territory nowadays. The character designs I&#039;m not a fan of, they feel robotic almost mannequinlike, with their plastic movement when dancing. That causes me to cringe pretty hard at times. Might I mention the screen shake during performances too? <br />
<br />
Okay let&#039;s talk about the sound, as this is a music-based series, this is an important aspect. Let&#039;s start with the BGM (outside of performances), nothing remarkable, typical for SoL &#039;elevator music&#039;. On to the voice talent (VA, Seiyuu whatever you want to call them), VAs outside of the music performances are okay, they fit the characters fine, though it&#039;s important to note that I don&#039;t care about VAs at all. I accept that baseline voice acting is at least at a 6/10 almost always and is notable only when the character is synonymous with the voice performance. I talked a lot about other stuff but you are probably wondering how are the musical performances. Well, that all depends on your taste and preferences in music. At the time of writing, I&#039;ve seen a bit over half of the series, the songs so far consist of some heavy auto-tune, electro-dance, techno, and dubstep. I don&#039;t like any sort of club style music, meaning I didn&#039;t really enjoy the musical performances. Fun fact Maho Akashi&#039;s VA Karin Kagami plays in the dub as well... for a jap it&#039;s okay I guess, though if I were to judge her in terms of dub performance it&#039;s quite terrible.     <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll discuss the story and characters together because there really isn&#039;t much to talk about. There isn&#039;t any story here, it just has a basic setting, and that is fine in a SoL series such as this. But in that case, one would be led to believe that the characters are good. What do I mean by good you may ask? Well written, well-realized, have fun personalities, have chemistry. Any of this in some sort of combo is what I would like to see, after all, SoL lives and dies by its characters. The characters here surmount to nothing but a paper-thin sack of tropes. They lack backstories, personalities, quirks... We have loud and hyper, cool and mature, shy and narcissistic, rich and stoic. That&#039;s all, feels like they took quite a bit of inspiration from K-On. There is very little drama, no conflict, no challenges to be overcome. Everything is always hunky-dory and smooth, by the end of an episode. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, by now I&#039;ve justified my opinion to you, and maybe you might see my side of things. My intentions are only to tell others of a similar mindset to not waste their time here. This is an unoriginal anime, with uninteresting cardboard cutouts, stiff 3D dancing, and bad music. Though I&#039;ll admit I&#039;m biased. I love SoL quite a bit and this series fell off a cliff for me. The pace is quite fast which is counterintuitive of SoL. And with that I leave you with a; thank you. Cheers! <br />

    Throughout the entirety of my watch of D4DJ, I was pleasantly surprised. For a show that seemingly went under the radar, there was quite a lot to enjoy about it from the enticing music to its well balanced cast of characters.<br />
<br />
D4DJ has a fairly simple story being primarily focused on a group of girls coming together to perform in front of live audiences as a DJ group. Rival groups appear and a drive to reach the top becomes a common thread. It&#039;s pretty common for shows like these to fall short on being able to make us care about each individual character. Generally, there always

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410513">
        ends up being a few that get the short end of the stick becoming nothing more than background characters, roles reduced to having minor gimmicks. But this show doesn’t do that. Each character is portrayed in a way where they have more going on with them than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
Each of the 4 main girls (Rinku, Maho, Muni, and Rei) share a special dynamic. Despite having only just met each other, they are more than just a group of strangers coming together to perform music. Throughout the course of the show, they become a close group of friends propelling one another and growing together to achieve a common goal -  to be the best DJ team at their school. And this growth they undergo is gradual but it is felt with each interaction and every scene they spend with each other. No one person gets all the spotlight in their group but rather they all share it contributing in their own unique way. Even the rival groups Photon Maiden and Peaky P-Key have time to shine with their characters as we get to know them as well with all their quirks.<br />
<br />
Rinku is a bubbly protagonist who spreads positivity to everyone and bettering them. Her role in the story could best be described as the anchor of the group as she not only gets the plot rolling but brings everyone together with her upbeat personality and energy. She tries to see the good in people and won’t bring anyone else down. Muni is perhaps the most fleshed out of the bunch. She seemingly is more of a stubborn self centered type of person who likes seeking recognition. Despite this side of her, she actually comes to care quite a lot about her friends and it’s shown in her subtle expressions and movement. Rather than being annoyingly over the top in her self indulgence and stubbornness, she comes off as endearing. Each of the other girls are all nuanced in their own ways with their share of flaws and setbacks.<br />
<br />
One thing the show does well is being able to tackle each of their issues and solving them in ways that don&#039;t resorting to unnecessary drama. In fact, there is no real drama in the show at all which is part of what makes it a joy to watch. There are no jarring tone shifts or annoying out of character moments. And despite there being a competitive nature to the show, it doesn’t take itself too seriously. This helps in terms of how the show handles interactions and comedy which are only amplified by the characters’ excellent chemistry with one another. Each of them just goes with the flow in every comedy segment. Although certain comedic moments occur throughout the show that result in overly long pauses and moments of complete silence. It is a minor gripe that happens a few times where I felt punchlines could have happened a bit sooner for more impact instead of dragging out.<br />
<br />
The biggest judgment and turn off when it comes to a show like this are its visuals which are in CG. To be fair, I personally did not find it to be too distracting in a negative way. Sure it’s no Beastars or Houseki no Kuni, but it’s far better than something like Berserk 2016 or Ex-Arm. It’s more so in a similar vein to Bang Dream with its later seasons. The visuals and aesthetic work quite well with one another in terms of facial expressions and character movement and become especially good during the performances which are mostly vibrant with bright and flamboyant colors.<br />
<br />
If there’s one thing this show excels at, it’s with the music. They don’t play the type of songs idol anime play. They play songs for DJs meaning fast, hard beats and techno/dubstep music. And I must say, it is fantastic. If you like this type of music, you will absolutely love the performances in this show. Did I forget to mention there’s rap music? There is a full episode where the characters have a rap battle with each other and it’s great.The soundtrack is pretty nice in this show along with a fine OP and ED to fit the energetic vibe.<br />
<br />
D4DJ is consistently well paced with a concise plot. The characters feel lively and endearing with their interactions being genuine and meaningful. The show itself is lighthearted and fun but also has that competitive edge to it to make things interesting. And by the end, the journey feels rewarding and perhaps even a bit emotional as we see how far their efforts get them. There is a feeling that the characters will continue to improve and reflect on their progress.<br />
<br />
Though simple in nature, D4DJ manages to craft a solid and engaging narrative along with a fond group of characters. I found this to be refreshing since this is rarely seen from most cute girl shows. They’re all likable enough that I would be more than looking forward to another season if there was one. I believe this anime is well worth giving a chance to if you have even an inkling of interest in music anime or a fun slice of life.

    D4DJ: First Mix proves that you don&#039;t need to save your school or become top idols to be a intriguing and interesting story. All you need is a couple of genuine characters with some original ideas backing up with great music.<br />
<br />
In a world where remixes rule the music industry, DJ and music producers are put in very high regard. In a DJ-specific high-school, our lovely and energetic Aimoto Rinku just tranfered in after spending many years in Africa. Immediately falling in love with a remix during lunch break, she rushes to the sound room and meets a young DJ followed by the name Maho. There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401850">
        their journey into the exciting world of modern music begins. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like CGI in anime and not really fond of remixes. But surprisingly, I absolutely love D4DJ. Their music presents many different tones and all pleasant to hear. The CGI is twice the quality Netflix is putting out constantly. They feel natural and the movement is very fluid. The design is a bit rip-off (You can see straight Nico-nico nii) but overall they did a great job. <br />
<br />
The most important thing is they focus the show to be the most entertaining experience as possible. No unnecessary drama to deepen the mood, not focusing too much on competition, just having fun day after days. And yes, they do have some dramas but that&#039;s everyday life quarrels that bring out characters developments and help the viewers to relate to them more. In the end, they became genuine characters.<br />
<br />
Overall, 9/10 very solid show. Wish they do another season for D4DJ, I want to see them more. Hearing them singing purifies my soul.

    Do you like idols?<br />
Do you like Wubs?<br />
<br />
If like me you answered yes to both then congratulations you&#039;ve found your next favourite.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie as far as the story goes its a pretty standard Idol fare, if you&#039;ve seen an idol show before the general beats of getting the gang together etc are familiar to you, but at least they aren&#039;t dragged out like some idol shows have recently, gangs together in the first few episodes and we&#039;re into the meat of the story fairly quick. <br />
<br />
The fact it&#039;s effectively an idol tournament arc also mitigates these issues as rather than campaigning to beat the one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376538">
        big event a la the likes of Love Live, we&#039;ve already had the team up against multiple opponents, with more promised in future media.<br />
<br />
Despite what it lacks in the story, it does what it repeats well and the music and design are just so good I couldn&#039;t help but watch every episode as soon as I could and even have several of the songs on my daily playlist.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t like DJ music or idols this probably won&#039;t be your thing, but hey if that was the case you probably wouldn&#039;t be here anyway!

    Being a veteran DJ myself as well as a long time Anime fan, I just had to give this series a watch out of sheer curiosity as it combines 2 of my biggest hobbies. To my surprise this series absolutely exceeded all expectations I had for it to the point I&#039;d consider it the biggest sleeper of the Fall 2020 season. To be honest, Episode 1 airing during Week 5 or 6 (don&#039;t quote me on this) didn&#039;t exactly do it any favors.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
The story is fairly simple. It starts off with Rinku, our MC and big music fan, attending a new school called Yoba

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373654">
        Academy which is apparently a pretty prestigious music academy. There she meets Maho, who introduces her to one of the school&#039;s specialties, DJing, which Rinku immediately falls in love with. Almost immediately they decide to form a new DJ group and recruit fellow students Muni &amp; Rei and perform to become one of the top DJ groups in the school. In their way are Peaky P-Key, the hard working senpais everyone looks up to, and Photon Maiden, a new super group formed by a big time corporation. While they don&#039;t attempt to break from conventional story writing structure the series does what it does at a fairly solid level, however there are a couple episodes that exceed that like in Episode 7 that realistically follows Maho&#039;s impressive display of mental gymnastics after mishearing Rinku&#039;s conversation with the leader of Peaky P-Key leading her to overthink Rinku is leaving to join the other group.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
Perhaps the biggest aspect of the show that exceeded my expectations was the art style. The use of 3DCG was a big gamble as it can be a massive hit, or a massive miss, with rarely anything in between. In this case I would consider it a hit, and even put it up in the same grouping as Land of the Lustrous and Beastars, although in a more Moe styling. What blew me away was how they used this format to make the characters expressions and movements stand out, in a way i don&#039;t think could have been replicated in a hand drawn style without being overly ridiculous. Perhaps the only one thing i didn&#039;t like about the art style is their over usage of &lt;Insert Generic CG Extra&gt; in a lot of shots, specifically the performances. This gave the otherwise strong performance scenes a rather bitter taste whenever it would pan to the crowds. <br />
<br />
*As an interesting aside they decided to animate the workers in the Café where they hold their team meetings in a very clean, traditional hand drawn art style. The reason for this, I have no clue.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Being a DJ myself this is the aspect where I was coming into watching the series expecting to be the most critical, but as soon as I saw and heard the OP it put my concerns almost immediately to rest. The OP is catchy and features a solid mix of Idol Pop with a lot of EDM techniques and influences, and sets the tone for the rest of the series. However the biggest part that impressed me was how distinct in style they decided to make the music for each group; Happy Around!&#039;s music is as expected the same upbeat blend of Idol-Pop and EDM you hear in the OP, Peaky P-Key&#039;s music is a high BPM blend of Eurodance, Hip Hop and J-Pop, and Photon Maiden has a perfectly suited ethereal blend of Trance, Progressive and Electro. There is another group, Merm4id, which has yet to be introduced that has an even stronger EDM presence of Big Room, Electro and Progressive. <br />
<br />
Characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
Right off the bat you are introduced to Rinku&#039;s extremely outgoing and bubbly personality which thankfully just sits on the line between engaging and annoying. Maho perfectly balances out Rinku&#039;s high energy with a more serious, think-first-act-second personality to the point where she has a bad habit of over thinking her productions and relationships with the crew. Muni, the VJ and Designer of the group, is both pretty loud in dress and attitude but is pushing herself to improve her relationships with other thanks to Rinku. Rei is a shy, reserved, music geek that comes from a strict family but wants to spread her wings despite knowing her family would likely disapprove. Impressively, the side characters from Peaky P-Key and Photon Maiden are almost as fleshed out as Happy Around! and almost each of them get their chance to have character development of their own which is a sign of strong character writers.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
While D4DJ: First Mix is definitely part of the Idol/Music genre that isn&#039;t as popular out West, if you are in any way a fan of Pop or EDM music this is definitely something easy to watch and get in to. I&#039;m not the biggest Idol/Music fan myself but I gave the show a chance and I do not regret a second of it. Do not let the 3DCG art style discourage you watching this series either. Impressively there really isn&#039;t really anything negative to say about this series.<br />
<br />
Just give it a shot and enjoy!

    Everytime I finished the episode, nothing heals my heart with good old Maho-chan&#039;s T-pose. This makes me want to go on further in life and thanks to that, I am now a true T-pose believer. Lets talk about T-pose, to re-create the perfect Maho-chan T-pose, you must get into the zone. Raise your hands into a horizontal position, and feel the wind flow flowing through your arms, think of the hardwork you did while playing with the music mixer and the happy times while watching D4DJ. Always remember, nothing completes an episode of D4DJ without Maho-chan&#039;s T-pose in the end.

    Are you tired of watching only dark and dreary anime? Do you like cute girls and good music? Do you want to see an anime that&#039;s fully CGI that actually looks good? Well look no further because D4DJ First Mix is the show for you!<br />
<br />
Allow me to give some background on this show: D4DJ is a new multimedia project created by Bushiroad, the same studio that brought us Bang Dream, Project Sekai and Revue Starlight. Bushiroad&#039;s founder Takaaki Kidani got the idea for D4DJ when he watched a group known as the Chainsmokers perform at at the 2017 Singapore Grand Prix. Kidani claims that the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395354">
        point of D4DJ is that he wanted music that could connect people of different races, genders and generations together, much like how he saw everyone at that concert super excited to watch a group from America perform.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s enough on the background of the show, so let&#039;s move onto to the show itself. The anime centers itself on a girl named Rinku Aimoto who prior to the anime&#039;s start lived in Africa for most of her life only to then move back to Japan in High School. She then stumbles upon a performance by the most popular unit from her new school, P-Pkey and gets inspired to start a DJ unit herself. She then ropes a DJ at her school, Maho Akashi into joining her group and they begin to perform together. Maho teaches Rinku how DJing works since Rinku hadn&#039;t even heard of DJs until returning to Japan. Rinku is the audience&#039;s window into how this stuff works and we learn about how to be a DJ through her eyes. Later on in the show Rinku also gets her childhood friend Muni Oonaruto and a pianist named Rei Togetsu to join her group as well and they name themselves Happy Around after a catchphrase Rinku says whenever she gets happy.<br />
<br />
The story is what you&#039;d expect from an idol anime, with the girls shooting to become popular enough to make it to the sunset stage, a stage that only the most popular DJ groups from the school get to perform on. The characters are pretty simple, but due to all of them having very unique personalities and stories all of them are easily distinguishable. Maho in comparison to Rinku is more level headed and realistic about her dreams and desires. Much like Misaki from Bang Dream, she&#039;s the normal one of her group and provides for some levativity among the group&#039;s antics. Muni on the other hand is way more outspoken and prideful of herself and craves recognition for her skills as the group&#039;s VJ artist. She and Rinku were childhood friends and as such Muni has some resentment towards Rinku for forgetting to write to her once she moved away but still wants to become closer to her former friend. Rei is a very quiet girl who plays the piano. Due to having a rich family that more or less shelters her, she hasn&#039;t really had any chances to make choices for herself but through the group change starts to brew within her. The characters from the other two groups in the anime, Peaky P-key and Photon Maiden are both enjoyable as well so I&#039;ll talk about some of them. Kyoko is the stylish and determined leader of Peaky P-Key who finds herself very interested in Happy Around&#039;s performances. Despite being Rinku&#039;s rival so to speak, she&#039;s not really rude to her at all and instead invites Rinku to one of her group&#039;s performances. Shinobu, Peaky P-key&#039;s DJ, is a lot more competitive and serious than Kyoko as a result of her having worked in DJ field ever since she was young. She wins every one of her school&#039;s remix contest without fail and all she has to say for it is that everyone else just sucks compares to her. Saki is the soft spoken DJ of Photon Maiden, a DJ group that was chosen through auditions by a top notch label company. She has synesthesia which allows her to see colors in her music who is looking for a new color for her group.<br />
<br />
Another one of this show&#039;s main draws is the music, it&#039;s very good. All three of the groups have very different styles and cover a different genre of music. Happy Around&#039;s music is for the most part very upbeat, fast paced and cheerful. No matter what track from them you play, you&#039;re more than bound to smile upon hearing their music. All of the girls sing in the songs, with Muni and Rinku&#039;s high pitched voices complementing the fast nature of their music perfectly. Maho&#039;s voice in comparison is a lot more normal sounding and Rei&#039;s voice is really deep compared to everyone else in her group, but it&#039;s gorgeous enough to not be too distracting. Peaky P-Key&#039;s music has a more techno hip hop vibe to it. Unlike Happy Around, Kyoko does most if not all the singing for the unit and her voice is neither to deep nor to high pitched yet has a certain power to it that makes every song she does feel crisp. If you like Bang Dream you&#039;ll probably recognize her voice actress Aimi as the same person who voiced the main heroine of that franchise Kasumi Toyama, which makes the scene were she tells Rinku it&#039;s her turn to shine feel all that more impactful. Photon Maiden has a soft techno dance vibe to it that is for the most part has a bit of a softer sound compared to how loud most of Happy Around and Peaky P-Key&#039;s songs are. Every voice actress from the group has had experience working with Bushi before with Saki and Ibuki being voiced by Chu2 and Aya from Bang Dream and Towa and Noa being voiced by Mahiru and Junna from Revue Starlight. Then there&#039;s Wow World Tonight which is performed by the Raychell (Layer from Bang Dream) and the legendary Nana Mizuki. Wow World Tonight connects all four of the members as all four of them were there at the last concert it was performed at before it&#039;s group broke up as well as being the song that allowed Rinku to meet Maho. Throughout the show neither one of the two original singers just vanishes though with Raychell&#039;s character being Photon Maiden&#039;s producer and Mizuki&#039;s character working at the cafe were Happy Around meets. The ending sequence is joyous with Maho dancing to the song as she works with her DJ discs and the OP, while more upbeat is also a joy to watch. It&#039;s performed by the members of Happy Around and throughout the song they dance around and sing. Kyoko and Saki also have a small part in the opening where both of them sing as well as the names of their groups flash behind them.<br />
<br />
Now onto the CGI animation. CGI has become a bit of a dark horse in the anime community due to shows like Ex-Arm and Berserk 2016. So how is the CGI animation in this show? I&#039;ll be 100% honest here, it looks fantastic. The CGI allows for the characters to have some really unique facial expressions and movements as well as some really great character acting. There&#039;s this one scene were Rinku is eating her troubles away that looks incredible due to the amount of facial expressions and fluid movements throughout the sequence. The dance sequences are also beautifully animated with every character looking incredibly expressive and the movements being very crisp and sharp. There are sometimes when the 2D models clash a bit with the 3D ones but that only happens in a few moments and it&#039;s not distracting enough to take away from the rest of the show. I wouldn&#039;t put it on the same level as Houseki no Kuni in terms of animation, but it&#039;s still fantastically done and makes the show a joy to watch. SANZIGEN is the studio behind the show and they worked on season two and season three of Bang Dream as well as the franchise&#039;s MVs, movies as well as the anime for its spinoff Argonavis from Bang Dream. Another thing worth noting interestingly enough is that they also did the cutscenes for the video game Fire Emblem Three Houses, which is one of the most popular games on the Nintendo Switch and when comparing D4DJ to something like Three Houses it&#039;s very clear that they&#039;ve improved a lot over the years with their CGI animation.<br />
<br />
All in all while not perfect D4DJ is one of the most enjoyable shows I&#039;ve come across last year. It&#039;s available for free on Youtube both subbed and dubbed with the dub being one of the best I&#039;ve heard in ages with Rinku, Rei and Muni being perfectly cast with Rinku and Rei&#039;s vas being some of the best rising stars in the dubbing world and Muni&#039;s va being a popular streamer who actually has a lot in common with her character. As for Maho, her Japanese voice actress Kagami Karin reprises her role for the show&#039;s dub due to being fluent in English and while the accent does seem a bit weird at first it adds a layer of authenticity to the show&#039;s dub. Kyoko, Shinobu and Saki all have relatively new vas as well with Shinobu&#039;s va being completely new with no credits to speak of before this but they all do a fantastic job as well. The show is free on Youtube since Bushiroad wants as many people as possible to watch it so please do so. I highly recommend this show, it&#039;s such a great time with some great music to boot. I cannot wait for the global version of the app on May 27th and a potential season two so we can meet the three other groups Rondo, Merm4id and Lyrical Lily.

    As a long time fan of Bushiroad&#039;s various idol projects, I was very excited to start D4DJ. I fell in love with it the very first episode and immediately got my girlfriend on board with me. We&#039;ve been keeping up with it every single week, absolutely enthralled with these characters. <br />
<br />
I love the music most of the groups have; I&#039;ve been listening to the singles non stop since I found out about this series. Very excited for the English server of the game coming out also! But the music isn&#039;t the only thing that does it for this show. Of course, being a music and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377255">
        idol genre series, it does perform in that regard as well. But, the key factor here is absolutely the fun and colorful cast of characters that we have running around. <br />
<br />
Photon Maiden and Peaky P-Key are so fun and interesting, and I hope we get a second season to explore them and the other bands as well. But Happy Around! stole our hearts. These four girls have such strong chemistry as a group and as characters, just sitting there and watching them talk was so entertaining and has been the highlight of our week. The expression work and modeling of the show are great and make for such a fun style. <br />
<br />
I do have to say that it was rather jarring every time they switched between the main 3D models of the star cast/unit members, the 3D models of the other background students, and the 2D style of the more relevant side characters. I hope if we do get a second season that they improve on this, since that is my one critique of the show. <br />
<br />
All in all I had such a good experience, just as I did with the first 2 seasons of Love Live and the Bandori series. Looking forward to more D4DJ!

    D4DJ: First Mix is a really good anime that I have watched! The storyline, characters, music, and other stuff; it&#039;s just, good! I really like how the story had a mix of emotions that I, obviously, got happy (because of Rinku, the main character in the anime, who gave me, as well as the viewers, the happy and energetic vibe)! As someone who likes these kind of anime (the one with the Music genre, similar to BanG Dream!), I really enjoyed watching this. I vibed to the music as well, especially on the parts containing live performances.<br />
<br />
I personally got attached to Happy Around&#039;s story all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377060">
        throughout the whole anime. It showed how HapiAra got formed as a DJing unit, and them slowly improving on each episode. The side characters, particularly the ones in Peaky P-Key and Photon Maiden, gave the anime some extra spark (a spark that adds up to the spark Rinku and the others are giving). Even the cameo characters as well, they also gave life to the whole thing. Personally, I really like the insert songs here as well, and it&#039;s really boppin&#039;!<br />
<br />
The character development in the anime is also nice. Especially with the two childhood friends here, Rinku and Muni. They did the best character development during the anime in my opinion. The other characters did the same as well, including the side characters. Each of their personalities may be different, but personally I relate to their stories as well. I will also include the other side characters as well, since they are given life as well. What I mean by that is, in my personal experience of watching anime, some characters are, well, just there. They are just simply elements of the anime. But here in D4DJ, there are extra characters that not only is treated as a simple element, but also as part of the story.<br />
<br />
I will also include the fact that the characters are voiced really well! Character voicing in anime is really an important thing to give an anime series life. The voices behind the characters are really nice, since it describes their characteristics and personalities. And I just mentioned that voicing an anime character can give him/her life, and this gave a lot of life (emphasis on that).<br />

Again, I really enjoyed this anime, that&#039;s why I gave it a perfect score on all aspects (story, art, etc.) Simply put, it&#039;s an amazing anime to watch. It&#039;s also enjoyable because of the story, and you can feel a lot of emotions by just feeling the whole thing by heart. I got satisfied by this anime so much that I want to rewatch it, just like what I did on all seasons of BanG Dream! To all of the team behind D4DJ: First Mix, the staff and voice actors, you really did a great job on producing this anime! Kudos to all of you!

    I first got into D4DJ not expecting much, but after the first three episodes, I was really excited for the next one. What the basic premise lacks- ‘Newbie forms a DJ group and tries to become the best in the school’- the sheer energy of the characters, music and scenes make up for. I always enjoyed seeing the characters interact, and I think their personalities are all shown well, without saying straight to your face what they are. The music was super good and I always looked forward to the next performance, and the animation is REALLY good. REALLY really good. The 3D models give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386876">
        the characters this smooth look during the performances that 2D animation just wouldn’t emulate well, and the 3D doesn’t feel out of place at all. My main complaint is that some of the 2D background characters don’t mix with the 3D ones well, especially when they’re in the same scene. I still have no idea why the two cafe staff are 2D- they’re in almost every episode, and they interact with the main characters a lot.<br />
I also realised after finishing the anime that we barely get to know half of Photon Maiden, the third DJ unit we’re introduced to. We know Noa and Ibuki’s basic personalities, but compared to how much we see Saki and even a bit of Towa, they feel like background characters. I wish we got to see a little more of them by themselves, especially Noa.<br />
Overall, D4DJ was unexpected, but a blast. The interactions were fun, the music and performances were fun, everything felt fun. I never found myself hating a particular character, and the songs I disliked at first, I quickly grew to like. Watch it on YouTube, it’s free!

    When I first watched BanG Dream, I found myself extremely confused and frankly very repulsed from the spunky nature of the main characters and how by simply being too sticky, Kasumi can somehow pull together an entire band. Admittedly when I started D4DJ I felt that Rinku embodies many of the similar traits Kasumi showed, however, the overall flow of the anime felt a lot smoother compared to Bandori, and I ended up finding myself even more immersed in it than I thought I would.<br />
D4DJ is a bit of an enigma in terms of what exactly it is. It&#039;s not strictly a DJ group, since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411496">
        all they do is just mix and transition music. It&#039;s not a band either, since not all of their members play instruments. Nor are they an idol group since their songs aren&#039;t pre-made and rather mixed live. It&#039;s sorta a bit of everything, an Idol Group that mixes and performs its songs live on stage, and by doing so it seamlessly blends all 3 genres and aspects of music into one seamless transition. It&#039;s very refreshing to experience and definitely innovative, and when backed with the right characters and progression of events, the entire anime feels alive and vibrant.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story of D4DJ is honestly the weakest part about it, and yet even if you&#039;re seeing the classic niche events that every Idol/Band anime includes, it doesn&#039;t feel as niche as the others. The story follows your classic hotheaded girl who&#039;s charisma attracts together a group of people as they attempt to win a title in the local esteemed competition. Along the way the group bonds with a sleepover, some minor conflict happens with at least one member of the group, a study session is held because the spunky ones are always in danger of failing finals, and they persevere with the power of friendship. It&#039;s the bread and butter formula of all of these idol groups and this formula has been done to no end. While D4DJ is prone this repetitive formula, the redeeming aspect is not in the main group Happy Around, but rather in its rival groups Peaky P-key and Photon Maiden. The best example I can come up with is sorta like A-Rise in Love Live, a well-established group that serves as formidable rivals to the main group µ&#039;s. In D4DJ the extremely well-established and popular group exists in Peaky, but D4DJ also has a ground-up rival in Photon Maiden. This creates a more rough interaction between the groups that leads to them creating a seamless bond that can clearly be seen throughout the anime, one that Love Live&#039;s A-Rise failed to create.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
D4DJ is one of the few animes to feature CG 3D characters. While they&#039;re not the only ones (Argonavis from BanG Dream also uses it), they went way past 11 on it. While their character are basically 3D models, D4DJ still incorporates a lot of cartoony aspects that you normally wouldn&#039;t expect. Rinku&#039;s reactions are always comically hilarious because they would go nuts with the effects, replacing her eyes with the classic &quot;&gt;.&lt;&quot; face or maybe replacing her eyes with straight up fire emojis when she&#039;s fired up. It creates a wonderful comical aspect that you wouldn&#039;t otherwise find in animes, especially not animes with 3D CG.<br />
<br />
Music<br />
As a music anime, D4DJ&#039;s heaviest selling point is in its music, naturally, each group and episode features unique tracks that illustrate the DJ style. The OP itself familiarizes viewers to the concept of DJs, as its comprised of 3 entirely different songs seamlessly blended together in a true DJ fashion. Each group also has its own unique style. Photon Maiden&#039;s songs give off a galactic vibe while adhering to their &quot;cool and stylish&quot; mentality. Peaky P-key&#039;s songs are powerful and the mixes feel well-made. Happy Around&#039;s songs are vibrant and give off a scattered feeling. Apart from that, you can physically hear the aspects each group is gunning for and use the music alone to pre-determine the winner before it is even announced. In the versus round between Photon and Happy, you can tell which song had the most impact on the audience, and in the final showdown the minute you hear the songs it becomes clear what will happen.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Last but not least, every one of these DJ units has to be supported by a powerful team. The story follows our main 4: Rinku, Maho, Muni, and Rei. The 4 of them create a very distinct and contrasting dynamic that not gonna lie, kinda reminds me of Doki Doki Literature Club. Rinku is the spunky and clearly overcaffeinated main vocalist, Rei is the bookish, quiet, yet talented composer; Muni is your Nico-style cutesy yet kinda egotistic Video Jockey/Arts person, and Maho is the rising star and respectable DJ. Their tropes have been done to no end, yet what sets these groups apart is the dynamic the anime gave to them. Rinku has an explanation for being overhyped because she literally is a monke brain, Maho actually puts herself to her limits to better herself instead of just sitting in front of a desk ruminating about some obscure strategy, Rei&#039;s rich upbringing makes her a bit distant but she wants to get to know the group better by actively taking the initiative and even leading some events, and Muni&#039;s childhood connection, as well as background support, prevent her from being a Nico Nico Nii joke. The other groups receive just as much attention as well. The dynamic established between these groups makes it so that all their characters, no matter how flat or how much of a cardboard cutout they are, appear in some degree to be rounded and well-developed. Photon Maiden is your classic Cars 3 designer-made tactically optimized group with songs that fit their dynamic selected by a professional record label, but their DJ, Saki, struggles with remixing and wants to create a track that has &quot;its own color&quot;. (The way they built Saki as a character makes me think she has Synthesia which is why she&#039;s so obsessive about the colors and that just makes that entire episode feel way better). Peaky is the frontrunner of the school, but the character dynamic that many members of its team shares with the main cast in Happy Around makes them feel not like cocky assholes but rather upperclassmen who want to introduce this group of clearly passionate girls the real life of living as a DJ group.<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed D4DJ far more than I did any other music-related anime. Their characters shone so much brighter, their dynamics were so much better, and they felt like genuine characters that build their music from the ground up instead of characters built around songs.
