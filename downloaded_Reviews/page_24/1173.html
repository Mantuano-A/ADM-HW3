    Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, by all accounts, should have been a completely forgettable and mediocre show having the pretense of being a teaser anime for Cygames and their mobile card game. The source material has the plot of a piece of cardboard and is little more than a collection of conceptual artwork. With all those things in mind, Studio MAPPA rises to the challenge and completely shatters my non-existent expectations as they set the standard for a promotional show.  <br />
<br />
Taking place within a fantasy setting where the combined efforts of mankind, gods and demons have successfully sealed away the world-destroying Bahamut, the world of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175019">
        Mistarcia enters into an era of peace. To insure that Bahamut would be forever encaged in its prison, the seal&#039;s key was split into two pieces and given to the gods and demons respectively. Two thousand years, a  women named Amira manages to steal the gods&#039; half of the key and that where the show chooses to kick off its epic adventure. Caught up in Amira&#039;s quest to reach the land of Helhelm are two bounty hunters with clashing sets of personalities and values. <br />
<br />
The plot is simple enough and easy to follow but Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis&#039;s strength lies in its brilliant execution and ever-escalating set pieces. Human, monsters, gods and demons of all different shapes and sizes come in for a battle royale that never fails to disappoint because the action is paced to be fast and furious which leaves little room for exposition. This actually works in the show&#039;s favor because it let the viewer&#039;s knowledge of other fantasy shows fill in the gaps instead of piling on explanations that would only get in the way. Fights takes place in varying degrees of captivating environments as the show overwhelm the viewers with its extravaganza displays.  It does fall victim to losing momentum towards the middle portion as a dreaded recap episode shows up and the political maneuvering is less interesting than the hordes of monsters and soldiers duking it out with each other. Fortunately enough, it does manage to pick itself up to throws everything and everyone into speculate of the grand finale.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Having nothing but character illustrations as their starting point, the production staff MAPPA have crafted some very lovable characters that are all distinct in their attributes and eccentric personalities. It&#039;s not all about the action as the main characters are given fleshed out <br />
backstorys and motivations rather than being  Amria is actually a very strong demonic melee fighter capable of tearing apart much larger monsters with ease but acts very much like a child in spite of her terrifying power and outward appearance. She is quite endearing and the focal point of which the show drives itself. <br />
<br />
Smitten by her looks and misguide notions, Kaisar Lidford is one the two bounty hunters accompanying Amria on her quest to reunite with her mother. A former knight that was disgraced, he still retains his code of honor in every fiber of his being and that extends to his fighting style, hair, and upkeep of his promises. He was overly the knight-in-shining-armor to a fault but I did warm up to him as the series went on as his character dynamics complement the other members of main cast.  <br />
<br />
This brings me to my two favorite characters of Favaro Leone and Rita. To start off, Favaro is nothing like your conventional hero as his goal in life is to loudly indulge in life&#039;s guilty pleasures of women, money and booze while. As a red-headed bounty hunter, he is selfish, crass and utterly underhanded when it comes to fighting while wielding a revolver crossbow. <br />
<br />
How awesome is that? <br />
<br />
Equally fabulous is Rita, who joins up with the main cast a little further down the story. She may look like loli bait but never adheres to the stereotypical template that her appearance suggested. Her character interactions and contributions made the show that much more enjoyable on top of what was already offered. <br />
<br />
There is a myriad of other supporting characters from all the different race who don&#039;t really get or need character development but make the most of their limited screentime in just being plain awesome. Some standouts include Jeanne D&#039;Arc of the humans, Bacchus, a god who manages the bounty system and Azazel of the demon faction. <br />
<br />
Visuals<br />
<br />
Animated by the Studio MAPPA, the very same team who created Kids on the Slope and Zankyou no Terror, the amount of quality put into this series places it among the best looking shows of the 2014 fall season. Drawing inspiration from Western fantasy aesthetics, the art style is atypical of the standard Japanese anime look and has that classic Dungeons and Dragons vibe to it. The attention to detail to the various locales and props really help immerse the audience into the world of  Rage of Bahamut: Genesis and that not even mentioning the stellar cinematography which lends itself to be more of a Hollywood film than standard anime show. There are small amounts of 3DCGI and for the most part, it looks all right as it doesn&#039;t distracts from the pretty 2D visuals.   <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Yoshihiro Ike, who scored the soundtrack to Ergo Proxy and Tiger and Bunny, comes in with a full orchestra and choir to deliver something that didn&#039;t really live up to the epic action on the screen. His work, by all means, was well-composed and of high quality but I couldn&#039;t help but feel that the music was rather uninspired  and lack the punch to bring the show to the next level. More specifically, it may be due to the lack of variety when it comes to just relying on strings and vocal as I found hard to recall anything memorable. Perhaps, if he had used more instruments in his ensemble, it would be an given the visuals the accompaniment and energy it deserves. In contrast, the opening credits, &quot;EXiSTENCE” performed by SiM, was one of my favorites of the fall season with it rock music and awkward Engrish. It does what every opening should do and that is to be extremely metal and awesome in priming the viewers for each weekly installment. <br />
<br />
Game Adaption<br />
<br />
If Studio MAPPA had the goal of making me try out whatever they were advertising for, <br />
<br />
they succeeded.   <br />
<br />
Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was amazing enough that I simply wanted more and what better way to do so than to download the game it&#039;s based off of. However, upon seeing the chunky dated interface, confusing bland gameplay and obvious microtransactions, I promptly deleted it off my machine. I&#039;m grateful that aspects of the trading card game were integrated quite well in the framework of the show of which was the bounty system and I never felt it was overbearing or obnoxious. It was just a small reminder of what the show&#039;s roots are and just how vastly difference they are in terms of quality.  <br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
<br />
Coming completely out of the left field, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis is the surprise hit of the 2014 fall season. I simply cannot give enough praise to Studio MAPPA for their creativity and talent in creating a show that defies all expectations. There were a few small things that held it back from being a masterpiece, but nevertheless it was still one hell of a ride. <br />
<br />
Final Score: 8.5/10<br />

    In depth review #2 - Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis<br />
<br />
Shingeki no Bahamut was exactly what i wanted it to be. An epic battle fantasy anime with good characters and a unique universe that blended everything together. And DRAGONS, beautifully animated hardcore FUCKING DRAGONS! Most shows with dragons in it makes their dragons look like shitty play-doh statues but this show did i right. All you need to do is see the first scene of the show and you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about. If there are any gamers reading this, imagine the game Darksiders mixed with the opening cinematic trailer of Final Fantasy XIV and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175231">
        is basically Shingeki no Bahamut in a nutshell, epic.<br />
<br />
Story: 8.25 (Very Good)<br />
The story revolves around Bahamut, an all-powerful dragon&#039;s rebirth into the world. When this dragon was alive, It&#039;s cataclysmic rampage nearly ended all life on the planet. This truth forced humans, angels, and demons to form a temporary trues to seal this dragon away forever. From the backlash of the battle, the god Zeus and Satan himself had to sacrifice themselves by sealing their spirits in two pendants to stop him. If the two keys where to merge again, then Bahamut will be reborn and fuck shit up again. The show start off with a girl how steels one of the keys from the angels and begins the process of Bahamut&#039;s inevitable resurrection. I personally thought the story was amazing. It wasn&#039;t super convoluted and was easy to understand. Yes, its kind of a genetic (seal to big bad dragon before we get rekted) story but the journey, and back-story behind the characters separated this one from the rest. <br />
<br />
Animation: 9 (Great)<br />
The animation was so clean i could of ate off of it. Nothing but stunning. The atmosphere and backgrounds are well flushed and polished. Details can be seen in the smallest of the things on the scene that most people wont even be looking at. In addition, things such as particle were shy of perfection. The sparks that flew of off swords as they clash, the radiant illuminations that where emitted from angles and demons eyes and bodies, the smoke and stones that flew threw through the air during a huge battle. All of these entities were beautifully animated. This is what initially got me watching the series in the first place. The production value for the animation was one of the best of 2014; up there with Fate/Stay Night and Nagino no Asukara. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8 (Very Good)<br />
The sound that played in the background of certain scenes set the tone of the sequence. They did a good job at doing this since some of the less notable scenes in the anime also made me feel a certain way. It wasn&#039;t what was going on, on the scene but was the music that complemented them them gave me the intended anticipation, or unease. For the epic fight scenes in the anime, all i could say it that the music was great. The heavy orchestrated tracks made the battle scenes even more epic then they already were. It&#039;s apparent that a lot of time and work went into developing this OST and i wanted to listen to the stand alone tracks but i couldn&#039;t find them. <br />
<br />
Characters: 7.5 (Good)<br />
I&#039;m happy to say that the creators didn&#039;t play a mindless game of (spin the wheel of generic character archetypes) when making theirs. Almost all of the character&#039;s personalities and designs felt new. The main characters were at there very peak when they interacted with each other (Favaro x Kaiser) (Favaro x Rita), however as stand alone characters they weren&#039;t as memorable as they could have been. The only exception this this would of had been Favaro. Speaking of, the main character Favaro the most unique person of the bunch. His mindset throughout the show generally stays the same but his own resolve and personality makes him like no other. Not only is his personality unique but his design is to. Favora is actually rocking an AFRO MULLET. I&#039;m not joking here, this is a thing now. For the other main characters, Kaiser is the epitome of a knight. We will do anything to keep his vows and restore honor to his families name. Amira is kind of simple minded but has a goal that she want to achieve. It seems that&#039;s all she wants to do; that and eat food. All of the other supporting characters is also well developed.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 (Great)<br />
I really enjoyed watching this anime. I binged through the entire thing in a day and wasn&#039;t dissatisfied. The beginning is a tab slow but shit gets real around episode 6 &amp; 7. If you pass this threshold, you wont be disappointed at all. It an anime that truly shocked me and i believe to be one of the better amines of 2014. If you like action animes, then this is a must watch because you will be blow away.<br />
<br />
Score: 8.35/10 (Good) - Must Watch<br />
<br />

    If the word ‘adventure’ is part of your daily vocabulary, then Shingeki no Bahamut is definitely something to consider watching. Based off a card game franchise, the series takes place in some sort of alternate medieval universe starring a group of young adventurers. The catch though is that the story is clouded by a dark past relating to a source of power threatening to destroy the world. That source (known as the Bahamut) was sealed away some 2000 years ago but has recently been broken and split into two in the form of keys. A cat and mouse-like game ensures now as to find the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175017">
        key and determine the fate of their universe.<br />
<br />
As intimidating as the title sounds, Shingeki no Bahamut is actually quite a fun show. And despite being based off a card game, there’s actually no Yugioh-style duels or Cardfight Vanguard battles. Instead, what we get is a fantasy adventure involving a trio of characters – Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Later on, another character named Rita joins them as well. But for starters, the show doesn’t start off with the three being together. In fact, it’s quite the opposite as we follow the life of bounty hunter Favaro. His encounter with Amira is like fate after he unconsciously makes a contract with her; and ends up growing a tail as a consequence.  On the other hand, there’s Kaisar with an almost exact opposite personality compared to Favaro. The show also introduces his purpose for becoming a bounty hunter and why he despises Favaro so much. So yeah, taking for granted, the two aren’t exactly the best of friends or at least anyways. Still, the most important character is perhaps Amira. She may seem like a normal girl with a big appetite but her ownership of a certain key could decide the outcome of their world’s future. This show explores a fantasy adventure quite different than what you may be used to. Rather than just going down a narrow-minded road of “saving the world”, we get a journey of old-fashioned and thrilling fun. I don’t mean fun as in the characters goofing around but fun as in spectacular feel which will keep your eyes glued to the screen.<br />
<br />
Adventure series can come as mixed bags for its variety at first. However, Shingeki no Bahamut creates a thrill of an adventure by bending with its natural settings. It’s able to keep its momentum every episode by introducing to the audience what it’s trying to do, the actor and actresses of each journey along with its purpose, and most importantly have fun with it wherever it goes. Indeed, the series’ setting is like a big playground with plenty to offer. From heavy guarded fortresses to the natural feelings of the sea, this series crafts fantasy in such a way that you may almost feel as if you are there. Not only that but the series offers plenty of creatures from its bestiary selection that includes dragons, zombies, and giant crabs. A more prominent species includes angels who seems to play a pivotal background role with connections to Amira. Because let’s face it, we barely know anything about the girl so anything to flesh out her character is a plus. Thankfully, the series doesn’t neglect any of our main characters and provides a detailed insight on some of their pasts including Kaisar and Favaro. It’s always nice to feel attached to some of the characters as well and even Amira can be amusing to watch thanks to her lack of common sense.<br />
<br />
Despite the fun feeling of the series, the story can be dark when it needs to be. A prime example consists of the struggle between Demons and Angels. After all, the series is all about finding the God’s Key, the important piece of puzzle used to unlock Bahamut. The series makes it clear through both words and scenarios that Bahamut is something like an Apocalypse. Should the source of power be unleashed would be the end of the world. With a good balance of story and character building, the show is able to focus on its plot very creatively. At the same time, I also find it fascinating how in the middle of all this, the show is still able to deal with interpersonal struggles. I’m referring to the conscious thoughts of Favaro and Kaisar when the two are forced into an alliance in order to survive and recuse Amira. The funny part of their adventures is that they usually argue between themselves in the face of danger. Yet somehow, they survive almost each time not by luck or skill but because of how they are able to cooperate even if it’s just momentarily. Because let’s face some facts: Favaro isn’t exactly a hero (he’s more like an anti-hero motivated by self-interests) while Kaisar tries to play the role of an avenger (take a good guess at who he is planning to kill). Of course, Amira also plays a role with her hidden secrets. Rita too plays a supportive role alongside Kaisar. These four characters makes the bulk of the fun in this series and no episode wastes time on their potentials.<br />
<br />
This show feels like a legend, something to remember by not just for the story or characters. And with legends, there are also myths and faces to remember. Perhaps a prominent character to also take notice is Jeanne D&#039;Arc. Staying true with her name and title, she is a warrior with a deadly lance. The show disregards any sort of feminine weakness in this woman but instead portrays her as someone who vows to save the world, a bold statement that could actually hold some truth with what she offers. Against all odds, she fights powerful demons such as Azazel and proves many times that she is capable of handling herself and perhaps even become a legend to remember. Similarly, Bahamut is also considered a legend with its back-story. The key difference is that its legend can be reborn and the show apparently also has a hidden villain; one who assumingly planned to allow Amira to obtain the God’s Key. The show has that notion of mystery to keep viewers at their seat.<br />
<br />
With all the fun going around the show, Shingeki no Bahamut can seem a bit ridiculous at times. Some of this can be the reoccurring jokes that can seem a bit repetitive. Furthermore, there are times on occasion when the balance of the series feels a bit off. Amira can also feel like a character that viewers will find difficulty to feel attached or even taken seriously at times; just look at the scenes when she is drunk or go full on gluttonous at the sight of delicious food. Finally, another drawback perhaps for this show is some episodes tends to be a bit rushed with resolution. One particular important episode has this predictable outcome with more potential but seemingly ends abruptly. Still, these things doesn’t ruin the series’ fun. In fact, you might be seduced into this story so much where those minor bits are seemingly forgotten.<br />
<br />
MAAPA isn’t exactly the most well-known studio but they should deserve recognition for this series’ artwork. Not only do characters look uniquely balanced but the setting itself is engrossed with fantastic elements. Speaking of characters though, Favaro has his signature afro-like hair that is hard to not take notice. Meanwhile, there’s the other supernatural entities that strikes fear and curiosity for viewers. Yet, the most impressive feature of the show truly shines during the action scenes. Marvelously crafted with strong coordination, I give high praise to the action scenarios each episode. Not only do they look good but feels real and hard to forget with its high production values. The show strives to build itself around a memorable adventure of full throttle action rather than asinine fan service. Thanks to what it has shown us, it did just that.<br />
<br />
While not as strong as the artwork, it’s also hard to forget the music of this series. A good example would be both the heavy metal OP song and the emotional ED. OST also makes sense on most parts with intense beats of its coordination. Luckily, all this balances well with the character voice mannerism as well. I give praise to Favaro’s VA for portraying him as a bounty hunter who always opens up paths of adventure thanks to his motivations. On the other hand, Kaisar’s voice can feel monotonous while Arima is down there somewhere in the middle. In retrospect, the soundtrack is above average but nothing too special that will knock you out of the park.<br />
<br />
Shingeki no Bahamut is an adventure theme series done right. With the way it does its info dumping, characterization, and storytelling, the series also made it like a wild roller-coaster ride. And during that ride, expect a lot of fantasy tropes that are all mixed in to celebrate the franchise. Some bits of the story could be lacking though and takes a bit of patience to get through. However, this definitely feels like an instant classic. Risky yet compelling, action packed as well as being able to articulate a story, the series proves over and over again why it can pull off its stunts. This is a must-see for any fan who wants to take a deep dive into adventure.<br />

    First, I have to say that this is one of the best anime I&#039;ve ever watched... It starts with the fact that it contains more than one mythological belief (Gods, Evil, Dragons, Legendary Heroes...) and further more they are fused in one story, when I read the synopsis, I thought that this is another anime with cliches about gods, humans, and evil fighting and shit, but then I was so glad I watched the first episode cause the characters were so good actually and since the beginning there was major events in the story.<br />
<br />
Second, the plot is good, I mean, combining stories already known and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182493">
        adding them to the main one is something not easy to do, but in this anime it&#039;s fluid and easy to understand even if you have no idea who the characters are in their real myth and if you do, well you will be amazed how the combination worked liked a charm.<br />
<br />
Finally, the sound (Ambiance) is well worked, simple with no overdone effects and clean, and when it come to the soundtrack, well it&#039;s the EPICNESS itself... really outstanding you can&#039;t get enough from it, very passionate, so powerfully emotional, so far this soundtrack is only second to elfen lied&#039;s...<br />
<br />
So yeah for me it&#039;s a 9/10 anime, I enjoyed watching it and it&#039;s worth the watch.

    &quot;Which way does the wind blow? To tomorrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shingeki no Bahamut is a pre-apocalyptic show about fate, destiny and what it means to change your fate, thrown into a cast of very unique characters and a power struggle between angels, humans and demons. The show is very promising from the beginning, builds up a lot of excitement in the middle, but ultimately ends in a rather anti-climactic fashion with insufficient resolution.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
Good points:<br />
+ Very unique character and setting designs<br />
+ Good and varied main and supporting cast<br />
+ Exciting and interesting from the beginning<br />
+ Good plot twist towards the end, though it may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178049">
        be obvious<br />
+ Some good comic moments<br />
<br />
Bad points:<br />
- Very underdeveloped antagonist characters<br />
- Fails to have a good resolution<br />
- Anti-climactic climax at the end of the anime<br />
- Many plot holes left unexplained<br />
- Lack of development in supporting characters<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to tackle this plot analysis in a slightly different manner and instead of focusing on key plot arcs, I&#039;m going to structure this on the various plot merits. The story itself is rather simple. Two bounty hunters and childhood friends, Favaro an Kaisar are at odds with each other. By chance or fate, Favaro meets Amira, a half-demon half-angel, who has just stolen the God Key and received instructions to go to Helheim. Favaro then promises to help Amira to bring her to Helheim but himself doesn&#039;t know a thing about where Helheim is or whether it actually exists.<br />
<br />
1. Ingenuity / Interest<br />
<br />
The story starts off with the main conflict right from the beginning. Constantly, we are being reminded that everything that the protagonists are trying to do, is to stop Bahamut&#039;s impending revival after the God Key was stolen. This same old story of imminent doom is repeated over and over again, as if the audience was too forgetful to remember how deadly Bahamut actually is. (+1 for overarching conflict)<br />
<br />
Bahamut was in fact, so deadly, that most of the cities managed to rebuild themselves sufficiently within the next 6 months, which is much shorter than it took Haiti to recover from the 2010 earthquake, and Sri Lanka to recover from the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. Clearly, Bahamut does less damage in 15 minutes than natural disasters can do in mere seconds. So, not that big of a deal actually.<br />
<br />
The anime did do a good job of attempting to fool the audience into thinking that Bahamut was very powerful though. There were numerous scenes throughout the anime, and in almost every episode, of the angels in heaven creating a barrier made up of tessellated hexagons, struggling to keep Bahamut&#039;s pre-awakening power in check. The angels constantly make remarks like, &quot;We can&#039;t keep this up... at this rate, we won&#039;t last...&quot; Archangel Michael even once says, &quot;If this is the power of Bahamut before he awakens, then how much more when he actually does?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old &quot;the world is coming to an end&quot; overarching conflict is not an original one unfortunately, so the story gets no points for that. Also, as far as plot is concerned, I was never really very excited about seeing Bahamut in action, neither was I very concerned about whether or not he would revive in the first place - because by half of the anime and due to all the constant reminders of Bahamut&#039;s terrifying power, it was obvious that he was going to revive anyway, and then get beaten by a random hero anyway.<br />
<br />
2. Depth / Development<br />
<br />
In this case, the story didn&#039;t offer much depth behind it at all. While Favaro&#039;s random musings about what his father said was interesting, all his talk about fate and changing your fate just sounded very cliched and fell on deaf ears. There was nothing remotely thematic about the rest of the story.<br />
<br />
Also, the story was so simple that they really stuck to the classic protagonist and antagonist stereotype. The main antagonist, Martinet, the ultimate manipulator&#039;s, real motives were basically to watch the world get destroyed, which is a very shallow explanation of his evil schemes. The protagonists on the other hand, simply want to do the opposite - prevent the world from getting destroyed, and nothing much else. It lacked a lot of complexity and depth in this area.<br />
<br />
The only plot development came in the form of the forced suspense at finding out who the real mastermind behind Amira&#039;s stealing of the God Key was. And I say forced because they basically used the same old &quot;masked figure&quot; who goes about doing obviously evil stuff in Anatae but they intentionally don&#039;t show us his face just because they want to keep us asking who it is. But this is repeated so many times that we&#039;re no longer interested to find out, or, the more perceptive would already know that this was Lavalley. So again, very limited plot development beyond the main plot line. (+1 for a little development)<br />
<br />
There was one good plot twist though, that Martinet was actually Lavalley, even if it was already hinted much earlier in the Anatae arc, when Lavalley first secretly meets Amira out of sight of everyone else, suggesting that Lavalley was actually a bad guy in disguise. Also, the anime tried not to make it too obvious, by making Lavalley fabricate a fake back story for Amira, as well as making him look like he was trying to stop Jeanne D&#039; Arc&#039;s burning at the stake. (+1 for plot twist)<br />
<br />
3. Coherence / Logical Sense<br />
<br />
There are a whole host of plot holes in this story, but at least the main assumptions of the story are believable - that there are 2 parts of a key that awakens Bahamut when they fuse together, and that it is prophesied that a hero would be able to stop Bahamut, that there exists angels, demons and humans and that Amira could be born of both demon and angel (+1 for believable assumptions)<br />
<br />
The way the plot progressed also at least made some sense, and there were no super obvious flaws in the way the main conflict was presented and dealt with. Plot lines also progressed smoothly without any major anomalies. (+1 for making some sense)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there were many instances where Kaisar reacted very unbelievably and unnaturally, even given his characterization as a narrow-minded person who is greatly affected by everyone around him. From things like crying for Rita, to being over-protective of Amira, to trying to kill Favaro numerous times without even bothering to clarify what happened, to suddenly become super cooperative with Favaro.<br />
<br />
Bonus Points: Not awarded due to 9 plot holes.<br />
<br />
In episode 1, Favaro and Kaisar are pictured on horseback, jumping off a bridge and falling 15 times their own height through the air (roughly 27 metres) before the horses landed on uneven roof tile surfaces. There is no possible way that this stunt could be performed without inflicting some serious injury on both the horses and the rider, and it is definite that the horses wouldn&#039;t be able to continue galloping on top of houses either.<br />
<br />
In episode 3, Kaisar cries over Rita&#039;s zombified body when she turns into a zombie after being bitten by one of her own undead units, but Kaisar literally just met Rita in this episode, and it&#039;s quite far a stretch to say that Kaisar has any feelings for the young girl at this point in time. All he really did was tell Rita about his backstory and have Rita tell him how pathetic the story sounded.<br />
<br />
In episode 4, Kaisar has only just met Amira, but suddenly wants to &quot;protect&quot; and &quot;save&quot; her for no real apparent reason, other than the fact that she is a girl. Kaisar seems to have this weird inclination to protect any girl that he meets, doesn&#039;t he? Or maybe that&#039;s part of his characterization as a noble knight, but it still doesn&#039;t make sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
In episode 5, Azazel claims that the New Orleans&#039; Knights were lying in ambush for his demon ship in Sword Valley, but in the show it clearly shows most of the knights on horseback, holding their flag and emblem high in plain sight - it was clearly a direct confrontation rather than an ambush. It&#039;s not possible that Azazel&#039;s scouts only managed to catch sight of the entire army after they were attacked, since most of Sword Valley&#039;s terrain is flat and there is no terrain cover whatsoever.<br />
<br />
In episode 6, the three archangels, Michael, Raphael and Uriel, decide that letting the humans take care of Amira, who is currently also sought after by the demons, is a lot better than personally sending angels down to guard Amira themselves. I don&#039;t believe the angels lacked manpower since in the last episode, they clearly still had tons of reinforcements and sparing a few to look after Amira would have been a much better idea.<br />
<br />
In episode 11, archangel Michael somehow realizes that the small little unnoticeable purple ball that Rita threw at Jeanne, which bounced off a flying duck, was the antidote for Jeanne&#039;s demon transformation, and decides to give up his own life to turn Jeanne back to normal. There is no way, that Michael would be noticing a small ball in an aerial combat situation between Jeanne and Bacchus, also there is absolutely no way Michael can deduce even remotely that this ball is an antidote that works on Jeanne.<br />
<br />
Episode 12, Favaro decides that cutting Kaisar&#039;s forearm off to fool Martinet into thinking that he was still under his control, and then using the bounty hunter tool on Kaisar&#039;s arm to capture Martinet, was a better option than having Kaisar simply use the tool himself. All Kaisar needed was just for Favaro to block Martinet&#039;s view of Kaisar for long enough for him to suddenly shoot out the wristband in Martinet&#039;s direction and say the commands. It was unnecessary drama and in Rita&#039;s words, &quot;Letting your arm get chopped off, that&#039;s stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, if all Favaro did was to stab a Barb of Bahamut onto Bahamut&#039;s head, then honestly couldn&#039;t any random flying angel or demon do it? All they had to do was pass Favaro&#039;s barb to any flying ally and it was a done deal. From the angels&#039; point of view, it seems like it was a lot more difficult trying to defend against an awakening Bahamut than an already awakened one.<br />
<br />
Plus, if we look back at Martinet&#039;s plan closely, we can see a key plot hole resurface at the start of the anime. If Martinet&#039;s plan was really to get Amira to steal the God Key and then have her bring it to Helheim, why did he simply leave Amira wandering around herself, trying to find a way to get to Helheim? Shouldn&#039;t Martinet have at least given Amira the other half of the pendant so that she could find her way, from the beginning, rather than have some random, unreliable bounty hunter clumsily try to help her find the way there? Martinet made pretty much no effort on his own to positively ensure that Amira would end up and find herself in Helheim, he just basically somehow believed that Favaro would magically lead her there.<br />
<br />
Overall the plot suffers in every department - it lacks a whole lot of depth, it isn&#039;t particularly interesting or exciting, it&#039;s poorly developed and it also suffers from a great host of plot holes. Unfortunately for this 13-episode anime, they couldn&#039;t really pull off the plot well enough.<br />

Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
OP Sequence: 2/2<br />
ED Sequence: 0/2<br />
Animation: 2/3<br />
Aesthetics: 3/3<br />
<br />
The OP Sequence was very well crafted and was beautiful, but I really didn&#039;t like the artistic style for the ED Sequence. On the aesthetics side, I loved the character and setting designs that this anime used - really quite unique styles - from Favaro&#039;s afro to Kaisar&#039;s weird hairstyle to Bacchus and his drunk look and Rita, the kawaii zombie girl, was really a joy to watch. The animation side suffers just slightly a little because I thought Bahamut himself was quite poorly animated and made him a lot less threatening than it could have been. He continued to seem frozen in stone because Bahamut never moved anywhere away from his original location.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
OP Sequence: 1/2<br />
ED Sequence: 0/2<br />
Background Music: 4/4<br />
Additional Themes: 0/2<br />
<br />
The OP Sequence sounds good at first, but after awhile gets really jarring and I kept skipping it after that. The ED Sequence was basically as boring as the animation they put for it. Background music was good though, with a good mix of both eerie and action-packed music. I also liked how they used a lot of vocal orchestra in this - keeping to the Bahamut&#039;s &quot;ancient&quot; theme. No points for additional themes though, because there were none.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
<br />
The main characters are Favaro, Kaisar, Amira and Rita in that order for the protagonists, and Martinet and Beelzebub in that order for the antagonists. The rest of the cast - Bacchus, Hamsa, Jeanne, Azazel, Michael are supporting characters.<br />
<br />
Favaro definitely is one of the most unique characters I have ever come across. More than just having a weird afro, his constant switching between serious to playful, his style of not wanting to do more than he should, yet knowing that he will regret it, and his general ability to joke around even in the most direst of situations really make you want to love him. You can tell he also changes slightly - from going to simply being happy go lucky to actually taking responsibility for his actions and for Amira, whom he learns to really take care of, like a younger sister (+1 to uniqueness, +1 to growth) His backstory though is kind of insufficient, since we really don&#039;t know what exactly happened when his dad and the bandits attacked Kaisar&#039;s dad.<br />
<br />
Kaisar as a character actually falls short of almost anything. He&#039;s a cliched noble knight who fails at doing everything precisely because he keeps trying to uphold these noble values without being able think straight and to make reasonable judgements about the situation. He&#039;s also fairly useless in the entire anime - his only use being to save Favaro from the demon-state of mind at the end - because besides that he does nothing but get in Favaro&#039;s way and is a complete burden to Rita, who can do much better without him. Even while protecting Amira he gets caught together with her and gets locked up in a cage where he could do nothing. Still, at the end he finally learns to put aside his differences with Favaro and managed to, as a team, defeat Martinet in an overly dramatic manner (+1 for growth). His backstory was as insufficient as Favaro&#039;s, since they basically share the same backstory, but at least his &quot;childhood friend&quot; link to Favaro shed more light into his interactions with Favaro and explains how he both wants and doesn&#039;t want to kill him (+1 for character interactions).<br />
<br />
Amira is also a rather interesting character, with superhuman powers of transforming into a one-winged demon and basically just brutally punching her enemies down. She&#039;s also later on revealed to be young, in fact, so young that she technically qualifies as a little kid in spite of her looks. The plot tell us that demons made her age faster using the cocoon, so that her body develops faster and is several years older than her mind. That&#039;s not a bad explanation, but it basically robs Amira of any characterization whatsoever. She becomes a complete and total pawn in this anime, used by Martinet, used by Favaro, used by everyone else essentially, and has hardly any views, opinions of her own, and merely gets told what to do. While she does have an awesome transformation ability, the fact that the anime only made her out to be childish really diminished her role in the plot.<br />
<br />
Rita is by far my favourite character in this anime, and also one of the characters that was better developed than the rest. Rita is a young girl who turns a necromancer after discovering a book, and then uses her powers of reanimating the dead to &quot;play village&quot;. Apparently she&#039;s played village for at least 15 years already and is basically getting sick of it. She eventually runs into Kaisar and Favaro and after failing to kill them, turns into a zombie and starts following Kaisar around. Her visibly nonchalant-looking character and blunt remarks are well-weaved into her &quot;more mature than she looks&quot; archetype. If Amira is the girl who looks older than her age, then Rita is the opposite, a girl who looks much younger than her age, but of course, a more mature character is a lot better for main character types. Rita manages to not only become useful in every situation using a reanimation ability - saving them from soldiers, putting up distractions - but also manages to uncover Martinet&#039;s concoction and, as a somewhat professional herbalist, manages to create an antidote that counters it. What&#039;s not to love about this adorable little child whose only goal is to save her friends? Even though she&#039;s acts rather coldly and cruelly to Kaisar, she shows that she really does care for him, even helping to bandage up the stump of an arm he has left at the end. (+1 for cute amazing character, +1 for multi-faceted nature)<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the supporting cast, they were also a host of very interestingly conceptualized characters. Bacchus, the self-proclaimed god, who basically only drinks a lot and pays bounty hunters whenever they get a bounty, and his amazing duck Hamsa who is more than just a little pet, but proves to be able to fly and deflect projectiles by expanding his body. There&#039;s also Jeanne D&#039;Arc, who is awesome sword fighter capable of wielding a huge-ass sword that can unleash such a devastating blast that it forces Azazel to retreat. Jeanne also sees some character development in the form of her righteous, unwavering nature when she was tempted to take the concoction. Unfortunately, once she turns evil in the later episodes, even after Michael&#039;s sacrifice to restore her normalcy, she ceases any further usefulness in the plot whatsoever. (+1 for interesting, varied cast) And of course, there&#039;s Azazel, who did nothing but get ambushed and took his revenge on Beelzebub. He&#039;s not very developed either.<br />
<br />
On the antagonist&#039;s side, we have the one-dimensional Beelzebub who is so stupid that he doesn&#039;t even know that he can&#039;t control Bahamut even if he bestows upon it the Transcendent Key that he made. Beelzebub basically is a power-hungry monster but ends up getting, and deservedly, brutally incinerated by one of Bahamut&#039;s blasts. He&#039;s so poorly developed that I can&#039;t even consider him a character.<br />
<br />
Martinet is just slightly more interesting because he&#039;s the one doing all the ground work, making sure his evil schemes fall into place, manipulating an angel from long ago, the demon working with him, and various other humans including Jeanne, Favaro, Anatae&#039;s King to make his plans go smoothly. But still, not a word is said about his character or backstory, and his motives for plotting all this evil is even worse - &quot;I just want to watch the world get destroyed.&quot; Way to go, another crazy apocalyptic lunatic.<br />
<br />
For characters, the anime suffers quite a bit from poor character depth and development for a lot of the cast, including main characters, and the antagonists are just so poorly developed that they were basically ignored this entire time. Still, the uniqueness of many of the characters really pulled through and made me enjoy watching the characters interact with one another.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10<br />
<br />
For humour, the anime has done quite well. There is a lot of slapstick on the part of Favaro and Kaisar, who get into trouble plenty of times and have to have their fellow allies save them. Bacchus and Hamsa are also a pretty comic duo, because both have very peculiar sneezes. Also, Rita&#039;s monotonous and blunt remarks at all the stupid situations just make me laugh a lot more. (+2 for comedy)<br />
<br />
In terms of action, the anime also doesn&#039;t fail to deliver. While there isn&#039;t a lot of actual action and fighting scenes per se, there was a decent amount of close combat fighting, sword fighting, all of which were rather well animated and was exciting enough to keep me watching. (+1 for action)<br />
<br />
There were also some hints of emotion in the anime, especially at the part where Amira finally gets to meet her own mother, but in very dire circumstances. Still, she presses on stubbornly to give her a hug, and at the end says that Favaro was right that her mom would recognize her just from the hugging alone. Her kiss with Favaro was slightly unnerving though but at least it gave their relationship a good finishing touch. (+1 for emotion)<br />
<br />
Pacing-wise, the anime was pretty exciting from the beginning, and really set the mood of being an action-comedy flick, as well as introduced our two very interesting important characters of the show. (+1 for pacing) Towards the middle though, as the story slowly progressed and we slowly started to see who was the evil mastermind behind the entire evil plot, things got a lot less interesting as things became obvious and I honestly just wanted to skip to the part where Bahamut awakens. And finally, at the end when he finally does, the resolution was just super anti-climactic, I never even go to know what happened to Rita or the other supporting characters, I only ever saw Favaro and Kaisar.<br />
<br />
This anime has at least earned itself 1 bonus point for not having any filler episodes (not counting the recap episode 6.5, even though it&#039;s useless).<br />
<br />
While I did enjoy most of this anime, there were honestly some parts where it did feel repetitive and got a bit too boring for my liking.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
Altogether, I thought that the plot could have seriously had more thought put into it, while the characters Kaisar and Amira really need a lot more character development as part of the main character cast. It was a fairly enjoyable watch, though I was admittedly disappointed after reading some really rave reviews about this show.

    Shingeki no Bahamut is a series that I don&#039;t seem to love as much as others, which I will explain in detail while trying not to spoil too much.<br />
<br />
First of all, the music and art is great, presenting the show in a spectacular package. Even the occasional CGI monsters works for the most part, sticking out yet without looking lazy.<br />
<br />
I was drawn in by the idea of bounty-hunting and the refreshing design of our swashbuckling main character, Favaro, who brings in just the right balance of charm and goofiness. The conflicting relationships he shares with everyone around him is also an unending spring of entertainment.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177173">
        <br />
<br />
The first episodes present an interesting concept. After bragging at a bar, Favaro unwittingly tricks a demon-girl and gets into a contract with her. Our suave rogue is now stuck with a demon far stronger than himself, who could easily destroy him with the flick of a finger if she realized he lied to her. It had great potential for some mind-games, with Favaro constantly having to lie and outsmart the demon in order to survive.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is where the characters start to show how underdeveloped they are. The demon-girl turns out to be a naïve girl, easily outsmarted by everyone, turning into a plot-device and a damsel in distress. The promise of a great character-dynamic between her and Favaro goes straight out the window. My biggest pet-peeve however is that Favaro suffers from an old shounen-trait, which is that he’s too cool to care about anything. Is Favaro cool? Sure. Does having no clear motivation make him cooler? Not really. If anything it just makes him look like a third wheel when he&#039;s dragged into situations against his will. He even states out loud that he doesn&#039;t know exactly why he&#039;s doing what he&#039;s doing. He says he wants to rebel against destiny and forge his own path, yet his motto is “the wind blows to tomorrow”, symbolizing just how much he&#039;s guided by wherever the wind blows him. In a nut-shell this is what made the characters a let-down for me.<br />
<br />
The story is a mish-mash of ideas that I’ve already seen done better. The great personification of evil that’s about to be awakened after a thousand years. The bickering trio from Samurai Champloo. The literal retelling of Jeanne d’Arc’s legend with the added twist at the end.<br />
<br />
The story has several problems, but one is far bigger than the others. Our title-character Bahamut is not even remotely involved with the main characters until the last third of the series. The angels, demons and Jean d’Arc however are involved with Bahamut early on. I felt like the actual main characters were left to aimlessly wander while the main plot developed in the background.<br />
<br />
Overall it is a well-animated series with an underdeveloped story that never delivers on what could have been something far greater.

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**<br />
<br />
Every now and then, an anime comes along that is so remarkably charming, entertaining, and fun that you just completely forget about the rest of its flaws. Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, is the epitome of this kind of anime. It’s 100% “rule of cool”; a million things are going on at the same time, ridiculous amounts of insanity are crammed into short intervals of time, the characters and plot events are totally over the top, and yet all you can do is smile while watching it. SnB is undoubtedly the pleasant surprise of the season, considering that it’s based on, of all things,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176169">
        the lore of a card game. First WIXOSS and now SnB… Huh. Maybe card games are on to something. Anyway, let’s get to the review:<br />
<br />
Synopsis: This story follows the happenings throughout the world of Mistarcia: a magical clusterfuck where humans, gods, demons, monsters, creatures, etc all must coexist. Long ago, a tremendously powerful being, Bahamut, threatened to destroy the land, but humans, gods, and demons united to seal its power away. The key to that seal was split into two pieces; one half was given to the gods and the other to demons, so that they would never be united and Bahamut would never be released. Two thousand years later, Bahamut threatens to be awakened once more…<br />
<br />
If you think about it, there’s really nothing remarkable about SnB’s premise; I think we’ve all seen the “an evil power sealed away for thousands of years is going to be awakened!” type of thing before. What makes this show so awesome is not in its premise, but in its execution. The show thrives during its stretches where there is very little exposition at all, which is most of the time. SnB knows how to “show don’t tell”, and let&#039;s the plot events do the talking for them. Unfortunately, the show gets away from that winning formula during its middle stretch and begins spending way too much time on the overarching story, which creates a number of problems. As previously mentioned, the plot of this show is really nothing special; it&#039;s way too ambitious for its own good, has holes, and isn&#039;t exactly the most original. When the awesome, over-the-top action slows down, the audience begins to remember that these flaws do indeed exist, hurting the enjoyment gotten out of the anime. Luckily, it pulls itself out of its overly-plot-focussed rut relatively quickly and goes back to the fresh and energetic action you can&#039;t help but love. I really can&#039;t stress enough how nearly every episode presents us with an entirely new scenario in a totally new setting full of insanity and pure fun. For instance, have you ever wanted to see a fight consisting of zombies vs. bounty hunters vs. mermonsters vs. demons vs. a giant crab on board a pirate ship? If you aren’t at least slightly amused by that idea, then you’re a stick in the mud. It’s HARD to not be entertained by the show’s extremely well done action, comedy, and variety of settings. There may not be much depth to the plot, but this anime will make you not care.<br />
<br />
As amusing as the plot may be, the real factor that makes it SnB so endearing definitely has to be the characters. They are a delight to watch every second they are on screen, ensuring that there is never a boring moment. Surprisingly, this cast doesn’t just manage to be mindlessly entertaining because of their personality quirks; they are legitimately well written. Favaro, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, is hilarious, charming, has clearly defined motivations and even has a small semblance of a backstory. Amira, the female lead, is quite similar; she’s charming, she’s funny, she has a backstory, but she is also strong; no misogynistic stereotypes to be found here. Kaiser and Rita are marvelous additions as well, not to mention the plethora of colorful side characters. Some of the cast may be underdeveloped, but they certainly never cease to be entertaining. It has been a long, LONG time since I’ve seen a cast of characters with this much personality. They make the show an absolute blast to watch and you’ll definitely get attached to them.<br />
<br />
To top off the intoxicating style of SnB, it’s worth mentioning that the animation looks completely awesome. For one, this is actually a rare example of CGI done RIGHT in an anime; it’s used sparingly and actually looks fluent when it is used. Besides that, the art style, shot composition, character/monster designs, and animation is all spot on; it makes for an immersive experience that you can’t take your eyes off of. That brings us to the music, which is just as fun and over the top as the rest of the show. The OP gives you a pretty good idea of what you’re getting into and the OST never fails to set the “Fuck yeah!” kind of mood that the show is so good at eliciting. SnB wouldn’t be the same without it’s stellar and stylized presentation.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this anime is likely the most pleasant surprise of the entire year. It ranks right up there with the other best &quot;rule of cool&quot; shows as an awesomely entertaining, funny, action packed adventure with endearing characters and a kick-ass presentation. It doesn’t have a whole lot of depth to it and it’s not exactly going to blow you away, but it’s hard to argue against the fact that this anime is fun as hell to watch. If this kind of show is your thing, I recommend it!

    Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
I like the story because it was like something typical, something cliche at the start, but later, by watching, you realize that it&#039;s going away from this cliche like story and gets actually a really nice short story with some mythology influence in it, many monsters, magic and fantasy. Maybe it was a bit too short, maybe they just rushed it a bit...maybe making 25 episodes would made the anime better, but only maybe, who knows.<br />
I can only tell that i really enjoyed watching it because it was a bit....well, yeah, different :D<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
<br />
Oh god, there are characters i really hated at the start,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185957">
        and characters i really liked at the start...but then, and i never actually knew this could happen...it was the complete opposite. The characters i liked became really annoying while the ones i didn&#039;t really like became really cool after realizing some things. That was a nice experience, i can&#039;t deny it.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10<br />
<br />
The animations in the anime are really awesome, the first episode had such great animations i couldn&#039;t really believe it and it lasted till the last episode. The surroundings and the characters, the movement, everything was fitting greatly.<br />
Really nice and fresh colors, i can&#039;t really complain much :D<br />
<br />
Music: 8/10<br />
<br />
At the start i didn&#039;t really like the Opening theme, but after listening to it a few times, it was stuck in my head for a few days, it was just like the second Death Note Opening, first it was disturbing then i loved it.<br />
The ending was really nice and calm, actually beautiful.<br />
The background music wasn&#039;t bad at all, it was fitting with the moments and the anime itself. It had a nice atmosphere

    Another anime that prove MAPPA’s technical capability, after the success of Zankyou no Terror. We received another amazing anime. So let’s start.<br />
<br />
Bahamut starts with the most enthralling beginning that makes us all excited. We get the usual adventure-slash-fantasy vibe executed in the best way possible. But the problem is, as we get closer to the midway of the show, the mood of the show toned down. I now realized that Bahamut is becoming more boring and dull. It is losing its charm. It becomes less entertaining. For the reason, that Bahamut is not even “trying”. It is not that ambitious of a work to become

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177175">
        more entertaining. That is why in the end, it almost became a generic fantasy adventure anime. <br />
<br />
Bahamut has a cast of a usual fantasy anime but the good thing here was that their characters are well written. We have the awesome Favaro, a goofy bounty hunter with an afro and Kaisar, the gallant bounty hunter/knight. Let’s not forget the childish Amira and her seemingly counterpart which is the grumpy (and badass) Rita. These character might be bound to some overused character tropes but, like I said, that doesn’t matter. They did the role they were supposed to do and that is good.<br />
<br />
Considering MAPPA is from Madhouse, it is not surprising that the animation is beautiful. But it is not only that, Bahamut’s charm is its camera use. The camera is comparable to those of Hollywood fantasy blockbusters. It is like Pirates of the Caribbean in a way! The movement is full of fluidity with well-choreographed fights. The sound is not that bad either, the OP and ED are amazing and the VAs did a OMEGA GOOD JOB!<br />
<br />
Bahamut, although I said that it was going downhill in the second half, is far from disappointment. It is good in its own ways but really needs to work on the narrative. Anyways, this show is solid, fun, and enjoyable. 7/10

    Rage of Bahamut started off feeling like it would be this really epic but lighthearted swashbuckling adventure in a pretty cool fantasy world...but then from about half way through, it tries (and fails imo) to be serious. It loses a bit of its cool, its charm, and fun. <br />
<br />
The main character Favaro is essentially a younger, more energetic version of Jack Sparrow- except he&#039;s a bounty hunter, not a pirate. He&#039;s cool, witty, pretty skilled in combat, and especially good at escaping just about any bad situation. But the rest of the characters are okay at best- Amira&#039;s fluffy, childish personality could be quite charming,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177613">
        but the animation doesn&#039;t really fit that personality. Kaisar is a bit boring. And Rita, the zombie-raising witch, is pretty cool-kind of (slightly) reminds me of Toph from Avatar, but imo she doesn&#039;t get enough time to be as cool as she could be.<br />
<br />
But the problem is that the characters and the setting and the music, and especially the first few episodes, make it feel like this is going to be an adventure. Amira&#039;s goal is to get to Helheim, and she hopes that Favaro will take her there, since she&#039;s convinced that he knows how to get there (and of course, he doesn&#039;t). That gave the impression, at least to me, like they would be going to different towns on a quest to get to Helheim, with Favaro getting into and out of trouble everywhere they go, with Kaisar following them and trying to catch Favaro.<br />
<br />
But then demons and dragons and a war from long ago comes up and it turns into a generic action adventure where the &#039;chosen hero&#039;, Favaro has to save the world...and tbh, I would have rather not had that. Of course, it&#039;s more fun and charming than most animes with this type of story- mostly due to Favaro himself, as well as the music and setting that give it a more adventurous tone. But I don&#039;t like the direction it went, especially since they end up staying in one city for the slower second half. But if I had to give some credit to the second half....(spoiler alert for the very bottom of this review)<br />
<br />
But I must say, the show does leave on a note that gives me hope that if they ever make a second season, that we might actually get that adventure that I craved in the first half.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AGAIN, SPOILERS AHEAD!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally in a show,movie, etc.  like this, they&#039;ll make Amira turn evil, and then everyone keeps telling the main hero that there&#039;s nothing he can do but to kill her, but at the last moment the hero manages to save everyone AND keep her alive. While I do sometimes like that not everyone has to die, there are few shows that I&#039;ve seen that can do it in a way that doesn&#039;t feel too forced, out of the blue, and same-old same-old. <br />
<br />
But in Bahamut, Favaro actually does sacrifice Amira (or at least it seems that way) to save the world. I must say I&#039;m impressed by the fact that it broke that cliche. It actually was a pretty sad scene.<br />

    Here are the three things that made this anime so wonderful:<br />
<br />
1) It created the sense that the world was expansive and filled with mystery and potential adventure, which is something that many other anime have tried to do and failed miserably at.<br />
<br />
2) The characters (for the most part) weren&#039;t cutouts of what is so easy to find in anime.  The main character, Favaro, was intelligent and adroit, but he wasn&#039;t without his faults.  He wasn&#039;t just some guy that was fighting for peace for no other reason than peace.  He has more depth than that, he can be selfish and cold, as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175151">
        well as kindhearted.  Another main character, Kaisar, is constantly trying to get back at Favaro for stripping his family of their social status.  Although he does fit into the role of the always chivalrous character, he at least has a nice dynamic with Favaro.  Amira, the female lead, was well fleshed out.  She has a very childish personality, and it shows at every possible opportunity.  This is a very good personality for her, and it is explained why later in the series (I don&#039;t want to have any spoilers, so I won&#039;t say why).<br />
<br />
and 3) The animation.  It is really well done for the most part.  The character all have their own unique designs (no need to have to differentiate characters only by their hair color like in SOME anime).  The animation is fluid and the chaos and fighting in the show is where the animation really stand out in fluidity and overall beauty.  The only problems that I found with the animation was the monster, Bahamut.  Although he seemed epic and powerful, he just seemed somehow out of place, as if his design and animations didn&#039;t match the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
The plot seemed to be nothing special at first, but the way that it was presented was what sets it a league apart from the competition.  Favaro gets in contact with a wandering, magical girl, Amira, because of his lie of knowing how to get to a place called Helheim.  She really wants to go their and he gets stuck in a contract in which he must take her there.  Eventually they are caught up in an epic battle to save humans, angels, and demons alike.  There adventures lead them through a vast world where they meet all types of magical beings, from g-ds to zombies and everything in between.<br />
<br />
The opening was slightly better than average.  Although the visuals were nice and fit the show well, the song had too much screaming in it.  Although some may like that kind of music, it isn&#039;t my cup of tea.  The ending is a different story.  The music was beautifully done and it was calming.  It was animated in a unique style that was stunning and it fit in perfectly with the music.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime was done beautifully and was well paced.  There was never a dull moment; it was always filled with important plot events that were exciting.  A must watch for anyone that likes anything dark, adventurous, or is just looking for something else to watch that they will love.  It gets a high recommendation!

    Please be warned that this review may contain stuff that by some may be considered as spoilers even though no specific scenes of events of the show are described.<br />
As far as the story goes, this anime has just another anti hero wannabe guided by fate and poorly developed emotions to save the girl and the world plot. It has no innovations whatsoever and in it&#039;s short 12 episodes it develops, in my opinion, even that poorly.<br />
The main character is way outclassed by the world and the happenings around him, never really displaying either the physical strength or the strength of character one would expect a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175917">
        main character to have so that he may deal with the problems at hand. That being said i feel that his emotions and way of thinking are not developed enough on screen for us to see some actual change that would lead him from being just an average bounty hunting rogue to a man who would give his life for a girl or an even higher purpose at that. All in all i consider him to be one of the most boring, weak and underdeveloped main characters i&#039;ve ever seen in an anime.<br />
The girl of this story is even less developed, being a crybaby of epic proportions. She is unable to do anything or resist anything when it really counts even though she is considerably strong normally. As a matter of fact she is a lot stronger than the hero so the whole giving in thing just creates the sensation that it is done on purpose so that the story can move on and so that she needs rescuing when she normally could have just ended most problems very easily on her own.<br />
The &quot;team&quot; has 2 more characters one of which is the former knight (also very weak) who doesn&#039;t actually do anything other that waste dialogue time from the start till the end of the show and a zombie girl who is the most interesting concept of a character in this show but we actually get to see too little of her.<br />
The rest of the side characters have virtually no development and are just casually thrown in here and there so that the story may advance with the exception of Jean who gets a few more minutes of screen time. She is the only human capable of actually doing anything but ultimately gets shut down in a runabout way which also gives the sensation that it is done so that the main character may get the chance to step up and be the hero himself.<br />
This leads us to the main problem of the show which is the bad guys. Personally I am one of those twisted guys that enjoy a good villain more than a good hero most of the time because he can spice things up and admittedly a hero&#039;s greatness can most times be measured by the greatness of his nemesis. I wasn&#039;t expecting to find an &quot;Uchiha Madara&quot; in this show but come on. It felt like the villain here didn&#039;t have any kind of end game other than the &quot;watch the world burn&quot; scenario and we are not even shown why or how he got there.It is not even clear weather he is a demon or a human and how it is exactly that he does what he does. Everything about him is shrouded in vagueness and he is taken down ridiculously easy, easier in fact than most of his so called pawns.<br />
As far as the art goes its is the only feature that i find pretty good as it kind of combines western concepts of knights, armors, castles and so forth with purely anime based concepts of angels, demons and spells. The sound effects and music are also, to say the least, enjoyable.

<br />
One of history&#039;s defining features is the men and women who were willing to take a chance. Concepts such as traversing the Atlantic for colonization, migrating across the western half of North America, or scouting Europe for a new trade route sound fantastical. During the &quot;Age of Discovery,&quot; embarking on an adventure was the norm, with riches and prospects the rewards. Nowadays, an &quot;adventure&quot; usually consists of driving the car to the local toy store. But suppose an opportunity presented itself. Would you shy away from what lie before you, or would you follow your destiny? As Shingeki

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176533">
        no Bahamut: Genesis shows, &quot;it&#039;s not the destination that matters, but the journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Bahamut begins with the stoic Kaisar chasing after the carefree Favaro. One night, Favaro accidentally makes a deal with a woman named Amira. And from there, the story truly kicks off.<br />
<br />
Something that Bahamut executes extremely well is in creating the atmosphere. Medieval towns, magical powers, bounty hunting, angels and demons, dragons, zombies, pirates, massive creatures, war; there is so much attached to the world, and it definitely comes off this way. It simply feels like an adventure. Watching Amira and Favaro dance in a pub or Kaisar and Rita crashing a boat generate an overall mood that is nothing short of wondrous. Dabbling into so many different areas may cause an anime to spread itself thin, but Bahamut&#039;s ability to handle any sort of fictional event that it creates gives it another edge. Examples such as a fog-filled town or dealing with the kidnap of a friend give the characters the scenarios to be themselves, have the plot progress, and allow the action to unfold. It&#039;s constant and clever situations the whole way through, making it never a dull moment.<br />
<br />
Bahamut takes a small misstep when it transitions away from the action and the setting. And that is in the development of its characters. It diverts many resources into making the mood feel perfect at all times (and it does this job wonderfully), but it causes the cast to fall on the wayside. Much of the character development is done through intermittent flashbacks that give just enough information at the time to craft an idea behind how the characters came to be. And this is done for the big three -- Favaro, Kaisar, and Amira. Especially so in Amira&#039;s case; the reveals about her origin, and who she truly is, is done rather hastily, conflicting with the delicate and fine world-building that surrounds her. As the plot progresses, the characters subsequently settle issues among one another, but the only person who seems to change his core beliefs is Favaro. Given how unique the cast is, it&#039;s a shame that such a blunder was encountered.<br />
<br />
Despite being all about adventure, Bahamut does instill a thematic presence. And it&#039;s present from the very beginning until the very end. And this is the idea that nothing can be done alone. Hearkening back to my small preview, there existed ordinary men and women who did extraordinary things. Abraham Lincoln uniting the North and the South, or Marie Curie winning Nobel Prizes comes to mind. While individually their achievements are phenomenal, they couldn&#039;t have done it alone. That is, not without the help of those around them. The same can be said for Favaro and the gang. As much as he or Jeanne de Arc wish to fulfill their tasks by themselves, it&#039;s just not possible. Furthermore, it doesn&#039;t matter who. Whether it is a close rival giving one the motivation to push onward or two conflicting sides making amends to thwart a third evil, events in life are never tackled alone. There is always someone there to bring the support, and Bahamut demonstrates this beautifully.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Bahamut pulls out all the stops when it comes to art and animation.<br />
<br />
The art style also contributes to the feeling of adventure that permeates the show. Mountainous backdrops, glistening forests, Gothic cities, and hazy torture chambers are a small sampling of the varying environments offered. Everything is packed with detail, of both the 2D and 3D variety. The show utilizes expert lighting and camera work, providing the show with an overall pretty shine.<br />
<br />
The character designs are also varied and unique. Favaro&#039;s orange afro and scar, Kaisar&#039;s regal outfit, Amira&#039;s witch and commoner attire, and Rita&#039;s tiny hat with skull-based umbrella make the characters standout not only within their own show but among other anime titles. Their faces forego traditional trends of big eyes and flat faces, instead opting for a more mature, human look. This adds a sense of &quot;realism&quot; to the characters that makes them fit their roles and actions more believably.<br />
<br />
As for actual animation, it is quite stellar. Characters move fluidly, and their expressions are not only visible but movable. The fight scenes incorporate nice choreography, giving the show even more reasons to tout its adventurous trait. From nuclear explosions to flying zombie arms, anything and everything is given a high amount of animation and detail, making all that is contained within rather energetic and alive.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
For Bahamut, its characters are a rather interesting assortment of people.<br />
<br />
The last to be added to the troupe, Rita is described as being an undead-necromancer-&quot;loli&quot; zombie. Hundreds of years old yet the height of a child, she hardly ever lets her emotions get the best of her. Having spent much time essentially alone, she finds solace in the fact that Kaisar and the rest bring her into the group. Wielding deathly powers and alchemical magic, Rita is the resident plot mover, giving Favaro and the gang the chances needed to escape or otherwise cheat death -- much like she&#039;s done herself. With a ton of wisdom and a strange amount of caring for her new friends, if the four of them were a family, she&#039;d be the doting grandmother, watching from a distance but always ready to help.<br />
<br />
As a one-winged fallen demon, Amira is a complex creature. Her childlike attitude, constant hunger, and gullibility make her out to be more kid than young woman. Willing to move forward as opposed to resting on her laurels, she accepts the help of Favaro and the others to bring about her dream of meeting her mother once more in the land of Helheim. Rather resilient and immensely powerful in combat, she is no pushover when it comes to taking on the people standing in her way. Following the family idea once more, she would easily be the grandchild, upon which the others must constantly watch over.<br />
<br />
Kaisar is a knight of proud descent. Chivalrous, strong, and handsome, he personifies what it means to be a ladies&#039; man. His feud with Favaro forces him to follow his flippant foe. And as he does, he encounters Amira, the lady he wants to protect, and Rita, the woman he is constantly chided by. Willing to do what is right regardless of what it means for his own safety, Kaisar&#039;s determination to see events through to their end propels him from everyday soldier to incredible commander. His role is easily that of the mother.<br />
<br />
The fan-favorite (and mine, too) falls to Favaro. Rather crass and unruly, he prefers to have fun at all times, before, during, and after fighting. He starts the tale without a tail and without direction, not fully realizing the gravity of the situation he has found himself in. Overtime, he learns from the others what it means to be a better person. From Rita, he gains the confidence to be the kind of man he should have always been. From Kaisar, he sees what willful and prideful drive can accomplish. And from Amira, he learns that being selfish doesn&#039;t bring about change, but compassion for others that does. By the adventure&#039;s end, Favaro transitions from a narrow-minded buffoon to a legendary hero. Asking himself, &quot;Which way does the wind blow,&quot; he easily represents the father for the four.<br />
<br />
The interpretation of the main cast acting as a singular family -- Rita the grandmother, Amira the child, Kaisar the mother, and Favaro the father -- isn&#039;t a large extrapolation. Not only do their characterizations and developments paint them as such, but the core theme tying them all together does as well. This theme is, of course, the idea that family is more than just a relationship. Each of them does what they do and becomes who they are because of their family. Rita&#039;s first life was based on the love she had for her parents, and her second life was caused by it, too. Amira&#039;s sole purpose, her only reason for living is seeking out the one woman with whom she has the deepest of connections: her mother. Kaisar is motivated by the wrongdoings against his own father and besmirching of his family name. And Favaro saw what became of his own father, and therefore pushed away the ideals given to him; but eventually he took to heart the kind of person his old man had always embodied. Before anything else, family comes first. Friends come and go, work buddies are made and lost, and strangers are passed. But family is always there, both within and around everyone.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
The OP is one word: amazing. The hard guitar, tough drums, and coarse singing make it an adrenaline rush on every listen. The first half is epic and the second half is hopeful. It goes down as one of the top OPs of the year.<br />
<br />
The ED completely contrasts the OP. It&#039;s soft, calming, and beautiful. The piano and violins give it a pretty arrangement, and the vocalist has an incredible range.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is filled with orchestral pieces and choir singing during the tensest of moments, and Spanish-like heroic tunes during the more triumphant ones. They further add onto the adventure-like quality of the anime.<br />
<br />
Voice-acting sees above average work with most of the cast. A stand-out performance is had by Hiroyuki Yoshino as Favaro, perfectly capturing the fun-loving, crossbow-wielding bounty hunter.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
It&#039;s fascinating where this one started. When it was first announced, it was written off as nothing more than a silly card-game adaptation. But after the first episode, it truly became something more. It began proving what such out-of-left-field ideas can do. Crazy set-pieces, unique characters, and mythological happenings all in one place, and all done well, make it its own, rather rewarding product.<br />
<br />
The show is actually quite funny at times, but the action and flashiness of it all makes it worthwhile. Watching a fast-paced duel between Favaro and Kaisar or seeing angels erect barriers to prevent a disaster provided many opportunities to just sit back and say, &quot;Now that is cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
As my final anime of Fall 2014, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis goes out with a bang. Its adventure-filled story, familial characters, stunning animation, and killer music make it more than just a show based on a card game.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Good, perfect adventure, misguided character development, solid theme<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, beautiful art, unique character designs, above average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Good, Rita, Amira, Kaisar, and Favaro are strongly tied to family<br />
<br />
Sound: Great, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, above average VA work<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, funny, eye-catching, and completely out of nowhere<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    Bahamut, a feared silver dragon, has been inert for two thousand years thanks the gods, humans and demons managed to win him. To keep him away of the world gods and demons have a seal they keep in their worlds.<br />
<br />
One day a girl call Amira who only knows she has to find her mother on a land called Helheim arrives to Earth, she brings a amulet which is damaged and she can’t go there, but one night in a tavern she hears a bounty hunter called Favaro saying he’s going to Helheim and he knows an short cut. Amira proposes Favaro a deal who accepts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175033">
        to take her to Helheim, but to make sure he keeps part of the deal she puts him a demon tale, it can only disappear once they get to their destination.<br />
<br />
This anime must be one of the best of 2014, it’s full of moments of plenty of action and made with imagination, we can see bounty hunters, knights, living dead and even the historic character of Joan of Arc. The animation it’s very well done and the design of the landscapes and characters show several hours of work. On the other hand I think the story it a bit dense by having so many characters participating on it, and there are things they could have changed like the moment Favaro rips off Kaisar’s left arm.<br />
<br />
For me there are three characters that are very bored like Hamsa, the duck accompanying Bacchus, he barely makes something in the serie. Bacchus spends most of the inside a wagon and drinking. And Kaisar Lidfort, a knight who belonged to an important family and blames Favaro of all his disgraces, his emotive nature can be irritating.<br />
<br />
Few are the animes that attracted me or I haven’t finished watching but this one was worth watch it until the end. <br />

    Shingeki No Bahamut: Genesis/ Rage of Bahamut: Genesis Spoiler Free Review<br />
<br />
First I would like to state that prior to watching this series I had no idea that it was intended to be a promotional series for a mobile card game, however, taking that into account it only adds to my appreciation for the series.<br />
<br />
I will sometimes just abbreviate the series as SBG to keep things simple, and I will be breaking down this review into a few components: Story, Art/Animation, Sound, Character and overall feelings. <br />
<br />
SBG is a series I had high hopes for and was waiting in anticipation to finish. I took up the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175905">
        series immediately as the last episode was uploaded to Hulu Plus and I enjoyed finishing it in just two nights. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10 Now SBG does not have a totally original or brand new concept for a story. I wont break down and run you through the whole thing as I would like people to watch it and enjoy for themselves, but here is some of my thoughts. To be quite honest, SBG is a typical story seen done many times throughout anime history. Despite this, how well it is executed and the great cast of lead and supporting characters is what makes it into an epic and fun watch. There is a great blend of enough comedy, action, adventure, and fantasy to make SBG into something epic. Although it starts off very episodic meaning that each episode was a different venture or such, when the series hits about episode 6 it takes on a main arc if you will. This arc takes on a more serious tone however it still manages to implement just the right amount of humor to keep things fresh. The ending is not a massive cliffhanger leaving you begging for more and all in all the story is just very well executed.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: 10/10 Art and animation is where SBG truly excels. I remember seeing the trailer for this series back in the spring of 2014, and it immediately gripped my attention with its seemingly smooth CG animation and vibrant colors. Now being able to watch it all the way through all I can say is WOW. The world that was created for SBG is truly a work of artistic masterpiece IMO. It was amazing to see shades and hues of colors that are rarely used in anime. The color pallet is truly very broad and the studio utilized tons of colors. A perfect example of this is in an episode that has our main protagonists taking a dip in a lake. As they look off into the distance they see a beautiful sky filled with 6 different shades of lavenders and purples that all work together in beautiful fashion. I just found it very refreshing to see such a broad range of colors being used instead of being presented with a typical landscape or such. Character models are very unique with one exception. In all honesty one of the main protagonists, Kaisar is really just a Space Dandy clone LOL. But other than him, character models are very well done. The main protagonist Favaro, is very unique and not what you would expect from a lead and the models for all the various demons and Gods were very well done. Lastly we have the fight animation. Whenever I know CG is present in a series I become very skeptical, as it either works and I love it or the contrary. Luckily SBG did a great job of seamlessly integrating the CG models with the traditional style. The CG is very smooth flowing and does not move awkwardly like sometimes seen in other series. The fights in SBG are very smooth and lack any sense of &quot;lazy animation&quot; ie things such as constant flashes and pings. SBG nailed the animation aspect.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 There is one thing that is most memorable about SBG&#039;s sound and that has to be the opening track. Now this is very very very subjective (as is this whole thing as it is a review LOL but you get me) but i gotta say the opening track is just pure badass and adds an intense feel to the cool opening animation. Other than that however, SBG does not have an overwhelmingly great soundtrack. It is filled with orchestral notes and symphonies and is mostly only head during a fight scene or such. These sounds are not the most memorable but they do a solid job of adding the needed ambiance and feel to certain scenes. <br />
<br />
Character: 9.5/10 SBG has three main characters and a great cast of supports. I will discuss the three leads individually and the supports as a whole. First off we have Favaro, the selfish and funny yet loving bounty hunter. Favaro is a great lead as he is not what you would typically expect from an adventure/fantasy series. He is VERY selfish and really only wants to look out for his own good but for some reason he is always very likable due to his great sense of humor and comedic actions. He develops into a very strong lead with a strong will and determination and he is easily one of the most different leads i have seen in a while. Next we have the mysterious girl Amira. Amira is an uber powerful girl who despite her power, is very child like. She seems to be blind to the world and like a child, only focuses on what she truly desires. She learns a ton from Favaro and their companions through their trials and despite her sense of babyness, she never becomes annoying. I never thought to myself &quot;WHY IS SHE ALIVE OR WHY CANT SHE JUST DIE?!??&quot; as I do with many other characters of her archetype. She adds to the humor and comedy of the story but still manages to maintain her sense of badassery as she is truly a powerful character in literal terms. Next up the Space Dandy clone Kaisar who is the exact opposite of our other lead Favaro. Kaisar maintains a constant sense of seriousness and pride throughout the series and his comedic actions incidentally come from being constantly duped by Favaro. Kaisar is still a great character however, and is very likable due to his sense of justice and willingness to do the right thing. Now the support characters, who I feel complete the show. There are many supports on all three sides meaning the humans, demons, and gods. All of the supports are very unique and add more to the series rather than being stereotypical bystanders. One support in particular, Rita became a personal favorite of mine and she adds a ton of comedy through her stoic conversations and by always putting down Favaro&#039;s stupid actions. Overall SBG has a great cast of characters that dont see too drastic of a development as the series is only 12 episodes long, but they are a very likable cast and they never really seem to fit stereotypical archetypes that we normally see.<br />
<br />
Overall Thoughts: Overall I am rating this series a solid 9.5 as I truly did enjoy it a ton. I was surprised by this series and found it to be a truly wonderful experience. I did not think going into watching this that i would fall in love with the cast, the art, and the world that as created. I feel this is an underrated series and I dont believe that its connections to a game should bog down its rating or anyones feelings about it. If you are looking for a fun and epic adventure filled to the brim with action, Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis will not disappoint. Thank you for reading and i really hope you found my review helpful.

              It&#039;s always rather interesting to see what sort of direction a new animation studio takes. Being fresh onto the anime landscape gives you a ton of options to choose from. Will you take the easy path of cute girls and slice of life, or will it be the hard road of heavy action and grandly designed set pieces? As of now, after the three main titles from our latest studio to be born, I&#039;m very happy to say that Studio MAPPA has chosen to take the high road, and the possibilities for their future are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175057">
        only looking brighter every day. So, what sort of work has this budding studio produced lately?<br />
<br />
          On the surface, the story seems like a fairly generic setup for a high fantasy adventure, and that&#039;s because it is, but there&#039;s so much diversity and life brought into this world that it has definitely become a standout setting amongst a backlog of complex high fantasies and Lord of the Rings imitations. There are so many different aspects to this world that are mentioned as either key plot points or just passing glances, and it really helps to create a deep and vibrant world for the characters to interact in. All of this came together to create what I felt was one of the strongest starts to an anime this season.<br />
<br />
          That being said, the story itself still feels a bit generic sometimes and ended up being a bit more predictable than I would have liked. Some moments definitely felt like they were starting to check their high fantasy storytelling guidelines a bit too much. There were also quite a few moments where there was actually too much going on and it was a bit hard to focus on the relevant details, and a lot of them ended up getting lost in the shuffle of back and forth tradeoffs of mythological terminology. However, I did find that I was able to overlook a lot of that because this series truly becomes a spectacle to watch. Sure there&#039;s a ton of complicated back story going on somewhere, but a good deal of the series is focused solely on its spectacle of epic chases and grandly orchestrated battles.<br />
<br />
          The main group of characters, while fairly standard at first, do become endearing enough for me to actually care about. Favaro is our slacker-funnyman bounty hunter charged with escorting Amira to Helheim, and he also seems to take the usual path of being reluctant at first and then gradually warming up to her, but he&#039;s such an energetic and colorful character that his generic nature hardly ever shows up. Amira also manages to transcend the quest item/damsel in distress role and actually turns out to be an incredibly powerful fighter, though this is more so due to the fact that she&#039;s actually a demon. Kaiser also stands out as our typical white knight character with a grudge against Favaro, but the emotional torment that he goes through on this journey still makes him incredibly likable and endearing.<br />
<br />
          However, the minor characters end up being a bit weak by comparison, though that&#039;s mostly due to the fact that there are so many of them, with most of them being deities of some sort with either a heavenly or demonic leaning. While some do exist as characters in their own rights, most of them are there simply to advance the plot and are swiftly dropped from the story when they no longer become relevant. Furthermore, I&#039;m not really sure how the Japanese view western mythology and biblical characters, but to have three completely separate characters named Beelzebub, Lucifer, and Satan was extremely confusing for a good portion of the series.<br />
<br />
          As previously mentioned, the animation was produced by Studio MAPPA (Terror in Resonance, Garo the Animation), and as a spectacle of gigantic set pieces and grandly orchestrated battles, this anime was an incredible sight to behold. Everything about this series felt immense in size and really helped to push the hype for the series forward. The character designs were also incredibly detailed and original, adding a much needed refresher to the usual fantasy character tropes. However, I do have to point out that there is a massive amount of CG in this series, and a lot of it didn&#039;t look as good as it could have been. It&#039;s understandable that the scope of this series is so massive that you have to save time and render certain objects in CG, but there were still some moments where it just looked really bad. As for Bahamut himself, I found myself feeling a little bit disappointed. Yes, he certainly felt very threatening, but again, the CG work wasn&#039;t all that it could have been, though thankfully it did not give me any flashbacks to the original Fate/Stay Night.<br />
<br />
          There is currently no dub for this series, though a FUNimation dub in the distant future isn&#039;t out of the question.<br />
<br />
          The soundtrack was composed by Yoshihiro Ike (Ergo Proxy, Karas), and this is definitely one of the most massive-sounding soundtracks I&#039;ve heard this season. Huge, bombastic orchestration combined with grandiose choirs and pounding percussion drummed up a huge level of excitement for each battle, but there were also quite a few more adventurous themes, particularly the music associated with Favaro, which actually had a bit of a bullfighter flair to it. The opening theme &quot;EXiSTENCE&quot; by SiM blasts into each episode with a massively metal &quot;Engrish&quot; track, while the ending theme &quot;Promised Land&quot; by Risa Shimizu (VA for Amira) plays us out with a rolling ballad.<br />
<br />
          Overall, while the spectacle aspects of Rage of Bahamut were incredibly exciting, a good portion of the story and characters were rather difficult to follow, and the massive amount of unrefined CG took away from a few of the bigger moments.

    A fun, action fantasy adventure with gorgeous visuals and a charming cast.<br />
<br />
★★★★<br />
<br />
Rage of Bahamut isn’t the most amazing or original show out there, but it’s without a doubt thoroughly enjoyable. It doesn’t try to be deep or complex. It has a Pirates of the Caribbean feel of fun and adventure. It’s a story about a bounty hunter helping a girl get to her destination, but they get swept up in the bigger picture involving humans, angels, demons, and a world destroying dragon.<br />
<br />
The first thing you’ll notice about Bahamut is it’s a very good looking show. The fantasy setting is a breath of fresh air from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176121">
        seeing yet another high school classroom. The fantasy elements aren’t trying to re-invent the wheel. You’ve got swords, giant crabs, necromancy, and hot demon chicks. The quality animation keeps every episode and scene a treat to look at.<br />
<br />
The character designs are refreshing, too. The main character isn’t a generic pretty boy with bangs or impossible spikes. He’s got a red afro, he’s tan—even his personality is fun from the usual apathetic or wimpy or try-hard main characters. Everyone is drawn much more to proportion which is also refreshing from the usual moe baby features and bug eyes.<br />
<br />
The cast is kept small. You’ve got your care-free main character who’s just looking out for himself so he’s got questionable morals. He has a righteous knight after him for revenge, but they have great buddy chemistry. There’s a naïve demon girl trying to find her mother, and even a little zombie girl with a “deadpan” look on her face that injects some pragmatism in the their plans.<br />
<br />
The story starts off lightheartedly to reel you in while the visuals and setting keeps you hooked, but it escalates until they’re on the verge of bringing back a 2,000 year old apocalypse. Some might regret that it loses its initial charm, but the characters keep you invested even if the story becomes a generic “save the world.”<br />
<br />
I don’t have any gripes. At best you could say the fantasy story isn’t original, but even that is an un-original, almost dishonest complaint against anything. Everything’s been done so you can only put new twists on it. Bahamut is easily one of 2014’s best shows, and shouldn’t be missed.<br />

    Okay so it&#039;s a pretty terrible show. <br />
<br />
The scenario is uninteresting as fuck (it&#039;s basically Diablo 3), the characters are full cliché, the universe has been seen a thousand time. <br />
<br />
But OH. MY. GOD. THIS. ANIMATION. <br />
This is simply stunning. It has been a bit eclipsed because of Unlimited Budget Works but this is simply one of the most beautiful anime I&#039;ve ever seen in term of animation and art (but not the most original). <br />
<br />
It&#039;s like the creator of the card game went to MAPPA with a bag of gold without having any idea of how much an anime cost normally and asked them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182417">
        to do it with it. I&#039;ve rarely seen such an explosion of budget. <br />
<br />
Definitely worth the watch, because it&#039;s beautiful. But don&#039;t expect an interesting scenario.

    Having randomly stumbled upon this Anime, I didn&#039;t know what I&#039;d get. All I knew about it was that it was a Fantasy Anime, which I&#039;ve seen a lot. So I thought it&#039;d be some generic Anime which I&#039;d forget about in a heartbeat. But I&#039;m happy to say that that&#039;s not the case here. So, on to my review.<br />
 <br />
                                            

          <span style="display: none;" id="review175197">
                            Story:-<br />
<br />
We&#039;re first introduced the world of Mistarica 2000 years ago, humans, demons and gods resided. During that period there arose the Bahamut, a mystical dragon that tried to destroy the world. But the demons, humans, gods worked together in order to seal the demon and in turn, the key to is seal was made. That&#039;s all the backstory needed.<br />
<br />
What I really liked about the story was that despite being linear and somewhat unoriginal, it still had enough twists and turns to keep me engaged from start to finish. The brilliant first episode introduced the main three characters and set the stage for the story and the many unexpected things to come. The Anime expertly manages to blend the elements of the ongoing war between the humans, angels and the demons without it feeling stale. The story has great pacing, and is compact. I never had a dull moment. The best thing of all was that the ending was absolutely great. It ended on a great note and honestly left a huge smile on my face.<br />
<br />
                                                         Animation and Sound:-<br />
<br />
One word for the Animation, fantastic! The Animation is technically sound. The greatness is prevalent during the action sequences which were breathtaking to say the least. The 3D Animation here is actually well executed, unlike most Anime I&#039;ve seen. Also the varied landscapes and environments were richly detailed and had a vast array of colours which made me love the world all the more.<br />
<br />
The Anime doesn&#039;t disappoint in the sound department either. From the great orchestral sounds during battle sequences to the comedic moments, it was great. The OP is hugely addicting and I liked it a lot. The heavy metal combined with some Engrish made for a great minute and a half. The ED is good too, so that&#039;s all I can say about it. <br />
<br />
                                                               Character:-<br />
<br />
The characters made this show, quite frankly. Favaro is easily my favourite character. From the first moment I saw him, I knew I&#039;d like him. He&#039;s a bounty hunter by profession. His roguish behaviour, his devil-may-care attitude and general panache made him a delight to watch. Also count his witty banter with the rest of cast and we have ourselves a memorable character.<br />
<br />
Kaisar, Favaro&#039;s best friend, is his polar opposite in character. He&#039;s a knight fallen from grace who had no choice but to become a bounty hunter. He&#039;s serious, uptight and has a strong sense of righteousness. He also has a bone to pick with Favaro for a reason which I can&#039;t discuss. His interactions with Favaro was great right from the start.<br />
<br />
Finally, we have our female lead, Amira. Her introduction made me think she&#039;d be nothing more than a damsel in distress and fanservice character. But that&#039;s not the case at all. She&#039;s an oddball of sorts, who acts like a kid on various occasions. But her child-like curiosity towards ordinary things is endearing. Her development takes quite an interesting twist, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Now for the supporting characters. Firstly, Rita. She is easily the best side character. Her introduction made me think she&#039;d be a one-episode affair, but that didn&#039;t happen. She also surprisingly provides comedic relief to the show. Special mention to Bacchus. He&#039;s a drunk God who can kick ass when the time calls for it. There&#039;s also a few characters who serve as the villains here. Nothing much to say about them other than the fact that they perform their roles well. Overall, all the characters were memorable.<br />
<br />
                                                        Enjoyment and Overall:-<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t help but easily recommend this Anime. It is a perfect combination of action, feels, excitement without a single boring moment. Easily one of the best Anime of 2014. So yeah, give it a watch. It&#039;s definitely worth it.

    Shingeki No Bahamut:<br />
<br />
MINDSET:<br />
Cool, fun and epic-ish action adventure show that should not be taken seriously. Only watch it for the woeful and charmful rather than OMG! I&#039;m f**king crying bruv!<br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS:<br />
Afro Ginger Bounty Hunter/Asian skinned protagonist encounters a demon girl, in which he became a demon in the next day. After that, we found out that she has some flipping item inside her body that is really important according from the fantasy realm she lives in, and now they want it back. Without question, Afro Ginger decides to venture with the demon named Amira to rid his curse for having a tail.<br />
<br />
REVIEW:<br />
This show is more like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review176349">
        Afro Ginger goes to an epic adventure involving demons with simple-minded action while following the rule of cool. It strays away from being serious or follow some sort of theme to make things fascinating. This is further emphasised by the characters alone, since these people never really develop and you get to know them better further in duration, but there is no change to Afro Ginger being a silly thief, to a noble knight. They are in respect, two dimensional characters; they have a reasonable motive behind their actions yet are governed by two personalities. Like Kaisar, a man of nobility but desires vengeance towards the protagonist, Afro Ginger.<br />
<br />
 Now it is more subtle than just “action” since involving travel can make a lot of villains to hunt down is not enough and they need to involve plot. No. Having a succubus and a demon lord who has Yaoi inspiration while the two doing jack for the most part is not serious! The show is more plot involved and trying to get the characters to fight whatever random sh*t comes ahead. Now, it has potential from the first episode to be something more than that, but the characters (especially Ginger) address that this show is far from deep or anything nerdgasm&#039;able from epicness.<br />
<br />
No, conveying a loli with Kaisar for assistance as a necromancer was clearly implanted that she’s just their to help out in many battles. (trying to spoil little) Through more time, the show is trying to create some sort of concrete plot involving a capture with this demon chick because she contains a certain item inside of her and involving kidnap felt far from epic. Why do we care about these people? There is no actual development, there is no reason why we have to really care from their pasts and their wasn’t enough screen for us to get attached. <br />
<br />
It seemed quite out of nowhere that Amira&#039;s stated persona was that of a Kudere, after getting drunk on wine, she was re-written into a tomboy throughout the entire show. Well I guess that would make things quite boring then, though it could&#039;ve been fine if we just let her personality stay as the time she was drunk right from the get go, but whatever.<br />
<br />
Through all of the points I have said, this makes the plot rather predictable due to the shows light-heartedness, there was no scene in this show when I felt it was being dramatic and even if You can&#039;t predict when the moments of sh*t hitting the fan, it does seem easy to predict how its going to play out or end. You know if they kidnap some of the cast to mythical dimension that Afro Ginger is going to save them, and come back alive. Well it did felt that way, and the show can make things a bit more interesting in the presentation of this bit of the narrative for it to be better.<br />
<br />
The animation looked more high budgeted than anything else, other than some pretty cheesy CGI at times, it was&#039;nt too bad and the backgrounds look very detailed and the action scenes just are fluid, and look awesome at the same time. Character designs all blend quite well together with strange hair styles, and everyone look memorable to look at. Clear effort was put into this and the budget remained very consistent all throughout.<br />
<br />
The music consisted of orchestral tunes than anything else, no fancy electric guitar excluding the OP/ED songs, it tends to have a decision of either using a western theme, or an epic orchestral theme. Though it works well with the material given. The OP did seem a little unpredictable and doesn’t suit the show that much, but it was really trying to follow the rule of cool than anything else.<br />
<br />
LEGACY:<br />
One of those “epic” shows that turned out to be “cool” but it may be predictable at times, but was it bad. No. I suppose everyone were needlessly unconsciously masturbatingly bondaged to their Urobuctchers and the f**king FSN remake which allowed the anime to left under the rug from mass appeal.<br />
<br />
CRITICAL SCORE:<br />
CHARACTERS: 6.5/10 – The characters (without the use of Archetypes) fit the material quite well. Though far from complex.<br />
STORY:  6.5/10 – Its more of a cool action/adventure show than anything else. Plus point five for the road journey and epic-ish narrative.<br />
ANIMATION: 7.5/10 – Cool action scenes, great back drops and AFRO GINGER. What else is there to say? <br />
SOUND: 7.5/10 – Great OP, and nicely done acoustic variety OST.<br />
<br />
FINALE: 7/10 (afro ginger ftw....) <br />
<br />
PERSONAL SCORE: (enjoyment)<br />
6/10 – Since the story is quite meh to how I see it, so I lost interest ages ago. All what I wanted to see were the characters just being themselves while watching some great action. Was it epic? No.
