        go of an unreachable past, and taking control of one&#039;s own life. Though they&#039;re not necessarily very obvious throughout the movie, the final scene symbolizes these themes, and what the main characters decided on in the end. <br />
<br />
The character we follow through the movie is Takaki Tohno, and we get to see how he looks on the events that unfold as a child, a teenager and finally, and adult. We see how he develops through these stages of life, and how it all relates to his childhood friend and love, Akari Shinohara.<br />
<br />
The emotions are protrayed in an incredibly beautiful and realistic way; how they portray the love between Akari and Takaki, how they portray the girl who has a crush on Tohno during his high school years, Kanae Sumida, and finally, how they portray their development from children to adults all makes them characters you&#039;ll place your heart with. They&#039;re characters you&#039;ll love, feel sad with, and you&#039;ll wish for them to live happily.<br />
<br />
The animation quality is astounding, from the detail in backgrounds to the astounding ligthing effects and camera angles that help bring the mood of the scenes to a level different from mostly anything else. The only beef I have is that the characters&#039; faces lost a bit of detail from time to time, but aside that the movie is a visual pleasure that goes beyond pretty much everything I&#039;ve ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Tenmon, who&#039;s made the soundtrack to other Shinaki films, does an astounding job on the soundtrack for the movie, with piano pieces that effectively and beautifully amplifies the mood of the movie, be it melancholy, calmness or nostalgia. However, if you don&#039;t like piano soundtracks, chances are you&#039;ll not like it, since it&#039;s mostly the piano that&#039;s used throughout the movie (I love them though, and that&#039;s what made me give it a 10).<br />
<br />
The seiyuu also do a marvelous job of portraying the characters, their emotions and age. I&#039;ve only watched the Japanese version of the movie, so I can&#039;t say anything about the quality of the English voice acting. But I&#039;d recommend it in Japanese anyways =)<br />
<br />
5 cm per Second is a movie that takes a story of growing up and makes it into something that cannot be described as anything less than a masterpiece, with astounding themes, storytelling, art and sound. If someone told me I could watch one movie before I died, I&#039;d undoubtedly choose this one.<br />
<br />

    I&#039;m...confused. I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. I was absolutely sure that this was going to be one of those works of art that leaves you breathless, sitting there for minutes, maybe even an hour after it finishes, just trying to take it all in. <br />
<br />
If you love this movie, you will most likely hate me for this review. Call me someone with a heart of ice, whatever you will. I am simply expressing my thoughts on it. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll break this into a two-part review. The first part will be my thoughts, written as I think of them, the second part an analysis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152561">
        with numbers for those who prefer it that way. <br />
<br />
Oh, I am sitting here, after watching the movie, but it&#039;s not out of awe, it&#039;s out of bewilderment because despite all the reviews and recommendations from ,everyone that proclaim it the best movie ever, that the message of it is poignant and beautiful...I can&#039;t say that I fully agree. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m a heartless robot who has never felt love before, you would say, but no, I&#039;ve cried and felt emotional at even the smallest hints of feeling, and I&#039;ve most definitely been in love, known what it&#039;s like to feel heartbreak, desolation, the chill when you know the person you love will never share your feelings. But for some reason...I couldn&#039;t relate to this movie, try as I might. <br />
<br />
Why did this movie completely fail my expectations? I&#039;m still trying to make sense of it as I write this review. I&#039;m a bit disappointed in myself, because it seems everyone else except for me was touched by this anime while I appear to be some stone-cold freak of nature. I had the tissues ready, the feels shield up, the family relocated to another room so that I could peacefully watch this and take all the dialogue in. <br />
<br />
The most outstanding issue in 5 Centimeters per Second, for me, is that I don&#039;t feel that there was enough character development. I understand. Toko is in love with Akari, and in the first part, she reciprocates his feelings, but they can&#039;t be together. Yes, that is sad, but the way it was expressed just didn&#039;t seem to impact me. At the end of the movie, I don&#039;t know anything about them except that they&#039;re star-crossed lovers who, unfortunately, can&#039;t be with each other.<br />
<br />
The movie does have wonderful messages in it. You have to move on from the past, learn to let go, and know when it&#039;s time to move on. However, I don&#039;t think that message is unique to this movie only. I&#039;ve seen it expressed many times before. The story is interesting, but I think it needed a lot more plot and character development. <br />
<br />
Yes. We can relate to the characters as they experience loss, heartbreak, falling in love for the first time. But for some reason, I didn&#039;t feel as though there was enough effort put into making the watchers really connect, to strengthen that link of empathy. I appreciate the symbolism used in this anime. The messages are indeed deep and something that many can relate to, but in my opinion they were not conveyed in the right way. I also think that some of the lines from the movie are elegant...Overall, this anime seemed to have all the elements to be wonderful, but for me, they didn&#039;t come together. <br />
<br />
And for you data analysts out there, have a breakdown by numbers:<br />
<br />
Story :: 7<br />
It started out promising, but spiraled into something a bit boring and, at least for me, terribly predictable. The story is well-thought out and I liked how it was broken up into three parts, but it moved very quickly, and at the end I found myself shocked that there wasn&#039;t something more. It would have been much better if even half an hour was given to plot development. The way the story is played out is in soft hints of emotion, feelings that can be easily related to, and in a relatively tranquil way, but because of this, I felt that it was difficult to find the actual point of the plot. When the movie ended, I sat there and asked myself, &quot;so what?&quot;. The answer was simply that &quot;We have to learn when and how to move on&quot;. I was hoping that I would have been able to think of more. I appreciate, though, how it was portrayed realistically throughout, with nothing cheesy or sugar-coated. <br />
<br />
Art :: 9<br />
Ah, but I do have to say, the artwork in this movie is outstanding! The backgrounds, lighting, climate, everything. I was spellbound by the gorgeous landscapes that were concocted, with the perfect touch of surrealism and fantasy at every part. You see a routine town setting, and then look up at the sky...a nebulous wonderland, full of stars, conveying the idea that there really is no boundary to where we can go. I can&#039;t give this category a 10, however, because the people were somewhat disconcerting amongst all this scenery. I didn&#039;t feel as though as much effort was put into drawing them, and they looked a bit odd at times. <br />
<br />
Sound :: 9<br />
I play the piano, so all the piano songs in the background stood out and they really did provide a lovely backdrop for the movie, which is peaceful and not full of action or drama. The background music could most certainly put me at ease in any situation. I also appreciated the realistic sound effects, reminiscent of the sounds in a Miyazaki movie. It&#039;s clear that a lot of effort was put into this movie.<br />
<br />
Character :: 6<br />
These characters should be relatable. At times, I felt like I could relate to them. However, they were greatly lacking in personality development. Maybe, though, it&#039;s the point of the movie. As was noted in an article that I read some time ago, if the characters in a work of art are relatively simple, we use them as blank canvases on which to paint our own emotions. I think I would have appreciated a bit more character structuring, though. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment :: 6<br />
Like I said in the beginning of this review, I sat there the entire move trying very hard to like it. At some points, I did. I could appreciate the messages, clear or somewhat hidden, that were being given. However, for most of the movie, I was bored, as though I was waiting for something to happen. Maybe this is because I thought it would be a lot more sad than it turned out to be. <br />
<br />
Overall :: 7<br />
The messages in 5 Centimeters per Second are beautiful. I believe that they should have been conveyed more through character actions than through them having to tell a story to us using words. As I continue through my life, perhaps I will encounter scenarios that will make me think of this movie. I would still recommend that people watch this movie, because there are lessons to be learned and chances are that they&#039;ll enjoy it much more than I did, looking at the sheer amount of 10s that this movie has received. Until then, I&#039;ll continue pondering this movie, and why I, usually so quick to empathize with others and share emotions, was not moved by this piece. If my opinions change, I will be back to write another review. As was the message of Howl&#039;s Moving Castle, hearts can change, and people can too.

    I happened upon this anime in several anime fan sites as it was considered one of the higher rated animes even until today. Reading how some people said it rivaled works that of Miyazaki, I had high expectations for it. But unfortunately it was a total letdown.<br />
<br />
The only thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the animation quality and detail that was put into the movie. The animation was just simply beautiful from the vividness of the background to the fluid motion of characters but then, sadly, the praise ends here.<br />
<br />
The story and the characters were very anti-climactic as no real progress is met

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3980">
        by the characters with one another. This is however how the creator of the story wished for it to be i think as the title is named &amp;quot;5 centimeters per second&amp;quot;. It was a collection of short stories about human distance. I&#039;ll say though that the concept and execution were nice but the story itself was lacks proper closure as it presents the audience with the concept but then leaves it at the presentation with no real conclusion. The story began as a cultured glass of wine then slowly transforming into wine in a box. The depth slowly filled in as the stories progressed. They were written just so that a concept could be brought to stage and left there to be a static attraction for the audience.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re looking for a totally artistic and visually pleasing feature with no real concern for a happy ending with much depth in the end then give this one a looksy.

    Makoto Shinkai is a fairly big name in the industry of anime films. The mind responsible for Voices Of A Distant Star and The Place Promised In Our Early Days among others, he has made his name for creating absolutely stunning landscapes, coupled with beautiful animation, set to simple stories of romance. And amongst his movies, 5 Cm Per Second is often hyped up to be the best.<br />
<br />
Now, let me get this out of the way now: The visuals in 5 Cm Per Second are nothing short of amazing. Shinkai creates some of the most brilliant landscapes I have ever seen. He emphasises the seasons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29867">
        with absolute perfection, bringing out all the most beautiful aspects of Spring, Summer and Winter (Fall is not pictured in this movie), making an incredibly immersive experience. Coupled with some of the highest-end animation I&#039;ve ever witnessed, the visuals are probably the single biggest draw of the film, and I seriously recommend that you watch this in the highest quality that you possibly can.<br />
<br />
The story is separated into 3 acts, the first being about two childhood friends, Takaki and Akari, who were separated by distance. They keep in contact, but as one of them is about to move elsewhere, the other makes a journey to see them one last time. The second shows Takaki in high school, and is told from the perspective of another girl who is desperately in love with him. The final act shows Takaki and Akari as adults, showing the epilogue to their love separated by distance.<br />
<br />
The story, in all honesty, is very lacking. The actual plot of them is pretty much summed up in the above paragraph, with the rest of it simply being character interaction and focus on the scenery. This could actually have been the formula for a brilliant movie, but the problem is that the characters all fall completely flat. Not a single one gets any development, and we barely get any feel whatsoever for their personalities. Rather than putting any focus on the characters, the movie only really cares to use landscapes to convey emotion rather than giving us anything remotely human.<br />
<br />
Now, this may make it sound like this movie is bad, but to tell the truth I can&#039;t really bring myself to say it is. The story and characters may be completely 2-dimensional, but the story overcompensates with enormous production values, and it actually works. Hell, if you&#039;re the kind of person who generally likes love stories then you&#039;ll probably really enjoy that side of it as well. In essence, it&#039;s good if you&#039;re into that sort of thing. Even if you aren&#039;t, I&#039;d still recommend watching this just for the amazing depth of the environment Shinkai builds.<br />
<br />
However, one thing that should not go unmentioned is the song at the end of the movie, &quot;One More Time, One More Chance&quot; by Masayoshi Yamazaki, which is quite possibly the largest concentration of pure, unbridled tearjerker ever compressed into a single song since Johnny Cash performed Hurt. The soulful voice, combined with the beautiful imagery and shots of the couple in their young adulthood bring home the entire plot perfectly in a way that will have you crying your eyes out in no time.<br />
<br />
Overall, 5 Cm Per Second is overrated, but generally entertaining and far from the worst way to kill an hour or so, and if you&#039;re a fan of romantic stories then you&#039;ll absolutely love it.<br />
<br />
Final Words: A must-see for fans of romance, and a great example of scenery porn for everyone else.<br />
<br />
Animation/Graphics: 10/10<br />
Story/Plot: 5/10<br />
Music/Background: 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10

    A major letdown from the supposed &#039;Next Miyazaki&#039;<br />
<br />
I was skeptical about the assertion that Makoto Shinkai was the next Miyazaki, and although I really liked he two previous works, Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days, I could not bring myself to lavish him with such high praise until he made a movie that blew me away and that would become an instant favorite. It would seem that I made a wise decision. Miyazaki is undoubtedly one of the greatest anime directors to ever live, and his films (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke) rival those of any genera, animation or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7341">
        otherwise. He&#039;s been said to be on par with Disney, but that is a lie. Miyazaki is BETTER then Disney. So obviously I&#039;m always skeptical to people comparing an up and coming director to Miyazaki. <br />
<br />
I watched Shinkai&#039;s carrier with great interest from his debut film Voices of a Distant Star to this new film. His strong suits have always been animation and music. No anime director I&#039;ve ever seen can create such beautiful animation as he, and few can combine such stunning and magnificent animation with just the right music to set the tone and take his viewers far away to walk the snow covered streets along side the characters. He&#039;s great at this, but for all that talent he also has a critical flaw to his style which makes his movies miss their full potential; he has no idea what pacing means. Being only 23 minutes long, Voices was paced very well and never had a dull moment, but the follow up Places, being full length, was paced so badly it made me want to skip large portions of the film so I could see some more beautiful landscaping. If the animation and music weren&#039;t so great, I doubt so many people would love that movie so much, even though I personally gave it 4 stars. <br />
<br />
But now, with his third film, I expected him to have found away around that weakness and create a film that wasn&#039;t just visually beautiful, but also well paced as well. Well sorry, but he hasn&#039;t done it, and my patience with him is wearing thin. In this three part film Tonoo and Akari are best friends in grade school who spend all their free time with one another, but as they grow up they slowly drift apart, contacting one another at first through letters and then falling out of contact altogether. It is, surprise, surprise, another romance. This would not have been a problem if this new film didn&#039;t seem like a carbon copy of Voices and Places, especially places. Guy and girl fall in love at an early age, guy and girl drift apart as life goes on and they grow up, guy and girl never get over each other and miss the other, guy and girl sit awake in their rooms all night thinking about the other, guy and girl never see each other again. If you&#039;ve seen Places you can pretty much see everything that&amp;rsquo;s coming. There are no surprises here, just gooey romance.<br />
<br />
It&amp;rsquo;s a real disappointment to see an animator with so much promise get bogged down in these silly romances again and again and again. Voices was good, Places was as well, but Shinkai always tells the same exact story. Its not that he likes telling a certain kind of story, it&amp;rsquo;s that he likes telling only ONE kind of story, every single time. Get a grip man; make something a little more original. Its bad enough that his pacing is so bad but why even bother making new movies when you&amp;rsquo;re just going to tell old stories again and again and again? If this is all Shinkai has to offer then it&amp;rsquo;s not worth my time seeing every film he comes up with. <br />
<br />
The animation, as always, is brilliant. I just don&#039;t know how much more I can gush over his amazing art. I&#039;ve been saying this since Voices, but his three films are THE BEST animated films I&#039;ve ever seen, and I&#039;ve seen my fair share. Unfortunately this film is missing something; the music. Both his previous films have amazing musical scores that made the film just that much better. I never fail to catch myself humming their main themes after watching them without even noticing. Well I&#039;m not going to end up humming these tunes, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. For one thing there wasn&#039;t enough BGM to begin with, and what little there is was just a remix of old themes. But the biggest disappointment was the ending song. It&amp;rsquo;s just not pretty; I&#039;m sorry, but Japanese isn&#039;t the most beautiful language to listen to. The ending song was nowhere near beautiful, in fact I found myself turning the volume down and playing a song of my own instead. If they had only play &amp;quot;Don&#039;t Say Goodbye&amp;quot; from Skillets album Comatose then it would have been the greatest scene ever (trust me, listen to the song and watch the scene and you&#039;ll see what I mean). <br />
<br />
So no, this is not the next Miyazaki, not even close if this film is any indication. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever given a Miyazaki film less then 4 stars, he is far and away the most consistent director I&#039;ve ever watched, so if Shinkai can&#039;t pull it off after three tries I think its an unfair comparison. <br />
<br />
Replay value; low.<br />

    I am sure everyone is going to yell at me for what I am about to write, and put me on some hate list, so let me begin by apologizing to anyone I enfuriate with this review.  Needless to say, this is one of my least favorite animes, and it just sort of rubbed me the wrong way.  I believe it best to list the positives the anime has before I go into the negatives, it does an excellent job of setting up a sense of realism and a pretty good job of drawing you in.  Additionally, it sets up a good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41031">
        sense of normalcy and its really easy to follow the logical progression of the story.  The voice actors and the art are good, they&#039;re not exceptional by any stretch of the imagination, but they can help to immerse you in the story.<br />
<br />
There are two problems I have with this story.  The first is even though each episode is seperate, they should have some sense of overarching story, and unless it&#039;s force-fed to you that is almost non-existant in this anime.  As a matter of fact, it wasn&#039;t until about half-way through the second story that I was given confirmation that I was even watching the same character as in the first episode.  Now my largest problem is one which is probably exclusively my own is the fact that it&#039;s just a depressing anime.  Yeah, I can already feel the hate posts, but I feel that the characters are flat and to be fair too real for me to enjoy.  What I mean is that you never really witness the characters evolve throughout the story, they evolve in the space between each episode but you never really witness it.  As to the realism part to avoid spoilers let&#039;s just say that they give up and I&#039;m torn between whether your supposed to feel bad for the main character or just accept him.<br />
<br />
So I apologize to whoever I just offended, please hit helpful or not helpful and drop me a comment to let me know what I&#039;m doing right, and what I&#039;m doing wrong.  Thanks for reading.

    I watched this at AX earlier this month but didn&#039;t want to write a review till subs are out.<br />
<br />
5 Centimeters per Second is Makoto Shinkai&#039;s latest work, and this one doesn&#039;t disappoint. <br />
<br />
Story: Much like his other works, Voices of a Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days, the theme for this anime is &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot;. Shinkai perhaps, have mastered story-telling of this theme. He crafted each episode so well with this theme that you can&#039;t help but be moved. Each episode uses the theme but each potrayed in a different way. The first episode being the physical distance between our characters. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review615">
        second being the distance in feelings. And the third being the distance in time. This movie will bring you to tears or close to it because of how well its told.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: Be warned, the animation of this movie along with an hd encode may cause blindness, so come in with high expectations.<br />
This movie has probably the most beautiful animation ever. The art direction and scenery in this movie will just blow you away. I have never been so impressed like this.<br />
<br />
Sound: Tenmon never ceases to amaze. I never thought his work in The Place Promised in Our Early Days could be surpassed, but I was wrong. This movie would not be what it is if it wasnt for this awesome soundtrack. Each bgm is beautifully composed and works so well with the scenes. The theme song is just as good and fits the theme of this movie so well. Shinkai and Tenmon makes a great team.<br />
<br />
Character: Don&#039;t be fooled by the score. The characters in this movie are great but everything else is the cause. Takaki, Akari, and the others don&#039;t have the appeal like other characters do but the story-telling is done so well that you will get attached. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is, without a doubt, Shinkai&#039;s best work. He keeps getting better and better. I am so looking forward to his next work.<br />
<br />

    This movie made me want to hunt down some cherry trees and find out whether petals really do fall at five centimeters a second. Who figures this stuff out?<br />
<br />
STORY - It&#039;s simple and quaint. It&#039;s a story about time and distance that most people could probably relate to on some level. It&#039;s cute and poignant, but I did feel that it was a little over-dramatic. The movie is split into three segments set years apart, though there are several flashbacks sequences contained within each segment. As a result, the storytelling felt a bit choppy -- especially in the first segment, I had a really hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10322">
        time figuring out just how much time had passed between the characters meeting and the characters parting. And when I did figure it out... six months isn&#039;t that long, guys. Get over it. Letter writing is cute, but I have to wonder whether they had cell phones or email. Drifting can be avoided if you try hard enough.<br />
<br />
Okay, so drifting because of distance is an inevitable occurrence for a lot of people. I can definitely relate to that, and I can definitely understand that, but it felt a little contrived for such strong feelings to be affecting elementary-age students and even middle school-age students. Nostalgia comes much later than that. The finality of departure doesn&#039;t hit home as you&#039;re saying goodbye; it comes much, much later. (And again, I feel like I can say this because I&#039;ve been through it.) Maybe 5 Centimeters per Second is supposed to illustrate the most severe scenario, but I think it would have been a bit more believable if the story hadn&#039;t started them so young. <br />
<br />
Still, if that&#039;s my only complaint, then I guess it isn&#039;t much. The themes of the movie are powerful, and the storytelling is very effective in helping to convey the message. It&#039;s very bittersweet.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS - Most of the characters were just a tad on the obsessive side, and they all thought on too high and deep a level for their age. I think it would have helped the audience relate to them more if they had been a little less serious, a little more playful, and had a little less tunnel-vision, but for a short movie, I guess a narrow focus on the themes at hand was important. Akari was probably the most normal character, but Takaki and Kanae were almost to the point where I wouldn&#039;t have been surprised if someone had recommended them psychological counsel. (Also, what&#039;s up with these characters&#039; parents? Who lets their elementary-age kid take a train four or five hours away, alone, during a blizzard?)<br />
<br />
Realism points are a little lacking, but I don&#039;t really think individual personalities were all that important to the overall movie. The story&#039;s focus was time and distance, so it&#039;s beneficial for the characters to be more generic and anonymous. That allows the viewer to project whatever personal feelings they have on the subject onto the characters. 5 Centimeters per Second feels like a pretty personal piece in general -- every viewer walks away from it with something different, depending on their own experiences. <br />
<br />
ARTSTYLE &amp;amp; ANIMATION - The art in this movie is ridiculous. It was so beautiful, I had a terrible time remembering to read subtitles, though I almost think that if I had seen this dubbed, I would have forgotten to pay attention to the dialogue anyway. It was just that mesmerizing. Every little detail you could possibly imagine -- it was there. The labels on soft drinks, the posters on the walls, the reflections on desks, the dew on leaves, the dappled sunlight under trees, the inscriptions on subway turnstiles! I always wonder whether background artists are bitter that their grand masterpieces are only shown for all of a second in most cases. I wanted to keep pausing to stare at the details. And the clouds. Oh, god, the clouds, the sky. I could have watched those skies forever. It was actually really disorienting to see such epic skies because they were too amazing to be realistic, and my brother was making jokes about whether or not such skies existed only in Japan because we sure as hell have never seen anything that breathtaking over here! Still, the grandeur nature of the skies really helped to illustrate distance and isolation. If the scoring for the art is based on the backgrounds alone, I&#039;d give it an 11.<br />
<br />
The characters are strikingly plain against such incredible backgrounds, but that&#039;s not a surprise. There is nothing particularly notable about any of them, which works well enough -- they&#039;re anonymous people in a way. Their story could be anyone&#039;s. Still, there are some inconsistencies in the character design that&#039;s worth noting. Especially for Kanae of the second &amp;quot;episode,&amp;quot; it seemed like her relative age changed in every scene because her proportions would be different and her face would be slightly off. In her school uniform, she looked thirteen. In her bathing suit, she looked seventeen or older. I can deal with simple character designs against backgrounds of such amazing caliber, but come on. <br />
<br />
MUSIC - There&#039;s pretty minimal music for most of this movie, which makes many of its scenes all the more thoughtful and poignant. Most of the time, there are only soft piano tunes creeping in quietly behind the dialogue, which is really nice. Unfortunately, the movie ends with the most obnoxious and random song imaginable. Okay, actually, the song isn&#039;t actually that bad, but the fact is that its beat, tempo, and general mood clash horribly with everything in the movie. The montage of scenes it accompanies would have done just immeasurably better with the piano from the rest of the film, or even silence or sound effects, but no. We get a random pop song that doesn&#039;t fit. Do not want.<br />
<br />
VOICE ACTING - Saw this subbed, and all the voices felt pretty plain and generic, but nothing really sophisticated was required anyway. I think it would have been hard to do a bad job with this. It&#039;s almost all introspection, and the voices were appropriately thoughtful, so that&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
OVERALL - Despite the fact that the subject and themes of 5 Centimeters per Second are actually pretty relevant to me, a lot of things distracted me from the main point. The art was arguably too beautiful, and all the little inconsistencies and lack of realism in the characters bothered me more than it probably should have. Honestly though, it&#039;s a really nice and concise story, and I&#039;d definitely say that this movie is worth sacrificing an hour of your life for. As a final note, I think it&#039;s worth mentioning that I really like the name of this film. Depending on your perspective, that speed can seem too slow or too fast for falling cherry blossoms. It&#039;s a distant metaphor, but it&#039;s a fitting one.

    How bittersweet it is, the distance that exists between human beings.  It is a theme tackled by artists and authors across the centuries, and it is the topic of Makoto Shinkai&#039;s brilliantly crafted work, 5 Centimetres Per Second.  Shinkai addresses the fundamental questions of human interaction: how do we achieve it? how do we lose it? and why do we long for it?  His method in doing so crafts a beautiful tale of childhood love, of growth and separation, and of human dreams and desires into the future.<br />

Broken down into three parts, 5 Centimetres Per Second presents the evolution of Takaki T&amp;Atilde;�&amp;iuml;&amp;iquest;&amp;frac12;no,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1052">
        as he grows through his early teenage years into adulthood.  With him is his childhood friend and love, Akari Shinohara.  In breaking the story down, Shinkai achieves a masterful generalization of the the process of growing apart, first through the idealistic lens of a child, to the yearning pathos of a teenager, and finally to the reality of life as an adult.  The stories are told in a way such that all viewers can easily see the evolution and growth of humanity&#039;s outlook on the development process, while still retaining the human touch of a story, rather than sounding like a dissertation.  From this, it is the story that is the true masterpiece of 5 Centimetres Per Second - without it, the themes of the piece are merely abstract concepts without a human face.  The emphasis is clearly on the lives of the individual characters, and the events that, while out of our direct control, are constantly pressuring our existence down a specific path, perhaps one that we do not wish to follow.  While the movie treats the gap of human interaction as a sadness endemic to the human condition, it also ends on a positive note of humanity&#039;s constant desire to reach out to those around us, encapsulated beautifully in the metaphor emphasized in the second part.<br />
<br />
From a technical perspective, the animation qualities of 5 Centimetres Per Second eclipse previous animes that I have seen by a long-shot.  The backdrops are absolutely stunning, with a fluid of motion between frames that make it look less like an animated feature on a screen and more like the motion of objects directly in front of us.  Juxtaposed with this is the quality of the hand-drawn characters, who, despite being obviously of a different animation style, still melds in perfectly with the environment around them.  What results is that it appears that the world is actually crafted for the characters - a living, breathing world that will continue to exist even after we turn off the screen, ongoing in its artistic eternity.<br />
<br />
My recommendation?  Watch this movie - it is the epitome of what is achievable in art.  It is a must see for anyone who desires a deeper, richer experience from the stories that they encounter.

    Genuine love is indubitably an experience that everyone puts sincere consideration towards or conceivably aspires to procure. Unfortunately as this film judiciously portrays, maintaining such an exacting and frail relationship is a daunting challenge to confront indeed. This is especially accurate and undoubtedly concrete for a couple dauntlessly trudging through the painstaking and exacting endeavor known as maturity. <br />
<br />
The fundamental plot itself covers a vast, almost tremendous duration of time ranging from the protagonists childhood to adulthood. One would expediently deem that such a broad time scale couldn’t be utilized properly within a mere hour long film. Fortunately no such apprehension or skepticism is required,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review94971">
        the story neither sacrifices nor renounces crucial plot elements whatsoever. The romance is both passionate and compelling, yet phenomenally extensive with a well executed, subtle and nonchalant ambiance. <br />
<br />
Story: In the beginning we are introduced to two elementary students residing in Tokyo, Takaki and Akari, who have held an enduring bond of friendship till recently. However subsequent graduation Akari moved and was forced to part ways with Takaki. Throughout the next seven long years, they desperately strived to maintain their fragile relationship. After discerning the dreadful news that Akira would be unwillingly moving again, significantly further away he felt resolute to reconcile their dismantling bond, while the opportunity was still attainable. They successfully meet after 7 years and reconcile and eagerly advance the bond to a romantic level understandably, yet much to their dismay this will be their final encounter.<br />
<br />
As time relentlessly passes Takaki has become astray, surmising life itself to be trivial and null. The present is insignificant to him, constantly pondering and dwelling obsessively over the past with great resolve. Meanwhile Takakis senior high classmate Kanae has carried an enduring love for him and is wholly cognizant of his internal strife. However despite her determination, yearning and avidity to alleviate him of his despondency with embrace, she realizes her aspirations are futile and fruitless. Astoundingly our protagonist has become a mature sophisticated businessman, yet is more dismal than ever, now cynical and misanthropic to everything residing in his surroundings. Now unemployed and by an extraordinary not to mention bizarre twist of chance Takaki irrevocably accepts the notion to relinquish all of his past and look towards the prospective future.<br />
<br />
Characters: Incontestably one can’t execute a romance film without them so it’s indubitably where Byousoku compromises its true dignity and virtue. The individual protagonists themselves ostensibly and forthright seem to all carry dearth and deficient personalities along with subtle reactions to dramatic phenomenon and events. However there is absolutely no exigent urgency for concern, since this outlandish characterization style was applied in this manner for a legitimate reason on which it executed eminently as well as prudently. <br />
<br />
This outlandish characterization style has been utilized in director Shinkai Mokotos past works as well. The intendment and purpose behind this is to depict them as not mere characters, but genuine authentic people with drastically differing traits. Another predominant purpose was to abstain from overdramatizing. The voice acting too was utilized along the same premise and was executed fantastically. <br />
<br />
Visuals: I was overwhelmed by the breathtaking and awe-inspiring quality of the lighting effects put into Byousoku, and this film is 6 years old. It’s the most stunning lighting I’ve undoubtedly ever seen. Landscape effects were vibrant and very dynamic, movement animations emanated an engaging surreal ambiance. Characters designs wistfully were a bit bland and slightly monotonous, though not enough to criticize and denounce over. At least they contravene typical cliché designs and styles. <br />
<br />
Sound: The environmental sound effects were flawless and authentic. In addition nothing sounded duplicated from somewhere else, everything likely was original and designed for Byousoku. Whether it be the abundant variety of elegant yet subtle classical style background music or passionate yet powerful ending song, they all were executed superbly.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I’d never imagined that a romance film could present itself in such a systematic and uniform manner yet simultaneously retain its vital sentimentality. It’s incredibly ironic how Byousoku is the most unemotional and reserved romance anime I’ve ever watched yet it’s certainly the most passionate, sentimental, and gratifying I’ve seen to date. Though, as much as I detest criticizing, there are issues with the conclusion, albeit a minute amount. The issues particularly pertaining to Takaki and how attains his life altering revelation, it’s rather erratic, perhaps too erratic. In addition it’s dubious and incogitable based on the sequence of events that transpired up that point. Overall, Byousoku can still proudly stand firm as a very admirable, innovative and distinguished romance film that’s magnificent to look at.<br />
<br />

    This is a story of &quot;boy meets girl&quot;, and then nothing else happens. <br />
<br />
Now before I begin my thoughts, I&#039;d like to say that I am a sucker for the anime romance genre. I went in this movie with high expectations, and came out watching one drab, albeit beautifully illustrated animated film.<br />
<br />
Byousoku 5 Centimeter had a promising beginning.  There is a very touching scene during the (seemingly) fated encounter of the main characters. Unfortunately there is no more enjoyment to extract after this. The rest of the movie consists of observing the inability of the male lead to get over his first love. At

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112659">
        this point it becomes completely mundane, watching the mc twiddle his thumbs and waste his life wishing he did not have to grow up and apart from his one-time sweetheart. Realistic? Perhaps, but a part of realism that I want to get away from when I watch a film to begin with.<br />
<br />
Sure, Byousoku 5 Centimeter is pretty, yet it is dull and unflattering in the story department... at least past the beginning.

     I will try keep this short, understandable, and not too long for some viewers who just want to know a short opinion about the anime, and not a detailed essay (no offence intended to other reviewers)<br />
<br />
STORY: <br />
The main theme in 5cm is distant love; the story in 5cm is typical in most animes. However, Shinkai Makoto has not only created something with deeper meaning but has also transformed how we watch anime.<br />
The story is divided into three arcs, each telling a different story at a different time. The story mainly revolves around a boy/man name Takaki and his long time childhood friend, Akira. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1663">
        story is beautiful, with a great ending. <br />
<br />
ART:<br />
What can I say?  Shinkai Makoto has done it again! The art in 5cm isn&#039;t just intruding, but it is also realistic. From the flickering reflections in the train to the detailed buildings and characters. The art just blends in with the story beautifully, just seeing the art just makes me want to watch this over and over again.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The music in 5cm perfectly blends in with the atmosphere of the anime, you feel as if you are in the movie. The music somehow manages to smoothly merge the viewer and the anime together. The sound effects fulfills its purpose by providing realistic sounds such as the perfectly executed train noises. Although the music does not play a major role in the first two episodes, the ending music is just amazing; it really makes you synthesis for the characters.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
As you continue to watch 5cm, you are immediately drawn into the characters, as mentioned above; the story is divided into three arcs. One in his childhood days, one in his high school days and the last in his adulthood days. Each arc all contain the main character, Takaki and as the story continues characters revolve around him. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
Although I have only watched this once, it has already left an impact on me. The art, sound and the overall story pulled me into the movie. I really enjoyed this movie to a point that I wrote a review on it. ^^ <br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Shinkai Makoto has not only created a movie with outstanding art and music but also combined the elements of Romance and Drama into one heck of a movie. <br />

    Byousoku 5cm (5cm per Second) is the latest creation by Makoto Shinkai, whom many consider to be the next Hiyao Miyazaki.  That’s a big name to live up, but it seems like he’s living up to his reputation.  Previously, Shinkai has been animating, voicing and editing all of his animations either by himself or with a few other people…nonetheless all of this previous works are underappreciated master pieces.  Byousoku 5cm is his first full production anime…and wow, this is his best anime yet and blows most animes away in almost every aspect.<br />
<br />
*warning slight spoilers*<br />
<br />
This anime is actually a 3 part movie, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23726">
        each part concentrating on different times of the characters’ lives.  In part one “Okasho” we are introduced to the two young protagonists, Takaki and Akari and get to see how their friendship develops into love and then see how cruel life can be by splitting them apart.  The bond that forms between them isn’t forced, but is subtle yet extremely powerful.  Not many animes can portray a relationship as moving and touching as shown here.  This first part depicts the joy, happiness yet naiveté and struggle of young first love.  As more and more obstacles get in between these two love struck couples, we really get a sense of and are able to relate to what they are going through.  Their inability to actually confess their love for each other, and whether even declaring their love would bring them closer is shown through Shinkai’s use of distance, both in the physical and emotional sense.  <br />
<br />
Distance as well as silence is a huge theme in this anime.  Physical distance of being apart is shown intensely in scenes like when Takaki treks through a blizzard to get to Akari.  Going on this journey with him, as his train gets delayed or even cancelled, is heart wrenching to say the least.  Will he make it?  Will Akari still be there even if he does get there?  Not only does this scene portray physical distance, but it delves into the emotional distance between Takaki and Akari.  The diminishing frequency of letters sent to each other or the silence between them once they meet strengthens this point. The letters that they send eachother also reflect this distance and the change that is occurring in their relationship.  They talk about how the seasons change and how their routine/friends have changed in the letters…and this also strikes painfully how vast the distance between them actually is.  Silence is another huge emotion evoking element used in this anime.  The dialogues are simple, yet overarching and powerfully felt.  There is minimal use of music, and there are scenes where you are just drawn into the scene unfolding with nothing but silence.  This is brilliant, because emotions can be felt clearly through the characters actions and expressions.  When you can understand what the characters are going through, even when there is no dialogue, that is the pinnacle of great character development.   And sometimes you don’t need to say anything to show love between two people.  However, there is a flip side to the silence which Shinkai explores.  These two young characters never truly confessed their love for eachother in words, and then left Takaki wondering “what if?” for the duration of the anime.  Perhaps sometimes it’s best to just out right say what you’re feeling…but would the confession have brought them any closer or distanced them further?<br />
<br />
The 2nd part is called Cosmonaut and further explores the theme of distance and develops further Takaki as well as a new character named Kanae.  Here we have changed the love story from the exciting first love to a more bitter love.  Distance is further represented through Takaki’s dream which he constantly has about Akari.  They are so close to each other in his dream, yet so far as to a point where he can’t even imagine her face.  The cosmic reference is used to say how beautiful yet far, remote and unexplored love can be.  This part can be described by the quote used in this anime, “to absolutely and wholeheartedly believe that somewhere in the abyss, you are getting closer to the secrets of the universe.”  Takaki is still dreaming of the “what could have been” while Kanae is trying to get closer to Takaki but noticing that Takaki is in a far off place, unreachable by Kanae.  Again silence comes into play here as well.  Takaki’s silence towards Akari, by never being able to send her letter or even text messages…Akari never being able to declare her feeling towards Takaki; the silence shown in these scenes are again potent to say the least.  <br />
<br />
The 3rd part is called “Byousoku 5cm” or “5cm per Second” and here we are exploring the more mature yet ever changing relationships between people.  5cm per second or the falling of the sakura reflects the fleeting beauty in our relationship and lives.  Was their meeting and love destined to happen?  Was their love or there lack of determined by fate?  Both sides of the coin are explored even more in this chapter and shows how if there is fate, that it can be both beautiful and cruel.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, you can get a sense of how deep the characters truly are in this anime.  They are drawn simply, and many of the scenes are enveloped in silence.  But the development that occurs in all the characters is truly remarkable and relatable.  The characters are simple yet not the stereotypical anime characters.  You would be hard pressed to find any other anime which develops the characters like this anime does.  Anime is notorious for using over expression in their characters to get their points and feeling across.  Not so in this anime…none of the growth, emotions, actions seem forced, but are natural and relatable.  The music, like I said before is simple as well, but definitely fits the mood when it comes into play.  The theme “One More Time” is heart wrenching and wraps up the sentiment of the anime very well.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation quality…OMG this is hands down the most gorgeous anime I have ever seen.  Everything is detailed to the very minute and the scenes created cast the perfect mood for the viewers.  Nothing seems out of place or artificial.  The bitter sweetness of this anime comes across as realistic as can be because of the superb animation quality.  Voice acting is top notch as well.  In such a character driven anime, excellent voice acting is required to get the point across and feel what the characters are feeling.  And in this regard, this anime does not disappoint.  The subtle nuances in the characters’ speech can be heard to pull you into the story and atmosphere.  <br />
<br />
An overshadowed master piece, this anime is a must watch for all, whether you are an action, drama, or comedy fan.  Hell even non-anime watchers will appreciate what this anime does.  A superb masterpiece from a director named the next Miyazaki.  <br />

    “A mighty pain to love it is,<br />
And &#039;tis a pain that pain to miss;<br />
But of all pains, the greatest pain<br />
It is to love, but love in vain.” <br />
― Abraham Cowley<br />
<br />
People say that out of all of the romantic relationships you have in life, your first love is the most impactful. Everyone can remember their first love. How sweet it was, and how painful it was when it ended. Director, Makoto Shinkai, decided stray away from the fantasy elements that were common in his previous films and aimed to create a film depicting how cruel reality can be. The cruelty of unrequited love. The end result

          <span style="display: none;" id="review126253">
        is one of the most breathtaking, heartbreaking and beautiful depictions of romance in the medium.<br />
<br />
Story(9/10)- The movie follows a pair of young lovers, Takaki and Akari as they grow up and take different paths throughout life. It is divided into three chapters, the first being,  &quot;Cherry Blossoms,&quot; which revolves around Takaki and Akari&#039;s relationship as children. The second act,  &quot;Cosmonaut,&quot; is told from the perspective of a girl who has a crush on Takaki. The Final act is called,&quot;5 Centimeters Per Second,&quot; which shows Takaki and Akari as adults.<br />
<br />
Going into this film you can expect one thing, heartbreak. The anime shows us how time can cause feelings to fade. How unaware we are of other&#039;s feelings when we ourselves are in love. And how not all love will be realized. Using symbolism as well as metaphor, Shinkai Makoto masterfully shows how distance can put a strain on feelings. Even though we may be physically close to someone, they can really be so far away. He doesn&#039;t rely on tears, or screaming scenes to convey emotion, Shinkai relies on subtly and nuance. He keeps the movie down to earth without being melodramatic or cliche. <br />
<br />
Art(10/10)- The film is honestly worth watching for the animation alone. It is nothing short of fantastic. The lighting is phenomenal, every scene is hand drawn with meticulous detail. The animations are fluid and crisp. <br />
<br />
Sound(10/10)- The sound direction for this film is superb. The background tracks are never loud or overly dramatic, the accent each scene perfectly creating a much more emotional experience. This has to be one of the finest soundtracks in anime bar none.<br />
<br />
Character(8/10)- Although we don&#039;t get an in-depth look into the lives of each character, they all come across as relatable. Takaki and Akari&#039;s relationship never comes off as saccharine like most romances in anime, it comes off as human. You see couples like them just walking in the park. And not only is their relationship realistic, but also their feelings. Anybody who has been in love can surely empathize with their feelings.<br />
<br />
5 Centimeters Per Second is a phenomenal film that truly depicts the heartbreak of being relationship where love will never be reciprocated. It shows that although feelings will wane over time, one will never forget their first love. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who likes romance.

    I feel like I’m the odd one out of the crowd. Everybody kept telling me what a dime this movie was so I got pretty stoked to see it. So how did this movie end up boring me so much? I consider myself fairly generous when it comes to dishing out ratings, so how did this anime end up being the lowest rated anime I’ve given thus far? <br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
Yes, I gave the story a 5/10. People are probably already crying out heresy by telling me, “Well, you didn’t like the story because you didn’t get the message!” No, I understood the overarching theme. In

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226878">
        fact, I give mad props for such an ending. I honestly didn’t expect things to wrap up so maturely. Time will keep moving forward. People move on. Their outlooks changes. Childhood promises and dreams are often times left behind. We can’t always expect fairly tale endings, and I absolutely love the parallels to the harsh world of reality here. It was a nice slap in the face and a refreshing break from the lovey-dovey endings I’ve seen in other romance anime. Honestly, the moral of the story is what carries the story of this movie.<br />
<br />
So why did I give the story such a low score? Since the moral was so good, I should have given this at least a 7, right? Well, here’s the thing. Yes, the theme is all well and dandy, and yes, things wrapped up fairly well, and yes, there are hidden specs of foreshadowing that reveals the theme bit by bit, but the execution of everything building up to that goal was just so stale that it almost negated the purpose of the movie. It is entirely possible to have a deep theme AND a solid execution. This anime just doesn’t do that. <br />
<br />
The first chapter was okay-ish I guess, although I was already borderline bored at certain times. The second chapter was insanely weak. Introducing a boring new character with a so-so purpose only to have her serve as a mere plot device and then dropping her 20 minutes later is not going to impress me, sorry. Third chapter could have amounted to something if it wasn’t so quick. The third chapter was like 11 minutes total. The last 4 minutes of those 11 were a montage. So essentially, 7 minutes of actual content. <br />
<br />
I just want to reiterate it one last time. The story wasn&#039;t mediocre because it wasn&#039;t &quot;mature&quot; enough. It wasn&#039;t boring because it wasn&#039;t filled to the brim with plot twists. The problem here was that the road building up to that mature ending was just so stale that I almost ceased to care.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2/10<br />
<br />
Probably the lowest score I have ever given in any category. Two main characters, Takaki and Akari - both as bland as a cardboard box. Easily the most uninteresting characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Forget about the supporting cast as they are even worse than the main characters. MyAnimeList says this anime has 5 characters for its cast. So what we basically have is a total of 5 characters - 3 of which are bland and boring and 2 of which are nearly irrelevant. Are you really surprised by my score?<br />
<br />
Do I sound unfair? I don’t think I do. I have defended my share of characters who are deemed somewhat bland. Nagisa from Clannad is sometimes depicted by people to be a generic, stereotypical cutsey girl, yet I’ve defended her. Ganta from Deadman Wonderland is depicted as a weak, uninteresting crybaby, yet I’ve defended him. Suzaku from Code Geass is constantly perceived as a hypocritical, preachy nut who kept getting in Lelouch&#039;s way, yet I&#039;ve defended him. I&#039;ve even defended Sakura Haruno from Naruto. Trust me, I would not bash on the MC of 5 Centimeters Per Second unless they deserved it, and it is my judgement that they do. <br />
<br />
How did they bore me to the point of literal tears? I never thought anime characters could be so stale that I’d have to yawn in frustration every 5 consecutive minutes. I wish I was exaggerating, but unfortunately I’m not. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
The best thing about this movie by far. I was flabbergasted to know that this was a 2007 movie since the artwork was simply jawdropping at times. I can’t even say that I’m exaggerating. Some scenes like the rocket launch were just so beautiful that it almost hurt to give this anime such a low score. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Soundtrack was fitting for the type of mood this movie was trying to convey. Delicate, light music constantly blessed my ears. In conjunction with the superb art, the music can help create quite a spectacle. <br />
<br />
So why did I score this a 7/10? Because the voice acting was so dull for me. As you’ve already seen above, the cast of characters are already insanely bland in terms of script and dialogue. The voice acting does nothing to help that fact. <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
What did you expect from me here? Weak execution of the story (minus the moral and ending), absolute trash characters, and completely uninspired voice acting with only the amazing artwork and the above average soundtrack to hold it up. Did you expect any less from me?<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
<br />
+ Jawdropping artwork. Absolutely gorgeous at times. <br />
+ Music successfully conveyed the tone of the movie (wasn’t legendary though). <br />
+ Mature resolution that I did not expect.<br />
+ A deep, overarching theme that covers the entire movie that you’ll probably come to realize after you finish watching the movie. <br />
<br />
- Poor execution of the story, despite its strong desire to convey a meaningful theme. My yawn count was astronomically high. <br />
- Some of the most bland characters I’ve ever witnessed, and this is coming from somebody who would often times defend the so-called “weak” characters. <br />
- Voice acting sounds unmotivated and only serves to detract from the already garbage characters. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
I really wanted to like this movie. Trust me, I really did. I saw the genius in its potential and reveled in the hype. It brings me no pleasure to say that what I got instead was one of the biggest letdowns I’ve ever had to suffer in all of my anime experience. I am honestly baffled that this anime has such a good reputation. I know, subjective opinions and all. To be honest, I’m even more surprised that all of my scores ended up averaging to a total of 5/10. I expected way less. Anyways, if you really want to try this movie, then go ahead. Chances are you&#039;ll like it since everybody but me seems to adore this movie. However, if you’re anything like me, you’ll most likely walk away really disappointed. If that’s the case, leave now and save your time for another anime.

    When I first saw Makoto Shinkai&#039;s 5 Centimeters Per Second, I sat in shock and dismay as the movie ended. I felt an uncomfortable churn in my gut. All I could do was ask: was that it!? I quickly did a search on the internet to see if I was &quot;missing&quot; something about the films ending, and of course I found a ton of other people also upset about how the film ended as well. The problem however was not with the film, but myself. At the time, I didn&#039;t understand what Shinkai&#039;s art was about, or what 5 Centimeters Per Second was trying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187298">
        achieve. Hell, I actually went into the film, with the expectation of a traditional narrative, and even saw the film as a typical &quot;romance&quot; plot. <br />
<br />
Shinkai&#039;s work first and foremost, is about capturing a &quot;feeling&quot; and &quot;emotion&quot;. He&#039;s a unique artist, in that instead of focusing on character driven narrative, he uses his visual art to try to capture and evoke an emotion that people are familiar with, but that isn&#039;t often contextualized or visualized. With 5 Centimeter Per Second, it&#039;s about the hurt and pain we feel, when relationships are eroded over time and distance. It&#039;s about how time, distance, and things beyond our control can change even the most intimate and important connections we might have with another person. And the desperation and loneliness we can feel as a result of it.  And the film does this brilliantly by having a three act structure. It&#039;s three points in the life of a person, and how in each point this person copes with his relationship with someone important fading over time. The loneliness, and the yearning, and how not even distance can stop those feelings. <br />
<br />
In 5 Centimeters Per Second, the characters aren&#039;t as well defined as characters are in traditional narrative. Because in a way, they act as a vessel with which the audience puts themselves directly into (like how some video games have a silent protagonist). The first act quickly sets up the premise that will drive the film, showing two characters connecting on an intimate level at a young age, and then being pulled apart when one of them has to move far away because of their parents work. Shinkai utilizes a three act structure, with each act serving as a unique outlet to express the emotions he is trying to capture in this film. For instance in Act 1, Shinkai uses the protagonist getting on a train and travelling to the girl that moved away, as a narrative device to physically visualize the hurdles that distance can have on a relationship, and the desperation one can feel wanting so badly to reach that other person (regardless of the distance). It&#039;s a very intense sequence. Every minute that passes, you can feel the uneasiness and desperation the protagonist feels.  And as each minute continues to pass, you can almost feel the emotions bubbling to the surface and ready to burst out. It&#039;s the emotional equivalence of desperately swimming to the top of a body of water and feeling like you are running out of time and breath. It&#039;s the desperate gasp of breath you need as you are about to reach that surface. The protagonist deals with train delays (because of the snow), and as time begins to pass, there is a sense that, it&#039;s too late. That the girl won&#039;t be there, because it&#039;s far past the time he was supposed to arrive. It feels like fate is trying to keep him apart.  This entire act is masterfully done, and is an example of how an artist, can really evoke tension and fear, without needing the use of action or common tropes. We instead get a simple train ride, and that&#039;s enough to bring out all the tension and desperation we are meant to feel.<br />
<br />
In Act 2, Shinkai does something different and unique, by shifting the perspective of the story, to another character that is NOT the protagonist. Or rather, it&#039;s seeing the protagonist through the eyes of someone else. When I first saw the film, I wasn&#039;t entirely sure how I felt about it. But upon re-watching it, I realized how powerful and smart Act 2 really is from a creative perspective. After all, the theme of this film is how distance can keep our feelings and the connection we have to another person apart. And whereas the protagonist&#039;s distance is a physical distance, here the side character faces an &quot;emotional distance&quot;. The protagonist is so wrapped up in his feelings for the girl he met as a child, that no matter how close the side character gets to him, the experiences they have, or if she gets the courage to eventually express her feelings, she realizes she can never reach the protagonist. Shinkai truly capture the ache and pain we can feel, when we so desperately want someone to connect with our feelings, and the moment we accept it can&#039;t ever be. I&#039;ve seen a lot of romance anime, and I&#039;ve never seen something that is able to capture these emotions as well as 5 Centimeters Per Second does.<br />
<br />
Act 3 is where I think a lot of people have mixed emotions about it. Because Shinkai decides to take a realistic approach to the romance narrative, instead of giving way to the &quot;fantasy&quot; aspect that most romance narratives have. It&#039;s a &quot;life moves on&quot; kind of plot device. As people get older, they change. The further the distance and time, the more our past relationships start to fade, and new ones eventually take their place. This act likes to examine &quot;nostalgia&#039;, and someone not being able to let go of the past. It looks at the expectations we have for life, and how they don&#039;t always play out the way we wanted it to. It&#039;s pretty damn depressing. Even more so, when you take it into context of all the arcs, and start to connect each one to the very end. For instance, I can&#039;t help but go back to Act 2, and think about how desperately our side character was in love with the protagonist. And how she wasn&#039;t ever able to reach him on an emotional level. And here we have the protagonist years later, and he hasn&#039;t moved on. And then it just kind of hits you. You realize how, precious and fragile relationships can be. How, no matter how important and intimate our connections with another person is, those things can be eroded or destroyed by time and distance. And if we aren&#039;t able to move on and be open to new relationships and connections, we can become controlled and destroyed by these very same connections (as the world moves on). Shinkai using a romance plot to hang this theme on, makes it all the more painful. <br />
<br />
5 Centimeters Per Second isn&#039;t really a linear narrative. So the ending really is up to the interpretation of the viewer. It&#039;s really about what you personally take away from it. When I initially saw it, I felt sick to my stomach. And I didn&#039;t really know why. Upon re-watching it, I was still left with those feelings. However, I knew what they were. I knew exactly why I felt that way. Shinkai achieved what he set out to do. He visually and physically contextualized emotions and feelings that we often, bury or just accept, but don&#039;t think about. And this film makes you confront them face on. It made me think about all the relationships that meant so much to me, and how time, distance, and just life in general, eventually made those relationships fade away. It made me wonder if those personal connections we have with others, really mean something in the grand scheme of things. And there is something to ponder about, when you realize that apart of life, is these wonderful connections and relationships fading, and being replaced by new ones. And while this is certainly nothing new to life in general (this idea of the old making way for the new), there is something much more painful about this when it&#039;s human connection, feelings, memories and relationships that in this flux and cycle of being extinct and being replaced. <br />
<br />
Visually, the film is stunning. It has some of the best art style I&#039;ve seen in any animation. Shinkai has a real gift for capturing lighting, as well the beauty of nature. There are several sequences where it&#039;s about intimacy between two people, and Shinkai&#039;s visuals create this private world for them. All of this is paired off with an incredible score by Tenmon. Amd it all comes together to make an truly unique and beautiful experience. There were times in the film, where the art and music were so beautifully paired, I got knots in my stomach, and I could feel my gut churning. It&#039;s not often a film can move you emotionally the way 5 Centimeters Per Second does. It&#039;s very much a visual film, in that it&#039;s purpose is to really capture and make you feel the emotions that he is setting out to contextualize. Don&#039;t go intro this film expecting a linear narrative, that will have a lot of resolution. Because ultimately, this is about expressing the feelings through the main character, and that is what it does by the end.<br />

    I discovered this work of Shinkai&#039;s after being impressed by his latest film, Kotonoha no Niwa. Sadly, I was rather disappointed by this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know? The speed at which cherry blossoms fall...five centimeters per second&quot; is probably the film defining quote.<br />
<br />
 Perhaps it was Shinkai&#039;s intention to make the viewer feel this slow passage of time through the incredibly, incredibly slow progression of events in the film. This movie was terribly paced to the point where it was unbearable.<br />
<br />
The beginning was set up well, but the middle was just a long and aggravatingly drawn out depiction of scenes that honestly contributed nothing to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review142627">
        plot. One would think that sitting through the full length of this movie would merit a well thought out ending, but the ending was just as frustrating as the rest of the film. <br />
<br />
The characters, especially Takaki, are not very well developed. They are quite flat. Takaki is the Hamlet of the movie, constantly brooding, melancholy, and very prone to inaction. He does nothing but feel sorry for himself. Akari is the typical anime girl. What else is there to say? Disappointing.<br />
<br />
The scenery was very nice. The character art was not. There was a very stark contrast between the quality of the background and that of the characters. It was very strange and the amount of work that was put into developing the realism of the scenery made the lack of work put into the character art more apparent.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think many people overrate this simply based on the good quality of the animation and a tendency to be drawn to easily relatable themes like two people slowly drifting apart, long distance relationships, and that whole love stuff.

    Five Centimeters Per Second is the most boring masterpiece of the anime medium. It lacks climax, action, and even a proper conclusion, yet portrays the theme of distance in the best possible way with breathtaking art and delightful sound. It&#039;s the kind of movie where the audience won&#039;t necessarily cry but rather feel heartbroken or bitter for extended period of time. <br />
<br />
Distance is a culprit that separates people. Distance, not necessarily the space between people but the distance between their heart, and the distance between their memories. It just sad thinking the person you love today will be somewhere else tomorrow, living life completely differently,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181985">
        moving on without a single trace of your influence. Yet knowing all of this, Takaki and Akari tries to overcome the growing distance of their hearts, memories, and their interests. Knowing that Takaki will perhaps never love her, never look at her, Sumida keeps trying to reach Takaki&#039;s walled heart. <br />
<br />
Yes, that&#039;s is all there is to Five Centimeters Per Second. A boring romantic tragedy of three teenagers whose love interest drifts away by the order of time and space. They are by no means star crossed nor there is anything stopping them from loving each other. Yet, these characters try to cope with everyday life, slowly moving away from each other, at an metaphorical distance of five centimeters per second. Yet, these few centimeters, after few years, become thousands of kilometers. These lovers who once shared so much in common, after few years, are strangers on different paths. <br />
<br />
The characters are plain, dull, and just average. They don&#039;t develop by the end of the movie and there is nothing special about them. They are average people, trying to love and live and flow with the rest of society. They are perfect for the tale Shinkai tries to tell: the influence of distance in commoners. Not ninjas, pirates, policemen or samurai, but the influence of distance, society, and life on common, average people. <br />
<br />
This movie is also one of the best animated movie ever produced. The scenes are heavily detailed and carefully colored. From trains to cityscape to rural roads, the art is just breathtaking. It is also important to note that the art is drawn with an extra shade of pink and purple, to maintain the symbol of cherry blossom. To put it simply, almost all frames of this movie can be a wallpaper. <br />
<br />
The soundtracks are another aspect of beauty in the movie. The tone of the movie is set well by the soundtracks. The tracks also contain great variety, ranging from something as jolly as Poem of Sea and Sky to something as heartbreaking as The Feeling that Doesn&#039;t Reach. Tenmon has done outstanding job with the tunes. The character voices are very gentle and simply, average.  <br />
<br />
Overall, the portrayal of distance along with abundance of symbolism is what makes the story of Five Centimeters Per Second wonderful. It seems like an ordinary tale yet it stands for something much bigger. Makoto Shinkai doesn&#039;t try to fight the morals of society like Ghibli films, Cowboy Bebop, or some other big shot anime titles. But Shinkai does the best job at portraying what Five Cenitmeters Per Second is: a realistic, romantic fiction. Shinkai doesn&#039;t write it to provide pleasure or happiness but tells the story maturely and honestly. And that is why this movie can be considered a masterpiece, for portraying the average life in the most average, boring, and realistic way possible while highlighting great lessons.  <br />
<br />
So if anyone wants to experience exquisite artwork, delightful soundtracks, and a boring yet wonderful, mature story of hopeless love, this is a great use of 59 minutes. Understand that the ending is very subjective and open ended.

    I have attempted to accurately describe why I dislike this anime, and I have failed momentously on every occasion (I may have even failed this time around). Some may call this lazy, but I find it suitable for the situation. In the portion of this review dedicated to addressing story and characters, I will compare 5 Centimeters Per Second to a literary work considered to be one of the greatest gothic novels of all time: Emily Bronte&#039;s Wuthering Heights. Is this a fair comparison? No. But it will be much easier for me to reference Wuthering Heights since it accomplishes what 5 Centimeters Per Second

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181645">
        could not accomplish and is vital in addressing some of the more fundamental flaws of this movie.<br />

In Wuthering Heights, Catherine and Heathcliff are two seemingly inseparable lovers just as Takaki and Akari are. Additionally, Catherine and Heathcliff refuse to change just as Takaki and Akari do. Even in the face of marriages (Akari and Catherine), their loves for their respective &quot;similar beings&quot; persist. Both relationships are intended to be shown as the negative way in which relationships that never change can be detrimental to those involved and those surrounded by them. Examples from both works would include Kanae and Isabella. However, unlike in Wuthering Heights, no proper alternative to this destructive relationship is ever presented. The movie comes off as a frustrated and cynical criticism of this relationship without a proper solution as to how to resolve this issue. In Wuthering Heights, Hareton and Catherine share a relationship that develops in a normal enough manner and progresses and changes with time as Bronte views that a relationship should. If a lack of a solution is Makoto Shinkai&#039;s method of presenting a theme, then this should have been a problem drama rather than a romantic drama turned tragedy. It is generally much more difficult to offer a solution to a problem than to point out its existence. This is one of the primary reasons Emily Bronte is such a respected author today. Bronte shows the negative effects especially well through Heathcliff. In 5 Centimeters Per Second, the audience has to be told by Takaki himself that his morals deteriorated because of his obsessive love. However, Heathcliff experiences a physical and evident turn from an innocent man with a passionate love for Catherine to a vengeful and malevolent villain. The approach taken in Wuthering Heights is much more affective and helps the audience become more invested in what transpires.  Additionally, instead of facing his problems directly in the final scene, Takae walks away from his problems and refuses to apologize to those whom he hurt (i.e. Akari for not even telling her his true feelings when it is revealed that he could have easily done so or Kanae for refusing to even consider her as anything other than a friend). Shinkai couldn&#039;t even manage to have Takaki take a villainous role similar to what Heathcliff does in Wuthering Heights. Instead, it feels that everybody in 5 Centimeters Per Second needlessly suffers because Takaki is too cowardly to face his problems and tell anybody the truth about what he is feeling. Even in the end when he walks away from Akari, he has hurt her and himself by not running after her to apologize for never talking to her after their reunion. In fact, Takaki&#039;s problem is self perpetuated by his inability to act while Heathcliff simply is driven to becoming a bitter villain after his love, Catherine, is married to Edgar. More than anything else, the story feels like a major letdown and a source of missed potential.<br />

On the note of art style, the visuals are impressive and frequently serve to further and advance ideas and tone within the work. Such instances include the somewhat symbolic nature of the rocket launch in Tanegashima, the crossroads in Takaki&#039;s hometown, and the frequent changes in lighting and weather to influence mood (empathetic nature). The art style is impressive from a technical standpoint as well. However, there are some imperfections with the art. The art itself becomes noticeably more grainy in Episode 2 onwards (I don&#039;t know whether this is simply my computer acting up or that this really occurs. If you known the answer to this, please let me know). The bitrate also becomes noticeably slower, (once again, not sure if this is my computer or not).<br />
The sound and special effects are pretty average. There really isn&#039;t much of note in that regard.<br />

P.S. Thanks for reading this review! I just want to give a simple aside to the audience. If you have any constructive criticism on my writing style or the points that I bring up within the review, please feel free to let me know! I&#039;m always open to suggestions and realize that my writing is far from perfect. If you have some insight to this anime that I missed, please, feel free to let me know.

    Ok, this is a beautiful love story that is completed in one hour&#039;s time.  The animation and cinematography is excellent to the point that you almost forget you&#039;re not watching a real live-action movie.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the story itself is almost too painful to watch, for several reasons.  It is basically the story of painful, dysfunctional teenage romances.  Dysfunctional because in real life, I think there would be different outcomes with both of the romantic relationships explored by the film.  The author/screenwriters chose to go the &quot;Japanese Trainwreck&quot; route, which is frustratingly common in Japanese story telling.  Rarely is there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204255">
        ever a &quot;happily ever after&quot;.  Instead the audience suffers silently with an hour&#039;s worth of painful unrequited love.  It is almost as if half the population of Japan has been traumatized in their teenage years by unrequited love or love lost by forced separation, and half again must relive this through some form of art or film.  Beyond that, the story seems to end abruptly, with no real closure to either of the important story threads.  Frustrating.
