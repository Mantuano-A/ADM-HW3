    Like most fans of Lupin III, my first experience with the titular thief was with Hayao Miyazaki’s debut film “The Castle of Cagliostro.” It was simply a masterpiece with great action scenes, likeable characters, a heartwarming story, and excellent pacing. I consider Cagliostro to be one of the finest adventure films (animated or live-action) ever created and stands on my personal list of top movies. Anxious for more, I looked into the series and was amazed at how deep and spreading the franchise’s roots were. Lupin III is perhaps the most well-known and popular anime character of all time in Japan. There have been various

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91417">
        manga series, three television shows, one live-action movie, five animated films, various other animations, and yearly television specials that remain popular with the Japanese masses. Unfortunately, Lupin never really got firm foothold of international markets. While the likes of Goku and Pikachu are known worldwide, our green (or red or pink) jacketed thief still struggles to gain popularity outside of Japan to this very day. Despite this, Lupin III still manages to have a small, but loyal cult following. For those of you that don’t about Lupin, here’s a little backstory.<br />

The origins of Lupin III can be traced back to the early 20th century works of French writer, Maurice Leblanc. Essentially opposite of detective Sherlock Holmes, Leblanc created a gentlemen thief named Arsène Lupin. Like his title suggests, Lupin was thief, but a gentlemen in nature. He would always “politely” leave notes to the police indicating where and when he would steal something, but would always escape their grasp. His goal was really not to steal, but to live life on a dangerous edge and to savor every moment of the chase. Old Arsène enjoyed considerable popularity in his days and has a long-running franchise to him as well. Fast forward all the way to 1967. Professional manga artist Kazuhiko Katō was “discovered” buy a magazine company who was interested in his work. He was hired, and his boss at the time suggested the pen name “Monkey Punch.” The origins of that name aren’t exactly clear, but some speculate that it came from the ape-like look of some of Katō’s characters. Nevertheless, he wasn’t too fond of the name but chose it anyways since he was only attached to a three month project. The project? A comedic manga series that parodied Arsène Lupin’s many exploits. It starred the grandson of the thief with him and his gang going on many adventures throughout the series. The art was rugged and abstract, the humor was vulgar, and it was a huge hit. <br />
<br />
Following the success of the manga, Lupin III was soon picked up for anime form in 1969 by TMS Entertainment and Toho. Virtually unknown director Masaaki Ōsumi was hired to craft a short pilot film that introduced Lupin and his gang. The pilot was highly controversial at the time to say the least. The realistic violence and adult themes simply didn’t fly well with the companies, so the project never saw distribution. Two versions were produced: a 16:9 CinemaScope version intended for theatrical release and a 4:3 version meant for television. Despite the failure of the pilot, Lupin III was still picked up for a 26 episode television series. On October 24, 1971, anime history was made. <br />
<br />
For the first time ever, here was an anime series intended for adults and not just kids. Some episodes were loose adaptions of certain manga chapters, but most were original stories. Like the pilot film before it, the show had realistic looking guns and vehicles, violence, and darker plotlines. It seemed, though, that the Japanese animation industry wasn’t ready for such material. Initially, Masaaki Ōsumi directed the first few episodes. They were dark and gritty, with mature themes and sensibilities. Because of this, the show failed to gather the ratings it needed and Ōsumi was fired because he refused to change the tone. This is when Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata joined the show. You heard right, THAT Miyazaki and Takahata. Two of the most revered Japanese anime directors who brought us masterworks like Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies got their start on this show. When they did, everything changed. Now Lupin III was given more humor and the episodes noticeably became more family friendly. The show can be divided into three parts. The first eight or so episodes by Ōsumi are serious in tone. Sure there’s the occasional dry humor, but there’s gun fights and fan service shots aplenty here (though it could probably be considered as quite tame by today’s standards). The next section is the transition period. Here we see Lupin III slowly change from the dark nature and into more lightheartedness. By the time we reach the final portion, the show is now comedic and full of laughs, almost the polar opposite of how the show started out. The episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata are what the set the standard for the franchise to this very day, with the exception of the adult-themed Mystery of Mamo movie and recent Fujiko Mine series. This show as a whole never really had a set path or direction. Since this is the first ever show for the franchise, it feels very experimental at times and has many changes in tone and quality. Despite these changes, the ratings remained poor and the show was cancelled after only 23 episodes.<br />
   <br />
The basic premise is that master thief Lupin III (now sporting a green jacket unlike the red of his manga counterpart) is always trying to steal; whether its money, jewels, or treasure. I think that his character would best be described if you took the coolness of James Bond, the adventurous nature of Indiana Jones, and the niceness of Tintin; and put it all together. Lupin will always try to steal things, but he’s never without honor. Along the way, he’ll help anyone in need, won’t kill without reason, and he’s fiercely loyal to his friends. Speaking of which, Lupin is joined by a colorful cast of characters that represent his gang. There’s Daisuke Jigen, Lupin’s most trusted ally who’s a quick split-second gunman and Fujiko Mine, a seductive women whom Lupin is infatuated with. Because of this, he’s easily tricked or swindled by her. Early on in the series, he’s joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, descendant of the legendary Japanese samurai who actually existed in real history. Goemon has a blade that can cut just about anything, and seems to want to help Lupin just as much as he wants to kill him. The gang is constantly chased by Tokyo Metropolitan Police Inspector Koichi Zenigata, supposedly the descendant of fictional detective Zenigata Heiji. His only goal in life is to capture Lupin. He always fails, but that’s perhaps for the best. Throughout the series, Zenigata has actually captured Lupin on occasion; but quickly realizes that he has no other purpose in life. Later on in the franchise, it’s clear that Lupin and Zenigata both respect each other even if they’re constantly at odds. The ideas are always fresh and exciting, with little repetition between episodes. It really amazes that, even after 45 years, this series is still going with new ideas.<br />
 <br />
I haven’t even talked about the excellent voice actors yet. Lupin is played by Yasuo Yamada, a veteran seiyuu who voiced him for the rest of his life before his unfortunate death in 1995. Yamada brings out the perfect traits in Lupin. He’s cocky, suave, hard-boiled, classy, and even emotional all at the same time. Make no mistake, Yamada is the definitive voice of the character and no one else could have brought Lupin to life besides him. Yes, there have been other actors in the role of Lupin and they all do a fine job, but Yamada will be the one who’ll always be the most famous and well known. The tough and gruff Jigen is portrayed by Kiyoshi Kobayashi, historically known for playing the character in every single Lupin related animation with the exception of the 1987 OVA, “The Fuma Conspiracy,” where the entire cast was briefly replaced. It’s really impressive that this guy still voices him after all these years and he shows no signs of slowing down. Death Note fans might recognize Kobayashi as the voice of Watari. Fujiko’s seiyuu is Yukiko Nikaido, a talented actress who plays the femme fatale as a crafty and cunning woman who knows how to get what she wants. She would later be replaced by the more well-known Eiko Masuyama who has an equally impressive track record like Kobayashi. Masuyama, however, retired from the role in 2010. The no-nonsense samurai of few words, Goemon is voiced by Chikao Ōtsuka who some may know from One Piece and Dragon Ball. He is the father of Akio Ōtsuka of Metal Gear fame. Last but not least, we have Gorō Naya who plays Zenigata. Honestly, Zenigata’s over-the-top and hilarious performances are a joy to watch. He gives off all the right emotions and feelings that this character evokes. Unfortunately, Naya died only very recently (as of this writing), at the age of 83. Both Yamada and Naya will be sorely missed, but their legacy left behind will never be forgotten.<br />

I’ve talked about the characters, but what of the animation? At first glance, Lupin III seems primitive in its art style. But you know what? I like this kind of look. For the time, this was the highest quality animation available for television. Although it certainly shows its age, colors are still vibrant and sharp with the simplistic backgrounds nice as well. Characters move fluidly enough and action scenes play out nicely, but it’s obvious that some cheap tricks are used here and there. It doesn’t have the same thin cartoonish look as the second series, nor the gorgeous animation of Cagliostro, but I’m sure that most people will be satisfied with what they see. The audio side of things is more of a mixed bag. The main theme is a simplistic repetition of “Lupin the Third” sung in various tones. It may be basic, but just like the Batman theme, it’s pretty damn catchy. The ending theme is a more melancholic and bittersweet Japanese vocal song. These were all sung by Charlie Kosei, who does a pretty good job singing in both Japanese and English with excellent pronunciation. Although Kosei hasn’t been doing much recently, he contributed a song to the popular PlayStation 2 game Katamari Damacy. Within the series, there’s also background music by Takeo Yamashita. The themes are pretty basic to say the least, and there’s really not anything special, but it does the job when it needs too. For an amazing Lupin III soundtrack, check out the work of Yuji Ohno. He composed excellent jazz themes from the second series onward, and his addictive Lupin III main theme is still playing in my head even now.<br />
<br />
Exactly where can you get this series? If you live in Japan, it’s readily available on DVD and Blu-ray. Recently, though, North American anime distribution company Discotek Media released the entire series on Region 1 DVD for the very first time ever. This set boasts a brand new high quality video transfer, extensive liner notes on each episode, essays, song lyrics, a complete vehicle list, a complete weapons list, commentary on key episodes by Lupin fans, and even both versions of the original pilot film. It’s the ultimate release for any Lupin fan and I highly recommend you purchase this amazing set. Overall though, is Lupin III worth your time? I’d say without a doubt, yes. Not only is this an important and historical anime, it’s simply a fun show to watch. I’d even go as far to call this the “Cowboy Bebop” of the 1970s generation. The influence that this show had on the exploits of our Bebop crew is immediately noticeable. In fact, Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Watanabe has even gone on record to say that he was heavily inspired by this series, particularly with Ōsumi’s work. So there, you have it. An essential anime series that’s action-packed, entertaining, and full of great characters. It may be rough around the edges, as well as uneven in quality; but I guarantee you that you’ll have damn good time watching this series the whole way through. Check it out.         <br />

    The one that started it all.<br />
<br />
This is a legendary anime series about some instant classic characters, the Lupin gang. This is amazingly ahead of it&#039;s time, being the first anime starring criminals, the first gritty comparatively more realistic anime with guns and such. Not just for anime, it&#039;s ahead of it&#039;s time in general.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, it&#039;s still a joy to watch nearly 40 years later. Lupin is the cool, laid back antihero. This laid back style, helped by the very cool soundtrack, is still influential today in titles like Cowboy Bebop. Lupin has other sides to him too of course, he has an ego, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19549">
        he&#039;ll laugh like a maniac and take on any challenge. And of course, he gets pretty excited when there are ladies around, especially Fujiko.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are great here. You have Jigen, Lupin&#039;s partner and best friend. He&#039;s very cool himself, a smooth criminal, but he&#039;s also the voice of reason, a more mature criminal. Then you have Fujiko, the classic femme fatale cat burglar, she is Lupin&#039;s love  interest, and often his rival. Then there&#039;s Goemon, the renegade samurai with a strong moral code, who can cut anything. And of course, Inspector Zenigata, who tirelessly dedicates his life to capturing Lupin.<br />
<br />
Lupin is episodic, featuring 23 self contained stories. Although there is one plot that takes two episodes early on, with Goemon out to defeat Lupin. One episode Lupin is in prison, another time him and the gang have explosive watches put on that they can&#039;t take off. These are all great stories.<br />
<br />
An interesting thing about this series is that it has two different feels to it, depending on who is directing. Masaaki Osumi directs episodes 1-7, 9, and 12. These are the more dark and gritty episodes, and sometimes have a melancholy feel. These episodes are amazing, giving us the depth that the Lupin characters are built on.<br />
<br />
The founders of Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, direct episodes 8, 10-11, and 13-23. These episodes are also superb, with a more fun and upbeat feel, closer to what Lupin is known for today. You can tell Miyazaki is involved when Lupin starts saving cute damsels in a gentlemanly heroic way.<br />
<br />
All in all, Lupin III is a classic series, which is still going strong today with movie specials. I recommend checking this out, it&#039;s must see anime.

    Its the one that started it all. Sure, the manga is where Lupin was truly born, but in terms of beginning a legacy, the first television series can take a good chunk of the glory. While its impossible to review this without comparisons and/or contrasts to the second and third series, Lupin III has done enough to give itself its own limelight.<br />
<br />
On its own, Lupin III lays down a solid effort. There is action, intrigue, and betrayal...all of which would become staples of the Lupin franchise. The characters that will go on to become some of the most famous in anime history are established here.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12668">
        And while the animation is undoubtedly telling of its&#039; age, the standard for long, lanky legs and hairy hands is set. With all the good foundation that Lupin III sets for the franchise, there is, thankfully, one aspect that did not carry over...the music. The combination of hippy j-rock and the repetition of Lupins&#039; name does not make for a good soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Another trait that fails to carry over is the dark and dirty side of Lupin. Fans of the second series and later specials are familiar with family-friendly Lupin, but Lupin III allows for a much more serious, James Bond-type espionage story. During the course of the series, Lupin and the gang commit and encounter murder, violence against women, and even rape.<br />
<br />
As a stand alone series, I&#039;d give this a 7 out of 10. But Lupin III isn&#039;t a stand alone series. It, while having its own identity and place within the Lupin Franchise, does so much to establish Lupin and the gang as a powerhouse in the anime world. For any Lupin fan that wants too see how it all got started, I highly recommend this. For any old school anime fan, this is straight up your alley, so what have you been waiting for?<br />
<br />
And for everyone else, if you can find it, watch it. Bear with the hippy j-rock and enjoy a fun, exciting series that&#039;ll introduce you to the fun world of Lupin the Third.<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Red jacket? Green jacket? Who gives a shit?! Ok, now that I am done quoting Happy Gilmore, I will review what is without a doubt one of the most famous and beloved anime of all time...in Japan... and pretty much nowhere else.<br />
<br />
Background info:<br />
<br />
Lupin the 3rd started way back in the early 1970s and was created by the legendary mangaka known only as &quot;monkey punch&quot;. Yep, that&#039;s really what he calls himself. Lupin was created as a spoof/ homage of the character Arsene Lupin, who was a gentlemen spy in a series of French novels that were popular in the late 1800s and ran alongside the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169279">
        Sherlock Holmes stories. Along with spoofing low brow adventure  novels from 1800s France, Lupin also takes a lot of inspiration from James Bond and the spy movies and novels that were extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s. In his adventures, Lupin is joined by the femme fatale Fujiko, badass samurai Goemon, and awesome sharp shooter Jigen. Lupin has crazy adventures that mix slapstick comedy with awesome action and some of the first &quot;fanservice&quot; in anime history. <br />
<br />
Lupin in Japan vs. outside Japan:<br />
<br />
Lupin was a HUGE hit in Japan, and to this day recieves reboot after reboot. A new live action movie was created just this year and will be followed by sequels. However, for some reason Lupin has never been a very big deal overseas. Perhaps this is because the West was already saturated with slapstick comedy and James Bond parodies like &quot;Get Smart&quot;, which would have aired around the same time that Lupin first came out.<br />
<br />
Story and characters: 8/10<br />
<br />
The story and characters are so well known and beloved in Japan that even if you have never seen Lupin, you have probably seen it parodied or homaged dozens of times in other anime. For example, the red coat worn by the character Nabeshin in Excel Saga is an homage to Lupin, as are the character designs from Cowboy Bebop. Spike is based on Lupin, Jet = Jigen, Faye =Fujiko and Vicious = Goemon. The plot works because it is simple and usually doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously. The characters have great chemistry and each brings something to the mix.<br />
<br />
Music: 9/10<br />
<br />
Lupin was probably the first anime ever to have a truly KICKASS opening theme song. This was back in 1971 and no other animated show had an opening that mixed jazz, a smooth singer, and an awesome melody and beat like this one. The entire soundtrack is very jazz oriented, which started a huge trend in anime that continues to this day 40 years later!<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
<br />
The art really scares away some viewers because it has a very unique style. I would compare it to One Piece, but I actually think even the original Lupin from 1971 has better character art than One Piece. An interesting fact is that one of the key animators for the original Lupin was Hayao Miyazaki, who later became the main animator for one of the early Lupin movies.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
<br />
If you want to watch an anime that has stood the test of time and been HUGELY influential on the genre as a whole, then Lupin is an absolute must! It currently has a low rating on MAL of around 7, but don&#039;t let that dissuade you. Some people simply don&#039;t appreciate anything that is older than they are and don&#039;t care about influence, history, or enduring quality. I feel sorry for those people, because they miss out on a LOT of great stuff. If you don&#039;t want to watch the original series, at LEAST watch the 1979 movie Castle of Cagliostro. It is generally considered the the high water point of all things Lupin.

    Watching this anime in 2020 made me think that I would find this really outdated or difficult watching because of how I am used to modern anime style and high quality. Despite this anime being made in the 70s it’s an absolute stunner even now. Of course there are lags and sometimes delay in animation when a character speaks but I always remember how limited in technology and how difficult it would be to create a smooth animation at that time so I really don’t think too harshly of those small errors. <br />
<br />
Lupin the third part 1 is definitely a must watch. It’s comedic and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339791">
        entertaining story keeps anyone on their feet and some episodes really stick to you. I definitely could see how close Jigen and Lupin are and it’s a friendship that can’t be broken so easily. I really love the episodes when you see the two being goofy. Lupin III is just one of those anime’s that grows onto you like an old friend and you just reminisce on it. I definitely will go for a rewatch and would recommend it to pretty much anyone. Although I was so late in the game to start this series, I’m grateful I did. <br />
<br />
Definitely a hidden gem that got buried amongst time and age. I have watched the 2019 Lupin III but it didn’t get as much hype as many other anime. I hope this gem once again sparkles as it once did in the 70s

    Lupin the Third came into the realm of animation nearly a decade after the release of Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy anime. Lupin III is known as a classic to anyone who understands the history of the anime scene in Japan. This age of animation was a time when children grew up with the adventures of immoral ne’er-do-wells shooting off Walthers, a time when intelligent dogs with speech impediments were best friends with stoners, a time when sailors ate spinach to beat up kidnappers; It was an age when children wanted to grow up to be great heroes. Unfortunately the days of courageous, green-jacketed thieves like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147369">
        Lupin have been replaced with an era of black-haired trench-coated teenagers and mentally-troubled orphans. 60’s children, you are sorely missed.<br />
<br />
Lupin III is the episodic adventures of the infamous thief, Arsene Lupin the Third, dressed in his iconic green jacket and yellow tie, accompanied by his cohorts. Daisuke Jigen, Lupin’s right-hand-man, is a cynical sharpshooter loyal only to his partner. Goemon Ishikawa is a samurai of incredible talent, wielding a blade that would easily slice steel. Fujiko Mine is Lupin’s love-interest, ally, and greatest enemy all in one. Together they face the determination of red-faced Inspector Zenigata, a man of the law who has dedicated his life to imprisoning Lupin the Third. The characters are what one would expect from a well-loved cartoon of the 70’s: each one distinct in their personality and instantly recognizable.<br />
<br />
Lupin III is a clearly sexist show, having begun in the beginning of the 1970’s. Fujiko represents the mindset towards women at the time: traitorous and unpredictable. At the end of most episodes, Lupin’s latest trophy is immediately stolen by Fujiko. The classic conclusion to a Lupin III episode is Lupin crying out Fujiko’s name in frustration as she drives or flies off into the distance.<br />
 <br />
The animation style is also what one would expect of the time period. To us folk from the modern west, it seems to basically be the equivalent of an old episode of Scooby Doo: plain-faced characters with lanky bodies against noticeably hand-drawn backgrounds. To watch such a show today, it is certainly not without a feeling of nostalgia. The musical themes of Lupin III are especially memorable, what with the amusing English lyrics of the ending song and the catchy tunes of the openings.<br />
<br />
Lupin the Third is an all-around entertaining anime and the bearer of one of the most iconic characters in anime history. There is little value to be had with the show, the lack of morality is obvious, but I suppose it could be said that the message to be gained from Lupin the Third’s adventures would be similar to a quote by the lovely Oscar Wilde, “Life is too important to be taken seriously.”<br />

    I started to watch Lupin III in search of an answer,  how this franchise can be so old and vast.  Why people still watch it.  I expected Lupin to be some kind of anti-Bond.  He is a lover, adventurer, a gentleman and a thief.   Of course, I got what I expected.  I liked a bit more serious tone, more mature, as much seinen as show potentially could be.  And yet, despite everything above first 5 or so episodes were pretty boring.  <br />
<br />
When the director changed the story changed as well.  The show got to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319393">
        more family-friendly, with less and less erotic connotations, less serious and more comedic.  My opinion is ambivalent on this.  At some point, I felt that it turned to be a kids show as if I watch a cartoon for 5-year-olds.  But I have to say I started to enjoy the show more since the middle of the season.  The show benefited by changes.<br />
<br />
Another aspect that added to the feeling of kids show is the art style.  Obviously anime 40 years ago did not have the same character designs as it has now.  If I did not know it is Japanese, from the first glance I would think it is a Western show.  Also, the quality dropped from the first couple of episodes till the last ones.  If at the beginning the backgrounds were marvellous, in the end, they were meh, nothing special.<br />
<br />
There are some nice tunes and the first OP is superb.  But why at the second one they sing &quot;Rupá-Rupá&quot;,  regarding Lupin,  if the seyus easily pronounce his sirname as &quot;Lupá&quot;, as it would sound in French...<br />
<br />
Characters are great.  My personal favourite is Fujiko.  She is sexy, and smart and savvy. Great design and mischievous personality.  Perfect female thief.  Others are great too.  Jigen is an amazing friend,  never betrayed Lupin.<br />
<br />
I moderately enjoyed the show.  Every episode I found something I liked and something I disliked.  I understand why there is a fanbase over this show and why there are still sequels produced as TV shows and movies.<br />
<br />
Overall it is fun to watch.   I have to admit though, even with a more mature beginning, seinen as the main audience and rating PG-13 I still think it is more suitable for a younger audience.  Cartoons made by Tex Avery also have a lot of jokes revolving around sex and erotics,  but I watched it as a kid, and will show to my children.  Same goes to Lupin III.<br />

     Grab some books from Maurice Leblanc, the first James Bond movies, jazzy ost, japanese wackiness and you have Lupin III, an anime that sparked an entire franchise and a lot noir, criminal and old fashioned action animes such as Cowboy Bebop. Get your favourite coloured jacket and a gun, because we are driving in a Fiat 500 back to the past.<br />
<br />
- Story:<br />
 Part I is episodic, It doesn&#039;t really develop a solid story throught its 23 episodes (Except for the introduction of one the later members of the gang). Instead, is sporadic, jumping from heist to heist, to adventure to adventure in a weekly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302916">
        format. Today you are stealing a book that belonged to your grandfather and tomorrow you&#039;ll possibly attempting a very risky jailbreak. Normally I&#039;m skeptical episodic series in general, but Lupin knows for the most part how to use this format, as it allows the directors to put the gang into different type of situations without ruining or having to care about a plot line.<br />
<br />
-Characters:<br />
<br />
 Easily one of the best aspects of the Lupin series in general, and Part I is no exception to this rule. You have the four members of the Lupin gang, Lupin, the de facto leader and the charismatic, suave but comical protagonist. He always get what he wants (More or less). Jigen, the loyal gunman and sometimes, the voice of reason of the crew. Fujiko, a femme-fatale and Lupin&#039;s weakness. And last but not least, Goemon, a stoic samurai that sticks around with the crew, sadly, he feels more like a extra rather than a main character in most of Part I. You also have your run-of-the-mill villains and the tireless detective Zenigata, who for the most part gets the short end of the stick. This character are easily recognisable from each other and are quite likeable. And just like the story, they&#039;re simple, but great. <br />
<br />
- Art, direction and the rest:<br />
<br />
 Lupin III&#039;s animations are dated by our standars, but back in 1971, after the dark pages of Japan&#039;s history, it was the best that the industry had to offer not only that, but there was love put into them, bonus points for doing the best they could. The amount of attention to detail put into guns, vehicles and some extra stuff is pretty good. The characters designs are wacky, cartoon-ish and remind me to something straight out of those underground comics, I also like the contrast of the character designs with the more realistic approach in backgrounds and weapons. The sound and music are the best part of the technical section, the OST is very jazzy and offers a nice variation of tunes, the anime even has three openings with the same animation but with different songs.I&#039;m not an expert regarding sound effects, so I&#039;m going to say that they add a lot to the light hearted and wacky feel of the anime.<br />
<br />
- Let&#039;s wrap this up:<br />
<br />
Lupin III Part I despite how simple it is very enjoyable anime. It has a lot of charm that old animes have, it also shows a lot of creativity that the media lacks and if you manage to adapt to its rough presentation, you&#039;re in for a good time. It is also a great starting point to get into the Lupin franchise. Giving a rating to an anime is complicated if you want to do it seriously, but Part I gets a well deserved 7/10 and a high spot on my favourites for all the reasons that I stated on my review and many more.

    Rather than reviewing this series as a prelude to the whole franchise (like reviewers before), I&#039;d prefer to review the series and just the series.<br />
<br />
Lupin III is a master thief, a unsuccessful womaniser, a mad genius capable of stealing anything and escaping from anywhere, companied by his gang, and chased by Zenigata like Bugs Bunny by Elmer Fudd.<br />
<br />
In overall, very enjoyable comedy series.<br />
<br />
STORY: 8/10<br />
There&#039;s no overall spanning story, each episode can by watched separately. After first three episodes, which have a weird feel, next twenty are typical thievish things. Lupin either tries to steal something, tries to escape from jail, or tries to escape from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25206">
        people who are after his life. To achieve this, he makes a plan involving disguise, misdirection, violence, explosives and a lot of awesomeness. Yes, violence - this anime is not for kids, thankfully, so it doesn&#039;t turn into a kiddy cartoon show. Coz kids shouldn&#039;t watch series where the main character is, well, a thief.<br />
The episodes can be from lighthearted to dark and violent, but they&#039;re all funny (well, the third ep was the most serious one). <br />
If you wish, you can skip first 3 eps, I think they&#039;re not Lupinish enough.<br />
<br />
ART: 7/10<br />
Well, it was the seventies, so the art is not great, but it has its cartoonish feel. For the first glance, it looks nowhere like modern Japanese animation. Despite its drawbacks, the art suits the show.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9/10<br />
Apart from the OP for the first few episodes (&quot;Lupin Lupin Lupin the third&quot; all over), we get lot of awesome music. The music can be compared to music in European animation. On the other hand, dubbing quality and sound effects suffer from being from the 70s, so they can be considered one of the weak points of the series. But all classic things are like this, ain&#039;t they?<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 10/10<br />
First, we&#039;ve got Lupin.<br />
A madman, who&#039;d do anything to achieve his goal, but never turns his back on the damsel in distress. Unpredictable, eager to act, with unusually accurate intuition. He&#039;s being the main source of humour in the series - you&#039;ll never know, what trick he will pull out.<br />
Secondly, we&#039;ve got Fujiko. You never know, on which side is she. Her main hobby is stealing things Lupin has just stolen, but she often gives him a helpful hand.<br />
Then, we&#039;ve got Zenigata. A man with a precise aim in his life: to catch Lupin.<br />
And last but not least, Jigen and Goemon. Those two are Lupin&#039;s straight men, more rational and less impulsive (but Goemon&#039;s honour can be easily offended), masters of gun and katana respectively.<br />
Due to series&#039; episodic nature, there&#039;s little character development, but the characters are themselves original enough to keep you entertained.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9/10<br />
First three episodes were kinda weak, but the rest of them were relaxing and funny. Larger amount of Lupin can feel repetitive, so my advise is to limit yourself to 5 episodes per day.<br />
Lupin is great to watch, either alone, or simultanously with other, probably serious series (I watched Lupin to cheer myself up while watching NGE and Hellsing, and man it helped a lot.)<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9/10<br />
If you want some comedy, you enjoyed The Olsen Gang, or you want to relax with something less moe-moe-kyun, Lupin is just for you.<br />

    all legends have a beginning and this is the beginning of Lupin The Third, The legendary first series ,He influenced a lot in the industry, being a fundamental piece for the seinen genre, influencing works such as cowboy bebop as well as the career of hayao miyazaki, it is true that animation may not look so much after 50 years, but the stories are extremely original and ahead of its time, It is surprising that the franchise has managed to last to this day, but with a tremendous start I already understand why <br />

    This is where things began for the famous Lupin III franchise starting from here all the way to the franchise&#039;s most recent adaptation, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, over the span of 40 years. It also has some notoriety to it with the differences in series direction, story setup and presentation thanks to the very concept of the series. Lupin III was one of the very first TV anime titles geared for an older audience, which is most certainly shown with the title&#039;s focus on a criminal in the form of international thief Lupin, scenes of violence that showed characters killed onscreen, sexual innuendo and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review78832">
        content compliments of Lupin&#039;s perversion and Fujiko&#039;s seductive charm and a gritty look into the criminal underworld that Lupin and his group are regularly involved with. The show&#039;s concept was ahead for its time, but was also a bit controversial as many anime titles of the early 1970s were still rather wholesome in content, traditionally focused on the &quot;good guys&quot; as protagonists and geared for younger audiences. This backlash, combined with low TV ratings at the time of the show&#039;s airing in earlier episodes, led to a change in directors which led future iconic directors Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki to take the reigns of directing the series to make the series more comical, tone down the violence and sexual content of earlier episodes and make Lupin and his crew more sympathetic. Even with the changes, the show still suffered from low ratings and was cancelled after 23 episodes. It wasn&#039;t until airing reruns of the series later in the decade that led to the show finally gaining popularity and having later TV show, movie, OVA and TV special adaptations to come along with it.<br />
<br />
Taking all this in mind, you will certainly see some clear differences in how the two halves of this first Lupin III TV anime series perceive itself. Much of the first half to the anime is following the manga adaptation&#039;s setup rather faithfully with Lupin and his crew being willing to kill off those in the way of their capers and Fujiko not afraid to use her body to dupe Lupin and others into getting what she wants. When the second half of the series comes along under Takahata and Miyazaki&#039;s direction, you will notice how it takes after the elements that many Western fans would be familiar with from Lupin in Castle of Cagliostro as Lupin&#039;s gang only steal from those who can take the loss and very likely a part of the criminal underworld, they don&#039;t kill anyone in their capers except as a last resort, will take the time to dispatch criminals who commit worst crimes than they have, Fujiko doesn&#039;t resort to her seductive charm to rob others and Lupin isn&#039;t as perverted in his womanizing.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s storylines are mostly episodic as they mostly consist of Lupin and his gang planning out and executing some sort of theft and/or crossing paths with Zenigata and/or whichever criminal/ wealthy person they cross paths with. There are some relevant plot details that this series takes to exploring during Lupin&#039;s capers such as how Goemon meets with and joins Lupin&#039;s gang, the unique relationship between Fujiko and Lupin and Lupin&#039;s family roots. While many episodes are self-contained with their plot and follow a standard formula in how their plots are laid out, there is enough diversity in the types of capers that Lupin&#039;s gang are involved with which keeps this first TV anime from getting stale. While the series is known for possessing quite a bit of slapstick and &quot;toon forcing&quot; at points with its comedy being prevalent, it was still quite entertaining and engaging to see the chemistry between members of Lupin&#039;s gang, Zenigata and whichever criminals are found within an episode and many episodes are still grounded in following the capers of Lupin. This doesn&#039;t necessarily mean all the plots to Lupin were perfect as some resorted to a sci-fi or fantasy element (time traveler, girl whose life force was connected to flowers) that were a bit too out there compared to other episodes in the series.<br />
<br />
Being a 40-plus year old anime series, don&#039;t expect much in the visual department for Lupin III as the animation style is quite outdated, simple in its details and there are quite a bit of animation shortcuts and errors to notice. The music mostly consists of carefree and energetic musical pieces and songs from the early 70s that do well enough to get you latched on the antics and actions of the characters in this series.<br />
<br />
If you are a Lupin III that has seen later parts of the franchise, this first series is a definite recommendation to allow one to know how things got started in the 40-plus year anime saga of the titular thief&#039;s long-running and popular franchise.

    Lupin III changed the market for anime by introducing a cast of adult characters with adult stories and problems, attempting to breathe maturity into a medium whose initial visionary created in the shadow of the legendary Walt Disney. <br />
<br />
The show narrates the escapades of the titular phantom thief, his right hand man Jigen, and his lady friend Fujiko. Heist, capers, and kidnappings abound as the gang seeks out their latest thrill.<br />
<br />
Part 1 of this watershed franchise is where Lupin first leapt onto broadcast television. Its sound design and animation unfortunately reflect the times more than the capability of its staff, but with older productions from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254940">
        anime’s very infancy a certain unrefinement is to be expected by the viewer. Part 1’s production does the job: it conveys its narrative with enough audiovisual engagement to weave a story. Those searching for eye-melting sakuga sequences or emotionally evocative soundtracks should turn their attention elsewhere. <br />
<br />
What Part 1 DOES offer is an admittedly delightful romp of elementary crime capers that earnestly presents its cast and situations in a charmingly campy manner. Its best episodes play the tried and true archetypes of Arsene Lupin III, Jigen Daisuke, and Fujiko Mine to their fullest, making for brief 20 minute stints of amusing jokes, goofy interactions, and ridiculous action. The primitive production actually worked in service of my connection with the Lupin gang during these moments; ridiculous tunes and bright, simple colors elevate the unfolding mayhem on screen.<br />
<br />
Lupin III can be delightful for a few afternoons of chuckles and relaxation.<br />
<br />
Even as I viewed it through the simple unpresumptuous lens the production aspires to, a “sort of funny anime where entertaining things happen to lovable characters,” Lupin III Pt 1 fell short of being the perfect crime in one critical area: consistency.<br />
<br />
Even excusing the different ideas brought by its various directors, Part 1 possesses no sense of itself or its cast, with various elements changing or even disappearing across episodes. Nothing flows, as if the staff did not know what sort of characters the Lupin gang should be or what sort of stories the gang could tell. <br />
<br />
Lupin III Pt 1 suffered from acute growing pangs. By later Lupins, a majority of its issues with consistency were sorted out and the resulting packages feel much more cohesive. Part 1is a different beast entirely: it regularly messes with its world’s internal logic, switches up its tone, and perhaps most offensively juggles the personalities of its cast. Lupin’s a good thief, Jigen’s a “cool gunman,” Fujiko is ambiguous, and samurai Ishikawa Goemon is a hardass. Those are the only constants across the 26 episode runtime. The relationships between the characters, how they play off each other to execute gags, and their own desires seem liquid for no artistic purpose. As a note, my own tolerance for Lupin III’s lack of vision as to what it wanted to be might be lower than most.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, Lupin III’s first anime outing is an enjoyable ride. The production gave birth not only to a new demographic for the at the time infantile medium of anime, but also served as the premiere anime endeavor for legendary names Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki. As a project in isolation it fails to deliver truly excellent entertainment in virtually any regard, but it deserves an audience for its amusing antics and deserves respect for its ambitious legacy to a medium that lacked identity, even if its own identity search runs parallel to early anime’s adolescence.

    Ah, it feels so nice to not be reviewing a Gundam series for once. Sadly what I’m reviewing isn’t that good either. Look I won’t exactly call myself a Lupin expert, but I wouldn’t really call myself a noob either. I’m making my way through the franchise and having fun, and overall I can see why it has lasted so long as, for now, I’m definitely hooked. That said, even I don’t hold its first series (Nicknamed “Green Jacket” by the fanbase) in that high regard.<br />
<br />
I should note that for all Lupin reviews I’ll be throwing away my usual analysis method as, well after a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310428">
        while it would become monotonous. Everything will basically be a bunch of random observations that will culminate in my final thoughts. So, let’s get on with this.<br />
<br />
I guess I should start by saying that for the early 70’, this show has some insane production values. I wouldn’t say the show looks great, but for the time this impressive. Everything looks crisp, and while the movement is minimal, it gets the point across quite well. It reminds me of some of the older Looney Toons shorts as well, with the characters being extremely expressive.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is also magnificent. While I do wish there were a few more songs, the whole soundtrack is comprised of some damn classy jazz music that is extremely pleasing to the ear, with some minor Hispanic rock added in for good measure for some of the more energetic scenes as, well, Jazz doesn’t exactly mesh well with every scene. The only problem is that there are a tad few many scenes in which there is absolutely no music even though it could’ve deeply needed it.<br />
<br />
This is also where a decent bit of what would become Lupin’s main cast for the years to come was established. I say most of as Yukiko and Goemon have different actors here (Being played by NIkado Yukiko and the Late Great Otsuka Chikao respectively) this was the debut of the Late Great Yamada Yasuo and the Late Great Naya Goro as Lupin and Zenigata, roles that they would hold for the rest of their lives. And of course, there’s the MVP of the Lupin cast himself, Kobayashi Kiyoshi, reprising his role from the Pilot Film as Jigen.<br />
<br />
Now I should mention that if you’re a fan of ongoing storylines, you’re not gonna get it here. Bar a small set of episodes meant to introduce Goemon early on, this show has no ongoing storyline, being more like a set of short stories with the Lupin cast as the focus. This series does do a good job at introducing you to the cast, with Lupin being flirtatious and a prankster (Though very clearly still a criminal), Jigen a stoic, badass gunslinger, Zenigata being a man who proves himself to be the only one who could even dream of catching up to the legendary thief, and Yukiko being a beautiful femme fatale who’s true loyalties are to herself and no one else. The exception to this is Goemon, who is a tad more expressive and impulsive compared to the more Traditional Samurai personality later works gave him.<br />
<br />
I’ll also admit that this show is rather entertatining. The episodic format leads to a lot of enjoyable scenarios, and there isn’t really any episode I would call outright bad. Less enjoyable than others? Sure, but not necessarialy something I regret watching. My favorite episode has to be the one in which Lupin needs to get out of jail. The whole episode is an exercise in genious storytelling and foreshadowing, and easily the show’s highlight.<br />
<br />
So, if I’m praising this show so much, why did I give it a 6? Simple: It’s extremely inconsistent. As most people know, the show was originally helmed by Ohsumi Masaaki, who gave the show a rather dark tone. I’ll admit it’s often a tad too dark even for me, but it’s still enjoyable, with his only issue being that he sometimes seemed to forget that Lupin was a thief, as he didn’t steal that much stuff. Then he was fired due to low ratings and was replaced by Miyazaki Hayao and the Late Great Takahata Isao. Takahata is easily my favorite of the directors in this show; his stories had just the perfect balance, being a tad goofy, while still having some occasional black comedy, AKA: What most people love about Lupin! By contrast I couldn’t care less about Miyazaki’s (Admittedly few) episodes. I am gonna save my complains about them whenever I get around to reviewing Castle Of Cagliostro, so all I’ll say is this: I don’t care how much of a legend he is as an animation director, he does not get Lupin. Or rather, he does get Lupin, but he decides to write him as if he was just another one of his characters that isn’t Lupin.<br />
<br />
So overall, with such a tonal clash, it’s hard to call this show that good. While in terms of presentation it is great, it is so bipolar that it is hard to truly call the show good as a whole. Somehow, I am not surprised this show bombed in its original airing in Japan, as it is not that great. Still though, I can also see why it did well in reruns, and it’s not a bad show by any means. But if someone asked me if I recommended this as their first experience into the franchise, my answer is… maybe.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    One of the few original anime that are still as good now as they were back then. If you are a person that likes mystery anime and enjoys perverted quirky humor than this is the anime for you. I encourage everyone to watch it, it&#039;s very lighthearted and doesn&#039;t take any serious commitment. For the most part each episode is independent of the others and can be watched in any order. There isn&#039;t any deep story or heavy themes it&#039;s just a fun action and mystery anime with hilarious situations and witty dialogue.

    Lupin the Third is great for any age and I love the 70&#039;s and 60&#039;s jokes/humor that you just don&#039;t see nowadays. The only critiscism i have is I wish there were more two part episodes so that they could build a little more suspense. The episode where lupin stays in prison for a whole year is truly a wonderful piece of art, and it really is great for the character development of one of the best Anime/Manga characters ever designed. I give it a 9 because it&#039;s basically impossible for an Anime to get a 10 in my view.

    I started with Lupin back when it was run late night on Adult Swim. I was iffy about it based on the strange animation style. And I wasn&#039;t too crazy that the show seemed to be just about a thief and an inept detective. But this first series that started it all is worth watching as a fan of the Lupin franchise. <br />
<br />
STORY: An inept detective? Well, I suppose that depends on the director or writer. In quite a bit of the first Lupin series Zenigata is a VERY good investigator who just happens to be dealing with someone who is even better. There&#039;s an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review122599">
        episode where Zenigata captures Lupin and keeps a watchful eye on him for years, only for Lupin to get his revenge as he&#039;s going to the gallows. It really made me go, &quot;wow!&quot; Both Lupin and Zenigata were very well developed so early on. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: This first series is worth a watch as it introduces you to Lupin the Third, a world renowned thief, his partner Jigen, Fujiko, Zenigata, and we first meet Goemon. How they meet is a great story. What kills me about the series though is how non-canon it can be. There&#039;s an episode where Fujiko is playing Goemon&#039;s girlfriend, then a later episode where she is in a very mild disguise (like hair dye and that&#039;s it) and auditioning to be one of his students. But he doesn&#039;t notice? I think that&#039;s both a great thing and a very frustrating thing about the Lupin franchise...you should take the series like someone is telling you a story...and can&#039;t quite remember all the details. All the characters&#039; will remain the same, but their history will change quite a bit. <br />
<br />
ART: While the art is out there, it fits with the manga. I think the style of this series was better than some of the later Lupin specials put out in that two-tone style from the 90s. <br />
<br />
SOUND: Well, I&#039;m partial to the English dub that began in the second tv series, but the voice actors were always great and the music as well. Who can forget the two main Lupin openings, one which is still prevalent in every single Lupin special?<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: I think Lupin is an anime staple. Watch it.<br />

    Lupin the Third: Part 1 is an absolutely charming and educational anime that all people interested in the history of anime or of a huge Japanese franchise should absolutely watch. It holds up very well in certain parts, but its awkward mix of maturity and childishness is overall a mixed bag that depends on your personal tastes.<br />
<br />
As many others have mentioned, this is not only the first official Lupin release, but also the least consistent. It starts out as a gritty and dark crime drama focusing on womanizer thief Lupin the Third and his sharpshooter partner Daisuke Jigen, but slowly progresses into a fun and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271974">
        friendly crime-based comedy that seems to work more like an animated sitcom than the thriller it, at first, set out to be. This is apparently due to network ratings, which showed the first run of Lupin on TV as unfavorable at its worst, and resulted in director Osumi Masaki being given joint directorial duties with (now, well-known names) Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Through the talents of Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin found success as a family-friendly comedy focusing on the hijinks of the Lupin Gang, rather than any violent drama Masaki had in mind. (From what I understand the original manga was also quite dark. Take that as you will.)<br />
<br />
This show, as a result, is completely subjective. Will you prefer the hard-boiled beginning, with genuine murder and chaos? Or the goofy and hectic second half, with slapstick and complete ignorance of physics? Personally, I liked aspects of both. At its best, Lupin Sansei Part 1 is enthralling and creative, putting unique spins on spy/crime thriller tropes using its animated medium and various visual and aural talents. There are some absolutely epic moments from the lead, with his crafty gunslinging and escape artistry hidden behind a facade of a humorous and fun-loving gentleman. The comedy hits most of the time, too! Watching Lupin mess with the codgy old Zenigata is a treat in its own right.<br />
<br />
The age shows, though. The animation is pretty terrible by today’s standards, though holding true to its roots as an “adult-marketed” cartoon, the guns and cars look absolutely marvelous and, at their best, photo-realistic. Facial features are immediately recognizable and charming. The real drawbacks are in the backdrops and any background characters. They’re more outlines of what should be there than actual backgrounds.<br />
<br />
The music, while repetitive, with constant chants of “Rupan the Third!” and “Walther P38,” (Lupin’s trademark gun which he doesn’t use very much) can pump you up or bring sweet closure to a comedic moment depending on the situation. I’d say it’s used very well. <br />
<br />
I would have to argue that the staying power of the Lupin III series comes from the character designs and personalities. Over these 23 episodes, with no previous knowledge of the series, I fell in love with Lupin’s heartfelt smile and shining eyes, Jigen’s cranky, but sage advice, with a trigger finger to match, and Fujiko’s demure but malicious tendency to betray everyone. Zenigata’s hard-working demeanor and childish frustration was equally endearing. (As much as Goemon is a well-known mainstay, he isn’t in many of these episodes. Ah well.) The voice cast is phenomenal as well, and most reprised their roles for later seasons.<br />
<br />
Is it excellent? No. Is it boring at times, and repetitive? Yeah, sure. Is it a good time for casual viewing? Absolutely. Lots of corny, physics-defying moments, obvious reveals, cheesy one-liners, and great characters adds up to a lovely time machine from 1971 Japan, and I absolutely adored every minute of it! 7/10.<br />

    Last year in my review for Lupin the third Plot Film. I gave my backstory with the franchise &amp; mentioned that I had regain my interested in the franchise&#039;s titular character. I have seen Castle of Caglioastro and the three OVAs directed by Takeshi Koike of Redline fame. So far have enjoyed what&#039;s I&#039;ve seen. I wanted to watch the first Lupin the third series.<br />
<br />
The first thing I notice is how James Bond influence the anime is in it&#039;s earlier episodes with it&#039;s villains, traps, Femme fatal &amp; adult themes. It has a serious tone with silly moments sprinkled thru out. Which I frequently enjoyed.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review344751">
        As the anime goes on it starts to shift it&#039;s tone to a more comedic goofy tone dropping the serious tone. Which I was a little disappointed about.<br />
The Episodes for me started off really strong in the beginning being new to the series, getting to know these characters. But I wanna say at Episode 10 the episodes become a hit or a miss. They are either Great (Which I would consider to be one of my favorite episodes) Good or Average. It all depends on the plot of the episode. But I will tell you this all the episodes have entertaining moments.  <br />
<br />
I do have a couple of negatives one would be how they drop a story line with one of the main character cause the shift of the tone of the show and The villains not being that smart. There a few villains that have out match lupin and his gang.         <br />
<br />
The Characters<br />
<br />
I pretty much like them all. You get to know the characters persona really quick <br />
<br />
I always thought Lupin was cool in the other movies that I&#039;ve seen but watching him in his own series makes the character more interesting. Seeing how he thinks &amp; acts, his likes and dislikes. Other then just jumping into the movies Blindly. Lupin is more psychotic in the earlier episodes. There&#039;s a episode with Inspector Zengata that gives a insight on the Zengata and Lupin relationship. It shows you the purpose of the Zengata Character. Which I thought was interesting. <br />
<br />
Jigen and Goemon these two characters are pretty one dimension even tho I really like Jigen whenever cracks a joke. Goemon is a character I can&#039;t get into so far. He doesn&#039;t fit the rest of the characters in the anime, you have two thieves, a gunslinger a Inspector &amp; a Samurai. He seems out of place.    <br />
<br />
Fujiko Mine has gotten a slight update from the plot film. She doesn&#039;t really do much in the early episodes. She&#039;s the Femme fatale, Damsel in Distress, Fan service. Who betrays Lupin a lot. Just to say Fujiko Betraying Lupin &amp; Being the Damsel in distress gets old really quick. Before she is given more to do. The Lupin / Fujiko Rivalry trying to one up each other Stealing Valuables is really fun! I love this!  For her first official incarnation she&#039;s rather cute then hot LMAO. It&#039;s gonna be interesting seeing her character design evolve thru the decades.<br />
<br />
The first opening theme at first I didn&#039;t like. I thought it was repetitive but after a while it grew on me really fast just for them to modify the opening with narration introducing you the characters. Out of the three opening themes the third one has to be my favorite due to it having a little Spanish flavor   <br />
<br />
You can see some of the influence The anime has had in Takeshi Koike&#039;s Redline with the Anime&#039;s first opening Lupin running from a hail of bullets. The sequence in Redline introduction Lynchman &amp; Johnny boy has a little sequence that&#039;s really similar to the opening. In the first episode of the anime in the race that Lupin has entered the announcer  announces one of the racers is driving a Maclaren Which made me think of Sonoshee Maclaren from Redline even tho it could be a mare coincidence.<br />
<br />
In conclusion The first Lupin the Third anime series is worth a watching for people who want to get into the franchise to get to know the characters at only 23 episodes.

    This is the first animated series with the amazing third generation thief, Lupin with his gang of buds Goemon the samurai and Jigen the marksman. Also, one can&#039;t forget about the mystery cunning and sexy woman that is Fujiko Mine whom Lupin is totally weak in the knees for.<br />
Lupin III is episodic in every sense, and if James Bond was a thief, he would be Lupin. This is a fantastic show with each episode keeping your interest in the crew, and when will Inspector Zenigata (whom has devoted his entire life to catching Lupin) finally put the cuffs on Lupin.<br />
Each character is totally lovable and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188381">
        once you watch a few episodes you will quickly realize how this show even stands up today. The art style stands the test of time, music is wonderful, and really pushes the boundaries of the time in which it came out.<br />
If you are an old-school anime fan and need something to watch from the 70&#039;s that isn&#039;t a super robot, look no further than the womanizing thief himself.<br />
