    This anime is ok. Maybe it was a pilot of a TV series that couldn&amp;rsquo;t really take off. Who knows. I felt if this was developed in the same way Hajime no Ippo is, then it could have really worked. The series leaves you wanting for more because Ayane just wins fights out of luck and not really on skill. Watching this makes you realize it does have a lot of potential if they went on with it. But I felt it had some flaws, like we don&amp;rsquo;t see Ayane taking her kickboxing license exam. I mean, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t she have realized that by then? I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8590">
        would have liked it if they showed us that just to see how she handled it and how she got her license to fight. It&amp;rsquo;s a major plot hole and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make any sense. Then again, Ayane is portrayed to be a student with bad grades, so we are to assume she is a total ditz to some extent I guess. <br />
<br />
And the rest of the cast is really generic. Like I&amp;rsquo;m assuming the Tange name is paying homage to Tange Danpei from Ashita no Joe, another anime I have reviewed in the past. They do develop some sort of relationship, but not really a father daughter relationship that could have worked like you see between Kamogawa and Ippo in Hajime no Ippo since you really don&amp;rsquo;t see Ayane&amp;rsquo;s father in this. It maybe would be clich&amp;eacute;, but it works and feels natural. Sometimes clich&amp;eacute;s are a good thing in some animes. And then you got Miyagawa, she&amp;rsquo;s practically Ivan Drago and Floyd Mayweather packed in one. She&amp;rsquo;s like Ivan Drago with her training methods minus the steroids and how she&amp;rsquo;s a machine, and she&amp;rsquo;s like Mayweather flashing her wealth and how she publicly trash talks. So it&amp;rsquo;s your typical sports fight story but with a female perspective.<br />

The design first of all is just typical of what you saw in most animes in the mid-1990s. It had the brighter resolution, and sharper faces and bigger eyes then you&amp;rsquo;re use to seeing. Pretty much what you see in other animes like Slayers, Tenchi, and Sabre Marionett J is what you see in this anime. So in comparison to most mid-90s anime out there, the art design isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything distinctive, but in no means what I consider un-tolerable.<br />
<br />
The fights themselves, though only 2 are descent, just wish the anime could have taken the time and give the viewers an educational insight on kickboxing like how Hajime no Ippo does for boxing. Plus, the rounds are like 30 seconds each. It&amp;rsquo;s just the first round, Ayane is getting beat, 2nd round, she has her rhythm going on, and 3rd round, it&amp;rsquo;s even and Ayane gets lucky and wins. It&amp;rsquo;s too basic and one-dimensional and you don&amp;rsquo;t get different kinds of fights as you&amp;rsquo;d see in the other anime I&amp;rsquo;ve been somewhat comparing this too. It&amp;rsquo;s not about comparing boxing and kickboxing, but overall executing the concept of the central sport in relation to this anime. But I like how Kourakuen Hall is accurately represented from inside and out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there three times and have fought there as an amateur once, so I feel like I can relate to it in that aspect. <br />
<br />
For the dub, it&amp;rsquo;s actually not that bad. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing special, but nothing to a point where they&amp;rsquo;re intolerable or you don&amp;rsquo;t feel they have no representation to the personalities or the traits of the characters. I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with too many dub actors with the exemption of like ocean studios so this is as far as I can comment on. So you can watch this anime whether you prefer Japanese or English and you&amp;rsquo;ll still get the same fulfillment.<br />
<br />
But on the Japanese side, you got big names like Miyamura Yuko, the voice of Asuka from Evangelion playing Ayane; Ohtsuka Akio the voice of Snake from Metal Gear playing Tange, the trainer; and Yamaguchi Kappei the voice of Ranma and Inuyasha playing Ayane&amp;rsquo;s fight fan friend, Kappei. So seiyuu buffs such as myself should give this a shot. The music itself is very energetic. The theme songs give a fighting spirit feel to it, but also have a feminine touch. You also got the theme songs remixed into guitar for it to go with the training montages so nothing much to say.<br />
<br />
By the time we get to this point of my review, you already get the idea that overall to the anime community. This is nothing too special. Which I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, but it&amp;rsquo;s still nothing really downright awful either. But I say if you like Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe, Tough, or any martial arts action anime that doesn&amp;rsquo;t excessively defy the laws of physics, then this anime is for you. Despite the main character being female, it&amp;rsquo;s still appealing to both genders because of the action appeal though I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really call the quality of the action high octane. People will probably love it or hate it for all the right reasons, or think it&amp;rsquo;s ok, also for the right reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth a rental.

    Today I am going to revisit an uber obscure anime. How obscure? I&#039;ve never met another person in my life offline that has actually seen this one, yet it somehow got an English dub! This OVA lost funding due to lack of interest and only 2 episodes were ever  made, even though it was clearly intended to be a running series. Consider this a pilot for a TV show that never took off. Why would an American dub studio bring over an anime that only had 2 episodes and simply ended?!<br />
<br />
The answer is because CENTRAL PARK MEDIA! This infamous dub studio plagued American Otaku

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194386">
        during the 1990s and is now fortunately bankrupt. Central Park&#039;s leader was a guy named John O&#039;Donnell, who was a Texas multi millionaire. He founded an anime publisher and dub studio basically for the sole purpose of trolling. He either brought over and adapted the worst titles known to man, or titles that only had a few episodes and left you wanting more... which of course you were never going to get. Sometimes he used his own money to create sequels to obscure anime, but only titles that NO ONE asked for! If people actually wanted to see a sequel, he refused to fund it. Most leaders are driven by rational self interest and make decisions that will benefit them personally. However, you occasionally get that one guy that frequently does stuff that doesn&#039;t actually benefit him, but he does it anyways JUST to piss people off and give the whole world the middle finger! <br />
<br />
Plot and characters: 5/10<br />
<br />
The plot is that there is a girl obsessed with pro-wrestling, who is reluctantly drawn into the world of kick boxing instead after a gruff old boxing manager notices her strong legs and perfect figure for kick boxing. It is sort of combination of Rocky meets Happy Gilmore. In the style of Gilmore, it is a zany comedy about someone who really wants to be good in one sport, but they suck at it and are absolutely amazing at a sport they initially dislike. Like Rocky, it features a naturally talented, but low ranked boxer going through a ridiculous amount of training montages with a coach that is basically an anime clone of Mickey from the first 3 Rocky movies. &quot;Chase the chicken!&quot; &quot;YOU&#039;RE GONNA EAT LIGHTNING AND YOU&#039;RE GONNA CRAP THUNDER!!!&quot; This series is cheesy, amusing, and I am kind of sad that it didn&#039;t get any love from anime fans at the time. The only thing this series needed was a Survivor soundtrack, Mr. T being a badass, and wildly inaccurate geography featuring 14,000 ft snow capped mountains just outside of Moscow! <br />
<br />
Art and sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The art is pretty good for an old anime with close to zero budget. The soundtrack is forgettable, so just mute it during the training montages and play the Rocky theme! FUCK YEAH!<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
This was an amusing little 2 episode pilot that could have been a hit series if it was marketed better and found the right audience. Obviously it is WAY too late to start a kickstarter and demand that the animation studio make this series, but when I was done watching it I almost felt the temptation to try. If Seikon no Qwasar could get 2 separate 26 episode seasons and Ikki Tousen and Kodomo no Jikan could each somehow get 3 fucking seasons, why did this only get 2 episodes? This is an underrated series that deserved a LOT more than it got.

    To think Ayane-chan High Kick should have been a complete series, but the producers behind this didn&#039;t had the money to contineu this series or just didn&#039;t knew how to handle money and/or there was no intrest aswell. Kinda of a shame for being their first debut as a studio. Apparantly it was intented to have six episodes. Someone with a lot of money please build a time machine and go back to 1997 and sponser this anime project. It was pretty OK actually. Good enough to share some own thoughs with this, just to give Ayane High Kick a bit more love that it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318139">
        deserves.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
Meet Ayane Mitsui, a redhead high school girl that wants to be a pro wrestler, but got tricked into the world of kickboxing. That&#039;s the story. I know the two sports don&#039;t really match each other, but I think I can understand the message they were trying to tell here with this story. It&#039;s all about the journey how you want to achieve your goals. To bad we&#039;ll never know if Ayane would have succeeded her goal.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
Ayane High Kick&#039;s animation looks if you compair it with modern anime a bit dated, but hey, it&#039;s from 1997. It&#039;s about the same age when Pokémon (1997) came out in Japan as an anime, so I wouldn&#039;t make a fuss that much for it&#039;s animation. It&#039;s pretty OK. I&#039;ve seen much worse animation, so no real complaints on the animation part aswell. Sure, I&#039;ve spotted here and there some animation errors, but hey, I won&#039;t bitch and moan about that.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
Ayane is voiced by Yuko Miyamura, the person that also voiced the quite famous 14 year old Asuka Langley Souryuu from the Evangelion series. That combined with pretty alright background music that really kind of gives the vibes of the 90&#039;s together with decent voice acting from the other and sound effect typical for the &#039;90&#039;s, I really can&#039;t complain sound-wise. Maybe I could make make a comment that the assigned intro song for this anime should have been &quot;Fight For Yourself&quot; by The Street Beats, which is a Jpop song that I actually don&#039;t really like, but hey, music taste does vary aswell.<br />
<br />
Charather: 5/10 (Average)<br />
It&#039;s kind of a sad thing thing I really can&#039;t judge with only two episodes that ever made for this series if I want to talk about it&#039;s charathers. You really need more episodes to see the charathers more fleshed out to be honest, even for an anime that was intented to be aired on television. That&#039;s why I go the average route if I want to rate the charathers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyement: 7/10 (Good)<br />
I actually felt bummed out the two episodes were over already. I honesty wanted more. I sort of want to know if Ayane would have succeeded her dream to become a pro wrestler even after she went the kickboxing route. Let&#039;s assume she did. Still I low key want to see all the shenanigans she has gone trough to acchieve her goal. As I already said before; someone please build a time machine and go back to 1997 to sponser this project.<br />
<br />
Overal: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
I honesty would recommend this short anime. It&#039;s only two episodes long that could get completed within the hour. I think this short cancelled anime is a good example that the lack of funding and/or intrest totally can destroy a potentional good series forever. <br />

    If there was ever a title that I would consider to be missed potential then it would have to be Ayane&#039;s High Kick. This very short series deserved a much longer run, because inside of this short OVA there&#039;s a story just screaming to be let out. Ayane&#039;s High Kick begins with a bit of promise, and it soon shows sparks of what it could have been, but it eventually falls victim to the low budget.<br />
<br />
Fighting anime will normally follow a certain pattern. 1)Main character trains hard. 2)Main character fights very tough opponent and is driven to the brink of defeat. 3)Main character some how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192316">
        defeats said opponent that they normally shouldn&#039;t with lady luck on their side: This anime isn&#039;t really different as it follows that same pattern for the most part, but it&#039;s still kind of fun as you watch the main character try to overcome the obstacles.<br />
<br />
The characters have very little to no depth and most fall in stereotypical roles, but it&#039;s still hard not to cheer for Ayane. Her clumsiness is classic and works well with the comedy. I couldn&#039;t help wonder how a die hard fan of pro wrestling did not notice she wasn&#039;t training for it. Is this dumb or what? She gives all wrestling fans a very bad name, but her clueless behaviour and excuses to get herself out of trouble adds the cuteness to her.<br />
<br />
Ayane&#039;s High Kick isn&#039;t completely about the next fight. There are also sub plots taking place concerning the vice principal of her school, which furthers the anime stereotype of vice principals being evil. Ayane&#039;s school has a rule that forbids violent extracurricular activities. After her participation in a match, the vice principal is dead set on getting her expelled. She also has to keep her training secret from her mother. So there&#039;s a little bit extra going on here adding to the suspense. Unfortunately, because of the short length only one is well used.<br />
<br />
The animation is decent for such a short OVA. The action scenes are fun, but suffer from the overuse of stills and reused animation. The artwork is ok at times with nice character designs, however it can be inconsistent also. This is very noticeable during the fights because the characters almost appear to be stick figures at times. The soundtrack is ok, and it fits with the personalities of the characters. On the downside, some of the songs are constantly replayed and the over exposure caused them to over stay their welcome. The English cast is alright for the most part, but Rose Markisello whom plays Sakurako Miyagawa speaks with too heavy of an accent when pronouncing her character&#039;s name. It actually grated on my nerves quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that I have with this series is the very short length. Not only because the series left me wanting more, it also heavily effected the storytelling. Switching from wrestling to kick boxing is a huge transition as well as difficult. There could have been a great story told here with plenty of character development. Watching this character grow and prosper from beginner to pro could have propelled this series into classic status. The best example of a beginner turning pro while dealing with the hardships of a physical sport would be Fighting Spirit aka Hajime No Ippo; but then again, perhaps my imagination is just running wild here.<br />
<br />
Ayane&#039;s High Kick is definitely wasted potential, and I really hope it gets picked up for a remake up one day. Ayane is an interesting character in a story that could have been very good but a weak anime is still a weak anime. It shouldn&#039;t have seen the light of day. The series feels badly rushed and the opened ending will leave everyone wanting more. This is an OVA I can&#039;t recommend at all; but the good thing is, the anime genre is over-saturated with action titles. So finding a better one won&#039;t be hard at all. <br />
<br />
Highs: Decent action scenes and music, light hearted and fun<br />
<br />
Lows: Too short and incredibly rushed

    Ayane-chan High Kick is a sports comedy from the late 90s. It was written by Shizuya Isao and put out by Nikkatsu &amp; Rikuentai. I&#039;ve reviewed a lot of semi obscure OVAs so let&#039;s delve into this one. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
We open with our heroine, Mitsui Ayane, skipping school in order to try out for wrestling. Unfortunately for her, throwing herself into things carelessly doesn&#039;t work out and she isn&#039;t signed. But things look up when she&#039;s approached by Tange Kunimitsu who sees championship potential in her. She eagerly takes him up on his offer to train her, not realising that he actually wants her as a kick boxer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294505">
        rather than as a wrestler. <br />
<br />
The biggest issue with the OVA comes down to the humour. To explain it in simple terms, it can&#039;t decide whether it wants over the top, absurd comedy or more subdued dry comedy. Which basically results in it giving you kind of absurd, over the top situations and then reeling things back and giving you a subdued punch line that usually proves a bit disappointing. Having Ayane woken up when she&#039;s sleeping in class by her friend doing a countdown could be really funny, if she let loose and decked the student in the desk next to hers. Not so much when she just stands up awkwardly and shouts. That&#039;s just a little funny. Having the antagonist bring a van to her school and challenge her would be really funny if she gave a kind of exaggerated challenge speech like the Ultimate Warrior but it&#039;s not really funny when she&#039;s just a bit haughty. <br />
<br />
Another issue is with how much time they spend on training montages where nothing all that amusing happens. I get it, you have a sports thing so you want to show some training and progression. However, this OVA has two episodes and runs for a little less than an hour. So, spending a bunch of that time showing training doesn&#039;t seem particularly prudent when you could have some jokes for your comedy or character development if you want to take it semi-seriously. Or both. <br />
<br />
With those critiques out of the way, I will credit the series for being kind of entertaining and having jokes that might not be uproariously funny but are a bit funny. And there&#039;s nothing in the OVA&#039;s writing that&#039;s actually bad or even boring. Its main problems come down to trying to do too much with limited time and a general unwillingness to commit to the more absurd elements. And the worst that&#039;s going to lead to are some scenes that are a bit &quot;blah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
I&#039;ve often said that a comedic work doesn&#039;t need characters with all that much depth so long as it has characters that have strong comedic interactions, although it is a bonus. That being said, this OVA isn&#039;t solely comedic. It takes its sport elements somewhat seriously and, because of that, I would say it needs some depth. Which it really doesn&#039;t have. Even if this were purely comedic most of the characters aren&#039;t all that funny in their interactions. So, you ultimately end up with characters who are a a bit too flat to make for a good cast in a sports work that&#039;s taking itself somewhat seriously and not animated enough for a strong comedic cast. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The artwork isn&#039;t all that good. It&#039;s not bad either it&#039;s just kind of average 90s fare in terms of character designs, backgrounds and the like. The biggest issue I had with it were with the action sequences. The OVA opts for more pulse pounding action rather than absurd, over the top action. Which is a perfectly acceptable choice but the problem is that it&#039;s not good at it. The action sequences mostly involve Ayane taking hits with flashes and recycled footage before she pulls it together and delivers her devastating titular high kick and it&#039;s just not that exciting or interesting to watch. And when it tries to illustrate injuries, there&#039;s really no detail so it just doesn&#039;t work. I get not wanting to show too much blood or detailed gore in a comedic sports work but at least give us some bruising or anything that can actually convey the damage they&#039;re supposed to have taken. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The acting is fine. Nishihara Kumiko, Miyamura Yuko, Kawamura Maria &amp; Ootsuka Akio all deliver acceptable performances. I dare say they could&#039;ve done better if they&#039;d had stronger comedy and/or stronger characterisation to work with. The music is okay. Not anything spectacular or super memorable but it works well enough. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
There&#039;s a bit between Ayane and Kayoko. When they start talking about graduating together and Ayane realises she has to win her match for that purpose it gets pretty homo-erotic. <br />
<br />
Specific Improvement Suggestions:<br />
This is something new I&#039;ll probably do from this point on. Namely, I&#039;m going to suggest three specific changes that I think could have made for a stronger work. Obviously, it&#039;s going to end up being a lot easier with works that aren&#039;t as good and get more nit-picky when you get something really strong, but I think it&#039;ll be interesting. So, for this OVA here are my picks. <br />
1. Embracing more absurd humour. <br />
I&#039;m not opposed to drier, more subdued comedy, but with the ridiculous set ups and situations I definitely think going for more zany, over the top japes would have made for stronger comedy.<br />
<br />
2. Cutting The Training sequences down, using that time for character interactions.<br />
If the OVA had done a bit more with developing strong comedic interactions, I definitely think the characters would be both stronger and more memorable.<br />
<br />
3. More polish for the action sequences.<br />
Whether you want to keep the pulse pounding action, or you want to keep with the general motif and make the fight sequences more ridiculous, the action sequences definitely need more effort.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
Ayane-chan High Kick is all right. It&#039;s certainly better than some of the random OVAs I&#039;ve gone over but there are also plenty of better ones out there. If it sounds like it might be your thing, you won&#039;t lose much time watching it since it does run for less than an hour and you may enjoy it. But if you skip it you aren&#039;t really missing out on anything. I&#039;ll give it a 6/10. <br />

    Anyway I tend to watch a lot of things and this one is a short two episode OVA and its called<br />
Ayane&#039;s High Kick<br />
With a title like that don&#039;t expect a romantic drama and it isn&#039;t. Its one of them fighting animes that I tend to like. Now this one was made in 1996 so don&#039;t expect it to be a looker by today&#039;s standards. I have to say it has a female lead character that must be slightly dim as she seems to be easily fooled into thinking that she doing wrestling training in kick boxing gear (ok there have been ones in the past

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23002">
        that have worn kick boxing gear) but when the trainer takes her to a gym for it you would think she would clock on to it but she doesn&#039;t. <br />
There is however room for a possibly series but considering it was made over ten years ago I don&#039;t think they will.<br />
The thing its self doesn&#039;t take its self to seriously but its sadly not that funny (well not to me) but it is okish so.<br />
Over all<br />
I give this 3/5 as its kinda something id pick up if it was on the cheap.<br />
Recommended for -<br />
People that like to watch this type of anime and want something short and back to basics.<br />
Plot in one sentence -<br />
Girl wants to become wrestler ends up becoming a kick boxer.<br />

    Sadly this only got 2 episodes, if it got more, my rating would have probably been much different. There just wasn&#039;t enough time for the story, albeit in the 2 episodes everything was established and executed quite well.<br />
<br />
Story: 4 <br />
<br />
I gave it a 4 mainly because of the ending, That was a BS doctor stoppage, I know the studio could have given the anime 5 more minutes to really finish the fight.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
Not much to say, I&#039;m just a big fan of the old  aesthetic present in the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
I liked the ED, but the OP was awful. The soundtracks were just average, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313849">
        something I&#039;ll ever remember either.<br />
<br />
Characters: 4 <br />
<br />
The only 2 likeable characters, were Ayane and her Coach - everyone else was either annoying or just boring like Kayako.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6<br />
<br />
I would recommend it to people who like fighting anime I guess, the fight scenes were pretty cool. I enjoyed it, though I was shorter than I hoped.

    In my search for a good sports anime with mainly female characters that would actually be worth watching, I came across &quot;Ayane High Kick&quot; and thought it sounded fun.  After searching and searching until I found both episodes (dubbed in English, no less!), I finally watched it, and I thought I might as well explain this obscure anime about a kickboxer girl.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 - fair<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t BAD, I will say that.  I actually kind of liked the idea of a girl who wants to be a wrestler but just can&#039;t make it in that world, so a kickboxing coach who sees the potential

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357386">
        in her strong and flexible legs decides to start training her to enter the world of competitive kickboxing.  Sounds really cool, right?  Well, the anime didn&#039;t develop the story as well as I had hoped it would, and everything just seemed kind of rushed and sudden.  Like, Ayane fails her wrestling tryout.  Boom!  Suddenly a guy wants to train her.  She trains.  Bam!  Suddenly a famous hotshot kickboxer gets mad &#039;cause Ayane stole the spotlight.  Just snap your fingers and something new is happening - that&#039;s how rushed the two episodes were.  <br />
<br />
Art: 6/10 - fair<br />
<br />
Since this anime is really, really old, I can&#039;t really judge it with the same standards as I would a more modern show, but I will say, the animation wasn&#039;t as jerky and awkward as I had expected it to be, considering how old it is, and I actually thought the character designs were pretty decent.  All the characters are drawn in a thickly outlined, high-contrast sort of style, with blocky highlights on their skin and clothes and VERY exaggerated hair (for the female characters).  Their exaggerated facial expressions and designs, though, are part of what I kind of liked: it was easy to tell how a character was feeling just by looking at them.  Overall, I think the art was nothing too special, but it was tough-looking enough to fit with the theme of the show and fun-looking enough to fit the tone of the show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10 - decent<br />
<br />
The sound was probably the worst aspect of the show, but it wasn&#039;t completely and entirely terrible.  I watched the English dub, and the voice acting was pretty bad - all the characters besides Ayane and Kunimitsu (and even them, too, but for them it was the least annoying) sounded very robotic and fake.  The VAs didn&#039;t put much emotion into their voices and it was really obvious they were reading off a script.  It was impossible to feel the hype of the fight scenes or the tender emotion of Ayane and Kayoko promising to graduate together because of the so-obviously-fake voices.  I did manage to find the first episode in Japanese, and the voices were definitely better in that version (probably since it&#039;s the original), so I didn&#039;t rate the sound &quot;poor&quot; simply because of that.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of sound in the show is the music.  The anime creators did better with the music than with the voice acting, for sure, but even the music was pretty forgettable and not very interesting or exciting.  I&#039;ve watched some anime with soundtracks that make fantastic emotions swell up inside me and that make me visualize the scenes in my mind even if I&#039;m not watching the anime (Haikyuu!! has one of the BEST soundtrack - if you want an anime with good music, be sure to check it out!), but Ayane High Kick didn&#039;t have that.  I don&#039;t know much about how music works, but I do know that the soundtrack to this anime was pretty boring and only had a couple minutes that I can recall that were actually done well.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10 - good<br />
<br />
Despite the bad dub voices, I actually liked the characters.  I loved Ayane&#039;s strong spirit and competitive energy.  I liked how sweet and loyal Kayoko was to her best friend.  I liked that Kunimitsu pushed Ayane hard and helped her train just as he would have with a boy.  Ayane and Kayoko&#039;s classmate (I forgot his name, sadly) was also quite fun, and I liked that the anime didn&#039;t push him into a romantic relationship with one of the girls, because that would have added yet another new event and there wouldn&#039;t have been as much focus on kickboxing.  Ayane&#039;s little brother was one of the most realistic characters in the show, and I thought he added a bit of cute comedy to it.  The vice-principal was annoying because of how &quot;evil&quot; he was made out to be, and I think everything would have been much better off without him.  The worst character was Sakuragawa (I think that&#039;s what her name was...), the blond, high-ponytailed &quot;princess&quot; kickboxer.  She was one of the most cliche characters and was just so unrealistic in her behavior that it made the whole story even less believable. Overall, the characters were not too bad, and if anybody does watch Ayane High Kick, do it for the characters.  The spirited Ayane is a good protagonist, who, no matter how many times she&#039;s hit and kicked and thrown to the ground, never gives up and keeps fighting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6/10 - fair<br />
<br />
It was fun.  It was a little bland and it failed to get me hyped up, but it was nice to see an old anime about a mostly-tough girl and her discovery of a new sport.  It wasn&#039;t a very exciting anime, but if it got a modern remake, I would definitely want to see it.  There were a few funny parts, and a few sweet parts, and some potentially interesting fight scenes, so it wasn&#039;t that bad.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10 - fair<br />
<br />
As I said before, it wasn&#039;t too bad, but it&#039;s not the hidden, magnificent gem of ancient, obscure anime.  It makes sense why it never gained much popularity, but it had some potential.  It had its good points and its bad points, so I can&#039;t say it was fantastic, but it wasn&#039;t horrible.  &quot;Fair&quot; is the best description for Ayane High Kick, an anime with potential that never managed to make it far enough.  And that&#039;s a shame, since the story could have been fleshed out more and the characters could have been developed so much more.  My main takeaway from this anime is simple: the only person that can force you to stay down is yourself.  That&#039;s why Ayane kept getting up.  She never stayed down because she was in charge, meaning she could always choose to use those legs of hers and pull out another &quot;Golden High Kick.&quot;<br />

    Okokokok HEAR ME OUT. This is a VERY short anime. I went in completely blind and surprise surprise it was absolutely nothing new- but. It was honestly pretty enjoyable in the background. I was half watching half working but I was listening the entire time- It was honestly a lot of fun. There were a few intentional jokes that landed for me and I really don&#039;t think this show took itself seriously. <br />
