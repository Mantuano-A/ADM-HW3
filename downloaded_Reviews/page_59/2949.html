Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is a cute lighthearted run of the mill isekai fantasy anime. The main character is a lazy stay at home high school girl who is transported to the world of a game she plays. She is forced to wear a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361775">
        bear costume, all her magic is bear related spells and her summons are cute bears of course. The thing I like about Yuna the most is she is very relatable and honest. Although Yuna is able to do a lot of things through her magic she stills needs help from others and she builds many relationships along the way. I really recommend if you like lighthearted fantasy anime or slice of life. Its by no means a masterpiece but I love this show. Also as a bonus the ending song is really good. This was my first review and I am not very good at them but i tried. <br />

    Sunk cost fallacy is a peculiar thing. When presented with a show I know wasn&#039;t going to get better, somehow some psychological effects in my brain kept telling me to soldier on and to see it to the end of this frankly mediocre as hell show. And by the tail end of it I was exhausted by it all and I&#039;m here right now to tell you why you shouldn&#039;t be like me and waste your time on this. After reviewing so many shows for close to a decade, I&#039;ve found it most difficult to articulate why a show is boring or mediocre as opposed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369415">
        to being plain bad. And that&#039;s the thing, on the surface Kumax3 Bear is reasonably competent. The artstyle is fine, the girls are cute, nothing is particularly wrong about any aspect of it, and I&#039;m the person who&#039;s willing to find some value in even the most broken of shows. Kumax3 Bear doesn&#039;t give me any material to work with at all. <br />
<br />
Kumax3 Bear is an isekai, but one more focused on SoL than adventure or existential dread. I do enjoy slow paced SoL shows, but even if we do focus on that one aspect of Kumax4, it&#039;s still unable to deliver since the show does go out of its way to intersperse poorly written and very tonally contradicting drama into its show. It really reminds me of last year&#039;s Average Abilities Show (which by the way was below average) where the show wants you to care about its characters and world, but no one is particularly likable in the slightest when all of the show&#039;s conflicts can be solved easily with Yuna&#039;s bear powers (which the show also never shuts up about even after the nth time it&#039;s established). This is not to say drama or conflict has no place in an SoL, but it&#039;s just handled so poorly here. In order to have good drama and conflict, the viewer has to bond with at least someone from the main cast in order to empathize with the cast&#039;s plight, otherwise everyone comes off as some whiney jackass who needlessly antagonizes our main character for no good reason.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no real reason to be particularly connected with the main character or anyone else for that matter in the show. Yuna is your typical trapped in isekai protagonist with OP powers (just bear themed this time) and no real gimmick beyond the bear theme. She&#039;s bland as bland can be, bringing in her modern world knowledge and OP bear powers to solve whatever problems she meets or is tasked with. Alongside her is Fina, her companion of sorts who occasionally follows her to bear witness to her impressive feats and do very little otherwise. Apart from that out of nowhere and definitely unearned yuri confession at the very end of the series, I see no reason why Fina would suddenly be so infatuated with her. The character interactions, or lack of thereof, is really poor in comparison with other similar Girl meets Girl show, and that scene right there at the end just shocked me for how sudden it was. There is no buildup, no development, no growth in characterization for these two.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase internet superstar Rich Evans, I will use the following quote to describe the comedy in this series.<br />
&quot;There are jokes that make you laugh, okay? And then there are jokes that you have no reaction to. But every now and then there&#039;s a joke so bad, it makes you less laugh. Like, you&#039;ll just be sitting there normal, and then the joke will happen, and then you&#039;ll slightly less smile, even though you weren&#039;t smiling. And that is called Non-medy.&quot;<br />
But really the attempts at humour are abysmal. The &quot;Oh look is that a bear?!&quot; joke was never funny the first time and it sure isn&#039;t funny the 100th time. As is the required by law &quot;Isekai Culture Shock&quot; gags and the &quot;Soy sauce? Miso? GOHAN?&quot; food observations that really make you wanna pause the show and ponder what went wrong with your life choices to be watching a show this mediocre 10+ episodes in just to bear witness to that observation.<br />
<br />
Kumax4 isn&#039;t the worst thing I&#039;ve watched this season (that dishonour goes to Maesetsu, a show so boring I actually had to physically stop myself from watching it), but given I had to sit through its mediocrity for about 5 of my Earth hours, I leave with this warning to not touch the show in any capacity unless you have a penchant for boring shows or if you need some sleeping aid. <br />
<br />
4/10 (How the hell is this getting a second season)

    With the global pandemic going on around the world right now, there’s one form of entertainment that is satisfying for millions and millions of people around the world: video games. Specifically, RPG of the MMORPG genre are real time sinks. We find out the easy way once 15-year old Yuna is introduced to the show. As an adventurer in the online game, World Fantasy Online, she is best described as the typical nerd at home.<br />
<br />
Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is exactly what it sounds like. What it advertises is what you get and that is our main character dressed up in a bear outfit. It may

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369378">
        seem like a peculiar trend but with the countless amount of fantasy shows in recent years, nothing surprises me anymore. Coming into this anime gave me the impression of playing a video game as we follow Yuna on her fantasy adventure. And here’s the catcher: Yuna enjoys her life in this new world more so than the real world.<br />
<br />
World Fantasy Online is perhaps the most generic sounding game I’ve ever heard of. It’s taking the three most oversaturated words of the isekai genre and put them all in one basket. And as expected, the game itself has a colorful world setting of creatures, NPCs, characters, and of course, Yuma in a bear outfit. Despite the anime seemingly throwing everything to you at once, it’s actually pretty easy to figure out where Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is headed. The premise follows the plot and doesn’t take deep understanding to figure out the show altogether.<br />
<br />
First off, there’s Yuna, the 15-year old poster girl who is carrying this show in her bear outfit. Like most teenagers, gaming is part of her hobby but she takes it to an obsessive level. There’s charm about her character despite this unhealthy hobby because let’s face it, she’s nerdy on the outside but adorably cute on the inside. Watching Yuna solving problems such as dealing with roaming monsters in the wild, discovering treasures, or collecting certain objects reminds me of modern JRPGs. Only here, Yuna doesn’t have a main questline to get through to beat the game. At least from this anime’s plot, she’s free and builds her own life in this virtual world. And because she is so free, Yuna has come to love World Fantasy Online and the gaming culture. <br />
<br />
Make no mistake. Yuna’s no pushover when getting work done especially when judging on her combat skills. It’s actually amusing once you witness her feats in the show. Fighting monsters seems more like an annoying chore for her than an actual challenge. The anime built her character to be powerful, and by powerful, she is pretty much unrivaled throughout all her fights. I could go on to list her achievements but you’ll have to see to believe it. The bottom line is, Yuna is more than just unbearably cute. She’s a selfless girl that has the personality of a teen but also with heart of gold. She even forms some important relationships with others such as Fina and Noire. While on her adventure, you can see more of Yuna’s real personality when she interacts with these characters.<br />
<br />
With the show’s cour length being just 12 episodes, there’s concern about how the studio would handle the adaptation. Honestly, stuffing over 15+ volumes into a single cour is never a favorable impression when you know the juicy part of the franchise lies in the light novels. That being said, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear does have a smooth pacing and flows on its own as a story. With every episode, we discover that World Fantasy Online can be a dangerous place to other adventurers. There’s monsters, bandits, and other creatures roaming around that can kill, rob, eat, and commit all sorts of sins you can imagine. Remember, it’s a fantasy story and common logic is often thrown out the window. Yuna herself represents a defiance of common sense. I mean, just asking yourself this question: how can a little girl of her size in a beat outfit be so damn overpowered?<br />
<br />
Limiting the anime to 12-episodes did set off red flags but thankfully is tolerable as you can enjoy the show for more than its length. Comedy wise, this show loves its recurring gags specifically with other characters making fun of Yuna’s bear outfit. She herself even realizes how ridiculous it looks despite the overwhelming stat advantages. Studio EMT Squared and the director designed her in such a way to sell the show’s appeal. It creates many moments of charming chemistry between the cast. The world setting itself is designed to reflect fantasy elements with the castles, dangerous creatures, and oversized bears. Even if you’re not a bear fanatic, there’s no doubt the show wanted you to experience its world.<br />
<br />
I’m sure everyone can agree that we have way too many fantasy anime every season. Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear may seem like a clone with some added twist but deep down, this is still a charming anime. Without a complex story or characterization, we are presented with a show about a girl in a bear outfit enjoying her fantasy life. Life isn’t easy in the real world but Yuna makes it look like a piece of cake in her own world.

    Every season must have a generic &quot;girls only&quot; moe blob show and also some generic isekai power fantasy show. If you are fan of either of those then you can rejoice because this show combines both of them into the most painfully mediocre show you can imagine. <br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Pretty much standard moe art, nothing offensive, nothing special. Fights were decently animated, CGI is ok-ish.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Only decent thing about this show. Both OP and ED are nice, voice acting is fine too.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
There is almost none. It&#039;s your average CGDCT crossed into isekai power fantasy with grossly overpower MC. Things happen only for the sole reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363187">
        of MC being able to flex how awesome her powers are. The little quirk of bear theme can&#039;t build a story by itself.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2<br />
Nonexistent aside from the MC. Every other character exists either so they can fawn over the MC or to be a comically bad fodder villain.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; overall experience: 3<br />
UnBEARable to watch... I&#039;ll let myself out...

    Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear - Bears are cute. <br />
<br />
What would you do with your life after earning billions of yen in stocks? Our 15 years old girl Yuna confines herself to her house playing the world&#039;s first VRMMO. One day, after taking a survey in the game, she receives a bear costume without any clues where, why, what to do as a bear. But she quickly recognizes the power of bears and uses it to help people in need. And so, the story of our heroic kuma begins.<br />
<br />
Real life sucks. Well…this is a point that we often cannot deny. Our main character Yuna also has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369389">
        the same view and thus her journey in the fantasy world begins. She meets friends there that she really likes. Every day she experiences new adventures with them together. The poor in need are helped by her power and the limit of the evil dukes are finally shown. <br />
How does she make all of this possible? The answer is the bear costume. This present item has definitely cheat powers and can literally beat anything and anyone. Shortly after arriving the fantasy world, she saves a young cute girl named Fina from a pack of monsters. You can feel the harmony between the two girls and see that they get along perfectly. Fina guides her through the small down and after discovering the Adventures Guild, Yuna has found her destiny. She will become an adventure and fight against the evil! From an adventure without rank, she climbs them faster than lightning. <br />
<br />
Yuna is initially presented as a lazy, carefree and lonely NEET. Real life simply sucks in her opinion. She also doesn&#039;t care about the opinions from other people, she is doing the things she loves. Despite her somewhat anti-social demeanour, Yuna is exceptionally kind and has a certain sense of justice. She also shows a soft side towards the people she loves like Fina or Fina&#039;s imouto Shuri.<br />
Fina is the person saved by Yuna, not from the monsters only but everything. Meeting Yuna was the best thing could happen to her. With her help, Fina&#039;s mother recovered from her illness as well. Despite her young age (10), she already knows how to take care of her family. But not only Fina&#039;s world changed because of Yuna, instead also Yuna&#039;s view about the people who she really cares got in a positive way.<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of the CGDCT genre in general, you will like the style here for sure. All the girls are shown very cute. Yuna&#039;s life becomes more colorful through this world, which is also well represented. It is colorful and you can feel her happiness through the bright and beautiful colors. The scenes are also well animated, even those where a little fight takes place.<br />
<br />
The OP song “Itsuka no Kioku” is performed by our cute Fina aka Azumi Waki. She is also known as part of the legendary Blend S OP &quot;Bon Appétit ♡ S&quot; where she voices Maika. You can feel how happy Fina is meeting Yuna-oneechan from the music and the lyrics. She is the one who saved not only her but also her whole family and brought them the joy they deserve.  <br />
But what really stays in your head is the ED song &quot;Ano ne&quot; sung by Yuna (Maki Kawase). Maybe one or the other will still remember the &quot;anone anone&quot; from the Platelets (Hataraku Saibou – Cells at Work!), which is also just too cute. We saw your stories with happiness, Yuna. With this song she shows that she would do everything to protect this world and her friends. It is a place where she is accepted and feels home.<br />
<br />
Although I am a huge CGDCT fan, I was a bit skeptical after the first few episodes. I have to admit that I found the bear costume a bit strange at the beginning. I would love to see Yuna more without it to be honest. I like her casual outfit much more. But gradually I got used to it and it didn’t bother me anymore. What really fascinates me is Yuna&#039;s attitude how much she is willing to help the poor and vulnerable people without expecting anything in return. I hope especially for Fina, Schuri and their family they can have a great time now, those two young ladies deserved it. <br />
Relax a little, just lean back and enjoy the adventures with our bears! See how a 15-year-old girl save the world and put smiles on people&#039;s faces again.<br />
I hope we will see more adventures with our kuma in the future as well! <br />

    We had SAO. Then we had Spring 2020&#039;s Bofuri, which takes the former&#039;s inspiration and gives it a light-hearted, cutesy &quot;moe blob&quot; twist. Now welcome to the next level with the mish-mash of both shows, and you&#039;ll get the result (that is) Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear. KUMA??? GAO~~~<br />
<br />
The Isekai power-fantasy genre has always been confined in a state of amassed &quot;love-hate&quot; relationships over the years since the introduction of Reki Kawahara&#039;s hugely popular LN series (that still to this day gets a bad rap), and many novelists have attempted to compose their own &quot;unique twists&quot; to varying degrees of successes and failures. It&#039;s not until

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369381">
        fairly recently that there has been a resurgence with the &quot;moe blob&quot; twist, starting from Bofuri (which has the overly-cliche OP character, but relatable and fun in every way). And you can take everything about that show and apply it here, not forgetting to add the ever-so-popular bear-ish CGDCT genre for an even intriguing adventure of a pure, laid-back relaxation and enjoyment in a traditional VRMMORPG-like environment.<br />
<br />
Forget what you remember of the tropes and clichés of similar shows in the past, and come along for this ride that is anything but typical. A stereotypical OP character, stemming from her lazy-bum personality who became a NEET at age 12, and never wanting to go back to the real world? Now that&#039;s something you don&#039;t hear much, and the atypical 15-year-old Yuna is just that. Being transported into the Isekai world, forced to be clothed in a black-or-white unBEARablely costume suit helming bear-able magic attacks, along with adorable and fluffy summoned beasts (white Kumakyuu and black Kumayuru), this is the adventurous story of Yuna travelling in spades, while giving off entirely different impressions of a &quot;heroic&quot; OP MC character (mostly being embarrassingly noticed because she&#039;s a donning a bear onesie), interacting with townspeople and imparting some assets of the real world to surprise them with wonderous mind-boggling awe. Oh, and make the &quot;House of Kuma&quot; and cook up Japanese food, just because she can and has real-world withdrawals of nostalgia to recreate.<br />
<br />
The immediate thing about Yuna (as is with Bofuri&#039;s Maple) is that more than just being relatable, she&#039;s not trying to be over-pretentious about the various situations of encounters in her journey, be it wild monster battles or exacting her sweet, sweet revenge (of Kuma attacks, Jojo style) on greedy and heartless people that take advantage of oppressing common folk in simple one-note circumstances, giving a mix of both light and dark undertones for a competent and balanced story plot structure (unlike Slime Otoko&#039;s). That&#039;s not to say that she goes through this journey alone, as the growing and budding relationships with other characters (well, mostly &quot;moe blob&quot; lolis) makes for a somewhat conventional journey, even much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Take for example, Yuna&#039;s first friend: 10-year-old loli, Fina. Living together with her younger sister Shuri and their single mother Tiermina, she is the sole breadwinner of the poverty-strickened family, and forced to take care of the family&#039;s circumstances, molding her character development of both responsibility and maturity at a young age (which accounts for her abnormal mentality of such a young child). It&#039;s not until another the Adventure Guild staff member (Uncle) Gentz does the family&#039;s happiness really takes off, and having a stepfather helps in the family&#039;s growth as well. Nice one.<br />
<br />
Along with the other characters that come in toll as the series progresses (from a single-family and an orphanage to royalty), more than just the &quot;coincidental&quot; blessings in disguise, Yuna learns a lot about the meaning of life, being true-to-honest about her own reflections of her past in the real world and living the best out of the current times. I love stuff like these that just speaks to my heart-strings, and gives me the inspiration and perseverance to keep on living (and so should yours too).<br />
<br />
Director Yuu Nobuta helms this anime project over at low-budget studio EMT Squared, and rightaway source readers see this as a &quot;disappointing adaptation&quot;, due to the fact that Episode 1 was pre-screened early (started by yours truly), garnering mixed feelings from both source readers and anime-onlys due to the weird choice of pacing and the sub-par animation quality (that spawned spoilers for irrefutable reasons, that you can blame series composer Takashi Aoshima). Despite all the hoopla for a shaky start, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear slowly but eventually found its footing and from thereon, started the progress of a fast-paced recovery that only got consistently better as time passes. Also, no matter how simplistic the visuals feel with the tag-along low-quality animation that the studio is known for, it never once feels drab and out of place, but instead creates a colourful, vibrant world that matches an imperfect-but-wonderful background setting.<br />
<br />
The OST is about as lively as you&#039;d expect of the familiar nature of CGDCT shows, and is more of the same in that regard. Both Azumi Waki&#039;s OP and Yuna&#039;s VA Maki Kawase&#039;s ED may sound quite shallow, but they sound really nice and energetic, which also gives Kuma Bear the sizable competency of a good OP/ED pairing in a season of high-quality ones.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve been looking for the seasonal &quot;LN Isekai power fantasy adaptation&quot; cliche that IS worth watching, this is for you. This anime is by no means a masterpiece (nor even a mediocre) work, but getting a mid-range sized character cast with the lore of just enjoying a likeable OP MC rage her black-and-white fists in a world accepting the ways of &quot;Miss Bear&quot;, that&#039;s saying a lot for a show that I&#039;d recommend for those of you who can just turn off your brains and let loose the unBEARableness.<br />
<br />
Underrated show this is not, but it&#039;s at least worth a watch. *Nipah-like* KUMA~~~

    so it&#039;s pretty early to write a review but I can hardly see the show growing much past what it is now. so here&#039;s a quick TLDR: enjoyable fluff show with no stakes. It&#039;s cute and nice to just turn your brain off to.<br />
<br />
on to the somewhat longer review. Potential spoilers ahead. this is written after episode 4.<br />
<br />
story: 6<br />
generic sent into another world type deal. the character has no real grounding in the original world. ill the story so far is cute fluff with any issues solved by the bear outfit. <br />
<br />
art: 7 <br />
It&#039;s a nice cute palette with your average animation I can&#039;t really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361782">
        notice anything janky or weird about it but nor is it amazing its just nice. <br />
<br />
sound: 6 <br />
I&#039;m not much of an ost guy but the opening is eh and the outro is nice and cute but nothing really noteworthy.<br />
<br />
character: 5<br />
all relatively flat cute characters, your probably noticing a reoccurring point in this review and that being cute, and that&#039;s because that&#039;s all the show has going for it it&#039;s cute.<br />
<br />
enjoyment: 8<br />
I&#039;m actually enjoying this it&#039;s just low effort time filler I&#039;m not hyped for every episode but nor am I like ugh another episode is out, let&#039;s get this over with.<br />
It&#039;s nice to just watch without really caring too much.<br />
<br />
overall: 6 <br />
<br />
if you are after a low effort  (and I don&#039;t mean production-wise or whatever I mean in terms of effort put in from you) then watch this its nice chill no stakes cute op bear solves everything. I mean episode 4 the mum is dying and Kuma-san goes &quot;I just need to imagine harder!&quot; and solves it.<br />
her powers are pretty much capped by saying bear and imagining some dumb crap<br />
<br />
so show ended and yknow it was just as ok as it always was chill cute bear does cute op bear stuff<br />
(if i remember correctly it got season 2 right? so I guess that&#039;s hype?)

    There isn&#039;t a lot to be really said when it comes to Kuma Kuma. Not in a bad sense at all, nor does it make it bad. But more so far, it seems a bit chill, a bit on the relaxing side. There is a sense of mystery behind it with it&#039;s premise. But so far, we haven&#039;t dived into that so much, besides finding out what basically works. Which is fine for the show.<br />
<br />
The show drops us off into seeing our MC in action, showing us just who she is, and what the bear suit is capable of. Though it does feel a little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review361766">
        disjointed, all because of it being episode 1, and then ep2 starts off explaining things. It&#039;s a bit confusing at first glance, you may think you&#039;ve ended up in ep 6, rather than 1. But it does a job in showing you what is what I suppose.<br />
<br />
As for the story itself, think like Goblin Slayer in terms of an adventures guild, with all kinds of jobs that one can take, with a ranking system. But it&#039;s not just that when it comes to the story, as I said, there is a sense of mystery, as this isn&#039;t no isekai, or least it believes it&#039;s not, it&#039;s a game. So one can wonder who is behind the game, and what their goal is. It&#039;s pretty interesting to say the least. I&#039;m expecting it to get more interesting as it goes along.<br />
<br />
As for the characters themselves, we&#039;ve seen a fair few, with our MC in Yuna getting more of the spotlight, and just being chill and fun, but also quite the wonderer when it comes to everything that is going on. The other that&#039;s had more focus is Fina, who is a delight and a sweeite. I&#039;m sure more will pop up as we go along, but fairly decent cast so far.<br />
<br />
Same can be said for the sound and art of this show. The art is colourful, and pretty. There are some dark tones when needed, but most of it is a more pretty kind that seems more friendly. While the sound is fitting for each scene. <br />
<br />
Should you give it a shot? Sure! It&#039;s looking decent so far, it won&#039;t be anime of the season, but it&#039;s certainly a good show. Give it a go.

    This show is basically 3 different shows combined into one. not in a good way.<br />
<br />
It starts off as you expect. video gamer gets isekai&#039;d to fantasy world with OP videogame powers. typical premise. the first few episodes are about her learning the world and her abilities. saving people by beating up monsters for the adventurer&#039;s guild. again, expected. The main problem in this part is that Yuna does it all with the soulessness of a puppet. Zero personality. Perhaps she&#039;s an autist.<br />
<br />
After 4 episodes of that it devolves into a &#039;food tastes good&#039; anime. I don&#039;t know how many times people need to be reminded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370478">
        that food tastes good, but this anime is here for all of it. Look, I get that Japenese people live lives intentionally devoid of most luxury and taste is one of the only things they allow themselves to become indulgent in, but jesus can we stop this trope already? almost the entire rest of the anime is her cooking food and everyone remarking how good it is. maybe they switch it up AND SOMEBODY ELSE COOKS and then everyone remarks how good it is. Occasionally you will get a &quot;You mean if I go beat monster X, I can eat food X!?!?&quot; type of scenario and it still sucks. the fights are completely lame considering she&#039;s so OP. literally never faces any real danger herself the entire time. She&#039;s also kind of a nitwit and not very efficient with using her powers. The only rule to them is she has to be thinking about bears and she doesn&#039;t even remember to do that most of the time.<br />
<br />
But here is the kicker, at THE LAST HALF OF THE LAST EPISODE(!) it again devolves into a pure yuri anime out of nowhere. It doesn&#039;t make any sense. The show itself ends on a confession that really doesn&#039;t get resolved. Is the bear girl a lesbian with the other little girl now? I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t care. I was honestly wishing they would just go eat some food and talk about how good it tastes again.<br />
<br />
I find it rather confounding this thing isn&#039;t scoring in the 5 range. It&#039;s awful. Are people giving it 10s out of irony? has to be

    After reading the novel, I was excited to see this story getting an adaption, only to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
The book was written as a comedy with some dark overtones to mix it up. (The main character gets nicknamed the bloody bear after beating the crap out of an adventurer using a dull knife). But the show takes all the dark themes away and what is left is... a kids show with only one real character. Not what I expected given all the action the book includes.<br />
<br />
If you haven&#039;t read the book, its infinitely better than the show plus it has real secondary characters. The show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363712">
        mediocre adaption of the summary at best.<br />
<br />
Spoiler:<br />
lol, the show is more like the picture book Yuna creates for the princess than the actual book.

    Cuuuuute~<br />
<br />
Transported into a game: the genre, has just gone nuclear....nuclear cute!!<br />
<br />
The premise alone makes it a hilarious take and the first few episodes really bring home the embarrassment and cuteness that comes with overpowered bear suits. The creativity to continue the bear theme is certainly impressive and the good-naturedness of the show is welcomely wholesome.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as the show continues it suffers from the wash, rinse, repeat of it all with little to do with character. <br />
<br />
The show itself is pretty and chose a unique palette for the art to emphasize the cuteness. It&#039;s a fun watch nonetheless.<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t much substance, and when compared to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369434">
        other shows within this genre it also doesn&#039;t stand up to the mediocre ones as it can easily slip the mind and not be too memorable. <br />
<br />
It&#039;ll be hard for me to recommend this outside of a &quot;good afternoon to recharge yourself.&quot;

     I had my expectations to the ground because I knew that Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear was aimed at an audience of 4 to 13 and I am not surprised that it has a second season because this type of tea is very popular in the Japanese, we know that there are An adult audience that washes and if you see a year that invites you to see this anime even if it is a girl if you do not like it, leave with any excuse because that person is crazy and is selling you stinky skunk smoke because: the story is mediocre, bore 1000

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383419">
        % the protagonist does not have any danger as in the game or in real life, all the characters are not interesting like the world the only thing that could give him a point that pains me a lot is for the animation that is well cared for so much wasted talent and If anyone likes this type of story, what I can recommend is the anime Itai no wa Iya nano by Bougyoryoku and Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu.

    I got a pun, but it is pretty bad. Please, bear with me. This is way more moe than Sword Art Online; the moe is so high with this one that it is unbearable. Like and subscribe for more bear puns every week. Like, now. I am watching you! Yes-yes, you! <br />

Now that I have your attention. Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear revolves around a 15-year-old girl named Yuna. One day, upon returning home, she is hyped for a new update for her favorite world&#039;s first VRMMO, World Fantasy Online. Ever since the game service began one year ago, she quit going to school and just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369375">
        passed time doing absolutely nothing, but playing the game. After the server’s maintenance has been performed and a new update has become online, Yuna meets either a GM, or an NPC, telling her that all the players may receive a loot box and the reward will depend on how long they have been playing the game. <br />
<br />
Yuna receives a kuma costume, which she finds embarrassing at first, but later quickly forgets about that feeling, when she sees the stats of this costume, which are quite high. Having received the costume, she is also asked to take a survey: her attitude towards real life, her opinion on the game, if she believes in God and finally if she finds the kuma costume cute. Finally, she logs in the game and finds out that she wears that detestable kuma costume and receives a mail from some mysterious person. That person welcomes her in the new world, since she finds real life too boring. ‘Enjoy your new life, wearing the costume, you do not like, in a world, in which you are sent by someone, you know nothing about. Muhaahahah.’ Things become complicated, when Yuna finds out that she is now not in a virtual reality, but rather in a real world.<br />
<br />
One thing that anime has taught me is that whenever a mysterious person asks you if you believe in God, you should always say ‘yes.’ Otherwise, you might face the same fate as Tanya von Degurechaff. Wrong anime.  Anyways, it is unclear, who sends Yuna in a parallel world, where you can easily die and will never return home, but one thing is obvious. Whoever sends Yuna in a new world, has either a good sense of humor, or does not appreciate her attitude towards life, because the only thing the girl cares about is games. This is not healthy. She is sent in a parallel world, when she can use her brains for whatever she likes. However, what she does is more of exploring the new world and helping those who are in need, since it is not that much of a problem for her to even heal a person without doing that much. <br />
<br />
Anyways, do not regard this as some serious isekai. This is more of a parody on overpowered isekai protagonists. It is one of these cute girls do cute things without anything serious about it. It is one of these wholesome anime to just relax. Depression, fuck you.

    Kuma Kuma bear was one of the wholesome surprises of the year. <br />
<br />
Cute, cozy and a badass female MC, Kuma Kuma bear provided us with 12 weeks of quality anime. It managed to take a lot of traditional isekai tropes and throw them out the window. If you’ve ever strayed away from isekai because of generic OP MC’s, horrible plot logic or writing, harems, fan-service, etc., you will find something refreshing in Kuma Kuma bear. <br />
<br />
What I really loved the most about this show is how it focused on the real implications of being transported to another world. Yuna has to provide for herself and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369387">
        ends up becoming an entrepreneur of sorts. A lot of isekai tend to skip over these details in favour of showing cool fights or introducing girls into the harem, which I also like, but it’s nice to have a change of pace and focus on things that “matter”.<br />
<br />
I think fans of Bofuri will recognise a lot of similarities between the two series, both in terms of the MC being a young cute girl and the worlds, character interactions, comedy, etc. Bofuri ended up becoming a lot more popular, probably due to it being Silver Link, while Kuma Kuma ended up under the radar. If you liked Bofuri, you will probably enjoy this too.<br />
<br />
Kuma Kuma bear was a sleeper hit of the season and I honestly can’t find anything that I didn’t like or would change about the show, other than it only being 12 episodes. Kuma Kuma bear gets 10 bear suits out of 10.

    (Note: finished watching it, but I couldn&#039;t bother with episode 10 and 11, my god)<br />
<br />
I base all my scores on anime that give me enjoyment, therefore everything I write is subjective and my honest opinion. If you think my opinion is bad, fair enough. With that being said, let me say this. There is no reason to watch this show unless 1) you need to add another show to you anime list 2) you really long for something chill even though it doesn&#039;t make sense and 3) you&#039;re younger than 7 years of age (which would be by today&#039;s standards still an insult to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365750">
        intelligence of modern children with access to the internet.)<br />
<br />
1) The show/MC (Yuna)<br />
This anime is your run of the mill isekai with a very intelligent main protagonist that, of course, trades in stocks and plays VR games and likes to be introverted most of the time. So far, so standard. What&#039;s the issue? Aside from this being just moe-moment-of-the-week type of anime, action scenes are not bad, everything else is kept to a pretty good standard, some corners are cut, like non-animated scenes of the landscape and of the city, animating just the characters we need to be aware of. Yuna is fine and just slightly, relatable, but I will not give out any more than that on her. You make your own judgment on her as a character, that&#039;s why we have our brains, not to be a flock of sheep, but think about everything we see, hear, touch, experience. I have no reason to write reviews except for ego boost and clout chasing.<br />
<br />
2) Characters<br />
They have a very simplistic design, Noir and Misa are forgettable at best, annoying young brats at worst. I like the character of Fina, she feels less forgettable and slightly relatable, unlike the former two. Art is standardized, meaning no matter the scene or place of the show (so far), you will be hard pressed to find anything wrong with their faces or anything of that sort. They&#039;re not doing much, but they always look flawless, so bonus points for &quot;keeping it real&quot;. As for other characters, there&#039;s nothing so far to talk about.<br />
<br />
3) The sound design<br />
Not gonna lie, the fact that animation is good enough to not be a disaster or a masterpiece would make this anime just fine. But the music...as someone with a musical background, I gotta say, the music playing in the background or during action scenes, it all fits perfectly. Most of the music is fitting the general theme of the world, aka fantasy. Use of strings and reverb make some scenes more impactful and I have to stress, if the music is right, you won&#039;t notice it. If the music is good, you will come to appreciate and...yeah, I appreciate it. It&#039;s simple, but it works REALLY well.<br />
¨<br />
As for sound design concerning the action and the impact of...Kuma fists? I&#039;m not an expert in this field, I don&#039;t make sound effects, but I know SFX are made once and reused until they become noticeable and recognizable in many animes. I think around 2018 or 2019, when we started to hear explosions in anime, we started to hear this &quot;tearing, cracking and exploding bubbles of C4&quot; type of explosions. So far, I was not able to detect any similarity with other animes, but I&#039;m sure some of the impact SFX are being used from the soundbank somewhere in Japanese servers of animation studios. <br />
<br />
4) Opening and ED<br />
This opening is the perfect summary of this anime, it&#039;s gamey, it&#039;s lovey-dovey and incredibly unbearable to watch even once. Nothing interesting.<br />
ED sound nice, you can vibe to it, much better than the opening, but unless you&#039;re a girl and like this type of music, as a guy, I can only listen to this once every 3 weeks. I&#039;m not into this type of the song, but it sounds good, take a listen. It&#039;s not industry-changing or appalling, it&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Final conclusion: Don&#039;t watch it, you gain nothing and lose time. <br />
<br />
They try to make this anime a worthwhile endeavour to watch, but their efforts are cut short by the non-existent story and lack of any meaningful direction. Watch Jujutsu Kaisen instead or DanMachi, at least they&#039;re fun to watch.<br />

    An absolute masterpiece of outstanding animation, sound, and character design. Truly one of the only shows on this platform that deserve a score of &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Many people go into this show expecting some sort of deep character development and inner revelation, but that is clearly not what this show is for. If you are looking for some excessive character development, go watch something like re-zero. This show is a wholesome, lovable series about a shy girl in a bear costume that gradually opens up to the people around her. <br />
<br />
The story is exactly what it needs to be. Nothing more and nothing less. Although many

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377384">
        people complain about the simplicity of the plot, I believe that the simple plot is what makes this show so amazing. It&#039;s less about bracing yourself for unexpected plot twists and feeling your pounding heart as something goes horribly wrong, and instead feels like a peaceful cruise through the happiest place in existence. Watching these characters walk through their simple conflicts and resolutions is a hidden joy that can only be found in a select few anime. This show is undoubtedly the happiest I&#039;ve ever been watching an isekai anime, and maybe even any anime ever. Many shows that have a complex story tend to leave either leave behind their theme, or tunnel vision onto the theme. Kuma kuma kuma bear&#039;s theme is so naturally incorporated into the show that you don&#039;t even realize how soothing it is until you really think about it later on. <br />
<br />
The opening and ending as well as the soundtrack within also perfectly resonate with the mood and story of this show. Once again, I know I am beginning to sound repetitive, but I cannot stress enough how fantastic of a job the producers did of this show. The soft art style also majorly contributes to this theme that the show does an immaculate job at the building. Animation and art are just so well done in this show that I can&#039;t even begin to write down how I feel about them. The style and sound combine together to create the most surreal experience. The experience of watching this show is like a large, fluffy bear giving your heart a hug and just warming you up from the inside. Nothing is better than thoroughly enjoying a show you are watching, and that goes double for this. <br />
<br />
After reading the manga, I could hardly contain my excitement when I saw the anime adaptation was already airing. Once the all the episodes were out, I immediately and swiftly binged the entire show in a day, and if you couldn&#039;t tell from this review, it did not disappoint. This adaptation is undoubtedly the definitive best I have ever seen, and it goes far beyond the original source. Is this show perfect? Obviously, no. all shows will have their flaws here and there, but this show is about as close to perfect as I will ever be willing to admit. While most shows imperfections tend to stand out and nag at the mind, in kuma kuma kuma bear, the flaws just seem irrelevant and pointless to point out because of how much happiness and just pure awe the show gives me. The few minor things this show does just don&#039;t seem to even enter my mind while watching, and are so minuscule that it wouldn&#039;t be a stretch to call this show perfect. To sum up this lengthy review: Do I recommend this show? As long as you&#039;re not looking for something this show can obviously not provide, a hundred times YES.

    I found this anime a few months ago while looking at upcoming anime and saw this as a cute isekai that I would probably enjoy and not think too much about, but this was better than that. At first glance, it&#039;s your standard fantasy isekai that doesn&#039;t stand out much from the others, but if you give this anime a chance, you will find it is really wholesome. Every episode left me with a smile as I watched these characters develop and the main character help more and more people. 10 out of 10 would recommend. I can&#039;t wait for season 2, and will probably

    Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is a weird blend of Isekai and Iyashikei genres.<br />
<br />
The main protagonist, Yuna, is transported to another game-like world, where she is given an overpowered bear suit, which basically makes her a god of that new world. Due to this overpowerednes, parts that follow the Isekai route are a bit boring, although still quite enjoyable. There is some plot, and world-building but nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Yuna&#039;s bear suit and her lovely &quot;pets&quot; are a magnet for little kids who absolutely adore her, and she loves them even more. This part that follows their everyday peaceful life is pure enjoyment. Yuna&#039;s interactions

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369682">
        with her army of cute friends are a joy to watch. The kids are all super nice and cute. Watching them having fun and eating many delicious dishes, really does have a healing factor. <br />
<br />
Yuna as a character is really relatable. She is not a fan of society and dislikes people in general, one exception being little kids, as they are still pure and uncorrupted. Thanks to her relationship with them, she finds out that fortunately for her, there are some decent grown-ups in the world.<br />
<br />
A score of 8 is maybe a bit harsh, as I am sure that I&#039;d enjoy it more if I watched this after it aired and not week by week.<br />
<br />
Two similar anime come to mind: Amaama to Inazuma(Sweetness &amp; Lightning), and If It&#039;s for My Daughter, I&#039;d Even Defeat a Demon Lord.

Honestly this show the previous 11 weeks used to be mindless fun, something to relax every wednesday morning, a charming protagonist helping people and learning how to interact with people, that was her only hurdle most of the season because in terms of power she started so strong in the alternate world that she didn&#039;t face anything on her level until her very last battle.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#039;t episode 12, episode 12 was completely different but also used the same elements it established since the first episode to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369513">
        deliver something beautiful.<br />
<br />
Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Yuna started as a loner that enjoyed being alone since episode 1, that was fine but it never looked like the show was gonna do anything with it, and I was okay with that, a chill show in which you just enjoy the slice of life with the occasional battles that never even have any sakuga because why would they? They aren&#039;t the focus, it was a simple show free of any serious issues, everything the protagonist faced wasn&#039;t taken seriously.<br />
<br />
So I couldn&#039;t see what the show was building up since the start.<br />
<br />
I noticed in one of the latest episodes our protagonist Yuna realized in a scene how nice it is to get along with people, it didn&#039;t last long but I thought that was a nice reminder of how much she has changed from what she used to be. It would end like that and move onto the next arc.<br />
<br />
Oh how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Enter Fina, the first meeting she had with Yuna was considerably different to the meetings Yuna has with the rest of girls in the show, a bit hard to notice because Fina was before everyone else but now looking back in retrospective, it was kinda obvious they were setting up something back then.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s the thing, in retrospective.<br />
<br />
The show did a perfect job to mask what it was setting up for 11 episodes, using adventures and battles and silly slice of life interactions with snarky remarks and good timed comedy. But everything was building up in the background.<br />
<br />
Fina&#039;s feelings were building up.<br />
<br />
Fina got a whole nice segment around the middle of the show about her and Yuna going out together the 2 of them and no one else. When the episode 12 preview showed its title I thought the last episode would be a repeat of that but on a much larger scale because it&#039;s the finale.<br />
<br />
Oh, how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Turns out everything Yuna did until this point had consequences, namely neglecting Fina because she had to take care of all the people she knew. This wouldn&#039;t work if the whole show didn&#039;t play out as it did, we see Yuna do the things she usually does every week but this time from Fina&#039;s perspective, we see what she feels and what she thinks and at this point she had enough, she decides to distance herself so she can be as worthy of her presence to Yuna as all the other &quot;useful&quot; citizens are to the bear.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s not what she wanted, that&#039;s not what Yuna wanted either.<br />
<br />
Enter Noa, all the previous bonds Yuna made through the show will always be important even if they aren&#039;t as important as Fina&#039;s, and now that the 2 main girls are distancing themselves those bonds have to help our protagonists. Noa is a delight of a character and she shines the most here, as much as she loves the bear she has to help these 2 useless lovebirds to realize what they are doing wrong.<br />
<br />
And help she does.<br />
<br />
Yuna doesn&#039;t understand it but she knows Fina is the only one that fills the emptiness in her heart, meanwhile Fina always knew but because she lacked courage she couldn&#039;t say it. When it finally happens and both let everything out and tell each other how much they want to be together, it&#039;s the most cathartic moment ever not only because of how the episode built up to it but also because everything that was presented since the very beginning. This wouldn&#039;t work if we hadn&#039;t seen a lonely Yuna in the first episode and how their meeting played out in 2, things that were seemingly meaningless had the strongest meanings all along.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s beautiful.<br />
<br />
10/10, this show should be a guide to everyone about how to write a proper romance.

Every season, there are anime with all girls like this anime, but it&#039;s all girls and anime reminds me of an anime like this, Bofuri, the anime is almost the same as the fantasy world where there are overpowered girls. This anime is good enough for you to fill in the time and also this anime is also good for family watching or you to watch with small children, because anime is family-friendly and doesn&#039;t have much action either, in my opinion, this anime is almost all about food.<br />
<br />
Visuals and anime graphics are really good, I like the art and I really like the colorful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369491">
        ones, how about it, the sound is normal and for the characters, I think everything is almost the same like they all like bears and I really enjoy anime.<br />
<br />
I still hope there will be more action and adventure. I don&#039;t know you guys. But I really like the ending with &quot;Will Kuma-san eat me?&quot; and please, isekai lovers, watch this anime.<br />
<br />
Indonesia:<br />
<br />
Setiap musim pasti ada aja anime yang isinya cewek semua kayak anime ini nih isekai sih tapi isinya cewek semua dan anime ngingetin gua sama anime yang kayak gini yaitu Bofuri, anime nya hampir sama kayak gini dunia fantasi yang ada cewek overpower. Anime ini sih lumayan buat kalian ngisi waktu dan juga anime ini juga bagus buat ditonton keluarga atau kalian nonton ama anak kecil, karena ini anime family friendly dan gak banyak action juga sih malahan menurut gua anime ini tuh hampir isinya tentang makanan.<br />
<br />
Visual dan grafis anime bagus banget gua suka sama artnya juga gua suka banget yang gini colorfull gimana gitu, buat soundnya tuh biasa aja dan untuk karakternya menurut gua semuanya hampir sama gitu kayak mereka semua suka beruangnya dan gua sih lumayan nikmatin nih anime sih.<br />
<br />
Gua sih berharap yang lebih ada action dan adventure nya gitu. Gua gak tau kalo kalian. Tapi gua suka banget endingnya yang adengan &quot;Apa Kuma-san akan memakanku?&quot; dan silakan para pecinta isekai tonton anime ini.
