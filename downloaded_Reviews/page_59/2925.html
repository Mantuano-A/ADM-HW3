    The ever expansive Index franchise has led to numerous adaptations in the form of full seasons, spinoffs, OVAs, and even movies. Accelerator, the strongest level 5 Esper in Academy City, should be no stranger to anyone who is familiar with the franchise. Yet, spinoffs can be risky to pull off. Considering a character like Accelerator, that really is no understatement.<br />
<br />
Written by the brainchild of the Index franchise, Kazuma Kamachi made this piece of work as an original spinoff. Its emphasis revolves around the dark side of Academy City. Unlike Railgun, the show takes on a darker storytelling route although the overall style will feel familiar.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318409">
        Be aware that if you plan to watch this, it is recommended to at watch Index season 1 or at least the episodes dealing with Accelerator’s role and his encounter with Last Order. Otherwise, the experience of watching this spinoff can be less exhilarating.<br />
<br />
If I said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times. A Certain Scientific Accelerator deals with the science side and the darker elements of the Index franchise. You should certainly expect the main story to chronicle Accelerator’s role as a protagonist despite his character being more of anti-hero. And that’s something to keep a tabs on. Accelerator is somewhat of a niche character, meaning that it has a target audience. He’s always had this ‘bad boy’ image painted over him and his actions speaks louder than words. In fact, some episodes from this spinoff gave me flashbacks from the original seasons. In particular, his fights reminds me of the encounters with Hound Dog feels similar to Index Season II. With his ever sadistic personality, Accelerator is by no means a noble protagonist. The only soft side he shows towards is Last Order, a young girl he devotes to protect from researchers and assassins. In contrast to Touma, Accelerator often resorts to violence to solve problems rather than words. By the time this show ends, you’re going to lose count the number of bodies dropping on the floor.<br />
<br />
Storytelling wise, the spinoff itself surprisingly doesn’t contain much background plot about Accelerator himself. The original series revealed more of his past so like I mentioned before, watch the previous seasons to understand his character. On the other hand, this spinoff does reveal more background about the DA (Disciplinary Action), a controversial group of Anti-Skill with their own mission to deliver justice in Academy City. Another new character named Esther also gets her own background storytelling. She was originally part of DA but defects after encountering Accelerator and Last Order. With a friendlier personality and value in human life, Esther is sort of the anti-Accelerator. Unfortunately, the darker side of Academy City isn’t going to be a place of salvation for her or anyone else. Throughout the show, the plot is somewhat loose but always carry a sense of darkness. This is extended to organizations such as Scavenger, a mercenary group who shows no value of human life. If you don’t believe me, watch as how they dispose of those who gets in their way, even including their own allies. <br />
<br />
Like most people, you probably decided to watch the spinoff because you’re curious to see how this anime stands out on its own. Whether you find Accelerator likeable or not is a different story. Considering the original main characters (Touma, Misaka, Hamazura) are absent, there’s a lot of emphasis put on Accelerator to carry this show. Unfortunately, he doesn’t. Well, he doesn’t really carry this anime with his over the top antics or personality. To be honest, Accelerator serves better as an anti-hero than a heroic protagonist. While his actions aren’t always noble, the anime wants to make him look like a hero at times. This is mostly shown with his ways of protecting Last Order. However, there’s not much character development for either character. Their relationship remains relatively the same and it mostly chronicles their daily life together. Whether it’s going out for simple meals or having small talks, it’s pretty much as straightforward as it can be. With the addition of Esther, it adds small rooms for character dynamics between the trio but not much to praise about. In other words, do not expect your mind to be blown this season with masterful character study. It’s more of average characterization dedicated to the Index franchise to bring more content for its fan base.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the voice of Accelerator, he returns to bring the character we all remember. Being that way, this spinoff doesn’t truly commit on changing anything different about him. The Index franchise itself has been an expansive universe and this is just one part, the darker side of Academy City. In essence, this spinoff is just average being that it represents what it is but you’re not going to come out of this show being mesmerized.

    &lt;LA hears Nobuhiko Okamoto&#039;s cackling Accelerator sound&gt;...TIME FOR THE ANTI-HERO&#039;s main story!<br />
<br />
Accelerator getting his own story set before Index III?..Sign LA up! and guess what it&#039;s GREAT...seriously why does To aru spinoffs seems much better than the main line Index anime series?<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s the plot to To aru Kagaku Accelerator?...well Accelerator become embroiled in a conspiracy with the Antiskill renegades with the DA who have connections to the higher ups of Academy City, where one of the higher ups being a researcher finding his own way of making Level 6 Espers using robots and the dead, it&#039;s not until Esther Rosenthal voiced by Yurika Kubo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318435">
        wants Accelerator&#039;s help in stopping this where he comes in...and we see a harem forming because of course.<br />
<br />
For what&#039;s it&#039;s worth it feels like what the main villain is wanting to achieve is what Accelerator&#039;s past goal of becoming Level 6 is in which Accelerator is now wanting to stop, as the main villain using necromancy to &quot;make&quot; a level 6 which compares to Accelerator killing the 20,000 Level 4 Misaka clones in order to achieve the same thing, but for an artificial Level 6 doesn&#039;t compare to a original Number 1 Level 5 Esper. LA actually really likes this and makes like Accelerator once again righting wrongs by stopping someone else from doing what he wanted to become.<br />
<br />
Heck the new character Esther is interesting as her own backstory to the entire ordeal with the artificial level 6 necromancy has thematic links to Accelerator&#039;s dark past and her ALSO wanting to right wrongs caused by her power. Esther being the deuteragonist also gets major development as to how she was swept up into the Level 6 Shift project and lured in with friendship, also Esther&#039;s beliefs on being a necromancer is tested as Esther believes that being a necromancer can be used for good, something that Accelerator is learning from both in the plot and thematically as well and because of this Esther was a brilliant new addition to the anime and the To aru universe.<br />
<br />
To this end, if Railgun showed the slice of life and slightly dark sides to the scientific side of Academy City...then Accelerator shows the utter dark side of Academy City scientific side and they go into the deep end, you know what with the Antiskill&#039;s dark secret with the DA, an experiment finding low leveled espers at the end of their ropes and KILLING them and using their power for the level 6 experiments can be some...blatant examples and considering the narrative focus IS on Accelerator...makes sense makes sense and with all that it allows more world bulding to Academy City in terms of the science&#039;s deranged dark side.<br />
  <br />
The animation done by JC Staff and A.C.G.T was actually pretty great, from the derpy and rather lacking animation from Index III, Accelerator takes the character designs to give itself a much more crisper, sharper and updated look to them and it&#039;s easy to see the updated animation. The battles were great as well to show off Accelerator&#039;s destructive capabilities and even the backgrounding helped show Accelerator or certain characters moods and feelings even in the bustling Academy City and even the gorey elements has been heighten due it being Accelerator and all. Nonetheless great job JC Staff and A.C.G.T<br />
<br />
The voice cast was awesome and like LA aforementioned at the start of there view, Nobuhiko Okamoto brings in Accelerator crazed cacklings even more into Accelerator&#039;s own main story and it&#039;s glorious, the returning cast are great to from Rina Hidaka as Last Order, Nozomi Sasaki as he Misaka clones and Yuuko Kaida as Aio Yomikawa. Due to some new characters to the heaping pile from the To aru universe, come sin Yurika Kubo as Esther Rosenthal, Aoi Koga voiced by Naru who is playing against the type from her previous role of Kaguya Shinomiya from Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen to  the same with Akane Fujita as Leader. Really the entire voice cast be it new or old are great and it&#039;s to be expected the voice cast was gonna be great either way.<br />
<br />
By the final episodes, Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator goes full out crazy with it&#039;s premise but epic in some ways, something Index III tried to do but failed and yet Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator did it in fewer episodes...huh. Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator got awesome by the end as the scaling and build up of the major villain and plot twists took a turn for the better and again with the thematic developments of Esther and Accelerator leading up to the major villain in all this just made this finale worth it. <br />
<br />
Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator is just another great installment of the To aru universe and cleanses LA&#039;s palette on the rushed and almost confusingly derpy Index III, here&#039;s hoping To aru Kagaku no Railgun III will have the same treatment as Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator...

    Preface: The adaption of the Accelerator anime is a great improvement over the adaption of the Index 3 material, whether it was through improved scheduling or having a manga to base the artwork on, JC Staff has made a notable improvement in its adaption. None the less this adapt suffers from different issues, despite being a good adapt of the source material the series itself cannot be good if the source material itself is weak. This review will expand on why the anime was fairly average, and what fans of the Toaru series can expect from it.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
<br />
The story for Toaru Kagaku

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318408">
        No Accelerator is largely a page by page faithful adapt of the source material with some extra flash backs, an anime only first episode, and skipping a few redundant scenes. This story takes place right after the head shot Accelerator experiences when trying to save Last Order in the original Index anime, in short it takes place fairly early in the timeline of the series during season 1 of index, and slightly after the events of the Sister’s Noise project in Railgun S. Accelerator is in the hospital still recovering and his head wound still bleeds if he moves around to quick, Last Order is taking care of him and he’s still his old edgy self. It is made clear in the first anime original episode that Accelerator is not at full capacity and is still prone to side effects of his headshot which will later on in the story explain why he keeps letting opponents get away or how he manages to get injured despite his ability. The story after the anime original episode is largely focused on several factions getting in Accelerators hair after he rescues a necromancer, Estelle, from pursuers because she may have a link to Last Order. The factions include one delusional siscon scientist and his imouto, a bunch of self-righteous comically stupid anti skill members who joined a cult, and some edgy teen girls who run an assassination squad. Most of the story is focused on him fighting these groups and making fun of them as he crushes them with relative ease.<br />
<br />
Some issues are present in the story that make it worse and less enjoyable, the first reason is because Accelerator is far too overpowered for the actual story, he never has a challenge and sort of just pisses on every opponent he comes across in a very edgy way taunting them for how weak they comparatively are and then fucking with them for amusement. There are some stakes and serious moments, but they always involve side characters and the audience knows nothing bad will happen because Accelerator will protect Last Order for sure and that the fact that Index season 2 exists proves nothing bad will happen ahead of time. Now normally this could be done in a way that has entertainment value for example turning it into a comedic show where Accelerator is largely not caring about anything going on and turning the show into slice of life. However, sadly this is not possible because the show takes itself way to seriously despite the fact that the existence of the rest of Toaru in the continuity guarantees that no threat Accelerator faces in this spin off will ever harm him or his favorite loli.<br />
<br />
Due to this the story is simply edgy, boring at times, has no real sense of tension for someone who actually follows the Toaru series, and is needlessly convoluted in explaining the final villain’s powers to somebody who has not seen the Toaru series. It is weak in exposition and as a thriller to both index fans and people new to the series alike so overall it cannot be said that this spin off has a good story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
<br />
Well the art isn’t bad at all and is significantly better than season 3 of Index in comparison, clearly JC staff actually scheduled things properly this time. The new character designs are amazing, last order and the Misaka clones look so rubbery and shiny and it is absurdly cute. The animation itself is a bit choppy and slow but that’s expected so it did not hurt the show to much as the backgrounds and character design made up for it.<br />
<br />
However, there were 2 things that heavily lowered my score for the art this season, the first is fight choreography. This entire show was largely focused on action, so having low quality fights was a huge disappointment. The vast majority of the fights simply had Accelerator tank some attacks to show off and then 1 shot his opponents without any serious effort. The only fights where he had to expend some effort were full of bad, jarring and immersion breaking CGI that kept the viewer from actually focusing on the fight and instead looking in awe at how bad the special effects were. The second thing that hurt the art rating is the fact there were so many absurdly well animated shows this season, after seeing shows like Demon Slayer I cannot possibly even give the art score of Accelerator a 7, the standards for the industry have gone up and meanwhile JC staff is animating the Accelerator anime like its 2009.<br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
The opening was a hit and is something I will constantly replay as it is in a playlist of openings that are worth listening to, and the soundtrack is pretty intense and even compensated for the awful fight choreography and lack of tension at times. The index series has never had a bad soundtrack or opening, that is one thing that has never let me down.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
Accelerator is Accelerator and if you enjoy watching Accelerator you will enjoy the characters in this show as the show is largely focused on Accelerator. Outside of that, Last Order is as cute as ever, the Academy City students got some screen time with Uiharu and Saten, the side characters like Estelle and her corpse doll were fun to watch and misaka clones are always hilarious.<br />
<br />
Some weaknesses however were the villains, all of them were idiots and quite cringey to watch, cant even blame JC Staff on the characterization here, the antagonists were also delusional idiots in the manga as well. Some cops with a completely detached from reality view on justice which was bordering on religious fanaticism, some edgy girls who really hated teachers, and a delusional siscon scientist made up the antagonists. It is clear that the author meant for them to be either throwaway characters or fodder for level 5 espers like the teenage girl assassination squad.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
<br />
I actually did enjoy this spin off, and if you enjoy anything Toaru I think you won’t hate it either. There is much to be desired, that this anime lacks, but the additions to the world building and power systems of Toaru in the final 2 episodes, create more than enough reason to watch the anime for any fan of the series. I would not recommend watching this anime stand alone but with context from either the novels or the index anime. Overall I did have fun watching this anime and its worth checking out.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
I give this show a 7, it was fairly average and most of my list consists of 7 ratings as unless something is really bad I will not rate anime lower than this. It is worth a watch if you are a Toaru fan, and if you can overlook the flaws in the show. Despite all the flaws that were pointed out in this review, the show itself is enjoyable and a decent spin off for the Toaru series as a whole.

    A Certain Scientific Accelerator (Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator) is a Japanese manga series, which was written by Kazuma Kamachi (Heavy Object) and illustrated by Arata Yamaji. An anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff and A.C.G.T aired on July 12, 2019. The final episode aired on September 27, 2019.<br />
<br />
Accelerator is considered the most powerful psychic in Academy City and one of a few able to shift to the level 6. He, however, now lives a peaceful life and tries to recover from the past injuries. His rest is interrupted, when a rogue group within Anti-Skill called DA that is obsessed with bringing justice to Academy City

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318428">
        so much that it would even opt for kidnapping and experiments on humans, causes pure havoc in the city. While Accelerator does not like to be bothered and hates problems, Disciplinary Action, or DA is enough of a threat for Accelerator to take actions, mainly because of the fact that the rogue group, for some unknown reason, is trying to kidnap The Last Order. Now only Accelerator can save the Academy City and The Last Order from the zealous fanatics, working in DA. <br />
<br />
While A Certain Scientific Accelerator is not a direct continuation, or prequel to any of the series, you will need to watch A Certain Scientific Railgun to understand what is going on in the series, otherwise it will be somewhat difficult to interpret the story-line. You might also watch Toaru Majutsu no Index to get a full understanding. With that being said, the main villain of A Certain Magical Index franchise finally gets his own TV series. While many might hate him for the person he is, attentive viewers and readers will understand his motives. It was nice for him to get a personal TV series that will show the viewer more about Accelerator. In addition to this, just like in Toaru Majutsu no Index, Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator unites magic and science and the end result of this is quite of a mystery that is not only breathtaking, but also disturbing sometimes. And when it becomes disturbing, it will make you feel hella uncomfortable. No spoilers, though. <br />
<br />
Animation wise, it is, without a doubt, an absolute masterpiece: characters design, backgrounds, action scenes, facial expressions; absolutely beautiful. Sound wise, if there is an English dub one day, I would still highly recommend you to watch it subbed; there is only one Accelerator and it is Okamoto Nobuhiko. <br />
<br />
As for the characters, there is only one new protagonist that is worth mentioning, Rosenthal Esther. Let us omit the type of magic she practices and just say that she is a magician that wants to meet Accelerator to inform him about the upcoming events. She is a very easy-going individual, who, in reality, possesses a terrifying power. Anyways, A Certain Scientific Accelerator has a pretty nice character cast, including supporting character, as well as villains. <br />
<br />
All in all, A Certain Scientific Accelerator is a great addition to the franchise. As mentioned before, it might be difficult for you to understand the plot of A Certain Scientific Accelerator without watching other TV series, but it will still be enjoyable, so it is up to you to decide. <br />
<br />
9 Misakas/10, says Misaka Misaka trying to hide the fact that the whole review is nothing but fangirlism, but actually giving it 9 Misakas, instead of 10, hiding her attitude towards the said series.

    Reaaally great Spin-Off<br />
After Index III was o so disappointing this really hits the spot<br />
<br />
The story was pretty exceptional as expected for a Toaru series. And of course if we&#039;re talking about accelerator, the characters- no, the villains need to be completely crazy and insane. Such twisted mind sh** and sorta psychological drama is just what I expected from this.<br />
<br />
It focused pretty much on fights tho as there was some fight alnost every episode and some even taking a whole episode. Basically just showcasing how OP Accelerator is, except for the final fight, in which he rather played the role of an OP sidekick<br />
<br />
Music was outstanding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318490">
        ofc and animations were pretty sick too. Esther was a pretty nice addition too for this, the whole story resolved around her after all. <br />
And it had pretty much an open end so there&#039;s more to come. We now have Imagine Breaker&#039;s, Railgun&#039;s and Accelerator&#039;s story in the Toaru series. Makes me wonder how the novel is written. <br />
Overall a great Spin-Off. 8/10

    Let&#039;s be real, not a lot of people have a lot of expectation going into this anime. We were just done with the massive trainwreck that is Index 3 (and this is after 8 years, people. 8 years for this to come out); the manga is not well-like among the community (despite that 7.8 score on MAL), and, you know, it is J.C.<br />
<br />
Remember OPM2? Remember (again) Index 3?<br />
So, how did they do with this?<br />
<br />
You know, I never really understood Index as a franchise. The side stories are done much more spectacularly than the main story; crisper animation, clearer story-telling (though that may just be because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314678">
        of Index&#039;s fundamentally difficult-to-grasp storytelling involving a lot of religions). This is one of those cases.<br />
<br />
Without getting in too much of spoiler territory, A Certain Scientific Accelerator is chronologically after Accelerator&#039;s surgery from Heaven Canceller (back when he was shot in the head by Amai Ou (I think that&#039;s the name?) back in Index 1), so pretty far back in the story. It features his first event back into the dark side of Academy City, and features one of his first real interaction with magic (specifically necromancy).<br />
<br />
Episode 1, however, is a completely anime-original episode. It does not ring a good bell, does it?<br />
Absolutely genius is what I can only say.<br />
Viewers are already saturated with his figure wearing a cold jacket on a train in Russia, and the event features his head being shot was 9 years ago. Having something to remind the viewers of what happened (especially 10 years ago) is absolutely encouraged. This episode itself is really well-done, remind us that there are people out for Accelerator&#039;s head after the defeat at the L0&#039;s hand, while showing that there definitely exists batshit insane people out there in the City.<br />
<br />
Accelerator&#039;s anime is built upon his relationship with Last Order (or MISAKA 20001), his growth in the relationship with her, as well as his struggle to find the aim of himself. Villain? Hero? Protector? Who knows?<br />
<br />
Story: 9. Much better than the manga, necessary additional and omission of details really help with understanding everything going on, though there are definitely misses, especially those that involved robots.<br />
<br />
Art: 6. What were you expecting?<br />
<br />
Sound: 9. Good OST, typical Index stuff.<br />
<br />
Character: 8. I never really like Estelle as a character, so that dampens the score down.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10. Honestly, for all the shits I have been giving Index 3 and almost Accelerator, it is still 8 years, man. Let this boy enjoy his stuff.

    Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator, the next chapter in the Toaru world/series, was a spin off, or side story, focusing on Accelerator. As someone who&#039;s seen all of Index, and Railgun, I can say, I don&#039;t entirely know where this falls into the overall story line of the universe. It&#039;s obvious that it comes after he receives his gunshot wound, by the flashbacks, the walking cane, and battery powered power regulator. But, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any clear sign as to where exactly this fits in. Considering the scale of the incident, you&#039;d have to think it would have been prevalent in Index in some way

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318481">
        shape or form, if it happened during the 2nd or 3rd season of Index. <br />
<br />
At the same time (slight spoilers ahead, if you plan to watch Index and haven&#039;t yet, maybe stop reading here.)<br />
<br />
He still has his villain complex in this anime, which, thanks to a stern talking to from Touma, he loses that at the end of the third season of index. Regardless, this side story was fun to watch, as is anything involving Accelerator.<br />
<br />
Story: As I talked about in opening, I&#039;m not too sure where this story fits into the overall universe. I have to assume it happened during one of the dead times between the seasons of index, or between a stretch of episodes perhaps. Regardless, this spin off story was super enjoyable, I loved all the references to the things that happened to Accelerator in the Index series, and I think it was incredibly well done, to be able to give his story, and background, without requiring too much knowledge of what happened in Index.<br />
<br />
Art: This wowed me. The art was fantastic in this, as was the animation for the most part. I knew it was good from the start, but, when I really focused on it during the last couple episodes, it stood out to me in an abundance of ways. I feel like the last few episodes, where the color had been drained away from the world, required some impressive work, and I found the aesthetics of those scenes with the gray-scale-esqu appearance to be awesome, and it helped set the tone of the situation they found themselves in.<br />
<br />
Sound: The voice acting was great too. I&#039;ve always loved the voice work done for Accelerator, which helps portray him, as a slightly unstable anti-hero, with a touch of good heart on the side. I think the music was spot on, and the opening fit the anime perfectly.<br />
<br />
Characters: Again, this was impressive. I expected there to be a lot of cameos from Index or Rail Gun, but, they managed to put together a cohesive and interesting story, with very minimal cameos. You of course have Accelerator, and Last order, along with some key members of Antiskill and one of the Misaka clones, but outside of that, it was tame. Never saw Touma, Index, or OG Misaka/her sister/or their friends.<br />
<br />
Instead, they managed to put together a loveable cast of characters, including Esther, who I hope we get to see some of eventually in Index, whenever they get another season of that going. They did a fantastic job with their villains too. You had a sense of hate at times, but, at the same time, could find pity on them too, as they realized what they had become, and what they had done.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: What&#039;s not to enjoy? Accelerator is one of my favorite characters in the Toaru universe, so a show focused on him, was quickly something I was interested in. I loved the fights, and the banter between Accelerator and his group. The story was interesting, and I felt did a good job of becoming more interesting as the anime went on. Not to mention, they left us with something to build off of, whether the scene at the end was indicative of something that might happen in a sequel Accelerator anime, or in Index, I&#039;ll be excitedly awaiting it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10. For me, it&#039;s one of the stronger introductions to the Toaru series, and I hope they keep this production value up for S3 of Railgun in the winter!

    The premise of a darker and more shady story with so much death in it in the same universe as a usually pretty light series in the main story of index was a great concept. I loved the art style change at the end there to put emphasis on how brutal what was going on actually was. They kept Accelerators personality dedicated to the way he was. The ost was great. The only gripe I would have with it would be the lack of character development in the title character. But I guess the development of Ester was done well too.

    A certain Scientific Accelerator finally gave us fans exactly what we wanted. An anime featuring best boy accelerator as the MC.<br />
<br />
UNFORTUNATELY due to there being very little source material from the accelerator manga, and that same material is pretty bad, the story takes a HUGE hit.<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
focus&#039;s around the Necormancer Arc. It&#039;s got a decent premise with extremely flawed execution. It starts from accelerators point of view after the sisters arc. There were things I personally was hoping to see that we only get tiny glimpses of, and things I just wish I hadn&#039;t scene (the ending).<br />
<br />
If the necromancer arc had been given 3-5 episodes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320678">
        I would have been much happier. Instead, with 11 of the 12 episodes being dedicated to it, it ends up feeling drawn out way too long, and with a very dissapointing resolution to boot.<br />
<br />
The art:<br />
Is great, probably some of the best visuals we&#039;ve been given in any ToAru series so far. It is very different visually and directionally from any other of the Index or Railgun seasons, but its a fresh welcome, if a bit confusing as it seems like Railgun T is going back to the old style (heres hoping its not as bad as Index III though)<br />
<br />
The ART:<br />
 is very good, however the use of CG isn&#039;t. Many of the robot&#039;s you see accelerator face are heavy CG, and overall you dont get a good sense of the damage being caused by battles, even in the ending. Something both Index and Railgun did well was show off just how crazy powerful accelerator was by giving us viewpoints from angles of other characters (wide shows, shots from curbsides ect) , which was a great was to show us exactly how unnaturally powerful accelrator is. (think dropping a train scene, not only do we get a shot from above where misaka is on the bridge, but we also get epic wide angle shots that show us the full picture and just how devestatingly powerful the dude is)<br />
<br />
I know that was a bit of a ramble, but I just never really feel the impact that accelerator normally leaves from this season when it comes to him using his abilities. I don&#039;t chalk it up to art as much as I do to just bad fight coreography. (I deff butchered that spelling)<br />
<br />
The sound:<br />
Not much to say, sound effects are dope as allways from a ToAru season, the score is incredible. Shadow is the Lie and Parole are both great OP and ED&#039;s.<br />
<br />
The Characters:<br />
A couple things to be said.<br />
The Antagonist of this season sucks major ass. Boring. Generic. Incredibly stupid for a &quot;genius&quot;. And just plain not fun to see on screen because you just dont feel threatened by him (or her) at all. Their goal doesn&#039;t even seem to be great from a shere story perspective either as it is the exact same goal as accelerators was in the (chronologically) previous arc, which adds to the genericness.<br />
<br />
Accelerator stays cool and dope, even if he talks a little too much like a good guy near the end. While I love his hero/villain complex, I do with he internalized it more because I still can&#039;t find it believable that someone who thinks they are a master villain would actually use the term villain out loud.<br />
<br />
Last Order is cute :)<br />
<br />
The sisters hilarous<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I enjoyed &#039;A Certain Scientific Accelerator&#039; for the first half of the season. It was fresh, I was seeing my favorite character in action again, and I thought I was going to get a more in depth and serious look at Accelerators internal struggle and torment from the Level 6 shift project. Instead I got a bland boring villain, and at most tiny flashes of what could be considered growth, but honestly were nothing more than the growth I&#039;ve scene in previous seasons.<br />
<br />
I still loved the season, just because they finally made it, but I now fuly understand why the manga readers say it was such a terrible arc.<br />
<br />
Spoiler warning:<br />
---------------------------------<br />
I know japan is japan, but I honestly hate anything that ends with &quot;giant organic human based moster absorbing people&quot;. It&#039;s honestly gross and getting &#039;belle-delphine but mutated and ugly&#039; as the final boss makes me want to knock the story score even lower. Esther was cool but continued to just be another example of how most mages in the toaru series are almost useless even compared to level 3 espers. Hopefully we get to see some more powerful magicians (or magic gods) in the potential next season of index.<br />

    I don&#039;t know if it’s just me but this feels so much more watchable then Toaru Majutsu no Index III so good job getting your stuff together J.C staff and A.C.G.T who by the way both don&#039;t have great track records.<br />
Story: 8 Its taken straight from source material and so far has been adapted faithfully with J.C staff not pushing any filler content into the show, Accelerator still is the fantastic edge lord that he is (now with loli) and is just a joy to watch as he gets pushed into the random situations that occur in Academy City. Also for those who have never

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314358">
        seen this series before I would recommend watching Toaru Majutsu no Index I 1st just to get a good idea of our main characters back story.<br />
Art: 8 As stated before, it seems a lot better than Index III. Accelerator&#039;s facial expressions though subdue are on point and I like all the lighting in the scenes so far. Also the powers don&#039;t look absurdly awful which makes the action much more enjoyable.<br />
Sound: 9 Only thing that was on point in Index III and it’s still on point here. The sound effect of Accelerator&#039;s powers is a pleasure to hear. All the other character&#039;s voices are what you expect them to be, and nobody seems out of place. Also don&#039;t worry too much about our main&#039;s loli&#039;s voice, if it annoys you know (at least from my memory) she isn&#039;t too involved in the story.<br />
Character: 7 I still love the edgy, maniac of a character that is Accelerator and his voice actor makes sure to keep this image quite well, the laugh and all. Other than that, the side characters are a bit bland, but they really aren&#039;t the main focus of the series, (This whole series came out because fans just wanted to see more Accelerator content from the author).<br />
Enjoyment: 8 If you hated Index III then let me give you a litter more hope in that this adaptation doesn&#039;t seem like absolute garbage, hopefully the story won&#039;t get rushed, as there really isn&#039;t that much to cover so J.C can take it steady.<br />
Overall: 8 I liked the manga and the adaptation for now doesn&#039;t disappoint, if you wanna see more Accelerator in motion then this is your anime. For those who haven&#039;t seen this character before you that you probably won&#039;t enjoy this as much as Accelerator is a bit of an outdated but still fun to watch character. If I had to describe him it would be a teen Alucard.<br />

    Accelerator is a good dad. Judging by this line &quot;If nothing else...if there&#039;s a chance that it might reach her...I&#039;ll have to do this as ugly as it takes!&quot; Accelerator said this while defusing an explosion that might destroy the city and possibly destroy Last Order/Misaka 20001<br />
<br />
The story: There is this organisation called DA or Disciplinary Action that is like false Antiskill. They say they bring real justice, even though it is not. They use necromancy to bring dead bodies back alive and boost their level and shove them into coffins to create esper robots. Thanks to Esther Rosenthal they are able to use necromancy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330142">
        and were able to create &quot;level 6/god&quot; and of course it is Accelerators job to destroy this organisation even though he doesn&#039;t want to, but he is roped into it after their attempt of kidnapping Last Order and successfully kidnapping one of the Misaka clones.<br />
<br />
Characters: Accelerator is again the same one you expect if you have seen index and railgun. he is still angry and sadistic, but for some reason he cares about Last Order a lot, but damn the man is badass. Last Order is the last Misaka clone created and she is very small and cute. For some reason Accelerator tolerates her even though she is loud and obnoxious at times. Esther Rosenthal is this shows Sakura. She is next to useless and is just annoying. She is the main cause of the attacks towards Accelerator and for the creation of &quot;level 6&quot; esper. <br />
<br />
The ost is very good and the opening is amazing. It is very catchy and the visuals are good.<br />
<br />
The animation in this is very good, maybe it is because these have bigger budgets since Index/Railgun series are popular. The artstyle is good but there is something odd about how the Misaka clones look<br />
<br />
Do you like Accelerator, Index or Railgun? If you do then I recommend this to you.

    Great story. I love brutal MC and he is better that THE MC of this anime series. Accelerator is the coolest MC I think and this anime should have season 2. <br />
<br />
For the character, if you enjoy watching Accelerator you will enjoy the characters in this show as the show is largely focused on Accelerator. Outside of that, Last Order is as cute as ever, the Academy City students got some screen time with Uiharu and Saten, the side characters like Estelle and her corpse doll were fun to watch and misaka clones are always hilarious.<br />
<br />
Some weaknesses however were the villains, all of them were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331082">
        idiots and quite cringey to watch, cant even blame JC Staff on the characterization here, the antagonists were also delusional idiots in the manga as well. Some cops with a completely detached from reality view on justice which was bordering on religious fanaticism, some edgy girls who really hated teachers, and a delusional siscon scientist made up the antagonists. It is clear that the author meant for them to be either throwaway characters or fodder for level 5 espers like the teenage girl assassination squad.

    Academy city is in danger once again and Misaka isn&#039;t here to do it. Now it is the time for Academy City&#039;s greatest esper Accelerator to show how it is done. This took a slight turn from the original Index/Railgun series. This is more dark and gory that the other shows. Why is that? Because Accelerator is as brutal as he is powerful. We aren&#039;t technically following a hero like Misaka since Accelerator is more of an Anti-Hero. He doesn&#039;t do good deeds all the time but he does them from time to time. Like he didn&#039;t massacre the first actual enemies he had. But

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337456">
        when it was time to get angry shit hit the fan real hard. Ain&#039;t nobody want to go against the angry Accelerator unless your name is Touma Kamijou. <br />
<br />
Story: This is some time after Railgun s2 because in that season the Misaka Clone experiment happened and he got his ass kicked. Now he suffers from some weird shit. The story is about Accelerators &quot;redemption&quot; arc, I guess. He now has the biggest quilt in the world because of the many Misakas he had to kill and now he is the &quot;Father&quot; of one Misaka clone who is smaller than everyone else, named Last Order or Misaka 20001. The plot takes a turn from this &quot;villain of the week&quot; style when he meets a necromancer by the name of Esther Rosenthal. Now Academy City is attacked by a group of villains who use Artificial espers. They take a dead esper, hook it up to a machine and now their esper rank also rise. Now Accelerator has to destroy them and they also had kidnapped one Misaka clone. During the last few episodes the entire show was literally grey scaled to show the darkness of the creation of the god or aka a level 10. <br />
<br />
Characters: If you have seen Railgun/Index series then you should know the majority of the characters. They aren&#039;t that changed.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend this to people who like Railgun/Index series.

    Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator is an anime that flew under the radar from most &quot;to-watch&quot; anime lists which initially scared me away from watching this. In a sense; I was afraid it was going to be as bad as &#039;Toaru Majutsu No Index&#039; was. However, after you start watching this anime, you&#039;ll be strangely attached to it. <br />
<br />
Note: Toaru Majutsu no Index henceforth referred to as &#039;Index Series&#039;<br />
<br />
The story is built on the foundation of the Index Series which means that stuff such as abilities, levels of those abilities and characters are already well established. Same goes for the main character &#039;Accelerator&#039;. He is one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315242">
        of the strongest in the Index Series, or rather one of the strongest in &#039;Academy City&#039;. In the main-line series, he&#039;s the antagonist who was tasked to become the first level 6 ESPer. However in this series, the perspective has changed into his; and he is now the protagonist. Due to the fact that the anime has just started; the plot isn&#039;t established very well as of now, so changes might occur.<br />
<br />
The art; now holy crap, this is the part that has surprised me the most. The Index Series are somewhat notorious for being awfully drawn, animated and built. This series turns it all the way around; the art is extremely good. The fighting scenes are amazing and everything looks lively, colorful and most importantly: animated. The city looks and feels urban enough to be passed as a real city, and the characters are also drawn extremely well, facial expressions, hair colors, character design are all amazingly done. And this is in general, because the main-character and co. are also done extremely well, the way the eyes, the hair and the body language of the main-character are animated goes way beyond what J.C. Staff has ever done.<br />
<br />
All characters are somewhat enjoyable, but the best character in this series is the main-character by far. Due to the fact he&#039;s already well established in other animes by J.C. Staff means they couldn&#039;t do a lot wrong, and they haven&#039;t.  Like noted before: the main-character is extremely lively and extremely interesting.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give this anime a solid 8/10 and if the plot develops more (and better) this anime could turn out to be a 9/10. Kudos to J.C. Staff and A.C.G.T.

    Story: What story? I mean I wish I had time to get to know the story. Sadly,  more than half the episodes run time is the main character ignoring dialogue and fighting. Character development should honestly be thrown out the window; Since they change like two parts into it. I would throw some points if it was shonen, but it is not. <br />
Also, they pulled a fairy tail, where the fight scenes are the characters standing still while things move around them for the most part. No intelligence to it, just &quot;whose dick is bigger contest.&quot; Lots of &quot;hahaha no im actually even stronger&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314407">
        will likely continue for the next 8 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: Absolutely Phenomenal. J.C. Staff has never disappointed when it came to art. It isn&#039;t the Death note or Gundam of it&#039;s time. But it is good.<br />
<br />
Sound: *Megumin voice* EXPLOSION! Like constantly, I had no idea dry wall and wind were so fucking loud.<br />
<br />
Charactes: We got your pro-typical under-aged relationship of a pseudo reverse harem. Then we&#039;ve got your dumb American blonde, and hot Japanese guy who is far too cool to engage in character dialogue. Although, it sure would be nice to know a little more about the characters beyond &quot;this is my job to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall, my enjoyment was middle of the lane. This anime would&#039;ve been a hit literally any other time this year. This anime has some STEEP competition unless you have unlimited hours and A+ student attention span. The dialogue isn&#039;t emotional (yet). The fight scenes are unprecedented, unexpected, and sometimes unnecessary. My review is based on three episodes, a rule in the anime community. I&#039;d be lying if I said I will not finish it. But the acting isn&#039;t very good so I will wait for the dub. <br />

    PLS...ITS ACCELERATOR ANIME...obviusly its god...okay im so subjective at this moment...but recently in july i watched the complete toaru-series(index I,II,III,Railgun and Railgun S) and holy fck this anime its so good...<br />
Accelerator its a good protagonist...and Last Order and Esther are so cutee...<br />
Music meeeh...I like more the ending insted the opening...the opening its only good when... &quot;shadow is the light ....... I&#039;ll never change!&quot;...<br />
The art hmmmm...I think that J.C Staff made a good job with the scenaries but  the fights imo are bad animated... I like more Index III fights scenes(im weird I know)...<br />
Of course I´m sad bc this anime deserverd 24 episodes like other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315350">
        of ToAru series...but we have only 12 episodes for enjoy...<br />
I think ( I know its very soon for say it but not matter) ToAru Kagaku no Accelerator really deserves a second season...and pls 24 episodes for Accelerator

    Ok, this is by far my favourite To Aru series character since i saw him. I was super happy, and still am that he got his anime adaptation BUT. Story arc is kinda meh to be honest, animations are also very mediocre and action sequences arent really connected, art itself is good. Accelerator as character is super intersting and fun to watch so for me at least he brings this whole anime up. I really dont understand why they didnt animate this masterfully since its anime about new character and it should have made people hook up with the show, find this guy super intersting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324487">
        and they continue watching whole series, but too bad i guess. Hopefully they make another season or show.

    Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator, or in english, A Certain Scientific Accelerator has a complete focus on one of my favorite antagonists of the Toaru Raildex series, an antagonist who is becoming to learn good via Touyma.<br />
<br />
This season takes place between seasons one and two of a certain magical index. A Certain Scientific Accelerator has a focus on something the other series never touched on, that being necromancy. Basically this series main villain used necromancy to achieve his goal, but that had a twist to it near the end of the series. <br />
<br />
This season features two amazing main characters which originated from the original story, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357347">
        certain magical index. <br />
<br />
In the end, I gave A Certain Scientific Accelerator an 8 out of 10.<br />
<br />

It&#039;s pretty important to watch the previous Index entries before this one.<br />
<br />
Great buildup. New characters are fairly weak in development and personality, while old characters are still sort of strong. <br />
<br />
<br />
The story is believable and the motivations are ok<br />
The art was nice, as always.<br />
The music was pretty good.<br />
The voice acting was great, as always.<br />
<br />
In anime, I usually dislike the main character being super-extremely overpowered, but I enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
I like that Accelerator does not have any hint of romance as his motivations. He has flaws and trust issues that probably befit someone who went through such unknown and numerous abuses in his earlier years. <br />
<br />
Still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322385">
        disappointed there is no explanation as to why he can use magic (his black wings) and his esper powers without major consequences.<br />
<br />
This show was hyping up its end boss for many episodes but it failed to deliver. Everything was pretty good until the ending arc and then it just felt rushed. Disappointing climax, but a good journey.<br />

    Oh my god get me out.<br />
<br />
This show is peak J.C. Staff. I&#039;m literally watching a slideshow Pokemon battle. Never is there ever simultaneous actions taking place, it&#039;s always I attack and you stand still then you attack and then I stand still. And it&#039;s poorly animated at that too, so it ends up feeling like you&#039;re watching a slideshow. I never thought two paramilitary groups duking it out in a futuristic building that escalates into fighting a giant spider mech (episode 5) could look so appallingly stupid.<br />
<br />
Like look, the characters are decent. I&#039;m not a huge fan of the female characters or the niceguy juice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315761">
        they&#039;re feeding Accelerator, but that&#039;s not really an issue. The story is fine, with interesting arcs taking place in the fleshed-out world of Raildex. The issue is that the series fundamentally relies on accelerator being cool (somewhat similarly to One Punch Man), which means the fights have to feel cool.<br />
<br />
But of course, every single fight in the show so far sucks fucking monkey balls.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I finished the show, and yeesh. This show is actually terrible, though I can&#039;t really say I regret it given how meme-tier bad the animation was. All the characters (including Accelerator) end up feeling so incredibly flat it&#039;s unbelievable. Like I get the whole schtick with Accelerator is that he&#039;s supposed to actually be a pretty good guy, but having him go on a rant about being a villain and how villains should act every 3 episodes only for him to act as a perfect hero is incredibly boring. Esther as a character just straight up sucks both figuratively in the sense she&#039;s not really developed outside of &quot;oh no I have to kill my friend that&#039;s already dead anyway&quot; and literally in the sense that she exists to suck off Accelerator and circlejerk how cool he is. Last Order is cute chibi fanservice, nothing to complain about but nothing remarkable either.<br />
<br />
Overall early on when Accelerator&#039;s niceguy juice wasn&#039;t getting old whenever he acted cool the show was actually kinda cool despite the absolutely terrible fight scenes, but as it went on it just became worse and worse. I can&#039;t say my opinion is authoritative or anything like that, but disregarding the terrible fight scenes I would&#039;ve liked to see Accelerator doing stuff that was actually somewhat in a moral gray area and his internal conflicts with regards to that. Alas.<br />
<br />
