    This review is long overdue. I had wrote one earlier but it got deleted so that&#039;s a shame. Anyhow, Super Lovers 2 takes off right after the completion of the first season. Those who have completed the first season should know by now that this relationship is between an adult and a minor. Who are step brothers by registry. So if you know that&#039;s not your cup of tea, don&#039;t give Super Lovers 2 the time of day. You&#039;ll only come to dislike it more because of the couple&#039;s new problems that arise in this season. Most of which yes, involve the age gap and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242891">
        the fact that Ren is still young when compared with Haru. Now if you&#039;re a fan, well that&#039;s great! You&#039;ll love how steamy it becomes between Haru and Ren. The second season covers the Natsuo arc almost flawlessly so his character is fleshed out and understandable.<br />

I am writing this review as a gay individual so I don&#039;t want people to pull the “only gross straight females will enjoy this anime” because that is not the case. I don&#039;t go digging for “LGBT rep” in anime or manga and I especially don&#039;t look for any in BL or Yuri. I enjoy works that have good stories to tell and I don&#039;t base my likeability of the series on if the story has a canon gay couple or anything. If we&#039;re being honest, this is the only BL I&#039;ve ever enjoyed. I&#039;ve tried a few ever since I was younger but none appealed to me. Anyway, I want to make clear before I start this review that people can enjoy any piece of work they want no matter their sexuality or age. We shouldn&#039;t generalize people and I know it does happen but I&#039;ve seen it happen more often than naught with BL works but that&#039;s the way the cookie crumbles. I know I&#039;m preaching to the wind here but my thoughts  and reviews are always full of heart. Enjoy!<br />

The soundtrack was memorable for me! It had a nice country and slice of life feel to it. There were moments where if the scene was funny, a nice melody would play while if the scene was serious, an ominous track would play. I really love the music that was composed for Super Lovers. This season definitely made good use of all the melodies. There was never a moment where music wasn&#039;t playing which I am grateful for. Sometimes in a series, if something serious were to happen, no music would play and personally, I think adding music adds a layer of suspense to a scene. The soundtrack isn&#039;t elegant nor is it &quot;one of its kind&quot; but it definitely is unique. We rarely get such soft music in anime since it&#039;s frequently elegant strings or upbeat tones. I have no problem with either but this anime&#039;s soundtrack is immensely refreshing. Another thing I love about the music is how the actors sing the ending song and they take turns! I know it&#039;s a lot of work for some series to do this so just the fact that the director thought it would be a wonderful thing to do, which it was, isthe best! The ending song and opening song always left you feeling refreshed and in a cheery mood. At least for me. There are definitely some tracks I&#039;m more of a fan of than others. I&#039;m sure if you listen to the music while watching this anime, you&#039;ll find just what I&#039;m talking about when I say a scene feels even better.<br />

I&#039;ve been watching anime since I was a baby so animation isn&#039;t a big deal to me. Though I have to admit, there were some sloppy parts but BL series never seem to get beautiful adaptations with the exceptions of the series being short. Thankfully, Super Lovers had cute end cards and illustrations to make up for such moments. Ahh, they&#039;re so pretty. I loved the ones from the first season so the fact that they did it with season 2 is even better. I believe my favorite animation slip-up is with Natsuo&#039;s mouth in episode 8. Though not too noticeable, it&#039;s there for like half a second. However, I gave it an 8 since the stupid animations got to me and I thought they were unique and laughable. To be honest, the animation could have been far worse. I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all familiar with &quot;yaoi&quot; anatomy. So really, I&#039;m just happy the anatomy was on point! Even in the manga, Abe&#039;s art is simply flawless and beautiful. One of my favorite manga artists really. I&#039;m happy to that see the anime managed to make some moments beautiful. I especially love the shadow on Ren&#039;s nose, it&#039;s a very unique shading style. Tanuki had the best animation. All the budget went to the dog and I&#039;m not even upset. A cute dog deserve grand animation. People that are saying it was horrendous and unwatchable are exaggerating. While the frames were anything but beautiful, it&#039;s not as if we had sliding characters or choppy animation. My only problems lies with the designs for some still frames but other than that, it was watchable and I didn&#039;t mind it at all!<br />
<br />
The characters are memorable! I have so much to say about the relationship between Haru and Ren. We get to learn more about Haru’s past and his personality so that&#039;s definitely a ton of points from me. People complain about Haru going back and forth between viewing Ren as a brother or love interest but the real issue is hardly black or white. It lies within his mental state that even he can&#039;t crack. I don&#039;t blame Haru for not seeing Ren only as a love interest but I do agree that sometimes he can be rough. However, Ren is dense when it comes to other’s influences and the outside world. The Natsuo arc is especially full of this. Ren and Haru both make stupid decisions but I can without a doubt say that I&#039;ve done just as much or even worse than what Ren has done. This season especially digs into Ren’s insecurities and doubtful attitude towards Haru. Ren really loves Haru and Haru really loves Ren but they both have such overwhelming emotions that, speaking from experience, can truly be difficult to convey to a loved one. It&#039;s not Haru’s fault for bouncing between the two feelings he has towards Ren because Haru has attachment issues while Ren knows he unfortunately can&#039;t fill the void in Haru’s heart of having a little brother and someone to take care of. Ren loves him and he just doesn&#039;t want to harm Haru emotionally because of Ren’s own feelings. I can say so much about Haru and Ren and why this season really digs deeper into their personalities and all the insecurities that surround them both as a couple and as brothers.<br />
<br />
The twins are important. Just as the first season, they&#039;re both Haru and Ren’s pillars of support. They make sure Haru doesn&#039;t cross over the line too far while also keeping Ren steady emotionally. They&#039;re like real brothers to Ren and Ren finds a deal of great comfort and reliance on them. Haru on the other hand will try his best as he takes the harsh but truthful words from his brothers. Aki and Shima don&#039;t beat around the bush and are there to support the couple in whatever way possible. The characters are hardly bland and nor is there “no development” because in season one, Aki was more possessive of Haru and seemed to not care one ounce for Ren but this season, he connects with Ren and even provides support for him while agreeing that this time, Haru is the one at fault. Natsuo plays a major role since he pretty much tests Ren’s feelings towards Haru and isn&#039;t afraid to cause an uproar. Compared to the first season which only consisted of minor arguments between Haru and Ren, the second season involves everyone around them. It&#039;s not just their own little world anymore. Natsuo is there to poke at it and challenge them in as many ways as possible. However, Natsuo is hardly just a “fanservice” character. His past is important in providing sufficient evidence for why Haru acts the way he does. <br />
<br />
All in all, don&#039;t overlook the side characters and don&#039;t think the creator doesn&#039;t know what she&#039;s doing. If you just take the time to understand Haru and Ren&#039;s feelings and even listen to what the therapist has to say about them, you&#039;ll see why they&#039;re simply perfect for each other no matter the challenges they come to face. Haru isn&#039;t manipulative and this season further amplifies just how far Ren is willing to go in order to “possess” Haru. He wants this man no matter the cost and will try everything in his power in order to make it happen. Ren is one intelligent individual who knows how to get Haru riled up but some people seem to overlook just how much Ren seems to control what happens behind the scenes. If it wasn&#039;t for Ren and Haru’s insecurities and back and forward personalities than Super Lovers would truly be a bland and generic BL series. Abe makes sure to keep attitudes and reactions realistic to some degree. You have Kiyoka and Juuzen’s initial reactions to Haru and Ren’s relationship and then you have Aki and Shima who eventually accepted the feelings between the two. There are many others but these are a few, minus manga only characters, that immediately come to mind.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this season because all of Ren and Haru’s fights felt so realistic in a sense. Relationships aren&#039;t all candies and rainbows nor are conflicts resolved so easily. I see people getting angry at the fact that conflicts remained unresolved but I&#039;m just confused as to what isn&#039;t resolved? Without spoiling, I can say that no conflict is annoying or childish or overused. The problems that arise really interest me because of how fitting they are with the characters. Ren reacts to a conflict in his own way while Haru tries to understand why Ren did this or that. What I really love is when they both apologize or one apologizes first and that&#039;s hardly anything you see in series. Not just anime or manga but it really reminds of the laughable trope that you can silence your partner if they&#039;re angry just by kissing them. I was never a fan of that because the conflicts were never resolved and it felt like the feelings beforehand were never carried over to their partner. That really isn&#039;t the case for Super Lovers. Haru and Ren care for each other, they value each other’s feelings, they want to support one another in anyway possible and they are both willing to take the blame for anything that goes wrong even if it&#039;s not their fault. That&#039;s a difficult thing to do considering pride exists but both do not care if it means the other will be fine and comfortable again.<br />
<br />
This is my review of season 2! I may add on when I feel like it but I thank anyone so much for reading this far. I say give this season a shot if you liked season one because this one is just a wild ride in general!! Many characters, development and situations that will indeed leave you fulfilled!

    The story has been heavier with dark content. If you&#039;re not into yaoi, age-gap ship , You better stay away from this anime instead of stepping here only to leave bad review while you&#039;re not even the target audiences<br />
<br />
I love there&#039;s more drama with Haru and Ren and now Ren is 17, ready with sex but Haru still think it&#039;s too early for Ren to have sex<br />
<br />
I like Natsuo and tbh, I guess he&#039;s more attractive than Haru<br />
<br />
AGAIN, I WARN YOU. IF YOU&#039;RE NOT A FUJO, NOT OKAY WITH AGE-GAP SHIP OR THINK THIS IS INCEST, I WARN YOU TO  STAY AWAY FROM HERE<br />

    (SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
Okay, I just finished the last episode today, and all I can say is that I was incredibly disappointed. When I watched the first season of Super Lovers, I can definitely say that I was intrigued. The plot was somewhat interesting and it was a yaoi (i tend to have a huge interest and liking in this genre). But boy oh boy, this season was complete.... trash. I am so disappointed to say that, but I can&#039;t lie to myself and say that I enjoyed it, because I really really wanted to. I had to give such low scores because honestly, that is exactly what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242798">
        I felt. As I watched each episode as they came out week by week, I would try to hard to hold back my cringes and push them to the side, but now I am just coming out and confronting them. <br />
<br />
First things first, let&#039;s begin with the story. Okay, so if I&#039;m wrong, the main focus is centered around Haru and Ren&#039;s relationship as a... couple? Brotherly love? Honestly, I don&#039;t even know. I continued to stay confused throughout the entire season because it would go back and fourth between each &quot;conflict&quot;. One time, Haru would be talking about how Ren is his brother, and then the next time he would be kissing him and talking about something that doesn&#039;t even really correlate to the story? Oh, and speaking of Haru, things got somewhat interesting as the conflict with his parents came up. He had to go see a psychologist and he was faced with a REAL problem. But... they never really touched on it after that? I mean, it was brought up and he was being asked to go back, but after that, there was really no more insight. And when episode 10 finished up, the final shot came up on the screen that read &quot;Thank you for watching Super Lovers&quot;, and I was soooo confused. It was over? Already? I felt so incomplete and just... incredibly disappointed. I literally had to search up if it really ended there, and when I found out it did, I instantly deflated. What about Natsu? What about Haru and Ren&#039;s relationship? What about Ren in general? I was left completely empty. There were so many plot holes in this series, it is almost impossible to count. I gave the story a rating of 3, and that&#039;s just being considerate to all of the things that aren&#039;t included in everything that was WRONG with the story. <br />
<br />
Okay, moving onto art. I gave this a rating of 2 because JESUS... It is so... dreadful. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks this.. I wish I could insert pictures of screenshots of all the scenes that I cringed at. The art was so bad that I was legitimately wondering if it had been messily sketched and colored the night before by someone who was running off of 5 cups of coffee and energy drinks. Jesus, in most of the scenes, Haru&#039;s nose was completely MISSING and everyone&#039;s eyes were a solid block of color. The only decent art was in the opening and closings, SOME close-ups, and scenes where Haru and Ren were being &quot;intimate&quot;. I really don&#039;t have much to say further than just WOW. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m skipping sound because.. Idk what I can say about that?<br />
<br />
Character, I gave a 4. I wasn&#039;t too sure how to rate this because I wasn&#039;t sure if my judgement is worthy of any score lower. This was probably the most confusing rating I can give because of all of the plot holes and missing information I don&#039;t have. Throughout the series, Haru acted like a piece of trash that treated Ren like he was his lost puppy. The whole &quot;clueless overprotective dad&quot; scheme he put on throughout the episodes made me want to jump off of my house, and the way Ren really NEVER stood up for himself made it even worse. Haru has a really trash-like personality and the way that it was never resolved bugs the hell out of me! When the series ended, I kind of laughed because there was absolutely ZERO character development. I guess that just means that Haru really is just a stingy clueless man. Ren is a smart boy, but sometimes the things he did made me stuff a pillow in my face and question why the universe had made me this way. Like, why couldn&#039;t I just be as dumb as him and think &quot;yeah, this is a good idea!&quot; specifically, I&#039;m talking about the whole &quot;sex with natsu because haru wont have sex with me&quot; ordeal. Instant facepalm. And this is a little off-topic, but Haru&#039;s constant whining about Ren not sleeping with him would always annoy the hell out of me. <br />
<br />
ANYWAYS, this anime gave me a really sad and empty feeling. You know when you haven&#039;t eaten in a couple hours and there&#039;s no food around so you kind of have to just sulk and deal with it? Yeah, that&#039;s how it made me feel. I can&#039;t really do anything about how I am feeling because there&#039;s nothing to fill that empty hole with. <br />
I can compare this to an anime like Say I Love You or Orange. They are both romance animes with conflict (like Super Lovers). The only difference with those animes and this one is that yes, they had conflict, but they were RESOLVED and actually made sense without leaving me a confused mess. When it comes to Super Lovers, I have no idea if their conflict was resolved or not... In episode ten, was Natsu kissing Haru and Ren getting upset and yelling &quot;This is mine!!!&quot; the resolution? It&#039;s the only conclusion I can come up with. <br />
<br />
I am so sad that it had to be this way, because I genuinely wanted to like this anime..  I think the main issue here was that there was only 10 episodes in this season. There could&#039;ve been so much more growth and development with the characters and story line if it had the regular 25 episodes like most animes, but I understand if it was money issues or something related that hindered that from being able to happen.. I don&#039;t really have anything else to say except that I am really sad that I didn&#039;t get to grow attached to this anime. The direction and overall theme or whatever that the anime is mainly &#039;about&#039; goes right up my alley! If only it was better and more carefully written, I really could see the potential and success it could&#039;ve had.

    Personally, I found the second season better than the first one. I think, it had more character development than the first season of Super Lovers, this also may be because of Ren, both is possible. <br />
As for the story line, it kind of repeats the events of the first season, the insecurities Ren had, were really repetitive. which honestly was kind of tiring. <br />
Things though take a nice twist in few of the last episodes of the season. It really shows the bond between Haru and Ren, I actually think it&#039;s the first time, we see the development in Ren&#039;s character which wasn&#039;t clear in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255641">
        the other episodes. <br />
Overall, I gave this anime an eight because it was both nice and annoying. I can&#039;t say I didn&#039;t enjoy it cause I would be lying. It&#039;s a relaxing anime to watch, which includes a nice and cute love story!

    [SPOILERS - sorry]<br />
I didn&#039;t write a review of the first season, because that was fairly fine. I had my problems with it (every cringe worthy moment with child Ren geez), but it didn&#039;t go deep enough into the story to actually get mad over it. Well, that changed with this season.<br />
<br />
The story tries to concentrate on the problem between Haru and Ren, why they aren&#039;t going forward even though living together, mostly sleeping in the same bed, etc. And with that, the poor writing just comes to the surface, because the storyteller obviously has no idea what is the problem, so they are just hitting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242108">
        around the bush over and over again. <br />
<br />
When the problem is so CLEAR. It is Haru. This fucked up, dumb, self centered douchebag. You can argue with me, that his trauma made him this way, but I do not care. Nobody is making him realize that he is acting out, nobody is stopping him from lashing out on Ren. And with the 8th ep, fucking Aki even told Ren that go easy on him, because it&#039;s a hard time for him. FUCK THAT. I live for every moment when Ren tries to call Haru out on his bullshit, but the writers are so bad at what they are doing that it just gets pushed back to the corner everytime and never really discussed. <br />
<br />
What Haru is doing is disgusting. I am not okay with the idea that a 24yo going at it with a minor, but well, that could be handled well. It is not in this story. Haru keeps bouncing between looking at Haru as his baby brother, and a potential body that he can use for sexual attempts whenever he feels like it. And that is one of the key points with him, only when HE feels like it. He keeps pushing Ren to the limit, the poor kid wants him so bad, but Haru just backtracks everytime. And then calls Ren practically a slut when he goes and tries to get experience elsewhere, because he heard 100times that he is an inexperienced baby. Haru is an utterly self centered man, who can&#039;t be considerate while pretends that he cares for everybody. And yet, the story favors him over Ren who is actually doing his freaking best here. <br />
<br />
I always thought that in yaoi the uke is the absolutely annoying one, but this story proved me wrong, there is nothing worse than a seme who can&#039;t make up his fucking mind. And you know, after all this - especially the 8th ep because he even went as far as telling Ren, a kid who was abandoned, that he doesn&#039;t need to come home if he sleeps with Natsuo, that&#039;s just so low that I needed to wait two days to go back and continue the ep - he doesn&#039;t deserve Ren. This story should end up with Ren walking away. And it won&#039;t, and that makes it horrendous. <br />
<br />
And I don&#039;t know, I might want too much from anime, but if you make stories about two men in love, can&#039;t you just avoid shit like shaming trans people? I know that it&#039;s normal in Japan, I watch enough tv shows to see how they treat real life trans women, but I hate that even stories like this just use them as a joke. Even though one of them is a really important character in Haru&#039;s life. <br />
<br />
So there are many parts in this story that just makes you cringe if you aren&#039;t used to yaoi, or just you know, actually have some respect for the LGBT community. Yes, I know, I shouldn&#039;t watch shit like this if I want that... but come at me with something else that has representation? I&#039;m gonna sprint to watch it... <br />
<br />
To mention some positive things about the characters... I really like Aki and Shima, and the school nurse guy is funny. Story-wise they are doing a pretty poor job, though. Nobody is telling shit to Haru, and the nurse just avoids helping Ren with his sexual questions, which is a pretty shitty thing to do when you are supposed to be an aid for kids. But they are the good kind of comical relief, so I like their comments. Especially the twins tsukkomi moments at their stupid brother. I just really wish they actually had a part in the story. <br />
<br />
The art is nice, the sound- well, I have no idea, so it can&#039;t be too good, I don&#039;t remember any bgm. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll wait for the end of the season to actually give it a rate, but it won&#039;t be better than 5. This is not how you should picture gay people. Or I don&#039;t know, is Ren demisexual??? Is Haru bisexual? Ah, I really wan&#039;t too much from anime x&quot;DD <br />
<br />
So that&#039;s that. It does not deserve the almost 8 points. Only watch this if you are a hardcore fan of yaoi, otherwise gonna get mad A LOT. <br />
<br />
(istg I&#039;m not watching yaoi anymore.)

    Story: was very well done excellent job👍<br />
Art: was beautiful and well suited to this anime<br />
Sound: it was not anything outstanding but it suited the mood and atmosphere of the anime<br />
Characters: are very good and their relations are delt with very well <br />
Enjoyment: I marathoned the whole 2nd season in just one day that&#039;s all I&#039;m gonna say 😘<br />
Overall ➡️This is so underrated. Surprisingly this anime manages to surprise me since I thought this anime might disturb me but everything is handled so well that you really end up wishing for their happy ever after. (The character growth is well executed) This season was much better

    I was really looking forward to seeing this anime. I absolutely loved Season 1 so I had high expectations for this one. <br />
<br />
I ended up being disappointed.<br />
<br />
It went quite downhill from the first season. Character development is non-existent and it&#039;s just the same events recurring in different scenarios. While I do understand that the anime is revolved around Haru, being the eldest brother, and Ren, being the youngest brother, having some sort of relationship between them, it was still very confusing. I couldn&#039;t tell throughout the whole anime if they&#039;re in a relationship, brotherly love or just desperate for lust. I&#039;m going with the third

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257344">
        one though. <br />
<br />
Every time there&#039;s sexual tension between Haru and Ren, something interrupts them and it was getting quite boring. I get it, it&#039;s Shounen Ai not Yaoi but the scenes were quite silly.<br />
<br />
They were traits of manipulation coming from Haru and while Ren was trying to be rebellious, he still fell for Haru. This is what I meant when I said character development is non-existent and the same events. It&#039;s just; Ren wants to do it with Haru, Haru doesn&#039;t YET he leads him on, Ren rebels, Haru punishes and the cycle repeats itself.<br />
<br />
I hope they will work more on Season 3 [if there will be one]. I&#039;m not giving up on his anime.

    Right after I watched the first episode of this anime, I already had a feeling that I am going to love this series. And man! I was right. This show was really so good I’ve given it’s first season a 9 out of 10 stars rating, *wink. Super Lovers have a total of 2 seasons, both with 10 episodes each and an OVA with 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the first yaoi that I have watched, I realized that I prefer 1 couple per show, and man! I can’t be happy enough that I am having that in this anime. Super Lovers gives us a very sweet (and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279753">
        sometimes funny) narration on Haru and Ren’s romantic relationship.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I started this series, I was actually kind of confused with Haru and Ren’s relationship. It was really unusual and kind of nauseating (?) when you really think hard about the technicalities but with those wonderful graphics and the couple’s chemistry, it’s hard to dwell on that thought for long. So yep, as early as the first episode, I already accepted the fact that Haru and Ren belong to each other. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I am not going to explain more about that, instead, I’ll tell you that the age gap is really big. But that’s normal in yaoi anyway so I guess it’s fine.<br />
<br />
I don’t like stories with amnesia in it so I guess that’s the only thing I hated on the first season of this anime. The scenes we’re nicely done and I love how Haru and Ren’s relationship were progressing. And yes, you can definitely expect massive number of funny scenes in this anime in both seasons 1 and 2 as well as on its OVAS. As for the season 2, I actually don’t love it as much I love season 1, but I still ended up giving it an 8 out of 10 stars rating because in that season, it really focused on their relationship (a boy to boy relationship). And yes, there’s definitely a lot of times the S thing was mentioned which eventually became an issue to both the main characters. In relation to that, I really feel sorry (while laughing my heart out, haha) to a certain school nurse who’s always subjected to Ren’s question about a certain topic (it starts with S, haha) that is so awkward for a guy to answer, haha.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thinking back, I think it was a pretty good angle for season 2 because Haru and Ren’s relationship were really progressing. There were also some references to things couples do (if you get what I mean? haha) but it was usually done in a funny way so you won’t definitely feel uncomfortable. And nope, there’s definitely no explicit scenes here (but I think almost?, haha), but I’m still issuing you a warning though, because some kissing scenes we’re HOT AF! (Awww! haha)<br />
<br />
<br />
I love the graphics of this anime. Of all the yaoi (and possibly all the anime) I have watched, Super Lovers done it so perfectly. I’m a very visual person so imagine how my eyes turned into heart shapes every time I watch this anime. I just love everything – the character design (Haru’s definitely looks like Adonis and Ren is so cute I want to get him out of the screen and hug him), the animation, everything! And the music isn’t that bad either, *wink. Most yaoi anime features animals in them, and for this anime, it’s a dog!<br />
<br />
<br />
I don’t have any complaints about the characters either because my eyes were feasting on their good looks its hard to get mad at them, haha. But seriously, I don’t have any characters that I hated so much I want to kill them. Ofcourse there we’re some characters that was kind of against Haru and Ren’s complicated relationship but that’s normal, atleast in the end they we’re able to understand and eventually accept it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Super Lovers is definitely one of my top yaoi anime recommendations, curious? You’ve got to check it out!<br />
<br />
PS: It’s not a pedo, you need to watch the anime or read the manga before jumping into that conclusion, please!

    Many adult jokes and mature scene but not hentai so it&#039;s still safe. Still, I don&#039;t recommend you if you&#039;re still under 18 but I believe people who come to see Super Lovers 2 must have watched the first season and wanted to see more Haru and Ren.<br />
<br />
Just like S1, the story still revolves around Kaidou brothers, focusing more on Haru and Ren but now, Aki and Shima got their spotlights with a few dramas. What I like the most is that this second season doesn&#039;t lose its sense of humor.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a new important character which will come in between Haru and Ren that I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376666">
        expected some sort of a love triangle drama. <br />

The art is just getting better with more character development. Who knows that Aki can be a brocon towards Ren. Overall 10/10

    To be honest, it&#039;s not good. The music is limited and heavy handed. And it was way too long. Most of it was worthless events that have no real impact. On top of that, the actors sound out of it, tired. I still enjoyed it (just because I think it&#039;s cute,) but it&#039;s still not very good. <br />
It&#039;s what you expect from BL, tbh. Just barely good enough to skim by...<br />
Also, in a certain episode, one of the characters does something pretty wrong to Ren. Something that certainly should have pissed Haru off, but he didn&#039;t even recognise his involvement. <br />
There was also a mostly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327120">
        worthless beach episode.<br />
Spoiler- they don&#039;t fuck. And they only have one explictly sexual theme, so.

    This isn&#039;t much of a review. I love this series. I&#039;ve watched it three times with year or two gaps. I&#039;m gay. The first time I got called a gay slur was in second grade at eight years old. I didn&#039;t fall in love until I was 30. To see a young person who knows what he feels and is free to be in love... If only the world I grew up in was like that. I root for Ren to get through to Haru  and cheer when he does. Obviously, I&#039;m predjudiced. I&#039;m so glad Japanese culture is capable of recognising the truth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399892">
        of this story. It&#039;s a truth too many would like to deny. And keeping it secret has been harmful to so many millions... yes, millions... of people. This story gives me hope there&#039;ll be a better future.

    Where do I even begin with the 2nd Season of Super Lovers, somehow it&#039;s even worse than season 1. It takes all of the problems from season 1,  no plot, lack of development of main characters, and overall creep factor and multiplies it by 10. Ren is becoming a young adult and he wants to start pulling his own weight, but everytime he tries to take a step forward there&#039;s something (someone) holding him  back. That someone is Haru, and like others have said he&#039;s a big problem  in this series in season 1, but this again is amplified in season 2.<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367421">
        guess the problem for me is Haru&#039;s characterization, again he doesn&#039;t really change much in this season, there not really any satisfying explanation as to why he is the way he is other than quick snippets of what happened to his mom and stepdad, his own trauma never was expanded upon and in some ways it seems obvious that his trauma was never dealt with healthily but we aren&#039;t shown to how it affects him now other than a vague health problem that is never mentioned after said episode even after we are told he&#039;s completely healthy. Strangely enough for  a flat protagonist, his moods change in an instant almost like Jekyll and Hyde, in one moment he acts like a caring and concerning person who&#039;d do everything for his brothers and in the next moment when nobody is watching he turns into a self serving jerk who only seems to care about satisfying himself and not about how his actions and words can affect Ren(an abused minor nonetheless), someone he claims to care about. <br />
<br />
Here we&#039;re introduced to a *rival* Natsuo, but like the other characters in the story except for maybe Ren, he doesn&#039;t have a lot of development. He plays second fiddle to Haru, and we learn nothing about him until the last episode. Just as soon as he&#039;s introduced in the story, he kinda fades to back ground when he&#039;s served his role as rival. <br />
Natsuo probably does better to do his own thing than be jealous, at least he seems more self aware than some people.<br />
<br />
The major disappointment of the season was seeing how Ren, was essentially blocked at every opportunity to improve his life and perhaps deal with his own trauma and insecurities just because Haru was being selfish and petty. Haru gets mad at Ren&#039;s recklessness but takes no responsibility in allowing the situation to happen, it&#039;s no secret that teens who aren&#039;t properly taught about sex ed, tend to make mistakes, had Haru been honest I doubt it would have played out like it did. Course if Ren was taught proper sex education, then he&#039;d know about consent, which is likely why Ren isn&#039;t allowed to learn said subject cause it&#039;s not in Haru&#039;s agenda to ever be held accountable for his actions cause he&#039;s perfect and pretty and never does anything wrong. <br />
<br />
I like characters like Ren, and if he were in another genre, his story would likely be a lot different. But because this a romance show and characters can&#039;t live without each other without dieing,(actual quote). I&#039;ll feel like he&#039;ll never get the ending he deserves, because let&#039;s face it Haru is an abuser and he doesn&#039;t seem to feel much remorse because he does the same thing over and over again. Doesn&#039;t matter if Ren is 15 or 150, what Haru&#039;s doing is wrong and sets a tone for how unhealthy relationships start, especially in the LGBT community with the stereotypes of bisexual people being inherently promiscuous or that gay men are predators.<br />

    Super Lovers 1 and 2 or “The glorification of pedophilia”. <br />
Two seasons of this dreadful anime and I watched them both in full trying to believe what I was seeing. <br />
<br />
We have a super intelligent male teenager - Ren - placed under guardianship in a family of young men. The boy had been abandoned, mistreated and deeply traumatized as young child before he came into the care of a Canadian female scientist living in the woods. For reasons that escape me, this child does not get counseling or professional psychological help learning to deal with this early trauma, but what do I know? Through circumstance,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365482">
        Ren is later adopted into a Japanese family consisting of Haru - the oldest brother, a 24-year-old man and the son of the Canadian scientist - and his male twin half-brothers in their late teens/ later early twenties. <br />
<br />
What I think they were trying to depict is that in a relationship the older is not necessarily the more mature; and that a teenager can be firm in his desires and sexual orientation. That would have been ok. But. <br />
<br />
Despite the pretty visuals, good music, and good dubbing, what we then see is how the adult man, the person expected to protect his younger siblings and ward, is a pedophile. Ren imprinted on Haru as 8-year-old since Haru was the first male to treat him kindly and with affection when he visited Canada. His feelings last into teenage years; he is in love with Haru and asks for a sexual relation. We then follow how Ren and Haru share a bedroom and the same bed daily. Haru initiates kisses on the mouth in private and in public and is otherwise overstepping the boundaries between caring, comforting and sexual intimacy. The twins and other side characters are entirely ok with this behavior; they laugh at their older sibling and excuse his naivete. <br />
<br />
How is this story ok? <br />
<br />
Why should we accept that the boy – this underage child - is being preyed upon and that his isolated upbringing following the childhood trauma gives him little protection from the advances of a man that he trusts and who is legally responsible for him? In a very cute way, this anime promotes pedophilia and makes it seem ok that an adult shares intimacy with a child; It does not help that Ren although about 15/16 is stunted and looks like an 11-year old. There would be an uproar if we would see a teenage girl looking 11 sleep next to her male guardian in the same bed and see how he takes intimate liberties. Many people would realize that that storyline is unacceptable yet just because Ren is a boy, we should think it cute or right or acceptable when an adult is out of bounds. <br />
<br />
The whole time I have been waiting for someone from the sidelines to step in and stop this atrocity instead of seeing the other characters smile, support this behavior and go along with it. When there was the opportunity, I chanted in my head: &quot;Go to Switzerland! Go to Switzerland!&quot;. <br />
<br />
I wish that Ren had left Japan at that opportunity, be educated in Switzerland and work with the researchers at CERN, get distance and more life experience, explore his sexuality with peers, grow a head taller than Haru, bulk up, then return at 18 and see how things played out. That would have been healthy(er) – and maybe even a good story. <br />
I wish more viewers would protest and speak up to protect boys from abuse as much as girls. <br />

    I dropped this anime a long time ago, but I want to share my thoughts on why I never finished this show, even though I somehow finished the first season, God knows why I did.<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS MAY APPEAR*<br />
<br />
STORY (3/10):<br />
To be honest, the story was pretty trash. This season, was basically centered around Ren and Haru&#039;s relationship (which I have a lot to say about that later on), but nothing made sense to me. The story was pretty much all over the place, there&#039;s too many plot holes and barely to no resolutions to anything that is told. Just poor writing overall. There&#039;s more I can say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352968">
        about the story but this would be an essay! This gets a 3 from me.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10):<br />
The art is probaly the only positive thing i&#039;m gonna say about this anime. I did like it and the colour scheme is nice. Animaton had good and bad days. That&#039;s all really.<br />
<br />
SOUND (6/10):<br />
Sound is okay... I guess lmao.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (3/10):<br />
Girl...I have a lot to say on this section; especially on Haru and Ren, and their relationship. <br />
I know some may feel a type of way for me saying this but I&#039;m just gonna say it...Ren and Haru&#039;s relationship is WRONG. I&#039;m sorry. Haru is such an unlikable character, why is he pursuing a relationship with Ren who is underage and he&#039;s an adult? I just don&#039;t know how people are cool with that? I get that age of consent is different in Japan, but it doesn&#039;t make it morally right, you know? Throughout the show, Haru came off as a weirdo, very manipulative and forceful, at times having a go or being mean to Ren for no reason and pushing himself on him. There were definitely times where I just wanted my punch him through my computer screen, if only it were possible. He&#039;s just a terrible person. As for Ren, I feel bad for him because he&#039;s doing his best to keep Haru pleased and stuff, but he&#039;s really not doing anything wrong and I kinda wish he saw that, even though sometimes he would put Haru in his place, but still. I was kinda hoping he would&#039;ve saw how much of a trashbag Haru was. I also hate the fact that the writiers were pushing this &#039;brother love&#039; concept on Haru and Ren as they&#039;re step brothers, but they&#039;re in a relationship?... Make it make sense please. Even though they&#039;re not blood related, they&#039;re still family...its just didn&#039;t and still doesn&#039;t sit well with my spirit. I wish they didn&#039;t mix those two concepts together because they don&#039;t flow, like pick a struggle. I really hate this relationship.<br />
As for the other characters, they were either there for the sake of plot, or pretty forgettable. Some funny moments with them, but really had nothing to do with the whole story. Overall, the characters were either pretty weak or bs.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (3/10):<br />
There wasn&#039;t a lot to enjoy about this, there&#039;s a lot more negatives than positives, how I watched 7/10 epsiodes, heck, even the first season is beyond me. *Sighs*<br />
<br />
OVERALL (3/10):<br />
To conclude, I didn&#039;t like this season at all. Even though season one is no better, it was slightly more bearable to watch. I don&#039;t know what more I can say about this other than the writers need to do better, MUCH better. Better characters, espiecially with a better and APPROPRIATE love story, and better story telling. If you&#039;re a hardcore Fujoishi or yaoi lover, you may be able to bare with this, I guess. However, if not, I do not recommend this. If I were you, save your time and energy, because there will be times you will get pissed off like I did.<br />

    The show is awesome.<br />
I really loved the scene when Natsuo kissed Haru and it really was out of the ordinary.<br />
This show is outstanding and  fantastic and mind blowing.<br />
Every little detail shown in the show is great.<br />
The school doctor of Ren makes really great expressions and it really is awesome.<br />
I really enjoyed this show.<br />
This show breaks the chains of old orthodox society and really such shows should be made so that people can truly understand themselves and  what they want.<br />
The teens shown looks like minor characters but the task the do is that of main characters sometimes and the way they perform on screen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397183">
        is awesome.<br />
Haru our hero and Ren the second protagonist of our story are in the world of their own an di truly enjoy watching them.<br />
It feels  like I am there in the scenes and am seeing with my own eyes and experiencing the exact.<br />
This is among the few shows where I remember the names of the cast and that is really awesome and tells how good this show really is. things that are happening on the screen.

    This is a very hard show to accurately review. For starters: do not come here if you think adopted non-biological siblings is &quot;incest&quot;. And if you dislike age-gaps within couples or disliked Hitorijime My Hero for the same reason, you will dislike Super Lovers. Don&#039;t get into this anime because you&#039;ll be disappointed. <br />
<br />
(weirdly Ren and Haru are actually closer in age than Kousuke and Masahiro. Masahiro and Ren are the exact same age in the second season. Haru is 24 and Kousuke is 27. Just this animation style makes Ren seem a lot &quot;younger&quot; than Masahiro looks in Hitorijime My Hero.)<br />
<br />
Now, if you&#039;re a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420511">
        western fujioshi here for the kissing and smut similar to Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, you will also be disappointed. If you&#039;re western and coming to subbed anime for the first time, again, you&#039;ll be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Still around? Good. Because this show is really a strange gem. The relationship between Ren and Haru is subtle, and this story largely relies on the feelings of these two characters as they finally live together and interact on a daily-basis, rather than some over-arching grand plot with an end goal. It is, essentially, slice of life BL - with a little background drama. <br />
<br />
For people confused at the dynamic between them, Ren has never seen Haru as a brother, and he makes this fact clear to Haru and everybody around them by using &quot;suki&quot; when referring to his feelings for Haru. Now, we see no problem with this reading the subtitles, but this is important in the sense that people in Japan don&#039;t often say suki directly to people, especially family. It&#039;s often kept for a romantic sense, or talking about your favourite film or food casually. Ren ~clearly~ draws the line with his feelings to people around them, and Haru is just a bit of an airhead that tries to act like an adult and ignores the feelings he has, and knows Ren has. Because yeah, it&#039;s age gap - but Haru knows going too far with Ren is legally a crime in Japan (age of consent for an over 24 year old person &quot;Haru&quot; is 20. And &quot;Ren&quot; is 17. Even when he turned 18 in the manga, legally Haru can&#039;t touch him.)<br />
<br />
So this story is basically &quot;I love them, and I want to monopolise the other person, but I can&#039;t cross that line yet because they/I&#039;m a child, but they/I don&#039;t act like a child.&quot; <br />
<br />
Now, getting around all that, and how the subs do a terrible job showing you that; this is a good anime. It surprisingly tackles themes of &quot;what does a family really mean?&quot;, domestic abuse, feral children and early socialisation, PTSD from a traffic accident, and tackling the guilt behind what is simply an &quot;accident&quot; and the shame of victim-blaming within that. It tackles social norms and how difficult it can be for some people to follow them, and how PTSD can trap people within a certain age mindset. It even tackles where a parent draws the line between being &quot;themselves&quot; and being a &quot;mom&quot;. <br />
<br />
This anime is incredibly deep, and I didn&#039;t give it the justice it deserved when I watched it as a teenager, nor did I pay attention to the subtlety of the characters and the animations between them.<br />
<br />
That all being said; this is very much like Hitorijime My Hero. The characters are ~flawed~ and with those flaws come mistakes, and ugly emotions and behaviours we experience in order to learn and grow from them, and make no mistake - Haru and Ren and the rest of the cast absolutely grow from their fights and their ugly feelings that could leave veiwers banging their heads against their desks. But this anime is ultimately about their journey from these dark corners of their minds into a more healthy environment and mindset. And it&#039;s wonderful watching the characters interact that way. <br />
<br />
Sadly, it isn&#039;t perfect. I, too, want to bash my head against the desk when Ren is being obstinate, or when Haru is being dense, but without smoke, there isn&#039;t fire. And I appreciate the anime for what it does right in the end. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion: Age-gap or &quot;incest&quot; put you off? Don&#039;t watch it. Slice of life bore you? Don&#039;t watch it. New to subtitles and Japanese wording? Put it on the back-burner for now. <br />
<br />
But if you&#039;re happy to find a well-animated, linear, actual-BL anime that isn&#039;t just &quot;brotherly&quot; love and you&#039;ve scoured the internet for most of it before coming here? Give it a shot. You&#039;ve lost nothing trying it out. <br />
<br />
For manga readers - the Manga begins from the anime at chapter 20. (however the manga is more graphic, and they&#039;ve been much more intimate in the manga by that point in the anime.)
