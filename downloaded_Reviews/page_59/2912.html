    First of all, this series is a LOT different from &amp;quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&amp;quot;. While the card game was certainly present in this series, it wasn&#039;t nearly as important. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of changes from this to Duel Monsters. Mokuba&#039;s character is 100% different, Kaiba is somehow more of a jerk, Yugi is tinier and he gets beat up one per episode. And Yami challenges people to shadow games, which end in insanity or death.<br />
<br />
The episodes are really predictable, for the most part. One of the main characters is picked on, Yami challenges them to a shadow game and wins, the episode ends. Even so,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5351">
        it&#039;s fun to watch, because the bad guys always get what they deserve. And you get to see some real action as opposed to half an hour of children&#039;s card games. Also Joey crossdresses.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this show to both fans and haters of Duel Monsters. If you liked the other series, you&#039;ll really like this one because it fills in a lot of missing information. If you hate the other series, then you&#039;ll probably like this because of the action and actual plot.<br />
<br />
The art is okay and the sound track is nothing special (except for the song that plays when Yami is being awesome). I gave it a ten for enjoyment because...I LOVED this show. I&#039;m such a geek, I know, but really, I had a lot of fun watching this. Hopefully you will too.

    Heck, I&#039;ve been a big player of Yu-Gi-Oh! since the game came out. I never wanted to get hooked on it but I did anyways. Basically, Yu-Gi-Oh is one of those many animes that big named companies makes money off of with collectable cards, toys, and what nots. But before we all came to know the Yu-Gi-Oh! that 4Kids TV showed us on the WB channel every morning, there was a series that started it all way before the Cards were the all so important factor of the show. This was the Original Yu-Gi-Oh thread, to many it&#039;s known as the Zero Season.<br /><br />In Yu-Gi-Oh! we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review133">
        meet young little Yugi Moto. Like in the show here he was introduced as a kind and loving friend to Tea (Anzu), Joey (Jonouchi), and Tristan (Honda). There is also another character that was forgotten to be shown as well, Miho Nosaka. Miho is another of Yugi&#039;s friends that usually hangs around Tristan or Tea. <br /><br />Yugi finds the Millennium Puzzle in his families Game Store and decides to build it. The box says &quot;who ever is able to complete this Puzzle will gain the powers of the Dark and one wish will come true&quot;. Yugi finishes the Puzzle and wishes for Friendship. Then the dark spirit, Yami, grants him this wish and protects Yugi&#039;s friends from dangerous Bullies, Gansters, Rich Snobs, and demented Criminals.<br /><br />Unlike the Yu-Gi-Oh! you see on TV, this is way different then what I expected. Yami, which we all see as the super good guy is a crazy psycopathic killer in this series. Always playing mind games and then killing his opponent. He is some King of Games. This is one to check out.

    Overview: That other Yugioh series, the one you probably didn&#039;t see.<br />
<br />
First a little background,<br />
<br />
If you grew up in the 1990s, you probably saw at least a few episodes of Yugioh, the anime about children playing a poor man&#039;s version of Magic the Gathering featuring holographic monsters and rules that seem to change every episode. Yugioh was localized in the US by the infamous and now thankfully defuct company 4kids. All dark plot points involving death and people getting sent to hell were removed, and replaced with references to the &quot;shadow realm&quot;. This is similar to early US dubs of Dragonball Z where in every god

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158051">
        damned episode someone was getting sent to &quot;another dimension&quot;. 4kids even made awkward edits where guns were photoshopped out and guards simply pointed at characters, although obviously they were supposed to be holding something.<br />
<br />
Finally, the part where I actually review season zero:<br />
<br />
However, even the &quot;uncut&quot; version without the overzealous editing of 4kids wasn&#039;t that dark. The Yugioh that was popular in the US was intentionally a kid friendly show. This could NEVER be said about the first Yugioh series, also known as season zero. Comparing season zero to the later Yugioh series would be almost like comparing Berserk to Pokemon. Season zero is deliciously dark and morbid, with the main character callously murdering people in nearly every episode. Even if you disliked Yugioh as a kid, season zero will make you chuckle. Card games aren&#039;t nearly as important in season zero, and Yami is portrayed as the king of all games in general, not just card games. Almost every episode he challenges some poor soul to a new twisted survival challenge and ends up killing them like fucking Jigsaw. This show is pretty dark and twisted for a shonen genre, but I personally find it hilarious. Watching it is like learning that there was an original version of Disney&#039;s Recess that was  R rated and dark as hell. Wouldn&#039;t you want to at least watch a few episodes for a laugh? The art is mediocre and lacks the polish of the later series, but who doesn&#039;t love Kaiba&#039;s green hair? No seriously, he has fucking green hair! The soundtrack is actually quite good with an absolutely amazing opening theme by Field of View. The characters and plot are obviously a bit different, but I actually like this version a lot better. If you vaguely remember Yugioh, but won&#039;t watch it because, &quot;that&#039;s just a baby show&quot;, I think season zero might have you laughing and applauding in no time!

    Children&#039;s Card Games Saga Part I: A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Away, Where Everyone Has Crazy Hair<br />
<br />
Well, it&#039;s been a long time since I did a nostalgia review, and it took me so long to finish this series due to being unable to find synced audio and video versions of the show, I feel like I can be nostalgic about this show now. (Seriously, I had to quit watching this show for 6 months)<br />
<br />
Anyway- so back in 1998, Yugioh was born. Not the 4Kids Yugioh I grew up watching in the early 2000s, but the version that nobody in the US ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review201673">
        saw- what we know as Season 0. Though it sports the Yugioh name, this show and Yugioh Duel Monsters are almost nothing alike- though you can see where many of the ideas for Duel Monsters came from in this- an homage of sorts for the Japanese audience who did see this. This one, though, is not really a kid&#039;s show. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artwork and Animation: 4<br />
<br />
The art is very 90s, and fairly low budget at that. Honestly, it&#039;s kind of ugly to watch, but I mean, what has Toei ever made that was very visually appealing in the first place? They&#039;re not exactly the paragon of animation quality. The quality drops noticeably in the last 3 episodes- even with the chibi stuff they were using to mask how rough it looked. <br />
<br />
Never fear- Yugi&#039;s physics breaking hairstyle/head parasite is always in great form, as is Jounouchi/Joey&#039;s... hair... thing. <br />
<br />
Basically, this show looks like a Phillips CD-I game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound and Voice Acting: 4<br />
<br />
No complaints about the voice acting, other than Yukana, the voice of Miho, is annoying as heck. Sorry C2- but you sound like a live hamster being put through a meat grinder combined with screeching children. <br />
<br />
Now, what IS odious about the sound is the uber-recycled generic porno style hip hop muzak that plays in the background of scene setting and as insert music. You hear that, this 80s dance synth cut, and these two &quot;spooky&quot; sounding clips that loop every 3 seconds approximately 46 times each per episode. I think including the OP and ED, there were a total of maybe 6 pieces of music used in the show. Re-re-re-re repetitive. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a shame that Dan Green never got to dub this Yugi.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
The same kids we know and love, but with the addition of Miho, and a few changes in personality: <br />
<br />
Yugi gets beat up like once every other episode, and close to the end of the series actually gets his azz beat in an arcade by a guy that knows Hokuto Shin Ken! ATATATATA and everything! He&#039;s pretty much a pathetic woobie, but he makes up for it by being caring and determined to help people, I guess? *mumbles something about Heart of the Cards*<br />
<br />
Yami Yugi on the other hand, either drives someone insane by breaking their mind with magic, sends them to the hospital due to the dangerous game they play (and lose), or just straight up kills them! He takes absolutely no crap in this series, and is keeping the mental health facilities and hospitals full of patients. <br />
<br />
Jounouchi/Joey and Honda/Tristan are basically the same in this series- ruffian goons who torture Yugi in the beginning, befriend him, and then never leave his side except to be screwups for the sake of comedy. Jounouchi does beat the snot out of quite a few people in the show though. Honda&#039;s sole character trait is that he&#039;s absolutely infatuated with the airheaded dimwit Miho, who pays him absolutely no attention.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference in character from Yugioh &#039;98 to Duel Monsters is Anzu/Tea though. In DM, she&#039;s just a useless side character who takes the role of cheerleader and annoyance, but in &#039;98, she&#039;s a legitimately likable and useful leading lady. She has a lot more self assertiveness and confidence in this series, and makes herself useful throughout. There&#039;s also a romance subplot, that, while it doesn&#039;t go much of anywhere, it still adds another facet to a character I think everyone at the least didn&#039;t care about, and at most outright hated in Duel Monsters. <br />
<br />
Lastly, there&#039;s Miho- the blue haired, flirtatious, greedy, and vapid ditz who exists solely to balance out the Dude:Chick ratio in the series and be incredibly irritating. (I&#039;m told she appears in literally one chapter in the manga, so her inclusion in the show is a mystery to everyone, including the writers.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
Where the Duel Monsters show was created basically as a gigantic advertisement for Children&#039;s Card Games™, Yugioh 1998 follows the mid-90s manga of the same name, with most of the same characters we came to know in Duel Monsters.<br />
<br />
The main difference in the show is that Yami Yugi- the ancient king of games whose soul resides in the Millennium Puzzle pendant that Yugi wears- is not only proficient at Children&#039;s Card Games™ (AKA Duel Monsters), but essentially any and all games of chance. The show is almost entirely episodic, with two arcs coming at the very end, but in each episode, Yugi manages to find himself in trouble with someone or another, and then talks them into playing a game of chance- whether it&#039;s playing cards, riddles and word games, or more often, games involving life and death. The show has quite a bit of violence, including Yami Yugi driving people insane/sending them to the hospital, and includes actual weapon wielding baddies, including guns. <br />
<br />
The second to last arc of the show even has Yugi and friends playing a game called &quot;Death T&quot;, which is just a ripoff of &quot;The Running Man&quot; game show (from the 1987 Arnie classic!) put on by Kaiba! He has them placed in a giant arena and forced to fight through different stages, including Lazer Tag with actual electricity, a riddle game where the gang nearly gets crushed by a spiked steamroller, another where blocks fall from the ceiling tetris style, and games against the Kaiba Brothers. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of setpieces and ideas used again later in Duel Monsters viewers will recognize like Kaibaland/ battle city duels and Capsule Monsters (Dungeon Dice Monsters). Many of the monsters from the other, non Duel Monsters games played in the show also make appearances later as Yugioh cards.<br />
Yami Bakura and Yami Yugi play a Dungeons and Dragons game where the gang&#039;s bodies transform into their game figures (in Duel Monsters, their favorite cards) and they have to play to keep their souls. <br />
There&#039;s also a virtual reality duel, and a mirror of Yugi and Kaiba&#039;s duel from the beginning of DM. Oh, and soul stealing. A lot of soul stealing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: 8, 6<br />
<br />
I enjoyed a lot of the dated references in Yugioh- (Tamagotchis FTW!) and general 90s-ness of the show. It was also cool to see Yami Yugi in a totally different form- making people go crazy/sending them to hell/etc and the inclusion of guns, violence, and the threat of violence, like with the bomber in the theme park who actually followed through and blew up both a building and two parts of a ride! <br />
<br />
I enjoyed watching this little departure from the Yugioh I loved as a kid. It&#039;s definitely a fun little extra for someone who doesn&#039;t want to slog through 200 something episodes of Duel Monsters, but still feel like they&#039;re going on another adventure with the gang. (GX/5Ds/Zexal don&#039;t exist. That&#039;s schlock for another day.)

    Many American Yu-Gi-Oh! fans were surprised when reading the first seven volumes of the manga, seeing how different the tone was compared to the dubbed TV series shown in the US (Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters) and how the stories that were shown in the manga weren&#039;t present in the anime. In truth, before the series that most countries outside of Asia would recognize, there was a series produced by Toei that was based on the game-centered first seven volumes of the manga. <br />
<br />
Before I go into review-mode, I&#039;d like to point out that this series IS NOT called &amp;quot;season zero&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Shadow Games/Yami no Game&amp;quot;, or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7914">
        whatever other crap people are calling it this week. This was done by a different animation company (Toei) and has nothing to do with the series most of us know in the US, aside from having the same source material (Kaiba&#039;s hair is green for heaven&#039;s sake!). Calling it the &amp;quot;Shadow Games&amp;quot; is redundant because people seem to forget that the WHOLE manga and anime series is centered around Shadow Games. &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;; And &amp;quot;more violent&amp;quot;? Um, yeah. What part of &amp;quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters was dubbed by 4Kids!&amp;quot; don&#039;t you understand?<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
<br />
In truth, I enjoyed the first seven volumes of the manga. The first anime series? Well, that&#039;s a whole different story. The anime made liberties to the story shown in the manga, most of the time for the worst. A lot of the games that were originally pure genius were altered in the anime or just removed all together. Not to mention, it was comprised of original crap made by Toei and skipped over a lot of the more interesting chapters. I wanted to see the Zombire chapters and the &amp;quot;knife in the mouth&amp;quot; game animated, darn it! They had a lot of material to work with, but Toei decided to screw it up with their oh-so-good fillers.<br />
<br />
The basis of the story and the theme is good, which is why I gave it a 6, but the anime was poorly executed, not to mention poorly paced.<br />
<br />
Art - 3<br />
<br />
The character designers and animators at Toei were smoking something unpleasant when producing this series. Green-haired Kaiba aside, the character designs for all the other characters were needlessly altered from their manga-counterparts and were drawn inconsistently throughout the series. The animation was quite inconsistent in general, and the BRIGHT color palette is a pain in the eyes.<br />
<br />
Actually, the opening and ending themes are probably the only half-decent animation work that this series has to offer.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
<br />
The best thing I thought Toei did with the anime was the soundtrack, which isn&#039;t saying much because it wasn&#039;t all that amazing. The opening theme and the ending theme were OK (I especially liked the ending theme the most), but the background music is either a hit-or-miss.<br />
<br />
The voice actors were great, but the large gap in tone between Yuugi and Dark Yuugi&#039;s voices were quite exaggerated by Megumi Ogata. Still, she made Dark Yuugi sound like a VERY clear-cut badass teenager.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
<br />
MOST of the characters retain MOST of their personalities that were shown in the manga. But seeing the alteration to Honda&#039;s fairly likable character into a pansy that got beat up in the first episode for no reason, and adding Miho into the story, all I have to say to Toei is...<br />
<br />
What the hell were you thinking?!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 5<br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t for me reading the manga first, I probably would&#039;ve enjoyed this series more. But I DEFINITELY wouldn&#039;t have seen the &amp;quot;lost potential&amp;quot; the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise had if I didn&#039;t read the first seven volumes of the manga first... The way the anime was constructed was neither &amp;quot;genius&amp;quot; nor would I see any LITTLE connection this series has to the later series. I probably wouldn&#039;t even know what the hell was going on.<br />
<br />
Overall - 5<br />
<br />
Toei turning something potentially watchable into something quite horrible? That totally never happened before.<br />
<br />
If you want a SLIGHTLY more faithful adaptation of the manga, SLIGHTLY better character designs, and SLIGHTLY better animation, watch the second series (Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, subbed). In truth, the second series isn&#039;t all that great either, but it&#039;s much better than what this series is hyped out to be in the more idiotic portion of the Yu-Gi-Oh! fandom. Personally, I recommend staying away from  the words &amp;quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;anime&amp;quot; put together, all together.

    The original Yugioh.<br />
<br />
The original stays true to its name YUGIOH= King of Games, Game King. It’s not only about duel monsters but about games. <br />
The main problem is that I didn&#039;t understand the games at all. <br />
It was basically advertisement to sell games.<br />
<br />
Each episode is basically the same. Yugi or his friends get into trouble and it&#039;s up to Yami Yugi to save the day with a shadow game, not necessarily duel monsters, there&#039;s a wide variety of games.<br />
<br />
All the characters are basically the same as YGO Duel Monsters, however Yugi is more timid, Yami is darker, there&#039;s a girl named Miho who is part

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62929">
        of the group (they decided not to include her in YGO DM), Mokuba is completely different, he&#039;s a jerk just like his brother. <br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest I think the main reason I watched and liked this anime is because I enjoyed YGO DM and I wanted to experience the original. Both the original and the remake can learn from eachother.

    Yu-Gi-Oh is yet another anime that follows the same trend of Pokemon and Digimon. A boy uses fantasy monsters to fight evil and save the world. You know, the usual stuff. Of course, this series has a lot to other for those who are interested in TV shows similar to this. <br />
<br />
PROS<br />
<br />
The art style is a bit better than other anime shows from the 90&#039;s, but you can only do so much with the visuals until the flaws are seen. I think, though, despite this, that the show should be applauded for having as good of visuals as there are. <br />
<br />
One thing I always look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75231">
        for in anime like this is the uniqueness of the Yu-Gi-Oh creatures themselves. I would say 70% of them look different from one another. Every now and then, though, you will see a Digimon who looks too similar to another Yu-Gi-Oh. Since the majority of the Yu-Gi-Oh creatures look different, I give the uniqueness of the series of monsters a pass.<br />
<br />
CONS<br />
<br />
The characters in Yu-Gi-Oh are interesting, in some ways. Unfortunately, many of the characters act like others at times, which can be very annoying. I would say that it didn&#039;t bother me as a kid because, at the time, I wasn&#039;t aware of how stories worked and whatnot. But after a re-watch, it is clear that the writing in this series is not the greatest. Don&#039;t be surprised to see villains come up, one after another, who all seem to have one goal and talk in a similar manner to the previous. With that said, this only occurs within some episodes and should not be a goal of catching when it occurs. <br />
<br />
The dialogue in the show is a bit of a mess too. It can get really annoying whenever you see a close up of a character&#039;s face and they describe what move they think will occur next. To be honest, it can be quite funny, although I know it is supposed to be taken seriously. Obvious events that the viewer knows about will be repeated over and over again. This is a problem with other shows as well, but that doesn&#039;t give Yu-Gi-Oh a pass.<br />
<br />
OVERALL<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh isn&#039;t anything special. I give it a 9, but part of my rating is due to the fact that I loved it as a kid, so obviously that&#039;s going to influence my judgment in some form or another. It&#039;s not a show you need to seek out, nor is it a show that will have any emotional impact on you (unless for nostalgic reasons). It&#039;s an okay show for new viewers and a great show for those coming back to watch it again.

    The premise of Yugioh is that a young High School boy solves an ancient Egyptian puzzle that unleashes another self within his mind. This other self challenges those who do evil to karmic games and destroys their minds when they cheat. The story is laughably bad. The games are different in virtually every episode so they constantly have to take time out of the action to explain the rules for the episode. Add that to the fact that the other Yugi frequently wins through pure BS, I mean the power of friendship, and you get a story that&#039;s so stupid and cheesy it feels like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43361">
        an old B-movie. To Yugioh&#039;s credit there are some really funny moments, although most of them are unintentionally hilarious as a result of how bad the anime is. <br />
<br />
The characters are what really hut the anime. Most of the main cast is composed of complete twits. There&#039;s ordinary Yugi who acts like a small child. Jonouchi Katsuya, who&#039;s your typical thug with a decent heart. Honda, who is very bland and never shuts up about being a beautification department member and Miho, who is useless. The only characters who are somewhat interesting are Yugi&#039;s other self, Bakura and Anzu. Since they actually get some depth. The antagonists are all pretty typical as well.<br />
<br />
The art is atrocious. Everything&#039;s done in bright neon colours that can get painful to look at sometimes. There are also a lot of art errors. This makes Hitsuji no Uta look really professional.  <br />
<br />
The voice work is actually pretty well done. Ogata Megumi, Shiozawa Kaneto and Midorikawa Hikaru are especially good. The music is also very good so sound is one thing they did right.<br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 2/10. Miho shows some homoeroticism towards Anzu, but Miho also spends a lot of time chasing guys and Anzu doesn&#039;t show a lot of interest in her so those moments don&#039;t amount to anything. <br />
<br />
My final rating for Yugioh is a 3.5/10. It&#039;s bad, but it&#039;s bad in a way that&#039;s pretty entertaining. It&#039;s sort of like Adam West&#039;s Batman. It&#039;s bad, but it&#039;s also  fun to watch. So, even though it is bad, I actually do suggest watching it, if you enjoy media that&#039;s bad in an entertaining way. In fact you should get some friends together and snark it. Just don&#039;t marathon it because the art really is so bad that it&#039;s hard on the eyes.

    Although, Yu-Gi-Oh! (1998) was never released anywhere except Japan, I consider it to be the best Yu-Gi-Oh! series, and I am a fan of all the series. There aren&#039;t any overly drawn out action sequences, lasting only 1-3 episodes at most (and only on 1 or 2 occasions). Whereas, the other series of Yu-Gi-Oh! have very drawn out fights that can become slightly boring if you are not completely enjoying the main plot itself. Plus, it gives that wonderful nostalgic feeling that 90&#039;s kids get, when watching a show from that era, even if you had never seen it until now. Not to mention, that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178818">
        this show does have more mature undertones, which acts as a good source of comedy for teenagers and young adults. Overall, it is a very good series, and if you do not want to watch Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, which has over 200 episodes, this show of 27 episodes should interest you.

    I just finished rewatching it after 2-3 years and its actually pretty solid.Changed my score from 6 to 8.<br />
<br />
As much as I enjoyed duel monsters becuase it is literally my childhood,I gotta say I liked the idea of unique games in each episode.It made the show exciting although there wasn&#039;t an actual plot.It&#039;s more like bad guy shows up Yami defeats him and gives him hell.<br />
<br />
Also it is much much darker than Duel Monsters(especially the 4kids dub version)as this season includes scenes such as Yami burning a criminal or leaving Kaiba paralysed and in a freakin comma.<br />
<br />
To end my review as for the music and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328231">

The art was the same as Duel Monsters and I can say that I enjoyed the OP song and the ED song as well

    Yugioh (also known as Yugioh Season 0) is pretty much a prequel to Yugioh Duel Monsters. It&#039;s about a shy little boy named Yugi who finds a mysterious Egyptian artifact, which is possesed by a Pharaoh spirit. He is kind of a geek and obsessed with games and toys. Eventually he and his friends will encouter many bad guys and the Pharaoh always takes over Yugi&#039;s body to challenge them to deadly games. Unlike later seasons of Yugioh (which concentrate 100% on the card game) the very first story arc has only very few card duells, but a lot of other interesting methods of battling

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187383">
        insteadt (that usually consit of asspulls though). <br />
The story is pretty basic, but I always thought that the whole Egypt thing in Yugioh is kind of unique. The atmosphere is very different from the rest of the series, probably because it&#039;s from a different animation studio than Duel Monsters, so the characters look and sound different. Also the last duel in this anime and the first episode of Duel Monsters kinda overlap, so the transition from Season 0 to DM might be awkward.<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
If you never watched Yugioh, you should start with this one and continue with Duel Monsters. If you already know Yugioh, it might be cool for you to see how the plot actually beginns or just to see Yugioh in a different style.

    Yu Gi Oh<br />
<br />
Story/<br />
    Let&#039;s clear up some confusion. This wasn&#039;t the version dubbed by 4kids that you look back on with nostalgic fondness. No, this was the anime BEFORE that. The one that was actually more concerned with adapting the manga source material than selling trading cards. <br />
This Yu-Gi-Oh anime (often called Season 0 because it starts from the beginning) followed the sweet, often bullied Yugi Muto. However, after he solved the millennium puzzle against all odds, and became possessed by a dark entity. This more serious, more confident &quot;Yami Yugi&quot; surfaced whenever normal Yugi came into contact with a cruel human

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200038">
        being. Yami Yugi would then challenge the evil person to a game. And here&#039;s the kicker: rarely did he suggest a game of cards. <br />
<br />
    Nope, I got to see a whole sundry of games. And not just any games. The games Yami preferred were enchanted shadow games in which the loser was excruciatingly punished. Pretty dark, huh? I found myself really enjoying this aspect of the show. Egypt is known for its many games and &quot;YuGiOh&quot; itself is a pun that translates as &quot;The King of Games&quot; so dealing with activities besides cards really rounds out the story and gives it a bit of spice.<br />
<br />
   As a brief warning, the story did run out of funding before reaching a satisfying end. <br />
<br />
Art/<br />
I&#039;ll try not to judge too harshly since this anime was released some time ago. The art, frankly, left much to be desired, but at the same time didn&#039;t leave me wanting to gouge my own eyeballs out. The coloring was bright and gave the whole show an extremely cartoonish feel. The style itself was simple, but was decent all the same.<br />
<br />
Sound/<br />
I don&#039;t mean to this compare too much to Yu-gi-oh: Duel Monsters, but the soundtrack in this didn&#039;t hold a candle to the epic soundtrack of the Duel Monsters localization. The opening was entirely average, a happy number that was catchy, but failed to be anything special. The music used for Yami&#039;s entrance was upbeat which hardly suited his harsh character. I may be biased in my sound ratings since the English soundtrack used for Duel Monsters was so good (4kid&#039;s one glowing achievement) but who can blame me? I was simply disappointed by this Yu-Gi-Oh&#039;s music. Deserves a 4-5 rating. Guess I&#039;ll be generous. 5 it is. <br />
<br />
Characters/<br />
The anime&#039;s main protagonists were, of course, Yugi and Yami. The other main characters were Jounouchi, Honda, and Anzu who you may know as Joey, Tristian, and Tea. There was also another character by the name of Miho who was a non-reoccurring character in the manga, but still added to the main group in the anime in an attempt to balance the male/female. The characters made for a fairly well-rounded group. With Yugi as the innocent main character, Anzu as the voice of reason and love interest, and Jounouchi and Honda as the tougher, yet comedic friends, I didn&#039;t feel like there was much missing. I even felt that Miho was unnecessary, but she didn&#039;t ruin the show for me. There were many silly moments concerning both her and Honda which got annoying but not too badly. Finally, I really enjoyed Yami&#039;s character. He was sly and harsh, but also caring and gentle when it came to his friends which was a mix of traits that made him so interesting to watch. He was a character who definitely helped hold my attention in watching this show. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/<br />
I think back very positively on this anime. It ended pre-maturely, but it had a great thing going. I could rant forever about how this anime and the original manga were completely better in terms of story than the commonly known Yu-Gi-Oh. Rather than giving up a large part of the story for toy sales, this anime stuck true to what &quot;King of Games&quot; actually means; it was original. The potential of this story was so much greater than what the franchise has become. I won&#039;t bore you with a few ranty paragraphs. Perhaps, that&#039;s a video or blog for another time.<br />
<br />
Overall/<br />
Very nice for an anime released 1998. It gets a 8/10 rating from me and we&#039;ll let it go at that.<br />
<br />

    Well what can i say about this series is that was very good.<br />
The series has little to no changes based on the manga only the inclusion of one character (Miho) besides that not many changes ocurred <br />
Is practically the Yugi Oh that we knew and loved my recomendation for people is that first read the manga after that you will notices that there isn&#039;t much of a change and wasn&#039;t boring since everything changed with each episode it wasn&#039;t like duel monsters that was duel and duel and duel and duel to the point it became boring while duel monster had better animation it wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323592">
        nearly as entertaining as this one.<br />
<br />
This series deserves a remake with the animation style shown on Dark Side of Dimensions specially with anzu since she got changed for duel monster same as Yugi grandpa

    Yu-Gi-Oh! 0 was indeed an anime that surprised me, I loved the duel monsters edition to the series, and so I thought that this original adaption might dissapoint me, guess If I was wrong. I litterately struggled to keep myself from finishing this anime in one go. I will be writing a spoilerless review.<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! 0 is the very first original anime in the following Yu-Gi-Oh! series. This anime was the first one made, however due to this anime containing several elements not to appropriate for children it was never aired outside of japan. I can also see why, many of these elements were far from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318609">
        for something you should show in a G rated series, However this is an anime you wouldn&#039;t want to miss out on.<br />
<br />
Indeed, This anime was nothing like I had expected it to be. When you see the other versions you mostly see the series as a anime mostly revolving about cardgames, however here in this version you really get to see why Yugi turns out to be the king of games in the end. That&#039;s right, in this season it isn&#039;t just the duel monsters game in which they play in this version of the series..<br />
<br />
Yugi is your average boy, In most of his life he has been struggling feeling that he isn&#039;t enough appreciated in the field of friendship. There is nothing he longs for anymore than for some true friends that he can lean on, Upon being given a uncompleted millenium puzzle and being convinced that upon finishing it he will be able to get one wish fulfilled. As he finished the puzzle after eight years of struggle he&#039;ll find his friends, However unknowingly that they were there by his side all along. However as he completed the puzzle, he seem to begin having these wierd gaps in him memory of which he can&#039;t remember anything. Follow Yugi and his friends, when they battle people who does unfair deeds. What is truly the true power of friendship?..<br />
<br />
I was also positively surprised to find that this edition to the series actually had some romance in it. However, what surprised me the most about this anime, was its OST. I loved every song in the series and I constantly wanted to listen to the songs.<br />
<br />
This is an anime you wouldn&#039;t want to miss out on, Trust me. This anime, also the darkest edition to the Yu-Gi-Oh! series, will keep you watching all the way through. You will not regret watching this anime.

    Now this is an interesting little endeavor I set upon. I originally began to watch Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters because a friend of mine directed me to a site which had download links to subbed episodes (of course, he’s not here at the moment and can’t find it again). Being the strange and organized completist I am, I noticed that the original series created by Toei Animation was only 27 episodes, so I decided to watch that first. Exactly two months to the day later, I finished it…and was left…well, just read on. Just note: I have not read the original manga that the show is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15011">
        based on, and I have limited information about it, so forgive me if I make a mistake on something.<br />
<br />
Story [4.0]<br />
Although the idea is an interesting one, I think it was poorly executed. It reminds me of a little-know Nickelodeon show called Chalk Zone. I thought it was a neat idea, but the way it was put together was just…odd. However, that is something for another day. The first few episodes I thought were neat, because the game that Yugi’s alter-ego set up for the antagonist of the particular episode were actually rather clever. However, it quickly goes downhill from there.  Most of the time, the characters are involved with typical and sometimes odd situations in school that eventually lead to the game at the end. However, the game become so quick, it’s rather hard to enjoy it. Around the middle of the series, Yugi’s friend Anzu discovers Yugi’s secret in an episode that presents a clear danger, a clever game, and more time dedicated to it. That way, it was much better to get into. Some of the challenges in between are also a bit interesting, but there are too many flat, quick ones, and others just leave your head scratching as to how the challenge could have been accomplished. Things pick up at the end, where the final battles against Kaiba and Bakura each span a number of episodes, so it does have a bit of suspense to it, even though it’s entirely predictable. In fact, the final battle against Kaiba will look very familiar if you’ve watched the newer series. Almost to the point where you’ll be utterly bored. The Bakura battle also has similarities to its counterpart, where the main characters are put into the role of combatants with both spirits battling against each other and Bakura’s pure heart being the deciding factor. So, in conclusion. Interesting idea but inconsistent with its highs and lows throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Art [4.0]<br />
Well, this is an old show, so you can’t really expect much in the art department. Nothing too dazzling, nothing too spectacular. Just your basic animation. They try to make it dark at times, but nothing ominous comes out of it. Crazy hair is included, of course.<br />
<br />
Sound [3.0]<br />
Well…the music just doesn’t work for me. Nothing catchy, nothing stand out. It’s very repetitive. The OP and ED are underwhelming. All synthesized, as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Character [4.0]<br />
Not much to say about characters, either, except the following points. The decision to make Miho a main character was a bad idea. Far too ditzy and with that whiny/cute image that I find more annoying than cute. Yet, of course, she manages to be quite useful and extremely lucky near the end. Kaiba is a good villain, but it seems like he is just too power-hungry and willing to prove his own greatness. His younger brother Mokuba probably could have had more screen, but he spends pretty much all his time gloating about how he’s going to defeat Yugi that his worries about how his brother had become ruthless in his endeavors seems so…awkward. The Egyptian guy at the very beginning (didn’t care enough to know his name) should have been used more instead of having Kaiba every three or four episodes. And Bakura appears a bit too late. It’s more like he arrives, disappears, and reappears at the very end of the series to confront the protagonists. However, I did enjoy how we got to know more about the character and how he turned from the innocent person into the possessed monster. Something that I haven’t seen in the other series. Then again, that starts pretty much after this one…ish.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah. More Miho rant. Maybe it’s just me, but how do you fall in love with a guy after only seeing him for one freakin’ second and completely changing plans because of that. I’m willing to bet that girls really aren’t that way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [3.0]<br />
If you watch the Duel Monsters part of this series, this one is going to be very much less enjoyable. For those who are new, you can probably only watch the first few and last six episodes and get pretty much the backstory that you need to take into Duel Monsters. There are few interesting moments, and those usually come at either end, with a few exceptions in the middle. Most of the time, I began to zone out, as the story was not deep enough to get me interested. No touching, emotional movements, either. Also, you may have heard people spoofing Yu-Gi-Oh!’s use of friendship as a major factor in plot advancement. While the end is interesting, the use of this friendship gets used to such a cheesy level, you may begin to appreciate those efforts from Duel Monsters. Oh, and mentioning things that happen after the next episode…not a good idea, especially if mentioned more than once on the way there.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
If you’ve begun to watch ahead of this series, don’t look back at this. You will not need it to understand everything. If you must watch it, you’re in for a long and droning saga, even though it’s only 27 episodes. In short, pass if you can and/or don’t care.

    For a while, I have been reviewing multiple Yu-Gi-Oh! Series. However, there is one show that is just a bit of an odd one out, what with it being the only one produced by Toei instead of Studio Gallop. While the show is more or less just a curiosity in Japan, in the west it’s actually achieved a bit of a cult following, being nicknamed “Season Zero” by the fanbase. However is it worth its cult following? Let’s find out.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The nickname Season Zero does make sense, as unlike the Studio Gallop series, this one is purely an adaptation of the Manga’s first seven Volumes. Overall,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303376">
        while some differences are taken, it isn’t too far off from what happened in the Manga, even if the show is somewhat censored (For instance, there’s an early episode in which a guy is forced into an illusion in which he’s being burned alive. In the manga, he really was being burnt to death)<br />
<br />
However this sets forward the show’s biggest issue, which was in turn the Manga’s biggest issue: It’s extremely formulaic. I swear most of the episodes are the same thing over and over again, and while it does diversify a bit towards the end, the damage has already been done. This is not helped by the very much hit or miss quality of these stories. In general, this is just a very uneven show.<br />
<br />
Also, unlike the Studio Gallop show, which lacked a beginning, this show it has the opposite issue as it lacks an ending. Too many plot points are left unresolved, which ultimately ends up being unfulfilling.<br />
<br />
That said, the show isn’t without merit; far from it. For starters, when a story does work, it really works. It also does a good job at building up the bigger events arguably better than the Manga. For instance, Bakura is introduced a bit earlier, which helps to foreshadow his arc, and Kaiba’s role is considerably expanded upon so as to build tension towards their final encounter. It’s all very effective and there is some well-done pay off.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As you would expect their characters are mostly stuck in their selves from the early parts of the Manga. So Yuugi is far whinier, his dark side is far more sadistic, Anzu is unsure about her feelings on Yuugi and Jonouchi is more arrogant and brutish. Speaking of Jonouchi, something minor I liked is that unlike the Studio Gallop show, they did indeed keep his abilities as a street fighter. It’s a minor thing, but I did like that.<br />
<br />
However not everyone is the same as in the manga. Honda in particular is just all sorts of wrong. In the Manga, he’s more or less just a slightly nicer Jonouchi, however here that slightly part is taken up to eleven, with him being someone obsessed with order and cleanliness (Even though he was a delinquent in the Manga, just not to the same degree as Jonouchi). Also, his one-time crush Miho is elevated to a main character, and she’s just plain annoying. I legitimately did not like her at all.<br />
<br />
The Kaiba brothers also appear, and while Mokuba is more or less the same as always, I swear Seto is even more of a dick here. Not only is his backstory never mentioned, but he’s generally far crueler to everyone around him than he originally was. Don’t get me wrong, Kaiba was no saint in the manga, but even at his absolute worse he had some lines he wouldn’t cross, which this Kaiba does not. It’s a double edged sword as this does make him more hateable, but it also makes him overall more one-note.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
This show isn’t particularly great looking. While I do like the more washed out color scheme and rounder look compared to the Studio Gallop show, I also feel that the movement is far worse. This show just screams low quality at times, which is a shame as some scenes could’ve looked a lot better. Also, for some reason Kaiba has green hair here. I don’t know why they did this given that he’s always had brown hair in the Manga, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The Soundtrack is pretty good. There are only a few tracks, but they were quite memorable and they all fit the scenes that they were in. I also love both the opening (Kawaita Sakebi) and the Ending Theme (Ashita Moshi Kimi Wa Kowaretemo). Is the Soundtrack better than that of the Studio Gallop show? No, that show had just too good a soundtrack to be beat. But still, on its own merit, the soundtrack is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Unlike most of the Studio Gallop shows, this show uses some of the biggest talents from the late 90’ for a pretty great cast. None of them are as good as their Studio Gallop counterparts (Bar Okiayu Ryotaro, who is leaps and bounds better than Kikuchi Hidehiro), but that’s mostly because I feel that they didn’t get the chance to go more in depth with their characters.<br />
<br />
But as far as starting points go, I like them. Ogata Megumi is the right mix of wimpy and creepy as Yuugi, Morikawa Toshiyuki is appropriately rash as Jonouchi, Kakazu Yumi is pretty much spot on as Anzu (I like her just as much as her Studio Gallop Seiyuu) and Midorikawa Hikaru is very much arrogant and hateable as Kaiba. And that’s not all; even some of the minor characters have recognizable voices. There’s Nogami Yukana, Touma Yumi, Neya Michiko, Horikawa Ryo, Hiyama Nobuyuki and the Late Great Shiozawa Kaneto. I think the only cast member that didn’t click with me was Kashiwara Tsutomu as Bakura. He wasn’t particularly threatening or wimpy and he just wasn’t that good. He’s no Matsumoto Rica, that’s for sure.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
The Toei Yu-Gi-Oh! series isn’t great. It’s formulaic, it lacks a proper ending, and just isn’t particularly great. But I can tell there is a lot of charm behind it, and I can see why the series ended up becoming a cult classic in the west. It does somewhat make me wish that Yu-Gi-Oh! had become a franchise about games in general rather than just Card Games, but oh well. As it is, it’s a fine enough show that I wouldn’t really rewatch, but I am glad I watched it.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 6/10

    So entertaining! Yugioh Season 0 was really entertaining! Lets get into the story, apart from the beginning episodes to form the story: the premise is just each episode Yami Yugi has to kick some poor fucker&#039;s ass (probably due to them beating up regular Yugi or Jounchi) in the Shadow Games, it&#039;s obviously the typical monster of the week format, but each episode is real entertaining, with Yami Yugi playing unique games with an opponent each episode that varies from a card game, a game of plucking roses, or even being transferred into D&amp;D, and much more. In later episodes, there&#039;s even a mini-arc called

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410929">
        &quot;Duelest Kingdom&quot; playing against Kaiba and his company, following after that is battling against Bakura which, again, is really entertaining. But, there&#039;s an unresolved plot point with an Egyptian guy that I find disappointing, but it&#039;s still fine since the rest of the season delivers. <br />
<br />
The art was mostly neon bright colors to contrast the dark tone, which I find very unique (not much to say here). The sound was alright, and the Opening and Ending themes are superb.<br />
<br />
The characters were a mixed bag, with great characters such as Yami Yugi, Anzu, Yugi&#039;s grandpa, Jounchi, Kaiba, and Bakura colliding with meh characters such as regular Yugi (who is really whiny), Honda, Miho (who was just there), and basically all of the villains who weren&#039;t the main ones. I can easily forgive the bland characters though Yugioh season 0 was mainly focused on the games and the execution to them rather then the actual story. <br />
<br />
Like I said before, I really enjoyed Yugioh season 0, it was so fun watching Yami Yugi kick some asshole&#039;s ass!<br />
<br />
Overall, I through its ups and downs, I give Yugioh season 0 a 7, simply good.

    So you think you know YuGiOh? Likely, you started out watching the YGO Duel Monsters dub on TV, then watched the Japanese version and saw how much stuff had been left out in order to make the series more kid friendly for the US. Having done that, you might think you have the whole story.<br />
<br />
What if I told you that there was another series, totally different from DM, even though it&#039;s set in Domino and has the exact same characters? You&#039;d say I&#039;m either lying or crazy! I don&#039;t blame you.<br />
<br />
However, this series does in fact exist! In 1998, two years before DM was adapted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312979">
        into an anime, the studio Toei adapted the first set of YGO manga into an anime, known simply as YuGiOh, sometimes called Season Zero or Shadow/Dark Games by avid watchers.<br />
<br />
Everyone is there: Yugi, Jounouchi, Honda, Anzu, Kaiba, etc. But they are SO DIFFERENT! Little Yugi is this wussy little kid with a high pitched voice who can&#039;t get through an episode without being beaten up. Jounouchi actually starts out as something of a bully to Yugi! Honda is a neat freak who&#039;s part of the Beautification Squad because he wasn&#039;t elected class president, and Anzu&#039;s pretty much the same!<br />
<br />
The biggest difference though is Yami Yugi. I won&#039;t spoil anything, but I will say he is totally off the chain! You mess with Yugi and friends, you incur Yami Yugi&#039;s wrath and risk your life and sanity!<br />
<br />
So if you think you know, YuGiOh, I challenge you to check this series out. Deemed too dark for younger viewers, it was never dubbed or licensed in the USA, but can be seen on YouTube and many other anime streaming sites. <br />
<br />

    *This Anime is 22 years of as of 2020, there should be no issue with spoilers due to its age alone. I do talk about the changes from the Manga and Anime that I did not agree with. I also briefly talk about the D-Tower Arch and the change I did not agree with (basically, my reasoning for the scores I gave it). Read at your risk for spoilers.*<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh!, other wised known as Season 0, is a unique product of its time.  I came across this series while surfing the young YouTube and fell in love with it&#039;s darker setting, story telling and style.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364401">
        Even though I love it, it&#039;s not perfect and has a few flaws as a series. <br />
<br />
It takes a huge departure from the original Manga (which I have read prior to the Anime and it is to be expected with any adaptation) by changing and adding to the stories and characters. Miho is in fact a added character to the group, even though had focus in a few episodes and shows she can be strong, doesn&#039;t truly add anything. Honda changed from a delinquent lacky to Jounouchi to a guy who&#039;s both obsessed with his club and Miho. Honda didn&#039;t have much of a character at first in the Manga but he came around and becomes part of the group. In the Anime, it is implied that he&#039;ll do anything to have Miho notice him. This hinders his relativity as a character and can get really annoying. <br />
<br />
Another issue is the D-Tower Arch. The part that really gets on my nerve is the Rock&#039;em Sock&#039;em Robot fight. This never happened in the Manga and is added for the changes. In the Anime, Jounouchi and Miho split off to find Gramps and Honda (Gramps in the Manga was rushed to the hospital) and find both of them in a container with water slowly filling in. Then, Fuha and Aileen return to fight them. One, Aileen has no story reason to be there since she and Kiaba parted ways after her defeat. Two, in the Manga, Mokuba goes to free Honda as a gesture of thanks due to Yugi saving him from the Punishment that Kiaba forced him threw. This change in the Anime kills the positive relationship growth between Mokuba, and his ability to grow as a character, and the friend group. This addition made no character or story sense and makes Mokuba seem just as evil as his brother who is drowned in envy and revenge, clouding any love and light in his heart - including his love for his little brother. It shows that Mokuba has changed since the last time he and Yugi faced off.<br />
<br />
What would I consider to be well done is the setting, music, and the characterization of Yami. Hands down, you watch for Yami and see what crazy game or challenge he&#039;ll face or create. The music is creepy, ominous, and can be also cheery, calming and funny. The music serves very well.<br />
<br />
The art style mimics Kazuki Takahashi&#039;s style very well and fits with the type of story its telling. It&#039;s definitely not for every one and we all know its it very strange and fun to meme once it a while. It shows more when the monsters come to life. Such wonderful designs for them and Blue-Eyes White Dragon always looks fantastic. <br />
<br />
These episodes do keep &quot;in spirit&quot; of the original Manga by having different games in each episode, though, &quot;game&quot; is used lightly since many are more like challenges than games that one can&#039;t really replicate (one gimmick of the Manga is that you can play some of the same games that the characters play, though, it&#039;s not recommended to play ones that involve tasers and knifes).<br />
<br />
If you have seen or read Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist, then go ahead and check these out! I do not recommend Season 0 as a Gateway Anime or a intro to Yu-Gi-Oh! due to its different nature to it&#039;s successors. If you are a long time Anime watcher and never heard of this and the idea of using games as a basis of battle and you&#039;re not turned off from the character designs and the 90s look, check a few episodes out.

    Watch this show only for the novelty of it being the OG series for Yugioh. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this show for someone who isn&#039;t already a fan of Yugioh Duel Monsters because in all honesty if you are looking for a great story or great characters or amazing art and sound this isn&#039;t the show for you. I would recommend this show for anyone who likes Yugioh Duel monsters to basically see it all started and the inspiration for some of the fights in duel monsters such as the first duel with kaiba to even the final arc of the show. This show is worthwhile

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248011">
        for that reason alone. I would also probably someone who likes older 90s shounen as there is a lot of comparisons to be made with the older shounen and this show with some of the battles and the tropes having the feel of older shounen.<br />
<br />
The story is mostly episodic with a villain of the week type of scenario however some of the battles take more than one episode to finish such as the last two arcs. For the most part this works in the shows favor as it allows characters to appear with there own wacky motive to then be mind crushed by yami yugi by the end of the episode in a unique take on a game (note: not just card games like in duel monsters). These games can range from Dungeons and Dragon irl to laser tag to even a couple of puzzle games. This is honestly the best part of the show, the games are very creative with a neat rule set, and the solution to these yami games are always as inventive as the games themselves so these battles are the highlight of the show and usually the episode as well. However what comes after is kinda disappointing, nothing. We usually don&#039;t get any kind of check to what happens to most of these characters after losing a yami game save for one or two people and even then it&#039;s pretty minor. I really didn&#039;t like this part of the show because it&#039;s a huge unexplored aspect of the show that could have made the whole victory feel more important or at least more helpful like one of gen characters who we actually do see after she losses still acts pretty much the same as before but this time is kinda psychologically forced (note: I don&#039;t think the show ever elaborated on the fact of it being an illusion or real, which also could have been an interesting aspect to explore) to act a certain way. The story other than that is otherwise pretty generic with a lot of elements taken from older shounen like the whole 4 heavenly deva of high school trope that we hear about but never actually seen aside from kill la kill and this show apparently. While at times people tend to say that this show is darker than Duel Monsters I have to respectfully disagree and put forth the notion that most of the time this show is even more childish than Duel Monsters in terms of well everything actually. I would rate this show a 5 in the story category but I feel the unexplored aspects of the show kinda hinder this show to be able to have this score. While it can be a slog to watch 27 episodes of the same formula of villain being a villain, yugi challenges the villain to a game, wins and mindcrush repeat but I feel the uniqueness of the games kinda help make them less of a slog to go through even though it took me more than 2 months to finish this show so....<br />
<br />
Art is single handily the worst aspect of this show. It looks bad even by standards of the time period it came out in. It looks bad even by the standard of shows made 20 years before this one and that is only a slight exaggeration. The colors used in the show quite honestly look like something I could have drawn in with crayons or something. Art design is otherwise generic and lackluster aside from the choice of coloring (such as kaibas hair) I previously mentioned. Character design is actually pretty decent and while I have not read the original manga this show is based on it looks pretty similar at a cursory glance but I could be wrong though. This is not a show you&#039;ll watch for the pretty colors ever let&#039;s just put it that way so I&#039;m under no disillusion that this show deserves anything less than a two as everything about the shows art is below average and downright dreadful.<br />
<br />
Sound is also not really that good to be very honest. The soundtrack tends to repeat the same 4 songs throughout the show and the only one I actually liked was the yami yugi theme. That song matched the overall feel the show was trying to go for and is one of those songs that will get you hyped but even then it&#039;s not really a song I&#039;ll listen on repeat like Jojo or anything like that. Rest of the songs do set the mood rather well but that probably has something to do with the fact the only 3 moods you really need to set in this show is this villain is villainous, school life and get hyped yami yugi is here. While the sound is not as bad as the art it&#039;s still pretty bad with repetition of the soundtrack which really kills the mood and one decent song that I liked.<br />
<br />
Characters are their own bag of mess. Most are relegated to the villain of the week type characters I already mentioned which basically means they are very one note and offer no reason for them being major grade A dicks all the time like for a lot of these villains I&#039;m stuck wondering how are these people having a job like the doctor in one of the episodes. Main cast isn&#039;t any better tbh for some reason there is a character that isn&#039;t in Duel Monsters except she really is less relevant to the plot than tea (or anzu if you prefer). She and Honda (Tristan) were honestly really annoying characters throughout the entire series. They were completely unlikable with Miho and her overall shallow mindset and Honda trying to get in her pants and miho completely ignoring him. This joke got old even before it happened! That&#039;s how bad it is and it&#039;s repeated throughout the entire show. Rest of the main characters tend to act as they do in Duel Monsters, with only joey getting some minor development. So overall the characters are not the best. <br />
<br />
As much as I&#039;ve been harping on the show so far I actually enjoyed it quite a lot. As I&#039;ve said previously you won&#039;t like the show if you didn&#039;t like Duel Monsters and luckily I really like Duel Monsters. It&#039;s nice to see the characters I&#039;ve enjoyed in a different light (except Honda he cucked and sucked this version) and it&#039;s nice to see a different interpretation of the yami games. The games were always a fun watch minus like one that I felt the answer came a bit too easily but other than that it&#039;s a very fun watch. While I did enjoy the show a lot I still think this is an overall bad show that failed in a lot of crucial aspects whether it be the plot, characters, art and lackluster sound that I honestly wish were done as bad as what happened.
