    This is one of the most unique anime experiences I have ever encountered. This should way of story telling should be done more often. Especially for love stories like this one. Tokyo Marble is basically a two episode ova about two I&#039;ll unlucky lovers who never seem to catch a break. One episode tells the girlfriends point of view and the other episode tells the boyfriend&#039;s point of view. But heres what makes this so great: both episodes are interchangeable. You can watch one and notice little details that the other OVA purposely leaves in or out. It&#039;s such a great mind trip because you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4257">
        actually feel like your experiencing what they&#039;re dealing with. Its almost really sad but the whole experience is just amazing that one has to watch it to truly understand how amazing just watching two episodes can be. <br />
<br />
The romance story would have been perfect in my opinion with the exception of one thing... a MINI DONKEY im not going to spoil the purpose of why its in the story but suffice to say it would have been just fine using a cat or a dog or even a friggin monkey. The story was so good that one could even overlook the &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; style of the show and how they like to draw the main characters with monkey like features (you&#039;ll see what i mean when you watch it). I may not agree with what they decided on how the characters look like, but the artwork does give out that warm love story feeling. Most of the background is lightly penciled in and touched up with light or warm colored water colors. Everything looks like where it should be (except for the donkey).<br />
<br />
I know some anime series have done this method for a couple episodes but it didn&#039;t feel the same as how Tokyo Marble executed it. I cant stress enough how great this show was... I&#039;ve watched it both episodes 3 times already. Excellent storytelling and a wonderful anime to watch with a loved one, but please lose the donkey.

    Tokyo Marble Chocolate is your basic tried and true romance story about a young couple simply trying to confess their feelings for one another. Both have had terrible pasts with relationships, and hope that their present one will bear fruit. But confessing to one another is easier said than done for these two.......<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
Wonderful!!! Everything about it was so cute and heartwarming that I can&amp;rsquo;t express enough how it touched me. It does stay true to the whole &amp;quot;romance&amp;quot; theme, all the while adding in unique twists and misunderstandings that come with it. What really stood out for me the most was the fact that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10270">
        you get to experience it from both the male and female&amp;rsquo;s view point of the story. So while you get to see what one of them was doing during that day, you then get to see it from the others point of view on the next episode, and this is important as the overall plot and misunderstands can&amp;rsquo;t be understood until you have done so. Truly you can feel the pain and the love that these two share, and can&#039;t help but be drawn in by them, as they get put in most inconvenient of situations which stall their confessions for one another. While it does keep everything realistic for the most part, it also includes this somewhat exaggerated miniature Donkey character that may seem a bit out of place with the overall concept of the otherwise down to earth storyline. (which in truth....yeah it was, and just seems down right silly. Though I won&#039;t ruin the role he plays for you) Surprisingly though it worked out great, and he only adds to the entertainment of it. Its an overall calm title (at least the parts that don&amp;rsquo;t include the Donkey) and really draws you in the moment it starts. As the character&amp;rsquo;s start talking about their pasts, and right at that point you know what to expect. Though I feel I should warn some out there, that the storyline is very discrete, so if your wanting a more gushy style of love story (the characters never even kiss) you certainly won&amp;rsquo;t find it here. My only real complaint with the story was, you never really learn just why this was called &amp;quot;Tokyo Marble Chocolate&amp;quot; until the very very end. (as in the last few seconds of episode two&#039;s credits. Which seemed kind of odd to me.<br />
<br />
There is really no offensive material in this, with the exception of one scene where the main female is dressing at the beginning. So you get to see a short view of her underwear from the back. Nothing too much, but just be aware that it&amp;rsquo;s there.<br />
<br />
Artwork: 7/10<br />
It works well enough, and I did like the soft textured art that came with it, which indeed give the characters a more lite comic book style of art. I know that&amp;rsquo;s what they were shooting for when they made this, and feel they succeed well with it. Unfortunately it also gives the picture a somewhat bland look to it, this is especially true with the backgrounds. As there are some occasions where they barley detail any of the city. Kind of hit and miss, sometimes they detail it and well other times they don&amp;rsquo;t. The characters do move fluidly enough, and expect to see quite a bit of running to take place. The artwork does work out if you can appreciate it&amp;rsquo;s direction in art, but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing really too special from a technical stand point.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack: 7/10<br />
Very very suttle, its basically different soft piano tracks that play throughout most of it. It&amp;rsquo;s good to fit the lite downtown romance beat and all, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t really find a track that stood out for me amongst the others. Though you do get a more uppity beat that plays in the end of the story ark, sung by a male vocalist. The voice acting I must was was spot on, though you only get a minimal variety of voice actors in this, most of which come from the two main leads, they both fit quite well with their personalities and I feel they really did mesh well with them. But again, quite minimal.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
They are so believable in their roles that you just can&amp;rsquo;t help but root for them the whole way through. They really give off a good appeal to the audience and never come off as exaggerated. Even the some what clumsy male never got on my nerves. Which says a lot for me, as a majority tend to do. The couple just give you that certain appeal of what it&amp;rsquo;s like when a relationship may take a 180 from where you would otherwise want it to be. Again I should mention that you sadly only get a small cast in this, and all other characters are only on screen for a minute or two.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line: 8/10<br />
I really enjoyed this title, much more than I actually thought I would. If watching a gently love anime doesn&amp;rsquo;t really sound that appealing, then you probably should just scratch Tokyo Marble Chocolate off your list. Since it stays true to the lite romance formula and may be too discrete for some. However, if your looking for one of the more memorable ones out there, then this title was made for you!

    This will be a short review; I did not want to but after watching it, I had to write one.<br />
<br />
The story was short yet each scene was impactful. Though clichéd, every misunderstanding and accident was a succinct representation of the things that can go wrong in a relationship. The delivery method of separately showing each perspective of the couple was a refreshing change compared to the traditional methods. Due to the nature of the story and its short length, it is hard to describe the characters without revealing the plot. What I can say is that they are an average couple in love under not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188856">
        so average circumstances. This however does not diminish the story but complements its slightly bizarre plot and third character. <br />
<br />
The hand-drawn watercolor art was warm and calm. The short instrumental pieces that accompanied each scene were a delight to the ears. The ending songs were bittersweet.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was great. But I gave it a 7.<br />
<br />
I wanted to give it an 8 or even a 9. But I couldn&#039;t do it. Because I didn&#039;t hear what I waited two episodes to hear. I replayed the scene(s) over and over and I strained my ears, but I just couldn&#039;t hear it. I had to imagine that it was spoken; that his mouth moved under the falling snow. But this was hardly a good replacement for the spoken phrase. And this was after it spent two episodes emphasizing its importance. And despite the pictures in the ending credits, I didn&#039;t get the closure that I sought.<br />
<br />
And this was when it hit me. By not saying it, I got to feel what she probably felt all that time; that nagging feeling, the unease and sense of loss. Thus, I learnt a valuable lesson. <br />
<br />
Then I gave it a 9.

    Spend a day or two with the weirdest creature you will see, all in the midst of your boyfriend/girlfriend problems. Anyone?<br />
<br />
Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a two-part OVA that tells the story of Chizuru and Yuudai - unlike any other. It is their love story, seen through different eyes; first from the girl, then from the guy. Still, you can watch it any way you want: the episodes are interchangeable!<br />
<br />
The two sides of this couple both got issues. Every single one of Chizuru&#039;s previous relationships were a failure, and she begins to question some of her insecurities. Yuudai is no better. Heck, one of his past

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28137">
        girlfriends had more manly guts than he will ever have. Even so, they try to be in love again, and try, and try, and try some more - all the while burdened by their past mistakes.<br />
<br />
When they both decide one day that they&#039;d individually do something that will bring a lot of changes on their lives, something enters the picture - wait, what the hell? A nappy-wearing, punk-looking, mischievous mini-donkey? Wow, then begins a touching run of love, understanding and hope.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re more of a reality-based romance fan, don&#039;t be put off by the &#039;fantasy&#039; aspect you will see in this. The only fantasy-based thing in this show is the mini-donkey, for the fact that you won&#039;t see multi-colored animals roaming around the city wearing diapers in real life.  Anyway, he/she&#039;s there for a reason; I suggest you not to look at him/her literally. I think he represents a feeling that we always seek - runs away, sometimes protective, always unpredictable, the feeling that could never hide the truth. And, yeap, it starts with the letter L.<br />
<br />
Both episodes tell the same story, from different perspectives, and people tend to pick one over the other. I am personally fond of Chizuru&#039;s part more, mainly because her ending was more well-executed: the song was awesome. With that, I can tell you that the music of this anime was good, and it worked. Yuudai&#039;s half of the OVA can stand its ground. Also, I liked the designs of the show; how the characters showed emotion, the sketchy background, bravo.<br />
<br />
About half the time you will spend watching this, you&#039;ll see them running, especially true for Yuudai. Run away from something, run towards something. Yes, they&#039;re young, and the future isn&#039;t happily custom-made for them, but they push through, in spite of uncertainty, which is more than I can say for some older people.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t be afraid to chase. After all, isn&#039;t love worth chasing for?

    &quot;Tokyo Marble Chocolate&quot; is a very heart warming story of a woman and a man who believe in their hearts that they can never keep a relationship going.<br />
Today is the day that they will confess all of their emotions to each other... But, there are a few problems. One being a miniature donkey.<br />
<br />
Based off of the eponymous manga.<br />
<br />
This story is told in a very unique and intelligent way, for the two days this film represents.<br />
Episode 1 is from the View point of the woman.<br />
Episode 2 is from the View point of the man.<br />
There are details in either that make each episode make sense, this is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review85673">
        a very well thought out script.<br />
There&#039;s quite a bit of humor in the episodes as well, it&#039;s very cute.<br />
You can watch either episode in whatever order you like, it doesn&#039;t matter. I actually think episode 2 would have been a better episode to watch first.<br />
<br />
I think the ending of the series is a bit abrupt, but that&#039;s just me.<br />
At least the credits do provide some closure (You&#039;ll see what I mean when you see it).<br />
<br />
The art style of this animation is very warm, and has a watercolor feel to it. Very reminiscent of Honey and Clover&#039;s style. I loved it, and it really helped create a great atmosphere for the show.<br />
<br />
The classical style in the music fits the emotions of the characters very well. The sound effects are very well done.<br />
The sieyuu definitely fit their parts.<br />
Overall, very satisfying.<br />
<br />
For a short series, the establishment of character was very well done.<br />
Both Yuudai and Chizuru are very similar.<br />
<br />
Chizuru has a low self esteem when it comes to relationships, and wants to break off the relationship after having a great date, because she feels like she will hurt him too the extent of it no being wroth it. Or at least that&#039;s what happened in previous relationships.<br />
<br />
Yuudai also has a low self esteem when it comes to relationships, or, you could say has a low self esteem when it comes to anything. His past relationships show him getting scared of a, semi-pig-dog (Weird I know) animal, getting threatened by some punks and getting saved by his Girlfriend, and never having the courage to say &quot;Daisuki&quot; in a reasonable amount of time.<br />
<br />
Different events that all boil down to the same conclusion.<br />
<br />
No self confidence. Will it be mended? You&#039;ll have to watch to find out.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere of the production is very kind, warm, comfortable as well as heartwarming.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
If you really enjoy Josei manga, or romance anime, you will like this production. If you enjoy love stories, you will like this. <br />
If you like anything warm, it&#039;s worth watching.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the kind of family production you could watch with anyone, your Girlfriend, your parents, your kids, except for maybe macho males, but everyone needs a bit of warmth in their heart. Especially when it&#039;s about something universal. Dating.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this production based on its great atmosphere and very unique and well thought out direction.

    Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a, totaling to fifty minutes, OVA series that tells a simple, yet sweet, story of love. Usually when a series is limited on run-time it&#039;s common to see consistent issues in pacing and proper, satisfactory closure. First seeing that Tokyo Marble Chocolate only had two normal-length episodes to it, I assumed this would end up being the case, but Production I.G. has done a great job many times in the past. Luckily, that talent translates to this small work as well.<br />
<br />
As the project was worked on by Production I.G., the studio behind Attack on Titan, it isn&#039;t a surprise to note

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166153">
        that the budget for this OVA series gave it some great visuals. The animation is good and the art style is bright and pleasant. The music is also satisfying with a classy, violin-like sound throughout, topping itself with a couple, great, vocal songs. The sound work was well done, and there was never a moment where it felt as if the atmosphere could be better presented.<br />
<br />
That leads into the direction of the series, which I found to be wonderful and the greatest source of intrigue for this series. Being the anime is limited to fifty minutes and the story of love it tells isn&#039;t too complex, the director did a fabulous job of keeping explanations to the character&#039;s pasts to a minimum by presenting who the characters are through their actions in their current, connecting situation. Each episode covers the same situation, however, each episode shifts that situation to a different perspective of the other character&#039;s mindset. The budget doesn&#039;t take advantage of that fact too much, and there never grew a feeling that the reused art was restricting the enjoyment, as there are inclusions of new angles and completely different shots of the different characters in seclusion. Towards the direction, the director did a great job on this series and made a short, two-episode OVA memorable and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The characters mainly involve the two lovers who are in a conflict of trying to understand and admit their feeling to one-another, even though they are already going out. This leads to brief conflicts and confusion that restrict them from easily clearing up one-another&#039;s thoughts. Each character has a past history of failing in relationships through fear and goofy mistakes. They treat the current romance between each-other as another likely relationship that is destined to break. The series is accompanied by a few other characters with a decent amount of screen-time, but they aren&#039;t delved into. However, they are still treated in a way that makes them memorable, at least in the time upon completing the viewing.<br />
<br />
Another character this series includes is the trope of the merchandising creature, that tends to serve as comic relief. However, in this case, it was a pleasant surprise to slowly understand that this creature actually served a direct purpose in the plot and wasn&#039;t only there as decor. The creature made its place and even made some pushes at rallying the plot forward, which could be seen as contrivances, but remembering this story is nothing too unique may lead one to be forgiving to such a thought.<br />
<br />
This short series, Tokyo Marble Chocolate, tells a simple story of love in an interesting way that is well-presented. While the plot elements are enjoyable to an extent, the bulk of interest comes from the directing and the precise amount of time placed into each scene. Even though each episode covers the same situation, the OVA is still able to make the viewer get to know each character to a satisfactory level and is able to keep the pacing, and turn of events, to a degree that will constantly keep interest. Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a nice, little series with some good staff behind it, but is still simplistic in its story and characters, which is understandable due to the time restraint it holds.

    Though i don&#039;t have any idea about this &amp;quot;Tokyo Marble Chocolate&amp;quot; except for the 2-part OVA, i really still fancied this anime. Before i just keep on criticizing a particular anime when it&#039;s art is like &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; but now, having experienced to see this great love story shoujo anime, i have realized that the art doesn&#039;t matter, this made me change a lot because starting from now, i&#039;m gonna browse on through the significance of the anime&#039;s story, not minding its art. Another thing that made me love this OVA so much is because of the song Mata Aimashou by SEAMO which is also

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3520">
        one of my important basis in watching an anime--- its THEME SONG. The song really suited the OVA. And lastly, the OVA had a really unique,cool,cute,great and nice love story. So if u haven&#039;t watched this yet because just like me maybe u try to criticize it first before watching it, well, you better change now.^_^. Thanks for reading.

    Tokyo Marble Chocolate is the kind of anime that makes me proud to be an anime fan. When shows like Queen&#039;s Blade and Ikkitousen are what the general public assumes all anime is, it&#039;s quite embarassing to say it&#039;s one of my hobbies. However, there are every so often artistically driven, well paced and just friendly and enjoyable productions that anyone can appreciate. In a weird way, TMC is what one could call a perfect mix of Disney magic storytelling and the best side of japanese &quot;anime style&quot; art.<br />
<br />
Story; 7. This is probably the weakest point, but only because I&#039;ve seen so many &quot;aww&quot; shows

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16554">
        done before. And in itself it&#039;s a difficult genre to pump originality out of. However, what I can say is that the approach this story takes is very unique, telling it from the perspective of both protagonists. The contrast is very fun to watch, and the little subtleties connecting is very heartwarming when all is said and done. Nothing new, but pretty nice and relaxing.<br />
<br />
Art; 10. This is surely a love hate relationship. Some viewers will undoubtedly find this to be ugly. However, I personally loved the simplistic style, especially the way only two or three buildings at a time were detailed. The surrounding architecture was all quick sketched and looked very cool. The characters have a Studio DEEN like lankiness to them, but look much more human. They don&#039;t all look like supermodels, which I enjoyed. The color pallet is also very painterly, which my inner artist was unable to turn a blind eye to. This is for me the series high point. <br />
<br />
Sound; 8. I am pretty indignant about my dislike of anime soundtracks, aside from literally two shows. And Tokyo Marble Chocolate barely had any music. How can you, in two episodes? However, I must say the two themes used in both halves of the story (moreso the first one) fit the show, and cheesy as they were, they got stuck in my head just because they flowed without sounding too glossy. This was actually pleasantly not annoying.<br />
<br />
Character; 8. I am pretty indecisive, so I could connect with the male protagonist pretty easily. The girl was also awkward; and that brings me to the selling point. Most Romantic series seem to ignore reality pretty well, and only in Rumbling Hearts have I seen similarly real characters. Luckily for viewers, TMC is the good side of romance, as opposed to Rumbling Hearts. The &quot;gawky awkwardness&quot; of the two characters was very cute honestly, and it really made me just feel better watching it all work out in spite of everything. This is how romance needs to be done. Oh, and this should go without saying, but Mini Donkey is THE man. Coolest animal in anime ever, hands down. He even dethroned Air&#039;s Potato for cuteness.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall; 8. Tokyo Marble Chocolate is the most artistically out of the box series I&#039;ve ever seen Production IG do, and hopefully they pick up more oddball series in the future. All in all, what is important about Tokyo Marble Chocolate is that it proves trying something overdone in a much more simplified, down to earth way, it isn&#039;t always a bad thing. Deep series are cool, but sometimes you just need to kick back and remember why it is that they say the world so full of wonder and happiness; and Tokyo Marble Chocolate is a great reminder of some of those joys.<br />
<br />

    This was a very unique anime although I did find the story a little cliché. It had the typical story of two people who were unlucky in their previous relationships before getting together, having a crazy situations that can only happen in anime (ex. getting a mini-donkey instead of a rabbit), and misunderstandings due to a lack of communication. At the same time it was something that I haven&#039;t really encountered when watching anime. It had a unique style, a strange but endearing creature, a realistic depiction of the misunderstandings that can happen in relationships, and that they realized that what they previously thought they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195493">
        wanted was not what they needed.<br />
<br />
-SPOILERS-<br />
<br />
I believe that the ending was perfect for this story. Even though Yuudai never said I love you to Chizuru, I think she realized that she didn&#039;t need to hear it. I think that she just wanted proof that he loved her. In the flashbacks of Chizuru&#039;s previous relationships it seems like the guys always gave up on her after something went wrong, but the fact that Yuudai was there in the end and that he tried so hard for her was enough. Also any guy can say I love you but Yuudai showed her that he loved her. In Yuudai&#039;s case I think that he never felt that strongly about any other girl before or loved by them and he didn&#039;t really feel accepted by them either, but once he saw that Chizuru loved him too that was all he really needed.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION &amp; MUSIC<br />
<br />
I thought that this style was very beautiful and had a soft sweet feel to it. It added to their clumsy but lovable characters and it gives them a sense of innocence. I also thought that the music matched the themes in this anime and that they were very pleasing.

    I started watching Episode 1 yesterday, after reading the reviews for it first. But now having completed this short anime series. I am surprised at how amazing it was for something this short.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
To me to storyline for this short anime was priceless. I love the idea of using realism and surrealism for this anime. That mini-donkey was a good key to add to the storyline. Watching episode 1 from the girl&#039;s point of view then episode 2 from the guy&#039;s point of view was a brillant thing to do!<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
I myself enjoyed the artwork alot, but it didn&#039;t get a 10. Since there were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16568">
        like two scenes that they showed them with really large ears. But other than that, it was a different style of anime I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
I think their voices suited the characters; the girl, the guy, and yes the mini-donkey. Can I say that I love the songs for both the episodes, especially episode one&#039;s song!<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
Watching the characters deal with their problem and showing how realistic couples do tend to act in their situation gave it a plus. I like how within a 27 minute episode the character change from beginning to end. I think alot of people who have this problem they had, should take it to heart and watch this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Simple Answer. If you are looking for an anime that shows a couple with their problem and tries to get past it, this is for you. It will make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry. Watch it, cause it&#039;s a change of anime style and has something important to bring with it when done.<br />

    It’s hard to find a good Christmas themed anime, let alone Christmas anime all together. Often, if there is something set around Christmas time, it’s is a special episode or OVA of an already established series that takes place at or around Christmas, but rarely is there something original that is focused on Christmas from the get go. So it’s refreshing to get something like Tokyo Marble Chocolate that focuses on Christmas.<br />
<br />
Based on a manga written and drawn by Fumiko Tanikawa, the anime follows two people who’ve had trouble dating in the past as their current relationship with each other strains as they try and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295733">
        figure out if the other one is their one true love. This OVA consists of 2 episodes, both involving the same events, but with each one told through the eyes of each our two main protagonists. The first episode is told from Chizuru’s perspective, someone who has been unlucky with finding a steady relationship, especially since she’s very clumsy, always tripping up no matter what. The second episode follows Yuudai, an incredibly shy guy whose shyness is always getting in the way of him actually talking to women.<br />
<br />
After what initially seems yet another failed potential relationship, with Chizuru planning to end the relationship thinking that it’s yet another relationship, and Yuudai struggling to finally overcome his shyness and finally admit his feelings to someone, the OVA follows both of them through a series of both misunderstandings and happy coincidences, as they deal with what they think was just another unlucky date. And all of this stems from a donkey with a mohawk. Yep, a donkey with a mohawk.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Marble Chocolate is adorable in a lot of ways. From it’s unique and beautiful artstyle, animation, and presentation to the characters quirky shyness and clumsiness, it’s a breath of fresh air getting something this short, simple, and sweet. And thankfully, the characters shyness or clumsiness get grating or annoying, something that could have easily ruined this OVA if it had been any longer or complicated than it was.<br />
<br />
I don’t know how much i can discuss with Tokyo Marble Chocolate’s plot since not only is it so short, and the plot in both episodes are so intertwined with each other, so you can’t really spoil one without spoiling the other one.But I can say that it’s really easy to root for out main characters to overcome the obstacles in their paths and finally get together and find their true love once and for all.<br />
<br />
Also, a neat fun fact. If anyone was confused at this OVA’s title, “Tokyo” refersto the setting and the Tokyo Tower, and “Marble Chocolate”is the name of the cafe Chizuru works on but it can also be a reference to a white chocolate, which is a traditional romantic gift from a girl to a guy in Japan.

    Tokyo Marble Chocolate, a short but interesting OVA about the views of two lovers that both encounter tragic events.<br />
<br />
I must say, I am impressed by what this short OVA had to offer. I feel that the idea of the two views of each character was such a fascinating concept, I think that there are others like this but this is the first time I&#039;ve seen it in a show. The first episode I&#039;ll admit is fine, it&#039;s decent but there was a bit of a head-scratching moment as not everything was explained from the female&#039;s point of view. But once the second episode showed the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330914">
        view of the male, everything sort of clicked with the first episode. I think that the studio did a pretty good job on these 2 episodes they have, while a part of me wishes for a more solid story, I do realize that 2 episodes are not a lot of time. So I think they made the right decision on keeping the story simple but the concept interesting. <br />
<br />
-SCORES-<br />
<br />
Characters- 7/10: The weakest part, in my opinion, but there wasn&#039;t much time for the characters to be well built enough. All we had was the back story of the two and how they absolutely sucked at romance. The male is an awkward pacifist and the female is an indecisive and overly self-conscious person. Very interesting characters I must say. As for the mini-donkey, I want to believe that it is a symbol of some sort, likely the hidden &#039;correct path&#039; chooser that was in both of them and that it helped them lead back into each other. <br />
<br />
Art- 8/10: Neat, clean and unique. Definitely is a shock to see that this was made in 2007.<br />
<br />
Writing- 8/10: Cool concept, interesting characters, and somewhat enjoyable plots. I definitely felt that this was worth an hour&#039;s watch.<br />
<br />
Sound- 9/10: Fantastic OST for this short OVA. Definitely the music to scenes just adds a whole depth to the story.<br />
<br />
Overall, a pretty good and enjoyable watch. It doesn&#039;t take up too much of your time, it&#039;s only 2 episodes long, I say take a crack at it.<br />
<br />
Strong 7 to a Light 8<br />

    The title definitely indicates the feeling that you get from watching this anime. When you read it you picture something sweet, warm and shiny. This anime makes you warm and fuzzy inside with the soothing colors and design and the &#039;lightweight&#039; story.<br />
<br />
Story : 5<br />
I&#039;m not into romance anime and girly, pink stuff. It is even worse when shy characters that cannot confess to each other are involved. This is exactly that kind of love story. A lot of misunderstandings and difficulties are present too, which made me impatient and irritated. <br />
BUT these feelings of frustration were easily and soon extinguished due to the atmosphere and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204062">
        funny moments. Viewing the same story from different prospects was interesting too.<br />
<br />
Art : 10<br />
It really took this anime to a different level. It was the main reason I decided to give this anime a shot and I wasn&#039;t disappointed. The details, character design and animation were very refreshing and sweet. It was quite original too, for example the ears stuck out (without it being ugly) and the hand movements of the male mc&#039;s friend were really vigorous and funny.<br />
<br />
Sound : 8<br />
Although I don&#039;t like that kind of music, I found myself enjoying it and it was interesting how a part of the episodes was without words, but with music playing in the backround.<br />
<br />
Character : 6<br />
Both girl and boy mcs were shy and problematic and had troubles with their relationships. I didn&#039;t quite like them as personalities, I just found them cute. I don&#039;t think being cute is enough though.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 7<br />
It was ok to pass an hour with. It was quite relaxing. I think that it will be admired mostly from the female audience, but I don&#039;t want to put labels on it. Everyone could enjoy its calming effect.

    Even if Tokyo Marble Chocolate isn’t outstanding by any measure, it was a cute little anime, regardless.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Marble Chocolate tells the story of a young couple consisting fo Yuudai and Chizuru. Both have been quite unlucky in the past when it comes to relationships. Yuudai’s negative trait is specifically being cowardly and mousy, while Chizuru is afflicted with rotten luck. Their date is suddenly halted when Yuudai gives Chizuru a present. To both of their shock, it’s a mischievous (and adorable) miniature donkey. The events surrounding this donkey brings the two lovers closer than before. Both episodes both portray the same two days, just with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295865">
        differing perspectives. The first episode is Chizuru’s perspective and the second is from Yuudai’s. Watching one won’t spoil the other, so the order you watch them doesn’t matter. If you plan on rewatching the show, it might be fun to switch up the order.<br />
<br />
First thing to note is that the art is absolutely gorgeous. It’s so short that I have no problem telling you to watch it for the art alone. The backgrounds are simple, yet elegant. They remind me of a painting. The character designs are also quite striking. Again, they’re simple, but that’s what I find so charming about them. The “dot eyes” remind me of the characters from the Mother series. It’s a small detail, but I thought it was cool that the tips of characters’ fingers turned red in the cold.<br />
<br />
The music is fine. The tracks that will most likely grab your attention are the two insert songs. Chizuru’s insert song is great for being an anime hip hop track and describing her inner turmoil perfectly. Yuudai’s is...fine, I guess. The lyrics don’t fit that well, but at least it sounds nice.<br />
<br />
The story itself is good enough. A big part of a romance is development and with just short of an hour, the anime simply doesn’t have the time to pull that off. We don’t really see why the two characters love each other. We don’t really get much chemistry between the two. <br />
<br />
Still, I can’t fault the OVA too much. With only so much time to tell a story, something had to be cut, and the story’s cute, regardless. Part of this cuteness comes from the miniature donkey, whose refreshingly non-invasive. He could have been quite obnoxious, but he’s just a cute little animal that lightens the mood. The producers really knew when to make him scarce, and I appreciate it. The characters themselves are also adorable, and I was rooting for them every step of the way.<br />
<br />
Besides the art, part of what makes this OVA so unique is its split-perspective storytelling that allows us to see the full-picture of the couple. Its interesting to see the difference in their motivations at the beginning and then seeing them come together at the end. However, in terms of character arc, the OVA was a bit lopsided. We actually see Yuudai overcome his problem and that plays a part in the climax and resolution. Chizuru doesn’t really change and as such, the resolution can feel a bit unearned on her end. It’s probably because “has rotten luck” isn’t really a character flaw, or at the very least, not one someone can actively fix.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime most likely won’t blow your socks off, but it’s heartwarming regardless. You can skip it, but I recommend it on the basis of it being adorable. It might not be the best anime you’ve ever seen, but I promise that it’ll make you smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
74/80<br />

    When I read the synopsis on the plot I thought:&quot;WTF&quot;. It sounded completely ludacris, but when I watched the show I found myself liking it. It was a short sweet love story told from both characters perspective. <br />
Story: The story centers around a couple, where both have had troubles with earlier relationships, and both are anxious, trying to make their current one work. They hit a fork in the road, but manage to work it out. But I don&#039;t like the damn donkey.<br />
Art &amp; Sound: The art wasn&#039;t the best and a lot of things lacked in detail, but perhaps that&#039;s just how they wanted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294468">
        it, to center the attention on the main characters. The sound was good, but not great. There was nothing wrong with it and I liked the voice action, but there was nothing special to stand out.<br />
Characters: As the OVA only spans over 2 episodes, which both cover the same day, you don&#039;t get the time to properly get to know the characters, but what you get is good, with them traumatized by their previous, failed relationships.<br />
Overall: I liked this OVA well enough, but I did NOT like the donkey, and I would have like for them to actually say something in the final scene, not just hug (though that work ok as well).
