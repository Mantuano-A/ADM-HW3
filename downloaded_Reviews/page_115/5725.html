    For years Japan has blessed us with many version of their &quot;Warring States Period&quot; a.k.a Sengoku Era and their historical figures, directed to specific audiences. There&#039;s Sengoku Basara for all those manly types (and some girls), Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls for those who love the harem genre and last but not least, my personal favorite, Sengoku Rance, for all those closet perverts.. Not that I am one, I just like Alicesoft&#039;s gameplay style. Keeps your hand on the mouse instead of in your pants.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around an alternate world where our main protagonist, Hideyoshino, is thrown into the &quot;seemingly&quot; Sengoku Era. But here&#039;s the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36606">
        twist. There are no guys. Yes you heard me right, nil. Oh by the way, Hideyoshino is a girl so yeah, NO GIGANTIC HAREM FOR HER! <br />
<br />
&quot;But how do there breed??&quot;<br />
-Storks and Bamboo shoots..<br />
&quot;But where does all those sandwiches go to?&quot;<br />
-They make it.... and eat it themselves.<br />
&quot;But if men aren&#039;t around, why are there still wars??&quot;<br />
-PMS<br />
&quot;Why are you so sexist?&quot;<br />
-Because my mother never hugged me..<br />
<br />
Anyways, Hideyoshi decides to help her newfound lord, Nobunaga Oda (Amazon girl version!) and Mitsuhide Akechi (Meh, who cares about her) collect all fragments of the &quot;Crimson Armor&quot; from the different warlords so that she could conquer the land. Cliche story? Yes but execution is what you least expected...<br />
<br />
Do not expect a lot of full scale army battles. Do not expect any tactical brilliance. Do not expect good set of skills and swordsmanship. Do not expcet historical accuracy, at best it&#039;s just parodies. Heck, do not even expect fanservice! There&#039;s insignificant amounts of it compared to what we&#039;ve seen in 2010. So what can you expect? A different perspective of the &quot;Sengoku Era&quot;<br />
Yep, that&#039;s about it. Oh and a talking dog. How often do you see that?<br />
<br />
All the characters are based on parodies of their historical counterparts. They possess distinctive features that are culturally famous for among those &quot;Sengoku Era&quot; fans.<br />
Hideyoshino as the main lead isn&#039;t that memorable and interesting. The enjoyment would probably be deriving from her active and carefree spirit dealing with any situation thrown at her. <br />
Nobunaga is potrayed as a brutish female with her strong sense of ideals and her lack of amazement when she first saw a cellphone. I mean, the historical Nobunga had a peculiar interest in technology. C&#039;mon, what would get her to show a little bit of enthusiasm in technology? Show her an Ipad while streaming on Youtube, playing &quot;Two Girls One Cup&quot;<br />
Yes I know what you&#039;re thinking and you&#039;re right.<br />
That isn&#039;t a cup, that&#039;s a glass.. Ok fine...<br />
Talking dog! Best character in the series! Cause he&#039;s a dog and he talks.. And he wears a cool helmet! That and he actually gets turn on by looking at  naked human girls... Sigh.. can you believe that? Getting turned on by looking at another female species... I mean, do you get turn on by looking at a female dog?<br />
<br />
So should you watch another this anime? The execution of the story is just childish and unappealing to a more intelligent audience. Humor is light and only based on the bumbling actions of our main female lead. Basically, it&#039;s one of those anime that you should not think about it too hard and just go along with the flow. It isn&#039;t that bad, once in  a while, to just watch something that doesn&#039;t require any thinking or logic or sense or male characters. Yes, I know that most of you like to portray yourself as the male lead, yes I know you do.<br />

    This anime is better than it has any right to be.<br />
Made to celebrate the tenth anniversary of a pachinko machine, Sengoku Otome is an anime whose brilliance lies in the fact that it knows it&#039;s terrible. This allows it to be silly and fun without taking itself seriously.<br />
It&#039;s very lighthearted, and has both surprisingly good writing and likeable characters.<br />
Some warnings:<br />
- This is a yuri anime, there are no men anywhere<br />
- There is some nudity, but less than you&#039;d expect.<br />
Bottom line: This is a fun show, and not to be watched with expectations of drama or action.

    There are animes that i want to hate, but ended up enjoying it. Sengoku Otome is one of them. Adapted from a Pachinko series, it&#039;s one of those animes that i thougt will definitely suck, but ended up being more enjoyable that it does. I want to hate it, but in the end i ended up liking it.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Hideyoshi, the everyday dumb girl who got transported from modern-day Tokyo to gender-reversed Sengoku-era Japan and met with Nobunaga Oda and Akechi Mitsuhide, who are now female and are ruling the warring states in a world where no men ever existed and everyone is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37449">
        a good-looking female.<br />
<br />
And Nobunaga, being the person who wants to unite the whole of Japan, wants Hideyoshi to help her find the armour that will help her and Mitsuhide unite Japan as one. And from now on, every battle occured in the Sengoku Period becomes a slice of life anime.<br />
<br />
Seriously, they take a Sengoku Period anime and turn it into a slice of life anime. Yes, that&#039;s what happens. Nobunaga, Mitsuhide, Masamune, and every other person from the Warring States period are now female characters from Hidamari Sketch, and instead of battling each other, they do things like kite flying, town building and &quot;school plays&quot;. And it&#039;s all thanks to Hideyoshi, who brought Heisei-era pacifist ideas to the Sengoku Period.<br />
<br />
Of course being the Sengoku period there are battles and fights, and yes the fight scenes are kinda cool. But they are nothing more than everyday occurences instead of major story arcs, so it&#039;s nothing big. <br />
<br />
And i liked that. It&#039;s an interesting idea, especially when you have female versions of historical figures in this. I mean the lack of battles in this was surprising, but it add a nice touch to the series by replacing it with pacifistic ideas of competition. And that&#039;s really cool, i enjoy this take on the Sengoku Period.<br />
<br />
And the characters are surprising likeable. Hideyoshi, while being an idiot actually does stuff that makes her likeable. In one episode, she helps rebuild a town that was ravaged by fire with the help of Heisei-era optimism mixing with Sengoku-era work ethics. That is pretty likeable and is a good use of Hideyoshi&#039;s character. instead of &quot;LOL look at the dumb girl from the future&quot;, the writers use her to her advantage. Whereas, you got a female Nobunaga Oda who actually resembles closely to her real-life Male counterpart, being a person who is street-smart and has a liking towards foreign culture. Other characters like Mitsuhide and Masamune are okay, but Mitsuhide can be a nuisance sometimes, and she&#039;s basically the stereotypical &quot;She Is Mine so you GTFO&quot; character who has the hots for Nobunaga (Yeah, this is pretty much Yuri territory).<br />
<br />
Fanservice-wise, it&#039;s just there. Unlike Highschool of the Dead, it doesn&#039;t try and shove their boobs and ass on your face. It just appears there. Yes, they are all wearing skimpy armour and clothing, but the director doesn&#039;t want to say &quot;HEY LOOK THEY&#039;RE ALL HOT SO GO AND FAP TO IT!!!!&quot; so in the end the fanservice is minimal unlike Freezing or HoTD. That&#039;s good, and is a refreshing change from most fanservice/female-centric action animes we&#039;ve seen lately. There is nude fanservice in the ED and several hot spring scenes but that&#039;s as far as it goes.<br />
<br />
But the use of sound and music are bland to say. Sure, the music fits with the background, but it has a &quot;meh&quot; OP and ED, and it&#039;s not memorable to say. The OP is hummable but in the end of the day you don&#039;t even care about it. the ED is pretty sentimental and has a nice acoustic riff, but it still doesn&#039;t strike me.<br />
<br />
The Art and visuals are nice for a TMS studio anime. They might not be great, but there are nice scenery moments and it does strike well with me. Character designs are really cool, especially when they&#039;re female variations of Sengoku Period historical figures. The female version of Nobunaga Oda closely resembles the Oda we see in Sengoku basara and Onimusha, but the rest of the characters look way younger than their male counterparts.<br />
<br />
The seiyuus in this do fit their characters. Hidaka Rina does a good job as Hideyoshi and Megumi Toyoguchi is awesome as Nobunaga Oda, especially with that strong female voice she has. And then you have Eri Kitamura as Mitsuhide, a very serious but clumsy character which works with her style of voice. She hasn&#039;t voiced those types of characters lately, and it&#039;s nice to see her doing a different character.<br />
<br />
In summary, Sengoku Otome is a decent, fun take on the Sengoku Period by turning a Male-centric history into a female slice-of life anime. i&#039;m serious. It&#039;s basically that. I really want to hat it and call it shit but it turns out to be an enjoyable experience. it&#039;s kinda funny, and the characters are likeable. But you&#039;ll be disappointed if you&#039;re looking for an Onimusha/Sengoku Basara-esque story in this. it&#039;s a good &quot;turn off your brain&quot; anime, and it&#039;s a great guilty pleasure in the end. I Enjoyed it.

    Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox is an anime from TMS Entertainment based on pachinko games. And to think, it hasn&#039;t been that long since I looked at Umi Monogatari, another anime based on a pachinko game. I don&#039;t get it, what is it about pachinko games that makes people think they&#039;d lend themselves to a story? But Umi Monogatari was a good series, so maybe this one will be too. Let&#039;s find out.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open up with Japan in the modern day, a middle school girl named Hide Yoshino, nicknamed Hideyoshi, stops at an old shrine to pray for success in her exams because she is doing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182171">
        very badly in school and doesn&#039;t want to attend summer classes. While there she stumbles into a strange glowing circle where a feminine form is sitting and stumbles into an alternate world set in the Sengoku period. In this world there are no men and Hideyoshi runs into a burning village where she&#039;s rescued by Mitsuhide and Nobunaga. They take her to Nobunaga&#039;s castle because Nobunaga thinks she might be helpful in acquiring the pieces of the crimson armour... somehow. Hideyoshi decides to stay and help Nobunaga because she as no idea how to get home. This leads to all kinds of shenanigans.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the problems with the story. First off, there&#039;s not much point to having Hideyoshi as a modern day girl. They use it for a few “fish out of water” jokes, but it doesn&#039;t do much. Secondly, the entire population being female is dumb. Really, it would have made more sense if they&#039;d just had it set in a world where women were the ones in power but men still existed. As it is they have to waste time with a stupid explanation for how reproduction happens and then just never bring it up again. The humour is pretty mixed too. While there are some funny moments, there are also a lot of attempts at humour that fall flat. For example, they have an ongoing joke about a talking male dog perving on the various female characters. It&#039;s not funny, it contributes nothing and it makes no sense. Why is a dog interested in human women? See, this is another reason that men should have existed. They could&#039;ve made this character an old guy. Sure, it would still be stupid and cliché but at least it would&#039;ve made sense.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, there are plenty of jokes that do work, albeit they&#039;re in the minority. I also do like the way they handle the question of leadership and what makes for a good leader. It&#039;s a nicely done little side element. The series also does manage to have some competently handled sources of tension by using actual historical events.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters are a bit mixed as well. There&#039;s some really good stuff with Nobunaga herself and some of the side characters get some good moments. Unfortunately our main focus, Hideyoshi, is an obnoxious moron who spends more time getting rescued than she spends doing anything remotely useful. Most of the side characters are pretty one note too. Which wouldn&#039;t be so much of an issue if they played less of a role, but they consistently show up for the same few jokes. For example, Kenshin and Shingen have two ongoing jokes. They have a rivalry going and they&#039;re homo-erotic about it. It&#039;s kind of funny in one episode and it is funny in another one based on the execution, but most of their appearances don&#039;t really offer anything except for a reminder that they still exist.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
There are some good aspects of the art. The backgrounds are pretty well done. The action sequences are pretty strong too. Then we&#039;ve got the character designs, which emphasise mindless fan-service above making sense. These women are supposed to be warriors but most of them leave all their vitals exposed so that they can prance about in battle bikinis. There are also some art errors. There&#039;s a scene where Masamune Date goes from not wearing her eye-patch to wearing it, to not wearing it again. Where&#039;s an editor when you need one?<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
There are some good performances in this. Kitamura Eri in particular gets to show a great deal of range and does it very well. Toyoguchi Megumi also gives a good performance as Nobunaga. Akesaka Satomi is also quite good in this. Even the actors who voice more annoying characters, like Hidaka Rina as Hideyoshi, still manage to give competent performances. There is some exaggeration to them at times, but it manages to keep them mostly toned down and more realistic. The music is also nicely done.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
We&#039;ve got the les-yay between Kenshin and Shingen. Mitsuhide is also shown as being in love with Nobunaga and there are a few cases where they use “onee-sama” in its yuri sense. There are a few disturbing scenes with Hideyoshi. Disturbing since she looks and acts significantly younger than the other girls. Furthermore, she&#039;s probably supposed to be given that she&#039;s in middle school. To be fair, there aren&#039;t many scenes like that with her and most of them are done so that they&#039;re more ambiguous but there&#039;s still enough that it gets sketchy. The ho-yay factor is going to be a 6/10.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Sengoku Otome is not a bad series. It has some funny moments and some that are pretty good. However, it also has quite a few stupid moments, the main character is annoying and the art is overly fond of fan-service. Even though it&#039;s not a bad series, it&#039;s certainly not a good one either. In the end my rating is going to be a 4/10. It&#039;s below average. If you&#039;re really interested in seeing a comedic series about important historical figures as women, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s something better out there but giving this one a try isn&#039;t a bad idea. Who knows, you might get more laughs from it than I did. Next week I&#039;ll look at Strike Witches.

    Imagine for a moment that you&#039;re a Japanese schoolgirl. And imagine that you&#039;ve just fallen into a room with a magic circle and a bright blue light. And then you wake up, and you&#039;re surrounded by people fighting with swords and lances, all of whom just happen to bear the names of the people in your history textbook on the Sengoku period. Can you guess what your first thoughts are?<br />
<br />
Well, if you guessed, &quot;I&#039;ve time-travelled!&quot; you&#039;d be way off the mark. &quot;How do I get home?&quot; is a little closer, but by no means the most prominent question for Yoshino Hide, for whom the immediately

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39639">
        important problem is that her cellphone has no reception, closely followed by the fact that she&#039;s hungry. To be sure, she may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but readers who are paying attention may already have noticed the connection of her name to Hideyoshi, the lord responsible for unifying the warring factions at the end of the Sengoku period. This gives some indication of her importance in the episodes to come.<br />
<br />
The most immediately obvious quirk of Battle Girls is that, with the exception of a talking dog (no, really), absolutely everyone in the series is female. Sacrificing the dignity of prominent historical figures by turning them into moe girls has, of course, been done before (Strike Witches and Koihime Musou as the obvious examples), but Battle Girls&#039; idea of removing men altogether adds a touch of self-mockery that makes the whole situation even more amusing.<br />
<br />
Moreover, it&#039;s actually written very well. Its style of over-the-top comedy is reminiscent of Kampfer, and is very well executed. There&#039;s a good dynamic between the three central characters, and there&#039;s a brilliantly colourful cast of side-characters. The fights are short and punchy, simultaneously displaying some nice visuals and choreography and poking fun at every other shounen fight you&#039;ve ever seen. And in general, it&#039;s very well-paced, introducing characters, conflict and plot twists in succession, and tying everything up efficiently at the end.<br />
<br />
The series&#039; main problem is its mid-section, where the pacing breaks down a bit, and it gives way to a couple of episodes which advance the plot very little, and don&#039;t add much to the characters. If you mind about animation, it&#039;s also not terribly beautiful - the series was clearly made on a budget. Whether the subtext (and at times, text-text) yuri is a good thing or a bad thing is personal preference, but there&#039;s enough of that that it could affect your experience of the series if you&#039;re completely against the idea of girls pairing up together. As far as fanservice is concerned, there are a few obvious attempts to appeal to a male audience, but nowhere near as many as, say, Koihime Musou, and it doesn&#039;t really feel unnatural or mess with the flow of the series.<br />
<br />
Battle Girls - Time Paradox won&#039;t make you think, and it won&#039;t teach you something new about life, but if you&#039;re looking for a really funny series that you can relax and enjoy, it&#039;s a pretty good bet. Best watched in company.<br />

    Alright. I discovered this show when I saw a picture of a gender-swapped nobunaga, one of the characters in the series. I would say that overall I liked it, detailed breakdown is below.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Overall half of the anime feels like it is sengoku version of .... yuyushiki. We have sengoku generals, well, &quot;girl versions&quot; of sengoku generals doing various silly things that often revolve around some sort of misunderstandign related to what hideyoshi (&quot;protagonist&quot;) said. They are mildly entertaining, but nothing special. Closer to the end, the series switch to a slightly more serious mode, but never get too dark. There&#039;s some fanservice and even a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228698">
        bit of nudity here and there, but overall it has innocent feeling to it, and if not for occasional slightly more dramatic scenes, it would perfectly pass as sengoku period version of yuyushiki. Meaning girls doing silly things, blushing, having fun, and getting in interesting situations. Interestingly the anime has almost no men in it, and it doesn&#039;t go out of its way with fanservice attempts. Meaning you won&#039;t see many situations when somebody slips/stumbles and falls in an &quot;ecchic&quot; position. Right, since it is in sengoku period, there are obviously fight scenes in it too. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Protagonist - &quot;hideyoshi&quot; is somewhat annoying &quot;clumsy ditziy but cute girl&quot; archetype. She&#039;s mostly useless for most of the series. Generals are fairly stereotypical with Nobunaga being a &quot;strong woman warrior&quot; archetype. Over time characters evolve, but some of their actions are a bit hard to be taken seriously and more look like characters are half-joking sometimes. The show looks like it wants to be serious sometimes, but only puts half-hearted effort in the attempt. So most of the time it is mildly entertaining comedy, without overly dramatic spots in it... and without incredibly hilarious spots either.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
Music seems to be decent, but it doesn&#039;t stand out for some reason.<br />
<br />
Art and visuals:<br />
Design of character costumes is interesting, but they generally have low level of detail. The art style is somewhat simplified, with lower number of lines than you&#039;d usually see. For example, if you saw the difference between &quot;You&#039;re under arrest OVA&quot; and &quot;You&#039;re under arrest TV&quot;, it is roughly the same level of difference. It is not bad, but it is just the level of detail on characters is on low side. On a few occasions closer to the end, there were few scenes when the anime OBVIOUSLY pans unamiated cells, but there were very few of those. Animation is usually okay, but it is nothing breathtaking. Interestingly backgrounds seem to be fairly detailed and of decent quality. One of the rooms had a huge tapestry/rug in background with a complex drawing on it, it looked fairly detailed to me. Fight scenes weren&#039;t breath-taking, but they were decently animated in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:<br />
It is a fairly relaxing show with yuri overtones. It is not overly ecchi and is not erotic despite having some rare occurrences of nudity. It isn&#039;t overly dramatic either, most of the time it is mildly entertaining comedy. I would say it is worth a watch if you want to chill watching somewhat that is somewhat relaxed and more on a peaceful side, without heavy drama, but with a fight scenes in it... and if you want to check out designs of girls characters.<br />
<br />
So, it is an alright show, and might be worth checking out... unless your standards are very high and you want to watch nothing less than a masterpiece. IF you were looking for an ecchi title, then &quot;kinda sorta ecchi&quot; material in this anime is nowhere near the level of, say, To Love-Ru. But if you wanted to chill for a while, This might be a right title.

<br />
Battle Girls: Time Paradox, also called Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox, is an anime based on a topic that we rarely find... history. Indeed, the entire plot is based off Japanese history during the Warring State Era. The only real noticeable difference you&#039;ll find is that your favorite long-beared old landlord geezer is replaced with well-endowed, crazy 2-D chicks swinging their bigass weapons around like a crazy yandere, who are, did I mention, big-boobed (albeit Hideyoshi, which I&#039;ll touch on later). Yeah, crazy big-boobed yanderes. Mind blowing isn&#039;t it? Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but this replacement of historical figures with big rack

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39104">
        girls doesn&#039;t make an anime necessarily good or bad; it just makes it an anime and something different from your teacher&#039;s feeble attempts at teaching you Warring State Era history by showing you a slideshow of paintings of dead people for 4 hours which he/she cleverly calls a &quot;documentary&quot;. Whether this anime is good or bad is fully up to how it organizes the effective conveyance of the 5 aspects on the right side of this screen. And before you start saying anything: Yes I have a problem with teaching history by watching a 4 hour slideshow of pictures of dead people.<br />
<br />
Story (6/10)<br />
Really nothing intriguing can be said about the story. This is the history related story of Hideyoshi, who Wikipedia tells me was a Warring States Era general under Nobunaga. Hideyoshi, needless to say, is not an old man. She&#039;s an annoying little loli girl with an uncanny motivation to do mushycrap things. Hideyoshi, upon visiting the shrine to pray for good test scores unrealistically and over-exaggeratedly  does a bunch of dumb things that just so happens to push her into someone casting a spell taking them to the Warrings States Era. *Deep breaths with facepalm. Anyways, she meets Nobunaga-dono, a tall big boobed lady with the intent to conquer the land using the Crimson Armor, a legendary, cursed, and... (you guessed it) crimson armor that apparently dons battle prowess on the maiden who wears it, enabling her to unite Japan. She vows to help Nobunaga collect the 7 pieces of the armor and along the way they meet a bunch of other busty chicks representing old geezers who Hideyoshi notice resembles her best friends in the modern day world. The most seering flaw in the story is the predictability of the ending, looking even beyond what history says. I mean cmon, it&#039;s a girl who is sent to another dimension, how do you THINK it&#039;s going to end? Watching the entire series knowing exactly how it is going to end was a bummer for me since it deprived me of the powerful effect of plot twists and suspense. Perhaps if the producers spent more time to add something more interesting than a red armor, this series would have been less of a letdown story-wise. The only capricious event was when (Spoiler, not that it matters) the pink mahou-shoujo gets the ugly red armor to amplify her mahou-shoujonness and becomes a rampaging yandere. That I didn&#039;t expect O_O. <br />
<br />
Art (8/10)<br />
Realistically speaking (ironic.. since I&#039;m grading a 2-D entity) the art was outstanding. The world of the Warring States Era is large and I would have been content watching nostalgic sunsets or magical scenes. Instead, the producers thought it would be funny to have Hideyoshi&#039;s annoying face and Mitsuhide&#039;s manly face on my screen 90% of the time. But seriously, Mitsuhide&#039;s design... do something about it... I don&#039;t like wasting time asking myself if a character is a male or a female.<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10)<br />
I never really considered sound until I was watching the Mitsuhide and Date-sensei swinging practice swords. The sound effects of the sword cutting the air seemed extremely realistic. It may seem weird but at that moment I realized that the sound of the sword traveling through the air sounded better and more accurate than most of the sound effects I hear in anime. This, paired up with a very VERY catchy OP and a reminiscent ED takes the top tier cake in terms of the sound aspect.<br />
<br />
Character (4/10)<br />
My brain kind of hurts thinking about this part. Needless to say, I disliked Hideyoshi. I feel kind of bad saying this, but I really didn&#039;t like her personality. She&#039;s directly comparable to Daphne from Scooby-Doo. Both of them worry about little things, they both get kidnapped and tied up really easily, and in both cases, people (this &quot;people&quot; being me) wonder if they&#039;re lacking half a brain or something. Hideyoshi, however, beats Daphne in annoyingness and whining. She seriously doesn&#039;t cut it with the &quot;That&#039;s so mean!!!&quot;, &quot;You can&#039;t do that!&quot;, &quot;Save her.. you can&#039;t kill her&quot;. When a series goes 13 episodes with this crap, it becomes intolerable. (On a side note: &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;. Get it? From baka test? Lol. Both are flat chest but BT Hideyoshi is so much more awesome and *hangs head in shame for saying this* cute) The next character of importance it Nobunaga-dono. I personally like seeing female characters (and people for that matter) voice their beliefs directly and work to achieve their goal, exhibiting intelligence, passion and independence. Although Nobunaga did satisfy most of these aspects... she was just... a bit creepy to me, for a lack of a better description. She looks creepy and she laughs a bit weird. I&#039;m perfectly ok with psychotic yandere loli vampire girls laughing crazily when she&#039;s about to kill you in a video game, but I&#039;m not ok with a large women laughing hysterically for no reason. Mitsuhide-skipping her. Let&#039;s just say her reasons for staying with Nobunaga makes me question her sexual alignment a little. Overall the characters were really done pretty poorly. The producers overplayed the fanservice card, and the personality of the characters suffered dramatically as a result. They exhibited poor judgment in many situations, executing retarded debacles instead of cleverly thought-out actions. But above all, watching the characters go about their intended plot niche makes you realize how shallow the characters seem. I couldn&#039;t really relate to them or their actions. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (5/10)<br />
What makes up enjoyment when I watch anime is how detailed, logical and thought-out the anime is, essentially how much effort is put into making it. I can&#039;t enjoy something unless it actually makes sense to me (and many anime have failed miserably in this aspect). Battle Girl: Time Paradox seemed to do a half-assed job when it comes to logically establishing preceding plot scenes and story conveyance. Three examples come to my mind to support this claims:<br />
First is the title. It says &quot;Time Paradox&quot; but there&#039;s really nothing paradoxical about it (Except maybe trying to have a cool sounding title that ended up contradicting the original intention). Reading the title makes me think it was an anime related in some way, shape or form to string theory analysis and/or the distortion rifts caused by traveling through time. Nothing of that caliber happened. It was just a girl who traveled through time. Some paradox... <br />
Second is the effort put into battles. I&#039;m not particularly picky about battle attacks but when all the characters only attack with ONE move in the entire series it gets on my nerves a bit. Nobunaga goes &quot;CRUEL BLADE&quot; &quot;CRUEL BLADE&quot; &quot;CRUEL BLADE&quot; over and over again. Others go &quot;Fire dragon something blah&quot;, etc etc over and over again. This distaste in creativity does hurt the overall effect of the anime. I&#039;d like my anime to be a bit more creative than watching a pokemon battle where the pokemon only has one move. &quot;Rattata used tackle&quot; &quot;Rattata used tackle&quot; &quot;Rattata used tackle&quot;....(doesn&#039;t that rat ever get tired?...)<br />
Third is Hideyoshi. She gets tied to a tree and escapes. The intelligent people out there may ask &quot;how did she escape? she isn&#039;t good at anything!&quot; The anime answers with.. &quot;She got hungry&quot;. I&#039;m not kidding. She was tied to a tree. She got hungry so her stomach contracted. And she escaped. What utter laughable bull. Perhaps it was meant for humor but then I would argue that the time for that was misplaced, as it was in the middle of a very dramatic situation. Instead of thinking up something cool like having her use her secret manicure set (I swear all girls have one of those hidden somewhere on their body) get her out (I jest. It can be cooler than this), they decided to turn Hideyoshi from a Peter Griffin to a Quagmire. Yeah... wut? <br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
Perhaps I failed to convey the complete entity of my opinion in this review because after reading back, I feel like any reader could deduce that I hated this anime more than anything else I&#039;ve watched. This is certainly not the case. Battle Girls does have many positive attributes that I neglected to mention and hopefully the intelligent people reading this review who were genuinely curious about this anime would read to this last paragraph. Why a 7/10 despite all these complaint about it? Because those complaints are simply things that could change about this. It&#039;s true that I couldn&#039;t directly relate to the character but Battle Girls: Time Paradox isn&#039;t a horrible anime. It&#039;s something that you can watch to pass time, and there&#039;s certainly rewards to be obtained from watching it; the most basic being a fundamental, albeit lacking, understand of Warring States Era. Most of the information and events in this anime are genuinely a part of Japanese history, and organizing an anime based so closely off history while making it entertaining and interesting is NOT an easy task. I understand this prospect, which is why I devoted some 3 hours of my time to write a comprehensive review on it. For an anime that I hate to the core, I wouldn&#039;t even bother wasting my time writing this. I mean, you can only say &quot;This anime sucks&quot; to a sucky anime so many times in so many ways, but you can certainly say a lot more if you were genuinely trying to constructively criticize an anime to improve it.<br />
<br />
*Reviewer&#039;s note: I feel kind of bad criticizing the characters of Battle Girls like this. They were good characters and the anime did have an effect on me (albeit minor) so I kind of regret being so harsh. Of course there&#039;s always an exception to this, and one particular exception being the completely disastrous and unrelatable characters of a certain anime abbreviated to &quot;A.H&quot;.

    Sengoku Otome is a rather entertaining show! It is not the best, but is it good enough to cure boredom!!<br />
<br />
~Story~   8/10 <br />
 The story was pretty simple and that&#039;s not bad at all. It had a pretty good pacing and it managed to complete the story between these 13 episodes. In my opinion,13 episodes were just right for this anime...uhm...I got nothing more to say about the story although I think I said too little...anyway the story was nice!<br />
<br />
~Art~   9/10 <br />
 The animation was great!It was bright, the characters and the backgrounds were well-made and the fighting scenes were great too!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review158103">
        What&#039;s wrong with me! Why can&#039;t I write more?!<br />
<br />
~Sound~   7/10 <br />
 Not a lot to be said here either. The background music and the opening and ending were nice but nothing really stood out. There was nothing that intresting about the sound...still nothing bad either!<br />
<br />
~Characters~   8/10 <br />
 First of all, ALL the characters are females! All of them (ok exept one that does not really count). Hideyoshi is a &quot;typical&quot; schoolgirl that can be really annoying sometimes, Mitsuhide is the more mature one (although she can be annoying too,for a totally diffrent reason) and Nobunaga is the best of them all! She&#039;s  likeble, strong and funny. The other characters are important too but I am not going into much detail. About the development of the characters...well...the anime tries to show you that the characters are changing as the series progresses but the truth is that only Mitsuhide does...<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment~   8/10<br />
 I liked this series mainly because I was looking for an anime with lots of girls with superpowers and such things. It was really enjoyable!<br />
<br />
~Overall~   8/10<br />
 Sengoku Otome is not a masterpiece. There is nothing that really stands out in the anime. However, it is a great way to kill your bordom. Something that I should mention is that the show contains some ecchi scenes, but personaly, even if I hate ecchi scenes in anime, I was not really annoyed, as there weren&#039;t many<br />
<br />
*Thank you a lot for reading my review ^^  Have a nice day :D *<br />

    ok this anime&#039;s scenario is a big failure, about all those history&#039;s heros being women, many changes in the past&#039;s story about japan but this was not irritating, the anime generally do not has anything irritating but it is not excellent according to me. Now the &quot;confusing&quot; thing i&#039;d say it was that the genre was not exactly specified, in some parts of the series the main genre were the samurai in an other part of the series the main genre was the action and the supernatural. In the 6-7 episodes from the begining the anime was full of comedy.... JUST PICK ONE GENRE!!!. Well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review62383">
        any way.<br />
<br />
the art was plainly good, the sound as well, but, despite the story was kinda horrible this comedy in some parts was fan, in the outcome this anime has some funny moments so i can not say that it was not enjoyable at all.<br />
<br />
Those characters were good but inspired from other animes.<br />
<br />
STORY:2<br />
ART:7<br />

OVERALL: 5.8/10 = 6/10

    I didn&#039;t really know what to think about this anime at first. I have always enjoyed stuff to do with the Sengoku Era and I had to check it out. I wasn&#039;t disappointed with the show, it was a good comedy, it&#039;s just not an absolutely amazing show.<br />
<br />
First of all, there is something about the art in this show that is either cute or weird. Most characters look nice, but in my opinion Nobunaga never fit into the art style. The music was quite nice, especially both the opening and the ending theme.<br />
<br />
The characters were all quite likable (except for a certain bow-wielder in my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171939">
        opinion). Even the obvious antagonist is quite cool. I like the way they incorporated a sort of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; and you were there with some of the characters, and each character had a distinct personality, even if Nobunaga was different that they would usually be portrayed (and one of the characters even brings this up, twice).<br />
<br />
Now for the difficult part. The story is nice. Happy-go-lucky schoolgirl who happens to have the same nickname as a famous samurai is transported back in time into an alternate universe where men don&#039;t exist (don&#039;t worry, babies are explained in no way that would disturb viewers). She slowly goes through the Sengoku era, with little changes appearing from the regular timeline.<br />
<br />
Some of the things that happen are absolutely hilarious, there are some moments where you wonder why you are watching the anime, but it is a pretty decent anime that I would recommend to anyone who likes Sengoku era stories and Slice of Life animes. My only criticisms are episode 7 (god damn Yoshimoto) and the fact that there is an unfinished feeling to the story.

    This anime is based on a pachinko game (something between a slot machine and a flipper). Said game also has a story. A Japanese schoolgirl magically transfers back in time to the period of Japan’s unification. She takes part in the war by befriending one of the major generals and goes to … find a magic armour. I guess unifying Japan with this premise is impossible without a McGuffin to help you. The catch is, everybody in this world is a skimpy clothed young girl. Not even a man in sight! In fact the only male character in the whole show is a talking dog.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321961">
        So imagine the Sengoku era, one of the bloodiest times in Japanese history, to have been turned to a magical place full of half naked lesbians looking for a magic item… and the whole thing is actually the backdrop story of a game of balls… Only thing, nobody actually has “balls” besides a talking dog… And it is not a hentai; I repeat, not a hentai.<br />
<br />
Confused? So was I for a couple of hours. Sure, anime never tried to be historical and the era was always twisted around to look as far fetched as possible. The most famous example is the anime Sengoku Basara, where all the characters are bishonens with superpowers and the whole war was nothing but a videogame with lots of macho talking and no actual field tactics. I never liked that show but it was nice brainless entertainment for most. This anime is the same but in girls-only version. Did it work equally the same? Well, for starters WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE PREMISE? Why is everybody female? Why is everybody half-naked? Oh, I am sure that in a fan pleasing way all that can be simply excused as pure guilty pleasure but in terms of internal consistency the show is simply ridiculous. Sengoku Basara could claim to be about the guys fighting while the girls are safe in the kitchen as always. That old retro title Gall Force excused nicely how there are only women because they just clone themselves. Battle Girls have no valid excuse (other than silly magic). How the heck do they breed? XD<br />
<br />
The directing is done by Okamoto Hideki, someone who has nothing but bellow average ecchi and harems in his roster. So sounds like he is right at home with this brainless fan catering title. The production values are not bad either, since most of the time you get interesting sceneries with nice colouring. But don’t get too excited since Studio TMS never produced an above average work (its best attempts were Hundred Stories, Kenichi, and D.Gray-Man). The characters are all drawn generic but chances are you will only care about how much skin they show, at which point I say it was ok and their costumes lovably kitsch in a videogame fashion. There are of course countless anachronisms in the way everything works but it’s not like the show tries to be historically accurate; so don’t mind that. Voice acting ain’t bad and in times of tension they could still sound scared and sad despite the ridiculous roles they began with.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, they all don’t have much of a presence, other than showing bare skin and lesbo tendencies but when the story wants to get darker, they do manage to feel a bit dramatic. Noting amazing, since they are all very simplistic as personalities and their development is sort of expected to be as such but definitely not cardboards. Of course, given the nature of the show to the most part they are just goofing around but let’s not get into that because it never attempted to be too serious. You basically get a plot where they meet, a sort of romantic triangle forms, and betrayal rises out of jealousy and ambition. Basic stuff but it works and the ending feels satisfactory with what the producers had to work with. I mean, just the fact they bothered to have some plot and character development in such a show sounds like a miracle.<br />
<br />
Although the anime is just silly fan service fest, it is definitely better than most similar ones thanks to developing past its initial premise and ending in a solid way. Although still immature and brainless all the way, at least it tried to be something more than just aimless softporn. It is still far from a great show and will most likely be forgotten fast, but it is definitely a show anyone can watch between better anime without feeling completely cheated afterwards.<br />
<br />
