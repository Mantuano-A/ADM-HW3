    This anime is a ecchi, action, harem and school genre, all these genres together result in an anime style that usually do not please the audience, that&#039;s the big problem here. When you first see this anime you may think &quot;Yeah, this is the kind of cliche anime that every anime season has&quot;, but in my opinion you are wrong if you thought that, personally I was wrong too, I admit, I thought it was the same cliche of always, but it ended up being an anime way more interesting.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in a fictionary world, where there are ancient weapons, named Drag-Ride that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214789">
        are ancient mechanical weapons. Five years ago, the protagonist, named Lux Arcadia, was the prince of the Empire, and he also was known as the strongest Drag-Knight, the Empire was destroyed due to a revolt, now Lux is known as the &quot;Weakest Undefeated&quot;, the Drag-Knight who doesn&#039;t attack. Due to some reasons Lux ends up entering a girl&#039;s school that raises Drag-Knights.<br />
<br />
This is the story, not bad thought, if it was a little more serious I think it could&#039;ve been an anime that would please more audience than this, one problem is how ridiculous things end up happening and how all the girls want so bad the protagonist, but if you think about it, it&#039;s very common in the harem anime genres, not saying that it explains why, I think if a harem is built in the correct way it can be good, sadly it wasn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
The art of the anime has many 3D aspects, which may be a little unpleasant for some people, some parts I think the art was very strange and bad, but nothing that displeased me so much, the art was most part of the time OK, the fighting scenes were all OK too.<br />
<br />
About the sound, I can&#039;t really say if it was good or bad, it didn&#039;t caught my attention enough to make an opinion, so I will just say it&#039;s OK too, I also liked the OP, it gets in your head, the ED was also very good, singed by the group nano.RIPE that I personally like very much.<br />
<br />
If I have to say something about the characters is that, yes they are cliche, there are all of the types of girls that almost every harem anime has, but that is almost a standard of harem animes. So I really think that the characters are not bad at all, I liked even some of the supporting characters, maybe more than some main characters, lol. They all have some interesting story about their pasts, and their personalities and ways of acting didn&#039;t displeased me at all.<br />
<br />
If I have to choose if I enjoyed it or not, I would really say I enjoyed, the beggining may not catch your attention, even I thought about dropping it in the beggining, but I don&#039;t regret not dropping it, if it gets a second season in the future I will watch, if you dropped and are reading this, I advise you to give it another chance, you may end up liking it, just like me.<br />

    I started this show back when it first started airing, because I was bored. I&#039;ve seen most of the big name harem and ecchi series, and figured &quot;I may as well try this.&quot;. Mecha isn&#039;t really my thing, but the fact that this series is a Mecha isn&#039;t even what makes it bad. There may be light spoilers in here, but honestly, this show doesn&#039;t even have much of a story to begin with, and I can only imagine one thing that could be spoiled, and it really isn&#039;t even that major.<br />
<br />
Story: 2 <br />
     This series really had no overall story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214651">
        It just had mini-arcs that comprised the whole thing, and then one antagonist that wasn&#039;t really explained well at all. The series starts off with the protagonist conveniently falling into a girl&#039;s bath. And whadaya know, it&#039;s the most important girl in the kingdom! He then has to fight her for some reason to gain entry into a girl&#039;s only school to learn how to use his mech. Lets not forget that he is the biggest badass in the kingdom, and singlehandedly overthrew a regime, literally a legend among people. For reasons unknown he has to go to school.<br />
     Naturally, their fight gets interrupted, queue the &quot;evil&quot; in the show: the Abyss. They really aren&#039;t explained very well either. In the beginning, they seem to have their own free will, since they have no tactics whatsoever, yet later on in the show they exist solely to be used by people who have certain flutes. And there are multiple flutes, which makes it quite easy for people to control them (somehow). Every time one type of enemy gets stale, they get an upgrade, From normal Abyss, to big scary Abyss, to Giant ass fortress.<br />
<br />
     Also of note, for reasons unknown, I can count on one hand the number of males who could use a &quot;Drag-Ride&quot;. Why is it only females? Why is it a female only school? How do the few guys that do know how to use a Drag-Ride learn in the first place when even Lux was given such a negative reaction upon trying to get into the only school ever talked about in the entire show?<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
     I&#039;m no art critic, but I liked the way it looked. It wasn&#039;t as good as Phantom World by any stretch, but it was fluid, and looked nice. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
     The OP is bad. Starts off like it&#039;s going to be really intense, then drops into a random electro-pop conglomeration with poorly translated english words thrown in for flavor, like &quot;fight for the sky!&quot;. ED is decent, but generic. The Sound effects however are where this show really shines. Every time a character pulls their sword out, my ears have a mini orgasm, and explosions are nice and crisp. A female voices Lux, but honestly, that didn&#039;t make the slightest difference to me. In fact, I wouldn&#039;t have even noticed if I hadn&#039;t read it in another review a while back. Other voice actors are alright, nothing stood out as exceptionally good, or exceptionally bad, so I can&#039;t complain.<br />
<br />
Character: 1<br />
     This show has the worst character cast that I have ever seen. Boring main character, generic tropes for every girl in his harem, etc. <br />
        Lux: Main character, has no backbone except to &quot;Protect his friends&quot;, never goes on the offensive. His nickname because of this is the &quot;Weakest Undefeated&quot;. Is completely clueless about how girls work, and even when he has opportunities right in front of him, he drops them. He lacks confidence in anything but his goal to protect his friends, which makes him lose so many opportunities. He could have been laid many times throughout the season, by any of the people in his harem, yet instead he gets a total of 3 kisses, which aren&#039;t dramatic at all, and very anti-climatic, since he freaks out after each one.<br />
        Airi: Lux&#039;s little sister, because what show would be complete if the main character didn&#039;t have a sister that rarely does anything except push him forward in his determination? Has barely any screen time, manages to be condescending in spite of this. <br />
        Lisesharte: The princess that he falls into the bathtub with. tsundere, quickly goes full dere in less than a full episode, and then just manages to push herself away from him due to her own stupid decisions, because you can&#039;t have a relationship in a harem.<br />
        Philphie: the kuudere childhood friend. Eyecandy is pretty much her sole purpose in the show, barely even an interest in his harem. She&#039;s too apathetic to care if Lux goes for her or anyone else.<br />
        Krulcifer: The only good character in the show. She is the only one you can&#039;t always predict, and that is the only redeeming factor characterwise. Still not enough to pull the rating upto a 2.<br />
<br />
     Those are the only characters I even know the name of. There is a great deal more of them, and none of them are really of any consequence. A brown haired chick that serves no purpose other than pushing the members of his harem closer to him. A black haired girl who is emotionless. I know I&#039;m forgetting characters, but clearly they weren&#039;t important enough to remember anyways. Most of them serve a single purpose as a plot device, and the only characters you get a backstory for are Krulcifer and Philpie. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
     This show was one of those where you watch it, in full knowledge of exactly everything that is going to happen before it actually does. It is nothing if not predictable. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
     Unless you&#039;re trying to get someone introduced to all of the common harem-genre antics, I would not recommend this show to anyone. I was quite looking forward to just getting it over with at the end. I could recommend many other shows that do harem better than this, and even Infinite:Stratos did harem better than this. It&#039;s no good as an ecchi, since the only ecchi is a bath scene at the very beginning, a 5 second scene in the second episode, one back massage with Celes and then Phi&#039;s boobs constitute the rest of the ecchi throughout the rest of the show. It&#039;s not good as an action, because there is too much drama involved with personal relationships. <br />
<br />
TL;DR Avoid this show unless you are out of any other show you could possibly think of, or if you are introducing your friends to the nuances of weak-character harems. <br />

    This is the 1st anime that a friend has shown me to watch so that I can join their conversations and not be that silent kid sitting in the corner of the table at lunch. As this was the first show I watched since Pokemon more than 5 years ago, I did not know what to expect.<br />
<br />
Now that I have watched it, I can safely say that this is extremely disappointing and bad. Not only is the story near non-existent and bad, the concept itself is terrible. Having machineries in a medieval setting is certainly unique, the 3d animation and the design of the machines

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216042">
        themselves do not fit the time period that which the story takes place in. Action scenes feel a little bit awkward given the weird blend of 3d animation on the machines in a 2d environment. It also baffles me that the entire student body in the school are all girls with the exception of the main character. <br />
<br />
The characters annoy me to no end. The main character&#039;s only traits is that he is a super kind guy who is also strong at fighting and has a dark past. He has no other personality outside of that and comes across as completely boring. His lack of backbone and naive nature also pisses me off.<br />
<br />
The other characters are terrible as well, to the point that I don&#039;t even bother to remember their names. In fact, the only memorable things about them is that they all have ridiculously hard names to pronounce. The yellow-haired girl who I assume is the heroine is a terrible character. I can&#039;t even take her seriously given how outright absurd and stupid the first encounter she has with the MC is and the only personality she has is that she obviously likes the MC for no reason other than I think is that he is a super nice guy. The only other character who I find a tad bit interesting is the blue-haired girl given her background and the couple of episodes that focused on her was a bit interesting I guess. The rest of the characters are completely forgettable and has no large impact to the show.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show is terrible, and felt like a complete waste of time. This is the opinion of someone who&#039;s experience with anime are only in Pokemon and Digimon, so my opinion might not be as important or highly regarded compared to a person who has watched more anime.<br />

    Sorry if I used wrong words or some grammar errors, that&#039;s because English isn&#039;t my primary language.<br />
<br />
Ok, here is the review :<br />
<br />
When I see this for the first time, I was thinking about Asterisk and Failed Knight because they have a similar intro, but I don&#039;t really mind it. But after completed this anime, I was very disappointed. Many things came up and make this anime more worse, fot example the last battle was good actually, but some things came and almost make me stopped watching fot a while, but I finally managed to watch it until end. <br />
<br />
For the story, it&#039;s bad. It&#039;s really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214670">
        bad. I can&#039;t tell how bad it was by word. Our mc, have a divine drag ride and supposed to be a strong character, in the last battle I think he would use all of his power, but no. His power were useless, well not completely useless but it&#039;s useless. That&#039;s same with other characters, nobody used their power to the max, that&#039;s make me it worse. Beside, the story is pretty hard to understand but I don&#039;t really paying attention into it.<br />
<br />
Intro and ending were good, the songs were nice, it also easy to remember. The voice act is awesome, I like it. The sound effect is great,  No complaint from me, but overall I don&#039;t really like it because some background songs weren&#039;t fit with the show. But that&#039;s okay, I don&#039;t mind it.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s an average show for me, because it have bad side and good side. I recommend this to you if you here only for the harem genre (it&#039;s not contain alot of ecchi). But if you looking for a good battle or something other than harem, you wouldn&#039;t be like this. The ending is a cliffhanger (this is an announcement, I won&#039;t tell you why did I wrote it) and I think it would be good if this has a second season.

    I really don&#039;t understand the appeal of this, it&#039;s good for people who&#039;ve never seen a mech/harem/action/romance/ecchi anime in their lifetime, but otherwise I can&#039;t see it. It&#039;s just a cesspool of horrible tropes mixed into a fuckfest of bad characters and predictable storylines. Anytime you feel like it might be good, it just falls flat on it&#039;s face with disappointment. <br />
<br />
The entire show is just a massive cop out. I can&#039;t find a single interesting thing in this anime that hasn&#039;t been borrowed from something else. The main character&#039;s backstory was interesting until you get ever so slightly into it and realize it&#039;s boring

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212086">
        as shit. The voice acting isn&#039;t necessarily bad, but it&#039;s nothing to write home about. The character and mech designs are pretty bad as well, they&#039;re all bland rip offs of other mediocre characters. Each one has an equally bland back story that you can immediately see in the first 3 seconds of their dialouge. For some reason, they can never have a fight without some dumbass monster interrupting and forcing them to work together, which is yet another cop out. Even the fights with the things that interrupt are cop outs.<br />
<br />
They usually happen in exactly this way: <br />
&quot;Lets fight this person and/or monster.&quot; <br />
&quot;We can&#039;t win!&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh no! I am being forced to use my super powerful mech robot!&quot; <br />
&quot;Reload on fire!&quot; <br />
 Done.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s how it works. Nothing new. Nothing interesting. Imagine everything you hated about Infinite Stratos and Sword Art Online forced into existence by some shitty writers and mediocre artists. That&#039;s all this is.<br />
<br />
(P.S In case your wondering, it&#039;s not even so bad it&#039;s good, it&#039;s in the middle area where you can see even the slightest amount of effort was put in, but just enough so that it&#039;s presentable, nothing else.)

    One of my favorite types of anime, as it has it all in from action to romance. You will fall in love with each of the characters in this anime. Story line is well written and entertaining for the same old story line in a harem anime.<br />
<br />
I would recommend it as one of those anime to watch when you have some free time.<br />
<br />
Only cons is I had to watch it in Sub and in many place the speed which they talk and Sub is too fast to read but still was most enjoyable anime to watch. <br />
<br />
All and all when I can watch a anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310276">
        like this for more than 4 hours straight with out getting bored it a good anime for me.<br />

    This season brings us another title to add to our catalogue of generic battle academy harem anime: Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle. These days it&#039;s hard for shows to be innovative so when I watch a show featuring common clichés I tend not to get too worked up about it, but this show doesn&#039;t at least attempt to try to differentiating itself and it is as generic as they come. By the first episode these things occur within JUST the first episode:<br />
☑ MC is a dense nice harem lead.<br />
☑ Protagonist is actually OP.<br />
☑ MC gets enrolled into an all-girls school.<br />
☑ Started with the MC accidentally groping or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214815">
        seeing a girl nude.<br />
☑ Female student challenges MC to a duel.<br />
☑ Every girl falls for the MC. (I&#039;m not joking with you. Every single female in the school pretty much wants this guy&#039;s D.)<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
The story can be summed up like this: <br />
Meet MC-kun. After some circumstances he ends up enrolled in an all-girls school (because why not?) and through his efforts he accidentally ends up getting an unwanted harem. The end.<br />
Many shows within the &quot;battle academy harem anime&quot; genre can for the most part be summed up like this. Obviously this is not a true summary of the story but it does fit Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle and many of its similar shows pretty well.<br />
<br />
Joking aside, here&#039;s a rough summary:<br />
The previous ruling empire of Arcadia was overthrown via a rebellion five years ago. Lux Arcadia, a former prince of said empire accidentally ends up in a female dormitory&#039;s bathing area and falls on top of the kingdom&#039;s new princess Lisesharte while she is bathing and she challenges him to a Drag-Ride duel. The results of the duel somehow ends with Lux being enrolled into this all-girls school which &quot;coincidentally&quot; is where his younger sister and childhood friend are enrolled in.<br />
<br />
If you think the story will try to explore its world more by explaining more on what the monster&#039;s known as Abyss are or what Drag-Rides are you&#039;ll be pretty disappointed. The Abyss are your generic evil monster that our main characters must destroy and the Drag-Rides simply get an explanation of: &quot;They are ancient weapons excavated from the ruins.&quot; The anime does have a plot but due to some pacing issues I can&#039;t really make much of it and with its one-dimensional villains all over the place I can&#039;t say who the actual antagonist really is.<br />
<br />
Basically what I&#039;m saying is rather than focusing on better pacing, world building, and actual good character development most episodes are like this:<br />
• Insert generic harem antics here.<br />
• Potential haremette is in trouble!<br />
• Lux defeats the one-dimensional villain and saves her.<br />
• Girl has joined the harem!<br />
• Repeat.<br />
This is the case for: Lisesharte, Krulcifer and Celistia which is more than half the harem!<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
There&#039;s not really anything noteworthy to mention, it&#039;s pretty average. A lot of CGI is being used in the fights and they look pretty good at very least. Character design wise... I don&#039;t like Philphie very much. Her hair looks weird along with her massive breasts.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
Who thought having Lux being voiced by a woman would be a good idea? He sounds much too feminine! The OP and ED are at the very least decent overall although sometimes the beginning of the OP makes me want to bang my head against my monitor.<br />
As for the soundtrack, it&#039;s nothing special. It fits the mood of the show and all but I can&#039;t see myself praising anything about it at all although it would be nice for more variety considering every fight in the show seems to use the same exact track every time.<br />
<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
Here&#039;s the characters so far:<br />
• Harem lead former prince: Lux.<br />
• Tsundere princess: Lisesharte.<br />
• Deadpan childhood friend: Philphie.<br />
• Flirty foreign student: Krulcifer.<br />
• The proud man-hater: Celistia.<br />
• The brocon little sister: Airi.<br />
• Yandere assassin: Yoruka.<br />
<br />
I honestly don&#039;t give a damn about any of these characters.<br />
• Lux is your standard harem lead who is blessed with an OP Drag-Ride.<br />
• Lisesharte, because her tragic backstory arrives and is somewhat resolved too quickly that I couldn&#039;t feel bad for her. Then she falls for Lux and spends most of her screentime playing the clingy jealous girl.<br />
• Philphie is your standard childhood friend who ends up being there just for the fanservice.<br />
• The little sister because she spends her screentime doing nearly nothing.<br />
• The rest of the girls for falling in love with Lux after goes all OP on the shows one-dimensional villains.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
&quot;So bad it&#039;s good.&quot; That&#039;s pretty much the best way to describe this. That, or I may be a masochist. The characters annoy me, the fanservice turns me off and overall the story bores me for being predictable and horribly cliché. The fights end up as how you&#039;d expect; the MC shows up to save a member of his harem, turns the tables on his opponent and then absolutely wrecks them. Most of the fights are very anti-climatic because once Lux shows you up can expect the fight to end up pretty damn quickly (I&#039;m still salty about the episode 12&#039;s final battle).<br />
<br />
To elaborate more on the fanservice there&#039;s a particular scene near the end of the second episode where during a fight they elaborate more on Lisesharte&#039;s backstory where they show her in a particular position while I guy rips off the lower part of her uniform. Uh? Another fanservice scene that I did not enjoy was when some of the characters invited Lux into a room where they dressed up as maids for him.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle is your standard generic battle academy harem anime that uses concepts and ideas from other battle-harem shows without bringing in any fresh new ideas leaving it as an utterly forgettable anime. It&#039;s like watching a mix of Infinite Stratos and Asterisk War.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: It&#039;s a massive cliché storm. Please, just go watch something better.

    Fans of the typical action-based harem show rejoice, here is yet another entry that follows the script to the letter. See princess naked in first episode? Check. Have princess challenge and lose a duel to the protagonist? Check. Have princess give up on retribution afterwards and pledge fealty to the protagonist? Check? All in the two episodes? Check.<br />
<br />
Bahamut is a mech-based, semi-fantasy action-based harem that follows closely in the footsteps of shows such as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. The twist this time is that our protagonist is the disgraced prince of the former empire that was overthrown after oppressing its people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230218">
        too far. To somehow atone for his family&#039;s past, Lux works as a handyman in the new empire, helping in whatever capacity others need. However, after the events in the first episode, he becomes the only male student in an otherwise female-only academy, and becomes one of the knights defending the school and empire. What enemies lurk in the distance beyond the empire, and what dangers lurk within the multitude of bijins in the school?<br />
<br />
[b]Animation:[/b]<br />
Bahamut is a well drawn show with a bright, relatively saturated color palette and a serene setting with a nice albeit blurry mountainous backdrop. There&#039;s a nifty blend in the setting between rustic buildings and scenery and ultra-modern technology such as the sword-mechs and holographic ear-pieces. Unfortunately, there is a ton of CGI usage with the mechs here and though it&#039;s relatively good quality, it&#039;s still distracting at times. The mechs themselves aren&#039;t anything that great, their appearance is probably most similar to those seen in Infinite Stratos. The generic mechs used by non-important characters look like they took their color scheme right off of the training mechs of Aldnoah Zero. Character styling is pretty good with a diverse looking cast and a good variety of clothing. There are occasionally some drawing inconsistencies (random clothing articles changing color within a scene) but overall things check out well here. If I were to find fault in something, the overly-obvious, crazed antagonist look makes things too, well, obvious.<br />
<br />
This show has a fair amount of action with a lot of mech battles and a slight amount of blood. Antagonists take the form of either other mech pilots or occasionally weird dragon-like ancient creatures known as Abyss. Our protagonist wields two swords, which can each transform into a piloted mech. One is a wyvern, an average sacrificial mech. The other is Bahamut, which is essentially a Strike Freedom in Gundam terms. The first time our protagonist uses Bahamut can be likened to the first time Goku goes Super Saiyan, the entire world stops to marvel at what has happened; humorously future summonings have no such effect. Unfortunately, Bahamut is so strong (and fast) that its special ability allows the animator to literally carve out a path of destruction on the screen. If you&#039;re looking for outstanding choreography, unfortunately this isn&#039;t where you&#039;ll find it.<br />
This is indeed an ecchi based harem, the protagonist pretty much sees all the heroines at least partially undressed (except his sister thank goodness) and has more than his share of accidental exposures. Granted, some of the heroines are very aggressive relationship-wise (such as Krulcifer) so expect them to make moves on our poor (or lucky?) protagonist.<br />
<br />
[b]Sound:[/b]<br />
The show opens with a few nice guitar notes but then dives into a melody that that isn&#039;t particularly inspiring; it&#039;s electronic but not in the right way. The ED carries a similar guitar-based feel with Nano.Ripe&#039;s instantly recognizable voice. It&#039;s not a particularly memorable song but a fitting cool down piece. The brass instrumentation of the BGM during the title intro and various other portions of the show definitely give the show a fantasy-like feel. The overall BGM is minimalistic most of the time, and the  instrumentation changes based on the scene. There&#039;s a nice memorable, string-based theme whenever our show gets to a battle climax.<br />
<br />
With the exception of Lux obviously being voiced by a girl, I think Bahamut&#039;s cast is actually very good. This is the first major role for Lynn that I&#039;ve seen, and she does a pretty convincing tsundere as Lisesharte. I really liked Ari Ozawa&#039;s voice as Kirin in Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and her &quot;nii-san&quot; callings are pretty effective here too. Though her character isn&#039;t my favorite, Risa Taneda does a great job here as well. And not to be outdone, Shizuka Ishigami has an extremely dangerous/flirtatious character and she totally nails it. Again, if I were to have to pick a negative, it would be the antagonists; the VAs do a perfect job of matching a crazy-sounding voice to the already crazed-antagonist look.<br />
<br />
[b]Story:[/b]<br />
Lux is a Drag-Knight (short for Dragon-Knight, though I don&#039;t think Japan gets the connotation of their shortened form), which means he can make his sword magically turn into an armored mech, which he can pilot. However, he is not just any knight but the infamous pilot of Bahamut, the pitch-black machine dragon responsible for single-handedly bringing down the former empire (his father&#039;s empire essentially). It&#039;s an interesting twist to the setting that honestly isn&#039;t fully explained in the show.<br />
<br />
The show follows Lux as he assists the all girls&#039; school with various tasks, often involving saving various girls in succession who become smitten afterwards. The central plotline is actually rather weak, as the episodes tend to do a round robin through all the heroines. Once all the heroines are &quot;conquered&quot;, we find that there is yet another tournament! This brings the show to an over-the-top climax followed by an all-too-familiar conclusion.<br />
<br />
Honestly, despite following the plotline of virtually every other action-based harem in the past few years, this is a story well executed. The story flows well and successfully weaves just the right amount of character development and interaction into the main plot. There&#039;s just the right amount of action mixed with a dose of comedy, ecchi, and romance.<br />
<br />
[b]Character:[/b]<br />
There are quite a few characters in Bahamut, and not all of them are treated equally. Some of the girls are successfully differentiated enough (such as Lisesharte and Krulcifer) but others still end up feeling like cookie-cutter characters (such as Celistia and pretty much all the antagonists). Airi is a nice accompaniment to Lux though one may wonder why she&#039;s just treated as an encyclopedia and fact announcer; perhaps they just wanted to be completely sure not to annoy viewers with an incest route. I guess I&#039;m just happy that the show didn&#039;t turn into another Aokana as both Krulcifer and Kirihime are quite bold.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few supporting characters, many of whom don&#039;t contribute all that much to the story; I will say Noct is a fun character as &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; are like half her lines. Despite these, there is a fair amount of character interaction and relationship development. Yes, a lot of it is just Lisesharte looking jealous as Lux hangs out with the other gals, but it&#039;s in a reasonable quantity. If there&#039;s one downer, it&#039;s that the characters are pretty static overall, I can&#039;t say that the events of the show strongly changed any of the characters (just having feelings for the protagonist doesn&#039;t count).<br />
<br />
[b]Value:[/b]<br />
Bahamut should be the go-to action-based harem of the season. It&#039;s an entertaining, easy to watch show with a good mix of themes and a fluid execution. It&#039;s obviously not perfect as described above but overall it tells a nice story with reasonable depth and memorable characters. There are plenty of unanswered questions at the end of the show so I&#039;d expect there to be a sequel as well. Compared to other shows of the genre, I think it compares about equally with its predecessors such as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry but with a much more moderate dosage of ecchi (especially when compared against Testament). Looking for a decent harem with some action? You&#039;ve found it.<br />

    Story: so basically the story is about this guy was chasing a cat or somthing like that he crashes throught the ceiling and than sees a girl naked she challenges him 2 a duel (wont spoil the rest of how it starts)<br />
<br />
Art: pretty good art nothing really else to say<br />
<br />
Sound: again was pretty good<br />
<br />
Characters: now the characters were damn good too me NO ONE annoyed me or anything just good characters <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: i did this anime like a month or 2 months ago but from what i remember the anime was freaking funny also the ecchi is really there and add a harem too it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review226346">
        which i loved just a very good anime<br />
<br />
Overall: this is a anime id so recommend for a lot of reason the characters, the ecchi, and also the great comedy and harem to it aswell

    An anime with much more potential, but not enough episodes...<br />
<br />
Story: 7 <br />
The story is actually really strong!!! You can make a really big succesful anime serie with a pretty large amount of episodes (30-40). What did they do? They put it all in 12 episodes, which is a real shame. It could have been way more extensive than it is now. <br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
Good art!! Well done!!! Characters and environment looked really good. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9 <br />
The effects of the shooting were pretty cool, never heard them before lol.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
For the characters goes the same. They could have been worked out much better! They have such interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233448">
        past and stories I want to know more!!! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6 + 1 = 7<br />
I did actually enjoy the series, but on the other hand i didn&#039;t because it was going too fast and undetailed for me. That made it around a 6 to me, but it did have a little bit of fanservice, some romance and dunny moments sow i give it a bonuspoint :P.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7

    At first, I had the impression that this anime was shit but i had to finish it. It did start off a bit bad but when the story goes a bit farther it can actually give u a nice impression. The reviews i&#039;ve seen here are mostly the ones who didn&#039;t even try to finish it. This anime actually points out the action more often and has less of the Harem while the anime being ecchi, it was merely just a few scenes.<br />
<br />
I find the other characters annoying honestly like there are those girls who try to hard to get attention from a guy which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217584">
        basically describes the princess (I&#039;m not good at remembering names) while she also acts too innocent around him. The main character is like not that typical boy in an Ecchi/Harem Anime who easily gets a nosebleed or like blushes.<br />
<br />
This also has some sense of humor to it which i think is great. So overall, i&#039;d give it a 7 since there are those scenes which are irrelevant to the story.

    Well I went with an overall of 7/10 or &quot;Good&quot; for this anime but the scale could have easily fallen to the 6/10 or &quot;fair&quot; side, I &#039;m the kinda person that depends on first impressions and chooses a book because I love the cover. <br />
<br />
This anime has got some awesome art and that&#039;s about all that I found to be great about the anime, I&#039;m Not trying to randomly hate, I am just pretty sure that this anime could have been a lot better than what it is.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna try and keep this as short as possible making sure you under stand exactly why

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214819">
        i think this anime deserves being in between &quot;good&quot; and just &quot;fair&quot;.<br />
<br />
story <br />
<br />
Well, the plot is their but the story doesn&#039;t do a good job in showing you the details, even half way through the anime, understanding what exactly the enemy wants or or why their doing what they do is impossible to figure out.<br />
<br />
A few flashbacks here and their, most of the time they are very vague and dont cover much of the real stuff you want to know about the direction of the anime, I think the protagonist is supposed to be a sort of tragic hero but how that am not sure exactly how such responsibility fell onto him and not his brother.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
<br />
Like i said in the intro, the best part about this anime for me was the art, the smooth anime, well drawn characters and super vivid colors that are gonna melt your eyes.<br />
<br />
some of the female characters have unrealistically gigantic boobs. so it for someone who like that kinda thing, then this is your anime but I can&#039;t really call this is fan service.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
<br />
Well, for starters, the main character is not the kinda protagonist everybody is gonna love, He&#039;s back story wont exactly make you understand him and that goes for most of the characters in this anime.<br />
<br />
Their are parts where its clear that your supposed to sympathize with the characters but because of how much the anime is gonna give you, getting the viewer emotional is just impossible.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
Not gonna say much because its very rare for anime to mess up this part, you wont be disappointed, Oh! wait the soundtrack, this might be just more of a matter of preference but I absolutely did not like the soundtracks.<br />
<br />
I like it when the music helps me get the mood of the scene, the soundtracks used in this anime didn&#039;t make it for me.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
Just like the overall score, Am giving it a &quot;bare pass&quot; 7/10, the anime could have been better but I cant say that it wasn&#039;t fun to watch , their are some awesome fight scenes and a few characters in here that might catch your attention and I think that how anime should be.<br />
<br />
The anime is not a must watch, but also its not a not watch, in my point of view its just another anime with a lot of cliche characters and that in it self is not a bad thing, so If you haven&#039;t started watching it then I think you better stop reading the reviews and just watch it.<br />

    HELLO GENERIC SUPERNATURAL MAIN PROTAGONIST WHO&#039;S OP GOING TO AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL 98#. <br />
<br />
So think Infinite Stratos only better as there are ACTUAL threats in this one! Although there are some typical cliches from this kind of series, there are some difference that makes this anime slightly tolerable. For instance how about the main haremettes are developed enough they get their own episodic arcs with villains and threats that leads into a bigger bad connected to Lux?, good animated battles with mech suits vs. mech suits AS WELL as mutant dragons and finally a decent bigger bad main villain throughout the anime planning behind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review214650">
        the curtains of the anime (though he&#039;s terribly &quot;evil for evil sake&quot; cliched).<br />
<br />
LA won&#039;t lie, when LA first saw this anime&#039;s first episode, LA saw it as typical genericism with the elements LA mocked at the start of this review however as LA carried on watching it, it did get slightly better with the harem growth (along with the main protagonist at that) and plot wise. <br />
<br />
LA&#039;s favourite character throughout the anime was Krulcifer Einfolk voiced by &#039;&#039;Yukiyo Fujii&#039;&#039; and once her arc started LA at least got excited and was satisfied with her arc (and not to mention that arc didn&#039;t fall under the typical cliches). This anime does follow multiple plotlines from the harem antics aka. haremette arcs, the political dealings between it&#039;s two warring countries and the threat of dragons attacking and they do balance it in some modest way, LA won&#039;t say they balance all these perfectly but still, it&#039;s enough so that those plotlines doesn&#039;t intervene and distract with one another and more blend together to make a more cohesive narrative.<br />
<br />
Yes unfortunately the fanservice is there and it is somewhat annoying especially the haremette and childhood friend of Lux, Philphie Aingram voiced by &#039;&#039;Yuriko Kubo&#039;&#039; but other than that, it&#039;s &quot;modest&quot; in terms of fanservice levels. <br />
<br />
The animation by Lerche, is decent enough with slick character designs to even the mech suits looking pretty distinct from each of the main cast members, the battle scenes are animated decently enough for LA to get invested in, though this anime&#039;s battle scenes has a habit to blatantly change into segmented CGI just on the characters face along with both CGI animation and traditional animation on the mech&#039;s thus is blatant enough to get slightly distracting.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, as much as LA&#039;s favourite character was Krulcifer Einfolk and &#039;&#039;Yukiyo Fujii&#039;&#039; still did a fantastic job for what material she had, LA&#039;s favourite voice actor on the other hand goes to &#039;&#039;Shizuka Ishigami&#039;&#039; as our wild-card harem member who voiced Yoruka Kirihime and her character starts to appear in Episode 11!...yeah Shizuka Ishigami&#039;s voice work actually gave LA enough of an impression of Yoruka for TWO EPISODES and was satisfied by even that.<br />
<br />
 The ending did once again didn&#039;t fall under certain tropes of this anime genre, because of that LA will praise it at least that the battle harem members DO get something to do for this final battle and not just have Lux one-hit kill everything, however as much as LA praise this ending, it still falls under some battle harem tropes at the same time but LA won&#039;t explain as it goes into spoiler territory but LA just wished the final scenes of this anime didn&#039;t end so cliched as it had something good going but then threw that intense, plot-driven and character-invested ending away by the last second. <br />
<br />
Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle for LA, it is your typical anime you&#039;ve seen in coming out recently, the &quot;GENERIC SUPERNATURAL MAIN PROTAGONIST WHO&#039;S OP GOING TO AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL&quot; LA mockingly said at the start of this review, however LA will say that as cliche as it is, it does handle some of it&#039;s plot and character elements better than it&#039;s anime cliched genre counterparts, such as a haremette-centred focus that simultaneously develops both the haremette in question as well as the main protagonist, good animated battles as well as major villain that actually means and changes something to the plot and characters.<br />
<br />
At best LA will say that Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut is competent and modest but that&#039;s the best praise LA will give it, it still has some flaws and cliches hanging here and there to bring back it&#039;s typical genericism to it&#039;s anime genre from the beginning to later on the very last seconds of the anime. Want a better version of Infinite Stratos with actual risks and stakes instead of the plot or characters just loafing around, then come mech-suit up with Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut!...but even then it&#039;s not &quot;much&quot; of a step up. But still a step up is better than any steps down right?

    Continuing I finish those last 11 episodes of the winter season: Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut. <br />
<br />
Story: I won&#039;t hate it completely because it was a few months between me watching episode 1 and 2. I had no clue what was going on. I had no clue what the bad guy was trying to do. Kill Lux? Destroy the world? Take over the country? I&#039;ve never read the LNs but apparently a lot of content was skipped. The story was poorly explained.<br />
<br />
Character: This show is a harem so 95% of the characters will be female. I hate none of them. In fact they are all wonderful.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218603">
        <br />
Stereotypical god MC who every girl loves: Lux<br />
Tsundere: Liseharte<br />
Childhood friend: Philphie<br />
Best girl: Krulcifer<br />
Large breasts and second best girl: Celestia <br />
Ass and only 3 episodes: Yoruka<br />
Sister: Airi<br />
And because it&#039;s a girls only school: Attractive Girls<br />
They are generic but so wonderful at the same time. The only problem is the show is 12 episodes long and the main girl, Liseharte, barely gets screentime. <br />
<br />
Art and Sound: At first the I didn&#039;t enjoy the OP but it did grow on me over time. The ED is so happy. It&#039;s really upbeat. Soundtrack not really worth noting other than one song. <br />
Voice acting was good. <br />
The CGI for the Drag-Rides appeared good. I don&#039;t watch much shows with CGI so I can&#039;t really judge. It didn&#039;t appear out of place. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Yes. I did enjoy this. You don&#039;t need to think super hard to watch it. Not every show needs to be an Evangelion. I enjoy ecchi and I enjoy harems so I will enjoy this show. If you enjoy those watch this. If you don&#039;t avoid it. <br />
<br />
Overall: Saijaku is not terrible nor is it the best thing to air in the winter. If you don&#039;t enjoy harems just avoid it.

    Avoid this one. Nothing about Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut provides the series with any sort of staying power.<br />
<br />
Uncompelling characters combined with a lackluster plot provide the viewer with nothing but disappointment. <br />
<br />
Even the harem portions of the show were incredibly uninteresting. This can probably be attritubed mostly to bad writing. What wasn&#039;t ruined by the atrocious writing was ruined by the uninteresting supporting cast. The bevy of female supporting characters in this show were a massive collection of annoyances.  The only slightly redeeming aspect of this show are the average, at best animations. Even this was nothing particularly special however. <br />
<br />
In no way am

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222366">
        I a super picky viewer who will drop something if it doesn&#039;t blow me away. I do, however, expect a certain baseline to be met. If a show is going to delve into the oft-explored depths of the harem-action-fantasy-school genre, it needs to be able to compete with it&#039;s plethora of competitors. This, unfortunately, usually appears in the form of fan service, but occasionally appears in the form of intriguing plot. Saijaku Mutai no Bahamut, unfortunately, largely fails in both regards. <br />
<br />
I personally found the &quot;development&quot; of the main character to be particularly disappointing. I believe this stemmed from the show&#039;s crisis of feeling. It was too busy trying to be a light hearted harem anime, and the potential for the main characters dark past being brought to light, and his ultimate redemtion being achieved, was completely squandered. So much wasted potential from this show&#039;s plot completely saddened me.  <br />
<br />
Ultimately, viewers usually judge the watchability of a show by it&#039;s enjoyment. This is usually hard to quantify, and is largely affected by an individuals personal preference as opposed to anything concrete. I suppose you could call this the eye test. This show completely fails in this regard, and is very lackluster.<br />
<br />
Do yourselves a favor and skip this show.

    The first couple episodes were interesting, even if a bit cliche, however my interest dropped off around the middle where the dialogue felt boring, the action was a bit dull and the plot didn&#039;t feel like it was moving. The anime did pick up again in the last few episodes, but the plot development felt rushed while eariler episodes had little to no story.<br />
<br />
The story was lacking and often hard to follow with little explanation on some of the core features in the setting. The animation style and design was decent with nothing to hate, but its also nothing special. The OP and ED were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review320119">
        also decent, but not really memorable or catchy, and the sound effects and voice actors were good. The characters are generally all cliche harem/ecchi tropes, easily predictable and nothing impressive, however, there were 2 characters which I found good.<br />
<br />
Overall, the anime is a 6/10 for me, it had some enjoyable moments but there are other similar animes that do a better job such as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry or Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.

    I originally watched this anime back in 2018, 2 years after its release, when I didn&#039;t know what else to watch, and I was satisfied. I rewatched it recently, and I thought to share my thoughts on this anime.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
6/10 Fair<br />
The story is okay, I suppose. Its nothing special, but it was enough to hook me into watching it. There were parts in the story where I thought it was too predictable, and too cliché, but its nothing too major. Also at times I felt a bit bored until something interesting happened.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
6/10 Fair<br />
Its okay. Nothing eye catching, but not bad either. Compared to other anime around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317381">
        2016, its fine, and still upholds today, besides some meh cg moments.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
7/10 Good<br />
Its good, decent sound effects and such. Voice acting is good. And I really liked the opening and credit songs. <br />
<br />
Character<br />
7/10 Good<br />
The protagonist was good. Had a okay backstory, okay goal, and decent character development. Any other characters of the main cast also got okay character development with decent screen time. The only other character who didn&#039;t really get the same treatment was Yoruka, who is introduced in the final act of the first season. She was interesting, and I really wish she got more screen time.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
6/10 Fair<br />
For the most part, I think I enjoyed this anime for what it was besides some minor nitpicks.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
6/10 Fair<br />
Overall, I was satisfied, and wouldn&#039;t mind watching a second season, though its highly unlikely, mostly due to the unsuccess of this anime business wise, and its not really popular, and its been around 4 years since the first season released. Would I recommend this anime ? Yes, I would. Its okay, though nothing special. My overall score for this anime is 6.25  <br />

    In a yet another generic fantasy settings in yet another light-novel anime, which starts exactly in same way as those other anime series (Asterisks, Rakudai) you might watched recently, follow destiny of a tragic hero, exactly like in those other anime series you probably watched not so recently (Mahouka, SAO). His mother died, his puppy died too ... I guess ... and what is the worst he must constantly defend himself from all the girls who want him, while protecting them from one-dimensional villains. Ride the Drag-Ride which is basically fancy version of the cargo loader from the aliens. Be amazed as our Drag-Knight hero

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224145">
        overpowers his adversaries with the two most powerful weapons known to mankind ... plot armor and asspulls. Then meet his harem as he is accepted into all-girl school, like the guy in other anime (Shomin sample) I watched recently. Starring: the prince on his white mecha, the tsundere, the big beewbs, the &quot;little sister&quot;, the tragic orphan girl.<br />

    [No Spoilers!]<br />
<br />
So, I just finished this anime. Like most I believe I&#039;d say this anime isn&#039;t terrible, but it isn&#039;t amazing. The art is definitely great and the fights are definitely flashy and well done, but my biggest complaint is the extremely lack of information provided for so many questions left unanswered and when I say so many... I many like there&#039;s just a huge pit of &quot;Who? What? When? Where? and Why?&quot; In this anime.<br />
<br />
At first it&#039;ll give you a taste of what is going on, but by the middle you really just don&#039;t get what&#039;s going on, and at the end you just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215125">
        want someone to explain it to you...<br />
<br />
I really like mech animes and I really think this anime could have had so much more to it. When I finished the last episode I couldn&#039;t decide if it was worth it or not.<br />
<br />
But you might be wondering why I gave it a 6 with all this looming over my head... well it&#039;s because I may give the 2nd season a chance, mostly because I want answers to all the unknown in this anime.<br />
<br />
Should you give it a try? I&#039;m not sure... I&#039;d say leave this one for a day you REALLY have nothing better to watch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!
