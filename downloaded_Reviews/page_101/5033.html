    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
In the case of the spoilers, I will be vague to try not to completely ruin all the surprises for someone who does choose to watch this series. That said, a lot of the big events of the story really have to be brought up at least in some form to explain why its so bad. <br />
<br />
I imagine, especially for people who have not watched the series the whole way through, a 1/10 grade might come across as kind of extreme for this series. Technically speaking, it does have a functional and even expansive plotline, a good amount of buildup especially early

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244007">
        on, and a lot of actually kind of interesting character premises. The problem here is that this is a series where the appeal of the early parts is the mysteries and concepts that get established, that you look forward to being resolved later. The early parts of Arc-V, if there was proper payoff, would really not be all that bad, its just the series takes a downright insulting approach to playing off said buildup. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I thought the series was building up to something cool, only for the result to just come out as something completely pathetic and anti-climactic.<br />
<br />
Before we get into the plot, I figure I will throw a mention to the visuals of the series because it really needs to be said, they&#039;re bad. The very conspicuous looking CG appearance of most significant monsters in the series is pretty awkward, and the visual design of most cards really leaves a lot to be desired. Many characters just have monsters where their designs all just feel like chrome machine-like things, and get very repetitive in their designs very fast. They also just turn into horrible clusters of many colors and sticking out pieces that really just gets kind of ugly and unpleasant to look at. The designs that aren&#039;t this are usually very cutesy cartoon stuff which is fairly subjective in terms of appeal, but personally I found it pretty awful. The animation quality is occasionally decent, but there are frequently episodes where you can tell the bare minimum budget or effort was put forth to make it look good. Also, while this could be argued to be a problem with most modern Yu-gi-oh series, the amount of times the summon animations and chants of major monsters get repeated gets pretty aggravating, especially when due to the designs and mediocre CG they&#039;re usually not even cool the first time. I won&#039;t deny there are a few exceptions, Fluffals and Predator Plants coming to mind as monsters with actual cool concepts behind them. The problem is that they get fairly little screen time when compared to the massively played up four main dragons, which are some of the worse of the ugly machine-like designs I&#039;ve mentioned earlier and they only get worse with their evolved forms.<br />
<br />
The plot starts off by promising something an interdimensional war between different factions that use different methods of monster summoning. This is a fairly interesting basis, but we don&#039;t actually see the dimensions clash very much in battle, the most we see being that one dimension got defeated handily by another in a bunch of flashbacks. Aside from that, its basically just the main characters running around and solving other problem in whatever dimension they&#039;re currently in and not really addressing any sort of invasion or clash between forces. There are bits where it does happen, mostly in the early arcs, but its surprising and honestly kind of depressing how inactive the main antagonists of the series are for the majority of it. After some initial duels they do basically nothing other than send out fodder troops that don&#039;t accomplish anything until we meet their higher ups. The higher ups are universally pathetic and get easily trounced by the protagonist, and somehow end up buying into his stupid &quot;entertainment&quot; philosophy the show forces down our throats as hard as it possibly can. The most actually effective and fun villain is someone who is only very technically related to them, and while he serves as a decent overarching villain for his arc he is defeated in surprisingly casual fashion and then never mentioned again.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a bit more I could talk about with the plot, but before that something needs to be said about the characters. The show actually does not have a bad base for a lot of its characters, giving them fairly distinct personalities that from the one note they start from could be turned into something good. However, the show throws an obscene number of characters at the viewer, and frankly does a horrible job at managing them properly. The main character Yuya gets a ton of focus, and Yuzu, the lead girl, gets a lot up until she suddenly becomes a plot device who is never allowed to duel for the last 60 episodes. Other than that due to sheer number nobody really gets the development they need to evolve past their singular note, outside of arguably Shun who gets a respectable amount of character development. Even with him however, his growth as a character feels kind of rushed and the end of the series decides to treat him like absolute dirt, so if you bothered to get attached to the one character the show makes any attempt to make you care about other than its lead I promise you that you will be disappointed by the result.Arguably the most insulting examples are the comedic relief rival character, who based on him finally settling on a singular deck choice and starting to meld in with the protagonists, you would really think would be given a chance to show what he&#039;s worth. No, he literally never wins a duel on his own in the entire series, and the duels he wins on a team are against literal faceless fodder troops of the different dimensional factions. And the sad thing is if anything, I think he actually gets off better than a good number of characters because he&#039;s not hit by random brainwashing to love Yuya&#039;s stupid entertainment/smile philosophy. <br />
<br />
The real cream of the crap here though is Yuya himself, who on some level I get the idea behind. The whole concept was to have him be a very goofy character who had a rather childish philosophy of just thinking he could resolve things by making his monsters do silly things and make his dueling fun to watch. He did have a serious side in relation to his missing dad and you know, there was a point in the series it looks like its going to work out. At one point he duels a force of security guards and they&#039;re completely baffled by his fun and smiles solves everything philosophy, and they even take advantage of it when fighting him. As the series goes on, you would really think that they would force him to evolve past that and develop new ways of getting to people. No, instead the series gradually reconstructs said philosophy as apparently being not completely insane by having it literally solve the conflicts of entire factions on its own simply by Yuya having a &quot;fun&quot; duel in front of everyone. Its absolutely mind boggling how these conflicts which people that involved imprisonment and likely in at least a few cases death even if the show is too childish to show it are just resolved by some kid trying to be entertaining in front of a crowd. Frankly, he&#039;s not even entertaining and most of his better duels are carried entirely by his opponents, but no matter what everyone who duels him eventually comes to worship the ground Yuya walks on. As a result he never develops as a character, and is basically the same person in the final episode as he was in the first, just with a more broken deck.<br />
<br />
The thing with Yuya is the plot does try to do some interesting things with him beyond just his personality and &quot;fun and smiles&quot; brainwashing nonsense. There&#039;s the whole mystery of why there are four people with the same face, him being one of them, with chromatic robots that look kinda like dragons that the show says are dragons which react strangely and violently around each other. There are also four girls with the same face, with Yuzu being one of them, who are generally close to their counterpart Yuya equivalents. This is arguably the big mystery of the plot, and it has to be said, when its finally revealed the payoff looks kind of promising for a moment. Except the payoff takes absolutely no chance to use any of the qualities of each individual Yuya clone and instead we get a duel that goes on for a solid five episodes. Said five episodes are mind-numbingly repetitive, dull, and feel surprisingly lacking in climactic tension despite being something that recieved an obscene amount of buildup. The way it is finally resolved is absolutely pathetic and beyond anti-climactic, and  the whole time despite a situation that really would not warrant it every single character is basically worshiping Yuya for the entire fight. It even all centers around a monster who has one of the worst designs of any in the entire show, an absolute mess that shows all the low points of Yu-gi-oh&#039;s recent design direction. The whole thing is your big payoff for a show made entirely around buildup, and honestly comes across as downright insulting. Oh yeah and for the record, the way Yuzu and her clones are used comes across as insanely insulting to those characters.<br />
<br />
The show actually does not end there, and goes on for another 8 solid episodes. In those 8 episodes, Yuya duels in every single one of them with pretty much the entire universe worshiping him the whole time. Said duels are terrible and the story around them is also terrible, with the exception of one that is entirely decent because it gave screentime to a character that was sorely underused. The final one in particular is possibly the worst written duel in terms of actual &quot;action&quot; in the entire franchise, with absolutely miserable writing around it that makes Yuya and all other versions of him into considerably worse characters. The reason for all of this is something I really cannot avoid saying outright, because it is that stupid: These 8 episodes are entirely dedicated to preventing a calamity from happening again by making a baby smile. Its as bad as it sounds.<br />
<br />
There are plenty more things that could be said about Arc-V, but at its core its a series all about buildup to a grand climax where the payoff to said buildup is about as bad as it ever possibly could be. The journey there is full of characters who could have become something getting their potential squandered and then proceeding to worship the ground Yuya walks on. Yuya&#039;s childish and completely unbelievable philosophy becomes the center of the show and works miracles it has absolutely no right too, and comes across as a massive insult to the viewer&#039;s intelligence. It is not totally impossible to like Arc-V if you ignore the final stretch of 13 episodes and try to just think on how it was to watch it as it came out, but actually putting the plot together, it becomes clear no character was actually used properly. I&#039;d say don&#039;t ever watch this series unless you&#039;re some kind of masochist, but actually you know what? If you&#039;re an aspiring writer or critic, you actually probably should watch this series, as its a good example of everything not to do when writing a story.

    My last review of the anime was a fairly impressed 8/10, back when 47 episodes had been released. After 40 more episodes have been released though, I have to sadly admit that I was wrong and I had misjudged it.<br />
.<br />

10/10<br />
<br />
To say that Arc V skyrocketed the game&#039;s sales after the failure of Zexal would be an understatement. While every yugioh series until now focused on its own mechanic (rituals for original, fusions for gx, synchros for 5ds and exceeds for zexal), Arc V adds its own mechanic, Pendulums, but pays equal attention to ALL the others as well. Quite honestly I never imagined a day

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207893">
        would come when I could play a deck that rituals/synchros/fuses/xyzes and possibly pendulums at the same time and NOT have balance issues with it. If you had told me something like that back when Zexal came out I would have called you a fool, since most decks back then couldn&#039;t even pull of a combination of TWO of these at the same time, let alone all of them together. But now here we are, in a golden, grand age for the game that rewards skilled players with incredible show-offing, that has successfully made me cut down on my food expenses to &quot;barely surviving&quot; so I could afford more cards. Kudos Konami.<br />
<br />
But enough about the actual game. The anime takes place at first in Miami City (yes, the ACTUAL Miami, there are even black people in it) and later goes all over the place (literally). Our protagonist, Sakaki Yuya, is the son of the famous missing enternetainer Sakaki Yusho, and tries to become a professional entertainer duelist himself. As an entertainer duelist, he sees it his job and personal philosophy to bring smiles to everyone through his dueling, including the audience and his opponents. He is by all means a pacifist, and therefore a tragic figure in a world where dimensions collide, misusing the duel monsters game that Yuya loves as a weapon. Oh yeah, spoilers.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS<br />
<br />
And really, that&#039;s where the great writing of Arc V truly shines. The same game that Yuya wants to use as a means to bring happiness, is instead continuously used to bring pain and misery and loss of human life, which continuously sends the &quot;clownish&quot; Yuya to depression (he has gone through a lot of those already and we&#039;re not nearly halfway through the anime). To bring an end to conflict, Yuya is constantly forced to take part in the conflict himself, LITERALLY becoming consumed by his inner demons as the mayhem continues to intensify.<br />
<br />
Apart from Yuya there are plenty of other characters, including the alternate versions of himself and his potential girlfriend Suzu, one pair from each dimension, the rest of the Lancers the &quot;good mastermind&quot; Akaba Reiji has gathered (imagine Kaiba from season one with Urahara leadership and manipulation qualities, simply epic), and then there are the various individuals from the other dimensions, my favourite of which is Sora. In general the character roster in ARC V is pretty impressive, with fairly diverse characters whose loyalties aren&#039;t always where they&#039;re supposed to be, and who can all get consumed by their own personal conflicts, burdening their individual missions. All in all, great writing for EVERYONE. Yes, I mean EVERYONE. Not just the protagonist and his nymphomaniac girlfriend. EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
Now there are some minor issues I have with Arc V, and I mean other than spending too much money on the game. First, wanting to place equal power and interest in the girls to attract female audience, the writers have Yuzu dash off at the start of the series, away from the rest of the cast, essentially playing in her own anime as she goofs off/flirts with Yuya&#039;s alter egos from various worlds. It can even be said that she has a reverse harem: The pacifist emo one, the angry driven vengeful one, the goofy cool funny one and even the freaking YANDERE one. Now, I have no problem with the female claiming her own harem, but there does need to be someone for the protagonist to save like a princess... And that someone ended up being Sora, a 10 year old BOY. In fact, in light of Yuzu never being near him, the depressed clown of a protagonist does have a habit of gathering around him and &quot;protecting&quot; waaaaaay underage boys, with Sora obviously being the favourite, which at times raises a few eyebrows.<br />
<br />
But that&#039;s all water under the bridge. As usual, Yugioh has perfected the art of doing character development through the duels themselves and the cards played in them, and by God, have they succeeded in Arc V. Even ignoring Yuya (whose main deck basically consists of a circus and fun and games when he&#039;s trying to be a pacifist and rampaging dragons when he goes all berserk), the vast majority of the characters&#039; decks reflect their personalities, with my favourite, again, being Sora. His deck consists of the cutesy Fluffals that are basically stuffed animals, which reflect the cute kid he was pretending to be at the start of the series. He then combines these cute stuffed animals with saws, scissors, chains etc etc through fusion, creating terrifying 5 Nights at Freddie&#039;s monstrosities that reflect the true, twisted-self he was hiding beneath the cute bravado. And again of course, that&#039;s just an example. The vast majority of the characters work like that, and it&#039;s doing the series WONDERS.<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least, Arc V is doing a FANTASTIC job technically, with very good art, well chosen camera angles, perfectly expressioned faces, and of course, epic sound. In fact the sound department is another of Arc V&#039;s highlights, with Yuya&#039;s beautifully painful screams, Reiji&#039;s wonderfully arrogant voice, Serena&#039;s cute tomboyish military-talk (among many, many others) being accompanied by a soundtrack that easily rivals 5ds&#039;, which will always get your blood bumping and ready for a duel.<br />
<br />
All in all: A fantastic job. First time in a while you get the feeling Konami hired actual script writers instead of marketing advisers and it really shows. Excellent at everything, my only regret is that between arc V and Steam Sales, I will have to survive on campus food for a while (ew).<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
-Everything.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-...I guess the slightly yaoish feel when Yuya is near boys, if you&#039;re annoyed by that sort of thing.<br />
-HOW?! HOW DID I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY...?!

Story: 8<br />
The series start really slow at first, it made me wan&#039;t to drop the anime for the first 6 episodes, but as the series goes deeper, the pacing gets better. The story is pretty unique for the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows as Yuya wants to entertain people by dueling, just like how was his father. It also showed all of the real life summons (Fusion, XYZ, and Synchro) which was really cool, because the other shows just focused on one (because then, every deck in the show would be focused to do the featured

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191887">
        summon).  It also introduced a new type of summon, the Pendulum Summon.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
It is great, but there are inconsistencies with the animations sometimes.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The sound duels are getting better and better, which is great. Wonderful OP/EDs too that goes with the theme of the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
Well, there are interesting ones and there aren&#039;t, Yuya is a pretty decent character too, a pacifist who deeply cares for his friends.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
The duels are well-scripted, which is the most enjoyable thing in the show. The art and sounds goes well with each other too, for more epicness. <br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
This show is the best among the Yu-Gi-Oh! shows that ever aired in my opinion.

    I was about to drop the Yu-Gi-Oh anime series with Zexal. Seriously. <br />
But Arc-V brought me back. <br />
As a real life YGO player and an anime fan, I can say that this series satisfied me.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10: The story is about a young boy named Yuya Sakaki trying to become as great as his father once was. It&#039;s pretty standard for a plot, but the way they developed it while including the three main card mechanic (Fusion/Synchro/XYZ) along with the new Pendulum Summon was good. It starts a bit slow and might not avoid confusion sometimes (even though it might just be intended).<br />
<br />
Art 8/10: The animation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180116">
        is as good as Zexal&#039;s, maybe better. It is very fluid when some boss monsters are summoned.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10: Yuya&#039;s dream is to become a professional entertainment duelist. This time around, we actually have a character with a set goal in mind, and somewhat better dueling skills (compared to Yuma). He had a few good development episodes as well. Other characters such as Yuzu and Shun were pretty nice as well, Yuzu also being a reminiscent of Akiza from 5D&#039;s as we actually got to see her duel a few times. In general, the characters seem less forced.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10: While other series focused on their own main summoning ways (Fusion/Synchro/XYZ), this one brings all of them together, which somewhat makes me nostalgic (I&#039;m a synchro player in real life, so I feel pumped every time I see a synchro summon in the anime).<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10: This is Zexal done right. Nuff said.

    Good lord, I never thought I&#039;d see such a train wreck of a Yu-Gi-Oh show. So I will begin by prefacing this, this show is bad and the fact that it&#039;s bad has nothing to do with the hype it was receiving, that&#039;s just an excuse people use to defend garbage and they are more than likely lying through their rectum holes but fail to see that lie through their impenetrable condom of bias and utter ignorance. So let&#039;s just get to it because lord knows I&#039;m not gonna change anyone&#039;s opinion if they still think it&#039;s good because they&#039;ve drunkenly stumbled past the point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246066">
        of no return.<br />
<br />
Story 2-<br />
I&#039;ve never had a story with so much build up that then proceeds to comically fall flat on its face while pretending to know what it is doing. It&#039;s like one of those songs that have an extremely large buildup only to lead into a pathetic drop that makes me wince. Let&#039;s analyse this by arcs shall we? Because this show is so long that this is the only real logical way to go through this.<br />
<br />
Pre-Arc League Championship 1-26<br />
When a lot of people point out the amazing writing at the start of the show, they don&#039;t mean here, this part was just your average 100+ episode show long buildup where it just introduces the characters while also throwing some mysteries here and there while also giving certain characters motives, it&#039;s really nothing special and is maybe a bit better than the start of Zexal. Overall this arc was fine, nothing really special about it other than building up the story around Shun.<br />
<br />
Arc League Championship 27-46<br />
This is the Arc that got many people invested into Arc-V as it introduces Heartland into the plot along with Academia the main villains, they were able to portray the threat that Academia pose fairly well in this Arc by showing that there was nowhere they wouldn&#039;t attack meaning that the safety if the characters were put into heavy jeopardy, this was also back when the Obelisk Force were an actual threat as characters would usually have to team up to defeat them, this arc also played with the Yu-Boys and the potential relation they had with each other, it was a good buildup arc and overall an extremely well written arc thanks to how most of the characters were portrayed.<br />
<br />
Friendship Cup 50-75<br />
This is where cracks began to appear in the show, this arc was mainly focused on providing hype for the legacy characters that were returning from other shows, this was fine but this also meant that tonnes of Arc-V characters were getting kicked out of the limelight. Overall this arc has very little progression, however they did introduce the dimensional war with this arc but it was unfortunately accompanied by the fact that all they did was fight in a tournament, however there was a nice prison arc which was fairly entertaining but they didn&#039;t even explore pass the city, yes that&#039;s right, the Synchro dimension was just reduced down to a city. There was this whole thing built up with Yuya and Yugo synchronising but it never happened again, so that was nice. This just felt like a boring excuse to use two cash cow characters while writing the story around them. <br />
<br />
Friendship Cup Finals 76-99<br />
This is where the arc began to really drag out (yes these two are pretty much the same arc) it was just simply tying up the stuff that was happening in the previous arc, there were some nice bits of information about Academia here and there but that was about it, the villain was the only star of this arc.<br />
<br />
Heartland City 100-125<br />
Good lord where to begin with this dreadful mess of an arc, it managed to make an arc with 25 episodes feel rushed and lazy, don&#039;t be fooled by the name either, next to none of it is focused on Heartland. Kaito is introduced as some sort of omnipotent God even though is personality is as boring as Reijis. Heartland began promising as it shows the gang the results of the war, allowing for interaction between those who have everything and those who have lost everything. It was a nice start until the jobbing lord Edo and the bipolar Tyler Sisters were brought into the fray and before you could say &quot;BUT YOU STILL TAKE THE DAMAGE!!!&quot; They were Egaod into oblivion and had a completely unnecessary change of heart. Then we move onto the Battle Beast, oh boy, I&#039;ve never seen something try so hard to mask it was filler while also making it seem so insulting, they did some pointless things such as carding Crow and Tsukikage, while also breaking Sawatari&#039;s duel disk, only for it all to be completely reversed later on, which made the arc even more insulting. They also made the Battle Beast into an ally, only for him to never show up again. All in all, this was filler the arc.<br />
<br />
Duel Academy 126-148<br />
This arc started off fairly hype, it had some amazing duels such as Yuri VS Yuya but it also had some head scratching duels such as Yuri VS Yusho in which Yusho gets fodderised which is the worst power balance that I&#039;ve ever had the misfortune of seeing all the Yu-boys then merged into the being known as Zarc which meant that watchers were finally going to get some plot tied up, there was the Arc- Area project which helped get some clarity on the Yu-girls who had now become Kotori 2.0 but that went nowhere. It then proceeded to the Zarc duels, which ended up being 5 episodes of &quot;I can job harder than you&quot; all leading up to a half baked conclusion in which Ray (The Yu-girls combo) was there but also not there penetrated Zarc with every bodies help except Sawatari&#039;s. We then get into the section where the dimension gets reset which involves an episode of everybody getting their memories back while Yuya fights Gong, Tsukikage and Sawatari. How did Reiji know about the past? Who knows. Certainly not the writers anyway. Yuya must then spend the rest of the show trying to make a baby smile by beating all of the lancers, truly riveting. Except for the fact that Gong beat Tsukikage and Sawatari (which had me triggered) and not him. They then shoehorn in a pointless Jack duel because Ono has a hard-on for 5D&#039;s and then proceeds to duel the &quot;rival&quot; Reiji, after all that garbage what is the ending we are presented with? The baby smiles and everything goes back to normal, oh except for the fact that all the Yu-boys are dead except Yuya and all of the Yu-girls are dead except Yuzu while Shun just looks on and smiles as his entire goal throughout the show is immediately crushed and he just takes it up the ass, the pendant is never explained and Reira is still a baby, there is no clarity on what happened to Roger and Barret, oh and Sawatari never wins a proper duel.<br />
<br />
This show is made much worse when you&#039;re having to watch it weekly, however I did enjoy getting treated like I&#039;m retarded throughout the show. People say that the show was going for a bittersweet ending but it is obvious that was not the case with the way everyone was acting, also bad writing doesn&#039;t make stuff bittersweet.<br />
<br />
Art 5-<br />
The art could be good at times but there were many animations issues along the way. During the Friendship Cup arc, many animators were taken away to work on DSOD, meaning they basically had the B-Team working on it, and this made it look like garbage. Near the end of the show one of the animators admitted that the staff were just telling them to do whatever meaning that they had no clue on what to draw, and it really shows as a lot of stuff near the end looks really stiff and lifeless. However when the art and animation looked good, it looked REALLY good, which made it all the more refreshing when they actual had a good animator on the job.<br />
<br />
Sound 9-<br />
Music is very subjective but what I will say is the Arc-V&#039;s consistency lied with its music, all the songs sounded like actual effort was put into it, the voice acting was also extremely well done as the actors were always able to convey the correct emotion for the correct situation.<br />
<br />
Characters 3-<br />
When people try and defend this shows characters (as shown on MAL) they only usually give 2 or 3 examples like they pretend the cast doesn&#039;t exist, well from a writing standpoint half of them don&#039;t but I will analyse the Lancers, some legacy characters, Yu-boys and girls, villains and some of the supporting cast.<br />
<br />
Yuya- The physical embodiment of egao, his only character development happens in the first few episodes where he stops being a little depressed clown. His berserk mode isn&#039;t even character development because it isn&#039;t part of his actual personality and just a wombo combo between him and Yuto. Other than that the show tries to pretend like his dueling style and knowledge of entertainment has evolved except that it hasn&#039;t and he literally acts the exact same throughout the entire show and people pretend that he&#039;s changed. His dueling style has changed from spamming action cards to spamming action cards with extra deck spamming on top, it&#039;s not fun to watch. He&#039;s like if Medaka was written to be a legitimate character instead of parodying talk-no-jutsu <br />
<br />
Yuri- Originally his character is extremely entertaining as he has his own twisted style of entertainment dueling which makes him really sadistic and provides umph to whatever he does. Unfortunately he shows up too little for that personality to evolve apart from his final duel with Yuya in which you finally see desperation from him. After the Zarc incident his personality has a complete 180 and now he is Yuya&#039;s best buddy, unfortunately that&#039;s all we see as he barely speaks at the end of the show.<br />
<br />
Yuto- A nicer Shun, I would&#039;ve like to have known more about him if he didn&#039;t die like 2 episodes in.<br />
<br />
Yugo- Pretty fun dude to watch, probably has the most normal personality of the Yu-boys as he doesn&#039;t swing one was or another on the insanity scale, he&#039;s just a nice dude who likes dueling while relying on luck (like Joey) and looking up girls skirts, possibly one of the most relatable characters in the show, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Yuzu- Starts off as a developing duelist with a kind personality but strong dueling skills, she shows promise as a better Asuka but then proceeds to turn into Yuya.Wav as she constantly howls Yuya&#039;s name like she is about to climax.<br />
<br />
Serena- I do not see the appeal of this character, she&#039;s a strong duelist with strong ideals on how duels should be properly fought, that&#039;s it though, she can be kind at times but she seems like a walking robot the rest of it. They try and shoehorn in some sort of relationship with Yuri at the end even though they have never even interacted.<br />
<br />
Ruri- I dunno, seems like a nice girl who wanted to bang Yuto, maybe if the show remembered that she existed then maybe we would know more.<br />
<br />
Rin- *burp*<br />
<br />
Gongenzaka- One of the few good characters, he is shown to be a character who is extremely loyal to Yuya but also holds him back when necessary, an extremely level headed character who sticks by is dueling method no matter what which provided for a very entertaining duel of beliefs. His personality developed to be very excepting of entertainment dueling even though originally showed distaste for when Dennis did it. Overall a fun character to watch as is personality is consistent but not to the point where it&#039;s boring.<br />
<br />
Sawatari- Oh boy where do I start. I&#039;ve never watched a show and felt bad for liking my favourite character until now. While being the only person who is actually good at entertainment dueling, he is extremely underused and treated like absolute trash. His W/L record is so bad to the point where his only 1 on 1 win was against one of his lackeys in episode 7, that duel wasn&#039;t even fully shown. He starts off as an arrogant punk who just cares about doing whatever it takes to win (which is ironic as all he ever does is lose) but after is first duel with Yuya and his duel with Yuto his thirst for victory dies down a bit and he begins to translate his arrogance into something that would shine really well, entertainment dueling. He develops a bromance with Crow which comes completely out of left field, however Crows death shows Sawatari that his actions can have consequences, which is a first for him. The rest of his screen time is him being a narrator of duels or him losing to some brand new character to show off how &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; they are when in reality putting these new characters against someone who always loses will mean nothing after a while. It&#039;s almost like the writers forgot to write him into the script and the animators were like &quot;Oh crap! Sawatari is in this show isn&#039;t he!? Let&#039;s just draw him in over there.&quot; It&#039;s actually insulting for someone who was built up as a more equal rival than the actual rival is tossed aside to be a butt-monkey, Sawatari is the embodiment of Arc-V, wasted potential. <br />
<br />
Tsukikage- It&#039;s like they took Gong&#039;s dueling ideals and put it into a character and turned that character into a ninja. You need an actual personality to be good. Tsukikage is just plain boring.<br />
<br />
Shun- How can so many fans flock around a character who can turn any semblance of personality into something more lifeless than my dead granddad is beyond my knowledge. However people will defend Shun &#039;till the Raidraptors come home. He has the same goal as Yuto but comes off as much more of an asshole while still coming off as extremely boring at the same time. There&#039;s some great conflict between him and Sora but in the end he&#039;s just a husk of a character. <br />
<br />
Dennis- Pretty good character honestly, starts off as a nice Yusho clone but then begins to show his darker side which was a great twist as he was a very mysterious character, he then has a crisis when dueling Yusho then cards himself. Then proceeds to have a 180 personality change which wasn&#039;t my taste but I can see the appeal.<br />
<br />
Reira- Starts off great with her timid personality and it gets even better when you see hints of an abused past. Unfortunately I can&#039;t remember anything else about Reira. Baby Reira is stupid and honestly a waste of space though.<br />
<br />
Reiji- I&#039;ve honest to good never seen a more boring rival in Yu-Gi-Oh. Heck, I don&#039;t even see him as a rival, I see him more as a mentor, he was never once equal with Yuya yet they still tried to market him as a rival, he wasn&#039;t even a good rival, he suffers yet again from the Mr. Boring trope and all he ever does is spew Keikaku. He&#039;s a bad rival and should have never been marketed as such.<br />
<br />
Roger- Great villain, probably one of the best characters in Arc-V, he starts off as a smug guy who thinks everything is going according to plan but it then shows that he is in way over his head and starts breaking down when characters are able to out think him, really fun to watch, wish we could&#039;ve seen more of him later on.<br />
<br />
Crow- It&#039;s Crow, he&#039;s a crappy generic character and just exists for Blackwings, all he does is shaft other characters to the side so they can shill more Blackwings.<br />
<br />
Jack- Watch 5D&#039;s if you want a good portrayal of Jack because this one is pretty uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Sora- At the start Sora was a great villain, he starts off as a strong duelist who seems to be on the side of good, but then his demented personality begins to show in his duel with Shun which shows how overwhelming his sense of superiority is, however he doesn&#039;t let this get over his head as he still respects Yuri. He then unfortunately, just like many characters in the show, does a complete 180 and is suddenly all hunky dory with everyone, it was at that point I stopped caring about Sora.<br />
<br />
Shivers Kid- Die.<br />
<br />
I wrote less on the legacy characters (only the ones that matter anyway) because they already hog up too much of the show, they ain&#039;t hogging up this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 4-<br />
I enjoyed watching the Miami championship and the Synchro arc, however everything else was a pain to get through and the fact that it watched it weekly made that fact even worse. It got to the point where I didn&#039;t care what happened unless Sawatari showed up and even then I&#039;d leave with a sour taste in my mouth because he&#039;d always lose.<br />
<br />
Overall 3-<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V is the definition of a train wreck. Next to no plot points were ended in a satisfying manner if at all. All the Arc-V characters were shafted aside by legacy characters meaning that even though those characters have great counterparts in their respectful series, Arc-V just has a pile of half baked characters that I never want to see again. Overall I&#039;m giving it a 3 because the amount of positives cannot even hope to touch the insurmountable amount of negatives that Arc-V left in your kitchen. I just home Vrains doesn&#039;t get the same treatment. <br />
If I could sum up Arc-V, it would be....<br />
<br />
                                ACTION DUEL! EGAORATION!!!!

    Yugioh Arc V is the 5th installment of the Yugioh franchise, it is not the best anime within the franchise. (This is my second review, it is just updated)<br />
<br />
The storyline starts a bit slow and repetitive sometimes near the beginning because it was meant to introduce to Pendulum Summoning as its main concept in dueling. The story does get interesting after episode 20 by how it introduced the darkness within Yuya and his counterparts. In addition, the story does become unpredictable and interesting as its strong points. Yet, it is not prefect on how the plot does feel rushed near the last couple episodes. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243626">
        raise questions without having answers on how it is important to the plot as one of flaws of this franchise. For instance, a duel occurs in one episode when it should be in two or three episodes. I mean some duels feel significant to the plot in character development or other aspects; yet, it does not happen which makes the plot feel rushed and flawed sometimes. <br />
<br />
For the characters, there is a variety of side characters that has a role in the plot, however, does not utilize their role at its fullest since some of them appear as the audience after fulfilling their role in Yuya&#039;s development. <br />
<br />
Even though, there are flaws in the side characters&#039; roles, the development of the main characters was fleshed to its full potential which makes the story strong at some points. In the beginning, Yuya was seen as a cheerful and goofy boy, who focuses on entertainment dueling like his father. As the story progress, he experiences drastic changes within himself, learns about his counterparts and how it connects to his identity. I won&#039;t mention the details of his identity because I may spoil it for new viewers who are starting to watch this franchise.<br />
<br />
Similar to having a female lead in the franchise as the main character, Yuzu portrays her role in helping Yuya fulfill his by being his mentor throughout the story. On contrast, she has not given enough spotlight as the story progresses which makes her seen as a side character than as the main character.<br />
<br />
Akaba Reiji, the main rival of Yuya, was developed strongly in his character and role for Yuya&#039;s development. His role influence Yuya to face his inner struggles and his role of being an entertainment duelist which is one of the strong points of this franchise.<br />
<br />
The music was used greatly on how it utilized the duels and moments within emotional or comedic scenes. It is similar to the VA, who portray the characters well.<br />
<br />
The animation have its pros and cons because some episodes have good animation and opposite on other episodes. It was probably the quality of the animation was transferred to the movie, Dark Side of Dimension which cause the animation in Yugioh Arc V to drop.<br />
<br />
Overall, Yugioh Arc V have its strong and weak points, in terms of the plot of the story and characters&#039; role and development. It is sad that Arc V have ended; but, I enjoyed watching it as a whole.

    At first with Zexal letdown I&#039;m a little skeptical about this series. How boy it manage to surpass my expectation in every possible way.<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
<br />
As per YGO tradition the story start slow with first few episode focusing on character introduction and explaining new game mechanic Pendulum Summon. But over time the series took interesting turn of event and thing become more interesting. Lot of thing that seems to be insignificant at first turned into important foreshadowing for future episode.<br />
<br />
Character - 10/10<br />
<br />
This is the best part of Arc-V. Character are very dynamic and get great development. Usually female character is useless but not here. Yuzu

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184921">
        is great duelist and she advance the plot further that many joking she is the real protagonist of the series. Many character that look like going to be one shot duelist give impact for plot later on.<br />
<br />
Duel Choreography - 8.5/10<br />
<br />
Unlike previous series Konami give a curve ball here. Instead of focusing only on new summoning mechanic Konami bring back many Extra Deck summon and not just that but it is also important plot point. Too bad that Ritual Summon didn&#039;t get focused here (so far). Duel here is also very meta like how real life duel will be. There is still downside though in form of Action Card that scattered on the field when Action Duel start.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
<br />
Of course as long time YGO fan I&#039;m enjoying this very much. There are many improvement here and there from previous series. Not only anime but TCG &amp; OCG also get positive impact from the series.<br />
<br />
Overall - 9.5/10<br />
<br />
This is great series for YGO fans. Complex character and plot along with likable duel. Truly the best from franchise.

    Let’s be honest guys, not everyone was happy about Yu-Gi-Oh! ZeXal. While the show was an overall critical and commercial success, some older fans felt alienated by it. And I can see why, what with the seemingly more childish tone (It wasn’t, sure, but the art style certainly gave off that impression) and a somewhat irritating protagonist. So as such, Studio Gallop brought back 5D’s’ director to try and bring in older audiences while still appeasing to the new crowd.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the result was the single most hated Yu-Gi-Oh! series in Japan, and America wasn’t much kinder to it after a while. That my friends, is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302065">
        Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.<br />
<br />
I should start off by saying that dividing when a story arc starts and ends in this show is a nightmare. The Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki mostly divides them from when an Opening is replaced, however this can make Arcs start and end at awkward points. On the other hand, judging them by what’s in the plot makes some Arcs seem too short, so if you disagree with the way I divided these arcs, I’m sorry, but this is the best I could find.<br />
<br />
1st Arc: Pre-Miami Championship Arc (Episodes 1-26):<br />
<br />
To be fair, the show doesn’t start off that bad, in fact I’ll admit: The first 50 or so episodes of this show are surprisingly decent. Similar to the original Manga, it starts off with the right mix of mystery and slice of life stuff. We know that there’s something going on, however for now the cast doesn’t really have any reason to get involved nor do they know what is even going on.<br />
<br />
That said, it’s not as if this arc is perfect. Like with the original Manga, the quality of these stories is very much hit or miss. Sometimes it can be pretty decent and other times… not so much. Still though, it is mostly good.<br />
<br />
I will also admit that the characters all have good starting points. Yuya can be somewhat self-centered, but is still clearly a nice guy. Yuzu has a lot of room to grow as a Duelist, but clearly shows potential. Gongenzaka… is clearly not important but that won’t stop the show from trying to make us think he is.<br />
<br />
Then there’s Akaba Reiji, who is sometimes hailed as one of the best rivals in the franchise, and while I disagree, I can see why. Reiji has a weird mix of a survival of the fittest and end justifies the means mentalities, and overall it makes for a rather interesting character. My issues with him are moreso present later on down the line, but overall I do feel he’s one of this show’s best characters.<br />
<br />
However he’s not the best character. That honor goes to Kurosaki Shun. He’s initially introduced as a generally neutral force, clearly being against something, someone, but we don’t know who. He’s legitimately menacing, and as we’ll see later on, he does develop rather naturally. There’s also his partner Yuto, who had the potential to become one of the show’s best characters, but as we’ll see, they wasted him.<br />
<br />
Either way, Arc-V does start off strong. Let’s see if it can keep its momentum.<br />
<br />
2nd Arc: Miami Championship Arc (Episodes 27-53):<br />
<br />
This is Arc-V’s best arc. In some ways, it kinda reminds me of Hunter X Hunter’s Hunter Exam arc, specifically the last part: Both shows start off as a seemingly normal tournament arc, but then stuff goes to hell fast. Of course it’s nowhere near close that masterpiece, but this show does its own thing as well by showing us most of the Tournament while keeping things interesting by having all of the stuff having to do with the main plot relegated to the background, but still progressing at a reasonable pace. It also contains the show’s best Duel: Kurosaki Shun VS Shiunin Sora. I won’t spoil it, but all I’ll say is that it was freaking awesome.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it also plants the seeds for what would become the show’s biggest issues, but honestly they aren’t so bad in this particular arc. Yuto dying would cause issues down the line as its clear even in this arc he’s not entirely dead, but here it makes sense and it does help create mystery. It also helps progress the mystery of a mysterious force possessing Yuya, which later on would turn out to be kinda bland, but here it works just fine.<br />
<br />
It also introduces Best Girl Serena. This girl is a badass and I love most of her scenes, and she does have a very natural character arc that does play into her character flaws introduced early on. My only complaint with her is that her redemption arc is done a bit too quickly yet also slowly. Like, she finds out that she’s working for the wrong side very early on, yet she doesn’t super definitely find out until near the end. It also introduces Dennis, who’s just so fun that I love him. My only real issue with him is that the cast takes way too long to find out he’s a double agent and his redemption came kinda out of nowhere. Either way, I do like him.<br />
<br />
Okay, good job Arc-V. What’s next?<br />
<br />
3rd Arc: Friendship Cup Arc (Episodes 54-75):<br />
<br />
Oh right, the show started to suck.<br />
<br />
Okay, the Friendship Cup Arc isn’t that bad, but its issue is that it feels like padding. The main plot is put on hold for a good 20 or so episodes just for some other Tournament Arc. What’s worse is that this isn’t even the good kind of out of nowhere Tournament Arc, in which every Duel helps the characters Develop, most of the Duels in the first Round are filler!<br />
<br />
That said, I will give it this: This Arc is very good at world building. The Arc-V version of Neo Domino City is clearly not the same one as in 5D’s, and it does a great job at making it feel unique. Also, while most of the Duels are unremarkable filler, the arc does end on a high note with my second favorite Duel in this show: Kurosaki Shun Vs Dennis Mackfield (Yeah Shun got most of the best Duels. What can I say? Raid Raptors are awesome).<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, Yuto is put on standby for now and is instead replaced by Yugo (Who is weirdly enough played by the twin brother of Yuto’s Seiyuu. Weird, I know). If I could compare these two to anyone, then Yuto would be Roxas and Yugo would be Ventus. Whereas Yuto is a bit of a loner and moody, Yugo is happy and upbeat. My thoughts on these two are also similar to the characters I compared them to, as while I do like Yuto, Yugo is a character who I can see the appeal of, but I personally don’t care for. What’s worse is that Yugo had a lot of room to grow, but the guy gets no development whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Then there are the infamous Legacy Characters. Yes, this show decided to bring back characters from previous Yu-Gi-Oh! shows. Specifically this arc brings back Crow Hogan and Jack Atlas from 5D’s. While Jack is as great as always, there’s just too much of him. He gets to Duel Yuya three times (Once in this Arc, again in the next one, and then an out of nowhere round three in the last arc) and overall steals too much of the spotlight. Also, they never even once mention his love of Cup Ramen. Crow is even worse, being presented as unfairly powerful and stealing away the spotlight for better characters.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not the worst Arc ever, but not what I would call good.<br />
<br />
4th Arc: Friendship Cup Finals Arc (Episodes 76-99)<br />
<br />
This one is hard to judge. Technically speaking, it is better than the previous Arc as it does a lot more right, but it also does a lot more wrong too. On the one hand, the plot begins progressing again, characters get some development, and overall it is a more focused arc. On the other hand, the structure is all over the place (it once again tries to not be a standard tournament arc only to then suddenly switch back to being one just so Yuya can have his rematch with Jack), characters that should’ve gotten focused on don’t get any spotlight, and overall it’s just all over the place.<br />
<br />
Take for instance Serena. She gets a Duel with Yugo in which she gets a decent amount of development, however then she does absolutely nothing for the rest of the show. The same can be said about Yuzu, who barely gets to do anything after this arc. Kurosaki also gets thrown out of the plot halfway through for some reason, and Yugo has still not gotten a single bit of character development! What’s worse is that the arc pretends as if Yuya has grown by saying he’s now using his own words instead of those his father used, and while that is true, that isn’t his main character flaw anyways, and that flaw is never addressed.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, let’s talk about Roget, the big bad for this Arc. My thoughts on him are similar to those I have for Father Enrico Pucci from Stone Ocean. A villain the plot treats as if he’s really, really smart… but is actually really, REALLY dumb. Dude makes so many rookie mistakes it’s hard to take him seriously as a threat.<br />
<br />
So once again, not the worst Arc ever, but it’s not good either.<br />
<br />
5th Arc: Heartland City Arc (Episodes 100-111)<br />
<br />
Yeah this is a short Arc. On the one hand, that makes it hard to hate… on the other hand that just makes the flaws more obvious.<br />
<br />
So finally the main plot is back in the spotlight… the problem becomes the plot is pretty dumb once you stop and think about it. Like, the part about merging the Dimensions makes sense, but everything else… not so much. If anything, this arc feels like a person stopping at a gas station during a long travel. It’s necessary… but you don’t want to stay there too long. To give it credit, the setting does look pretty good.<br />
<br />
Sadly, this is where all of my issues with Yuya begin appearing. He is selfish, self-righteous, follows his father’s ideal to make people smile as if it’s the only thing that is correct in this world, and is also less so a character than a caricature. Basically, he’s Emiya Shirou without everything that made him a great character. What’s worse is that the way the plot is frames is so as Yuya is always in the right, which bother the ever living hell out of me, to say the least. Even worse is that this comes at the expense of Yuto’s character, who makes the damn good point that there’s no way to reason to Academia, yet Yuya just ignores his feeling for what he feels is right.<br />
<br />
Now how about those Legacy characters? Oh right, they suck too. Kaito goes through a rushed version of his character arc in ZeXal, Asuka is pointless and does absolutely nothing, but MAN is Edo the worst of them all. To put it bluntly: Remember the calm, cool yet also revenge driven while still kind-hearted Edo from GX? Well, Arc-V Edo is nothing like that. He’s immature, bratty, incompetent, and his redemption arc is just badly done. Basically, he sucks.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not that good all things considered, but it could be worse.<br />
<br />
6th Arc: Academia Arc (Episodes 112-135)<br />
<br />
Oh no, this is where that worse begins.<br />
<br />
Yup, the Arc that was so bad that the show’s ratings dropped like a bomb. And yeah, it’s just that bad. To start off with, there is way too much filler. Many of the Duels don’t amount to anything, and overall it just feels like a bunch of ads for new Cards. Also, the Cast is awfully misused. Barely anyone does anything of note, and overall the Arc feels empty, which it shouldn’t.<br />
<br />
However it’s with the characters that this arc falls apart. Dennis’ redemption Arc is extremely rushed; Rin and Ruri get no personality whatsoever, and my God was Akaba Leo a terrible villain. Let’s see, he’s a hypocrite, is never called out on his actions, and he just suddenly turns to the good guys side after a while with no explanation given. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the worst villains in the franchise!<br />
<br />
Hell, wanna know who this show’s best villain is? Yuri, Leo’s creepy underling. He’s legitimately menacing, competent, and is just plain batshit insane. He’s nowhere even close to being one of the franchise’s best villains, but it’s enough to at least make him better than all the other villains in this show.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, the big twist was pretty good, and the last Duel of the Arc (Yuya Vs Yuri) was pretty decent. Too bad it leads to:<br />
<br />
Final Arc: Supreme King Arc (Episodes 136-148):<br />
<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the worst Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc yet (Maybe, I’ve put VRains On Hold for a while). Let’s see, the arc has absolutely no sense of pacing? Check. The characters are wasted? Check. The few characters that aren’t wasted get unsatisfying ends to their character Arcs? Double Check. This my friends, is every bad Shounen finale out there!<br />
<br />
The Villain isn’t much better. Zarc is kinda like Aŋra Mainyu before Hollow Ataraxia came out. He has an interesting backstory and concept… but has absolutely no personality. It’s even worse in Zarc’s case, as they build up to him like madmen… and then he’s effectively OTK’d. Whoops!<br />
<br />
Oh, and the finale sucks too. Acting as if everything’s fine when it really, REALLY isn’t. Basically, it’s just a bad arc.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
The show looks fine, I guess, but I can’t help but feel this is a downgrade from ZeXal. A particularly big issue is that the CGI just looks lifeless. At least ZeXal tried to make them look somewhat Cel Shaded, here they don’t even try. To make matters worse, most Duels rely on Action Cards, which are absolutely pointless and half the time are just generic. Basically, the show doesn’t look bad, but not great either.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I mean, it is fine, but not that many tracks stood out to me. I think one of the few that did was Yuya’s theme, which was apropiately energetic and I liked it. As far as the Openings and Endings go, the only ones I cared for were “Future Fighter”, “Burn!” and “Light Of Hope”. The rest I really didn’t care for.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Yet again we have a kinda amateurish cast. To be fair, Ono Kensho does a good enough job as Yuya, but damn compared to most of his other performances, it falls flat. Same goes for Hoyosa Yoshimasa for Reiji, though admittedly to a lesser extent. In particular, Namikawa Daisuke wasn’t very good as Akaba Leo. The only performance that stood out to me was Kinjo Yamato as Kurosaki, who did a great job. Plus, it’s Nossan from Kyoryuger! How could you not love him!? Everyone else is middle of the road though. Just to mention the few names I recognized (And I mean from Anime as I do recognize some of these guys from their apparences in Live-Action stuff) we have Fuchigami Mai, Yuuki Aoi, Touchi Hiroki and Kakihara Tetsuya.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Yeah, I didn’t really like this show. It’s not that I hate it, but man was it a letdown. It had the potential to be the best show in the franchise, but it ended up being the worst of them all. I can only recommend it as a curiosity.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 4/10

    Extremely minor spoilers ahead that really only increase the intrigue one might have in the series-----&gt;<br />
This is my first review: Initially, I was just writing a comment on my anime list for Arc-V but it ended up being so long that I decided I might as well post it here as well. Be gentle :)<br />
This was the Yu-Gi-Oh Arc thus far with the most story and depth of characters. The first 50 episodes or so are reminiscent of previous Yu-Gi-Oh seasons, introducing mechanics such as the new Pendulum summoning method, and contains classic scenarios like duel tournaments. Even then, the inter-dimensional aspects of the story

        still shine through the first 50 episodes, providing cryptic twists, betrayals and mysteries to be continued through the following Synchro, Xyz and Fusion dimensions. Unfortunately, the characters from previous seasons that do make reappearances in their respective dimension do not retain their memories from the events in the previous seasons, they still have the same personalities and the same decks, save the added pendulum cards or slight alterations. On top of the exciting story and likable characters, the show, unlike its predecessors focuses on more aspects of a duel than just introducing more and more examples of the season&#039;s highlighted summoning method. (I&#039;m looking at you Zexal, where every battle was just a competition to see who could summon the biggest Xyz monster, from regular Xyz to rank up Xyz to chaos Xyz it gets tiring you know.) Another likable feature in Arc-V is that the main character (Yuya), is not tied down by one or two rivals. In shows like Zexal, the MC&#039;s rivals were well known and set and you could obviously tell which future battles would occur. In 5Ds, Yusei&#039;s rival was obviously and predictably Jack Atlas for the first 50 episodes and then shifted towards the leader of the evil duelers in that show, which provided very obvious storytelling and guiding. In Arc-V, Yuya ends up fighting the largest variety of opponents to date, some friends, some foes, some even friend turned foe. The end result of Arc-V is not even remotely possible to accurately guess until dozens of episodes have been watched and allows for suspenseful watching, unsure of the future of the series. Most of all, Arc-V focuses on the relationship between Yuya and his monsters, his amazing cast of friends and supporters, and his ideal to duel like his father does, with a smile.<br />

    So far 18 episode in and I am thoroughly enjoying this series of Yugioh, Arc-V has a very interesting story created through a variety of mysterious characters. I hope we will get to see more of the currently mysterious characters such as the user of the Rank 4 XYZ dark rebellion Dragon, and another rank 4 XYZ monster has been confirmed but little is known about it and that&#039;s very interesting. <br />
<br />
This series starts slow, but now we are getting to see more interesting duels and duellists so there should be plenty to look forward too in this series. For anyone who hasn&#039;t seen this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156527">
        series but is a fan of the Yugioh series I would say at least give this series a chance, I know Pendulum summoning is not liked by everyone but the supporting characters make up for the Yuya&#039;s repeated summoning method. (Gongenzaka my favourite for his passionate reluctance to use any spells or traps, Love that guy= Episodes 10-12 I think was a fantastic duel from him) <br />
<br />
I also enjoy the main female character, she actually Duels which is a Nice change from Tori in Zexal but she isn&#039;t bad ass like Akiza and Alexis, Yuzuki tries, she isn&#039;t great but I still love her style.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if anyone would enjoy this series if they are not already familiar with the Yugioh series, I guess you could try it but it starts slow so it is difficult to get into. over time the plot becomes more interesting you can give it a go if you want. <br />
<br />
Personally I found Zexal 2 to be my favourite series and 5Ds was a close second.

    Dont watch this anime. I am a huge yugioh fan, ive seen every series, read every manga, play the card game, and by god, this is ....just the worst.<br />
<br />
I will give that some episodes actually have some good animation, and on the whole i did like the music in this series, but thats the best thing i can say about it.<br />
<br />
So lets start with the story. The first arc is not great, however in a stereotypical yugioh way. I mean, GX and Zexal didnt have strong starts either, right? In fact I would say Arc-V&#039;s start is better than Zexal&#039;s.It has your standard introducing characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262298">
        through pretty low stakes duels, and the show introduces a pretty neat concept. Using all the summoning methods. Now, this is a brilliant idea, and theoretically should make the duels in the series very interesting. However the duels in this series are by far the worst, and thats because of the other dueling gimmick they introduced. Action Cards. Granted, in the first arc, action cards werent that bad. They had varying effects and hell there were sometimes action traps that actually hurt you. So well it did provide a convenient excuse for the good guy of the episode to get out of a jam, it wasnt that bad. More on that later.The plot of the first season gradually builds up into what would become the premise of the whole series. There are 4 dimensions that are at war with each other. Sounds interesting doesnt it. They proceed to introduce a few characters from each dimension who make very cool introductions, and then move on to the second arc, which involves them going into one of those other dimensions.<br />
<br />
Now, here is where you start to see the signs of the show getting bad. The first dozen or so episodes in this arc are a complete stall for time with no real plot development.They introduce some more characters and include some fanservicey ones in order to draw in those 5Ds fans. Now having characters from 5Ds show up would be quite cool...if they were actually them. These are jsut characters with the same names and designs however, the Jack you meet isnt the one who fought the dark signers with yusei. its someone completely different. But back to the actual plot. Now youd think that , with interdimensional war happening, things would be pretty intense right? Nope! Most of this arc is taken up by a very slow tournament arc, that ends up doing nothing to help the cause of the heroes or the villains.Oh and all those cool characters who you wanted to see interact and develop with each other? Too bad, theyre locked in their rooms for most of hte arc.However there was a couple good episodes towards the end of this arc that really hyped up the overarching mysteries and seemed to really be leading somewhere, so i continued. Oh and the villain of this arc was a complete pushover who was so incompetent im surprised he managed to get his evil plan as far as he did.<br />
<br />
Now the third arc. Where it starts to get really terrible. So the cast gets separated again, jsut like at the start of the second arc! And of course most of the focus goes to the less interesting of the cast. They also introduce two GX legacy characters, who , if you love GX like i do are just....sad to watch in this series. They never get a proper win and , in fact, do more harm than good. This is where the series starts pushing the &quot;smile&quot; message way too hard. In a situation dealing with people living in a war zone and have gone through essentially genocide, and a group doing the genociding who believe that what they are doing is for the best, the solution is to have a really fun duel to solve it. And it works. All the problems there literally go away because of that.<br />
<br />
The fourth and final arc. What a mess. They finally give resolution to the mystery arc thats been building up and is very,very interesting in concept. However it is executed in the worst way possible. Its also around this time Action cards become unbearable. By this point you only see 3 different action cards.Evasion:negates an attack, Miracle:monster isnt destroyed and No Action:cancel another action card. Every . Single . Time.  Well, now since theyve bothered hyping up these action cards as the tools of the main heroes so often, surely they will be useful in defeating the big bad? No. The big bad prevents action cards from being used at all, which was nice to not have that annoyance for a few episodes but by god it made it so pointless. Now the duel against the big bad...just,so,so awful. He just defeats all of the  cast and then an insanely minor character shows up with the mother of all deus ex machinas and defeats him in one turn. The most unsatisfying final villain defeat ive ever seen in anime. They then spend the remaining 8 episodes getting a baby to smile. Not a joke, thats actually what happens and its as stupid as it sounds.<br />
<br />
Now on to the characters. The main character, Yuya, is insufferable. He starts off just eh, but with lots of room for development.However, he never actually develops. I would even argue he regresses. In a show that centered itself around a very serious conflict, youd think he would develop out of his naivete a little bit, or maybe not cling onto his childish ideals so hard. Hell ,even just have a few episodes where he gives up on them. But nope, if anything ,his stance on &quot;bring smiles through dueling&quot; only gets stronger every episode, and he goes around sequentially making everyone believe in it too.He learns nothing throughout the entire show, he doesnt even become a better duelist, he jsut gets more and more situational cards, which he wouldnt even need if he just played his deck well.<br />
<br />
The main female characters. So the main female character at the start is Yuzu and she starts it off pretty well, she gets a win against Yuya and actually does get some development. Then she gets kidnapped at the end of the arc and spends the rest of the show as a damsel in distress. Well, she does have about 7 episodes where she isnt lol. However, then they introduce Serena! Serena starts off even better than Yuzu and also gets some really good development. However after the second arc, she gets captured and also becomes a plot device. The other two girls, Rin and Ruri, are kidnapped before the show even starts and generally do nothing.<br />
<br />
Other characters. while a lot fo them start off strong and get a good 2 or 3 episodes focused on them, theyre generally dropped off and just spout  the same smile rhetoric as Yuya, dont get their arcs resolved, or both! Mostly both. Hell 6 of them end up dead at the end of the show and nobody really makes that much of a mention of it and they all act like its a happy ending.<br />
<br />
Villains. arc v only really has 4 villains, and im going to go through them all, so this section will be a bit spoilery.<br />
<br />
Roger:Huge idiot. His entire , very flawed, plan is to kidnap Reiji in order to use it as leverage to become more powerful than Reiji&#039;s father. However the audience already knows this is a futile endeavor as Shun tried this very early on , and it was made clear that Reiji&#039;s father didnt give a fuck about him.His dueling skills are also atrocious. He wouldve lost to two minor characters if it werent for this ridiculous system he set up where he got to try again and again if he lost.<br />
<br />
Leo:what a joke. This guy is built up as the villain for most of the series, and he is just an insane idiot. He had every single opportunity to stop the heroes from winning, and to succeed, but he makes the stupidest decisions possible. He nearly gets defeated by Yuya and Reiji and only doesnt lose because the duel gets stopped. Then he goes on to duel against the real big bad of the series, and loses in one turn. he doesnt even get to play a card.<br />
<br />
Zarc: The real big bad. This is where lots of spoilers come in. So hes the combined &quot;original&quot; form of Yuya, Yuto,Yugo and Yuri. Sounds cool in concept. Having someone with aspects of each of them would be interesting. However hes just an omnicidal maniac who stomps everyone he duels, until he gets defeated by a huge deus ex machina.<br />
<br />
Yuri:The only actually good villain. He was fun to watch, had an interesting deck, and was all around a troll. Sadly he was heavily underused.<br />
<br />
The duels themselves were just...so boring. Even putting aside action cards, no real interesting strategies were used, and everything just went on the ol&#039; &quot;bring out ace monster, sit on it until you win&quot;. The mosnter designs were not very good.The only deck i can say has interesting designs is Shun&#039;s.they were either waaaay too &quot;cute&quot; and childish,or were weird mashes of stuff together.<br />
<br />
So, to recap, dont watch this anime.

My first review here, so I apologize if the set up is not to your liking. However, I thought that a lot more people needed to give this anime a try, especially since many people have given up on the series. If you want to know, there is a brief comparison of this and the other yugioh series down near the bottom. It explains each of their weaknesses, and how Arc V has overcome them.<br />
<br />
Going to start with the overall rating, which you can use as a quick review. So, overall, despite the lower art and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193617">
        sound values, this series gets a 10 out of 10. The story subtly introduces important plot points from very early on, and brings everything together in a timely and well thought out manner. The art was amazing for yugioh, good for anime. Sound: it had some catchy tunes, and was a bit better than a lot of anime, but other than the super catchy ones, was pretty average. Enjoyment: it kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat. Actually still is, and I can&#039;t wait to see more! <br />
<br />
Next: You probably want to know about the new dueling gimmicks, and if they are stupid or not. Well I can tell you that they aren&#039;t, although you will probably think so at first. With the invention of &quot;real solid vision&quot;, the fields and the monsters become real when playing the game(think of duels of darkness). Spread across these fields are weapons called &quot;action cards&quot; which are basically quick play spell cards that you don&#039;t have to draw to get. However, you have to find the action cards first(which can be hard at times), and even then you can only have one in your hand at a time. Action cards make the duels a lot more interesting, because characters will move around on the field(sometimes with the aid of their monsters), looking for these cards, and characters other than the main character can and will use them. Because the monsters and the field are real, Dueling has evolved more into the show business side of entertainment, unlike the rest of the series. So characters will often legitimately be in the spotlight, and they always do their best to put on a good show. Which is why it seems a little stupid at first (kinda like &quot;omg why are you saying cheesy stuff like that&quot;) but once you realize that they are in show business, you stop feeling that it&#039;s stupid, realize it makes more sense than the rest of the series, and then might(like me) find the old style duels a little more boring(although I still love them)<br />
<br />
Alright, so first off, the story. Now, at the time of writing this, they have released 64 episodes, 63 of which I have seen(the 64th episode wasn&#039;t subbed when I had the chance to watch it). I really, really don&#039;t want to give the plot away, since that is half the fun, but a quick one sentence summary is: it starts off happy and kinda silly, with deeper plot points introduced early on, and as those plot points are revealed, the story progressively gets darker and edgier. Not too dark though-this series does a wonderful job of balancing the happy and darker episodes. It never really goes too far for you in either direction, and they never have either the dark or the happy/funny scenes come completely out of nowhere. Oh and when I said plot points are introduced early on-they hint at some things as early as episode 2, and most of the major plot points are hinted at by episode 20, although they aren&#039;t really elaborated on until about the 30&#039;s. <br />
<br />
If there were any flaws it might have to be that the story starts out a little slow. However, the story gains speed quickly, and when everything starts going down, it goes down fast. At some point you are like &quot;all this happened in 10 episodes??&quot; or &quot;wow things are a lot different now&quot;. But not different in a bad way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am a sucker for the stories which have a lot of plot introduced seemingly randomly, or introduce plot without you realizing it, and then piece it together for you and make you go &quot;oh! Wow! So that&#039;s why....&quot;. And this series does that well. You can tell that they had planned everything out from the beginning, and that really makes the story shine.<br />
<br />
Next we have the art. It&#039;s really good for Yugioh standards (especially the pendulum summons), but the currently running anime it&#039;s about average. So it gets a 7. Although the art and animation have places where they really since, you can sometimes pinpoint episodes where the art is of lesser quality(although it usually means they saved their budget for the next episode), and they have a few stock clips, like all yugioh series. Although they try their best to change up the stock clips(sometimes changing what characters are saying when they use an extra deck related summon).<br />
<br />
Sound. It got an 8 ‘cause even though it has a few tracks that are really catchy and I notice(especially the first opening and the 3rd ending theme), most of the time I don&#039;t notice the sound. Which is perfectly fine, since you don&#039;t and the sound to detract from the series, and I didn&#039;t notice any unfitting out background music I didn&#039;t like, it&#039;s just not too outstanding from most of the other anime I have watched. Still, that first opening is really, really catchy. So is some of the background music...<br />
<br />
Character gets a perfect 10 out of 10. Although there is one character hated by the fandom(Futoshi, the &quot;shivers&quot; kid), he ends up growing on you a little, gets pretty good character development, and has a great deck. Besides him, I have found all of the other characters to be really likeable, and most characters(even characters introduced for only an episode) get some kind of background and/or character development. What really made me happy though is that there are few one-time characters/enemies, and many of them come back to be important characters later, getting character development in the process. Of course, there are still a few one-time only characters, but they choose well. And I have got to admit, while I didn&#039;t necessarily like all of the one-time characters, they are all memorable. Which is good. And the main group gets so much character development, it&#039;s almost like season 3 of gx-but longer. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment is a perfect 10 out of 10. It drew me in from the start and keeps me wanting more. There were 2 nights I could hardly sleep I was so excited to watch the next episode. It has great rewatch value too- after you catch up, you can go back to watch from the beginning, and notice a lot of the subtle hints towards the overall direction of the plot.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you want to know how this compares to the other Yugioh anime(from what I have seen and heard about them), for me it goes:<br />
<br />
Arc V &gt; Gx/5ds &gt; Original &gt; Zexal<br />
<br />
GX was bad to start with, but got wayy better. It also kept characters and locations from the original series. The duel school thing was kinda stupid, but totally something Kaiba would do so...<br />
5ds started off really good(and the motorcycle thing was actually really cool and not overused), but ended up with the weaker seasons last. Also brought in Syncro summoning, and only mentioned fusion summoning once. And acted like the other characters never existed, except in the movie. Although all the characters would still be alive....Seemingly has no normal schools.<br />
Original was good, although the duels could get really long. Some of the characters were pretty unlikeable too.<br />
Zexal is okay, although the main character is pretty unlikeable. Same issues as far as 5ds goes with not bringing back characters or other summoning methods. Instead focuses only on XYZ summoning. Seemingly has no normal schools.<br />
<br />
Arc V: made duels a lot more interesting and entertaining( I thought it was stupid at first, but it entertainment duels are really entertaining. And not as stupid as they seem. Especially when you consider that dueling is entertainment anyway, so it actually makes more sense). They actually go to real school for the first time since the original series, and the &quot;duel school&quot; is really just a cram school/after school thing. Much more believable. They also bring back all the summoning methods, and a few characters from other series, and make them important. In fact, the characters brought back are more important in arc v than the brought back characters in GX(although that wasn&#039;t hard). Actually, arc v makes everything more believable....and they act more realistically too. For example, since they have &quot;real solid vision&quot; they can move around the field, so at one point they use the solid monsters to run away, and don&#039;t bother slowing themselves down with a duel. Also even when they do duel, when they get into a really dangerous situation, sometimes they try and run away. Which is what real people would do. And also what no one ever seemed to do in the other series.<br />

    This Reivew will contain no SPOILERS.<br />
English isn&#039;t my main language, but i will do my best to avoid any mistakes.<br />
note that this is my first review.<br />
so let&#039;s Start:<br />
When we Talk About Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V we will be talking about the fifth Season of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Series.<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story talks about Yuya Sakaki who wants to be an entertainment duelist just like his father after &quot;Action Duels&quot; Spreaded in the City.<br />
the story might be boring at the start of the anime but it will get updated and summoning methods from the previous series will be used and that&#039;s exactly what will make it fun to watch with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215752">
        some mysteries. i&#039;m Sure that alot of people dropped this anime because of its boring and aimless/childish story.<br />
i recomment everyone, Specially the people who liked Zexal and the previous seasons to watch this show to THE END. it really will shock you how the story will develop.<br />
Art: 9<br />
yup, it&#039;s great.<br />
Sound: 8<br />
The Soundtracks are really great! and they&#039;re making the duels more fun!<br />
the OP/ED&#039;s are good too.<br />
Characters: 7<br />
here, you will see alot of different characters. and of course you will like some and hate some. for me i didn&#039;t like the protagonist &quot;Yuya Sakaki&quot; and some guys from LDS like Sawatari Shingo but there are alot of other characters to like.<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
i Really Enjoy watching this show. as a real life duelist i really enjoy those duels!<br />
Overall: 9<br />
it&#039;s just great. at the start of the show i didn&#039;t really like it but i gave it a chance and kept watching instead of thinking that it&#039;s bad and childish. and i hope that everyone gives this a show a TRY.<br />
because it&#039;s not bad as it looks.<br />
and Finally, This is my personal opinion about this show.<br />
and in the end &quot;GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE&quot;

    I came into this series with low expectations. It was a down time for the Yugioh franchise. Coming off an excellent series from 5Ds to Zexal, it was terrible. Zexal almost completely ruined this franchise for me. I decided to give Arc-V a chance and I almost dropped it. It comes off as extremely kiddy and happiness and friendship everywhere, but you can&#039;t judge a series based on its looks. After starting off extremely slow, the series takes a 180 turn and becomes a suspenseful, action packed series. If you are willing to struggle through the first 10-20 episodes, you won&#039;t regret it.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
Arc-V has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review207414">
        one of the most compelling stories of any Yugioh franchise. It is almost better than the original and the first half of 5Ds. It brings back the sort of dark and emotional vibes that Duel Monsters and 5Ds gave, while also keeping a light heart feeling. Without spoiling much, if you watch this series, prepare for completely unexpected plot twist and a good, well written story.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
The OST is decent. The second and third opening are very good and the second ending is probably the best of any Yugioh series.<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
<br />
There are many loveable characters in this series. The protagonist Yuya, is different than all the protagonist of previous series. He is not an amazing duelist like Yusei, but he is not complete garbage like Zexal and he does not have to rely on some sort of spirit to be a better duelist. Yuzu, the main female protagonist is in my opinion, the only bad characters on the show. I do believe that she will become more important later in the series. Sora is a complete savage. He is the most ambiguous character in any of the Yugioh series, rivaling Bakura. You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re supposed to feel with him. Then finally there is the badass Kaiba-like character of Shun Kurosaki. He actually has good motives for why he duels. There are almost many other great characters such as Regi, Reira, Dennis, and not to mention two characters from a previous series make a return.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
This is a very enjoyable series to watch. There are amazing duels that take multiple episodes to do which helps give a Duel Monsters feelings. All the characters are almost equal in strength and Yuya doesn&#039;t have the &#039;Plot Armour&#039; that a lot of MCs have.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />

    Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V is the fifth installment in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, following Yu-Gi-Oh! ZeXal, and notably stands out to me as being the first time since GX Konami have actually done it right. This isn&#039;t a review of 5Ds or ZeXal, so I&#039;ll keep it brief, but I feel that unlike 5Ds, the characters are actually interesting and human, and unlike ZeXal, more than five of them actually stand out. Also, Arc-V has finally stopped with the hyper-promoting of new game mechanics. Yes, Pendulum summoning, which is very cool, is emphasised, but Synchros, Xyz and Fusion all make a return to the stage. Yes, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169737">
        a tool to sell more cards, but they&#039;re really catering to the anime fans this time around.<br />
<br />
Story: 7 - Now, the plot is in its infancy, but from what I&#039;ve seen of it, it&#039;s very interesting. There have already been a few twists at this early point, and I&#039;m enjoying the build-up to what I&#039;m guessing will be the final battle. There isn&#039;t much to comment on here, but the mystery of Yusho Sakaki&#039;s disappearance is definitely a nice hook for the series, and brings us in to view a cast who seem to be gettong embroiled in a battle without them even realising it. One gripe, however, is that it seems to be unravelling into a standard shonen battle plot, as opposed to the rollercoaster it looked like it would be earlier on.<br />
<br />
Art: 8 - The art in this series definitely upholds the standards set by ZeXal, as is to be expected for a show with the budget of Arc-V. The animation is almost seamless, transitioning between frames smoothly. The characters are well designed, I think, especially in the case of Yuya and Yuzu, with the characters emotions portrayed perfectly through their facial expressions and body language. This brings me onto another point, which is in the body language of characters. It&#039;s always drawn on point. Now, the art and animation aren&#039;t outstanding, but they are very good. They&#039;re exactly what I would expect from a Yu-Gi-Oh! series.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9 - I adore the duel sounds and the action music, they are absolutely perfect for building suspense and showing off a flashy move or something similar. Next up is the voice acting. Personally, I think Yuya&#039;s seiyuu is absolutely perfect for the role, the way his cry of &quot;ladies and gentlemen!&quot; rings out is entirely unforgettable, as well as the words &quot;tamashi no pendulum!&quot;, shouted every time he pendulum summons. Sora is another character whose seiyuu stood out to me: the way he talks is just indifferent enough to portray him, but he&#039;s certainly capable of the moments of excitement. The first OP and ED weren&#039;t really my thing, I&#039;d skip the OP more often than not, but the second OP is definitely worth sitting through every time, it&#039;s a wonderful piece of composition that fits well with the premise of the show.<br />
<br />
Character: 9 - This is where the show really stands out to me. Obviously, content is a lot more important than style, I mean, you can have the best art in the world but if you&#039;re content sucks you&#039;ve got a crappy anime. Compare and contrast with something like Kill la Kill, which has a sketchy art style and clunky animation, but a fantastic plot and wonderful characters. The characters in Arc-V are probably the best set of main and supporting characters I&#039;ve seen in a Yu-Gi-Oh! series. Let&#039;s start with Yuya, who is inherently flawed, obviously not the best duelist in the world, and hiding his sadness behind a mask. This is the kind of character archetype that appeals to me, and a lot of the tropes used are hard to pull off, and unlike with Yuma, it&#039;s done flawlessly. He&#039;s interesting, and has already gone through blue screens of death several times as a matter of course; his early character development is refreshing and entertaining. Then we have Yuzu, who is the supportive best friend, but her archetype goes much deeper than that. She starts off as kind of a mothering type, a Kotori 2.0, but she actually has more interesting flaws. Her character development, however, is top-notch, and has made her probably my favourite main character in the series bar Reiji. Now, in her character development this series loses having a strong female lead, but that can be forgiven because of the narrative necessity of Yuzu&#039;s development, and the fact that it led to her being such an interesting character. Then we have a character like Reiji, who looks like a hipster Kaiba, but is written so extraordinarily well it takes a hell of a long time before we know whether or not he&#039;s a good guy or a bad guy. Hell, right now I still have my doubts. Finally, Kurosaki Shun and Yuuto. They are both mysterious, and interesting, but Shun is definitely the one I prefer of the two. I won&#039;t say much to avoid spoiler, but he&#039;s finally the well-written pragmatic hero that Yu-Gi-Oh! series have been sorely lacking. All previous characters falling into this archetype haven&#039;t been written right, in my opinion, and I write a lot of pragmatic heroes. I get a lot more of an anti-hero vibe from several characters than I ever expected, and that&#039;s a damn good thing in my book. As far as rivalries go, Sawatari starts off as a jerk-ass and continues fulfilling that trope until character development hits him hard and fast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9 - So far, I haven&#039;t disliked an episode, and that&#039;s saying something, especially with the annoying Yuya cheer squad comprised of the one-dimensional children, the only character mistake made in this show. Every episode and every duel has served a narrative purpose, for once there have been no pointless filler duels, and for that I am glad and I give a 9 for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8 - Critically and objectively, I thing the fact that the plot is beginning to stagnate into something altogether predictable brings the series down somewhat, as well as the annoying cheer squad that just take up character space for no reason. However, this show is worth watching just for the characters, and even a cliched plot would be interesting with this character set. Hopefully, like ZeXal, we get a rip-roaring second season with a fantastic plot, but only time will tell. I still recommend a watch.

    AWESOME AGAIN, YUGIOH ANIME! *Mild basic unavoidable spoilers from ep1 below~<br />
We&#039;ve finally come out of the dark ages of Pokemon BestWishes and Yugioh Zexal (the latter of which they claim is pronounced &quot;Zearu&quot; but that&#039;s just BS)<br />
and here we are with great stuff like Pokemon XY&amp;Z and YUGIOH ARC V !!!(pronounced arc-five for some reason,but whatever,  it&#039;s great!)<br />
But we&#039;re talking about Yugioh Arc-V&#039;s amazing comeback, so let&#039;s go into depth!~~ I&#039;m only putting overall rating details for now-other stuff will come with the later show progression <br />
----<br />
Overall 9/10:<br />
I was one of the many fans that was about to drop the Yugioh anime series for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218556">
        good (and thus the new cards) thanks to the several-steps-down-from-epic-series that Zexal anime was, but Arc-V came out and I saw Yuya&#039;s design and thought &quot;hey look we got a yugioh protagonist who has good looking hair and a gravity-defying jacket again!&quot;<br />
 and then I also thought<br />
 &quot;Ok, I&#039;ll give ya one more chance Konami, but if this sucks too I&#039;m shaving myself bald and going to train as a Himalayan monk and forget about the material world&quot;  so then I endured about 20+ initial episodes on and off but Arc-V didn&#039;t strike me as anything special, in fact it only felt like a slightly better Zexal (being the same Studio Gallop). But then it started to show promise. Akaba Reiji (the &#039;Kaiba&#039; rival counterposition of Yuya) showed me that there were unusual things about the world of Arc-V, and other mysterious people who looked like Yuya started to appear and then it was LIke WHAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT REALITIES. Stuff like that. Point is, it started to get good, we cast off several characters that weren&#039;t gonna be important early on in the show and made for a new season (you know it&#039;s good when the third opening theme is just that awesome)<br />
and by season 3 of Arc-V, it was guranteed Arc-V was on the path to glory in both its merch sales and anime tv ratings!<br />
This is in a way Zexal done right. But it&#039;s injustice to compare to Zexal. Arc-V is up there in the high leagues with 5D&#039;s in performance and loveable characters (and SOME FAMILIAR CHARACTERS FOR OLDER FANS Yes but you have to watch past season 3 for that great fanservice explosion)<br />
<br />
Looking back, and reflecting on Yuya&#039;s &#039;smile&#039; which he uses to hide his weakness of being depressed all the time from his Father&#039;s disappearance, it&#039;s a pretty big step up in reality for Yugioh! series with characters! Or rather just a step back up to the high level playing field that I thought ended <br />
for good with 5D&#039;s series as the peak (not the dub crap, no one watches that)<br />
<br />
Very real ptsd if I say so myself; tho admittedly I can only appreciate it now that I&#039;ve gotten hooked back onto Yugioh series again. <br />
And there goes my wallet and all the money in it as I buy all those cards again....<br />
I&#039;ll update review again when the series airing is over (plz don&#039;t end)

    It&#039;s really hard on where to start for this review for the anime specifically.<br />
I&#039;ve had so many mixed feelings over the course of watching this anime. I literally started watching this series around episode 40 and have been following it ever since, and not gonna lie, it&#039;s become disappointing.<br />
<br />
What I will try to focus on in this review is more as a whole work rather than the current mess/chaos Arc-V is in. Because honestly, the 3rd and final arc is very upsetting to watch to say the least...<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s start off with one of my favorite aspects of the anime. CHARACTERS. (Let&#039;s pretend the last 30

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239700">
        episodes never happened to certain characters). From the beginning, Yuya Sakaki has been amazing and I&#039;ve loved his character development so much. he&#039;s come so far! I love all his counterparts as well. They all have such distinct personalities and the interactions between some of them are the BEST. It&#039;s one of the reasons I still hold onto this anime.  <br />
<br />
Annnd don&#039;t get me started on Yuzu! When I first started watching this series, I was so excited at the pivotal role Yuzu played in this anime, she had her own character development aside from Yuya and she had even her own storyline. She also had counterparts that were pretty amazing! Unfortunately, two of them are barely utilized as actual characters; they are literally just known as plot devices for a majority of the anime. <br />
<br />
 Unfortunately.... her character has greatly diminished since the Synchro Arc which is just very disappointing honestly. This anime sort of baits you into thinking that it breaks all the Yugioh tropes it&#039;s guilty of, but after 100 episodes (or even earlier for some), it starts turning into this clusterfuck that looks like the writers had no idea what to do and shoved random ideas around.<br />
<br />
It really upsets me how downhill this series has gotten. Its premise was very impressive with the four dimensions. I&#039;ve grown to love almost all the characters like Shun Kurosaki, Serena, so many others.<br />
<br />
But the past 5 episodes have been a HUUUGGEE letdown. and my patience for Arc-V is slowly diminishing but my love for Yuya is still going strong! Haha.<br />
<br />
The story was so good for the first 100 episodes!! But the pacing got really bad. I will admit the Synchro Arc could have been like 10 episodes less. The mini XYZ arc was atrocious in pacing and worldbuilding. It was so rushed and I barely connected with any Arc-V exclusive XYZ characters. A huge issue I think this anime is worldbuilding. It creates FOUR dimensions, but we only focus on mainly Standard and Synchro.<br />
<br />
I hate to sound like a huge criticizer of this anime, but I don&#039;t want to mislead you all. It&#039;s a wonderful show with wonderful characters that started off very strong but as you continue, the pacing becomes h o r r i  b l e. I had such high hopes for this anime but it disappointed me the moment the XYZ arc had begun. There were so many plot holes I could not forgive. <br />
<br />
But I honestly do wish you give this anime a try! You come up with so many headcanons and the character interactions are my favorite part. Beware of the legacy characters though. I feel like they took up waaay too much screentime to characters who were actually part of Arc-V. But please give this anime a try. I really do love the breakthrough of tropes in the first 60ish episodes. <br />
<br />
Animation can be a little wonky. You can tell some episodes had more effort just because of a plot point or a flashier duel.<br />
<br />
The music is also a beautiful touch! And I hope you enjoy how the dueling has evolved in this anime too. Yes there&#039;s a hippo but I think this is such a creative evolution of dueling! It&#039;s no longer just standing around and placing cards, it&#039;s being interactive with your environment and some of the stunts the characters pull in the duels is pretty awesome!

    Warning: This review is 100% biased, and since I&#039;m not a Yu-Gi-Oh player you may find my opinion completely irrelevant. <br />
<br />
You all want to know what I think of this anime? 3 words: HUGE. FUCKING. MESS. <br />
<br />
Holy crap, this anime had more inconsistencies than I could&#039;ve ever imagined, and that&#039; saying a lot since I tend to love clusterfucks. <br />
<br />
Storyline:<br />
<br />
I’m not even sure where to begin on this one because there are a lot of things that have gone wrong with the storyline. The main issue I have with this series is that it lies too much. The first couple of episodes lead up to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review225579">
        nothing the current episodes have evolved into. Looking back at it you’ll start to realize you’ve fallen into madness. <br />
<br />
In the beginning, the series has been set up with Yuya (the protagonist) who tries to follow his father’s footsteps and be an “entertainer Duelist”. He gets a lot of shit thrown at him because of his father’s disappearance, but we’ll talk about that later. Anyways, Yuya decides to duel against one of his dad’s haters or whatever. Yuya wins thanks to his magical pendant that turns his cards into “pendulum” cards; he gains recognition and fans including Tatsuya who sees Yuya as his role model. Storyline continues, then shit happens.<br />
The whole premise of the show seemed to revolve around Yuya finding his father while keeping his father’s legacy uphold with his own duelling. And, to also gain more students for Yuzu’s dad’s duelling school. Yuya’s got this magical pendant that turns his cards into “Pendulum” cards which is somehow NEVER explained as the series progressed. Seriously, at some point Yuya and Reiji go head to head with Pendulum summoning to see who’s superior or whatnot. Even that never got explained as to how Reiji managed to do this or how the origin of pendulum summoning began.  Also, with how Tatsuya stood out in the beginning despite the other two kids who were there. It felt like he was basically axed from the show. For someone who admired Yuya a lot, we never saw Tatsuya’s gameplays. What about developing his character? It was tragic actually. <br />
<br />
Then for some reason the writers of the show quickly decided that Yuya’s storyline was too asinine, so they decided to give Yuzu a magical bracelet as well. It basically acts like a metal boyfriend detector. Yuzu then meets Yuya 2.0, gets emo and then cries about how she doesn’t understand why this is happening to her (it’s alright Yuzu, I don’t even know what happened to the script after this). Fast forward later, Yuzu gets kidnapped, and Yuya and the gang try to save her. <br />
<br />
Basically the whole plot in the beginning gets thrown out all thanks to Yuzu’s bracelet. Forget, about Yuya’s magical pendant and him looking for his father, it’s all about Yuzu now. <br />
<br />
It doesn’t just stop there, they decided to add counterparts of Yuya and Yuzu so there’s like 8 main characters now? Oh yeah, GX decided to be one of the main antagonists this time. <br />
<br />
Nothing in this series makes sense anymore. Instead of Yuya trying to figure out the origins of Pendulum summoning, and finding his dad, he suddenly has to go fight a interdimensional war in order for Reiji’s dad to stop kidnapping little girls. All the characters they decided to introduce got pushed aside with characters we’ve already seen (aka Asuka from GX, Crow from 5D’s).  <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I’ve got no qualms with the art; it’s bright and colourful, and sometimes messy which suits the overall quality of the series.  <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I have to admit that ARC-V has one of the few anime openings I managed to bother listening to because they’re so darn catchy. And, typically I usually skip openings and ED’s just to save time. So, congratulations to that achievement ARC-V. <br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
<br />
I will applaud the ARC-V writers for finally trying to incorporate more characters other than their protagonist, Yuya. The downside to this? They had to minimize too much of his relevance in the series to balance him out with Yuzu. If they decided to cop out the characters, they should’ve just made Yuzu the main character from the start. At least it would’ve been consistent. <br />
I like Yuzu, I like Yuya. Unfortunately, the series didn’t know what they were doing with these characters. Add the other counterparts into the mix, and you get every fanfiction ever made.  It felt like AU’s were being pulled out from an invisible hat and crammed into an overflowing prose. Both Yuzu and Yuya had a beautiful relationship which would’ve developed even better if the writers didn’t decide to too many concepts in one.  <br />
<br />
Reiji has daddy issues. That is all. <br />
<br />
Tatsuya got ignored. I want justice for this. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
The issues that I had with this series weren’t the fact that they decided to give more screen time to a female character. The issues I had with it were that the writers decided to to take on more concepts than they could execute. The dimension travelling, missing parents, magical jewellery, counterparts + throwing in characters from previous generations, and you start to feel a bit overwhelmed.  <br />
Arguably saying, this could be said about all the other generations such GX, 5D’s, and Zexal. And, you’re probably right. But, for so many people claiming that the writing has improved and that ARC-V is the best that’s happened so far isn’t impressive in the least. <br />
<br />
I really wanted to love this anime, I love the characters, I liked the soundtrack and animation. The only thing I didn’t like was how the storytelling was being handled. I didn’t feel like ARC-V was being its own show. The whole dimension travelling/counterparts was the water that broke the camel’s back for me. I don’t have issues with crossovers, but if they were going to do that they should’ve just went the same route as “Bonds Beyond Time”. Not dedicate an entire anime series for it. It just felt like a last minute cop out in hopes of making decreasing sales skyrocket again. <br />
If ARC-V did manage to increase its sales revenue then that’s great, they got what they wanted. However, I’m thoroughly disappointed that it had to come to this. I was hoping to become immersed to the game itself and buy a Yu-Gi-Oh deck of my own just like I did with Vanguard. And, for the most part ARC-V did tempt me in the beginning of the anime to do so, but my feelings have diminished since then. <br />
<br />
Am I being too harsh with this series? The answer is yes, it’s not like the previous Yu-Gi-OH animes didn’t have its own set of flaws that are similar to ARC-V. The only difference is that ARC-V was the only series I managed to become so invested in that it nearly convinced me to buy a trial deck of my own. So, I’m harsh within reason that it didn’t live up to the expectations I had for it or as others hyped it up to be. This is the first Yu-Gi-Oh series I’ve ever dropped.  The series hasn’t ended yet, so if they managed to fix these plot holes I may change my mind. <br />

    Story - 6<br />
<br />
I really want to like this anime more than I do. It&#039;s probably dumb to have any kind of expectations for a show created to sell merchandise to children beyond painfully mediocre, but what the show had managed to capture in the first few dozens of episodes got my hopes up. <br />
<br />
What seems like the typical shounen fare of a main character wanting to be the best (in Sakaki Yuya&#039;s case, the best duelist and entertainer like his father) is interrupted by events seemingly incompatible with his dreams. The show manages to capture the feeling that there&#039;s something sinister and mysterious lurking in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216402">
        the background, and that Yuya and company are caught up in something much, much larger than themselves that could very easily squash them. That kind of vibe is more than I expected from a show like this. <br />
<br />
However, as soon as the show passes the episode 50 mark into its second major arc, what seems like the characters finally taking the first leap to engage that looming threat turns out to be a meandering experience. A lot of the events feel like padding or unnecessarily drawn out. Even though the main cast formally organized as a team, they hardly spend much time actually being shown working as one (and much of that teamwork is towards the very end) compared to the time spent on them being isolated from each other or dealing with other secondary characters. It&#039;s underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Another criticism I would have is that some instances that cause drama only seem to happen because of a failure to rationally communicate, creating situations that feel somewhat contrived. I wouldn&#039;t call this that big of a problem though, since there are also occasions where the characters act rationally to try to solve a problem.<br />
<br />
A few times, how events play out feels unsatisfying compared to their build up, or are executed in a frankly kind of boring way that turns out to be a tease. It kind of feels like previous series were better able to achieve satisfaction or catharsis with their larger events.  This problem is more prevalent in the 2nd half of the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
<br />
Speaking very broadly, the show&#039;s story still maintains some interest and mystery. Even as the overall quality seems to dip, there are still some good moments and duels.<br />
<br />
Characters - 6<br />
<br />
Some of the main cast so far are underutilized or fall short of their potential. The show has a large cast to juggle, so some falling to the wayside is probably expected. Many of them have genuinely well defined personalities that bounce off each other well when they interact. The problem is that there&#039;s not a lot of that interaction between the contrasting personalities of Yuya and co. <br />
<br />
A few secondary characters can come off as annoying or irritating to some. However, there are also secondary characters that are entertaining but don&#039;t overstay their welcome and gracefully exit the show when their role is over. It can be a mixed bag when it comes to less important or one-off characters.<br />
<br />
The rivalry between Reiji and Yuya also seems like lost potential. They&#039;re both similar in having unsorted issues dealing with their fathers and a desire to protect their home, but go about how they deal with their personal problems in starkly different ways (Reiji making sure to maintain his stoicism and a distance from others, while Yuya is more emotionally driven). I think this could have been given a little bit more attention than what it had gotten.<br />
<br />
Yuya as a main character is okay. At times I do feel sympathetic to what he wants to achieve (ultimately getting the bad guys to stop using card games to hurt others), but other times I feel as if they&#039;re making him explicitly state his motivations a little too often, almost to the point of becoming a parody of itself. Subtlety is probably not the biggest priority in a show like this, but they manage to be more subdued with other characters in not directly stating multiple times what they&#039;re all about and what they live for. There&#039;s somewhat more depth to his character than what I&#039;ve written here, but I can&#039;t judge him in full until the show finishes. In the 2nd year of the show his development as a character seems to waffle for the sake of it, but I chalk that up to the padding issues present throughout.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
<br />
Soundtrack is great, and a few tracks are pretty memorable. Don&#039;t have any complaints.<br />
<br />
Art - 5<br />
<br />
Overall, the character designs service the characters&#039; personalities well. The monster designs are probably not something to rave about, but there are some nicely designed monsters here and there. However, where it suffers is in the animation. 2-3 episodes out of a dozen will look good (even great), but there will be some egregiously stilted or poorly drawn animation in others, to the point where it&#039;s a little distracting. I&#039;m not rating the animation next to a gold standard, but it is slightly disheartening after the previous series managed much better consistency in the animation department. The animation problems probably have to do with Studio Gallop having to juggle the productions of a weekly show and the upcoming DM movie at the same time.<br />
<br />
All of this is of course subject to change as the show starts to enter its last(?) year of its run. I don&#039;t imagine my opinion is the popular one, and I think it&#039;s great that a Yugioh series can still invest people in its story. I&#039;m just not as enthusiastic about the show as I was, or hoped to have been.

    Coming back with the all-new Pendulum monsters and a plot line, Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V is the newest anime series featuring the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game. Much like ZEXAL, this follows a kid named Yuya who strives to be the best duelist in a SoL/Comedy/Adventure setting. Though difficulties and obstacles persist, let&#039;s see what makes Arc-V an anime that resonates in Yu-Gi-Oh! fans new and old. [Warning: Minor Spoilers]<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s quite a clichéd story as Yuya and his friends strive to be the best at a tournament by proving themselves as the best through duels. Then we have the villains who are basically soon-to-be-friends as well as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182320">
        ZEXAL elements in the story. But the plot soons turn into an inter-dimensional war as all the summoning types engage in battle. Honestly, this is just amazing as it somehow sums up the prior 4 into one series.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
The character and scenery designs are alright, but Arc-V really shows their true arts during the duels. The Action Field that always changes brings a new scenery into play every time as well as the monsters, spells, traps, etc. Their designs are much more child-like, but do not lose the element of action and thrill. The art here in Arc-V is most superior during the suspenseful duels between duelists.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
The openings and endings are pretty cool. I especially like the 2nd one. Other than that, background music during duels does set the atmosphere and vibe and it makes it explicit enough for us to know what&#039;s happening.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
This time around, we have a pretty big cast of people that each have their own story as well as their own archetype that correponds to their character. This makes them have their own unique flair and makes them shine whenever they duel. Their monsters reflects themselves. Of course, though some shine more than others, I feel that the spotlight on people like Yuya, Sora, Kurosaki, and others makes the story all the more interesting. Still, I&#039;d like for them to focus on others too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
Whenever Arc-V comes on, I always get excited for an intense duel of emotions, feelings, and even better, new monsters! As an avid duelist myself, seeing my cards come alive makes me excited! (since we do not have the technology to make the cards come alive.) It&#039;s always nice to reminiscence about the old series as before this, there was only 1 summoning method. But Arc-V has them all from Fusion to Xyz so the excitement never dies down.<br />
<br />
Arc-V is truly an enjoyable anime for me. Despite being a kid&#039;s show, the exciting duels and dynamic plot makes it all the more interesting for me to watch. I recommend this people who want to get into the Yu-Gi=Oh! fandom as it teaches you A LOT about the game, as well as those who want to see a card game in action, because in Arc-V it&#039;s always time to d-d-d-d-d-d-duel!
