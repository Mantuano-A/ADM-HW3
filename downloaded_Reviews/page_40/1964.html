    Look I think I understand what is wrong with the people giving bad reviews to this brilliant anime, they are being too..Kantian...let me explain.<br />
I am not a big anime fan in general, yet I grew up watching and reading Dragon Ball and let me tell you a secret I believe we all should keep in mind: the beauty of Dragon Ball is its diversity of registry, ranging between comedy, romance, horror, drama...and whatever else you may think of.<br />
Each character in Dragon Ball is endowed with affinity towards a specific element...BUT each character also has some room to expand and switch between his less dominant traits.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213058">
        Even Yajirobē had its dramatic moments, and Piccolo had its comedic ones. <br />
The same is true for the whole chapters, yes Dragon Ball Z has a more mature and dramatic tone than the original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT is surely much more of a commercial product which targets younger audiences...BUT these are all generalizations and they can only grasp a portion of what each of the chapter actually amounts to.<br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super is a fresh, inspired look into Goku&#039;s world, offering beautiful artworks and some brilliant story-telling, the right combination of comedy relief and thundering action. The comic scenes with King Kai at the beginning are just the treat, Beerus and Whis turn out to be absolute comic geniuses on par with mythological Master Roshi in the original Dragon Ball or Old Kai in Dragon Ball Z. The battle sequences between Goku and Beerus in deep space are unprecedented and IMO they set a milestone for the whole saga in awesomeness.<br />
I think that much a better work could and should have been done with the characters of Gohan, Chichi, Krilin, Goten, Trunks, Piccolo&amp;Co, it seems that Beerus, Whis, Goku&amp;Vegeta, Bulma got a first-class script while the rest of the family is stuck with cliché and predictable/boring dialogue. <br />
About Vegeta, I think he has the potential to become the most loved character in the series, he is smart, strong, has great timing in its lines and he is (almost) always at the right place at the right time story-wise. <br />
I cannot but highly recommend this Dragon Ball Super who stole my heart and brought me back almost 20 years* and wish you to have as much fun as I had!<br />
<br />
*I hope Jaco is not reading me;)<br />

    hello Everyone! This is my first review here so I&#039;ll try my best on reviewing this show thus far through my viewing. <br />
<br />
This will be quite a surprise for me to say this but I am actually enjoying this series more than I thought. I know right? Since its A first I need to come out and state why I&#039;m enjoying it. You see it has been a LONG time since we heard there was going to be a new series for the Dragonball Franchise after all, It is a major household name in anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d advise anyone who are thinking of watching Dragonball Super to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195463">
        have at the very least watch the previous seasons Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball kai or just reading the manga otherwise you won&#039;t understand much of what is going on thus far if you have not so just thought I should let you know.<br />
<br />
Now this might sound weird and completely off to some people out there but I actually prefer this series more for its build up and its variety of content with each episode that feels like it is a genuine continuation, YES I know! So far its just a lesser quality rehash of the 2 movies of battle of gods and Revival of F but from a series standpoint its still at the same time its an interesting continuation of the manga of what its setting up for and I&#039;ll gladly say so even if others are put off by it.<br />
<br />
So far in comparison to the first Dragonball, Z and GT whether you are considering comparing them or not, I feel that this gets in a nice stride of fun with that nice sense of comedy relief with its characters in its continuation which in foremost is great to see that it still retains that Akira Toriyama spirit in his depiction which is why I fell in love with the franchise in the first place and I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t decide to bring out some random black star dragonballs out of nowhere which was stupidly added in GT which I didn&#039;t like (though I did like his art design for some of the characters in GT) Problem was he wasn&#039;t handling the story especially when the story thought it was a good idea to turn Goku into a child throughout the whole ordeal which I found extremely pointless.<br />
<br />
So I&#039;m glad seeing that in this series so far, characters like Goku, Vegeta and many of the others made me feel like I&#039;m watching a proper continuation FINALLY in terms of its setting and surroundings with these certain memorable moments that have happened in the arcs so far. <br />
<br />
Beerus definitely feels a little more antagonizing than he was in battle of gods which the show strides to show more and more as it goes along. seen as I watched the film I also noticed some differences with the story in comparison to the movie which is thankfully good in terms elaborating on certain key points in term flushes out more content that will seem to show other alternative points within each episodes that is coming out so far and that alone is evident and exciting also. <br />
<br />
Finally the art has had an UPGRADE!! about damn time despite the fact Toei Animation studios lack consistency now and then.<br />
its nothing as dynamic and obviously won&#039;t be to that movie quality but it still feels very refreshing to see something not dated for dragonball in 2015 which is nice. <br />
<br />
The opening is brilliant too with good animations and hints to where the journey is bound to take the viewers along in their stride of the story with the showcase of new characters and the music is really good and doesn&#039;t feel repetitive at all. In fact I&#039;m watching the episodes with the opening so far which goes to show how good the song is.<br />
<br />
The ending if you have seen the previous series also has nice touching memories of nostalgia which the ending songs complements it nicely. <br />
<br />
My real main issue of the show so far is that the story seems to get a bit too quirky and extensive at times which is my main gripe with this show mainly. but so far its getting into build up and also giving way for the fights that will take place in its simplistic approach at this very moment which feels easy for me to sit through and just enjoy the fun.<br />
<br />
Now do not go into this with high expectation just because its Dragonball, otherwise it won&#039;t be to your liking, after all its an 80s anime in its continuation of the modern day that still retains those very aspects of what made this franchise stand tall for so long now from back then, Of course its not for everyone If others are not willing to tolerate this show for what it is than do not bother anyway.<br />
<br />
Also try thinking of watching this as just another fun, simple and yet silly shounen appetizer after the big main course, that being the previous seasons of the Dragonball franchise. So far I&#039;m enjoying the moment.<br />
<br />
There could be many new stuff to come along the way so who knows..<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading and have a great day wherever you are ;)

    I&#039;m here to give my review from an objective standpoint of a fan who has seen and read Toriyama&#039;s work.<br />
<br />
Story - 6<br />
Its pretty basic, the story is a continuation after the Majin Buu arc that takes place sometime after some time (Its not yet specific as to when in this series) <br />
however It doesn&#039;t mean its right at the end of Dragon ball Z like some people by accident think, but it does somewhat takes place in between the 2 since there was a 10 year time gap after the majin buu saga and before UuB is even introduce into the story. questionable I know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195981">
        but writer Akira Toriyama along with Toyotarō who handles the manga adaptation for Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ anime and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ Special One Shot. <br />
<br />
Toyotarō is also the official artist of the manga version of Dragon Ball Super and toriyama&#039;s staff can usually have certain weaknesses when it comes to consistency and handling such a big franchise then again it has those inconsistencies within the story towards whatever comes and goes in and outside the franchise.<br />
<br />
Now I can understand if the confusion for some people as well as fans, well that is if you were paying attention with the story of battle of gods which mostly aren&#039;t in some people&#039;s cases here and to point out with what the movie was showing was an indication from Toriyama&#039;s setting placing these films as parts of the dragon ball super series. <br />
YES toriyama is putting the same storyline from the latest movies but that is not the entire focus of dragon ball Super neither is Frieza&#039;s Revival of F we get it everyone in the universe has seen it. <br />
<br />
Yes it does include rehashing the 2 movies which is a bad drawback here in terms of fans expectation as well as the fact that these movies are still very recent and I get it, Its not acceptable for starting this new series off towards but I still liked to see them to do certain tweaks with its story in regards to the movies, But the main question I guess is Do they do it and does it make that much of a difference? <br />
<br />
This is a mix bag while yes they have made a few certain alterations in some nice ways in the episodes but in terms if it really made that much of a difference? Than If I&#039;m being honest it really at the same time doesn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t to say its a discouraging thing though, Instead this certain continuation in a way I believe hold these ideas as part of something big to happen for later on. <br />
<br />
In the manga and interviews toriyama has referenced a new UNIVERSE 6 with there being 12 universes mentioned as part of it lore in that shares these 2 movies as part of a long series and I&#039;ve seen some of the episode listing and its as how these reviewers try describing to you saying that &#039;&#039;OH CRAP THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS THE 2 MOVIES WITH FILLER&#039;&#039; (yes because the author is getting the members of the same staff from GT working on this who wasn&#039;t satisfied with GT wants to do another. WOW well done Einstein but your wrong as this is cannon so you can bow out.)<br />
<br />
Some have laughably mentioned that these 2 movies take up 100 episodes as most of the majority which is false considering the last point of battle of gods in super is actually within the 12 episodes after the first 2 episode. &#039;&#039;WHAT!? WHY DO I HAVE TO SEE THAT FOR 14 EPISODES?<br />
<br />
Easy answer, FOR THE NEW INTRODUCTION OF CONTENT THAT CONTINUES IN THE SERIES AND FURTHER ON DUH, The same goes for revival of F as they are also giving way for certain added features in the mean time on top of this long story, the real question is are you willing to tread far with what ever new content starts going into this series?? <br />
<br />
If so, STOP BITCHING ABOUT THE FIRST 5 EPISODES BEING SHIT IF YOU DON&#039;T ACTUALLY CARE WHERE THE STORY IS GOING,<br />
IF SO YOU DON&#039;T HAVE TO READ ANY FURTHER. After All I intend to give an objective review, which doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m praising it, let alone Bashing it. <br />
<br />
If you do have a question that you need to address me with you can do so if you not sure on what I&#039;m stating in my review.<br />
<br />
If after the review you are feeling annoyed about my score you can just skip it if you think I&#039;m just wasting Your time. Got it?.<br />
<br />
Continuing on, The story in its continuation has an interesting layout so far and I can say I like how the story is expanding on with its new content however there are a lot of inconsistencies so far which seems pretty obvious. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t trying to recapture a complete essence of nostalgia but mostly its trying to stay closer to toriyama&#039;s light hearted and comedic themes with its continuation in a proper manner where the time skip has happen after the events of majin buu onwards and this would be through the characters we know already of since the start such as Goku as well as the other characters old and new and even those that are strangely in between playing somewhat of a role into this.<br />
<br />
Beerus who is a major threat to goku and others recalls a dream to his assistant whis where he predicts that he will face against the super saiyan god. knowing that there is a connection to the saiyan race as well how beerus says about him ordering frieza to depose of the race as he did not like King vegeta now to me it diminishes frieza&#039;s character as a villain but can be argued that it makes beerus that more antagonizing and possibly a threat in a lot of ways.<br />
<br />
By the 4th episode we see the supporting characters such as krillin, 18, Tien, yamcha and others play out in the very segment that happens in the movie but in a different location, that doesn&#039;t mean to say things change much because for the most part it still showcases a lot of slapstick sillyness which really at times isn&#039;t my fancy. <br />
<br />
As goku trains, king kai is aware of the incoming threat that heads to his planet being beerus and whis as they head to confront the last remaining saiyans about the super saiyan god in the hopes of a duel. however these are just the beginning of these episodes. Where we really move from the movies we go into new territory that brings the fans more attention to what has been pretty much setting up for the story. which honestly is a long while but where you want to see new content and not the movies Episode 28 will be that point of interest for those interested.<br />
<br />
Characters - 7<br />
Now despite the fact there really hasn&#039;t been too much progression with lots of these characters. For me to go through each of them for analysis is personally too long individually all at once though lets be honest,<br />
You wouldn&#039;t watch this series in the first place if you haven&#039;t seen the previous seasons or read the dragonball manga but lets get something straight here. <br />
<br />
From the very 1st episode, A time of peace has happened as usual from the theme that begins in most dragon ball settings during timeskips. <br />
<br />
Goku now alive at this point from the other world is pretty much unsatisfied with his earthly lifestyle which is funny since this is the real first significance in the series where goku is actually working as a family man along with goten, yes gohan and videl we know are easily together at this point as well being that its 6 months later after the events of the Buu arc. <br />
<br />
Hercule is still regarded as the planet saviour from the public. feeling grateful he gives the prize money to goku and his family which I thought was fair since goku was the true warrior that save the world from the threat of buu.<br />
<br />
From there goku continues to train with King Kai, Meanwhile goku&#039;s rival vegeta is more in tune with his family despite feeling uncomfortable with living a regular family lifestyle with trunks and bulma. Vegeta has come to recognise from the time he fought buu he has changed to feeling more of a connection to his family as well as having the same smug exterior and also still even more determined to surpass goku.<br />
<br />
Beerus and Whis who we got to know from battle of gods are extremely powerful beings that are roaming across the galaxy as they see fit. <br />
Beerus being the most chaotic of the 2 destroys multiple planets and civilisations whenever he is not in a good mood or doesn&#039;t like the food which at times will feel a lot more silly but at the same time enjoyable to watch for these 2 characters in terms of those comedic moments.<br />
<br />
Beerus for me, is the stand out character of the show so far. <br />
I love BEERUS-SAMA!<br />
<br />
The way the writers have build him up so far has been very good in terms of a new big threat within the overall world of the franchise and a unique individual among the cast in general which for me is a smart entertaining addition to the story so far.<br />
<br />
Again there is a lot that could happen from now with the characters, that can change from here on so we&#039;ll see a lot more of the other characters in depth later on. <br />
<br />
The real bad of this story has been a lot of its writing inconsistencies at along with its characterisation at times which has been a major gripe I&#039;ve been having with the show so far. Though Its writing in the franchise in general hasn&#039;t really always shown those thoughtful consistency it still at the very least caters to trying to being entertaining in other ways that it conveys in its mood of the characters in general. <br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t regard to being picky to a certain demographic nor does it try to steer away from its traditional fun that it places its content with the story since it knows its own entertaining aspects of its genre lies towards in and is for the most part very casual in its very approach in that sense. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation - 6<br />
I can agree with most of the reviewers here that episode 5 art was god awful which got a lot more strange with the thick outlines that was present throughout episode 4 which tells me that Toei Animations that have handled a lot of series with long amount of episodes will usually find it very tough to keep the work rate consistent which is a real shame since its been a long time that dragonball fans would get the chance to watch a new dragonball anime that has a difference in art and animation and its sad that early on as this. <br />
The first 3 episodes to me are still decent and not that bad at all And I feel unlike certain others that its dreadful throughout like a lot want you to believe. <br />
<br />
But it also doesn&#039;t excuse A rich company like Toei Animation at times have this ongoing reputation of poor handling of art and animations in series such as One Piece, World Trigger, Digimon, Toriko, Sailor Moon, Yu-Gi-Oh along with SO many others that toei I feel are mainly damaging their own reputation because these are some major household names that they have the rights to the handling of the art and animation in the process. <br />
<br />
I simply cannot ignore that they are being quite disrespectful to the shows including most of all Dragonball Super and its fans in terms of their service. Dragonball as a franchise has been one of their biggest profits. I mean just look at how well Battle of Gods and Revival of F did here in the west. <br />
(Which I know already some are mixed on it anyways)<br />
<br />
To me its just odd for a studio that has had great earnings and yet are making this show with inconsistent art and animations in the way it has been for episodes 4 and 5, Though recently it has been handled carefully as of late.<br />
<br />
Its Easily not a favourable studio amongst the fans which is obvious, They seemed to have less acknowledgement in what they are doing which I don&#039;t believe that to be the characters or the writing what so ever but the animators and designers behind the way certain episodes are handled which is unfortunate and yet Toei have also been known to up the quality when it is needed like they did when they showed off the transformation of SSJ3 Goku but then they didn&#039;t keep up with its consistency which makes this section a mixed bag here. then again that possibly could alter or change sometimes.<br />
<br />
Hell even creator toriyama, TORIYAMA!! of all people was unhappy with the state of its animation and came out about his feelings on it, so you know this is already an issue.<br />
<br />
However the Visual have started to make a much better improvement now and now I absolutely applaud them for that even at times the art might look a little wonky it is becoming a lot more handled with better care than that of episode 5 at this point.<br />
<br />
Sound - 6<br />
Apart from some of the characters that sound off in their performance other voice actors such Ryo Horikawa as Vegeta, Kouichi Yamadera as Beerus and Tien, Tsuru Hiromi as Bulma, Morita Masakazu as Whis along with most of the cast sound fine as their respective characters however I don&#039;t like the voice actress for goku even though she is notably great in other roles, Jouji Yanami as King Kai I feel he should stick to being the narrator as his performance is showing a rather abysmal display, And I mean no disrespect when saying this.<br />
<br />
The music is can be good at times but then other times it can also be a underwhelming which is lacks that overall feel to some certain scenes.<br />
<br />
This goes without saying but I love The Dragonball Super&#039;s opening theme!!! <br />
The song is very easy on the ear to listen to and not so overblown out of proportion that it feels like another show entirely and It goes well with the art and animation. .<br />
<br />
Good morning America also has a nice light hearted beat for its ending as it serves to bring more of a simple and fun movement at its core. <br />
Sumitomo has done a few tracks in the series for specific scenes I like so far but not all his soundtracks really hit it out of the park in the way I would of liked it but that might be just down to my own personal taste I guess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 7<br />
Unlike most of the hate and negative thoughtless reviews this show is ridiculously getting in the space of 5 episodes and so on. I have found the story while having the movies displaying within this series still to be quite reliable with its continuation as a natural viewer I&#039;ve appreciate some of its episodes so far but its still got ways to carry on from here in terms of that necessary quality of recent animes of this present day and as a fan, It is still pretty exciting and enjoyable without the fact of me feeling that much neglect on what the previous series stood for in terms of its own brand of entertainment. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d for one say foremost that this is a okay continuation after Z even if you disagree, Compared to other reviewers I do have great knowledge on this series and I can tell where it delivers so for those looking to write the most negative review about this show are only serving to make other feel negative where I have addressed this in a more constructive fairer manner than these other jokers that can&#039;t barely write a review let alone an insult that anyone probably would have heard so many times over by now.<br />
<br />
Overall - 6<br />
I suggest sticking to the manga as well as the anime if you just want to see where toriyama is going at times with the story. And yes I know the manga is monthly and the anime is weekly which btw the anime is ahead at this moment of time.<br />
<br />
But you still should check out the difference in between though the anime will at times will easily overtake the manga itself which can effect the state of any writers of A story that will have many fans constantly debating what they want all the time which will be at times a real big chore of trying satisfy those out there and toriyama has been known to have those inconsistencies a lot of times of trying to always keep trying to meet fans expectations despite this and other ambitions.<br />
<br />
Now and then I feel how passionate and fun the story wants to stay no matter how others will perceive it to be.<br />
<br />
Its also a driving force that we even got a new dragonball series and now viewers around at times even after getting a new series is just bitch and moan when something never goes there way which by the way we all can be guilty of this among any written fiction no matter what, so it shouldn&#039;t come as a surprise in the way people behave about this franchise (Not saying you can&#039;t be critical but at the same time should never over analyse to the point knowing what the series represents as to what it had always started out as a <br />
simple, fun, battle shonen in the first place) so deal with it. <br />
<br />
The main thing is to have fun with the franchise in general, without going off the deep end of it.<br />
<br />
As a fan I&#039;ve been able to watch the previous series prior to this one which I enjoy still especially since its art/animation was very much ahead of its time from long ago but if you still want to hear more negativity and very blind insights around you because of someones over analysis of it then go right ahead because I for one, don&#039;t have any shame of watching Dragon ball super so far and you shouldn&#039;t either, After all everyone has different taste as well as mine of just being a dragon ball fan and I&#039;m proud of that.<br />
<br />
Continuing the Journey now. Later. <br />
Feel free to ask me any questions about dragon ball super or <br />
my just review in general.

    Dragon Ball is and probably always will be my favorite series. I was just an four year old boy when I first had the pleasure of witnessing Dragon Ball on TV. Though I was perhaps too young to understand it, as I got older, I&#039;d eventually move onto Dragon Ball Z. The more I&#039;d aged, the more I grew to love Dragon Ball. I was hooked, and my knowledge of the series was immense. <br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super is the continuation and sequel of Dragon Ball Z. The story is quite similar to Z as we see our hero Goku progressively meeting stronger foes and the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274913">
        stakes becoming higher. New elements and characters are introduced such as the Gods. Something that Super has incorporated in this show that sets it apart from Z is character development. The series is also able to incorporate effective drama and genuinely hilarious comedy into its story, the most noteworthy being the action and pure fighting that is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z.<br />
<br />
Now there are a few problems with it right at the start. The first two arcs were basically retelling the movies Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. While the animation can occasionally dip into the inexcusable category (I&#039;m looking at you, episode 5 and over half of Golden Frieza arc), the show is never able to dissuade you from watching it due to the action and nostalgia. However, after those two arcs, the animation gets noticeably better. The OSTs and intros are also very nostalgic. But at the end of the day, it is just more Dragon Ball Z.  I think it is simply nostalgia surrounding the dragon ball franchise for me that makes you just can&#039;t help but want to watch it and enjoy it. I think we can all agree the writing is very bad but the action is absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
If you grew up with Dragon Ball or have watched Dragon Ball Z as a kid or early teens, then you will probably enjoy this series!

    I can definitely say that this is the worst anime I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
-The characters were all (yes, ALL OF THEM) flanderized;<br />
<br />
-The story is stupid as hell.<br />
<br />
-There are no developments<br />
<br />
-The are no connections between the sagas. If you exclude ANY of them, it will doens&#039;t change anything;<br />
<br />
-The anime tries tu use fanservice every singles time, but they doesn&#039;t make any sense. They grew up Trunks&#039; hair only to show the &quot;Super Trunks&quot; transfomation with the exactly same design as before (when he actually had a long hair);<br />
<br />
-Goku and Vegeta are not heroes anymore. They&#039;ve never protected the universe, never won a villain;<br />
<br />
-There&#039;s no tension, no sense

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244583">
        of danger. Jokes are present all the time, even in the middle of the battles or DEATHS;<br />
<br />
-Trunks and Freeza&#039;s return is completely pointless. It just ruined the characters (since Trunks became a big crying baby, with 30+ years old but with the same appearance as 17 (again, non-sense fanservice));<br />
<br />
-The villains there&#039;s no motivation. They&#039;ve tried to make something complex with Goku Black/Zamasu, but they abandoned it in the middle of the saga;<br />
<br />
-The powerscale went to hell. Nothing makes sense. Goku Black Pink form is strongest than Goku Blue, which is strongest than any other transformation, but Trunks ssj2 can still beat the enemy;<br />
<br />
-It&#039;s the only DB production which used the &quot;friendship power&quot; as a horrible deus ex-machina;<br />
<br />
-Goku became an idiot, he can&#039;t even recognize ki anymore. Vegeta dances for Bills and became a tsundere. Future Trunks became a crying babe, he doesn&#039;t know how to do anything by himself. Goten e Trunks are 14 years old, but they look younger than Z (with 7). Gohan became the weakest guy of the show, never won one battle;<br />
<br />
-The battles are fast, censored, you can&#039;t feel the punches, there&#039;s no impact;<br />
<br />
-The animation is horrible. I think only Berserk 2016 can be worse;<br />
<br />
-The direction is completely terrible. Nothing is in the right place. You can&#039;t even recognize if it&#039;s a serious scene or if it&#039;s a joke. The use of the BGMs is pathetc. The angles of the camera, very poor. There&#039;s no sense of storytelling. Nothing.

    So, Dragon Ball Super. A series widely criticized and panned from the beginning, due to a multitude of things. Retelling the past 2 movies, poor animation quality, etc. But as you can see by my score, I actually really like this show! Is it perfect? No, just look at some of those first 27 episodes, and you can really see a struggle to get episodes out.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a review of episodes 28-89, it&#039;s a review from episode 1. I&#039;ll be reviewing each arc separately, before wrapping it all up with my overall thoughts. <br />
<br />
           

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247588">
              -Battle of Gods-<br />
The animation overall during this arc is, in my opinion..pretty good. It tries to imitate the cleaner art style of the movie, and I think it succeeds, for the most part. Minus the extreme mess that was the original airing of episode 5. The story is pretty much just a retelling of the movie, stretched out into 13/14 episodes. Some of the fight scenes are now longer, some filler scenes have been added, or new perspectives. It&#039;s pretty minor stuff, not a whole lot to change my mind about the movie. If you want the &quot;definitive&quot; Battle of Gods experience, I recommend watching the movie, but also watch some of the new scenes, and that last fight can be swapped out for the TV version.<br />
<br />
                  -Resurrection &#039;F&#039;-<br />
Look. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of the original movie, and sadly this arc does little-to-nothing to improve upon the original material. Time restrictions and tight schedules led to poor animation, and it really shows in some of the later episodes. There&#039;s this odd addition of Captain Ginyu that just happens at one point, for around 5 minutes, but that&#039;s really all of note. I&#039;d say skip this arc, just watch the movie. Or don&#039;t watch the movie, and read the manga. It&#039;s up to you.<br />
<br />
                  -Universe 6-<br />
Yes! The first real original content to come from Super...and it&#039;s a tournament arc. Okay, I know people like tournament arcs, whether it be My Hero Academia or Hunter x Hunter, and fans of the original Dragon Ball probably appreciate them doing a tournament arc. To me, however, that&#039;s one of the issues of this arc: it&#039;s just a tournament. There aren&#039;t really any stakes, no universe-destroying threat, it&#039;s a fight compilation. And while the fights are pretty good (Hit vs Goku for example), and the arc certainly sets up later stories as well as introducing some new and unique characters, there&#039;s not much else. If you just want some good fights, then yeah, I can recommend this arc. If you want a tournament with stakes..I&#039;ll save that for later.<br />
<br />
                  -Future Trunks/Goku Black-<br />
As a fan of Future Trunks, you can bet I was excited when I heard that he&#039;d be in the &quot;newest arc of Dragon Ball Super&quot;. Any excuse to give Eric Vale more work is fine with me. But then I saw an &quot;evil Goku&quot;, and I was intrigued. Before I dig deep into this arc, a few things:<br />
• Yes, the time travel did get convoluted at times, but I still enjoyed it<br />
• Yes, the Potara retcon did annoy me at first, but I believe it will allow for more Vegito<br />
• Yes, the ending was a little lackluster, but I enjoyed it<br />
<br />
Now, with that out the way, I can truly dig in. Goku Black is a great villain, with a great voice in both English (via Xenoverse 2) and Japanese. Seeing how the Kaioshin from Universe 10 differ from the ones of Universe 7 was also nice. I loved seeing Trunks as a broken man, fighting for what little was left of humanity in his timeline. The arc was full of great moments, like the Final Kamehameha, Super Saiyan Rage (or even Rosé), and the conversation between Future Trunks and kid Trunks. By far, my favorite arc of Super so far. I do not recommend skipping it, but I do recommend reading the manga in addition to watching the anime. The  differences between the two are interesting, to say the least.<br />
<br />
                  -Universe Survival-<br />
Limit Break x Survivor is amazing. The subtle changes in the art style that were made are noticeable, and add a layer of beauty to the show. The fact that Goku sort of caused this arc by suggesting the tournament back in the Universe 6 arc shows to me that the writers remember previous arcs. Although we&#039;re still in the build-up to the actual tournament, I can clearly say why I think it&#039;s better than Super&#039;s other tournament arc. <br />
• It has real stakes, the destruction of multiple universes<br />
• Each member of our main team has had development<br />
• Goku&#039;s attitude has turned against him, everyone is targeting him<br />
• It feels like the story could go anywhere, while setting things up<br />
<br />
                  -Overall-<br />
Despite a rocky start, and lackluster moments, Dragon Ball Super has - at least in my eyes, become an entertaining and fun show to watch every week, with an endless amount of possibilities for the story. While it still takes place in that 10 year gap between the end of the Buu saga and the last episode of Z, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it went past that final moment after the Universe Survival arc. In fact, I hope it does! See, I enjoy Super so much because of where it could go with its concepts. Gods, other universes, I&#039;m really interested where the story goes next.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Dragon Ball fan, or just want some good fights, I definitely recommend Super. If you were turned off by the early episodes and their animation, give it another chance, will ya?

    Dragon Ball Super Review<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (6/10) Fair<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a great story in Dragon Ball (past the pre-DBZ stuff) in 2018 you are doing it wrong. We all know Akira Toriyama is far from the best when it comes to this department so I never go in looking to have my mind blown by it. But in my opinion at least it never gets to the point where it&#039;s completely brain dead stupid that I feel like my intelligence is being directly insulted (like Fairy Tail for example yes shots fired but no one is defending that anime&#039;s story anyway). The anime started off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274908">
        giving us the rehashed and in my opinion an overall inferior version of the Battle of Gods and Resurrection &#039;F&#039;, so many were quickly turned off during these two starting arcs and I don&#039;t blame them as it has some of the worse art style and animation the series had to offer regardless of the excuses or reasons of it looking the way they did, it should not have been released like that. A few changes like Ginyu making an appearance but nothing significant enough for anyone to say Toei did a better job the second time around with these to arcs in comparison to the movies. The Universe 6 Arc is when the series starts some new worth watching content as we get brand new characters. Although there were a few fights that were good like the Goku vs Hit fight majority of them fell short of what I and majority of the people I talked to after this arc was over expected. The story for this arc was decent and acceptable also especially with the ending introducing Zeno and revealing an even greater force to be reckoned with giving the series promise to where it would go next. The Future Trunks Arc after this was probably in my opinion the best arc in the entire series as it was the only time I personally felt the gave me the nostalgic feeling of actual threat to the characters and story. The execution in this arc I felt was quite good also even though there were a few short comings like the reveal of who Goku Black actually was and the who scheme behind it. Majority of this arc I felt keep it up with the standards that I remember back in the Z days. The final arc in the series The Universal Survival Arc was hyped up as it was hyped up to be a bigger and crazier version of the Universe 6 arc with it&#039;s one threat of the multiple universe at stake even though I was technically on a bigger scale of threat compared to the Future Trunks arc I guess since there was so many light heard and joky moments during this arc I never took it too massively serious. A ridiculous amount of build up to this arc, many many characters introduced and a shit ton of good fights. That&#039;s all good an all because coming into anything Dragon Ball like I said after Z that&#039;s all you are going to really get. Many many good fights happened in this arc definitely the best fights, animation and art style the series had showcased but from a story standpoint once again you shouldn&#039;t be expecting much especially from an arc that&#039;s basically just a giant Team Battle Royale which lasted basically over 1 year to conclude but 48 minutes in the show (how? idk). Although it didn&#039;t (at least to me) feel dragged out I do definitely have my issues with how some characters were handle but I&#039;ll mention more about that in the characters section. The Universal Survival Arc overall was a treat for the good fights we got out of it but I wouldn&#039;t call this the best arc just because it had the best fights I would give that to the Future Trunks arc. Either way you look at it all of the arcs presented in Super were fair at best and nothing to brag about to say the most. But like I&#039;ll say one more time story isn&#039;t the reason we watch Dragon Ball as it&#039;s not abysmal we fans of Dragon Ball accept it for what it is. (Or should I speak for myself?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (7/10) Good (For the most part)<br />
At it&#039;s worst (4/10)<br />
At it&#039;s best (10/10)<br />
More Specifically (7.00/10 when you average both of those together)<br />
<br />
The Beginning of Dragon Ball Super from an animation and art style standpoint I felt was it&#039;s biggest thing working against it. Coming out the gate looking look the hottest of garbage is the worst thing you can do for a first impressions for any series. Still to this day I felt it was a poor decision on Toei&#039;s part to let such a thing occur for those first few episodes should have been looking spotless, first impressions is extremely important and the result of what happened only proves this statement to be true as many many fans of Dragon Ball dropped it within the first 5 episodes when they saw such a pathetic excuse of art style and animation being showcased and still to this day have not returned to the series and I don&#039;t blame them. With all that being said just because the start of the anime was terrible doesn&#039;t mean it should be ignored as powerhouse animation directors like Yuya Takahashi and Naotoshi Shida eventually show up and blow everyone&#039;s heads off with their effort. Sadly even with their efforts the most the people who dropped the series will do is watch the clips of what they have done on Youtube say &quot;yeah that impressive but that crap at the start of the anime lost me and I can&#039;t invest the time to want to get to where ever the hell this is&quot;. Good things come to those who wait sure but like I said earlier first impressions are everything now these days especially in anime. And with all that being said overall not taking the worst of the worst or the best of the best from an animation standpoint into more consideration that the other on a regular basis the anime&#039;s art style and animation wasn&#039;t anything to brag or complain about to be honest and if you take that into consideration if the worst of the worst is averaged in with the best of the best you get the score I came out with which is a solid 7. I personally think it&#039;s fair since the best of the best is some of the best I&#039;ve seen in all of Dragon ball animation and I personally feel it outweighs the worst of the worst this anime has shown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10) Great<br />
More Specifically (9.50/10) Great+<br />
<br />
The sound for the anime I feel is the best part about it. From the openings to the countless endings, voice acting (JP VA), sound effects and background music I felt they were all great in every department in the sound category. They also did a great job and from the little that I&#039;ve heard from the English Dub, it sounds like everything is great over there also with some extra flair to it&#039;s dialogue script.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (6/10) Fair<br />
More Specifically (6.50/10) Fair+<br />
<br />
The characters in Dragon Ball were always something that was always endearing to me. But sadly over the time majority of the characters has failed to develop, impress or even stay relevant. The old saying in Dragon Ball Z (and even GT for that matter) days were &quot;if you aren&#039;t a Saiyan you ain&#039;t shit&quot;. But now in the days of Dragon Ball Super it&#039;s basically &quot;if you ain&#039;t Goku you ain&#039;t shit&quot;. Now we know the ultimate formula of layout of a Dragon Ball Z arcs for the most part goes bad guys show up Vegeta and maybe Piccolo get a fight, a win or two in until they get mopped then Goku shows up and takes it from there. Majority of the time this formula can be seen in all of the movies. When it came to Dragon Ball Super this formula never really is show cased. (And I&#039;m not counting the first two arcs since both of those were movies originally titled with a Z in their names vs a Super). Even though we don&#039;t see this predictable by now formula in Super doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s for the better or worse as changing from it only showcased it&#039;s pro and cons. One Pro is that since it isn&#039;t following that formula, it&#039;s hard to predict exactly will happen next, which is good to some degree. The cons show themselves a bit differently as each arc has it&#039;s new narrative content but from a story standpoint based on what the characters decided to do they have lead the story down such inconsistencies or disappointments that are shown though out each arc. Like I said I don&#039;t really care about high quality story telling when it comes to Dragon Ball and to tell high quality story telling in and story you must also have a high quality/well written characters to coincide the high quality story telling one can say they must go hand in hand. With that being said we all know characters in the Dragon Ball Universe aren&#039;t that impressive but we can agree that the characters are better and more interesting than the story they exist within right? (or am I alone on that statement also? anyway..). Either way I&#039;m not going to break down the issues I have with every single character that I thought had an issue with new or old that Super has showcased as this section is already long enough for you to understand where I&#039;m coming from. But what I will do is a quick run down ok?... and... Gohan is a disappointment, Vegeta is still and for ever will be behind Goku (but who isn&#039;t?) with Hit and Jiren being the new people pushing Goku farther sadly, Trunks was cool until he left, Hit was awesome until he gets whooped by the hyped up Jiren who&#039;s backstory is the most generic backstory I&#039;ve seen in a hot minute and also get&#039;s nerfed 80% of the way thru the arc and ultimately disappoints. Champa was cool tho right? Everyone else isn&#039;t worth mentioning even in this short period of time I&#039;ve given myself.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good<br />
More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+<br />

Regardless of everything that bothered me with Dragon Ball Super for the 2-3 years that it aired, I was basically present every single week nonetheless excited to some degree for the next episode it next felt like a shore to watch for me. On top of the fact that there wasn&#039;t any manga to be ahead of the anime so more so than often not knowing what was going to occur felt like the good old days of Dragon Ball Z. Will I miss Dragon Ball Super? Yeah I can&#039;t lie and say that I wouldn&#039;t, I love Dragon Ball as a franchise and any complaining I do above is only because I want to see it do better and is the main reason I why continued to watch it through thick and thin and I don&#039;t regret it. The amount of enjoyment I got out of Dragon Ball Super every Saturday for the past 2-3 years far exceeds the amount of disappointment that came with it.<br />

Overall (7/10) Good <br />
More Specifically (7.50/10) Good+<br />

With Dragon Ball Super concluding at the time of this review the only thing Dragon Ball we have is the manga which is changing a decent amount of content and the movie later this year. Dragon Ball has shown that it can come back and still be relevant as a top anime at least from a popularity standpoint. I do think that after the movie we will indeed get some sort of sequel to Dragon Ball Super who knows Dragon Ball Ultra? Either way farewell Dragon Ball until we meet again!

    There is a famous quote that I would like to apply to Dragon Ball Super, which says &quot;Everything that has a beginning comes to an end.&quot; Toei Animation, of course, ignored this quote while selfishly looking at the money bags that would come to them from producing this shameless sequel to Dragon Ball Z. They did not only ignore the quote, they made fun of it and said &quot;Do you underestimate the power of merchandising?&quot; <br />
<br />
Listen, I like Dragon Ball Z, I LOVE Dragon Ball Z, it was my favorite show as a child by far. I realize that Dragon Ball Super is really not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302756">
        meant for me anymore, but I had watched it as a 15/16 year old at the time of it&#039;s airing (The first three arcs at least), and it honestly fell apart after a few arcs, and did not feel like Dragon Ball anymore. <br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super starts off with a recap of both the Beerus movie, Battle of Gods, and the Frieza Movie, Resurrection of F. It&#039;s a shame they had to recap Battle of Gods because it was honestly a really great movie. Episode 5 of this arc has been widely regarded as one of the worst pieces of animation ever put to Anime. You know, when you start out with one of the best Dragon Ball movies and you ruin it just because you are this greedy, then the sequel is eventually going to be bad. The arc then got better eventually, Beerus is honestly a great villain/anti hero, his introduction was done well, his character design is pleasing to look at, and I&#039;d say he is easily in my top three villains in Dragon Ball due to how intimidating/fun he is. The fight between Goku and Beerus was really good, and I was surprised that it was this good considering how a number of weeks ago we had episode 5. This arc ended on a good note, and was good/great overall. <br />
<br />
I was thinking to myself &quot;Did Dragon Ball Super just have a great arc? Will this continue on? Will they better the animation? Will they have better character development? Will they get better villains?&quot; The short answer is no. Toei disappointed yet again in the following arc. Same old story, the animation in this arc was even worse. I genuinely could not believe, even as a 15 year old boy, that this was being broadcasted as an actual TV show. The animation during the Goku/Frieza fight is honestly an insult to all of Dragon Ball. The designs and the faces during the fight felt like they were being drawn by a child, not a professional animation studio. This is not to mention how Frieza jumped this high in power, horrible power scaling done to advance the plot. <br />
<br />
Since every one of Dragon Ball&#039;s arcs is condensed into a basic shonen formula, reviewing every single arc would be pointless, so let us look at Dragon Ball Super in a broader sense and discuss it&#039;s power scaling as a whole. I feel like the power scaling is what ruined all of Dragon Ball Super. <br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super&#039;s power scaling is just one big mess to be frank. Where do you start with it honestly? Dragon Ball Z did not always have the best power scaling. For example, you had the awfully inconsistent zenkai boosts during the Namek saga, something that Toriyama pulled right from his pocket and decided to just place it in there as a sudden explanation as to why Saiyans get stronger, and as a way for our heroes to always defeat the bad guys. Dragon Ball Super did not avoid this issue, they looked at the issue and asked &quot;How can we make this problem ten times worse than it already is?&quot; You have instances where even the hardcore Super fans cannot defend it. Instances such as Krillin fighting off against Super Saiyan Blue Goku. This fight was ridiculous, and you cannot honestly tell me that Goku was holding back, because if he was, he would have gradually transformed from his weakest form to his most powerful form. An excuse I hear about this is that Goku was trying to motivate Krillin into thinking he was doing well against him in his strongest form. Really? Did these people forget that Krillin knows that he is leagues below base level Goku? It was honestly just done to hype up the lame fight so that more viewers will watch, and to result in more controversy, therefore resulting in more publicity for the Anime. That is the only logical explanation. The fact that Goku started all out against Krillin, but not against Jiren is just ridiculous. The writers could have avoided all these problems by not having Goku turn into the eighth color of the rainbow against Krillin, with no explanation as to why. The writers dug themselves into this hole and should not be surprised at the negative backlash. <br />
<br />
It does not just stop with Krillin. Every single member of the team that Goku assembled during the TOP arc just magically got stronger. All of these average characters, who were nothing one episode before the TOP arc started, just got magically stronger than the eighth color of the rainbow. These characters trained for a mere fraction of the time that Goku and Vegeta had been training for, and got this strong. It&#039;s honestly a joke, and Dragon Ball Super can&#039;t be taking itself seriously at this point.... but it actually is.... <br />
<br />
The Zamasu arc is even worse than the preparation arc because Dragon Ball Super made even less sense than it usually does during this arc, and the asspulls were too much to handle. How can a guy like Trunks, who is infinitely weaker than Vegito/Zamazu, defeat Zamasu? Back in Dragon Ball Z, it took everyone on earth to  power up the spirit bomb to the point where it could kill Buu, but Trunks makes one that is a million times stronger with an abandoned city and a dead planet. Nobody can defend this terrible writing. I challenge any fan of this Anime to come and defend it. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s irritating to look at, and see irrelevant characters suddenly become relevant again, and become as strong as two characters who have been sweating blood for years to get to the level that they are at right now. 17, the most irritating character in the whole Anime, Trunks (I already talked about him above, one of my favorite characters in Dragon Ball Z was handled very poorly here), Gohan, Frieza. All of these characters got magically stronger than Goku and Vegeta. Please don&#039;t even get me started on the sorry excuse of a character that is Kefla. Dragon Ball Z at least explained how the characters got stronger during it&#039;s run. <br />
<br />
Of course powerscaling is not the only problem that this Anime has. A lot of stuff that is counter-intuitive happens in Dragon Ball Super, retcons that don&#039;t make any sense. An example of this would be the potara earring fusion. The potara earring fusion was always known to be a permanent fusion, meaning that the two individuals who use the earrings and fuse together cannot defuse if they wanted to. Dragon Ball Super could have defused Vegito the same way it did with the Supreme Kai, by using the super dragon balls, but it just was not the case here with these lazy writers. After they fused, the Anime decided to disregard the last thirty years of Dragon Ball and just place a time limit on the potara fusion. The stupidest retcon anyone can think of, and it ruined the fusion dance for me, because what&#039;s the use of the fusion technique when the potara earrings can now diffuse? Other than this awful retcon, there were many unexplained things. What about Super Saiyan Rose, which was never explained? Why didn&#039;t Zamasu switch bodies with Jiren, who was leagues above Goku? These are just some examples in the endless sea of retcons, unexplained stuff and awful narrative decisions this Anime makes. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even want to talk about the Tournament of Power arc, which was by far the worst arc in all of Dragon Ball Super. The segments where they show the characters explaining everything that happens during the fights are the very definition of cringe. How are we supposed to be entertained or informed when the characters talk about the most obvious of things that are happening? The only thing the audience of Gods and Angels talks about is how much stronger a character has gotten, or how a character is beating another character and is winning, that&#039;s it. You would think that they would give explanations to things that need an explanation, since they were cramming this much dialogue into the show, but they don&#039;t. Why not just let the fight play out as it should be without interrupting it every ten seconds? Are you that cheap, Toei Animation? Are you really that greedy that you can&#039;t even do one fight properly? Yeah, I know that Goku vs Jiren was a thing, but that was towards the very end of that arc, when Toei had already made ten times what they were hoping for. If you are going to not explain all of the stuff you wrote, then you can at least not place the loads of pointless dialogue you placed during TOP. One or two good fights in an entire series of bad does not excuse all of this. <br />
<br />
<br />
This Anime is an obvious disrespect to Dragon Ball Z, and it is a shameless cash grab done by Toei Animation so that they can make more money. This whole Anime was made to sell merchandise of the various forms that Goku and Vegeta obtain throughout all of it&#039;s run, it was not made to please the fans of the franchise. The feel of Dragon Ball is just gone here. Dragon Ball was great for it&#039;s time, it is still clearly memorable and the most popular Anime in the world, so a reboot was not necessary at all. But what do I know? Toei Animation owns the rights to the two most popular Anime on the planet, so clearly they are doing something right. <br />
<br />
Anyways, if you haven&#039;t for some odd reason seen this, then I advise you to just not watch it. Go watch or rewatch Dragon Ball Kai if you want to see Dragon Ball. Or go watch some of the Dragon Ball Z or Super movies. Both are much better use of your time.

    I know that since the start, many have given up on this series, But as for me I&#039;ve enjoyed the start to this series so far as well as seeing characters we have known for so long now are back yet again. <br />
Would I say its as good as the previous seasons? Definitely not. <br />
but I guess that will be subjective since it still hasn&#039;t gotten too far into this new story at the moment but it sure as HELL still beats Dragonball GT AKA GOKU TIME. Which as you guessed was the only purpose of that show was for Goku&#039;s character to have the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198100">
        entire spotlight and very little development unlike anybody else who hardly got any time to shine at all with there being no BEERUS, no WHIS, VADOS, HIT, JACO, or anything to show except for the badass SSJ4 Transformation which you don&#039;t see until the halfway point of GT. Apart from that, The entire thing was disappointing and forgettable which is why a lot of fans knew GT Sucked and why its only saving grace was its Art and its Japanese music score other than that everything else about it Lacked in execution Etc.<br />
Now as for Dragonball Super, It is sort of a continuation and at the same it isn&#039;t which is really weird if I&#039;m being honest. <br />
<br />
The problem so far with this premise from the start is that its hard to know the exact time where this series sort of starts off from. All that is mentioned is that it begins shortly after the Majin Buu arc in Dragonball Z after the defeat of Kid Buu.<br />
<br />
The first episode starts with Goku working in the fields with his son Goten as hes finding his new lifestyle quite dull, he is than met by Hercule who gives him a large sum of money for saving the world from majin buu, thanks to hercule, goku can go ahead in continuing his usual training that he so obsesses over while goten and trunks go on their mini adventure in finding a gift for videl. Meanwhile Vegeta finally plays the role of being a proper father to Trunks and husband to Bulma though that doesn&#039;t last to long knowing what saiyans can be like at times. <br />
<br />
Now from this point I don&#039;t think I need to mention too much of the premise of the story so far since after the first 2 episodes it pretty much follows the story told in the movie of Battle of gods with added padding which will be a turn off to some viewers out there which I don&#039;t blame since I also expected something of a new start which Isn&#039;t to say its bad but it isn&#039;t good thing either in the way how many fans feel mislead. but as of now Its working very well and obviously its been a series that was bound to happen whether you like it or not isn&#039;t relevant because Its here now.<br />
<br />
Some parts of the anime feel slows and not really that inspiring what so ever and other times it feels like its rushing on too far ahead which for the series is something that needs to improve on now. <br />
Dragonball Super at times can be entertaining and can get viewers demanding more pretty quick depending how you can tolerate it. So for the most part its best to not go into this series with such a high expectation of this, Otherwise It will feel stressful to get through since I feel the author Toriyama and Toei Animation in general are still living in the past. <br />
<br />
From the manga the current co writer of dragonball super, Toyotaro who is the writer of the dragon ball super manga is sticking very close at hand to toriyama&#039;s style. That alone could prove to provide some good material but maybe not always to the extent that we, the viewers want. which is always going to be a really tough thing in terms of living up to what has been previously done before in the franchise.<br />
<br />
My main concern with this series is how would this effect dragonball Z current ending where we left off from. after all we got to see new characters towards the end such as Uub, Pan, Bra, teen Goten and Trunks which would of been really cool if they were the new main characters of this series and If they were a lot more older like they were in the end of Z but even at this point on I&#039;m not sure what Toriyama or Toei Animation is thinking besides GIVE ME MONEY or whatever.<br />
<br />
So far in the story it has taken quite a familiar route in terms of what has been done but at least its more dragonball so I&#039;m thankful on that note (again my opinion). <br />
I appreciate that the animation is not dated like it was in the past and has been decent at some points but other times it looks Absolutely shameful in this day and age.<br />
<br />
This is not great at all despite the fact the first couple of episodes were really good and that episode 5 was really bad up and till now it has been very inconsistent especially where it should matter and that is in its action scenes but they have been very mediocre so far.<br />
<br />
The only great fight scene so far that has been done in all honesty to me was Goku Vs Beerus Godlike fight!! (Which most dragonball fights usually excel at) and yet since that there hasn&#039;t been many action scenes noteworthy which is a problem. at the same time the episodes are still watchable and I tend to enjoy some of the comedy, slice of life moments through the arcs now and then. Another thing that is great in this series is that you don&#039;t have see as much long segments of shouting and powerups like before, so keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
Toei Animation as some may know unless you really are living under a rock have a bad reputation with having too many projects on their hands to deal with along with their pre-production of new workers and whoever thats in charge of handling of the episodes and its source material would stop making this franchise so inconsistent then it already is now.<br />
<br />
So its no surprise on how they are going about this and considering how popular this franchise was before and still IS, <br />
You would think they would they would at least for the most part take the time to learn how to plan ahead of time and to animate their stuff properly regardless of their budget and working conditions to how they are finding it tough which to me is only excuse of demanding more business profit without even really taking to much care or consideration over the show or its fanbase. <br />
<br />
Can WE just for once have some thought put into this SHOW!!? <br />
Come ON TOEI!! This is SERIOUS business here anyone of us could do a better job than what they are doing with Super so far And Plus SUPER?! Really thats the best title they could come up with? never mind the fact its connected to the whole lore of the Super Dragonballs itself.<br />
<br />
Besides my annoyance so far what I will say I&#039;m enjoying the most so far in this are the characters such as their take on Beerus who is overwhelmingly powerful in this version and rightfully so being a God of destruction than he was in the movie and I do like seeing the other characters now but to be fair I would of like to expect more urgency put into the story like for example A great new Galactic Threat anyone? with such powerful characters appearing and being introduce there has been a real lack in terms of danger <br />
IN This SHOW! Why!? <br />
<br />
To be fair I know the chances of danger is there as it has been in the previous series despite the fact there dragonballs but now with powerful characters maintaining balance the problem is the danger is always going to be imminent to begin with.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that the new content also from here on in would be enough to suffice after 28 episodes in but if it isn&#039;t I will have to resort to putting my rating further down for this show.<br />
<br />
Now the Biggest Gripe I liked to mention in Dragonball Super, is its struggle to recall its glory days of the previous series. The plot takes fans on a roller coaster ride through less tension or urgency ever occurring which I will now touch upon. <br />
<br />
So to start off, Each arcs has its own virtues and vices, and have slowly but steadily improved with some new content. Battle of The Gods saga can sum up as a frustrating comedic circus of characters that focuses more on family values and food than martial arts or self improvement. <br />
<br />
Dragonball Super honestly might as well play out like a family comedy with few occasional action segments in between. The God of Destruction&#039;s goals seem to revolve around delicious meals rather than universal annihilation or ambition. Thus, dish after dish of Japanese cuisine is served throughout certain arcs, taking the place of questing for dragon balls and martial arts training. After an anti-climatic ending, the next saga jumps immediately into the action and then after that it just falls into real retarded stuff after.<br />
<br />
Though more action-packed, the Resurrection of F story arc relies heavily on nostalgia to make up for faults of the previous arc. The positive qualities of this arc can be found in flashbacks, A former villain returning in Frieza and fight sequences that look straight out of WWE! funny enough I prefer this over that crap any day of the week Imo, no offence to WWE Fans though Its still plagued by comedic distractions like Jaco the space patrolman and strawberry sundaes so what ever rows your boat I guess. <br />
However Jaco is made for some real good moments for his character especially within Super.<br />
<br />
Now for the current Arc this multi-universal tournament is the series’ first opportunity to show viewers what DBS is really all about. More new opponents are introduced to provide more combat, however the new characters appearance are just unappealing A lot of these new characters are simply just recycled character designs. <br />
<br />
The fights shown are completely underwhelming and we that dragonball as a franchise excels in this really well but Toei Animation just Shits all over this making the characters mundane in their understanding and progression as well as making fans doubt a lot what they have seen from Dragonball and Dragonball Z Respectively which is sad to see. <br />
<br />
Catch all that? Yes, that is how its been so far in terms of its inconsistencies that it has shown In other words It has taken over 30 episodes of recycled scripts and filler, but at this point I cant really judge the entirety of this review until I see this arc and the rest of Dragonball Super play out. <br />
<br />
We know from watching this far this series that it hasn&#039;t really tried to step up so far which I have no idea why but at the same time because we are in an entirely new arc we finally have gained some traction by shifting its focus back to the action, putting down the fork, leaving the wife and kids on the sidelines, and stepping back into the ring in the midst of fight.<br />
<br />
For me they should of just let this series rest along with many other series I can think of out there. however I&#039;ve always been in favourite of this franchise and like a lot of anime out there that isn&#039;t going to change.<br />
<br />
Score Rating<br />
<br />
Story thus far: 5<br />
Sound/Music: 5<br />
Character: 7<br />
Animation/Art: IGN Rating 10/10. My rating: TOEI GO FUCK YOURSELVES!.<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
Overall: Undecided but for me its a 5 which In case you don&#039;t know it means just Average.<br />
<br />
I recommend checking out the manga if your that desperate since its better handled than the anime. Do keep in mind however that the manga is monthly and is only just been overtaken by the anime at this point.<br />
<br />
Other than that Do not be in a rush to check this anime out at all just yet, not until everything of this show is said and done which will be a long time but either way take my advice.

    After years of waiting, Dragon Ball Super has finally come too end, and I can say that this has been one bizarre ride. This series reaches both some pretty meh lows yet also reaches some highs that haven&#039;t been seen in Dragon Ball before! <br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Super is comprised of 5 major arcs that are all different in terms of quality but thankfully just gets better as it goes on. The first 27 episodes are retellings of Battle of Gods and Ressurection F which are just much worse versions from their movie counterparts. They&#039;re slower paced, include some more filler, and look really shitty. They aren&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319332">
        terrible by any means but at best they&#039;re just whatever, really no reason for them to exist besides Toei making some more cash. The first new arc of Super is 6 vs. 7 which is fine but rather disappointing. It&#039;s just a basic 5 1v1 tournament which isn&#039;t new to the series of course. Goku Black is also disappointing, flawed, but also a good arc nonetheless. Then there&#039;s the Tournament of Power which sort of saved or made the series a lot better and more popular. I&#039;ve heard nothing but good things about it and thankfully it did not disappoint me. The Tournament of Power is great, it is by far the best arc in Super. After 20 episodes of buildup, it is nothing but nonstop action all the way until the end, it is everything I wanted from it. Sadly the actual tournament is only about a fourth of Super and including the buildup episodes its still about less than half of the series. <br />
For Super&#039;s actual plot, it focuses most of its time on the Gods, Angels, Universes, and Deities. It&#039;s much more grand than the likes of the Majin Buu saga but at this point it doesn&#039;t really matter who Goku and Vegeta will be fighting. Frieza was apparently the most powerful being in the universe during the Frieza saga, but then some scientist on Earth made androids that could overpower Frieza ten folds, and then we found out that another super powerful monster has been on Earth too. What I mean is, Dragon Ball&#039;s power scaling and power levels haven&#039;t been realistic for quite awhile and Super is no exception. In Resurrection F, we learn that Frieza has never trained a day in his life so after training for a near 4 months he is able to catch up Goku and Vegeta. Things like this are more apparent in Super and while it doesn&#039;t ruin the show by any means, its still something that bothers me whenever they show up. Besides power and speed becoming unrealistic and stupid, Super has some other problems. I think my biggest problem would have to be the butchering of super saiyans. Now I believe that the series has had this problem ever since Trunks turned into one and sliced up Frieza back in Z along with kid Trunks and Goten. However its much more aggravating here this time. Caba&#039;s transformation in 6 vs. 7 was fine but Kale and Caulifla&#039;s transformations are just really dumb. Plus they can easily go from Super Saiyan to SS2 in no time which is just a big middle finger to all the time and struggle we saw with Gohan back in the Cell saga. <br />
Overall though, Super&#039;s arcs are very mixed ranging from just whatever to great.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Oh boy how times have changed. DBZ has never looked good or at least besides the movies which of course had more time and budget. I can defend Z&#039;s art to a certain extent. The animation or lack there of was really bad and lacking, reusage of shots and animation were iconic, and the show could just look bad in general. However, as the series went on, the still shots looked much better was more noticeable in the Buu and even Cell sagas, plus Toriyama&#039;s character designs are amazing and is one reason why the manga is my favorite looking manga. But this is Super and not Z. Everyone knows the first 27 episodes looked like garbage, the DVD releases didn&#039;t improve much and they still look like shit. 6 vs. 7 wasn&#039;t much better either. Goku Black arc looked decent or at least not bad. However, this is Dragon Ball, one of the biggest animes ever. It deserves so much more time and respect than this. Somehow the series made a complete turnaround once the Tournament of Power arc started. The 20 episodes of buildup actually look good, its what Dragon Ball should look like. Characters are usually on model, the fights look good, its colorful, has a new boldness to it and it just looks good for once. Thankfully that wasn&#039;t enough, and Toei actually began to use some of the endless amounts of money they&#039;ve been saving up and hired talented animators and directors for the Tournament of Power. Most of it looks really, really good. I am actually shocked and had no idea Dragon Ball could look this good before and as it went on it only got better. Some fights look amazing and even on par, yes you heard me, ON PAR with the newer movies. Some of the last episodes look fantastic and I swear it looks like Bones or Madhouse could&#039;ve made them. Sadly this is only for a fourth of the entire run so I can&#039;t say Super overall looks great.<br />
Besides the animation itself I think its important to talk about the character designs. Super&#039;s newer characters look good, however it is obvious that they are much more simple and not as detailed as some of Dragon Ball&#039;s older cast. This could have been done for the animators to have an easier time animating more movement instead of the working on details on the characters but obviously that wasn&#039;t the case earlier on and the Tournament of Power proves this wrong. I&#039;m not a big fan of Super&#039;s newer designs since they are more simple but I still enjoy most of them.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
There is not much I would say that Super does better than Z but I will give credit where credit is due. Super&#039;s soundtrack is pretty damn good. I&#039;m not a huge fan of Z&#039;s soundtrack in the first place, or at least the original Japanese score, but I am a fan of Funimation&#039;s Bruce Faulconer score which is great. If I were to describe Super&#039;s soundtrack in just one word it would probably be epic. This honestly makes a lot of sense wince the show is now about gods and whatnot and I&#039;m glad the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to. Although both good, I am disappointed to see that Super only has 2 OPs for a 131 episode series. It has 11 ending themes and most of them are good especially Hello Hello Hello and Boogie Back. Also, for me, I watch 99% of anime dubbed and Dragon Ball is at the top of the best dubs out there. The Japanese cast just sounds so weird and Goku sounds like a grandma which is ridiculous. I can not stand the sub of Dragon Ball at all. Thankfully, Funimation&#039;s dub still had it. Christopher Sabat and Sean Schimmel still provide great performances as Goku and Vegeta and all the returning cast from Kai are great too. However, I will say that the dub isn&#039;t perfect and has some downsides. I&#039;m probably in the minority on this but I much prefer Linda Young&#039;s chain smoker Frieza from Z instead of Christopher Ayres&#039; Frieza. That&#039;s not to say his performance isn&#039;t bad, he&#039;s a great actor and all and I do enjoy his Frieza but I don&#039;t love it like I do with Linda&#039;s. Some of the side characters or some newer roles that Funimation casted aren&#039;t that great and they&#039;re voices you hear in literally every other anime they dub. These voices are usually good but not great. Also another downside to the dub would be its English version of the Ultra Instinct song. It&#039;s much more quieter and just sounds a lot worse than the Japanese one which is odd because I actually enjoy the English covers on Super&#039;s 2 OPs.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
Dragon Ball has always had a great cast of characters before and Super&#039;s cast is far from bad, although I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s as amazing as OG Dragon Ball&#039;s or Z&#039;s. Super focuses a lot of its time mainly on Goku and Vegeta along with Beerus and Whis. Side characters such as Hercule, Buu, Krillin, and many others get screen time too but you&#039;ll mostly be seeing just Vegeta and Goku. Dragon Ball has been leaning towards giving Goku and Vegeta the main attention ever since the Buu saga since the idea of making Gohan the main character didn&#039;t turn out the way Toriyama wanted it to. This was also done because again, the power scaling is just unrealistic and off the charts so characters like Gohan, Piccolo, and Krillin shouldn&#039;t be able to do anything. Super fixes this small problem halfway through once the Tournament of Power is on its way and we get to see characters such as Krillin, Androids 17, 18, Tien, and even Master Roshi kick some ass. Besides beating up some soldiers in Resurrection F, we haven&#039;t seen Roshi fight since OG Dragon Ball. Choices like this are awesome and I love it. It&#039;s been forever since we&#039;ve seen some of these characters duke it out. Even if it&#039;s not for a lot, I still highly appreciate the fan service Super did with some of these characters. Plus we get to see Frieza and Goku team up for the first time ever which is insane!<br />
Besides the old cast, there&#039;s obviously a good amount of new faces too. Beerus and Whis are both great and hilarious at times. Hit, Universe 6&#039;s Saiyans, Goku Black, and other from the Tournament of Power are also welcome. Some of the newer characters aren&#039;t great like Zamasu or some of the lesser character from the Tournament but overall a good amount of the newer characters are good and the returning cast is still great.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
I&#039;m a huge fan of shounen especially when it comes to Dragon Ball. I get way too much enjoyment out of Super than I have any right to. Even though the first 27 episodes aren&#039;t good I still had no problem watching a bunch of episodes in one sitting. I watched the Goku Black arc in 2 sittings and pretty much 3 big sittings for The Tournament of Power which is 55 episodes let me remind you. Dragon Ball Z and Super is one of the easiest anime to binge so no real complaints here. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
Dragon Ball Super is a very mixed and flawed anime. Starting off really underwhelming and disappointing turns into one of the best arcs in the series. I still love Dragon Ball and Super is a welcomed addition to the series. While not all of it is great, it never comes close to the garbage that is GT.  <br />

    Dragon Ball Super when it first started out, was widely criticized by many due to many reasons.<br />
<br />
Firstly, poor animation. DBS started out with poor animation, considering it can cost up to $300,000 to make one episode, this is understandable but having better animation would certainly be more appealing.<br />
<br />
Second, power scaling problems. There are many many &#039;flaws&#039; to Dragon Ball as a whole not just DBS. It just doesn&#039;t make sense that someone clearly weaker or more inexperienced can fight toe to toe with someone much much much stronger. <br />
<br />
One of the more common talking points is Frieza being able to beat Goku after only four

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302420">
        months of training. If that&#039;s the case, take into account that Frieza at 100 percent power gave Super Saiyan Goku trouble way back on Namek, without training a day in his life. His raw strength was so much so that he never had to train to confront anyone stronger than him—at the time, he was the strongest in the universe (Beerus and Majin Buu were asleep) so it makes sense for him to be that strong. <br />
<br />
 I’ve seen a lot of people say that characters like Gohan and Android 17 were able to make Goku go Super Saiyan Blue so they must be at god-level strength. This is not the case because Goku’s Blue form does not have a rigid power level. Since it depends on perfect ki control, Goku can modify his energy output so as to not go all out and destroy people or even planets. Come on guys, are you seriously telling me that Goku was going 100 percent on Gohan and 17? If he wanted to, he could have easily wiped the floor with them in an instant. If you’re saying that Goku went to Blue because these characters were THAT strong, then explain to me why Blue wasn’t effective against Zamasu at all? Or why Vegito—arguably the strongest character in the entire franchise—had to be formed to stand a chance of beating him? There’s no other explanation other than Goku holding back. <br />
<br />
Third, many fans complain that DBS is only about Goku, that is true but there is nothing wrong with that because the show is about HIM, it&#039;s like saying &#039;WHY IS NARUTO IN EVERY EPISODE OF NARUTO&#039; because the show IS ABOUT NARUTO not everyone else in the Hidden Leaf Village.<br />
<br />
While I&#039;m here, I&#039;m also going to address Gohan’s character development, which is STILL somehow a huge talking point for the series. <br />
<br />
Let me make this clear. Gohan is not a Saiyan—he is a half Saiyan. Gohan never liked fighting. He never reveled in it. From the get go, he has always tried to resolve things peacefully and without conflict. He only fought because he was forced to, not because he WANTED to. So WHY people are complaining about the fact that he’s not kicking butt on screen every other episode is beyond me. He was NEVER meant to fight. He wanted to just live a normal life as a student. He’s doing something now in the latest arc, which is great to see for nostalgia purposes, but if you&#039;re going to say that Dragon Ball Super is a bad show because Gohan isn&#039;t fighting, then you really need to reconsider how well you know the series in the first place. <br />
<br />
BUT.<br />
<br />
With the end of the series and the final arc finished, I&#039;&#039;m sure all you DB fans are finally satisfied. Everything I mentioned above was fixed even though in my opinion none of it was actually wrong. Let&#039;s just say it was a necessary improvement, not really to improve the anime but to please the fans whilst improving the anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d safely say 1/3 of the anime was the Tournament of Power, one of the most epic arc or to be more precise, the arc that contains the most epic battles.<br />
<br />
The animation also improved drastically if I don&#039;t say so myself. The Tournament of Survival Arc is literally a 48 minute battle that lasted through an epic series of consecutive battles throughout a good 50 episodes.<br />
<br />
This was no doubt the main &#039;comeback&#039; for DBS and this of course helped the anime end in a BANG<br />
<br />
Power scaling was still a bit of a problem but the anime managed to provide some or at least a slight bit of explanation to why certain characters are suddenly/still so strong.<br />
<br />
And with the arc featuring the strongest warriors in all of the universes, we get to see every character getting much much stronger due to breaking past their limit. This was very predictable however it was understandable and very well done because it all had one reason and that was survival.<br />
<br />
It allowed development for almost every main character in the arc for that one simple reason. Because similar to real life, in a battle for survival one can and will go above and beyond their limits to survive.<br />
<br />
Of course, Goku went well above his limits and I can say the same for all our warriors in the Tournament of Power, even the enemies of our Universe 7 warriors went beyond themselves to fight for survival.<br />
<br />
This allowed us to capture everyone&#039;s &#039;Full Power&#039; and be amazed at the new levels of power they achieve and also take us on a rollercoaster of feelings as despite becoming overpowered from breaking their limit, nothing is decided simply because breaking your own limit takes a huge toll on your stamina and because of that fact, once your stamina wears off, you can&#039;t do anything at all.<br />
<br />
Our main character Goku was the epitome of that. He broke his limit once in an epic battle against the strongest mortal being in all universes, Jiren and attained a level that even gods fear, Ultra Instinct. He then lost almost all his stamina and afterwards attaining UI again when fighting Kefla, another super strong Saiyan and finally mastering it and using it once more in the final fight against Jiren. He tired himself out time and time again but endured till the final battle where he ended up working with none other than.<br />
<br />
Frieza<br />
<br />
There was ALOT of development for other characters as well, their personality and all for example who would have ever thought someone like Frieza would end up working together with Saiyans the main beings he despises when pushed/cornered to his limit or Frieza actually saving so many of Universe 7 warriors, even boldly sacrificing himself and actually putting his trust on them and them actually trusting him.<br />
<br />
Truly an unexpected turn of events and true character development. Who would&#039;ve known how much one can change in a battle of survival or when cornered. I&#039;m really glad that the anime actually seized the opportunity to develop every character largely through this ark.<br />
<br />
With this one ark alone, everything the fans were hating on at the beginning was fixed. It also showed us that teamwork was very important since most of the time our characters would be selfish and attempt to 1v1 their opponents.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the introduction of many clearly superior and truly overpowered opponents including one way way way beyond anyone Universe 7 ever faced, it helped our characters realize working alone isn&#039;t possible and even allowed someone like Frieza, not to mention our prideful Vegeta to understand and work together with their most hated comrades or letting go of their pride to beat their enemy.<br />
<br />
Yes, I&#039;ve begun to like Frieza through this ark despite him still being a ruthless dick actually seeing a change just once is really cool. And seeing how all our strongest MCs get pushed to a corner so badly, barely holding their own until they surpass their limits is very entertaining.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d say the final arc more than makes up for the beginning and this is probably one of the coolest and most amazing character development I&#039;ve ever seen in Dragon Ball History.<br />
<br />
<br />
Continue to amaze me. <br />
Till we meet again<br />
<br />
<br />

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS**<br />
My relationship with Dragon Ball : I had watched bits of Dragon Ball when I was a kid but I never knew the complete story. Then, in 2014 I binge watched DBKai and Final Chapters and realised that this was the greatest anime of all time. Then came Dragon Ball Super. <br />
<br />
Summary of how I think I felt during the story :<br />
First 28 episodes were retelling of the movies with shitty art and animation. Watch the movies instead. <br />
<br />
Next came the Tournament arc with Universe 6. Finally, got new content. It was good. This arc introduced many new characters and new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review275846">
        information like Universe 6 Saiyans, Multiple Universes, Super Dragon Balls and Zeno. It opened up infinite possibilities for the series and I was really excited to see the direction in which the series would have gone, only to be let down afterwards. <br />
<br />
Then came the Future Trunks saga. This arc had its moments but overall it was a bad arc in my opinion. Trunks getting emotional was really sad to watch and you could feel his pain. The animation had improved slightly for the fights. The idea of Black Goku was intriguing and  the villain was well written. He was not just another generic baddie. Beerus killing Zamasu was one of the best moments in the entire series. However, later the arc went downhill. We couldn&#039;t make any sense of the power levels(but that&#039;s a problem that plagued the whole of Super), and the fights were too fan fiction-ey. The ending didn&#039;t make any sense with Trunks somehow defeating the villian with a power up.<br />
<br />
Next was the Universe Survival Saga. It was great until the last few episodes. They changed how the anime looked to give it the old feel and the art and animation got a lot better. I didn&#039;t mind the bad animation of Super until then since I was watching a version of the show where Goku was voiced by an old lady. This change in the look of the show gave a lot of fans including me, the hope that the series might be finally getting better. The animation and art was brilliant at some points and the episodes were really entertaining. There were many twists including the inclusion of Frieza which was unexpected. We even got a mysterious villian called Jiren who looked invincible who was then revealed at the end to be an uninteresting baddie with a shitty backstory. The final episodes were...different. Overall a 7/10 anime. <br />
<br />
Pros: <br />
-More Dragon Ball <br />
-World building and new possibilities with the introduction of multiverse. <br />
-Beerus and Whis<br />
-Some epic moments, fight scenes, twists and some slice of life episodes. <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
-Subpar art and animation for the majority of the show. <br />
-No sense of power levels. <br />
-Power ups without explanations and new forms just to sell toys. <br />
-Turning Goku from a battle genius who didn&#039;t give a shit about anything else into an idiot whose good at fighting and achieving new asspull forms just like that because that&#039;s what Saiyans do.(according to Vegeta anyway).<br />
<br />
-Turning Dragon Ball Z and all its characters kids friendly. (I know Dragon Ball was a kids show but still...). <br />
-Turning the bulky characters to stick figures. <br />
<br />
Music : Some tracks from Final Chapters were reused for this anime. I felt that the number of tracks were low. Same music was played throughout the anime with very few additions in the last arc. <br />
<br />
Overall 7/10. Watch it if you want to.

    Dragonball super is among the worst animes I have ever seen. I strongly recommend you to not even start watching this crap. I honestly think that this show slowly ruins the reputation of Dragonball. In the following I will present you my reasons why I absoulte hate this show.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
The first two arcs of this anime are nothing else than retellings of the Battle of Gods and Fukatsu no F movies. If you have seen the movies the roughly first 30 episodes are completely pointless. On top of that they dragged the events out for the worse. Therefore the pacing in the first two arcs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242106">
        is just horrible. (1/10)<br />
The Universe 6 arc is a little bit better but still nothing special and complete trash in comparison to the Tournaments we had back in the Original Dragonball. It&#039;s obvious that the creators didn&#039;t put much thought in the designs of the Universe 6 participants. The fights are mostly uninteresting and lack tension. (3/10) <br />
The Black Goku arc started out promising at first but in the end it was just as bad as the previous arcs. Especially the ending is full of aspulls and it has one of the worst conclusion to an arc I have ever seen. (3/10)<br />
Another thing that really bothers me is that you really can&#039;t tell anymore how strong a character is, it all just makes no sense anymore. I know that DBZ to an extent especially in the Buu saga suffered from this problem as well, but in Super it&#039;s just gotten completely out of hand.<br />
All in all the story lacks tension and for the majority of it it&#039;s uninteresting and the writing is just horrible considering the amounts of asspuls throughout of it. Sure there were some episodes that were individually good but as a whole every arc was pretty bad.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
<br />
The art is really just pathetic. Just from that you can tell the creators don&#039;t give a fuck about this series. We live in 2017 and this trash is what they give us. Even compared to Dragonball and Dragonball Z it sucks bad and they were released more than 20 years ago.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
The sound is nothing special, pretty average. But still a huge step down from Db and Dbz which had amazing soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
Honeslty this is by far the worst aspect of the show. Every character has become a parody of themselves. Almost none of the characters acts the way they should. Videl has pretty much lost all of her character traits. In fact now in Super you could replace her with any standard anime girlfriend and it wouldn&#039;t even matter. Chichi bitches in every scene she is shown. With Gohan they exaggerated it with this whole &quot;Not a fighter&quot; trait.<br />
But by far the most damage has been done to Vegeta and especially to our main character Son Goku. Even though in the Buu saga Vegeta admitted that Goku is the Number 1, now he just behaves the way he did before. After the Buu saga Vegeta became friends with Goku and you could see he matured. It&#039;s like he just regressed as a character. Goku on the other hand has become a complete retard, infact even his kid self wasn&#039;t this much of an idiot. In Z you could see that Goku matured. Even though he loved fighting there were other things as well he cared for like the well being of his family and friends. He was selfish in Z as well but he was always aware of it and took responsibility when he fucked up. In super on the other hand they took his retarded and selfish side and leveled them up to new heights. He really just became a parody of himself and it hurts since they are slowly ruining a character I always loved.<br />
Characters like Gohan, Piccolo, Yamacha, Tenshinhan etc barely get any screen time anymore. To be honest the only characters I think they didn&#039;t ruin is Bulma and maybe Goten and kid Trunks.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
<br />
Because of all these flaws this show has I could barely enjoy it. I will be honest some episodes in between will be enjoyable if you turn off your brain, but most of the time even this won&#039;t help. <br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
<br />
As I said before I recommend you to just avoid this terrible excuse of a show. Even Dragonball GT as bad as it was, is good compared to this shit. If it woudn&#039;t be for the name Dragonball in the title, it would never become as popular as it is today. The characters, the story, the art just everything about this anime sucks and it&#039;s clear that the only purpose of this show is to make some fast money because people will watch it anyway no matter how bad it is since it&#039;s Dragonball.  <br />

    After being hyped for a while I caught up with the anime today, and decided to write a review because...why not. Being a hardcore DB fan in the past, I was really excited to get a canon continuation of DBZ, but...<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
<br />
The story gets a 2 because the anime is so far a rehash of the two movies that came out, Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. The only difference is the awful pacing this time. You&#039;re better off watching both movies and skipping what I reckon will be 30 episodes of the anime. The storylines themselves aren&#039;t anything to write home about either.<br />
<br />
Also,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review206791">
        speaking of DBZ, one can&#039;t help but bring up powerlevels. There&#039;re a lot of inconsistencies here. One example, one of Friezan&#039;s new henchmen is supposed to be stronger than the old Ginyu force (confirmed with a scouter), which means that even Goten should be able to wreck him without any effort, let alone Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, or freaking Gohan. <br />
<br />
Yet he proceeds to solo EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM without any effort at the same time. Seriously? Piccolo in the original DBZ was fighting Frieza&#039;s second form to a stalemate and he&#039;s gotten a lot more powerful than that by Cell Saga, going toe to toe with 17, and first form Cell, and then even more powerful in the Buu Saga. Getting wrecked by a guy at Ginyu&#039;s level or so (hell, or even double, triple, quadruple that) was ridiculous to watch. Facepalm.<br />
<br />
Art: 3<br />
<br />
Art gets a 3 because it&#039;s bad. Scenes which were copied from the movies look spectacular (since the movies are high quality) but everything else looks absolutely terrible, and for no reason at all. TOEI has the budget, they&#039;re simply lazy it seems. Anyone who&#039;s used to the awesome, detailed, perfectly proportioned character models from DBZ which could be used as wallpapers, will notice the terrible drawings right away. Couldn&#039;t help but getting bothered by it and asking why.<br />
<br />
Sound: 3<br />
<br />
Sound gets a 3. DB is probably the only anime which is better in english DUB than SUB, but I watched the SUB nonetheless. The Goku-granny needs to go. Sure, nostalgia goggles and whatnot...but it&#039;s just not right. Goku being as old as he is...it&#039;s just not right when he sounds like a kid or a woman. Better stick with the ENG DUB.<br />
<br />
The openings and endings, although catchy, are a total mismatch for the series. I&#039;d rather have badly remixed versions of the old openings than this. The OST in the anime is practically nonexistant. I noticed only a couple of musical pieces that play here and there, easily forgettable. They contribute nothing to the excitement of the anime. <br />
<br />
Characters:  5<br />
<br />
Characters get a 5. Goku is pretty much the same, Vegeta is a lot less hostile than before, Whis is a joke and plot device, but the worst thing about the anime has got to be Beerus. I actually liked Beerus in the movies. Sure, he had his idiotic and playful side, but it was also pretty obvious that he was somebody who KNEW STUFF, somebody who was above our heroes in terms of knowledge and wisdom, befitting of his age. <br />
<br />
But this Beerus in the anime acts like a spoiled ass for absolutely no reason at all. Sure, that makes him a tad scarier, knowing you can&#039;t reason with him, but after a certain point, all that gets thrown out the window in a moment&#039;s notice, and he turns a companion? That&#039;s bad. Facepalm.<br />
<br />
Moving into the Frieza part of the anime, Frieza is satisfying, truly evil, angry and really crazy. He&#039;s awesome, but in true DBZ fashion, characters who are pissed off and have sworn to kill each other, stop in the middle of the battle in order to talk about who fights whom first, and tell each other to wait for power ups/transformations. <br />
<br />
Really??? That might be alright in Beerus&#039; case, since he wanted to fight a strong opponent,and was actively searching for one, and maybe for Frieza in the past who was simply arrogant coz he had never lost a fight, but THIS Frieza? One moment he&#039;s fuming with anger about everything he went through in HELL, then he&#039;s torturing someone for sadistic pleasure until his nemesis arrives, and when said nemesis does arrive, he&#039;s chitchatting with him over pointless stuff. The one guy whom he&#039;ll do ANYTHING TO SEE DEAD FOREVER. Ridiculous. Facepalm.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2<br />
<br />
All in all this is a dreadful series and less enjoyable than anything that came before it. Watch the Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F movies, and skip this anime altogether. Not really worth it. At least not yet. Maybe once they&#039;re done with rehashing the movies...<br />

    Dragon Ball Super is the worst piece of fiction ever created. <br />
<br />
This is the most disappointing thing I have ever watched in my life. This anime is an absolute disgrace to Dragon Ball Z, and it should&#039;ve never been made. The only reason anyone even likes Dragon Ball Super is because it has the words &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in the title. Everyone would be hating on it if it was its own series, but if Dragon Ball is on it then nope people will like it. <br />
<br />
Why is it that some writers/creators don&#039;t know when to end a series? They end up milking it so hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308764">
        to the point where it becomes utter garbage just for the sake of making more money. Dragon Ball Super is the perfect example of milking at it&#039;s finest. Dragon Ball Z ended normally, it should&#039;ve never went on after that. Unfortunately, Dragon Ball Super takes everything that made Dragon Ball Z so great and throws it out the window.<br />
<br />
All of the characters and everything we used to love about Drago Ball Z turned into total shit now. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying this because of nostalgia. From a quality standpoint, Dragon Ball Super is objectively worse than Dragon Ball Z. Now here are some reasons as to why Dragon Ball Super is a complete and utter failure.<br />
<br />
Again, Dragon Ball Super takes everything that made DBZ great and just throws it out. There is no great character development in Dragon Ball Super like there was in Dragon Ball Z. The fights are not nearly as exciting to watch and not nearly as good as in general. The characters become complete and utter garbage. The villains are awful. The story arcs are hands down some of the worst story arcs in the entire Dragon Ball series. <br />
<br />
First off, the characters. This anime has completely ruined some amazing characters, and also introduces us to even more bad characters. Firstly, Vegeta&#039;s character has been ruined on multiple occasions. In this animes early stages, we see Vegeta kissing Beerus&#039;s ass. That was absolutely ridiculous. I understand that he was just trying to keep the earth safe, but this completely contradicted his character. Vegeta would&#039;ve never kissed Frieza&#039;s ass no matter what happened. Not even Cell or Majin Buu. For fucks sake, he sacrificed himself to try and defeat Majin Buu. Vegeta has always been a prideful warrior, but this shitty anime makes him someone&#039;s slave for the sake of unfunny comedy.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but Vegeta just doesn&#039;t act the same at all. You see Vegeta in the ToP arc making friendship speeches and saying things that he would never say. When he got a bullshit friendship powerup against Toppo to win I was absolutely disgusted. It&#039;s as if the show just randomly turned into Fairy Tail...On multiple occasions he&#039;s acting completely out of character, which is awful writing. <br />
<br />
The rest of the Z fighters are a complete joke. Gohan is way too into academics now. I cant complain about Super for that one though. Gohan was ruined as a character after the Cell saga...Piccolo is extremely weak and is just a baby sitter now. I cant believe this anime took the badass Piccolo and ruined him this badly. <br />
<br />
This anime is just about Goku and Vegeta. The rest of the Z fighters are completely useless and irrelevant. Remember when Gohan was a badass and went SSJ2 against Cell? You&#039;ll never see Gohan that badass again. Remember when Piccolo and the rest of the Z fighters were actually badass and fun characters to watch? Yeah I remember. Unfortunately this shity anime has made them all a joke.<br />
<br />
The animation in Dragon Ball Super is absolutely atrocious. I&#039;m not even talking about the first 30 episodes either, the entire series as a whole has bad animation. Many fights are so poorly animated it&#039;s ridiculous. Goku vs Beerus, Vegito vs Zamasu, Jiren vs Goku, all of these fights were so poorly animated it&#039;s ridiculous. Now of course there were moments in each of these fights with good animation, but those moments barely last that long. For the most part, the fights have shitty animation and aren&#039;t visually interesting in the slightest.<br />
<br />
DBZ also didn&#039;t have the best animation as well, but there&#039;s a difference. DBZ still had awesome fights and didn&#039;t look completely ugly when there was bad animation. Goku vs Majin vegeta for example. The animation wasn&#039;t the best, but it was still a better fight than anything I&#039;ve seen in Dragon Ball Super. The fight was still epic and had a lot of meaning to it, something you don&#039;t see in Dragon Ball Super. This brings me to my next point.<br />
<br />
The fights in Dragon Ball Super are complete and utter garbage. I&#039;m not just talking about the animation in the fights, but everything else about them completely suck! First lets go back to Dragon Ball Z. What made fights in Dragon Ball Z so good is the buildup to them. There was a lot of buildup in fights back then, and by the time the fights start it would have you on the edge of your seats. Goku vs Vegeta, Goku vs Frieza, Goku vs Cell, Gohan vs Cell, so many fights in DBZ are good because of the awesome buildup we get. Not only this, but there was actually meaning behind the fights, it wasn&#039;t always just mindless action. Lets take Vegeta vs Android 18 for example. This fight had much more meaning to it and wasn&#039;t just mindless action. I cant say the same about Dragon Ball Super fights. <br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super fights have no build up whatsoever, thus they aren&#039;t exciting to watch in the slightest. Dragon Ball Super fights have no deeper meaning behind them. It&#039;s just the same boring and repetitive nonsense over and over again. Lets take Beerus vs Goku for example. We have a random dude that comes out of nowhere that&#039;s capable of destroying planets. He then goes to Goku and they start to fight. No buildup whatsoever, thus the fight is fucking boring. We have Goku fight him again, this time he&#039;s a Super Saiyan God. Again, there&#039;s no buildup so there was absolutely nothing interesting about this fight. This applies to almost every other arc as well. 0 buildup in the black arc, 0 buildup in the tournament of power either. The fights are visually uninteresting and boring to watch, point blank period.<br />
<br />
Speaking about the lack of buildup, this applies to the transformations as well. The transformations in Dragon Ball Super are pure 100% garbage. There is no creativity to be found whatsoever. Super Saiyan God is just base form Goku with red hair. Ultra Instinct is just blue Kaioken. Super Saiyan Blue is just the same thing as Super Saiyan but with blue hair. It&#039;s lame and uninteresting. Even though Dragon Ball GT is noncanon, Super Saiyan 4 was much better than the garbage we see in Dragon Ball Super. At least there was some creativity in Super Saiyan 4. <br />
<br />
Also, there is no build up to these transformations whatsoever. Goku becoming a god because 5 other people give him power was absolute garbage. The introduction for Super Saiyan blue was awful as well. These transformations just come out of nowhere and there is no build up for them whatsoever. Super Saiyan 1 and 2 had beautiful introductions, but I cant say the same for the awful transformations we have in Dragon Ball Super.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s just way too many retcons and things that don&#039;t make any sense in general. For example, Vegito. It was stated in DBZ that using the potara fusion will make it so that they are permanently fused. Ok, but in Dragon Ball Super they retcon that and say that it only lasts an hour (if you&#039;re not a supreme kai). Absolutely ridiculous. Another example of bad writing, why did the Supreme Kai never tell anyone about Beerus? This makes no sense whatsoever. If there&#039;s someone out there that&#039;s that strong, then why would he never mention that? Again, bad writing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m sure we all know this, but the villains in Dragon Ball Super are complete garbage. First off we have Frieza. I used to like Frieza back in DBZ, but unfortunately this shitty anime brought him back and now I&#039;m just fucking tired of Frieza. Why cant Akira Toriyama just be original and come up with something new? Bringing back old villains like Frieza is just lazy writing. I don&#039;t think Black/Zamasu is a bad villain. I&#039;d say he&#039;s average. At least he wasn&#039;t poorly written like Golden Frieza.<br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super doesn&#039;t even have one good arc. I&#039;ve already sort of explained why the first arc is shit. A random &quot;God of Destruction&quot; appears out of nowhere and is 1000 times stronger than everyone else. He decides to destroy planet earth, but then spares them after fighting Goku. Absolute dogshit. Again, this arc was terrible because of the lack of build up. It didn&#039;t even feel like Dragon Ball, it just felt like fanfiction bullshit.<br />
<br />
There are two tournament arcs in Dragon Ball Super, just proving further that there is no creativity to be found in this anime. The Tournament of Power is hands down the shittiest arc in the series. The fights were badly animated, and just bad in general. The asspulls were absolutely ridiculous. I mentioned this before, Vegeta gets a random asspull powerup and defeats someone that&#039;s clearly stronger than him. This makes no sense whatsoever. Back in DBZ, if someone was weaker than another person, there&#039;s no way they&#039;d be able to win. It&#039;s all a matter of power levels. If you&#039;re weaker you&#039;re weaker and there&#039;s nothing you can do to win. So Vegeta asspulling his way to victory made no sense whatsoever! We get awful characters in this arc as well.<br />
<br />
Jiren is one of the worst characters in Dragon Ball history. He&#039;s worse than Yamcha, worse than Pan, worse than anyone you&#039;ve ever seen in Dragon Ball. First off, he&#039;s a lame character. He&#039;s just a boring and somehow extremely overpowered character. His backstory is ridiculously generic. There was no effort put into the making of his backstory. He constantly acts out of character. At one point he states that he seeks something further than strength. At another point he says that he wants to become the strongest ever. This made no sense, none whatsoever. Honestly, Jiren is barely even a character. I cant believe anyone actually thinks he&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Dragon Ball Super has the most ridiculous power scaling I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. I&#039;ve never seen a battle shounen that has worse power scaling than this garbage. We have characters here that train for a couple months and become Super Saiyan God level. We have fucking Krillin holding off Super Saiyan Blue Goku. That was hands down the most stupid shit I&#039;ve ever seen. We have Super Saiyan 2 Trunks holding off fucking Goku Black. We have MASTER FUCKING ROSHI fighting in the Tournament of Power arc and actually beating people up. That makes NO sense whatsoever. This is the same individual that was weaker than kid Goku.<br />
<br />
If there are any real Dragon Ball fans reading this review, remember kid Goku vs Jackie Chun? At that point, Master Roshi was already weaker than Goku. He could train his entire life and he still shouldn&#039;t be a match for ANYONE. It makes no sense!<br />
<br />
Android 17 being as strong as Goku and Vegeta was also total nonsense. That just doesn&#039;t make any sense. No matter how much training he did, he should never be able to get that strong like that. He should be like Mystic Gohans level at best. Goku and Vegeta trained with Beerus and Whis, two of the strongest people in the universe. You&#039;re telling me that 17 is as strong as two people on God level, and two people that trained with the strongest individuals in the universe? Nonsense.<br />
<br />
Real Dragon Ball fans such as myself do not support this garbage ass anime and the manga. If you&#039;re a real Dragon Ball fan you would know that it ends after Z. All that other shit is complete nonsense. <br />
<br />
So that&#039;s the end of my review. Dragon Ball Super is bottom tier shounen. It&#039;s down there with other garbage shounen such as One Piece, Fairy Tail, Seven Deadly Sins, etc. It might even be worse. This anime is a disgrace to Dragon Ball Z, and I&#039;d even argue that GT is better than this nonsense. The only reason I&#039;m giving tthis anime a 1 is because it&#039;s not possible to give it anythning below that. This anime doesn&#039;t deserve a one, it deserves a 0. Nothing was good about it, literally nothing.<br />

    At first i didn&#039;t want to write it, but...i just had to. Cant stay silent when someone butchers a legendary series with a cheap cash-grab.<br />
 Not sure where to start so..i&#039;ll start with positives, as its whole 2/10 so got to have some, right? Ok. Positives: opening. End of positives.<br />
Really. It looks ok, music isnt terrible...<br />
Problems begin when the opening ends and show starts. Its one of the ugliest series i&#039;ve seen in YEARS. It looks worse than DB, DBZ ang GT. Can&#039;t stop wondering why - dragon ball shits golden eggs for years, so i expected level of FSN: UBW, Naruto Shippuden, One Punch

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229805">
        Man and other fighting series we see nowadays. Actually, i&#039;d be happy even with the quality presented in the opening.  But this is straight bad. Characters, backgrounds, effects... everything looks cheap and amateur. Cut-scenes in DB games look better. <br />
Let&#039;s continue. Story. It&#039;s on a whole different level of bullshit than GT. First of all, its inconsistent with regular DBZ. Examples? Beerus popping out of nowhere, then its further explained that if kaioshins die, he vanishes too. Where was he when Buu was butchering kaioshins? Or in latest events of buu saga when last 2 kaioshins could be annihilated any second? OK, lets say he could pop in a second and 1shot buu...i wont even start with golden freeza, and those random characters with random abilities in tournament, the most unfitting characters in DB World. The future trunks saga is when it totally breaks any logic that was introduced in DBZ. Trunks going back in time created alternative future, events splitted. In 1 continuum goku lives, in other he&#039;s dead for good. Then how the heck this joke-of-a-kaioshin from trunks continuum got to know goku and create black in his image, if goku died of disease before anyone knew about beerus and other universes, so if he was dead i guess he couldnt visit the other universe. But fck logic, right? And more problems popup with every episode.<br />
I dont really know japanese, so cant talk about dubbing. Characters sound ok, i like beerus voiceactor. <br />
I kept watching hoping for improvement, end with each episode it was only getting worse and worse and worse and worse....i finally gave up and wont be trying it again. Better to rewatch DBZ remaster next time...

    It&#039;s a disappointment. The story is just plain out bad, you can feel when watching the anime that it&#039;s just looking for anything they can do to make it feel entertaining. They drag out unnecessary scenes over the whole episodes. <br />
<br />
They try to drag out anything to stall time so they can find a story to animate. The animation is bad, it&#039;s clean but bad. Poor camera angels mixed with poor animation and you have a dragon ball super fight. <br />
<br />
Fight scenes have nothing with them except for punching and kamehameha&#039;s. fighting choreography is close to none.  I heard that the animators for dragon

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242265">
        ball super are new to animation and is just beginning to animate. <br />
<br />
And you can see how little the creator of dragon balls care about it. Dragon balls used to be an anime like one punch man, you weren&#039;t really there for the story just more for the raw power fights. But it has really gone downhill. If you have watched all the other dragon balls and is wondering if this is worth watching, my answer to you is no. Do not watch it, it will ruin everything you liked about dragon balls<br />

    Sotry is actually very diluted in this one, so there isn&#039;t much to it and a one line spoiler for the whole first 14 episodes is easy to produce, simply because NOTHING HAPPENS most of the time. The rest of the time something almost happens and on very rare occasions something finally does actually somehow happen, miraculously considering the show is done in such a way as prevent anything from ever happening and to drag it on for all eternity.<br />

    Note: the series isn&#039;t over yet, nor will it be over for a while, but I doubt it will get any better.<br />
<br />
The story is the same rehashed garbage before. And I liked the original Dragonball manga.<br />
Also, some genius came up with the idea to make the first 29 episodes into basically recaps of the 2 movies that were recently released. Genius.<br />
<br />
The animation can suck my Virginia for all I care. It&#039;s garbage. All of it. The characters look different throughout every frame. The original anime series had their issues, but at least the characters were somewhat consistent throughout.<br />
<br />
The sound&#039;s saving grace are the classic DB

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221575">
        sound effects that are sometimes reused. Also, some of the music is &#039;kay. <br />
<br />
At least they got the same voice cast. The characters are still interesting, but Gohan is still a little chump.<br />
<br />
Also, why did they have filler episodes in an anime original series? Because they needed time to get key animation done? Well, that&#039;d be great, if the animation EVER looked good (SPOILERS: it doesn&#039;t).<br />
<br />
Overall, garbage series which has ruined a beloved classic of mine. The manga is pretty chill doh, even though it has 20 pages a month.

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Review in English and Spanish/Reseña en ingles y español.<br />
<br />
Review of all Dragon Ball Super up to chapter 131<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s go in parts, EVERYTHING DBS does is wrong.<br />
They started adapting the 2 movies, although supposedly it was to correct mistakes, but in both they put events like that of Tagoma (I think that&#039;s what it was called), leaving him alive, with a pseudo motivation so that later Ginyu will arrive and steal the body and equal Ginyu Dies, making all this irrelevant, there were scenes in the film that lasted with 5 minutes and the series extended them to 2 chapters, being that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review234704">
        1 film can be summarized in up to 4 chapters.<br />
The bow of the tournament seemed to me the worst of all, leaving aside that you do a tournament with 2 guys who have the power of a god, wasted all the others, Piccolo valued cock with a strategy stupid, being that in Z type If he thought well, Gohan had said that he would train and here he does not appear, Majin Buu, bone, be extremely strong and leave with a nonsense that can not enter because he can not write ... Equal Vegeta and Goku beat everyone, 5 vs 5 something very strange or unnecessary, then this Frost, conveniently showed us that he is a good subject and such nonsense, being that in the previous fight did not do the same with Botamo, but hey, then it turns out he is bad and I do not know what . Hit, the kind of 1000-year-old who can stop time, who overcomes the power of Goku and Vegeta, being both have the power of the gods (and included in a higher phase), the god level is so mediocre that it can be reached And overcome by anyone? And worst of all, the Kaioken * 10, with that mother should have killed Hit by just touching it, but no, and even loses ... Then comes the twist comic plot with Monaka and Bills also fulfilling the desire of Champa, Making the whole saga a nonsense.<br />
In the saga of black the most salient are that they went all over the ass with powers, like Black saying that because he has the body of a Saiyan he gets stronger every time he fights, but Genkai saiyan works only when they hurt you Gravity and you recover and not of cina you will raise the power of a ssj1 to that of a ssjdssj, Trunks and its deus ex machina supreme, first holding battles with Black and Zamasu, being that both gave to a pump to Goku and Vegeta in mode Blue, then acquiring an aura similar to that of the gods because I do not know, his sword resists a chingo (Although of course, in Z his sword could cut Freezer, the most powerful race at the time, but not 2 humans with part Robotic), it is obvious that Vegetto was just to attract more publicity and it&#039;s okay, I would not care so much if they did not leave the pothara union as worthy dick as the dance, all that was a Plot Device for which Trunks (which inexplicably Said that he would defeat Zamasu, being that Vegetto at that moment was giving him a slap), then generates that &quot;Genkidama&quot; with energy of the earth and a population fucking REDUCED (With energy of Goku and Vegetas done shit and in base mode), Being that to kill Buu was necessary a Genkidama universal and equal Buu resisted, it does not make sense that Zamasu to die so easy, but GOD EX MACHINA + GARY STU = Trunks. Many say that humans guided their energy and hope to Trunks and so they did not raise their hands, well, when they learned to master / control their Ki? One very important thing would be that Vegetto in ssjdssj should destroy the earth with the shock wave in one fell swoop, is a fucking OP character, but when he launches the Final Kamehameha the UNIVERSE should have been worth dick, but nothing happens to the earth. Previously they made the conveniences subtle, but now everyone noticed (Although good, 80% of fans complain about the duration of the merger, this being the least important compared to all other inconsistencies in the chapter). Trunks defeated Cell and the Androids &quot;Yes, because I TRAIN quite and its power was not so far from an inperfecto cell or the androids. It might be good that Trunks will defeat Zamasu but not with something so forced.<br />
<br />
This saga in specific was to attract more public, I know several people who did not see DBS but started to see this saga, Akira should be counting his money while laughing at his fans.<br />
<br />
Dbz also had very stupid mistakes, mainly in the saga of the androids and cell, but they were more subtle, DBS is so bad that even the PLEBS can notice that everything is wrong.<br />
<br />
This last arc improved a little bit, since from the beginning there was a change in the color palette that made it no longer look all stiff and was more pleasing to the eye.<br />
One of the most notorious things about the tournament is the lack of originality in the characters, not only in design but also in skills, almost everything was reduced to hits instead of strategies or even interesting techniques.<br />
Roshi, Krillin and Tenshinhan have their own chapters where they are given a little time on screen, Roshi being the most interesting and Tenshinhan the most boring.<br />
It is impossible not to notice the stupidities of the writers when supposedly important things happen, for example, when Frost was going to eliminate Roshi, Goku was like an idiot screaming and could not escape ... The guy is a god and to top it off he has teleportation ! This happens very often.<br />
A very annoying thing is the emotional manipulation to eliminate a universe that we know absolutely nothing (literally), put phrases and sad melodies, being that they did not have the ability to make us care as spectators.<br />
Only one universe behaved credibly by being eliminated, acting scared and desperately trying not to be eliminated.<br />
Saiyan girls are one of the worst things in the franchise, being a Mary Sue full-fledged, acquiring powers removed from the ass and extremely stupid transformations (Broly, WITHOUT SENSE) to then carry out the fusion Pothara that seemed to be even stronger that Vegetto.<br />
Hit is eliminated for being stupid.<br />
Vegeta takes a meaningless transformation out of his ass for a super cheap drama that even he does not believe himself.<br />
Hit and his past 3 minutes of unnecessary exposure are something that is not even worth talking about.<br />
Ultra instinct, ultra improved instinct, ultra Jiren instinct, all are power ups taken from the ass.<br />
The end with 17 reviving all the universes was too predictable but it&#039;s funny to see how it arrives 18 and says &quot;But 17, and you travel with your family?&quot; Dialogues so stupid that break the immersion.<br />
Frieza the revived and apparently continue the story with the Resurrection of Frieza 4.0.<br />
<br />
In general, the first two arcs are the movies made even worse and unnecessarily lengthened, the first tournament of universes is a nonsense for that horrible final and has too many power ups nonsense that even they respect, the saga of Black is undoubtedly the worst , having 10 inconsistencies with Z and even with the same Super per chapter and the tournament improving a little but without being something remarkable.<br />
Animation of shit carried by animators who seem not to strive, there were only a few caps where there really was fluency and good drawing.<br />
The OST is not particularly noteworthy but has a good track record.<br />
The choreography of combat is terrible, showing only one or two planes, reducing everything to blow hit with limited animation, to be a shounen of fights this is very bad.<br />
Was not this supposed to show what happened to reach the epilogue of Z?<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Reseña de todo Dragon Ball Super hasta el capitulo 131<br />
Vayamos por partes porque todo en Dbs es un error.<br />
Dbs inicio con rehacer las películas, supuestamente para corregir fallos, pero en ambas ponen sucesos como lo e Tagoma (creo que así se llamaba), dejándolo vivo, con una pseudo motivación para que luego llegará Ginyu y se robara el cuerpo e igual Ginyu muere, haciendo todo esto irrelevante, había escenas en la película que duraba con 5 minutos y la serie los alargo hasta a 2 capítulos, siendo que 1 película se puede resumir hasta en 4 capítulos.<br />
El arco del torneo me parecía el peor de todos, dejando de lado que hagas un torneo con 2 tipos que tienen el poder de un dios, desaprovecharon a todos los demás, Piccolo valiendo verga con una estrategia bien pendeja, siendo que en Z el tipo si pensaba bien, Gohan había dicho que entrenaría y aquí ni aparece, Majin Buu, osea, pinche ser extremadamente fuerte y salen con una tontería de que no puede entrar porque no sabe escribir... Igual Vegeta y Goku vencen a todos, haciendo el 5 vs 5 algo muy extraño o innecesario, luego esta Frost, convenientemente nos mostraron que es un buen sujeto y esas tonterías, siendo que en la pelea anterior no hicieron lo mismo con Botamo, pero bueno, luego resulta que es malo y no sé qué. Hit, el tipo de 1000 años que puede detener el tiempo, que supera el poder de Goku y Vegeta, siendo que ambos tienen el poder de los dioses (e inclusos en una fase superior), el nivel dios es tan mediocre que puede ser alcanzado y superado por cualquiera? Y lo peor de todo, el Kaioken*10, con esa madre debería de haber matado a Hit con solo tocarlo, pero no, e incluso pierde... Luego llega el plot twist cómico con Monaka y a Bills cumpliendo igualmente el deseo de Champa, haciendo a toda la saga con un DESPROPOSITO.<br />
En la saga de black lo mas resaltable son que se pasaron todo por el culo con los poderes, como Black diciendo que porque tiene el cuerpo de una Saiyan se hace mas fuerte cada vez que pelea, pero el Genkai saiyan funciona solo cuando te hieren de gravedad y te recuperas y ni de coña te subirá el poder de un ssj1 a el de un ssjdssj, Trunks y sus deus ex machina supremos, primero sosteniendo batallas con Black y Zamasu, siendo que ambos le dieron una putiza a Goku y Vegeta en modo azul, luego adquiriendo un aura similar a la de los dioses porque Yo No Sé, su espada resiste un chingo (Aunque claro, en Z su espada podía cortar a Freezer, la raza mas poderosa en su momento, pero no a 2 humanos con partes roboticas), es obvio que lo de Vegetto fue solo para atraer mas publico y esta bien, no me importaría tanto si no dejaran a la unión pothara tan vale verga como la danza, todo eso fue un Plot Device para que Trunks (El cual inexplicablemente dijo que derrotaría a Zamasu, siendo que Vegetto en esos momentos le estaba dando una putiza), luego genera esa &quot;Genkidama&quot; con energía de la tierra y una población jodidamente REDUCIDA (Con energía de Goku y Vegetas hechos mierda y en modo base), siendo que para matar a Buu fue necesaria una Genkidama universal e igual Buu se resistió, no tiene sentido que Zamasu muera tan fácil, peeeeeeeero DEUS EX MACHINA+GARY STU=Trunks. Muchos dicen que los humanos guiaron su energía y esperanza hacia Trunks y por eso no levantaron sus manos, bien, cuando aprendieron a dominar/controlar su Ki? Una cosa muy importante seria que Vegetto en ssjdssj debería de destruir la tierra con la onda expansiva de un solo golpe, es un personaje jodidamente OP, pero cuando lanza el Final Kamehameha el UNIVERSO debió valer verga, pero a la tierra no le pasa nada... Anteriormente hacían las conveniencias medio sutiles, pero ahora todos lo notaron (Aunque bueno, el 80% de los fans se quejan de la duración de la fusión, siendo esto lo menos importante a comparación con todas las demás incoherencias del capitulo) &quot;El futuro debe ser arreglado por alguien de ese futuro, por eso Trunks derroto a Cell y a los Androides&quot; Si, porque ENTRENO bastante y su poder no estaba tan alejado de un cell imperfecto o los androides. Pudo ser bueno que Trunks derrotará a Zamasu pero no con algo tan forzado.<br />
Esta saga en especifico fue para atraer a mas publico, aunque todo lo que trajo son PLEBS y elitistas a los que les dan un muy buen material para echarle mierda.<br />
<br />
Este ultimo arco mejoró un poquito, ya desde el principio se vio un cambio en la paleta de colores que hacia que ya no se viera todo acartonado y era mas agradable a la vista.<br />
Una de las cosas mas notorias del torneo es la falta de originalidad en los personajes, no solo en diseño sino también en habilidades, casi todo se reducía a golpes en lugar de estrategias o técnicas siquiera interesantes.<br />
Roshi, Krillin y Tenshinhan tienen sus propios capítulos donde se les da un poco de tiempo en pantalla, siendo Roshi el mas interesante y Tenshinhan el mas aburrido.<br />
Es imposible no notar las estupideces de los escritores cuando pasan cosas supuestamente importantes, por ejemplo, cuando Frost iba a eliminar a Roshi, Goku estuvo como idiota gritando y según no podía escapar... El tipo es un dios y para colmo tiene la teletransportación! Esto ocurre muy seguido.<br />
Una cosa muy molesta es la manipulación emocional al eliminar a un universo del que no conocemos absolutamente nada (literalmente), ponen frases y melodías tristes, siendo que no tuvieron la capacidad de hacer que nos importe como espectadores.<br />
Solo un universo se comportó de una manera creíble al ser eliminado, actuando asustados y tratando desesperadamente de que no los eliminaran.<br />
Las niñas Saiyan son una de las peores cosas de la franquicia, siendo unas Mary Sue hechas y derechas, adquiriendo poderes sacados del culo y transformaciones sumamente estúpidas (Broly, SINSENTIDO) para luego llevar a cabo la fusión Pothara que parecía ser incluso mas fuerte que Vegetto.<br />
Hit es eliminado por ser un estúpido.<br />
Vegeta se saca del culo una transformación sin sentido por un drama super barato que ni él mismo se cree.<br />
Hit y su pasado de 3 minutos de exposición innecesaria son algo de lo que ni siquiera vale la pena hablar.<br />
Ultra instinto, ultra instinto mejorado, ultra instinto de Jiren, todos son power ups sacados del culo.<br />
El final con 17 reviviendo a todos los universos era demasiado predecible pero da gracia ver como llega 18 y dice &quot;Pero 17, y tu viajo con tu familia?&quot; Diálogos tan pendejos que rompen la inmersión.<br />
Freezer el revivido y aparentemente continuará la historia con la Resurrección de Freezer 4.0.<br />
<br />
En general, los dos primeros arcos son las películas hechas aun peor y alargada innecesariamente, el primer torneo de universos es un despropósito por ese horrendo final y tiene demasiados power ups sinsentido que ni ellos mismos respetan, la saga de Black es sin duda la peor, teniendo 10 incoherencias con Z e incluso con el mismo Super por capitulo y el torneo mejorando un poquito pero sin ser algo destacable.<br />
Animación de mierda llevada por animadores que parecen no esforzarse, solo hubo unos pocos caps donde realmente hubo fluidez y buen dibujo.<br />
El OST no es particularmente destacable pero tiene una que otra buena pista.<br />
La coreografía de combate es pésima, mostrando solo uno o dos planos, reduciendo todo a golpe golpe con animación limitada, para ser un shounen de peleas esto es muy malo.<br />
¿No se suponía que esto era para mostrar lo que paso para llegar al epilogo de Z?
