    Scrapped Princess has been a show sitting on my shelf for quite a while and for some reason I had never gotten around to viewing it.  For that I am rather disappointed in myself as it turned out to be a wonderfully entertaining and charming series.<br />
<br />
When starting the show you will be treated to what is seemingly your normal medieval era sword and sorcery fantasy adventure.  And for the first half of the series that is exactly what you get.  The second half in some ways almost feels like a completely separate show as mecha like combat starts to replace your standard

        swords and magic fighting.  I imagine some people who are expecting a more traditional kind of adventure might feel a bit disappointed but I thought the transition was logical and seamless.  Pacifica, known as the Scrapped Princess is on the run with her two older siblings because everyone wants her dead as she is prophesied to destroy the world on her 16th birthday.  Of course it will become obvious to the assassins sent after her and the viewers that she is nothing but a sweet girl who poses no threat to anyone.  The plot moves along fairly slowly but the pace was quick enough that I never got bored with it.  A number of interesting twists emerge, some predictable others not so much but all and all I found the mix of the old and modern technology quite fresh and original.  The action and special effects are quite good but my one complaint with it is that towards the end it does feel like it drags on for a few episodes with little really going on.  The ending was also pretty solid and I felt very satisfied with how many of the storylines wrapped up.<br />
<br />
Pacifica shines as the main protagonist of Scrapped Princess.  She is a very likable and character and I think most people will find it very easy to relate with her.  Rounding out the rest of the main cast is the siblings and Pacifica&#039;s guardians, Shannon and Raquel.  They were very fun characters and I liked them both a lot.  Unfortunately we didn’t ever get that much back story on either of them.  Things were hinted at with them both but I was left feeling a little let down that these were not better developed.  The supporting cast is also very strong as several characters shine, particularly Leo, but others feel a bit flat and stereotypical.<br />
<br />
The music was very good.  Both the opening and ending songs felt very appropriate and set the tone of the series.  Voice acting is also very strong.  Do to some issues I had with the subtitle timing on my DVDs, I was unfortunately exposed to the English dub of this show for an episode before I couldn’t take it anymore and had to download the corrupted episodes online.  Honestly I don’t know how or why people watch English dubs, particularly from Bang Zoom! who has some of the worst actors in the industry.  Why do I always feel like you’re trying to hard when you speak?  Just talk normally, you don’t have to talk like your trying to be 12 years old.  Just stay away from the dub.  Remember: friends don’t let friends watch dubbed anime.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite elements of SP, is the artwork and animation.  The backgrounds and spell effects were beautiful.  The character designs were truly exceptional though.  The girls were all adorable and the guys were handsome and manly and bishounen free.  Some of the girls bosoms were a bit out of hand though, particularly Winia&#039;s.  Those looked like they might get in the way.<br />
<br />
Overall I am left with a very favorable view of this anime.  A satisfying ending, great characters, I am sad to see this one end.  The story feels very original and delivers a unique cautionary tale about mankind and his struggles to not destroy himself.<br />

    Overall/Enjoyment:<br />
As you can see, I really liked Scrapped Princess. It&#039;s a familiar song played to a different tune. The way it starts off gives the appearance of being slow and uneventful, but it all depends on your point of view. The action is light, and it builds up gradually to some pretty big battles as the story progresses, but what the show may lack in action it makes up for with some really potent drama. In this way it excels beyond the usual sword and sorcery fare. If you prefer the myth and the magic over character dynamics then this may seem dull and ordinary

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8728">
        to you. I enjoy stories about escalating climactic battles, but life isn&#039;t always an epic series of conflicts, so stories like this are nice as well.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story of the Scrapped Princess is one of prophecy and death, and it never lets you forget that. There&#039;s always an essence of tragedy and suffering looming in the air. There are moments of endearment and playfulness mixed in with those of doom and gloom. So on the surface it may appear to be just another medieval adventure, but beneath it lies an emotional one as well.<br />
<br />
Sure there&#039;s the occasional sword fight or spell casting or sci-fi tangent (there&#039;s even some mech-like things), which are interesting on their own, but what I found myself instantly drawn to were the characters. Even though in the beginning I could tell the action was pretty low key, I was still no less interested in watching more. There was an allure not so much in what they were doing, but how they were going about it. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a very well written story. The character&#039;s are surprised when they are supposed to be, they&#039;re not omniscient and are often ignorant of knowledge the viewer already has. Events and precedents are recalled correctly so there&#039;s no plot holes. There are no real loose ends to speak of and the ending is solid. There&#039;s plenty of good humor, romance, and really touching moments. It&#039;s one of those stories where there&#039;s a big world of big burdens and a decisive destiny waiting for them at the end, but it&#039;s the journey itself and the little things inbetween I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
The only flaw, if I had to pick any, I could see was that the whole Peacemaker angle was never explained too clearly or thoroughly. This leads to an ending that&#039;s wrapped up just a tad too neatly/ideally for my taste. In fact, I&#039;d say the whole sci-fi thing probably hurt the series more than helped. It could&#039;ve done just fine without it. I would&#039;ve liked a little more definitive clarification on how things got to the way they were, and some kind of indication of where they were going to go from there (such as what happens with magic?).<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Given the kind of story this is, I think you get a pretty good feel for the characters, though none quite as well as Pacifica and Shannon. Everyone else are just supporting characters by comparison. Still, characters are fleshed out fairly well. Even if you don&#039;t particularly like a character, you get some kind of sense of who they are. Not just in actions, but how they feel and think.<br />
<br />
People are not one-dimensional automatons programmed with a set of unshakable and predictable reactions. They have moments of fear, doubt, impulsiveness, and weakness. It&#039;s essential to establish these things as well for any story to have any semblance of authenticity. Some of the extra characters may not have been necessary but I think Scra-Prin did a good job anyway. No one was particularly overpowered or unbelievable, and the main character&#039;s &amp;quot;spoiled innocence&amp;quot; lent itself well to this story.<br />
<br />
The one oddity I would say is that the Winia character looked bizarrely identical to the Senes one. Were they related or did the character designer reach his creative limit?<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I really like BONES art. Their shows are always vibrant and colorful, their lines are sharp and clean, the character/outfit designs are beautiful, the backgrounds are lush and the animation is always fluid. I guess it may seem pretty &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; by modern standards, but I&#039;d still say they&#039;re my favorite to date.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Well, although no particular tune comes to mind, I&#039;d say as far as setting the mood and tone are concerned, the music was always right. There were never any odd moments of silence and when a scene called for action or suspense there was always the appropriate music to accompany it. I thought the dubbing was pretty good, which is not a compliment to take lightly as I&#039;m pretty critical about, well, everything, but especially dubbing. The subtitles on the other hand were littered with spelling/grammar errors.<br />
<br />
Other:<br />
Scrapped Princess is a rather misleading title. As a show it doesn&#039;t sound quite right, and it&#039;s certainly an awkward way to keep addressing someone. That is, it makes about as much sense as calling her the &amp;quot;Killed Princess&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Trapped Princess&amp;quot;. Perhaps Cursed or Forsaken would&#039;ve been more appropriate, though certainly less original.<br />
<br />
This show was kind of strange for me because it had the flair of Fullmetal Alchemist and the heart of Eureka 7, but wasn&#039;t as good as either of them in those regards. However, I would say it had the more complete ending of the three.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure why, but in the world of Scra-Prin the average woman is very.... voluptuous, that or they are wearing some of the most form fitting clothing ever made. This is either a statement about the lack of bras in medieval times, or that women in our future will be very well endowed. <br />
<br />

    Scrapped Princess is a quite interesting genre mix...in the beginning it is a fantasy world which gradually gets a few sf touches. This adds a nice touch to a story which is quite logical (if somewhat predictable) and has a satisfying ending.<br /><br />The animation is quite average – nothing to complain about…a bit boring at times. Nice character designs even for some of the supporting roles.<br />Sound – the ending theme caught my interest, nice arrangement, a bit different. The beginning suited the series and the score was fitting too, although nothing that stuck longer.<br /><br />Now, the characters are one of the strong points of this anime…I somewhat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23">
        came to like them…even Parcifia who can be a bit annoying sometimes with her: “Perhaps it’s better when I die” attitude. This aspect is just a bit to heavy. The development of some of the protagonists (especially Shannon, my personal favourite^^) is consistant; their dilemma and how they cope with problems is interesting and understandable.<br /><br />Looking at this it is quite clear that I enjoyed it…it’s sad that this anime just couldn’t reach far enough to be truly amazing…but still a recommendable series.<br />

    Never seen another anime quite like this one, there are so many surprises thats it&#039;s unpredictable but not in a stupid fashion. It has a bit of everything, romance, war, parent/ child love, magic, sword play, memorable funny scenes and mecha, yep thats right, MECHA.<br />
<br />
But for those of you who hate mecha anime, dont go just yet, cuase the anime&#039;s not heavily based on mecha, but more on the story (you&#039;ll understand why mecha was used in the end). The fanstasy land that the story is set is akin to animes such as Full metal alchemist or naurto, a mix of science and medievil theme.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3878">
        Animation is average  but enjoyable and some pretty nice music.<br />
<br />
It has a cool storyline where you&#039;ve basically got this princess who everyone hates and is protected by her elite brother sister pair. It keeps you interested becuase you want to know why she is hated and called the &amp;quot;scrapped princess&amp;quot; and the surprises that the story line chucks at you kepted me excited :D.<br />
<br />
However, the main heros are your aveage cool brother whos pretty good with a sword and your typical princess who knows she has to die but puts on a brave face and enjoys life to the max but some of the scenes cracked me up big time.<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed Full metal alchemist i think you&#039;ll find this anime to your taste as both are set in a similar sort of world and both are series yet funny at the same time. Enjoy :D

    Scrapped Princess is an anime that&#039;s been overshadowed by many of the shows that have been released this past decade. Just because it&#039;s underrated doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s not good. In fact, it&#039;s quite the opposite.<br />
<br />
        The story of Scrapped Princess is very RPG-inspired; gamers who are familiar with the genre will feel right at home with this anime. The first half of the series is light-hearted, dedicating its episodes to introducing the characters and establishing the main plot. The second half of the series is much darker, with plot twists and turns every so often, character developments,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11359">
        and in-depth looks at the villains&#039; schemes. As I watched it, I couldn&#039;t help but feel that I was playing an above-standard RPG. Don&#039;t let that distract you from the experience, though. Not only does the story take place in a world of its own, but little clues are planted here and there in the dialogue to establish the period of time it takes place. They&#039;re kind of hard to miss. All the characters are pretty much likable, despite their flaws. Overtime, they start to grow on to you, making some of the major moments of the series more memorable. The story, overall, is well paced and brings everything together into one satisfying conclusion.<br />
<br />
       The art is what one would come to expect from BONES studios (Fullmetal Alchemist, Ouran High School Host Club, Soul Eater). The colors are vibrant and the character designs cheerful and, in some cases, cute. They work well for the first half of the series, but at first, feel out of place during the series&#039; apocalyptic second half; You tend to get used to them after a while. The animation shines during the action and fight scenes, but when the scene is simple, such as a conversation between two characters, the animation tends to be a bit stoic except for some wind blowing. This issue only occurs for several episodes, though. The positive side of that is that the animators are focused more on making this series look beautiful, which they have accomplished. The art in Scrapped Princess is truly a feast for the eyes.<br />
<br />
      The audio in this anime didn&#039;t really shine as much as I expected it to. The soundtrack overall isn&#039;t memorable, but the orchestral compositions soar during the more climatic moments of the series. The music is fitting, but it doesn&#039;t make me want to go buy the soundtrack. The series&#039; opening theme &quot;Little Wing&quot; by JAM Project has a nice Celtic-inspired intro that quickly makes the transition into an upbeat Pop/Rock song (with vocals provided by Masumi Okui). The song is all right as an intro to this series, but the song itself is good. It&#039;s one of those songs that grows on you. Same with the series&#039; ending, &quot;Daichi no la-li-la&quot; by Yoko Ueno and Masumi Itou. The brass at the beginning of the song makes it seem old fashioned, but then this song proves that this is no ordinary J-pop song. The singers&#039; canons fit well into the song (and it&#039;s darn catchy too!) and the song itself fits the fantasy/adventure fell of the show well. I watched the English dub of the series, and I was once again impressed at the effort put forth by Bang Zoom! Entertainment to make this dub sound good. This show has an all-star cast, starring voice actors such as Kari Wahlgren (Pacifica Cassul), Crispin Freeman (Shannon Cassul), and Steve Blum (Luke Storm). They each took their roles and made them their own. At times I felt like I wasn&#039;t even watching a dub of a show from Japan. The dub has to be one of the best parts of the show.<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess is one of the most pleasant surprises I&#039;ve seen in a long time. I really wasn&#039;t expecting much from the show, but I really enjoyed it. If you&#039;re not satisfied with any anime you&#039;re currently watching, give Scrapped Princess a try. I guarantee you that it will not disappoint.

    This is one of those anime taking place in older times, with knights and a medieval stuff, for a while anyway.<br />
<br />
This show has a relatively slow moving plot, but once it picks up, you really start to get interested in it.  I will admit though, even once it picks up, the plot still moves slow, but its the interesting things that happen that keep you wanting to watch more, and trust me, the ending is pretty sweet and worth watching.<br />
<br />
The magic is pretty cool and the &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot; have some pretty unique talents that make battle scenes pretty fun to watch.  there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5340">
        plenty of sword/physical fighting as well as magic and dragons to balance it out.  <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty interesting, although i have to say the secondary characters are more often than not more interesting than the main, even though the main characters is supposed to be wrapped in mystery.  All the characters grow on you, and they balance out pretty well with each other.<br />
<br />
The art work is done well for a medieval setting, and although some of the characters are lacking in the fresh look department, others more than make up for it.  <br />
<br />
Overall enjoyable series.  I&#039;ve only seen the dub which wasn&#039;t too bad, but the sub is probably better so watch that one if you can.

    The thing about the fantasy genre is that, as far as I’ve picked up, a large focus is put on creating a fantastical world that the characters inhabit. There are numerous ways to go about this, whether it’s focusing a lot on the magical aspect of the world versus blending the fantasy elements with science fiction, or letting the audience know very little and have them figure out the history of the setting themselves versus letting them in on every little detail, or something else entirely. Scrapped Princess takes all of the wrong turns when it comes to this, but more of that later.<br />
<br />
The synopsis

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106013">
        for the anime you can find up there, so I won’t bother with it. Instead I’ll focus on what I liked or didn’t like about the show.<br />
<br />
In terms of production Scrapped Princess does alright. The visuals are nothing too fancy, which one might find strange since it’s made by Bones right after they made Wolf’s Rain and right before they made the original Fullmetal Alchemist. Point is, it doesn’t look impressive, but it looks okay. The same can be said about the music; nothing outstanding, but alright. In fact what I like the most are the character designs and more specifically the costume designs. Bones have a thing for character designs, and it really goes to show. I don’t know why everybody is wearing shoulder pads, but I like it.<br />
<br />
The characters are, to put it simply, fun. Most of them are incredibly shallow, and much of their internal conflicts can be seen as a bit dull. There is development, mind you, but we never know anything about the characters for better or for worse. The good thing is we get to see them here and now and how they change as the story goes along. The bad thing is we can’t sympathize with them well. More than anything the characters bounce off each other really well, and they make up for their lack of depth in interaction with other characters.<br />
<br />
But where does this anime fall really flat, then? As I stated before, Scrapped Princess takes all the wrong turns in creating a mysterious and fantastical fantasy world – something I absolutely love. I have this idea of fantasy worlds that you have to immerse yourself into it, preferably by questioning the mechanics behind it and figuring out how everything works out by yourself. Scrapped Princess doesn’t allow you to do so. Scrapped Princess is filled with so much expositioning you can’t help but ask if it’s trying to insult your intelligence. “Now it’s time to explain this thing,” “Here’s an explaination of that explaination,” “Here’s an explaination of what we just talked about,” “Here’s a thing that can do this, now let me remind you that we still have that thing and it can still do everything we know it can do, just in case you forgot.” But why is this a bad thing? Because you can never be fully immersed in the world the anime tries to create. Every time you think of a question the series answers it within five minutes, along with giving you many more answers that completely kills the wonders of the setting. You can never immerse yourself into the world because there is nothing to grab hold of your interests – all of your questions have been answered, so why should you? Is this bad storytelling? Yes, because it doesn’t view the audience as an entity capable of free thought, a person who is able to pick up small clues and use them later when they’re needed to answer a question – and the audience has to do this on their own, I might add.<br />
<br />
All in all Scrapped Princess had potential but ultimately fails under its own ambitions. It’s still enjoyable enough though, and it does have a set of fun characters that are fun enough to watch on their own. This is one of those “I’ve seen it just for the sake of having seen it” titles.<br />

    Join the &quot;Scrapped Princess&quot; Pacifica, her wise-cracking brother Shannon, and her sweet, innocent, yet dangerously powerful sister Raquel on their covert journey to find safe haven.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
While Scrapped Princess has what can be called a traditional story, it takes some very untraditional twists and turns. There is a lot of emotion here as we watch Pacifica buckle under the pressure of having this existence thrust upon her, being hunted down like an animal for reasons she is not even certain of.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Animation: 8/10<br />
Scrapped Princess was animated by Bones, so it goes without saying that it looks beautiful. Though the show is a bit older

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187711">
        than the similar-looking Fullmetal Alchemist¸Scrapped Princess far exceeds it in terms of animation and artwork. There are no &quot;soft-spots&quot; where the animators were slacking off. Every episode looks as beautiful as the last, and even as it approaches 13 years mark, it still remains one of the more beautiful TV animes I have seen.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Composer Hikaru Nanase (Noein, Zone of the Enders, Gravion) provides her usual fare; a very competent, sweeping, and fitting orchestral soundtrack. There are quite a few standout pieces here and there, and overall, the music encapsulates the scenery very well, but some of it is much the same of what you would expect in your average RPG video game rather than series such as this. The opening and ending themes for the show are very fitting, with a nice Celtic vibe and especially with the latter, beautifully sung lyrics.<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The interactions between Pacifica and the other characters are very sincere, and are the centerpiece of the show. In particular are some of the more candid moments between Pacifica and Shannon, whom are easily the two most well-constructed characters in the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
As a high fantasy fan, I really enjoyed the show, even though I admit it has slow moving plot, theres always something interesting happening that keep you to continue watching it, Heck I&#039;ve watched this series 3 times already both in Dubbed and Subbed versions, While there is nothing wrong with the Japanese voice cast, the English voice acting in Scrapped Princess is some of the finest voice work I have ever heard.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
What you have here is an excellent show with excellent pacing and excellent writing. Not only is it one of the finest examples of a fantasy anime, it is one of the best I have ever seen in all my years of anime watching. There is a perfect balance between drama and comedy, and the transitions between the two are smooth and well-executed. If you have any love for shows like The Slayers or Lodoss, Scrapped Princess is an absolute must-see. Even if not, Scrapped Princess is more than worth a look.

    Scrapped Princess was one of those series where I got to that point that it&#039;s hard to stop watching. I&#039;d just be thinking &amp;quot;I&#039;ll just watch another episode, what&#039;s one more? I gotta see what happens next&amp;quot;.  <br />
<br />
The series is set is medieval times with the obligatory magic and dragons, however the world is post-apocalyptic in certain ways allowing some technology to still be available. I won&#039;t go into any plot spoiling details there. Anyway the Scrapped Princess (which means abandoned princess BTW, such a strange title), is believed by the religious leaders to bring about chaos and destruction to the world on her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6394">
        sixteenth birthday, so basically everyone wants her dead. So the series tracks the princess as she avoids her pursuers and makes friends and comrades along the way. <br />
<br />
Aside from getting a big load of plot dropped in your lap around the middle of the series spanning a couple of episodes, the pacing was very good. Also there are a few emotional moments in the series where you really feel for the characters. All and all I&#039;d recommend this series to those of you who enjoy a good fantasy adventure.

    One of the first characters introduced in Scrapped Princess is Leo, a naive, incompetent knight wannabe.  He&#039;s annoying right away, but mercifully his role diminishes after a few episodes.  The action picks up, the sci-fi world details become intriguing, and things start to look up.  Based on the other reviews here, I figured that I&#039;d made it through the &amp;quot;slow start&amp;quot; and could settle back to enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as the series progresses, Leo returns to prominence, and two other main characters sink to his level.  Shannon, the princess&#039;s brother, takes willfully stupid and rash actions, at odds with his &amp;quot;protector&amp;quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6726">
        character archetype.  The princess herself is revealed as a spoiled brat obsessed with baths, clothes, and perfectly cooked eggs, who won&#039;t fight and won&#039;t even expend any effort trying to understand the role she&#039;s been given.  It becomes impossible to root for her because she doesn&#039;t even try.<br />
<br />
If you watch the first couple of episodes and find Leo tolerable or even charming, then you&#039;ll probably enjoy the series.  If you hate his guts like I did, save your time and move on, because you&#039;ll probably end up hating everybody else, too.<br />

    This entry has a severe shortage of negative reviews on both MAL and Anidb, so I&#039;ll contribute my opinion to keep people like me from wasting their time with these 24 episodes. <br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess is about Pacifica, a princess who is prophesized by this world&#039;s religion to destroy the world when she turns 16. As such, she was abandoned as a baby by the king and found by a family who have been guarding her for her entire life. <br />
<br />
As a thematically focused series, Scrapped Princess fails on every account, but that will take time and spoilers to explain so I&#039;ll comment on more its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review398859">
        more basic aspects first. The plot meanders too much in Pacifica&#039;s episodic travels and has large exposition dumps that diffuse all of the mystery in its setting at once. The places where the plot meanders is also used to introduce characters that react to Pacifica&#039;s status as the scrapped princess. However nearly all the characters have bland personalities and backstories that aren&#039;t worked on enough for you to care for them. They also all turn out the same way; they see Pacifica and decide that such a nice girl can&#039;t possibly destroy the world so they defy religious prophecy and the government. From what I can tell it seems like their further desire to risk their lives to protect her is mainly motivated by their observance of Pacifica&#039;s character but the problem is that Pacifica herself doesn&#039;t have the charisma or magnetism to pull that off. The other thing that the plot tries to do is constantly remind you of Pacifica&#039;s angst owing to her position as well as the strong bond between her and her guardians, Shannon and Raquel, which gets trite. <br />
<br />
Yet for all her angst, Pacifica is not an active character. Her guardians do all the work and later when they get separated she instantly finds a stranger that takes care of her and protects her, so that she&#039;s generally shown living a comfortable life. She never has to fight her own battles or be the main source of income. She cooks but she&#039;s bad at it. When she does laundry she makes her guardians do it too. Despite this she spends half of her screen time complaining to her guardians about being tired and hungry and generally acting like a pampered princess. After 24 episodes of getting cocooned by her guardians and allies that she somehow charismatically attracted, she&#039;s given a choice that would change the fate of the world. <br />
<br />
The major reason why I can see people being absorbed by this series is because it utilizes a lot of emotional porn. Pacifica will angst by feeling guilty about being the scrapped princess despite it clearly not being her fault and despite being told that the prophecy is wrong repeatedly. And as I said, this angst is overblown when she constantly has people protecting her from physical harm, and she&#039;s never had to suffer much from self esteem issues caused by the world because she was raised in a loving family and is fed constant emotional support from her siblings and allies. In fact, she&#039;s shown to have an almost narcisstic bend to her; she beats up artists who don&#039;t draw her in a flattering way, glares at people for not liking her cooking, and says a guy is out of her league when he asks her out. Shannon&#039;s desire to protect her against the world at all costs is repeatedly emphasized so you can take in the emotional beauty of such a dynamic, but doing this doesn&#039;t reveal anything we didn&#039;t already know about the characters from the first episode. To keep this going, <br />
<br />
(SPOILERS) <br />
the show gives Pacifica amnesia, gets her another guardian, makes him sacrifice himself to protect her, and then gives her back her memories by having her remember Shannon&#039;s love for her. <br />
(ENDSPOILERS)  <br />
<br />
All of which does nothing to further either character or develop the themes. Emotional porn 101. As such, character development across the board is miniscule or trivial. Other than people doing what they think is right by not killing the obviously innocent girl instead of listening to religious brainwashing, you have the standard &quot;logical AI&#039;s develop emotion&quot; trash. <br />
<br />
Of course, the series also tackles major themes that might give the semblance of depth. I don&#039;t think so, and I&#039;ll explain possible thematic connections and why they don&#039;t work:<br />
<br />
SPOILERS AHEAD<br />
1) Discussion of fate/religious prophecy/destiny. First of all, it doesn&#039;t exactly discuss destiny because a prophecy that says something will happen is different from the thing factually happening. One of the central conflicts is whether or not to believe in the religious prophecy that says the scrapped princess will bring doom to the world, which makes sense in the medieval setting, where religion would play a large role in people&#039;s lives. However, the general problem of using this as a theme is that prophecies in stories almost never work. If the story says the prophecy is true, then there&#039;s nothing else to be said except maybe accept your fate. Usually though, if the prophecy is something negative, the story necessarily has to eventually reveal that the prophecy is false, in which case the only thing that can be said was that prophecies aren&#039;t always accurate so you can&#039;t base your actions entirely on them. Then the aesop is too simple and there&#039;s nothing to be learned. In the case of Scrapped Princess the prophecy is so at odds with common sense and morality that the obvious answer is that the prophecy is wrong, which was confirmed by the story about 11 episodes in. Pacifica is obviously a normal girl that has not shown the slightest tendency nor power of destroying the world and killing her would be cold blooded murder. It&#039;s like when people thought the world was going to end in 2012 and the only evidence was that the Mayan calendar ended on that day. The only lesson learned is that prophecies with little basis in reality are stupid, which the characters of Scrapped Princess learn upon meeting Pacifica. There&#039;s nothing about defying destiny here. <br />
<br />
That&#039;s not to say the idea of prophecies or fate can&#039;t be used in storytelling at all. Rather, a prophecy or idea of fate has to be tied in a natural chain of causality such that things SEEM inevitable and thus characters actually have to grapple with the idea that most things are beyond their control, which definitely occurs in real life. In the case of Scrapped Princess, this would involve a Pacifica who manifests destructive powers and has trouble controlling her temper. That way, the prophecy would only be accentuating the human problem of not being able to control oneself and thus be doomed for a path of self-destruction. The idea of prophecy and fate would be relevant insofar as they describe how hopeless it can feel for someone to overcome their personal weaknesses. This would be similar to something like Lenny from Of Mice and Men, wherein the character seemed doomed from the very start. Done this way, the prophecy being proven wrong wouldn&#039;t be proving that it was a religious sham, BOOM all problems solved, but rather people worked their asses off to change the course of events from their most likely outcome. It would also make people&#039;s choice to believe in Pacifica much more significant, because they chose to see the good in a person who was so flawed, rather than make the obvious decision to not kill a perfectly normal girl. <br />
<br />
2) Defying the gaslighting of religious belief--- if it was going for this, the series only touches upon this lightly, again owing to the fact that the characters decide to believe in Pacifica so easily. It doesn&#039;t explore the intense internal struggles that people who&#039;ve grown up with a religion face when they start questioning that religion, and all the thoughts that go with it. In fact the series portrays religion in a pretty one-sided manner by making it the instrument of oppression on the human race. It doesn&#039;t offer any more depth than any one of those fake church episodes from episodic action adventures. <br />
<br />
3) Humanity is too self destructive for its own good and should be controlled, freedom vs security--- the series is out of its depth when it touches on this subject. An alien race decides that humanity if left alone would destroy itself, so it fights a war with it. They fight a war to end all wars, basically. Then one of the humans decides the war will take too many more lives so she betrays the human race and gets it enclosed in a tightly controlled environment stuck in medieval times (apparently advanced technology is too dangerous). This is obviously too extreme of a solution that values security over a total lack of freedom. Furthermore the standard of living has generally increased since medieval times and international relations are much more heavily regulated now than it was then. But it still could have worked, if the series had explored the advantages of living in such a world weighed against the freedom or lack of freedom of the people living in it. Unfortunately, such worldbuilding is scarce. Instead, Pacifica gets the God of this enclosed world to free humanity after telling her that people should have the freedom to make their own choices and take responsibility for it, and God agrees just like that, as if she didn&#039;t have any basic historical knowledge about governance and this 16 year old girl who knows nothing provided this piece of wisdom to her. Basically, this series discusses the issue by swinging the pendulum between two extremes and thus produces no meaningful thematic exploration. Who would&#039;ve guessed that humans should have free will, right?<br />
<br />
ENDSPOILERS<br />
<br />
That wraps up the themes. In the end, I don&#039;t think there is a single element that this show did well. <br />

    Scrapped Princess presents an outstanding setting and plot. As the writer Arthur Clarke says in one of his laws: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;. This concept, alone, is enough for two genres as disparate as fantasy and science fiction to become compatible, but also, the transition from a medieval, magic-filled world into something more complex, with such an harmonious and right pacing, gives this anime its own style and a feeling that might be imposible to replicate in any later works. In other words, this series is simply unique in this way. The world is also vast, consistently built and explored in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376374">
        detail: the viewer will travel through several places whilst finding subtle tracks about the background story, which creates a great feeling of immersion.<br />
<br />
During this adventure, different groups of people with diverse beliefs (not only in a religious sense, but also in the livingstyle and even personal values) will be shown, as well as the inherent conflicts that come along with the opposition of different ways of thinking, and here comes the main thematic: What&#039;s best for mankind, for a human being? To be protected from dangers and live comfortable, but at the price of being privated from their free will? Or to be free to decide their own fate, but assuming the risks of chosing wrong, perhaps even facing one&#039;s own destruction? This debate is heavily present throughout mostly all episodes, and as well as several other secondary topics, will reach a conclusion.<br />
<br />
The main character, Pacifica Cassull, is an extremely passive, comformist and carefree person for most episodes, which might make her unpleasant at times, but she&#039;s designed like that in order to explore the aforementioned subjects. She will slowly learn about different perspectives and grow to give the story a closing. Truly tri-dimensional, she has many traits, both negative and possitive: she&#039;s also kind, worries about others and strugles with the suffering that her existence causes to others because of a fate that others decided for her. She&#039;s got behaviours that might seem contradictory but that&#039;s always coherent in the end. All this makes her realistic and the perfect protagonist for this anime. The rest of the main cast is also remarkably well designed since they all have properly defined personalities, their own motivations, have dinamic and organic interactions and keep the plot moving into the right way.<br />
<br />
Everything referred to the artwork is just impressive for the time this series was aired. Animation has a great use of colour for every situation and a truly high level of detail (both for characters and landscapes). The action scenes are really fluid, which, alongside variable camera angles, make them epic and memorable. As for the soundtrack, it is in my opinion, one of the best I have ever heard. Every track has a lot of emotion and fits perfectly every scene, making drama and action really intense, at the same time contributing to the series&#039; identity.<br />
<br />
The series has a couple of small defects, though. In several moments the subtle narrative will be replaced by perhaps too much oral exposition, which can turn the watching a little dense at times. Also, there&#039;s a character that, despite endearing, is somewhat bland for the role he performs. Yet, these trifles pale compared to the job this anime does, and for that reason, it is nearly a perfect show.<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess doesn&#039;t deserve less than a 10/10. A masterpiece as few out there.

    I first watched Scrapped Princess back when it was originally being fansubbed. I decided then that it was the best anime I had ever seen, and my opinion hasn&#039;t changed. To this day it&#039;s still my number one favorite and I&#039;ve watched it over at least three times. Recently I decided to watch it again, and I was inspired to write this review from the perspective of a long time fan.<br />
<br />
The story of Scrapped Princess is remarkably engaging. The setting, middle-age fantasy with elements of science fiction, is still believable. This is the kind of fantasy world I would like to live in. I find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21012">
        myself almost drawn in as I watch. Coupled with great character development, each episode is enjoyable and the plot never feels like it&#039;s dragging on for too long. I only wish the backstory would have been explained in more detail regarding the Dragoons and Peacemakers, as well as their creators.<br />
<br />
Speaking of characters, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a single genuinely unlikeable person in this whole story. Even the baddest of the bad ones I can hardly bring myself to hate, and I really feel like I want the good guys to win. Each character has his own distinct personality traits, but they aren&#039;t overplayed, and tragic moments actually feel tragic.<br />
<br />
Everything is drawn well in Scrapped Princess. The characters are never off-model and the backgrounds in most scenes are nothing short of beautiful. The fantasy-sci fi setting is presented incredibly well. Ruins of a highly advanced, long dead civilization dot the landscape, but scenes still evoke an &quot;old world&quot; feeling.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say much about the music. It seems pleasantly understated, if anything. Nothing stands out in the soundtrack, but it always fits the mood.<br />
<br />
Regardless of its faults, I can&#039;t possibly recommend Scrapped Princess more. I&#039;ve never seen anything else like it. It doesn&#039;t get old no matter how many times I watch. To me, the plot is still just as fascinating as it was when I first saw it.

    This is so much like Slayers and Rune Soilder but then, it’s not like anything that really has been done before. It is placed in a fantasy kingdom called Leiwan that’s pretty much under a religious order. <br />
<br />
Pacifica always acts like a princess even though she grew up with her brother and sister. For a 15 year old girl, she pretty much acts like any normal 15 year old girl. Bitchy, whiny and all together bothersome in most places. She does get annoying at some times but in the end, you really feel for her. She was thrown away at birth and has only her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review73249">
        foster siblings to live with. You can really tell that she loves both her siblings but it seems that she really loves Shannon. I guess you could consider her to have a big brother complex even if he isn’t her real brother. Although she is always called the poison that will destroy the world, she makes lasting impressions on those that meet her.<br />
<br />
Shannon himself seems to always have problems wondering what he should even do. He fights within himself on the duty he has for his family and for all the other people around him. Even though he fights within himself, when on the battlefield, he protects her without thought. I myself think he looks really cute by the way. He is really reserved and doesn’t really show his emotions towards his siblings. He hates anybody outside the family and doesn’t trust them even if they show that they can be. When we talk about Shannon, we also have to talk about Zefiris who shows up in episode 2. I won’t exactly say why, but she has a large connection to Shannon and helps them with information. She sounds just like a computer with how logical she talks and acts. <br />
<br />
Raquel is the oldest of the siblings, very kind and motherly to both Shannon and Pacifica. She normally keeps a level head and uses powerful magic, able to cast them rather fast. She doesn’t really have a lot of backstory and her personality to me feels a bit like it is lacking on some aspects, not really as filled out as Shannon and Pacifica. When putting her next to the other two, she doesn’t stand out as well as the others in the series including the people who are not related.<br />
<br />
Leo takes up the clueless knight area. He is a noble knight who falls in love with Pacifica and his love never seems to faulter no matter what. He is always proposing to her and trying to protect her when he sees her until finds out about her being a scrapped princess. After that, he fights with himself with the question ‘What is Chivalry?’ and the question haunts him.<br />
<br />
The Animation is wonderfully done with fluid movements as known from Studio Bones. I don’t really see many problems in the artwork as every little detail is done pretty well. There are things that I nit pick about it though like in the second episode, what the hell is the map the old women gave them? There is nothing to actually use to find the house they are looking for!<br />
<br />
The opening is really lovely, and sounds really nice like a fairy tail beat. I truly love the English dub of the show even if it seems a little off in some of the background characters. The main characters are pretty perfect for the show, giving it the air of class. Crispin Freeman does a perfect job as Shannon, like almost all the characters he does, and makes him sound reserved and calm. He does sometimes seem too reserved but I think that more fits him. There are a lot of words that are used without much definition to the point that we sort of need a Glossary to figure them out. I wish they had a little more information about the different things like the Dragoon and Phase Space. Many of them are rather technical for a fantasy based show and open up the posiblities of something else going on. <br />

    Scrapped Princess.... hmmm. This one is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and bought the DVD&#039;s. It even made it as part of my favorites, although not top 5. A few minor spoiler hints but nothing too specific are included.<br />
<br />
Wait... Why do I sound down about a top 10 favorite you ask? Well its simple really. I&#039;m big on something called setting the scene. How do i mean ? That is also very simple. But first Lets talk about what I liked about the show.<br />
<br />
The story is nothing too spectacular but it does have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29417">
        its moments, as the storytelling is overall pretty good in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Art is average to above average. Character designs are done overall very well as well as scenery feeling alive and not just a backdrop for everything else. Battle effects are done very well, and the spell effects are excellent. <br />
<br />
Characters are likable. Even the principle villains are interesting and with a few exceptions don&#039;t feel flat. Characters motivations are pretty generic, but it is easy to understand why characters act they way they do for the most part.<br />
<br />
Overall I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone seeking an adventure with mixed magic and swordplay along with fragments of highly advanced technology thrown into the mix. This is not a little kids show about courage and facing off against higher powers. People die, lives are shattered, characters are manipulated into trying to kill the scrapped princess. Even a (short lived) primary supporting character is shot full of arrows and dies in the streets leaving us in a  bit of a predicament at one point.<br />
<br />
I do feel I need to mention post processing of how each episode ends its a bit jarring. It can flow from whatever is happening on screen strait into the outro music. Sometimes this is abrupt and feels almost like the producers couldn&#039;t find a good place to cut the episode off. This not setting suspense for the next episode, this is just a jarring cut.<br />
<br />
The other thing I can really rip my hair out about this and what prevents it from being a top five favorite is this series implementation of some of its sound mechanics.  <br />
<br />
Voice acting is fine and even above average. Sound effects are concise and used without problem. The intro song is pretty good actually, while the outro is forgettable. In scene music is mostly forgettable, with a few exceptions taking the lead from time to time.  <br />
<br />
Well that&#039;s average or above average sound use right? well it is except for one thing that bothers me a great deal. Maybe I&#039;m just spouting crap. but the break to and return from commercial interlude completely breaks the scene for me.  I mentioned that I&#039;m big on setting the scene, that means that the mood of the scene is just right to convey some emotion whether that be intense anger and the lust to fight, or deep sorrow and despair. Oh wait . Commercial interlude *Happy / Cheerful accordion ( I think) tune plays twice* Back to despair. *Scene of me ripping my hair out* I really want to rate this series 10 for a moment based on its other merits and then plays the interlude. <br />
<br />
I will compromise and give the show a 8.5 rating overall. I still highly recommend this series, just not the interlude...I&#039;ve even gone so far as to consider ripping and editing the interlude out of each episode just so I can enjoy this series to its fullest.<br />
<br />

    I think I have been too harsh whenever I said that I’m not interested in any form of media that is close to an RPG or has Middle Earth elements but that statement still stand by me because there’s nothing remotely interesting about that genre, aside from most Final Fantasy games (I’m not sure about the other media with the Final Fantasy name) but I’m mostly willing to give one of them a shot especially with this particular title, which has recommended (sort of) from a fellow reviewer I know.<br />
<br />
Pacifica Casull is the most feared and hated person by the followers of the God Mauser.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88525">
        Known as the Scrapped Princess, she is the poison that will destroy the world. To avoid being killed by the zealots of Mauser, Pacifica and her adoptive brother and sister leave the village of Manhurin. Her brother, Shannon, is an expert with the sword while Racquel is proficient with magic. At every step of the way, however, someone is constantly trying to kill Pacifica, hoping to somehow avert the catastrophe that is supposed to befall the world on her 16th birthday.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will admit that I like the plotline for this title as it deals with a burden of being born with a curse and that you have to live with that of people constantly hating you for what you are because of your title yet once you know them, they are not that bad of a person that they make you out to be. Plus, the show is run of a quick and constant pace as it doesn’t feel too long whenever you watch it, as in watching the first 6 episodes is 2 hours long but you don’t think that it’s dragging or wasting your time.<br />
<br />
I got to say for the characters, there is one flaw within the characters of the show: NONE OF THEM ARE UNLIKABLE! As in, I find every character of the show to be enjoyable to watch once you get to know them in the story. In the beginning, the main character Pacifica Cassul may act like a brat in some of the episodes but you don’t really hate her since it wasn’t that obnoxious or overbearing. You really feel for the character that’s going through his status as the Scrapped Princess, being forsaken to that, and it helps that she can be a sweet person on the inside. Shannon Cassul is the straightforward older brother, meaning he doesn’t have time to fool around when it comes to protecting his sister and is a great swordfighter.  Raquel is the oldest of the siblings and she is very calm and motherly figure of the show, which is what I liked about her as in groups, people do need that type of person who assures themselves that things can work out. Other characters include Leo, the noble yet naïve knight who vows to protect Pacifica, and also has a crush on her, too, and Winia, the introverted and lonesome maid who later joined the Cassul siblings into their adventure.<br />
<br />
The animation from Studio BONES is very 2000s vintage considering as of now, it’s been almost 10 years since its creation in 2003 and it doesn’t look aged at all but the artwork, character designs and backgrounds are very fluid and strikingly impressive by today’s standards or even the standards of 6 years ago.<br />
<br />
Musically, I can say for the opening theme, it seems like a bit of Scottish and/or medieval charm was heavily influenced by that, as well as the background music. The ending music, I didn’t feel much of that influence on there but it is serviceable for the ending theme.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I got to say on the Bandai/Bang Zoom dub is that this is one of the most well-done dubs I have ever watched. It also helps that Crispin Freeman, not only voices Shannon, but he is also the ADR director and writer of the show and it shows that Freeman can be awesome behind the screen as well as being the voice. Kari Wahlgren as Pacifica is one of her better roles of likable characters, right next to Haruko from FLCL and Saya from Blood+ and Bridget Hoffman does a great and nuanced job as always playing the cool and calm role of Raquel and even supporting roles filled by Michelle Ruff, Yuri Lowenthal, and Kirk Thornton among others are decent in their roles.<br />
<br />
FINAL VERDICT: I can easily say that Scrapped Princess is one of those shows that you should definitely check out (if you can, since you-know-who has folded). It has a great amount of pacing, enjoyable characters with great development and something that can combine things you don’t even like in anime into saying you love.<br />

    When I first began watching the series, it was fairly satisfying to watch. But little did I know that it would quickly become one of my all time favorites. The pace at the beginning was relatively slow and peaceful, but gradually builds up to something rather amazing. Theres a fair bit of heart wrenches and universe twists in the second half of the series. The story was very good and well paced. However the ending seemed lacking in comparison and the pacing in the beginning may have been a tad too slow.<br />
<br />
The art, animation and sound were all very good and high quality for an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review149879">
        anime of its time. The environment and props fitted together well, most of the time. I found myself disagreeing with the anime&#039;s idea of fashion and advanced weaponry, but those are very much personal preferences.<br />
<br />
Many interesting and unique characters are introduced through the series, although one or two minor characters felt more cliche and shallow than the anime deserved. <br />
<br />
Overall it is a wonderful anime with a few, very minor downfalls. A worthy watch that definitely deserves more attention than it has.<br />

    Scrapped princess is a good story, I personally think. While I may of only watched 2 episodes, I have read the manga half way when I was younger. So I know the back story of the characters and other details they didn&#039;t place in the anime. But I even though I read it years ago, I still can&#039;t forget the feeling of reading a good story. And I still feel that even while watching it. While it does have different ways of showing the story of Pacifica, I still good ol&#039; Scrapped Princess. But I think it would&#039;ve been nice if they showed the background

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35406">
        story, instead of worrying about episode length. It would&#039;ve made it more enjoyable for the people that never read the manga before. Now on with the review!<br />
<br />
Story: The basic story is this, In this world, there was these twins born in the royal family. One of the twins (Pacifica) was foretold to be the &quot;poison that destroys the world&quot; if she was to reach her 16th birthday. To prevent this she was thrown off a cliff (Anyone have heard adoption?) and said to be dead, but really she was saved by the court wizard and taken to a foster family. No one had heard of her until she turned 15. Then she and her foster brother and sister, Shannon and Raquel, go to escape the country of Leinwan, protecting her on the way with magic, swords and fantasy things. :3<br />
<br />
Art: I think of it well, shows the action fights well and the magic was intresting how they show it being cast. It has the same feel as the Manga.<br />
<br />
Sound: I rather enjoyed the music. Good way to show the feeling of the story, a bit of sadness with hope in the mix.<br />
<br />
Character: The charcters had a good balance in it. I liked Raquel the most, her sweetness, but I can detect some kind of hostility in it when someone messed with her baby sister. Shannon was pretty awesome, super cool with his sword fighting and his whole attitude, In battle made his awesome, like, &quot;I don&#039;t have time for this crap, and when he&#039;s arguing with Pacifica, pretty funny, reminds me of my brother and I. and there is Pacifica, her attitude I felt was pretty good. She may act selfish, but really.. I felt was a disguise to hide her fear of the future and her only family. She really is a sweet girl, brave and honest. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I say, pretty nice thing to watch when bored. Has some funny moments, but some make me sad. I mean, who wants to be told, &quot;You shouldn&#039;t of never been born.&quot; But all in all, a really good anime, I&#039;m still gonna keep watching though!<br />
<br />
Overall: I say, read the Manga first, before the anime. It can save the confusing of the background story of the sibilings and the story itself. So when you&#039;re watching it, you would know what is going on and why. :3 <br />
<br />
But I say, watch it if you want something different in princess/ medivial stories.<br />

    you know when some people hear the word princess they think its all girly or they think that it will be full of happy ever after.<br />
well this is something much different . this anime has vivid drawing and every move is very clear, you will not be confused at any cost .<br />
 this story is about a princess of course but she is not like all the other princess. the princess was suppose to be killed after she was born but she was not she grew up happily not knowing her fate. it is said that when she turns 16 she will destroy this world.<br />
when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17519">
        the king found out that was not dead he sent people to kill her. after her foster parents has been killed she found out whats going on. so her step brother and step sister and she is taking a journey to some place where they will be safe. in there journey they come across many problems and powers that will help them or kill them. <br />
there is some twist and turns along the way you might like it. i give scrapped princess all the credit she deserves.<br />
the anime is funny and sad it has drama it has fighting and it has more .<br />
let me know if u have any question.<br />
