    “Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle.”<br />
<br />
BNA: Brand New Animal is ambitious. It attempts to craft a fully-realized setting to explore nuanced political themes such as racism, fascism, eugenics, and activism. Simultaneously, it tells the story of estranged friends, super-powered crime fighters, a government conspiracy, and cults. In twelve episodes.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Trigger bit off more they could chew. <br />
<br />
BNA begins with a hooded girl in tattered clothing running through the subway. She passes by a sign reading, “Let’s Hold Hands. Animal Rights,” above the text is a human hand holding an animal paw. This immediately establishes a theme: Humans and anthropomorphized animals live

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338882">
        together, but not in harmony. A group of shady men walk down the hallway—the girl hides in fear because she is part animal. The men spray paint “Beastmen should die,” now we know there’s discrimination. Immediately after, the girl runs past a TV, the news is on—a reporter announces a special zone for Beastmen has existed for ten years. Soon after, we find out the beastmen zone is an entire city, known as Animacity, exclusive to beastmen. It is an ethnostate funded by a private pharmaceutical corporation. <br />
<br />
We have been given a lot of information very quickly. In this world, humans despise beastmen to the point they were forced to build an ethnostate. The widespread racism is an allusion to our world, albeit in a much shallower way. In the real world, racism leads to over-policing, biases in the court system, lower wages, and more. There’s so little indication about how racism affects beastmen, other than violence. So why do humans hate beastmen? Well, because they want to preserve Japanese values? Later on, a slew of information is poured onto us; Beastmen can transform into humans at will. The media does not indicate they pose any threat to humans. It seems like the only perceivable problem is their appearance, they look different from humans sometimes. Perhaps it will be explained later, let’s continue… While trying to reach the city, the girl is attacked by a group of racist fanatics who intend to kill her. The fanatics express their disgust for how the girl looks. Okay. Humans love animals and they’re fine with other humans, so why do they hate people who look like animals? <br />
<br />
Confusion aside, the girl is conveniently saved by a wandering beastman, a mischievous Mink who calls herself Mari. The greedy Mink demands money for saving the girl’s life, we now know her name is Michiru. I need to get Mari out of the way right now. She is a recurring figure, I hesitate to call her a character because… she isn’t one. Mari shows up at random times when it is convenient for the plot. At first, I was willing to overlook the contrivances because I expected the show to develop her, but she remained one-note. If the pacing slows down, she causes conflict or gives the plot a device to get moving. This would be kind of ok if she was a good character, but she’s one-note. She is a crook who tricks people out of their money, and she always has to remind us she is a mink. “I’m a mink, not a weasel!” Yes, that is what you are. I wish you weren’t just a Mink, but a character too. The supporting cast is full of hollow cartoonish archetypes like Mari. In comparison, Michiru is a much better character.<br />
<br />
Witnessing Animacity through Michiru’s eyes is what makes her immediately relatable. She was originally an average human with dreams and aspirations. Through mysterious circumstances, she has turned into a beastman. As an outsider, she knows nothing about beastmen culture. We learn about the world at the pace she does. Although she’s easily tricked and manipulated, her compassion for others makes her likable. Michiru is a mystery. How did she turn into a beastman? How does she have these powers? How does the government know of her? Do not worry, dear reader, all of these questions are answered. To avoid spoilers, I will say just this: you will be disappointed with how lazily written the answers are. Michiru’s motives are very simple; Why did she turn into a beastman and how will she go back to normal? Her struggle between hating the beastmen world and not being accepted in the human world is incredibly sympathetic. She was robbed of her human life, her hatred is justifiable. In the show’s subtly beautiful scene, Michiru hesitates to reach out to her human mother on her birthday. Yet she can’t do it until she’s human again. I’m sorry to say this is one of the many intriguing plot threads left unresolved. Michiru’s family and background are ignored for the rest of the show. This completely contradicts her entire motivation, to go back home. It felt like a slap in the face to see a character I liked so much be wasted on soulless writing. <br />
<br />
Michiru is no ordinary beastman. In desperate situations, she can gain a superpower-like ability. Cheetah legs to run faster, Rabbit ears for listening, long arms to save herself, etcetera. During fight scenes, BNA shines. Michiru’s creative super-powers fluidly animated and the amazing synth soundtrack underscores every action sequence. Everything that’s animated has an impactful sound. High production values aren’t enough to overlook the odd inconsistencies with Michiru’s powers; In one situation, Michiru falls from a 100-meter building, but she is unable to grow wings to fly. Later on, in a similar situation, she can fly. In the first situation, she can’t fly because the writers need an excuse for her to be saved by someone. In the second, the writers decide there are bird beastmen too, so now she has wings. When a story has internal logic as inconsistent as this it’s obvious the episodes were likely written one at a time without forethought. All of Michiru’s problems stem from her inability to swap into her human form, unlike normal beastmen. There’s one instance in an early episode in which she becomes a human out of nowhere. This asspull is never explained, it happens solely as an excuse for a side-plot. It’d be fair to say her powers don’t have any logical consistency. <br />
<br />
The deuteragonist, Shirou, is a beastman with a deep hatred for humans. He’s a superhero who needs no praise, only justice. Like Michiru, he has special powers. Along with strength and speed, his scent is so good it can be used as evidence by law. <br />
When he closes his eyes, the art style changes to silhouettes, discordant music plays, and he solves a mystery. I have no clue how the police can trust someone enough to not lie about something as arbitrary as scent. There is no way to corroborate Shirou’s claims without a criminal confession from whoever he accuses. Shirou’s work as a part-time detective often overlaps with Michiru’s adventure to find answers. Their friendship isn’t a friendship. They coincidentally run into each other, then they start living together in a co-op home. They work together to fight crime, occasionally, but they have no chemistry. Shirou is such a dry character. When he’s not talking about his incredibly deep morals or info-dumping, he provides some great humor like this: <br />
<br />
“You have a cute assistant.” -Guy referring to Michiru, who is cute.<br />
“She’s not cute.” -Shirou<br />
<br />
Oh, ok buddy, sorry I said anything. Shirou’s so damn serious he deadens the laughter of any scene he’s in. In the eyes of the writers, this is not a problem. There’s nothing wrong with him, therefore he has no room to grow. He’s the perfect superhero, except his motivations make no sense. Imagine terrorists plant a bomb in an unknown location and you can locate it, what would you do? <br />
<br />
A. Tell the police where the bomb is.<br />
B. Try to defuse the bomb.<br />
C. Evacuate the area.<br />
D. Let the bomb explode.<br />
<br />
If you guessed D, check your refrigerator temperature, it is higher than your IQ. Don’t worry, you’re not alone, Shirou is as dumb as you. He plans to “Catch the criminals in the act,” as if finding a live bomb isn’t evidence enough. Another time, Michiru is trapped in a cage by criminals, while Shirou watches nearby. Rather than using his powers to help, he stands by and waits for the police, only to step in at the end to act like he saved the day. He constantly contradicts himself, then hides behind his unambiguous mantra, “Human bad, beastmen good.” When Michiru defies his orders, his default response is humans are evil and you&#039;re a human so you wouldn&#039;t understand. <br />
<br />
BNA had the potential to be good in the first six episodes. The pacing is fast, but it suited the show at first. Michiru’s adventure just flows in unexpected directions, it was exciting. The first five episodes tell individual stories, then the sixth introduces the actual story. At the start of the episode, there are always a few plot contrivances to get things going. This is a likely side effect of trying to write creative self-contained stories in a short time-frame. In the end, the first five episodes ended up feeling like filler. A variety of intriguing characters were introduced; Michiru made friends, learned life lessons, and expanded her worldview. Then it’d end, and we would never see newly introduced characters ever again. It’s a shame because I think these episodes touch on intriguing themes such as censorship, virtue-signaling, and class inequality. <br />
<br />
One of these ‘filler’ episodes focuses on an amateur baseball team in the slums of Animacity. Michiru joins the team due to a series of coincidences, per BNA standard, and uses her powers to win games. The kids are an adorable band of misfits bears. They were born poor and they’ll die poor, or so they say. And that’s the cycle of poverty, isn’t it? Their coach is an alcoholic driven to crime because poverty has broken his spirit. He lost what made him love baseball, driven money rather than pride. This episode is cute and all, but something didn’t sit right with me. I expected the series to address the huge divide between the upper class and the lowest in Animacity. In reality, over 20 million people in Japan are impoverished, so tell us why. Make us sympathize with these people because BNA’s audience sure as hell isn’t homeless. For all the time this show spends talking politics, the slums aren’t addressed as a serious issue. In BNA the lower class is caricatured as a bunch of dumb and greedy crooks, not as real people. People often end up in poverty if they struggle with mental illness, addiction, a lack of affordable housing. The poor characters are unintelligent—that’s the entire joke. It’s the anime equivalent of laughing at a homeless person. In every developed country on Earth, poor people lack access to public services, like schools. If they have nothing to drink except filthy water, like the bear kids have to, this will also contribute to their lower IQ. BNA’s interpretation of poverty is just a classist mocking of poor people. <br />
<br />
Trigger has addressed similar political topics in Kill la Kill, which was also set in a fascist state. But Kill la Kill was about revolting against the system, not accepting it. BNA is about embracing the system. Michiru becomes friends with the friendly dictator. This is a little strange because the dictator isn’t a good person. Animacity is an authoritarian ethnostate. Information from the outside world is censored like it is in North Korea; Note, the dictator is exempt from this rule. Normal beastmen are forbidden from learning about human society via the internet, restricted by law. Beastmen are made to believe humans are genetically inferior to them; Unifying people with us vs them rhetoric keeps them in line. The city is not run by democracy. People are subservient to a ubiquitous figurehead manufactured by the state. Festivals are run by the government to celebrate Animacity’s liberation from humans. All of this reflects an integral part of fascism, the aestheticization of politics—embedding politics into the minds of the population. Whether the writers intended it to appear this way or not, this is the most interesting aspect of BNA. <br />
<br />
In reality, Japan is practically an ethnostate. The people are 97% Japanese, and the population is rapidly shrinking. The economy is in the shitter because of it. Japan could solve its money problems if they let more immigrants into the country. I had hoped BNA would make a political statement on how being an ethnostate isn’t economically viable, but instead, it just supported ethnostate. We’ve been here before, Trigger. You have to realize your country is fucked sooner or later. If you’re going to write a political story, is this the message you want to send? Immigration almost always has a net positive effect on federal, state, and local budgets. All available evidence implies immigration leads to a better-educated workforce, more innovation, greater occupational specialization, and higher economic productivity.<br />
<br />
Despite BNA’s shallow themes, I love the minor details in Animacity. Like restaurant signs with slightly different names from real life (Dog-way, lol!). Aside from the thinnest layer of world-building, there’s not a whole lot of visible differences between the human world and the beastman world. This leads me to wonder, why? Why beastmen? Why animals? There’s no social hierarchy of species, no conflict between carnivores and omnivores, and no world-build to flesh out the distinct differences between beastmen and humans aside from appearance. Beastmen are interchangeable with anything inhuman, demons, vampires, fish people, dwarves. This is, however, not about the rise of the dwarven ethnostate, it is about animals because this is a furry anime. The use of anthropomorphized animals in BNA is completely arbitrary. If you want a good show that explores the implications of a society run by animals, watch Beastars, not this cheap bait. Furries might love this anime, this is their anime, more power to them. <br />
<br />
I’m incredibly disappointed at how phoned in BNA is. Trigger is capable of so much more than this. Instead of crafting an ambitious original anime, they played it safe and made a cash grab. There are few anime with so much budget and talent that waste it all on lazy writing. By the end, it crashes and burns in a clusterfuck of disorganized ideas and unintelligible motives so awful it will leave people howling with frustration for how good Brand New Animal could have been.

    Having seen 6 episodes of this show thus far, I can certanly say that it seems promising! <br />
<br />
BNA is very much your usual Trigger show. The plot is all around not that hard to predict, but it&#039;s truely well done and presented in such a way that it&#039;s enjoyable to follow along with. <br />
<br />
Without going into to much details regarding the shows major plot points, it&#039;s something like a crossover between beastars and kill la kill. The wacky Trigger animation and storytelling methods in combination with a cast that can shapeshift into half human - half animal hybrids makes for some very interesting worldbuilding. <br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332511">
        Main character is Michiru Kagemori, a human that suddenly was turned into a beastman. In this world you are either born as a human or a beastman, so a human suddenly becoming a beastman is unheard of. It would be something like a human in our world suddenly turning into a dog or a cat. <br />
<br />
Michiru is a very positive and cheeky girl, who can be a bit of a tomboy. She finds herself seperated from her normal human life, and must come to terms with the realities that face the beastmen of this world. She makes her way to Animacity, the only city in the world where beastmen can live freely and away from oppression from humans. <br />
<br />
In Animacity she gets to interact with several interesting characters. Most notably she mees the half human - half wolf man Shirou Ogami, who is a detective/associate for the police department of Animacity. Together they work together to solve some of the crimes that Animacity faces, and at the same time try to figure out Michirus beastman condition. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a bit to early to give the show any kind of final score, but so far I am having a blast with it! If you like any of Triggers other works, you are sure to enoy this one as well.<br />
<br />
Ps: The opening is a total banger.

    Alright alright. When I first took a glance at BNA, I felt that it was going to be something pretty cool and awesome. Well, was I wrong, or was I right? I’d say neither. BNA is a show that shows the darker side of the world if beastmen really existed. <br />
<br />
Firstly, I was pretty shocked to find out that BNA was 12 episodes instead of 24. The setting and everything made it feel like it would have lasted a lot longer than what it actually is. The world-building and everything made you have an easy understanding of what is going on with their world and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338877">
        I honestly appreciate that they used several episodes for that. The story is extremely simple and straightforward, with some things still left unexplained, such as how does Michiru has all these incredibly supernatural powers, even in a supernatural world. I personally enjoyed this show a lot, how you could have never dreamed of such a city being existent in our world. And that the balance between the comedy and the seriousness was of good standards. That dark feeling along with Slice of Life being the jam on top of it created that urban fantasy type of feeling. <br />
<br />
Even though the story was shown in a straight-forward and simple way as it chooses not to be sophisticated, however, those final few episodes in my honest opinion wasn’t able to push out a darker feeling than I expected it to release. Like I said, Slice of Life is the jam, don’t forget what you’re eating is still the bread. I feel that a darker final few episodes, even if the resolution is still the same, would have impacted many more audiences, myself included. <br />
<br />
Another thing that got me started on BNA was the pretty unique art style. Nowadays most modern anime (especially isekais) tend to adapt with that pretty generic art style which I don’t mean to be an elitist or anything, I don’t appreciate much. So having this unique curvy, joyful, and dynamic art style is definitely a plus in the art department. As for animation, I don’t have much to say, it’s Trigger. They&#039;ve always been gorgeous when it comes to their style of animation. If they fail in animation, it’s the same as saying KyoAni produces shitty art—which in contrast, produces the most eye-candy art you&#039;ll ever imagine.<br />
<br />
As for sound goes, I was pretty satisfied. Actually, I was more than satisfied, I was pretty impressed. The OSTs, OP &amp; ED, all had that urban modern society taste imbued into them, along with a bit of a futuristic kind of feeling as well. This led me to really enjoy them and rock to the beat, although that is more of a subjective thing. One OST that impacted me was that song Michiru and Nazuna sang together, it reminded me of how special friends were, and yeah. That’s literally all.<br />
<br />
The character development for the characters I would say wasn’t the most substantial, but it’s decent for a 12 episode series. Especially Oogami, his character development, backstory, and everything was really well-done and Trigger deserves a thumbs up for that. Michiru like what Nazuna always tells her hasn’t changed much. Well, I suppose that is pretty realistic, humans don’t change much over such a short period of time do they, especially for somebody as stubborn as Michiru. But the characters overall were really enjoyable and I had a really fun time watching them. (Especially my little precious bear Jackie)<br />
<br />
Overall, I had loads of fun watching BNA, although story-wise it was not even close to what I had wanted, but I got something else that I didn’t ask for: Fun character interaction. Honestly, I’m satisfied with just that. So, you interested in BNA? Sure, go ahead, but don’t expect some crazy complicated storyline that even the great Hououin Kyouma can’t figure out. ;)<br />

    Story: 7<br />
As mentioned in some other reviews, the story becomes quite a cliché as it moves on.  There are so many questions that are left unanswered.  BNA is a story that draws parallels between real-world discrimination and discrimination against the beastmen and also how money often drives horrible things that can happen in society.  In trying to deliver this message through the story, Trigger did a great job, despite having a plot that is so obvious that it can be seen from a mile away.  <br />
<br />
The story could have been much better fleshed out and become much more comfortable and less

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338878">
        rushed if the anime were longer than 12 episodes.  I genuinely don&#039;t understand why they didn&#039;t bother making at least 24 episodes; I really would have liked some more slice-of-life sessions (such as the baseball arc) to break apart the fast-paced storyline, which would also have allowed the side characters to play a larger role in the story (Mink ex machina?).  Sometimes I got tired watching the same people do the same things over and over again.<br />
<br />
The ideas in the story were quite inconsistent, and there were a lot of unexplained power-ups and ex machinas that could have been elaborated on.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Trigger has a very specific art style which is different from what we usually expect and pairs well with the lo-fi musical feel.  It takes a moment to get used to, although I did tend to enjoy it more as time went on.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Including the great OP, the music has a great feel for the story and I enjoyed the lo-fi vibes even though this kind of music is not what I usually enjoy listening to.  The voice actors were attuned to their characters.<br />
<br />
Character: 6<br />
Although I really enjoyed the characters (especially Michiru, of course) all of them ended up as stereotypes or very close to it.  There&#039;s nothing that&#039;s new or refreshing brought to the table in BNA, a story in which they could have done so much more with.  <br />
<br />
Overall enjoyment: 9<br />
I really did enjoy BNA.  While the plot was obvious, I enjoyed watching the characters navigate the city and explore the world that was laid out.  The story is obvious, but that&#039;s often because it often it&#039;s the best way to proceed.  I particularly enjoyed Trigger&#039;s unusual animation style and the music was pretty good!  While there are some issues with the anime, they are not inherently visible and are quite easy to miss if one isn&#039;t looking for them.<br />
<br />
Despite my negative comments, I did enjoy BNA a lot.<br />

    OK, so admittedly I am a huge Triger fan boy. Keep that in mind as i talk about this show. First off, my hype for this show was immense. Coming off the last Trigger show I saw, Gridman, I was ready for that sweet sweet predictable Trigger goodness. From here on out I&#039;ll break down the show in its components. Spoilers from here on thru episode 6.<br />
<br />
Story: The story so far, 6 episodes, feels not super linear. As in its not moving towards its main goal in a direct manner. Every episode, besides the first, feels as if it could be shuffled around and not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332616">
        effect the overall story too much. At this point I have to assume this show will be around 24 episodes with the slow pace we have now, mind you the show is insanely enjoyable at its current pace. Almost every joke lands super well, and I smile for most of each episode. Overall I would give the story so far a 7<br />
<br />
Art: the art is almost identical to the Trigger art style in Little Witch Academia. So its as simple as if you like that art style you will like this one. A couple asides from that though are; the backgrounds feel more &#039;there&#039; then in LWA, as in they feel like they aren&#039;t just a 2d wall behind the characters it has depth and a significant amount of detail to it. Another difrance from LWA is the color is more vibrant, almost every scene will have colors that pop out, if that&#039;s your taste then even better. Overall I would give the art a 8<br />
<br />
Sound: OK, so the OST for this show is inedible. The OST was actually one of the things I was most hype for going into this show. If you look who is credited with the music in the show it is mabanua. Now you probably do not know who mabanua is, well, he did the music for &#039;Kids on the Slope&#039; a music anime that takes place in 50&#039;s ish Japan and is my favorite Josei show out there, also my favorite music show in general. The only other anime he is credited for, OST wise, is &#039;Megalo Box&#039; the gritty futuristic world of boxing with probably one of the top 3 OSTs from 2018. Back to BNA though, every single episode has had one moment where the music kicks in and I cant help but think &quot;holy shit thats a good track.&quot; OST gets a 10 from me.<br />
<br />
Character: Lastly we have the character rating. As for the designs of the characters I think they each have a uniqueness that is overbearing, something Trigger has pretty much made a name for, and Each character design fits its characters personality spot on. The character personalities themselves are were the debate starts. I&#039;ve seen people talk about how they don&#039;t like Michiru&#039;s personality, how she is completely oblivious to everything, and that&#039;s OK. Anime characters are allowed to be dumber or more exaggerated than you or me. Now if you are the type of person who hates this character arc-type then you&#039;ll probably get very annoyed by Michiru. I personally find her the be charming and endearing. Its 100% personal preference if you like her or not. The other polarizing character is Shirou, the over-powered secondary lead. I suspect later in the show we will probably get a full episode or its equivalent in time allotment for his back story. He is pretty OP and its would be ridiculous if he wasn&#039;t explained thoroughly, since he represents the wolf god. To be fair, I think it doesn&#039;t really make sense to rate the character personalities themselves until they each finish their respective character arcs. So for now I am rating Character as an 8. Mainly for the designs.<br />
<br />
BNA is the new hotness by Trigger and if you&#039;ve enjoyed any of their previous works this is right up your ally

I usually don’t like to hype up anime in previews since you never know how the rest of the show will go, but damn, I’ve been enjoying the hell out of BNA so far! I’m usually hesitant about anthropomorphic themes, but man, it really adds layers and originality to this anime. <br />
<br />
We’re still in the beginning stages of the anime, so the overarching plot hasn’t been fully fleshed out yet. It essentially revolves around energetic, sporty protagonist Michiru Kagemori’s quest to find out how and why she was transformed from a human into a tanuki beastman. There’s a lot of mystery and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332658">
        intrigue surrounding the show, and I’m excited to see where Trigger goes with it. So I was originally gonna discuss my thoughts on the current state of the narrative and world building in a lot more detail, but screw it, I’ll save the in-depth technical analysis for the critics when BNA finishes airing. Instead I’d like to talk about how frickin fun the show has been thus far! I mean we do get the basic “humanity discriminates against the beastmen” spiel, but so far the show has actually been mostly depicting the inner fighting between the shapeshifting people of Animacity. Thank goodness, because I’ve been getting tired of the generic “All humans bad, all monsters good!” plot point in shows like this. I’d rather watch a bunch of overly buff animal gagsters with guns get beat up by a wolf dude and a tanuki chick anyway! <br />
<br />
While the main plot is still developing, there’s a lot of sub stories that have taken place within the first six episodes. They explore the world of BNA and showcase the extremity of the anima society. There’s child slavery, mobsters everywhere, and death baseball. It’s crazy over the top and I just love it. Plus the anime has some great comedy too. I mean it has frickin Winnie THE Pooh getting his face smashed in by a baseball among other things. It’s hilarious. In fact, the entire baseball episode was a comedy goldmine. It’s reminiscent of older Trigger shows with it’s complete randomness, but it was great, and I loved how it portrayed the charisma and never give up attitude of Michiru. <br />
<br />
Michiru herself has been a really enjoyable character to watch. She’s funny, capable, and full of life. Ogami is the other protagonist, and he’s a silent vigilante type who’s all about delivering that sweet, SWEET justice with his fists. The rest of the cast all have their quirks and keep things fun. Many of these characters have over the top mannerisms and ways of speech, which just enhances the entertainment value that they provide. Though the character who I’m especially interested in Michiru’s childhood friend Nazuna, who, despite her short screen time thus far, has been set up to be a sort of intelligent but misguided figure who may end up at odds with Michiru. She seems like she&#039;ll play a pivotal role in the narrative, and I hope that her character is handled well. <br />
<br />
The audiovisuals are hella lit. I thought that Winter 2020 had a weak line up of opening theme songs overall, and BNA’s opening &quot;Ready to” blows them all out of the water and then proceeds to throw them all back in the water and drown them. I’ve been listening to it on repeat while writing this preview because it’s frickin awesome! I also love how it’s performed by Michiru’s seiyuu, Morohoshi Sumire. Yes, voice actors sing the theme songs occasionally, but they’re usually no where close to being this good in quality, so a shout out to Sumire! The ending theme song is a great way to rap up each episode, and AAAMYYY (wow, even her name is over the top and hype!) does a great job with it. The song feels so relaxing and surreal, and it really pulls you into the atmosphere of the anime. And I just love the visual aesthetic of the ending theme. It’s stylistically amazing and I can’t stop watching it. Speaking of visuals, this anime thankfully utilizes the iconic cartoonish and over the top Trigger art. A lot of the studio’s recent works unfortunately adopted a different animation style, so I’m glad the studio went back to its roots for this. <br />
<br />
It’s thanks to shows like this that I’ve been sticking with anime for so damn long. BNA just oozes with creativity and insanity, and it was shows like this that got me into the anime medium in the first place. BNA has the added bonus of being full of intrigue and has the potential to develop a truly memorable story and cast. Let’s just hope Trigger doesn’t once again go down the dark path of pulling an alien plot twist out of their asses at the last minute to try and explain everything while throwing the established narrative and world building out the window. Fingers crossed! But for now I’m having a lot of fun with BNA, which so far has Been Notably Awesome!

Ever since the absurdest, laugh-inducing comedy of ‘Inferno Cop,’ Studio Trigger has gained the reputation of being the proverbial ‘devil’s advocate’ of animation studios.  That is to say: Studio Trigger infringes upon the unwritten, ‘anime construct’ that governs the rest of the industry.  Though, at the same time, utilizes the construct to subvert one’s expectations before it launches its satirical, action-packed juxtaposition.  And this was certainly the case for ‘Inferno Cop’ and ‘Kill la Kill.’ 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332646">
        However, for reasons unknown (due to my indolence in researching the topic), Studio Trigger abandoned this approach in ‘Darling in the FranXX’ and ‘SSSS.Gridman.’  Both of which underperformed due to the absence of wacky comedy, leaving a husk of tropes, banality, and disappointment in its wake.<br />
<br />
But it appears Studio Trigger has found their form once again via BNA (Brand New Animal).  An anime that features a spunky raccoon-dog, Michiru, as she seeks refuge in Anima city due to prejudice against beastkin (humanoid animals).  Abruptly, she comes into contact with a Batman-esque detective, Shirou, as they unravel the mystery behind peculiar happenings in Anima city.  Of course, you best forget everything I’ve said so far!—Because BNA’s plot and characters are superfluous in realization that it aimed at being a Looney Tunes-esque meta-comedy that transcends barriers of intellect to produce spurts of nostril-jizzing laughter.  T-that sentence makes sense…and YOU KNOW IT!!!<br />
<br />
The unadorned 2D aesthetic offers the animators flexibility in metamorphosizing the characters and their body parts in a fashion that does not appear janky or offensive to the eye.  Plus, it permits copious amounts of asininity to keep the viewer off-balanced and unsure of what’s coming next.  Which is the primary ask of any comedy-starved anime watcher.  In regards to the action, do not expect a resemblance to Hunter x Hunter or Yu Yu Hakusho.  But where BNA lacks in battle tactics and strategies, it makes up for in various animal transformations that make each battle incomparable to the last.  And with the story integrating offbeat aspects — like an MMA styled baseball game — you are constantly bewildered as to what is going to happen next.<br />
<br />
***As an aside.  Which baseball game was better?—Dorohedoro or BNA’s?***<br />
<br />
BNA’s Op, ‘Ready to,’ fits the series quite nicely, and is a fun jam that you will rarely skip before the start of each episode.  Overall, BNA an amusing, quirky series in what looks to be a relatively weak spring anime season.  And given the fact Studio Trigger’s record was a bit tarnished from its recent bungles, it is nice to see a thrust back to the thematic elements that made it one of the premiere studios in the anime medium.<br />
<br />
Another good furry anime…my, oh my, how the times have changed.

    You ever watch a series that feels like it tries to juggle too many plot points at once? When attempting to have a full story in the short time span of 12 episodes, you generally want to focus on only a few elements at a time, but this series tried to have its cake and eat it too, with concepts such as discrimination, segregation, poverty, super powers, corruption, a friends middling relationship, and it all ends with a subpar Trigger final battle that resolves all the issues in the city that it really shouldn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is Michiru, a young teenage girl who mysteriously turned into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340558">
        a beastman, a half human animal hybrid, and decides to run away to this city called Anima city where beastmen live separated from humans to avoid getting harassed by humans. As for why humans despise and discriminate against beastmen, that is never really given a proper explanation. Furthermore, beastmen have the capability to transform into normal humans and the question becomes why does anybody care about these beastmen to begin with. In any case, we follow Michiru and try to figure out why she was turned into a beastman and how she can transform back to normal so she can go back to her normal life with her parents. The first half of the series focuses on Michiru learning about Anima City and the conflicts surrounding the beastmen on a daily basis. Together with loner wolf man Shirou, they occasionally fight crime together.<br />
<br />
The first 5 episodes had a more episodic feel to them, such as Michiru joining a poor baseball team and inspiring them to not give up just to earn money, or this one episode where Michiru was trying to teach a group of children how to read and write for this mafia lady to get her wallet back. These episodes aren’t necessarily bad, but given how the show ends up, they do feel pointless in the grand scheme of things(Aside from ep 1). The baseball episode felt particularly egregious since aside from one adorable bear from the team, we really don’t see the team much ever again, and what could have been an interesting commentary on how a capitalistic system can force poor folk to stay poor, it just kind of ends on not giving up, which is nice, but it doesn’t really do much to explore this city.<br />
<br />
The other thing is that the show never focuses on how Anima City really operates. The city is generally unable to access the internet and the only way to do so would be through illegal means. How does this society function without the internet? What means do they have to get through their day to day lives? What do they do to get things done around the city? We do get parody brand names like Dog Way, and there seems to be a mafia gang running things behind the scenes, but generally speaking, we really don’t get much of anything out of this city. It has an Us vs Them mentality regarding humans and beastmen, but it&#039;s not like that&#039;s explored much beyond violence. There is a conflict involving the cult and what happens in the last two episodes is so stupid that I don&#039;t understand how this society even got off the ground. It&#039;s that bad.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing regarding Michiru at first would be her desire to return to being a human and go back to her town. There&#039;s this interesting scene where her parents wish her happy birthday over on Instagram and she hesitates to respond. Sadly, this conflict is never brought up again, and she decides to stay as a beastman anyways so her whole story felt useless. She even gains the ability to transform into a human out of nowhere in one of the earlier episodes and its never used again. She constantly gains all these abilities such as Cheetah legs to run fast, bird wings, stretchy arms, and so on, but it&#039;s never explained how she&#039;s able to do all these things. Then her friend Nezuna and her cult is introduced in ep 6 and this is where the show really starts to take a nosedive. To her credit, Nezuna does call out Michiru for continuously jumping to conclusions and acting before thinking, but this argument that they end up having doesn&#039;t really help her change for the better. If anything she continues to act the same while being a little sad as well. In the end, Michiru feels so detached from the main conflict of the series, and her end goal of becoming a human again is thrown to the wayside. Her character arc is the usual &quot;I&#039;ve come to accept myself as a beast&quot; trite that I&#039;ve only seen Shrek pull off. It would honestly make more sense if Shirou was the protagonist, though its not like he&#039;s a good character either. At least she&#039;s got a cute character design. I wish I would&#039;ve liked the cute tanuki girl more.<br />
<br />
Shirou is like that loner anime man that came out of the early 2000&#039;s. He&#039;s rude, hates humans, clearly has a dark past or some nonsense, and works alone. As a wolfman, he has the ability to sniff out certain people and objects such as bombs and so forth. He&#039;s a part time detective who works for the police. I don&#039;t get how something as arbitrary as smell is accepted as evidence to the police. Phoenix Wright would be all over their asses, but it&#039;s generally used for plot conveniences. What I don&#039;t like about Shirou is how he doesn&#039;t have any sort of character chemistry with Michiru and his character can be very easily summed up as &quot;Humans bad, Beastmen good&quot;. The bastard also allows a fucking bomb to explode to catch the criminals in the act when finding and stopping the bomb would be more than enough. When his &quot;backstory&quot; is revealed and they bring up WW2 I was laughing. Everything about him is such a hot mess.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say about the rest of the cast. Nezuna is mostly just a prop and a means to an end for the main villain as well as a source of conflict for Michiru, the main villain will not be named due to spoilers, but it&#039;s pretty obvious, and everybody else is fodder. <br />
 <br />
Now on to the general look of the series. The director of the anime is Yoh Yoshinari, and you may recognize that name from LWA since he was the director of that series. It really shows since this series looks rather similar to his previous work, though not quite as visually appealing in my eyes. Like that series, this show has a lot of character put into it with expressive facial expressions, pull and stretch animation, and a lot of energy when it counts. The final battle, as contrived as that was, did have a lot of visual flare to it, which I always appreciate. Having said all this, I was hoping that this show was going for a cyberpunk esque world given the previous poster that this series had when it was announced, and I quite like that aesthetic. I do wish Yoshinari and Trigger experimented a little more regarding this show, but it still looks appealing overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, there&#039;s the soundtrack. I do really like opening and ending songs, but the ending song is used way too much throughout the show. I get that anime likes to use their opening and ending songs sometimes as a nod, but in this case it feels super forced and annoying. By themselves however, they&#039;re nice to listen to. With the ending song has this sort of chilled vibe with a super stylish art style that I love. The rest of the soundtrack is fairly solid, with Mabuna who also did the OST for Megalo Box and he did a good job here. Easily my favorite part of the show.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I can&#039;t really recommend this series unless you lower your expectations to rock bottom. It lacks any kind of focus and generally feels directionless until the disaster that is the second half. It&#039;s not really worth your time. Just watch Beastars if you haven&#039;t already.

    I am what you can call a huge Trigger fanboy, so I advise you to cautiously take this as enthusiasm, as guidance, or even just as a piece of experience that a viewer had for BNA.<br />
<br />
BNA is a freaking delight, but for reasons different from my profile picture. If there&#039;s one thing that could overcome my furry bias, it is my appreciation for the craft of Trigger studio. That said, I know this anime has evident flaws, and I will be judging it appropriately... after I shower it with praise and love.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (9/10):<br />
I believe there are legitimate grounds for saying that the plot of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338921">
        anime feels tame. I, for one, felt it too, but perhaps for reasons different than most. Upon the near end of the anime, I began to feel like this is a tamer version of the concept of Kill la Kill. It has been spurred strongly by the nature of identity and self-acceptance that BNA fiercely integrated within its story and very conflict. In hindsight, I think rather than as a flaw, it is more of a Trigger trope at this point.<br />
Here is why I am embracing it instead. BNA did not feel pretentious. Much of the acceptance I felt from Kill la Kill (despite being about the strange connection with clothes), was translated very well in the format of beastmen in BNA. I believe this goes with the fact that the utilization of anthropomorphism did not feel like some random choice. It is tied very well with what the anime wanted to portray and wanted to be. BNA would not be complete without the beastmen aspect, much like Kill la Kill would not be striking without its recklessness with its clothes symbolism. It&#039;s a classic Trigger kind of exaggeration that feels strangely wholesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character (9/10):<br />
To relate with the previous aspect, I believe this is where the utilization of the beastmen aspect shines the strongest, particularly the philosophy of the characters and their ways of dealing with conflicts. This comes across especially striking due to the various natures of the character &quot;types&quot; being human, beastmen, hybrids and everything in between. This is where a lot of anime material aiming to be inspiration falls flat. However, BNA makes it so that the characters are grounded with reason and logic, where seeing both flaws and reality in character perceptions are able to be given empathy, but not necessarily agreement. This makes for compelling character dynamic, no matter how frustrating it gets.<br />
That said, I am sure this will be a point of conflict for other viewers, because it does come to a point where it seems horribly cliche in nature. For me, going back, I think people underestimate the effectiveness of using tropes. People see it as an unnecessary format, but rarely see it as an effective means to convey story and build up in a more convenient way. This is especially important for BNA due to its short runtime, where much of the main characters main frameworks are quickly explained for efficiency, while still leaving room for the parts of mysteries and plot developments. Plus, Michiru is simply too memorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10):<br />
Absolutely love the energy here! It goes very well with the Trigger dynamic, so the chemistry is strong and it is very infectious! I wish there could have been stronger song themes for the tamer parts of the anime, but this is enough for the wild pacing and setup of the anime!<br />
<br />
<br />
Art (8/10):<br />
If I have to pick one anime to introduce people to Trigger, this will be it. For the nth time of mentioning, Kill la Kill is obviously not for the faint of heart. BNA, on the other hand, will be holding a special kind of fondness in my heart, and probably even for other people. It&#039;s the now typical Trigger stylization, but somehow remarkably defined well with its integration of animal characteristics. It feels like a legitimate and respectful take on anthropomorphism without appearing as pandering (the fanservice in this anime is very mild). While not for every episode, there are some strong visuals here and there. I would have to criticize the studio for placing some obvious budget cuts over some particular frames (not necessarily animation itself, but it counts for an art critique), especially for a short anime that needed the most it can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (9/10), I fully acknowledge and embrace my bias. Despite a good amount of flaws, my enjoyment far outweighs my sentiments for negativity over the material. I see BNA as a more family-friendly way of playing around with the theme of acceptance, as opposed to the aggressive take of Kill la Kill. But surprisingly, I don&#039;t think I will endorse this anime due to its &quot;furry&quot; aspects (Beastars, on the other hand...). I think it is a disservice to the anime to advertise this as merely that. It is a Trigger delight, much like the rest. It is a wild ride, and I will always be appreciative of anime that takes on the lesser uniform approach. I hope that more people will be involved with and look forward to more of their projects. They certainly delivered with this one!

    Honestly this show is certainly fun and enjoyable! It&#039;s made me so hype for when the next episode comes out! So already from that basis, you should check out the show yourself! It&#039;s a blast, so give it a go! But here is why!<br />
<br />
The sound...While the sound hits most marks when it comes to certain scenes, what I really love is the opening itself. It&#039;s catchy, is great to listen to. I hope other shows this upcoming season&#039;s openings are just as good.<br />
<br />
The art style is so colourful and bright, so pleasing to see. They&#039;ve really done a good job on making sure the art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332644">
        looks so dazzling. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s gonna look even more good as future episodes come out.<br />
<br />
The characters and story in general. We&#039;re presented with a poor treasure that is Michiru, whom is just a blessing. She&#039;s upbeat, she&#039;s determined, and easy to root for. Such a pleasant character. Combine that with the serious and dedicated Shirou, along with more characters that really mesh well together. You&#039;re in for a treat honestly.<br />
<br />
The story, the way it presents itself. Just leaves me wondering what else this world offers. If you&#039;re into corruption in higher ups, general mystery in surroundings when it comes to certain things such as the city itself, or characters backgrounds, or curious on interesting worlds in general. Then you&#039;ll love this show, as it offers much interest in so many ways as I&#039;ve just described. If an anime always leaves you curious and interested in whats going on, then it&#039;s doing it&#039;s job.<br />
<br />
Defo gonna keep watching, and you should too!

    &quot;BNA: Brand New Animal&quot; was the latest &quot;Studio Trigger&quot; Anime, which means epic fights, quirky characters, fast-paced tune, cool animation, a soundtrack that increases the EPIC factor, and an overall &quot;Rule Of cool&quot; series that is more style over substance... Right?<br />
<br />
Well, yeah, but similar to their last project, &quot;Promare&quot;,  it feels uncreative and inspired.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Similar to most of the works of the studio, start off with 3 episodes that establish the set-up and concepts, then is episodic for a couple of episodes to gradually develop a plot.<br />
<br />
The most obvious of the problems is the pacing of the story, because of his extremely short duration, there&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338968">
        no time to assimilate all the themes and events that are happening, it simply goes way too fast, making every event feel unimportant.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot of themes going on in the show, like beastmen being an allegory to jews and the holocaust, and the message of racism and the allegory of white supremacy. It simply bites more than it can chew, making everything feel like decorations...<br />
<br />
The show also has a big problem with his tune, because of the fact that It wants to address all of these topics without being too adult or too serious, make the whole thing pretentious.<br />
<br />
Another thing is the obvious plot devices and Deus-ex-machinas every time there&#039;s a conflict. Michiru needs to be saved, so she is not gonna activate her powers, but when the show needs it, she is gonna, coincidentally, being able to fly.<br />
<br />
It isn&#039;t subtle at all, the show screams you in the face who is the villain, what are his message. The way it ended feels anti-climatic since all get resolved just because of Michiru and OOgami getting a power-up after power-up and the infinity amounts of asspulls in just one episode.&quot;Michiru can transform into any beastmen because the plot needs it&quot;, &quot;Michiru learns she can do this and this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Without saying all of the logical-failures and plot-holes that the show creates during the whole show.<br />
<br />
So, beastmen can turn into humans? why they simply don&#039;t do that to fix in human society? the family of the villain does that and they apparently control the whole HUMAN SOCIETY in the shadows (being this an allegory of secret organizations and shit like that), so, why the others don&#039;t do that?<br />
<br />
so, this beastmen syndrome that makes everyone turn into a giant monster exist since the beginning? then it actually makes sense and the best option is to convert everyone in humans. Okay, the current generation has a vacuum, but the new generations are still gonna born with the syndrome and there&#039;s a possibility that they became immune to the medicine.<br />
<br />
Also, why humans have to accept beastmen traditions and nature, but beastmen can&#039;t adapt or even live together with the human&#039;s traditions, it feels amazingly one-side, since it is literally saying that humans are awful just because they can&#039;t attend ALL the necessities of another specie.<br />
<br />
The amount of exposition is also a great problem with this, they literally stop like 5 minutes to explain something that doesn&#039;t make sense and is just an asspull.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
They are archetypes, nothing really wrong with that...<br />
<br />
The problem starts off with the fact that all of them are clones of the characters of &quot;Little Witch Academia&quot;. Michiru is Akko, both in personality, voice, and character design, the same with Oogami, that is just a clone of Andrew.<br />
<br />
They don&#039;t have chemistry as a duo since the show goes way too fast and doesn&#039;t show us interactions with the characters, again, because it is too fast.<br />
<br />
The characters became friends out of nowhere, fight out of nowhere, hate each other out of nowhere, love each other out of nowhere, it doesn&#039;t feel organic.<br />
<br />
As stand-alone characters, they aren&#039;t good, Michiru is a mary sue, Oogami is pretty dumb is you think about it. &quot;I want to protect all beastmen but instead of stoping the bomb, I&#039;m gonna chase the guys who put the bomb instead of first stoping the tool that will kill everyone and use that as evidence for the investigation&quot;, is as retarded as if sound.<br />
<br />
The cast is one-dimensional, all of them since they don&#039;t change to the length of the story and... the good guys are good and bad guys are bad.<br />
<br />
All of the other characters are plot devices that will appear in the exact moment that the show needs it.  It literally just introduce characters to guard them and use them in the latest episodes.<br />
<br />
The villain is pretty boring since his motivation is pretty unclear, is amazing how they didn&#039;t use his boring exposition for this,  and, he is basically that shadow antagonist that the writers are making you believe that he is not bad and that the villain is someone else when it is pretty obvious that the villain is him. The plot twist, in the end, doesn&#039;t make that much of a sense. If he were human, it would be understandable that he wants to destroy all beastmen, but since he is also a beastmen and a powerful one, with the government of Japan in his side, why not simply taking over AnimaCity and forcing everyone to be human except for him?<br />
<br />
and last but not least.... it has the same problems that promare.<br />
<br />
In Promare, the themes and concepts are the same as &quot;Kill La Kill/Gurren Laggan/Little Witch Academia&quot;, here the characters and their roles are the same as &quot;Beastars&quot; and &quot;Zootopia&quot;, in fact, most of the themes of the show are simplified of themes seen in Zootopia or Beastars. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
I loved the aesthetic of the show, the color palette fits amazing with the overall mood of the story, and it helps to create an atmosphere of mystery and political-action of the show.<br />
<br />
Similar to the other works of the studio, the animation is limited in the great part and amazingly fluid in the most crucial moments, it works really well. Everything is dynamic, bombastic, and fast-paced, to the point is never gonna bored you.<br />
<br />
I love how the ending looks like, the background art and the especially the colors are so well done.<br />
<br />
In the negative part of the things, I found the world a little bit un-imaginative, is not like beastars or Zootropia, the scenario could have been a lot more creative, in terms of character design is pretty disappointing. Michiru is a clone of Akko and Oogami is a clone of Andrew, the rest of the characters are a bunch of  other characters from other Gainax/Trigger shows (Satsuki, Sucy, Nonon)<br />
<br />
I  like the aesthetic, I like the color palette and I like the overall style, but I found it uncreative.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack fits with the atmosphere of the shows and the musical themes are really well done, they are catchy, well-composed, and, again, fits with the whole mood.<br />
<br />
Voice acting is normal, fits with the character, but at the same time is nothing really remarkable (As I said before, Michiru sounds just like Akko).<br />
<br />
the mix and the arrangements are perfect and it has good use of the tempos. Nothing really wrong in this place.<br />
<br />
Overall, BNA is a mess, the pacing is awful, it is full of Asspull and argumental conveniences, there&#039;s no real character development, plot holes, and... It is pretty dry. <br />
<br />
Everything that the show wants to do was already made by Zootopia and Beastars in a better way (at least, everything there makes sense), and since the characters are just clones from Little Witch Academia, there&#039;s nothing really here to remember.<br />
<br />
It is not fun and creative like Kill La Kill, it doesn&#039;t explore any themes like Gurren Laggan and it doesn&#039;t have good characters like Little Witch Academia... It is just another failure to trigger to revive old glories. <br />
<br />

    10/10 - You don&#039;t want to sleep out on this anime. While it may have only 6 episodes at the time being and more on the way, it left me wanting more after each episode.<br />
<br />
Pro&#039;s<br />
- Character Progression and Personality<br />
- OST and sound is amazing and great to listen to<br />
- Art and animation is very smooth and nice<br />
- Story<br />
<br />
Con&#039;s<br />
- None i can think of ATM.<br />
<br />
Overall while the story is straight forward there is still more episodes to go so there may be twists and turns along the way. Either way this is a very enjoyable anime to watch. Do try to ignore the lower ratings, most

    To the question of whether BNA is a *smart* anime, I answer with this: there is a three-second crowd scene in the first episode, unrelated to the main plot, showing an anthropomorphic rock band in Sgt. Pepper uniforms and vaporwave sunglasses. A horse plays lead guitar and has hooves for hands. A rooster has wing-mitts and plays bass. A cat&#039;s on the keyboard, and a terrier&#039;s on drums. The horse has three ponytails. This is, by far, the most thought-through scene in the entire series. To the question of whether BNA is a *fun* anime, I invite you to re-read this paragraph. In short, yes.<br />
Studio

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333755">
        Trigger is all about fun, and they&#039;ve used their love languages of dynamic action, bright color, and cheeky sentiment to speak on the genre du jour: animals, aka anthropomorphism, aka animal-human relations, aka third-wave furries. There isn&#039;t too much horsepower in BNA&#039;s animal/human story engine-- Trigger&#039;s real contribution to the topic is their top-tier animation, particularly in action and comic scenes, excellent OPs and EDs, and a sumptuous pink/blue color scheme, which warms my heart to see in an action-oriented show.<br />
<br />
Scene by scene, BNA feels less manic and improvisational than earlier Trigger works like Kill La Kill, Inferno Cop, and Space Patrol Luluco, and mercifully less self-important than weaker Trigger efforts like Darling in the FranXX or Kiznaiver. BNA&#039;s closest relative inside Trigger would be Little Witch Academia, because both are a solid success in what they set out to be: a garland of light adventures, strung together loosely but comfortably.<br />
<br />
As always, here are some alternative and follow-up shows:<br />
If you want a story with stronger use of animal elements as a lens for differences of power, gender, and class, look to Beastars.<br />
If you want more goofy buddy-cop dynamics, try Cop Craft, though the flavor is elves rather than animals.<br />
If the impactful action scenes moved you, try Trigger&#039;s movie Promare, or predecessor works like Kill La Kill or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.<br />
For a kid-friendly show by the same folks cruising at more or less the same gear, try Little Witch Academia.

    People in the furry community has non-stopped talking about this show and saying it it&#039;s the best anime of 2020. So I watched it for myself and all I can say is this show...was not good, like, I don&#039;t see how is this good? And as a furry, I am insulted how this show went. Here&#039;s my full review:<br />
<br />
Story: Honestly, from how it started, the story was actually decent. The world was segregated by 2 races: the humans and the beastmen, and the humans that turned into beastmen goes to a city called Animacity where people can be beastmen however they like and the backstory

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339416">
        explained the world. However, this is where the downfall is. The show has a lot of plot holes like, how is the female MC able to turn invisible or gain super sense with no experience, there&#039;s couple of filler episodes, and the emphasis on racism wasn&#039;t tackled too heavily, the same situation on RWBY season 5 where we didn&#039;t get tackled nor see any hints of racism and just put it there for no reason. Like, how are we going to feel sympathy for either of these races of racism wasn&#039;t tackled too heavily in the story. That&#039;s kinda like a cop-out if you ask me. And even the ending feels rushed that they should&#039;ve reworked it.<br />
<br />
Characters: I wanted to like these characters, I really do. But I really, REALLY, hate the characters in this show; the side characters, the minor characters, or even the main protagonist in the show. The female MC is one of the most annoying, obnoxious, and unlikable character I&#039;ve ever seen. Shirou, the male MC, is one of the most boring, one-dimensional, no personality, stoic, unlikable, Edgy Emo Legoshi + Cloud Strife-like character, even his tiny backstory couldn&#039;t make it up for it. Most of the side characters have no purpose nor contribute anything to the plot. But not only the protagonist, the antagonist (who I&#039;m not gonna spoil) is terrible too. No backstory, no reason to be evil, and one of the most generic motive in the show, even his own idea comes to bite him back in the arse. Such a terrible villain.<br />
<br />
Animation/Art/Design: I like anime, and I like art, I really do. But this has to be the WORST animated show that I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s like a child drew most of the season. Like, wtf? Disproportioned limbs, facial expressions, and character design, like, jesus did they not think this through? Shirou, given the clothes they chose, he looks like child predator when you give him a trench coat and black gloves. And you know why he keeps the female MC with him. And iirc, isn&#039;t she a minor? Speaking of which, I REALLY hate how they give Shirou in his clotheless furry form an ugly look up to the point that it rectifies his design that he was given while he was wearing clothes.<br />
<br />
Before I get to the overall points, I want to point this out. not ALL furries enjoys this show because there&#039;s furries in it, and I&#039;m the prior example of this. I HATED this show. I&#039;ve already listed the problems what&#039;s going on with it and yet the furry fandom are defending it because of Shirou. I DON&#039;T like Shirou. Not only him, but characters outside of BNA who has the same boring personality like Mercenary/Yohei &amp; Legoshi. Those characters I really hate and do you know why? They have the same personality and yet people are defending them because they&#039;re furries. Stop it, just stop it. I&#039;ve seen other furry characters like, my main husbando/best waifu, Ricardo Welkin, Wolfy from Legendz, and Hound Dog from MHA have outgoing, charming, and BETTER personalities then those cardboard cutouts. But no, they like them because they&#039;re edgy and emo. Just stop with it, please. What&#039;s wrong with your like?<br />
<br />
Overall: What I think of it? I hate it to death. I&#039;ve never watched a single Studio Trigger and I hate those shows as well because I&#039;m not a perverted SJWs like most people are. Why the studio, who is not well known, never defunct in the 1st place and is still going despite that they never made a single good anime in their life? There are other well known like UFOtable, J.C, White Fox, Mappa, A1, Madhouse, Bones, and Pierrot? All of you need to stop with the closed-minded idea of &quot;if it&#039;s made by Trigger, it&#039;s a 10/10.&quot; because that excuse isn&#039;t gonna work. What do I rated? A 3/10.

    I want to base this on what the anime IS rather than what it could have been. That said, I really enjoyed BNA. The characters were compelling, the universe was intriguing, the art was stunning, and while the anime didn&#039;t accomplish anything particularly revolutionary, I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. It was a good concept with some parts that could have been elaborated on or explored more, but in 12 episodes, I still got a good sense of the world at large, the challenges characters faced, and the overarching themes. For a 12-episode anime, the plot was really well-done with a good amount of build and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338993">
        a satisfying (although some might say lackluster) resolution. Character design was 10/10 with diverse body types and a stunning lack of hyper-sexualization. Music was very good. Art and animation, incredible, especially during the scenes with more action. Some heavy topics such as prejudice, discrimination, and eugenics, but they didn&#039;t feel glossed over or heavy-handed which was refreshing.<br />
<br />
This review is pretty scattered, but in short, certainly not the best anime in the world but definitely worth watching.

    *COMPLETE REVIEW OF EPISODES 1-12*<br />
<br />
First off, I want to mention that BNA is my first Trigger show, and I intend to share my thoughts on the show based on its own merits without this infamous studio’s work in mind. That being said, I’m definitely looking forward to exploring Trigger’s catalogue further. One more thing, this first bit is going be spoiler-free, but I’ll include some specific details at the end, so read at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Brand New Animal (BNA) brought up plenty of discussion among the community when the project first got announced. An anime-original story, backed with a Netflix release? That’s just unheard of!*

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338902">
        Jokes aside, news about the show and its premise did pique my interest. Was I pumped for the show? Yes. Did I have a good time? Sure did. Was the hype warranted in the end? …Not quite, IMO.<br />
<br />
Let’s get this out of the way: BNA absolutely nails its presentation. The art mixes overall vibrance with moments highlighting individual color tones, keeping the scenes looking anything but mundane. Animation here is free-flowing and complemented with careful shot composition, which makes the action and pivotal confrontations stand out. The sound design is great, and the score is really well implemented. The OP slaps, and I can never bring myself to skip the ED. Overall, these elements are executed incredibly well, making for a fun show that I can easily recommend.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, I have a few problems with BNA regarding its writing and series structure. BNA’s premise is a big draw for the series, but unfortunately I never got the feeling that the show fully delivered on its potential. The broad issue I have is that the show’s overarching plot is too thin and stretched out, leaving little room for tension and only having a couple of compelling story beats. This certainly isn’t helped by the show’s unusual release schedule. BNA is essentially split in half and premiered the first 6 episodes back in March. I watched the show in-line with the Netflix broadcast, and it had this disjointing effect, with mostly inconsequential “filler” episodes frontloaded and more exposition-heavy material in the latter half. Note I say “filler” loosely (there’s only one egregious case)**, in the sense that the show raised some interesting ideas that didn’t really mean anything or arrive at a meaningful conclusion in the end. Our protagonist Michiru meets the indestructible badass Shirou and spend the initial episodes exploring the crime syndicate known as The Family. Through these experiences, Michiru comes to gain a grasp of the nature of Beastmen. That one tangent alone would have been sufficient to service a whole cour of the show, balancing that buddy cop relationship and character introspection for Michiru, the human-turned-beast. That was the show I was expecting, but then the show just leaves that thread hanging. Instead, the show chooses to shoehorn in new characters, giving the show a looser feel and lessening the impact of potentially strong material. While that in itself is not an issue, I feel that BNA is a bit of a tease for only briefly hinting at these ideas without committing to them. This lack of narrative focus may be less of problem if you’re binging the show and is mostly dealt with two-thirds into its run, so make of this mini-rant what you will.<br />
<br />
Now, to quickly address a few specific problems, mostly having to do with the points mentioned above. The worldbuilding in the show varies quite a bit, as good ideas can get tossed in one episode while the next may see Beastmen doing human things the exact same way humans would. Conflict within the characters in the show seem inconsequential unless fangs are bared, with one exception coming at the end of episode 6. The characters themselves are fine and serviceable, not exactly bland but not interesting either.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: What do I think of BNA? Although I’ve attempted to give this show a good bashing, that’s only because of what I thought it could have been. And I believe I’m not alone in thinking that BNA could have been so much more. Story threads that weren’t given enough room to grow, themes that weren’t comprehensively explored, and a world not fully realised hold BNA back from making much of an impact. That being said, solid production from a renowned studio and genuinely fun moments keep things engaging. BNA might not be a beast in contention for AOTY or anything, but it’s certainly fine for what it is. Trigger could have done a lot worse here, and there is always a place in the anime landscape for this level of creativity. BNA, for what it’s worth, is a fun ride, and I think in these times we could all use a little light in our lives. 6/10~<br />

STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):<br />
- *that is, unheard of for roughly two seasons. The comparisons between this show and Carole and Tuesday run deeper than Netflix and the release schedule; C&amp;T also has the pattern of episodic romps in the first half and a more plot-oriented second. However, with C&amp;T the tone shift was more nonsensical, and it tried to go from Folk Tik Tok songs to…  a discussion on immigration? Still trying to wrap my head around that one.<br />
- **my GOD I hate the baseball episode, why does it exist<br />
- I want to punt Jackie across a room, why does it exist<br />
- Said it once and I’ll say it again, “NIGHT RUNNING” deserves to be put on loop. Spotify, we’re waiting.<br />
- The Nirvasyl flashback sequence in Episode 8 was really good. Great idea to switch up the art style, there was a frame or two in there reminiscent of Genndy Tartakovsky’s best work.<br />
- Best Girl: If I had to choose, probably Nazuna. Her interpreting being the face of a cult to her aspirations of becoming an idol is probably the most interesting idea in the show.<br />
- In A Nutshell: Zootopia meets the Powerpuff Girls (with a dash of Major 2nd**)<br />
- Greetings Internet! Just a small-time anime fan here, I’m trying out some stuff in this community and sharing my ill-informed opinions. This is my first review and at the moment I’m satisfied with it, although I have a feeling I’ll regret this whole idea a week from now. Looking forward to doing more of these reviews here and there, I don’t watch a ton of shows seasonally though. In any case I hope you enjoyed this piece and that it gave you something to chew on. I do want to get better at this, so if you have any feedback feel free to let me know, peace!

    Studio Trigger is back at it again. Everything the studio touches seems to either hit or miss. This was definitely a hit. <br />
<br />
The art is easily deserving of the 9 I&#039;ve given it. Out of all the shows whilst excluding movies, this show looks slick and the characters move creatively in the classic Trigger style. There is a very effective use of colour and sound, especially in the earlier episodes. <br />
The atmosphere gets built well throughout the course of what we have thus far, especially the city-scape vibe it seems to put on you as you watch. Locations become familiar and scenes last just the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336561">
        expected amount of time.<br />
<br />
The only setback is that episodes will take a while to release, and we won&#039;t have Netflix viewing until late 2020. The release schedule is a drawback that was originally unanticipated.<br />
<br />
Some of the characters lack in depth or personality, and the lead character acts too often on the trope of &quot;what she thinks is right&quot;. Some characters seem comically invincible at times, along with the fact that depth is missing in some aspects.<br />
<br />
Overall, a very good series, especially out of what we have this season. I&#039;m excited to see what Trigger does next with this.

    I feel likes shows with animal/beastman have been coming out a lot in medias this pass years. I started realising this after Zootopia, they use the difference between species or canivor/herbivores as a tool to talk about the issues of our society. At first, I was scare that BNA fall into that, because I don&#039;t think this trope has more to bring to the table. Unfortunately BNA fall into this trope, but at my surprise it has so mush more to offer. ( Explanation of the trope in the case of BNA: There is a conflict between human and beastman, and by that  I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334687">
        mean that a lot of human want to see the beastmans dead. Depending on your point view you could actually interpret this as a metaphor for racisim or the scare of  difference, similar to Somali and the forest spirit)<br />
<br />
I would say that the conflict of human and the beastman serve more as a toll for the setting of the world than the subject of the story. For fact the main character has no intention/goal of changing anything about this (at least for the moment). She want to change her current status and become like she was before, and that my friends is were this show is more thought provoking than the others Trigger shows. The mains characters are all selfish in their own ways, even in their altruism. It was pointed out by Nazuna that Michiru (MC) is actually selfish by jumping on assumption and acting on it and help her ego by being the hero. When You think about it, everything she do is for her (not that it&#039;s a bad thing). Mostly she want to cure her disease and  become human again, but she able to forget about her goal if there is something more fun to do. This place Michiru in a quite childish light, but at the same time, she is courageous and can show some maturity through her childish act. I need to give that to them, Michiru is quite a good representation of a teenager ( I feel that the  line between too mature and to childish while creating a teenager character is very tight and Michiru is right in the sweet spot). <br />
In the case of Ogami,  his selfishness (or maybe childish side?) is represented in is mantra of protecting the beastman community, everyone going against the good of the beastman will be treated indifferently even if they are beastmam themselves. (When I think about it, the way he do his justice is similar to L) He is quite mysterious and there&#039;s definitely something special about him like our MC when it come to their abilities.<br />
<br />
Directing:<br />
The show is made quite episodic with the main plot going on it the background or the mystery. I would say it is a step up from Kill la Kill and little witch academia, but it&#039;s too soon to actually make a proper verdict. Didn&#039;t Really see something that stick out has exceptional, but the fak that there is not major directing mistakes is good.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
I am totally loving this show. It&#039;s fun visually, with the aesthetic of Trigger that I always appreciate (colourful and explosive). I enjoy the main character, I don&#039;t know how to describe it, but it just pure fun following her adventure. (Her face is so hilarious too). The baseball episode was amazing, it was like is own little thing with is own  conclusion and character development.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just realized that I didn&#039;t talk about character development! It&#039;s too see a proper development, the only evolution would be that Michiru has pass from wanting to transform or becoming human again tk actually liking her beast form. (To be expected)<br />
<br />
Spoiler/ speculation ahead!!!<br />
<br />
Just want to come back on something:<br />
The plot with the main character being Yokai beastmans spice the thing, a bit like Tokyo ghoul, but this time you&#039;re wandering if there is some kind of Doctor making super beastman (because we didn&#039;t see one yet). I thought at first that Michiru was going to be all the animals at the same time by the way she transform, but seeing Nazuna being a Kitsune, Michiru is probably  just a Tanuki that can change form like the yokai in the Japanese folklore.<br />

                                  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS <br />
<br />
<br />
Humans and animals. Different views on the world, different meanings behind their actions, one relying purely on instinct, the other on logical thinking. These two worlds seem like direct parallels but are inherently the same. <br />
<br />
BNA is a show that is probably the most unconventional thing the anime medium has offered in recent times along with Beastars, offering a new viewpoint on many relevant themes and problems in today’s world from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review379343">
        racism all the way to fascism, BNA tackles multiple ideologies. <br />
<br />
Like a classic episodic anime, we are introduced to the characters and the world they live in in the first few episodes while the plot only progresses in the last few. BNA failed horribly at executing the last part of its story with an underwhelming reveal and a predictable, satisfactory ending which was foreseeable from the start. <br />
<br />
While putting strong emphasis on the dark aspects of this Beastman society in the first few episodes, BNA quickly abolishes those themes and sticks to the Good vs Bad guys near the end of its run, the dark side of this society remains unexplored, only shallowly dug into in the form of gambling, stereotypes and racism, the story had much more potential to develop in a natural way instead of forcing a happy ending which did not feel rewarding at all and was plainly and lazily executed. <br />
<br />
BNA still does some things right in the form of exploring the world and the Beastmen themselves, their culture and way of life. We follow Michiru, a girl who knows nothing about Animacity or the Beastmen at all. We learn about the world through her eyes, at her pace and with her. And while some information was dumped out too fast and did not feel important at all, most of it was delivered nicely in the form of Michiru herself going on adventures around this city and meeting its residents, getting familiar with their culture, fighting against the dark market of the city. <br />
<br />
Michiru is a stereotypical protagonist, righteous and foolish, easily manipulated but likeable. Her development comes in the form of accepting the beast she has become, the tanuki within her and making use of this odd body that she was given. Every time Michiru becomes friends with someone, she “unlocks” a new ability, a new way of making her stronger, she develops in a way. While learning to accept herself and her body, it all feels underwhelming, it is known from the start that she has some mysterious power that will grant her the ability to save the world, making the whole process of her growth feel less significant and more of a thing that would have happened eventually no matter what. She was overall a good character, just a lazily written one. <br />
<br />
BNA’s biggest problem is its lazy writing. The story itself and the characters in it felt like they all could have gotten bigger reveals, more depth or just overall personality. Most of them felt like a stereotypical slice of life episodic anime characters. From the evil guy that turns out to be the thing he hates the most, to the nice Mayor that observes everything and is a support to our protagonist with nothing to add whatsoever. The series felt like it could have given a lot more significance to the characters themselves, instead of focusing on the dark themes of the world it ended up completely abandoning in its later episodes. <br />
<br />
Shirou, BNA’s saving grace. As he conflicts with himself after failing to accomplish his only life goal, we get to see the cold and emotionless Shirou finally open up, his history revealing that he is in fact Ginrou, the guardian deity of Beastmen. His inner conflict represents the dark side that everyone has, but in classic anime fashion, the good side came on top and Shirou was able to conquer his doubts and save the world together with our fearless, happy, likeable main character, Michiru, leaving the series feeling disappointing. <br />
<br />
Studio Trigger delivered once again, atleast in the animation and musical departments. While definitely not their best work visually, BNA is still a pleasure to watch, with a beautiful and darkish color palette, sticking to the series’ themes, it helps enhance the overall experience and allows BNA to dig out of the grave it dug itself into. The Opening and Ending were beautiful, while the ending feels underwhelming visually in comparison to the Opening, it still provides a nice transition between episodes. The Opening is probably the best out of the 2020 lineup, both visually and musically being a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
Trigger is a studio praised by some, hated by others. I personally find myself in between, they sometimes allow their animation prowess to take their show to a new level, sometimes they simply choose the wrong story to fit their masterpiece animation. BNA is one of those shows. It had immense potential but ended up wasting it on creating a lackluster closing to the series and setting itself in place as one of many Studio Trigger works that simply did not reach the highs that it should have. <br />
<br />
I came into BNA not expecting much, and that is what I got. A quick twelve episode watch that did not do anything special, while it is worth a watch, it is nowhere close to Trigger’s best works and is somewhere in the middle of the 2020 season, which was lackluster in itself. Overall a good anime, but one that should not have ended the way it did.

    My initial impression of the art direction was cute but the animation spoiled it and over time it became less endearing. I do not like this show. I like Beastars. Why aren&#039;t they horny? Where is Legoshi? Why isn&#039;t this like Beastars? Why can&#039;t they just make a good show? The animation is appalling and lazy.  They reuse frames and animation. I just wanted another cool anime show but all I got was this. I&#039;m incredibly disappointed. Every episode tries to create a conflict and the mean dog man comes in at the end to solve all the issues. There&#039;s no urgency causing the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352395">
        plot to continue- things just happen without any flow. I have not seen the whole show but I do not know if I will finish it. I probably will force myself and my friend to finish watching as a form of punishment for even considering this atrocious show. I just don&#039;t understand why it can&#039;t be like Beastars? I can&#039;t wait for season 2 of Beastars, it comes out in January of 2021. Every single night I pray that I slip into a coma until January 2021 for season 2 of Beastars. BNA has disrupted my ability to sleep because I can&#039;t stop thinking about the terrible animation and plot directions. I just want my tall wolf bf. Also I totally ship haru x legoshi x louis. Marie is ok. She&#039;s cute and I hope that she finds a girlfriend. I have nothing wrong with her other than the few times she&#039;s animated poorly. I guess the music is okay and the art style is fine. <br />
<br />
Anyways, true Beastars fan out. <br />

PS I&#039;m not a furry.<br />
