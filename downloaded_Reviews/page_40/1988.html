    The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children&#039;s programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever.<br />
<br />
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14996">
        haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo.<br />

The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season.<br />
<br />
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term &quot;filler&quot; episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline.<br />
<br />
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own &quot;true self&quot; I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most &quot;real&quot; anime character I’ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu&#039;s guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu&#039;s rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu.<br />
<br />
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try.<br />

    Any fan of Mahou Shoujo anime should really enjoy Shugo Chara!, especially since it&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve seen a Mahou Shoujo anime which has more plot than using sparkle rays to blast some monsters.<br />
<br />
Shugo Chara! has all the classic Mahou Shoujo elements; blasting away a similar enemy in fillers, overly long transformation sequences, a &amp;quot;chosen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; heroine, and the classic idea of making enemies into friends.<br />
<br />
But Shugo Chara! has what a lot of Mahou Shoujo seem to be missing. A nice message and some good romance. It&#039;s not just about blasting away the enemy, it&#039;s about a young girls confusion over her

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4317">
        &amp;quot;true self,&amp;quot; something that a lot of people can probably identify with. Amu also finds herself confused very often over what she&#039;s feeling over certain guys in her life. After all, good shoujo needs a nice love triangle, doesn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
All of the characters in Shugo Chara! are also incredibly entertaining. The Guardians, Easter&#039;s two pawns Ikuto and Utau, and certainly Amu herself. Even the fillers are mildly fun to watch...if you&#039;re not looking for substance, but just fun.<br />
<br />
Overall, Shugo Chara! is a good anime to watch. It&#039;s been compared to great anime like CardCaptor Sakura, and while I wouldn&#039;t go that far, it is definitely the best Mahou Shoujo anime in a while and it does have the appeal to span multiple ages (I&#039;ve encountered fans from ages 10-30). So, if you&#039;re a fan of mahou shoujo, or just shoujo in general, you really can&#039;t miss Shugo Chara! (though, I will just leave off mentioning the fillers to warn any impatient viewers).

    This is my first review so please stay with me:<br />
<br />
Shugo Chara,<br />
When I first saw the description I must admit I was skeptical. For one thing it revolves around an elementary student, and for another it was labled under romance. (I watch a ton of High School Drama&#039;s so I&#039;m always on the lookout for a good romance anime)<br />
<br />
I clicked on episode one and figured &amp;quot;Eh, why not give it a try&amp;quot;.  Within the first two seconds I almost stopped it.<br />
&amp;quot;All kids have an egg in their soul&amp;quot;..... You can see where im coming from?<br />
But I didn&#039;t, I stuck to it. And I am so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3668">
        glad I did.<br />
<br />
This anime has me on the edge of my seat and I can&#039;t wait until the next episode comes out. For one thing It does have a great romance plot developing, (Ikuto Tsukiyomi is soooo hot *Im not a fangirl, i swear*) and, although the story is cheesy sometimes, something about it has just hooked me and I cannot stop watching it.<br />
<br />
So, basically what im trying to say is, Give this anime a try.<br />
You may love it,<br />
You may hate it,<br />
You may become obssesed with it (Which is actually quite easy to do)<br />
However you react, you have to at least give this anime a shot.<br />
<br />
Im glad I did.

The story is about somebody know as a cool girl, Amu. But it is not her real being self. On a day she finds 3 eggs out them coming Ran, Miki and Suu her 3 charackters how she wanna be. When she joins te guardians she get the job as a joker and find the x eggs but of course there are allot of problems do deal with...<br />

    I don&#039;t feel like sugar coating this, so I&#039;ll just come out and say it: I hated Shugo Chara. Despite the pages of praise, the only thing I found I actually liked about this were the characters. Not all of them, mind. Just five or six. <br />
<br />
The premise was cute, I&#039;ll admit, having a special place in your heart for who you want to be, and sometimes being able to meet that person. But by episode 30, I really wanted to stop watching it. By episode 35, I did, until someone told me the final arc of Doki was really good. Man, am I gullible.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review76323">
        The sad thing is, most of the fanfiction of this utilizes this idea in a better way than the canon story. <br />
<br />
Most episodes being filler didn&#039;t help, either. They even had a formula: Amu meets n, a person who is skilled at/in love with n. At/before a really important event, n will somehow mess up/be rejected, and a member of Easter will replace n&#039;s heart&#039;s egg with an X egg. Amu wil find the egg, make the same gasping noise, character transform,l then spew some stunningly cliche trite and purify n&#039;s heart egg. n then usually proceeds to never show his or her face again. They eventually do some variations, such as the x eggs hatching (Gasp.), or the X egg is a person&#039;s chara. Expanding on that more, if someone is not a Guardian or an employee of Easter ends up with a chara, you can bet it&#039;s going to become an X Egg. Out of the 50 episodes, I recall about 30 being filler.<br />
<br />
Characters in Shugo Chara vary greatly. Amongst the main cast, there was a pleasant diversity, although there were a few obnoxious characters. I&#039;m not talking about the reoccurring characters like Saaya, I&#039;m thinking of Kiseki. Was he supposed to be funny? He almost annoyed me as much as Tadase. Why did I find Tadase irritating? Because a main character should be memorable, but I can barely remember anything about him other Amu&#039;s endless fawning over him.<br />
<br />
Onto aesthetics! The art in Shugo Chara is fine, but there isn&#039;t anything truly outstanding. I liked most day to day outfits for the characters, Amu&#039;s in particular, but I disliked ALL of the character transformations, though. If I had to pick the absolute worst of the transformations, I&#039;d say Amulet Clover, Clown Drop, and Dear Baby. They missed cute by miles, and strayed far into the territories of awkwardness and stupidity. As for the music in the anime, the openings are all guaranteed starters of uncomfortable conversations. Generally, the sound track was unimpressive unless Ikuto was playing on his violin, or Utau was debuting a new song.<br />
<br />
So to sum up, Shugo Chara is an anime I might have enjoyed, however the huge portion of filler, and the general dragged out impression it gave me ruined it. For me, the show (including Doki!) was dull and altogether not worth the 102 episodes I struggled through, and certainly not deserving of the praise many of the reviews give it. The fact that so many animes I adore have run for a single season, while this one goes on for 3, with two of the seasons having double, or even quadruple times the amount of episodes as them really annoys me, especially as a simple story like this could have been done in half the episodes at double quality. I wouldn&#039;t really recommend this for a person who likes seeing characters ending up together  (due to how it has the most disappointing romance ending ever devised by man) , but if you&#039;re a magical girl fan, go nuts.

    Shugo Chara! is about a teenage girl named Hinamori Amu, who acts cool on the outside but is actually very shy. She wishes to become her would-be self and gets three shugo chara which are like guardian angels that represent your would be self. The story revolves around the guardians a soceity of people with shugo charas includingAmu and their adventures to find themselves and the ledgerndary Embryo which grants any wish.<br />
<br />
This anime has a unique storyline and is a pleasure to watch. Like any typical magical girl anime you have flashy transformation and destroying evil which takes the form of X eggs and characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9297">
        in this anime, because of this it can be a bit cliche. The story does have some interesting developments but it also contains a lo of fillers which can be quite annoying at times. It is lighthearted and comical with a tinge of drama.However, for such a long series the story still lacks depth and this could have been made up by using the filler episodes to create more developments in the story.<br />
<br />
The art was so-so. Nothing special, just your typical shuojo style characters with big eyes and varying hair styles.Nothing bad about it but nothing good either.<br />
<br />
The sound was also ok. I think the voice actors did a good job though and each character was fitted with the perfect voices(quite cute especially the shugo charas). Besides that the songs sung during the show by Utau were quite good. But other than that not much else was done to enhance the atmosphere through the songs.<br />
<br />
The characters were done up quite well partly due to the long span of the anime, most of the characters received some kind of depth and character development was visible throughoutthe show. Perhaps the fillers could have helped create even more depth for the characters. Even the villains get some depth. Very little romance is involved in this anime and is very suttle. Most of the interactions between the characters is merely friendly not intimate but there are some small occurences here and there.<br />
<br />
Overall, i think the anime was not not as good as i had anticipated because it lacked the depth for a long span of 51 episodes and the fillers were quite annoying towards the end with the anime not going anywhere. But it is an interesting anime to watch because many can identify with the theme of a would be self and there are some meaningful messages embedded in the anime. Hopefully the second series will outdo the first.

    This show is surprisingly long, I would not have imagined it was 51 episodes.  It&#039;s also quite hard to say why I like it.  It&#039;s a childish show, and the transformation of her character is overly dramatized.  I also hate how each episode starts with a weird voice saying &amp;quot;All kids have an egg in their soul...&amp;quot; in English.  The story is interesting, and has some plot twists, but not very many.  If you like light, easy-going shows with not much complications, then you will like Shugo Chara!  The art is also great.  I love how much detail

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3440">
        is everywhere, and the different outfits the characters wear when they &amp;quot;Chara-Change.&amp;quot;  Sounds are alright, I haven&#039;t really noticed them so they&#039;re not overly great, and not overly annoying.  Also, the time it takes for Amu-chan to do her &amp;quot;Chara-Change&amp;quot; is too long.  But pretty much any anime with transformations take a long time for the characters to transform.  Overall it&#039;s a great show and I would recommend it to anyone, guy or girl, even thou it&#039;s on the &#039;cute&#039; side.

    Alright..<br />
Since the first season of Shugo Chara is coming to a close.. I would like to grade it thus far.<br />
I might update this after the first season has finished airing<br />
<br />
Story : The story for Shugo Chara is your typical magical girl anime, and yet, it&#039;s not. You have the one girl who falls in love with a prince type character but cannot confess her love and nothing seems to go her way. But Amu is not the typical girl who nobody likes and doesn&#039;t fit in. No, she&#039;s the complete opposite. &#039;Cool and Spicy&#039; schoolgirl, Hinamori Amu, who doesn&#039;t know exactally how to act. Born

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6959">
        from these feelings were three eggs, and the story follows through there. Some parts can be pretty generic, but other parts have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.<br />
<br />
Art : I have heard that some people are not fond of the artwork, but I for one adore it. It&#039;s a very average style, nothing much to rave about and yet nothing to completely complain about. I still laugh at all of Amu&#039;s expressions though, the sparkles around Tadase, and Ikuto&#039;s generic &#039;I don&#039;t care&#039; glance. <br />
<br />
Sound : I love all of the voice actors for this series. Each one fits so very well. You also might recognize Ikuto Tsukiyomi&#039;s voice actor, who also played Tomoya Okazaki in Clannad. And Utau is voiced by the extremally talented singer, Nana Mizuki. All and all, the staff did an awesome job with this cast.<br />
<br />
Character : Characters. Characters. So many characters in Shugo Chara. Yet, all so unique, having some special attribute that when you hear a description word your mind automatically jumps to a specific character in Shugo Chara. I personally adore all the characters in my own way, some may have favorites and some may dislike a certain character to no end, but you&#039;ll certainly never forget them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : So far, I have really enjoyed Shugo Chara! It may have it&#039;s extreme ups and it can certainly have it&#039;s extreme downs, but I think many people will in fact, enjoy this series. There are rumors of a second season because of the increasing manga material and I am pretty sure I am going to watch and compare, telling you guys if you should stick around or if you should drop the series completely, but it&#039;s up to you to take the first step. Will you dare to try Shugo Chara?

    First Review<br />
<br />
At first, I wasn&#039;t sure if I should begin watching a maho shojo anime about elementary school characters. However, when I began watching it, I couldn&#039;t have been more wrong. The story, art, and sound were all above average, but what stuck out most was how well the characters were designed, and how much each character developed through the course of the story. However, the thing that held it down was just how much filler there was throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Shugo Chara tells the story of cool, and &quot;spicy&quot;, elementary student Amu Hinamori, who actually turns out to be a shy girl who has difficulty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187786">
        expressing herself. One day, she hears on TV about the guardian characters (shugo chara) that are always protecting them. The next day, she wakes up and find 4 eggs, each containing their own guardian character, and each a person that Amu wants to be. Throughout the story, she meets others with guardian characters, and X eggs, which are the guardian characters of those with no hope, which Amu has the power to purify, and the Embryo, the mysterious character egg the corporation Easter wants to get their hands on.<br />
<br />
<br />
To me, this is one of my favorite MANGA ever for a multitude of reasons. First of all, the characters and story were absolutely amazing, a romance that actually made sense, and some genuinely funny scenes. On the other hand, the art and music were only slightly above average unlike the latter. Flaws included the below average, slow, &quot;action&quot; scenes, that were honestly unneeded (you&#039;ll see what I mean if you watch the show).<br />
<br />
RANT<br />
*A few minor spoilers*<br />
 What killed the ANIME nearly entirely were the absolutely terrible amount of useless random characters and an entire unnecessary story arc in the anime. This extends the show far more than it needed to be, and really undermines Amu&#039;s special abilities and the X eggs introduced in the beginning. The supposedly rare and exclusive X eggs and Amu and the rest of the Guardians&#039; character transformations are completely put down. Most of the episodes are the same useless thing, in which the guardians find some random kid with a troubled mindset, who gets an X egg, and the guardians come purify them. This becomes worse, and more prevalent close to the end, and every time I saw the same garbage over and over, I wanted to put a gun to my head, because it nearly ruined how great Shugo Chara is supposed to be. <br />
<br />
In my opinion the manga is honestly the better of the two, as it retains everything great about Shugo Chara, but without the things that kept down the anime. However, if you simply don&#039;t like reading, then feel free to watch the anime, as it is still an enjoyable anime as long as you don&#039;t think to much in the many filler episodes.

    Shugo Chara! Stands out amoungst mahou shojou (magical girl) anime. While it appeases all aspects of mahou shoujo, girl with powers, transformations, roamance, &#039;cute&#039; themes and such it also includes just that little something that stands out so much.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The basic theme of every episode is simple, beat the bad guys, cleanse some eggs, drabble in romance and the such. However, Shugo Chara! has an over all story which brings the main cahracter, Amu, to the brink of depression and the theme of becoming ones true self is interesting. Rather than the story being about the powers and the magic and some war that&#039;s been going

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9913">
        on for years, the story is about the characters themselves, finding themselves and others. This is something that stands out for me.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The orignal style of Peach-Pit carries over to the anime. It&#039;s a sweet style that dosn&#039;t have the cliche &#039;my-eyes-are-twice-the-size-of-my-face&#039;. The proportions are nice and the characters are cute, suiting the anime perfectly!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I can&#039;t particully say I love the op&#039;s and ed&#039;s however they are fun. The voices are not ear splitting nor whining, it&#039;s very refreshing.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Amu is a character that impresses me alot. She isn&#039;t overly ditsy or loud. Instead she is character who eveyone thinks is cool and calm but is actually shy and cute. She reminds me of Ryuuji from ToraDora (looks like a deliquint but is actually quite kind). This is so rare in a magical girl it&#039;s also quite refreshing. <br />
Another thing that amazes me is the love triangles. This developed to the point of a RPG game! While she could fall for the prince, Tadase, her relationship with the cliche boy seems so shallow and a much deeper understanding is shown between her and Ikuto. But you never know.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall:<br />
I personally love this anime, it&#039;s a nice surprise and twist on the mahou shoujo genre that was much needed! Thankyou Peach-Pit!

    Shugo chara didn&#039;t caught my eyes in the first place. when i was surfing on crunchyroll.com i saw this anime being featured and it is an all time favourite.<br />
the first thing that came to my mind is &amp;quot; it look kinda childish, the pink hair girl is a kid so this should be a kiddy anime &amp;quot; . but later on my friend told me that shugo chara is nice and ask me to give it a try. i trusted her as she know more about anime stuffs than me, i was totally a noob. the plot found on internet is very simplified. so i

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8381">
        guess it won&#039;t interest you if you only base on the given storyline. the anime is so much better than i thought. <br />
<br />
the first episode makes me wanna go on to the next and suprisingly i finished 49 episodes in 3 days. i am currently waiting for episode 50 to be subbed. <br />
<br />
the storyline is quite unique, it says that every kid has their would-be self and one day they will become their would-be self. amu, (the main character of the anime) who appear to be cool with attitude to the others. but actually she is just an ordinary girl who is shy inside. she has 3 eggs heart, spade, clover who turns into her shugo charas which are good in sport, art and cooking respectively. she can do a character change to her would-be self and also tranformation which fight the x characters. her alliances are the so called guardians who act as the student council in school. they each have their own shugo chara too but they can&#039;t transform like what amu did. <br />
<br />
amu soon joined them but part of the reason is to get close to her ideal prince tadase. their main aim is to find an embryo which can grant any wishes. i really like the bond of their friendship and also the different characteristics of their shugo charas and it is really fun to see them having a character change. the one who look gentle and elegant actually turns out to be a fierce and harsh one and tadase character change is really hilarious.<br />
never mention the word prince in front of him cause the &#039;king&#039; will appear.<br />
<br />
another reason that i love this anime so much is because of another character which is ikuto. go to episode 3, you will fall in love with the scene where amu and ikuto has the eye contact at the kitchen. the way ikuto teases amu is really cute. this is why many of us gone crazy over amuto moments. another character utau who is a popular singer inside act another important role too. i think she is really pretty and her transformations are cool and awesome too. that is why i think the art of shugo chara worth a 9.<br />
<br />
all the characters have their unique point and the story developed very well. one of my favourite episode is 29 because so many unexpected things happened in one episode. <br />
<br />
IT IS A &#039;COOL AND SPICY&#039; ANIME ! recommend for shoujo lover. i don&#039;t think it suit guys but it depends actually. i can&#039;t say that every girls will like this or no guys will get addicted to it. you shall give it a try yourself.<br />
<br />
my first review , sorry if there are any grammer error .

    Giving Shugo Chara! a try is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of shoujo or mahou shoujo: because basically, it has all the ingrediants for one. Costumes that cannot possibly be practical but are cute, enemies that are defeated by the power of good, bright colours, younger aged characters and so on. But it doesn&#039;t only have that. It has a lot more alongside it. Much more - stuff that other mahou shoujo doesn&#039;t tend to have.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s geared for younger viewers esentially, but Shugo Chara! is one of those animes that has many levels. It&#039;&#039;s underneath its typical deminour that it shines.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10819">
        It&#039;s in those many levels that it has the ability to span to so many different people in so many different ways.<br />
<br />
STORY: As I&#039;ve said before, it&#039;s typically beat the bad guys by cleansing the eggs, lots of sparkles and shiny moments and some romance here and there. There&#039;s also a lot of laughs and unsuspecting moments along the way, which makes watching SC! all the more worthwhile. But it has a very essential message behind it, a message that everyone can connect with. How many times have you pretended to be different to fit in? How many times have you wished you could be more like your true self in front of everyone? That&#039;s what Shugo Chara seems to ask and addresses. The focus is on the characters and the routes they take to become their true selves; it&#039;s not all about defeating good and evil.<br />
<br />
ART: To be blunt, it&#039;s adorable. It&#039;s quite bright to appeal to younger viewers, but it isn&#039;t blinding. The colours all work together to create a believable world. It&#039;s very rare for any of it to be cheaply done - it&#039;s usually very good quality animation and artwork. Overall, it really adds to the atmosphere Shugo Chara brings - and even if the story and everything else is wonderful, if the art is bad, it isn&#039;t likely you&#039;re going to be able to watch it week in week out.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Typically simple, nice sounds throughout the episodes with recurring ones for the themes of characters and the cleansing of X-Eggs, with slight changes for each transformation. But I like the sound - it adds to the atmosphere. The opening and endings also deserve a mention here - Buono! was a wonderful creation for SC!, and even if I don&#039;t have the time or should be doing something else, I always watch through the opening and endings because I like the music. It&#039;s very cutesy, which isn&#039;t typically what I&#039;m into, but I like it. It&#039;s different.<br />
<br />
Lastly for sound, the voices are all a wonderful pick. I&#039;d say a shout out for Kanae Ito (Amu) is in order here - it&#039;s her first role, but she does it all perfectly. She isn&#039;t overbearing or annoying or frustrating - but she&#039;s believable.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: This is another area where SC! shines. The characters are not so-mind-blowingly-over-powered that they&#039;re unbelievable. Each one has their own flaws, their own doubts and personal problems. Each character is loveable on varying degrees, and that&#039;s because they&#039;re so believable. For several characters, too, I didn&#039;t like them for the first few episodes they were in. But as I grew to understand them and learn why they act like they do, what they&#039;re hiding behind the mask they give to the outside world, you start to fall in love with them. Because you can relate. <br />
<br />
Amu is also a refreshing heroine for shoujo. She completely contradicts the trend of cute characters that need protecting by everyone around her - she can be cute, but not overbearingly so. Her complete attitude is a draw in which is why peope like her, even though she fines it fake. Overall, the characters will grow on you in their own way over time.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: It&#039;s funny, it has romance, it&#039;s not too hard to understand and isn&#039;t at all confusing. It&#039;s simple in some respects but very effective. And it&#039;s easy to connect to, so very much easy to enjoy.

    I&#039;ve re-watched this anime 3 times and I keep on coming back. Its my all-time favourite anime and I never get tired of it and have zero complaints. I&#039;ve been re-watching animes lately and it&#039;s been 5 years since I first watched. I have changed my mind about a lot of animes, but this one still gets me giddy and excited. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty typical, one main girl character, two guys and a guardian angel. But there&#039;s something so fundamentally true about this story. Everyone hides their true self more than most would like to admit, it&#039;s about being true to yourself. <br />

    I know this is a somewhat old show (it&#039;s been, what, 13 years?), but still one of my favorites. I did watch this when I was younger, but not really understanding themes and concepts in the show (even though this is a show targeted towards kids). However, I recently went back to rewatch this show and I can&#039;t explain how much I missed it. It is truly the epitome of my childhood.<br />
<br />
I love the plot- it&#039;s genius. I don&#039;t know what the producers were thinking when they made this show, but they definitely created a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
The characters... don&#039;t even get me started. The character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342633">
        development is great! You can tell how much the characters and their personalities were thought about when creating the show. It really makes for quite an interesting anime. <br />
<br />
All in all, this is one of my favorite magical-girl shows up to date. It&#039;s been a while, but I&#039;m glad I finally rewatched it again.<br />
<br />
Now, if you still don&#039;t understand how much I love this show, I based my whole MAL profile around it. My username, my profile pic, you get the point. If you&#039;re wishy-washy about watching this show, just go for it! It won&#039;t hurt watching an episode, and chances are, you&#039;ll actually enjoy it! YOLO!! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I&#039;ve recently started a new blog series called &quot;Break it Down!&quot; which breaks down the series and all of the nitty-gritty questionable, unrealistic stuff! My first blog post was on Shugo Chara!, so please go check that out!

    Story: 10/10. Mostly because of the message behind the whole 51 episodes. At first glance, this anime might look like the usual school life, shoujo anime. If you think about it, there&#039;s actually a strong message behind the whole thing. It&#039;s just outstanding how such a simple message developing into a whole 51 episode anime... and a couple more seasons after that. (Still didn&#039;t get the message? HINT: think about how the eggs represents your dreams) I also really like the original storyline about guardian characters, x-eggs etc. Not to forget about the comedy. I also like how the anime doesn&#039;t just focus on one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99665">
        character&#039;s problems.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10 I personally really like the art. It&#039;s detailed and the clothing/hair styles of the characters are unique. <br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10 I really like the opening and the endings. I&#039;m also a fan of Utau&#039;s songs (well, maybe not a mega fan but...). I personally think that the voice actors have also done a great job overall. <br />
<br />
Character: 7/10 In some way, the characters are stereotypical and not properly developed. Like how the guardians were popular, how Ikuto appears to be the stereotypical tsundere etc. On the other hand, it wasn&#039;t too obvious as the storyline and surroundings &#039;blends it in&#039; (if I&#039;ve made any sense at all x__x) Also, no Mary Sues/Gary Stus. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 Personally, this is the anime I&#039;ve enjoyed most so far. It&#039;s quite surprising because this isn&#039;t the genre I usually like watching. I suggest you could try watching it even if it&#039;s not really your type of anime. It&#039;s also a sweet, funny and a somehow relate-able anime, especially the message behind the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10 It&#039;s alright if you disagree with me. You might not like it as much as I do. I have nothing against that. One final word to sum up: A W E S O M E!!!

    If you like the type of anime that involves heros/heroines, romance and comedy, I highly suggest you watch shugo chara. <br />
When I first decided to watch it, I thought it&#039;d be childish and dumb, but when the main character started talking about how she really felt, I could relate. She didn&#039;t really know anything about herself and she felt like she made the wrong impression. As I continued watching, I saw how everything just came together perfectly. There&#039;s reason&#039;s behind everyone&#039;s dream, they didn&#039;t just say &quot;Ok! This character wants to be a ___ when they grow up,&quot; for no reason. You really got to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178451">
        connect with each of them to the point where you want their wildest dreams to come true(after you&#039;ve watched it, it&#039;s pretty obvious who I&#039;m talking about...).<br />
<br />
 It really tells anyone who watches it, &quot;Hey, dreams are very easily broken, but you should chase them.&quot; <br />
Although the anime could never happen, it seems to show reality more than fantasy. You are going to have fights with your friends, you are going to get hurt and you might even cry, but you shouldn&#039;t just give up everything just because one little thing. If you fall, let your friends pick you up and don&#039;t care about what others think of you. Others might stab you in the back, but you do the same afterwords, it will be an unending war. <br />
<br />
Shugo Chara has many plot twists that you couldn&#039;t really see coming. I would give you an example, but that&#039;d ruin it for you if you choose to watch it(I saw a picture that gave one away. It sucked).

    Shugo Chara!!!! I&#039;m just going to come right out and say it: It&#039;s AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn&#039;t like all the others! <br />
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &amp;quot;Cool &amp;amp; spicy&amp;quot; [if that doesn&#039;t already make you laugh, I don&#039;t know what will] by her classmates. She doesn&#039;t have any friends because she gives off this cool, &amp;quot;do whatever you want&amp;quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn&#039;t like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &amp;quot;would be self&amp;quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6302">
        her bed.<br />
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &amp;quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&amp;quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute! <br />
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What&#039;s so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you&#039;ll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T). <br />
<br />
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; (like Sailor Moon&#039;s mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don&#039;t like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you&#039;ll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time!<br />
<br />
Story--like I said, it&#039;s a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That&#039;s why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you&#039;re used to!<br />
<br />
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu&#039;s pink hair. :p<br />
<br />
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice.<br />
<br />
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn&#039;t know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I&#039;m-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn&#039;t act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it&#039;s a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime.<br />
<br />
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

    (My First Review)<br />
<br />
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”.<br />
<br />
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character.<br />
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36220">
        and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian.<br />
<br />
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream.<br />
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes. <br />
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time.<br />
<br />
Art: 7.5/10<br />
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7.5/10<br />
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8.5/10<br />
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.5/10<br />
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.<br />

    Of all the numerous Mahou Shoujo/Magical Girls anime series, Shugo Chara! is one of the best. The majority of animes in this genre tend to be along the same plotline: a ditzy heroine gets magical powers and is given the responsibility to save the world somehow; we all know the story. Shugo Chara!, however, is a breath of fresh air amidst this crazy monotony. First off, Amu, our main character, isn&#039;t the stereotypical ditzy heroine (gasp!). Instead, she the &quot;cool and spicy&quot; new student. Second, Amu and Co. aren&#039;t just saving the world. Instead, this anime focuses on dreams, goals, wishes, and your &quot;would-be self&quot;.

        How many times can we honestly say we&#039;ve seen that in a Mahou Shoujo anime? It may not be a story comparable to, say,the infamous Cardcaptor Sakura, but it ranks fairly high up there. And as a bonus, it&#039;s comparitavely free of filler. (That&#039;s just RELATIVELY, though.)<br />
<br />
The animation is great, the art is colorful, and some of the objects (e.g., Heart&#039;s Eggs, X Eggs, Humpty Lock, etc.) look almost computer-animeated. The art style is the standard big-eyed Shoujo style, which complements the anime&#039;s story and charcters pretty well.<br />
<br />
The music, too, is also great. The two openings are a lot less cutesy than the ones in the Doki!! series, which I&#039;m sure most of us older fans appreciate. Even some of the background music, specifically the action scene music, is catchy enough to make you want to download it. No, seriously. Not to mention Utau&#039;s songs.<br />
<br />
The characters are unique. Some may get annoying at times, but every series has its share of obnoxious characters. Each character has their quirks, hidden traits, likes and dislikes. Some characters do seem to be slightly stereotypical (e.g., Ran, Suu, etc.), though.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a series to watch, Shugo Chara! is a good pick. The filler may become a nuisance in the Doki! season, but don&#039;t let that deter you from the first.

    Honestly, I had never heard of Shugo Chara! before I saw a fairly bad fan dub audition for it. At the time, I was low on good animes and was just searching for one to watch. I really didn&#039;t care if it was bad or amazing. I thought the animation looked cute so I promptly typed in &quot;Shugo Chara! 1&quot; into the search bar and started watching. In that one day, I watched 12 episodes in a row. Call me a hermit if you want, but it&#039;s just that addicting. As of now I have finished the first series (Seasons 1 &amp; 2) and have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14282">
        moved on to Shugo Chara! Doki!, the second series.<br />
<br />
I have always enjoyed shojo anime but this one stands. Throughout my entire life, I&#039;ve found strength in being myself, but I often struggle trying to figure out who exactly that is. I didn&#039;t know what I was going to do with my life. This anime taught me my what I was searching for the entire time. My dream became to protect other&#039;s dreams. I want people to be happy, while being themselves and doing what they love. This anime encourages just that and using some of the cutest transformations I&#039;ve ever seen. With each character having their own story and personality, there is, not doubt, someone you can relate to. Every person can benfit from this anime, whether you need just a good laugh or a life lesson.<br />
<br />
Of course, this anime isn&#039;t just about finding yourself. There are countless love rivals for the main character, Hinamori Amu. The romance in this anime is captivating and colorful. You can&#039;t seem to chose which couple you want to support. <br />
<br />
Watching this anime will make you want to create a chara of your own. You might even think you&#039;re going insane, but that&#039;s just how much you will love it.<br />
<br />
Who knew that on that very broing summer day earlier this year I would find an anime that would awaken my passion again? To every girl from 5 to 25, I highly suugest that you watch this anime.
