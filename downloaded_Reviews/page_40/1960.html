    Cross Ange is a travesty. It&#039;s a horrible, stupid, illogical trainwreck of a show with shoddy production values that relies almost entirely on pandering to the lowest forms of human life and waving shallow moments of shock value all over the screen. The series has a narcissistic sense of self-awareness, and in each episode you can nearly hear a subtle narration by the director and other Sunrise execs laughing at how much of a moron you are for watching this garbage that they&#039;ve put in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I bet those glass-eyed imbeciles are getting bored, let&#039;s put in another lesbian threesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not yet. Only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184182">
        after we show the loli whipping someone again.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, it&#039;s one of the best things I&#039;ve seen out of this studio in years. With a big &quot;Fuck you, Sunrise.&quot;, let&#039;s go into this.<br />
<br />
Cross Ange is a lot of different things. Cross Ange is a magical princess show about knights and dragons. Cross Ange is a prison drama. Cross Ange is Mean Girls. Cross Ange is borderline yuri hentai. Cross Ange is Gundam Seed. Cross Ange is a catharsis for the type of person who has a Fetlife account. Cross Ange is what would happen if you made a Princess Peach anime starring Ronda Rousey. Cross Ange is proof that not only will Mizuki Nana play any role, but that she is also good at it. Cross Ange is anime madlibs where your only word choices are &quot;lesbians&quot;, &quot;dragons&quot; and &quot;kill&quot;.<br />
<br />
The actual premise of the story is that a pampered princess named Angelise, a thoroughly awful person, is thrown out of her castle and put in an all-ladies jail when it&#039;s found out that she&#039;s a fraud. She&#039;s then forced to pilot a Gundam and fight dragons, because. And then she&#039;s bullied, molested or beaten up a lot, until she finally becomes &quot;Ange&quot;, the greatest main character to ever appear in a Sunrise mecha show. Then the story becomes about rebellion, alternate timelines and dimensions, fighting god, virtual realities, and uhhhhh... Yeah. The story progresses through a flurry of ridiculous plot twists, comically evil villainous acts, and lesbian sex scenes. It&#039;s certainly not boring, but you will hate yourself for watching it. One of my favorite things about this series is what they do with the episode previews, where the characters break the 4th wall and banter about how ridiculous all this shit is.<br />
<br />
My other favorite thing is that there are dragons in this show. But they&#039;re not dragons, they&#039;re DRAGONs, and they&#039;re called that because they&#039;re DRAGONs and not because they&#039;re dragons.<br />
<br />
But really, the legitimate thing you&#039;re watching this for is Ange. Ange is amazing. She&#039;s logical, pessimistic, she cheats, she&#039;ll insult you and everything you stand for, disarm you and then shoot you through the face, twice. She&#039;s so out of the norm for an anime protagonist I can barely deal. She doesn&#039;t want harmony, she wants destruction. She wants to demolish everything that&#039;s wronged her. She&#039;s not a victim. The show is called &quot;Cross Ange&quot; because she&#039;s cross about 90% of the time. She is the one who knocks.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. Cross Ange does a competent job at giving you multifaceted, developing characters to feel things about, even if those feelings are mostly hatred and/or pity. The other central females are almost all emotionally damaged in some way or another, and are in contrast to Ange, very fragile people. I thought this was very interesting, because not only is Ange a strong, domineering, unbreakable character on her own, but those qualities shine even more when you slowly see the deep-seated problems with everyone around her. <br />
<br />
This series only has like two male characters. One of them is Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed, except that he&#039;s completely useless and a stooge 90% of the time. If you&#039;re ever worried about Ange being overshadowed or saved by her boyfriend, don&#039;t worry, he&#039;s the bottom in the relationship. This was also refreshing. Except for near the end where he actually starts doing things, that was lame and subverted a lot of the good things about his character and the show as a whole.<br />
<br />
The other major male character is the central villain, Fetus-kun,  who is also the most self-aware jab at otaku I&#039;ve ever seen. The whole premise of his character is that he&#039;s his own OC, and is looking for the perfect waifu. It&#039;s insulting and hilarious at the same time, just like the rest of the series.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, Ange looks pretty okay at its best, and pretty bad at its worst. Gundam Unicorn this is not. The character and mech designs are also pretty bland, making the series not seem like anything relevant when looked at out-of-context.<br />
<br />
The audio&#039;s good. Nothing to write home about. You get a bunch of Mizuki Nana and stuff. I can&#039;t recall much of the BGM at all even though I watch this series week by week. The recurring insert song sung by Ange is pretty memorable.<br />
<br />
Cross Ange is a big damn spectacle with one of the best female leads in any anime. It&#039;s ridiculous and stupid, and even Sunrise probably hates you for watching it, so that means you should.

    The last episode came, many people watched it and at the end one thought was strongly resonating in their brain: &quot;Why did we underestimate this anime so much?&quot;.  The beginning of this anime may be the biggest hoax in the anime history. Not only it made no sense, but it was like in the middle of night while you were sleeping someone blew up your roof, killed your family and then told you that it was your fault and you should be punished. No sense right? Still, slowly but surely this anime showed that it was a lot more than that. Sometimes  surprising

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184094">
        by the deep philosophical understanding of the human nature, and sometimes using its main card, the fighting, the best way possible. Many could say the entire premise of this anime was to not judge a book by its cover. No mater how ugly it may be, what is inside could be worth thousands of time more than a book with a cover that shines like gold. Anyway, lets do it the normal way: <br />
Story - 9, The story of this anime centers around a girl, Ange a royal princess, who at her coming of age ceremony is shown to be a Norma, a person not considered human in a society where everyone is using mana to control everything around them, thus making life easier. Everything falls into chaos, many sad things happen around her and after that she is sent to Arsenal, no, not the team, but a place where all Norma are disposed of, or so was believed. A lot of whining, hundreds of screams, enough to make you wish she was killed right on the spot. After a few episodes no one would wish the same thing. Not only because her character became a lot more interesting, but because the purpose of Arsenal is becoming clearer.The story becomes more and more complex as time passes so it should be impossible for someone to try to present the story in only a few words. There are betrayals, there is love, there is friendship, sadness,quite a lot of yuri, and we have an awesome antagonist who appears at the right moment. Still, its not like everything was perfect. There are a few blanks in the story, blanks that not only were not explained but it felt like a railway was missing some parts. For better or worse, we were made to forget about this and move on. I don&#039;t know if that part is to be explained in a movie, ova or maybe a second season, but it certainly needs one to explain a few missing parts without going back to the plot of the first season. Its the best ending for this anime and I really do not wish for everything to repeat in the same world as before.<br />
Now, after the story comes the art.<br />
 Art - 9, Sometimes I wonder, how should we describe art? Some anime have such an ugly art that it would not be a surprise of everyone to hate that anime, but instead there are fans saying it receives a ten just because they feel like it fits. Sadly, I do not have the same opinion. Art is about beauty, about fluidity, about complexity, about impact. This anime excels at most, but some may say they could be even better just because .. . Anyway, every characters, robot, dragon looked awesome. Especially the dragons which didn&#039;t try to fit in the same criteria we were used to. Each battle was like a movie. They can make you forget to blink or breath. The only problem was its too fast pace. They moved to fast from one place to another and because of this it became tiresome to try to take in everything and instead were are left with the decision to only concentrate only on a few things forgetting about the rest. <br />
Sound - 10, extremely enjoyable. The bgm is very important, but its true role  is to make you feel attracted to the story, which this one did. If a bgm attracts to much attention, be it good or bad, then it failed in its purpose. Some forget about this and rate it poorly or better only based on this. The ost, op, ed and especially the seyuu&#039;s are the most important. And all of them are doing their job perfectly.<br />
Characters - 10, Vivid, strong, beautifully. Each and everyone of them had what you could call charm. Their personalities, feelings, point of view were attractive mostly because there are so many that its impossible to not see at least one that shared your emotions and state of mind. I can say that in my opinion this anime strongest point were the characters.<br />
Enjoyment - 9, there is not much to say about this. It was a gem found in the garbage. If you can watch it with an open mind you will not only not regret doing it but you are also going to remember it as one of the most surprising anime in the entire history.<br />
Overall - 9, The story was not perfect, this is clear. A story that is short but also complex can hardly manage what Cross Ange did. Its divergent points were not only large in numbers, but also had its own characters which had to do their job in a way that wouldn&#039;t hinder the progress of the story. I&#039;m going to re-watch it later this year for sure. Until then I can only recommend it to anyone who loves anime.

    This is possibly one of the most underrated animes from the fall season. <br />
<br />
You can read my overall + my final thoughts/notes at the very bottom of the review if you&#039;re feeling lazy and just want some quick feedback on the anime.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t lie the first 5 episodes was extremely hard to get through for many which lead to the anime being dropped early on, and also given a poor rating due to its evaluation being solely based off of these first 5 episodes. It is now one of the animes I look forward to watching every week, almost as much as &quot;Your Lie in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184186">
        April&quot;. <br />
<br />
Anyways, on with the review!<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
<br />
The setting of the anime is that of a dystopia, it follows a Princess (Ange) who is stripped of all her rights after being revealed that she is a norma (which are like unwanted humans due to their inability to use &quot;mana&quot;). This is one of the weaker points of the anime, although the story isn&#039;t bad, it wasn&#039;t done correctly for to be anything too special. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the story isn&#039;t boring in anyway and is fairly interesting, just not above and beyond (hence the 7). <br />
A plus for the anime would be the unexpected twist and turns they have which sometimes really caught me by surprise, they often leave you wondering what may happen in the future. Overall its a decent story, but nothing too amazing.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
<br />
Honestly the art is pretty good the characters, background, &quot;ragna-mail&quot;, and pretty much everything looks like it was done quite well. The animation is quite fluid and well done, and I honestly have nothing to complain about in this section. The art isn&#039;t exceptionally beautiful but it&#039;s pretty good, although you can notice the budget slipping in some scenes, but overall the art for all the characters + most of the animation is very crisp.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
One of the reasons why you SHOULD watch this anime. The sound track that they have is amazing in my opinion, both their OST and their opening/ending songs. Their use of music is on point for most of the anime, although there were a couple of times I felt that the music could have been used more effectively. I read one of the other reviews saying how the anime&#039;s OST + openings/endings were bad, please don&#039;t listen to them and give it a chance BECAUSE THE OST IS AMAZING!<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
Yeah so Ange is possibly one of the most BAD ASS female leads I&#039;ve seen in a while. She is extremely strong willed and self-righteous and that is the part I love about her. I REALLY like characters that can look strong enough to take on the entire world yet can look really weak and docile the next. The character developments and the revealing of a characters true nature/past is really well done in the anime, although some of the characters story could have had some improvements (cough Embryo).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime, some parts could of had some minor tweeks, but it was a great anime to watch. To those who are able to watch all 25 episodes of this anime at once, I&#039;m really jealous because you won&#039;t feel the pain I had to wait for this every week. :&#039;(<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll repeat this again, I love a strong female lead that can take on the entire world, but in the next second can be really docile, weak and in need of protection and support. Cross Ange is a mecha anime that is really well made, if you look over a few of the poor things that they have done. I promise all you mecha fans that you will thoroughly enjoy the animes OST, great animation, interesting characters and their unique background story (PREPARE A TISSUE BOX WHEN THEY&#039;RE REVEALING SOME OF THE CHARACTERS BACKGROUND). They do quite a few plot twist and a bit of romance in the anime, however little that romance may be. But with respect to the lifestyle transition Ange has been forced to live in, the romance does feels really &#039;cute&#039;.<br />
<br />
NOTE/FINAL THOUGHTS: <br />
<br />
-Please understand that this anime DOES contain mature content.<br />
<br />
-This anime is definitely one you should give a chance to (please at least give it until episode 6).<br />
<br />
-Review may be slightly biased due to my love for mecha animes.<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
<br />
+Has an amazing OST. Really love their opening and endings + their music choice.<br />
<br />
+Ange is possibly one of the best female leads I&#039;ve seen in a while.<br />
<br />
+Highly recommended for those who enjoy the following genres: Dystopia ,Ecchi, Mecha <br />
<br />
+The anime has enough plot twist to constantly surprise you &amp; keep you interested.<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
<br />
-Personally I really dislike it when something isn&#039;t suppose to happens, not going to say who but when someone is suppose to die, they really should die.<br />
<br />
-You may sometimes notice in the animation where the anime was being &quot;efficient&quot; with their budget.<br />
<br />
-Although their OST is really good, their timing for their background music could use a little work.<br />
<br />
-The pacing of the anime is quite good for most of the anime, but some parts could have been slowed down.

    To be honest, this was one of the anime I&#039;ve been looking forward to during the fall season. It looks and sounds interesting but its overall presentation is just so bad.<br />
As I watched this I realized I saw a lot of plot holes by watching it once. Usually I would watch an anime three times to notice anything but every problem is just so provoking that it&#039;s noticeable.<br />
I won&#039;t be talking about rape, fanservice, or morality problems as other reviews I&#039;ve seen have, unless they&#039;re problematic in some other way. They&#039;re problems in their own right but I&#039;m not one to judge an anime based

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178565">
        off that.<br />
<br />
Story: 2/10<br />
On paper, the plot sounds very interesting, enough to drag me in. But the execution is god awful. The problem with Cross Ange is that it tries way too hard and ends up being edgy as hell. There&#039;s no coherency because anything it offers is so poorly implicated. The first few episodes were somewhat acceptable but it turns to a lot of illogical dialogue. A few episodes later it plays on a lot high school anime tropes and comedic plays that don&#039;t fit the anime&#039;s theme. Overall it just doesn&#039;t set the tone or setting that it should have. But I&#039;ve stratched a long and tried to watch it. By the eleventh episodes, I dropped this because of how horribly written it is. At that point it just felt like the creator realized how bad his work and was about to be fired from his job if he didn&#039;t do anything good, but he resulted in a cheap product with no good foundation. It has a lot of very interesting concepts but the way it&#039;s presented is just so bad.<br />
Now I know I said I wouldn&#039;t talk about the fanservice but this is something important. I would be fine if it were used for rape and a prison like environment, but it&#039;s used for comedy. It conflicts with the tone and is more annoying than fanservice should be. Only a few anime/manga have been able to be funny and keep a serious story, I.E. Fullmetal Alchemist, but this isn&#039;t one of them.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
I am more critical of art and animation for various reasons, but let&#039;s not get into that. The animation is bad to the point where I actually notice the frames. The CG is very straightforward, it&#039;s either bad or not. This is bad. It&#039;s very out of place and obviously you can notice it. The CG ddoesn&#039;t mesh in too well with the background but that&#039;s ridiculous because the background when using CG is usually the blue sky.<br />
The artwork is meh-ish. The designs and concepts arejust so bland and generic. &quot;Yes let&#039;s have a blonde princess like every anime. Whatelse sshould we have?&quot; &quot;Oh, I have all these generically designed characters with me.&quot; Was pretty much what I thought the creator was thinking. The mech designs are pretty stupid. What&#039;s with that royal royce on Ange&#039;s mech. They try to look cool rather than practical which is something I prefer in mech designs.<br />
<br />
Sound: 2/10<br />
I overall hate it. Nothing stood out and I found nothing powerful enough because of how conflictingly unnoticeable it is. That&#039;s a fault on Cross Ange itself because of how it can&#039;t keep a good atmosphere.<br />
The voice acting was average to below. The majority of voices sound so artificial that I can&#039;t help but be annoyed. Their voices sound like they&#039;re being faked. Like a character faking their voice in a cheesy television show I watched as a kid.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
Throughout, I have never hated characters so passionately. The characters I do like don&#039;t even get screen time. I can&#039;t believe how artificial the character development is. The reason is because of the plot contrivances and the lack of solid characterization so that we&#039;re given good ideology in the earlier episodes. Any event that provokes development is done so terribly, because there&#039;s no foreshadowing nor a natural flow. Everything is planned out like &quot;IT SHOULD HAPPEN&quot; rather than &quot;IT WILL HAPPEN.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
Generally, I couldn&#039;t come to love this because of how boring it is. I would usually watch something for gore regardless of how badly written it is but the gore just feels cheap and needless, because the presentation is just chauvinistically pretentious and overdramatic, and how the atmosphere is wrongly set through every little moment.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
At best I think this would be a six but I won&#039;t be here to see it get any bette or worse.

    I can say with great confidence that Cross Ange is one of the trashiest, garbage series I have watched in quite a while. Its ridiculous amounts of over the top fan service and emphasis on shock and awe scenes are legitimate lunacy. However, after the travesty that is the first few episodes a compelling story begins to rise from the muck that is Cross Ange and give people a legitmate reason to keep watching besides the fanservice and some some good mecha action. <br />
<br />
The story begins by introducing us to our main heroine Ange, who lives in a world where magic is a used daily,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185609">
        and those without magic are a persecuted group of people called the Norma. Ange is pretty unlikable for the first few episodes,  as she clings to the fact that Normas are inferior, despite the fact that she is revealed to be a Norma herself, apparently not realizing that not using Mana once in your life is a tell tale symptom. From there she is shipped off to a Norma prison island and told that she has to fight DRAGONs to save humanity, why in all caps? Apparently Sunrise thought it looked cool. From there Ange is introduced to the other Norma, who are all young girls, and the fanservice begins, and it&#039;s literary ridiculous. There&#039;s some weird rapey scenes, lesbian three ways to keep the plot moving, and Ange is naked  for about 60 percent of her on screen time, a trend continues as the series moves on. The first few episodes will test if you are ready for this series, from going for over the top shock affect on issues such as racism, lots of nudity, and little girls getting lopped in half by giant dragons. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, and it sometimes hilarious to watch the over the top nature, and the series seems pretty self aware of just how trashy and bad it is. The cast of side characters initially aren&#039;t very important to the plot or are given much attention, besides the leader Salia and the head lesbian Hilda. There is also a guy named Tusk who lives on an island and rescues Ange at some point, and all of their conversations consist of him accidentally bury his head in her crotch or something like that, than Ange shouts &quot;baka&quot; and beats the crap out of him. That is basically a summary of that episode. However Tusk shows some interesting characteristics as well as brings up some mysteries about the world of Mana.<br />
<br />
 The story starts to pick up near the end of the first half, when the narritive shifts from the island back to the mainland, where we are given a lot more depth into Hilda&#039;s character that makes her much more likable and understandable, and we once again see how ingrained the fear of the norma is in the people who use Mana. However a large battle breaks out on the Norma battle island, and during this battle we are introduced to the main villain Embryo, whose main attack as well as the other special mechas is powered by song. I wish I was making some of this up, but it seems like Sunrise started throwing crap at a wall until it stuck. The story starts to get more and more interesting after this point, and has some twists and shows us how exactly the earth has ended up in this state and the true nature of the DRAGONs, and some honestly genuine twist regarding the cast of characters and how they have been manipulated by the great Embryo, and seeing how he played off the weaknesses of each girl makes him a cool character to watch. They start throwing a lot of science jargon around during the end that feels like it could be replaced with a recording of Jesse Pinkman saying, &quot;science bitch&quot; over and over as it seems like they are just sputtering straight nonsense. Also there is a ridiculous deus ex machina  near the end that left in tears as it tried to explain how a frying pain stopped a bullet and can also apparently save you from falling into a ravine and getting hit by an exploding car, its like they suddenly realized these characters are integral to the plot and has never heard of the no take back rule. But in all honesty, the second half is  a vast improvement and has an interesting plot that can suck you in.<br />
<br />
The characters are very diverse, with most falling in the categories of being Ange, wanting to bone Ange, or strongly disliking Ange because they want to be her. Ange falls in the being Ange category, and starts off pretty dislikable, but quickly turns into the chosen one who pilots the special mech with great skill and cares deeply for her comrades and friends. Tusk falls into the wanting to bone her category, and is a skilled fighter and nice guy who helps out the Norma and is considered to be Ange&#039;s knight, which as a side effect grants invulnerability. Salia is the leader and falls into the hate us because they ain&#039;t us category, and is initially a fairly competent leader who keeps a steady head, but is insecure due to the fact that she was not chosen and Ange was. Hilda wants to bone Ange and starts off unlikable, but as she learn more about her and she softens up she is a fairly likable character who goes through some nice development. Embryo wasnt to bone Ange, is the ridiculous Op bad guy with a justified God Complex, and is actually interesting to watch how he toys with others and manipulates them to accomplish his will. i was also impressed with the later development of some of the other side characters, as it really shows what&#039;s going through their heads and proves they are more than just boobs and ass.<br />
<br />
Overall Cross Ange is a train wreck, but is one that you can;t turn away from. It&#039;s over the top scenes can make it hilarious, and it seems aware of this fact which is honestly pretty funny. the fan service is up to ridiculous levels, and I would advise if you choose to watch this series do it in a sealed room because if someone walks in on you during some of the more fanservicey scenes you are going to have some explaining to do. The plot really gets going as the show completes it&#039;s run, but you have to put up with the trash that is the first few episodes and be able to take a ready helping of fan service. Cross Ange is definitely an experience, and one i would recommend giving a try, even if you can hear cackling Sunrise execs counting their money as you watch the literal crap they put out that somehow turned out to be pretty good. Nest year we&#039;ll probably have a mecha series featuring fully naked girls fighting GRIFFINs in space while trying to bring down two gods in a separate dimension, with a healthy dose of lesbian three ways, but that goes without saying.

    &quot;Are you a fan of anime?<br />
A fan of well-written and intricate plots which leave you completely speechless?<br />
How about stories which are completely dark and riveting, while completely obscuring the moral boundaries which define human society?<br />
Are you searching for a gem that will change how you view the world and force you to question the value a human life has?<br />
Then look no further - as the masterpiece entitled &#039;Cross Ange&#039; is the story you&#039;ve been looking for!&quot; - said no one ever (at least at the time of writing).<br />
<br />
Then do you like Sunrise? (taken both ways, since you&#039;ll be seeing a lot of both)<br />
If you answered

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184230">
        yes, then please read on for this review of a journey filled with much oppai, BDSM, mechas, and made-up words galore!<br />
<br />
Do note that I&#039;m an offensive person by nature, so I do apologise for anything further ahead<br />
<br />
If I had to describe &#039;Cross Ange&#039; in one single word; I&#039;d have to choose the phrase &#039;Identity Disorder&#039;. Tabling the fact that that&#039;s two words for now - I say this due to the fact that you&#039;re presented with an absolutely appalling princess of some generic utopia, who is an idol for the citizens and all their ilk. However, all is not well in genericutopialand as you might expect. This is due to the presence of third-class citizens who are termed as &#039;Norma&#039;.<br />
<br />
Now, these &#039;Norma&#039;, or as luck might have it, sounds similar to the word &#039;Normal&#039;; and are just normal people, in that they are essentially plebeians like us people here in the real world. Meaning, they can&#039;t use magic. They are the minority and are thus prosecuted for some sort of obscure reasons, and are the stigma of humankind&#039;s evolution (Not our humankind, but the &#039;Cross Ange&#039; mankind).<br />
<br />
As this anime was produced by Sunrise, you should expect the obvious trademarks and troupes generic to everything they produce; like strife between a bunch of factions because reasons deem them necessary. You&#039;ll also see island episodes, romance, beautiful filial bonds and the long-awaited revival of Kira &#039;Jesus&#039; Yamato. (Not that you can ever kill him)<br />
<br />
The main character whose name was something along the lines of &#039;MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi,&#039; is forced to join a ragtag group of girls and fight against dragon-esque creatures, which happen to be called DRAGONs because convoluted acronyms sound cool.<br />
I realize I&#039;ve digressed, but I&#039;ll get to my main point eventually.<br />
<br />
In terms of characters, there are a bunch of girls to choose from if you&#039;re looking to find a new waifu. For example, early on in the story, you see two girls who try to make friends with MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi, otherwise known as &#039;Ange&#039;. These two girls are waifu material in that, they make friends with Ange despite her contempt for them. Not only that, they are definitely crucial to the story since they have hair that is feasible for real-life people and don&#039;t appear in the opening at all. You&#039;ve even got your pick of the litter with girls like Ange&#039;s friend no. 1 to 50. Top class waifu material if I do say so myself.<br />
<br />
At any rate, just know that anybody who isn&#039;t a Norma is basically a bad person. As for the, rejects of society, they&#039;re all either full-blown lesbians or are bi-curious. If you&#039;re looking for a male relationship, then you&#039;re in awful luck, since there&#039;s only three male characters around. The most notable of which is pseudo-RitoKira. As you might expect of anyone who bears resemblance to either of them, he is capable of fixing strange machinery like Gunda- oops, I mean &#039;Para-Mail&#039;. He is not only capable of being beaten up, but is also capable of living despite having a magnet embedded to his face which attracts him to Ange&#039;s crotch.<br />
<br />
I have nothing much to say about Ange, other than the fact that she seems too good for the show. She&#039;s a very likable person for me, but she does seem to suffer from a chronic case of &#039;falls-in-love-with-king-of-NTR&#039;. At one point, I even worried that he&#039;d steal her position as main character. Luckily, he&#039;s as useless as any other harem protagonist. Not in an endearing way though.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been ranting too long, so I&#039;ll  be brief about my main complaint. The plot. The plot started off simple, and I even considered it pretty decent at one point in time, but it breaks records in my book as the biggest piece of &#039;what the hell is this? I dont even...&#039;. The plot jumps around so much that it seems to suffers from DID in trying to be so many things a la Samurai Flamenco. <br />
Not only that, I even question what the hell went through the staff of Sunrise&#039;s minds when they decided on the premise of Dragons from the Nth dimension fighting robots piloted by the girls of Freezing. Whoever they were, I commend them for absolutely ruining what little remains of my good faith in Sunrise. I&#039;m sure all two of them had fun self-inserting themselves in Tusk&#039;s place as he smothered himself in Ange&#039;s panties to death.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion; if I&#039;m asked (not that anybody would ask me) if this anime is worth watching.<br />
I&#039;d tell them &#039;sure, go ahead if you&#039;re a fan of kinky stuff&#039;<br />
If you ask whether it&#039;s dark.<br />
Sadly the only thing dark here in this anime are the minds of its director, the lighting and the girls panties (in that case, it&#039;s be white censorship).<br />
Fret not though, since Sunrise will always find a way to shine the morning light of their company on all that darkness through the entity of BD, and Ange&#039;s glare-inducing coloured hair.<br />
<br />
Good job Sunrise!<br />
Don&#039;t give up Sunrise!<br />
Goodwork Sunrise!<br />
Learn to CG Sunrise! (Computer Graphics, not Code Geass)<br />
Farewell Sunrise.<br />
May you never produce anything better than Code Geass.<br />
Curse you Sunrise!<br />
<br />
Note that I&#039;m making fun of them not out of spite, but because they&#039;re dear to me.<br />
It&#039;s also for the sake of their own betterment. See, I&#039;m not rude. I&#039;m just Tsundere!<br />
Aren&#039;t I just a great person? (I know I&#039;m not, but just let me revel in my fantasies)<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll rewrite or edit this review when I have the time.<br />
I have a lot more to say, but I&#039;ll do that another time if need be.<br />
Note that I haven&#039;t finished the series yet, so I may change my opinion.

    Disclaimer: This review is my own opinion, take it for what its worth. I will be breaking this down into the stages MAL uses for rankings as there is a lot to cover with this one. As normal I will do my best not to spoil and keep it to the broad strokes. In addition I will worn you now. Watching this with friends is a no no. YES it is a bit risque, YES there are some very confronting things about this show, but that is not what I am talking about. There are a lot of girls in this one, to the point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review192483">
        wear there are like 4 male characters. And this mas of girls is hot and I mean HOT. I am telling you this now because I will not be held responsible for starting waifu war 4. Why 4? Simple! Because we all know waifu war 3 started when HuniePop was released, get with the times people. Que theme music aaaaaand GO!<br />
<br />
Cross Ange: Tenshi to so on and so forth is an action, sci-fie, ecchi... ish anime that dose a splendid job of just about everything. It was a masterfully crafted peace from start to finish with only a small handful of what one might call &quot;glaring&quot; flows to it, but I don&#039;t want to scare you off it so I will leave them until later, like right at the end. For now, I must gush like the fan boy I am.<br />
<br />
This was without question one of the best things I have watched in at least a year. I was  in love with this anime right from the first episode. It was fast paces but was not afraid to slow down the tiniest amount when it wanted you to feel things. It plays with the full gambit of emotions. Love, hate, sorrow and a hole bunch of others I cant seem to name coz well... I&#039;m a guy, but trust me they are there and in spades. Not going to lie, there was a point in time this show jerked a tear out of my eye. Other times I was literally laughing out loud, right before being angry for the same reason. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, not a crazy one but from episode to episode it definitely gets you. Some of the time the feelings are not the sort you should have for animated girls but hey, that&#039;s never stopped us before am I right internet? The big kicker to it all though is that its all about the basics of human nature. The need to be in control or how we don&#039;t relay function alone. The fact that they tell the story with fuck off robots is just gravy. Ok that may have been a bit of spoils but if you haven&#039;t gotten that from the first two eps your likely watching this anime for the wrong reasons. 10 for 10 on enjoyment. Moving on...<br />
<br />
This first thing that hit me about this anime was the outstanding use of colour. I am a devout follower of the high and mighty &quot;Lord Vivid Colours&quot; and I can say without a doubt this anime would pleas him. The pallet was vast, all the colours and not just a splash on a brown back drop modern day FSP style. What starts as a peaceful setting drenched in bright pinks, yellows, blues and whites gos down a darker path as the mood of the show changes. The are quickly replaced by blacks, grays and reds but stay with me I am not taking back what I said earlier. It takes an episode or two but the colours return in full force as the disposition of the characters improve and the reality of the world sets in. When the mood is good the colours are bright. When it is bad the pallet changes to reflect it. It is as much a part of the story as anything else and it helps immensely with the fast pacing of the show that there are visual ques like this to help keep the viewer on track. On a less ranty note the art over all was very well done with a lot of sharp lines and easily identifiable shapes, nothing just blended into the back ground. Each peace of furniture and the people on screen were easily recognizable but it very rarely felt cluttered. The distinct lack of copy and paste throughout the show was also very refreshing. 10/10 art  team, well done.<br />
<br />
Next down on the list of numbers is the characters. Good ol&#039; characters. You know what? There are lots of them and they are good. Not what you might call amazing but considering the pace of the show (fast as hell), I think they have done really well. Almost everyone has at leas a minor bit of character development no matter how short there life span may be or how close to the main story they are. And on the off chance they don&#039;t get developed they are acknowledged strongly enough that you know they are real. No single character feels phoned in and aside from the occasional mob there is no mas melding of opinion, people are always butting heads over something. There are plenty of twists in the development of the main toon pile as well and most of the time it is a bit of a surprise. I say surprise and mean it but occasionally there are some ill timed or even impossible shifts in mood. This is another factor the dev team seemingly utilized in the telling of the story that mostly worked in there favor... mostly. As I mentioned before in my disclaimer there is a lot of girls in this one and it IS a touch ecchi so there was bound to be a good amount of.... let us say lesbianism going around. This is not entirely forced though. On many occasions it is in fact used to make a point about the world they are living in or to legitimately build character. Some times it works quite well as a point puter acrosser, but other times it falls short, and then there are times when it is just strait up fan service. It was unavoidable but it is also mostly good..... 8/10 characters let us move on.<br />
<br />
SOUND! Not a lot to say on this one. I am not one to pay much attention to the sound in anime, or anything really. Due to my work I have a gift for hearing when something is wrong but that is about it. With that being said I didn&#039;t hear anything wrong as fare as the soundtrack went in this one. The action pacing of it did mean there was always some sort of music going so a lot the background was drowned out but the fight noises were responsive and seemed different enough that they didn&#039;t just meld into explosion. Normally this sort of thing would only warrant a 6 or 7 from me but in this case its a solid 8 from the theme music. It just fits. I don&#039;t know what the words are in English, I didn&#039;t have that sub file, but it sounded right. So 8/10.<br />
<br />
Now the hard sell. Story. I say hard for what seems like a number of reasons, but relay its just one. I found it SUPER hard to pick up and follow over all. It seemed to take forever for the story to kick in and then it would piss off for an episode or two and come back. The hole thing was just so fast paced that each episode up until the last third felt like individual events that some how strung together. It was a simple mater to pick up on the &quot;foreshadowing&quot; for me but I cant say if that&#039;s because it was obvious or just my veteran status picking up the right bits. I know I have already told you how much I loved the different methods used to tell the story and I do stand by what I said. But telling a story well doesn&#039;t make it a good story. The problem being that this IS a good story. It is deep and full of emotion, conflict and real issues that face the human race, though it is a tad embellished (meh its anime). They just over paced it. It felt like they had something truly great in the works.... and then they gave it to Michael Bay. All being said there were no plot holes for me to dig out and the last 8 or so episodes saved it hard. I will be re watching this one down the line, probably after its dubbed, just to see if I can follow it a bit better. It dose have a somewhat &quot;Blade Runner&quot; feel to it in that I think I would understand more the second time around. So right now I am going with a soft 6. It was a good story when I could find it and it was told brilliantly and in interesting ways. But I can say it irked me how long it took to kick in and was defiantly not my favorite thing about this show.<br />
<br />
So to cap it all off. Right from the start this show goes hard. Balls to the wall. It&#039;s speed setting goes from about 8 up to 11+. It throws things at you constantly in what I assume is an attempt to keep you from following the story 100% but keep you entertained enough to keep watching, and it dos it SO well. All is grand with this show and I would say to all seasoned anime watchers to get on it. On the flip side though, if you are new to the sport of anime watching I would let this one rest till you have a winter or two under your belts. I have been at this game for almost twenty years (that&#039;s right I started animes when I was 7), and it took me a bit to latch on to this. I mean, I may just be a dumb ass. Stranger things have been proven true. But as a rule of thumb I find I pick up on things in anime quit well. I stand by the Masterpiece ratting I have given and defy any who think otherwise, but that&#039;s what the Internets are for and as I said, personal opinion. <br />

I have been Kergen and you have been reading this review. CONGRATS and go forth to bigger and better anime.

    This show is so horrible I am visibly impressed. Every other reviewer will have commented on the synopsis (or you may have wondered here due to the debate surrounding this show), so I&#039;ll skip straight to judgement. <br />
<br />
Sex, Nudity and the like.<br />
Unlike most other reviewers who rated this show horribly, I do not have (many) problems with the portrayal of nudity, yuri elements and rape in this show. The first episode isn&#039;t the problem, it is the structure, backbone and texture of the show which got to me. Also, blatant nudity and/or rape scenes do NOT make a show edgy. Read Punpun if you want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212974">
        a realistic portrayal of the consequences of abuse. The show sits firmly in the harem/yuri/man-child fantasy genre, and while this does not excuse its portrayal of women, it is reality in anime. <br />
<br />
Character Development.<br />
Tl:dr for everything below: don&#039;t bother watching this anime for character development, unless you think Guilty Crown was deep. In which case, watch, and ignore this review. You would miss the point I am trying to make and then flame me anyway. <br />
<br />
Ange as a character is often praised for having mature and realistic plot development. Her character is viewed as a strong female protagonist, and therein lies the problem. Firstly, I find issue with her character growth. Ange changes from a bigoted, ignorant princess to a tough, independent warrior in the space of six episodes. Throughout the rest of the series, she remains said tough, independent warrior. How in the world is this mature character development? Realistic character development occurs when a character changes so slowly you do not realize the character changed at all. Realistic development is when (spoiler alert for HxH) Gon snaps, and you suddenly realize that Gon&#039;s fearlessness and conviction is horrible, not heroic. You will then scroll back to the first episodes of Hunter X Hunter, wondering how this cheerful boy snapped, and you see that the author has been building up Gon&#039;s view of the world as black and white since the first episodes. You see the ways Gon ignores advice and is constantly convinced he&#039;s right. He&#039;s so charismatic that you (and Killua) forgets that Gon is a naive 10 year old boy who will be wrong at some point. Then the understanding dawns on you that Gon (and you) have been taught a lesson in how to behave in the world. (End spoiler for HxH). This does not happen in Cross Ange. How has Ange&#039;s character deepened throughout the series? She learns humility. She learns that the world is a horrible place. She learns to make decisions for herself. These messages are explicitly thrown at us, with characters saying them outright, repeating themselves over and over. Ange is shallow enough of a character that you can&#039;t portray depth in her, hence the need for the show hammering &quot;Look! Ange is now developing (insert moral strength here)!&quot; repeatedly into our brains. So Ange learns humility. Now what? What does she do with it? How is this newly found humility reconciled with her previous arrogance? ( hint: she&#039;s still arrogant, only now her arrogance is directed toward the &#039;evil royal sibling&#039;, so it is all okay). So she realizes that the world she knew and had control over is an illusion, easily shattered by a few words and a mana shield cast the the right time. How did she address her helplessness? She became a cold badass warrior (whines in pain as golden opportunity for complex development vanishes). Does she admit that the world is ultimately out of her control? No. Is the world out of her control? No, because she is the protagonist and has the power to change the &#039;system&#039;. It&#039;s certainly a fun trope to watch (remember Lelouch from Code Geass?), but it is hardly realistic. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the claim that she is a strong female protagonist irritates me. Why must a strong female protagonist be a gun-toting, independent sexy female? Why does her fighting her own battles makes her a stronger female character? This is coming from a feminist, so it will be hard to swallow. Skip on to the next paragraph for non-feminist criticism if you don&#039;t want to read this. Female protagonists are complicated. Make them into male protagonists with a female body and you have Ange. Make them too weak, and you have a non-existent character. Ange goes too far on the macho route. She is physically superior to most other characters in the show, despite being raised a princess. She is a textbook-tsundere, insulting people while (deep deep deep deep inside) sometimes caring for them. Remember Asuka from Neon Genesis? Ange is Asuka. But with more piloting skill and without the beautiful disintegration of the character near the end. She is the kind of female protagonist that makes me cringe whenever people name her as an example of a strong female character. As much as I wish female characters can be badass and invincible, having a strong female protagonist is more than toughness. It is understanding female limitations. It is realizing that we are fundamentally different from men, and embracing those differences. It is about portraying us as people, rather than as a sexualized, &#039;I will never cry&#039; masculine female. We see none of this in Ange. <br />
<br />
So Bad It&#039;s Good:<br />
I honestly think the author is making a parody with this. The humor and self depreciation that runs through the show makes it better than shows like Guilty Crown, which are inherently horrible AND take themselves altogether too seriously. The author frequently injects moments that keeps me watching until the end because I am half convinced that he/she is making fun of the audience. Take the last episode, for example. (spoiler alert) What self respecting show will have the female lead shout &quot; I won&#039;t let you have me, you lecherous man!&quot; while slicing apart the main villain? Also, the villain&#039;s main goal being &#039;I want beautiful independent women&#039; is so ridiculous I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the second arc of the show. How about the younger sister going around with a whip? What the hell is happening? (End spoilers). If the anime had wanted edgy, they would have gone the Elfen Lied route, also known as &#039;killing puppies&#039; induced feels. It feels like the writers started writing this god awful script, and some drunk guy at a party decided to challenge the writers to put the most ridiculous things they could get away with into the script without alerting the audience to the game. Honestly, it is entertaining. But so are many many other anime without the horrible eechi and yuri elements. <br />
<br />
Complex Themes ( 1/10 i.e.: What themes? There were themes?!)<br />
Rather than rant about the complete lack of &quot;complex themes&quot; within this anime, I&#039;ll provide examples of other anime where they were executed properly, and you can judge for yourself how well this anime deals with themes.<br />
<br />
Rape to break the character&#039;s will: I&#039;ll give this one to Cross Ange, although honestly, the shock value trumps the emotional reward its resolution brings. I&#039;ve already elaborated on how horribly Ange grows as a character, and this scene is mainly so we feel sorry for the main character. Also you cannot bring in &quot;realism&quot; and then have crazy things happening. It does not work that way. The prefect way to communicate dread and agony through abuse is perfectly done in Punpun, not in this anime. <br />
<br />
Manipulation by powers that be/Discrimination: Watch Shinsekai Yori. That show does not need to use a well loved princess to prove that a certain race can be bred to hate another. You will viscerally feel the hate, I promise. Bonus: yuri scenes in Shinsekai, yay! Psycho pass can be another, though Shinsekai pulls it off better.<br />
<br />
Clear communication/need for understanding: This. Good lord. Neon Genesis Evangelion dedicates about 99% of the show to demonstrate that clear communication between actual human beings is impossible. Clear communication is impossible. That is a fact we have to work around, not emphasize that &#039; if we could all just talk to one another properly, it will be fine!&#039;. That is why relationships are messy and friends end up killing one another. Talking to one another will not solve the problem. Talking to one another while wielding giant robots definitely will not solve the problem. Stop telling me it would, baka anime! <br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
Warning, do not watch. You will waste about 13 hours of your life watching while clutching your head, and a further four hours typing up a review so you can forever expel the anime from your head. <br />

    &quot;What a boring plot.&quot; - Embryo, 2015.<br />
<br />
And I couldnt agree more.<br />
<br />
I really looked forward to this anime, and when I saw all the good reviews, I was certain it was going to be good, but boy was I wrong! I will go through why I gave this anime as low as a 3, which I very rarely do.<br />
<br />
Story: 2.<br />
The story sounded very interesting on paper, but when you actually watch it, you notice that its filled with plotholes, and a massive amount of stupid fanservice. If you&#039;re into hentai, go watch that shit and not regular anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 5.<br />
Its not good, but its not bad either.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184225">
        The mecha and effects are pretty good, the background however feels a little boring.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8.<br />
The opening, ending and songs/Audio inbetween are pretty good, few complaints there, sound is in my opinion the best aspect of the anime.<br />
<br />
Character: 1.<br />
Boy, do the characters in this show suck, all they do is touch eachother and bitch. + there&#039;s the stupid guy MC who&#039;s weak and has all these shitty pervert accident moments, hopefully this anime will end in them all dying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1.<br />
The only enjoyment I got from watching so far was when people died.<br />
<br />
Overall 3: <br />
This sounded interesting on paper, but when you actually watch it, it lacks a lot. I was suprised how this got so good ratings, but I guess horny 12 year olds like anime too.<br />
<br />
This review was re-submitted, its my first one. What annoys me is that people dont rate reviews if they&#039;re good or not, they rate them if they agree or not.

    Oh boy this is going to be quite the controversial review to make, The main reason because of how much the show has really made the people who watched it so divided by those who think its good and those who think its bad. Il try to go into detail as to explain what are the pros and cons of this show and maybe dwell why so many people either hate it or dislike it.<br />
<br />
The series is either a hit or a miss…it is a hit because it focuses a lot of how society functions especially towards the discrimination of others which are different and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184514">
        how they threaten the stability and comfort they already have, as well as what it means to find your own since of individuality and since of moral towards around you, especially of the main heroine who developed from a spoiled, rotten and naive individual into a strong, intelligent, wise and caring leader. <br />
<br />
But it can also be a miss cause of the highly controversial subjects and the extremities of certain scenes as well plot holes and plot armour some of the characters get.<br />
<br />
I don’t know what happened at the studio that produced it but u can practically speculate there was a lot of confusion and divided opinion as to how this show was developed especially towards the beginning of the series.<br />
<br />
 As a matter of fact if u compare the first 5 or so episodes to the rest of the series, it is like watching two different shows altogether.<br />
<br />
The Animation was fantastic at times, especially in the fight scenes but in others the animation looked sloppy and messed up, the soundtrack on the other hand was probably the best thing the show had and the singing of the actors was superb for the most part. <br />
<br />
The characters were the second best thing that the series had, as their development throughout the show was something good to see, especially the main heroine as well as few of the side characters, but they are not perfect as there were a few character flaws that were really obvious or just to cliché that sometimes it makes u want to cringe and while the main characters and a few of the side characters did get proper development others were not so lucky in that some of them just simply hid in the background and never got much to say or do at all. <br />
<br />
The Sec jokes and fan-service might appeal to those who like it and not so much for those who don’t especially since some of the fanservice and jokes were used were so overused and repetitive that it makes u sick to watch after a while.<br />
<br />
thankfully these things dropped as the series went on and were not as much frequent as they were in the beginning. <br />
<br />
At the end I would say this show is either a hit or a miss depending on what a person is actually expecting from this show. There is also that old saying that a show is so bad that it is good and this series would defiantly be a perfect example for that.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: as an enjoyment I would rate it an 8,,, however as a whole series taken into account actually story writing, plot development, animation and characters, flaws and derps I would rate this a 6.75… as this show really could have been done better…what made it enjoyable despite this was mostly that by the middle of the series the series actually starts to thrive and use it flaws to make it more fun to watch. <br />

    Simply put, Cross Ange is a masterpiece in my eyes. Many will say &quot;But Ruggarell, just HOW? CROSS ANGE? MASTERPIECE? WHAT?&quot;. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Before Cross Ange aired last year, I saw it on the upcoming list of Anime that was coming out in the fall and being a fan of Ecchi it seemed like it would have a decent amount, so I gave it a go. I thought that I would have most likely would have dropped it anyway if the Ecchi segments weren&#039;t strong, but boy I got something entirely different. From the first 15 minutes of the Anime, it was blowing my mind.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review205363">
        The world that Cross Ange was set in was not indeed an equal or fair one.<br />
<br />
The 1st episode of Cross Ange made or broke the entire show for a lot of people but I was one of the few ones who kept going because of how exciting it was. Ange, the Main character, was the daughter of a very wealthy family and pretty much lived a comfortable lifestyle you see. Most of the world used magic as an everyday thing. Those who couldn&#039;t were seen as outsiders and thus rejected from society in very unpleasant ways that you will have to watch to find out. Ange, the MC was accused of being an outsider for not being able to use magic(Called normas), and thus sent to a prison. <br />
<br />
The 1st episode of Cross Ange was so well executed and so well made that I never missed a single week of the Anime. Each week had me on the edge of my seat waiting for something insane to happen and oh boy it did each and every week. You will have to watch for yourself. The character personalities are just so good and diverse that you will end up loving(or hating) many characters. The story is just so well paced that I couldn&#039;t possibly find anything wrong at all.<br />
<br />
If I were to write a list of every Anime that aired in 2014-2015 and someone asked me which one I loved the most, it would be Cross Ange. It&#039;s an Anime I will love forever because of how each episode was so well made. The story never let up at all. The director and writers always wanted you to be scared of what will happen next. It also had some dark humor in between as well that reminded you of the world that Ange lived in. Along the way she meets very crazy characters as well. <br />
<br />
I honestly wish that I could watch Cross Ange all over again for the first time because of how insane it is.  You might possibly cry and become depressed because there aren&#039;t anymore episodes to enjoy. I know I did. I loved the characters that much.<br />
<br />
Thank you Sunrise thank you so so much for yet another masterpiece. Here is hoping for a Cross Ange 2.

    I initially got into Cross Ange because of the fanservice and Yuri themes, episode one took me by surprise. It had me hating the main character and enjoying some of the negative things happening to her. However that feeling blew over and soon I started feeling bad for her and enjoying watching her grow, become stronger, and overtake the many obstacles she&#039;s had thrown at her. The show also started getting into some of the other main characters, letting a little focus off of Ange, this was also fantastic as the other characters (some you may find yourself hating at first) turn out to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review267375">
        just as broken as Ange is. This story leads you on some really big emotional rollercoasters, I found myself crying at some scenes before laughing at the next and enjoy the entire experience throughout. This anime can be pretty confusing if you don&#039;t pay close attention to detail, but I found myself completely immersed in the story and loving all of the main Characters by the end. Which brings me to my next point, the final episode is very well done and leaves you feeling good. Even though the characters have suffered loss, have been broken down emotionally and physically, and have no doubt been changed, this ending gives you the feeling of &quot;all is right&quot; in the world. I&#039;ve always dreaded endings of anime&#039;s because I typically dislike how many of them leave unanswered questions, I typically like to see a &quot;wrap up&quot; episode that goes after the &quot;final battle&quot; or what-have-you just to leave you on a more warm note as you wrap up the story, but this anime does not need it because it does such a good job on its own over the last few episodes. <br />
<br />
This anime will easily hold one of my top 10 anime&#039;s spots for quite a long time and the main character Ange is now easily one of my all time favorite characters. Please give this anime a chance, if you enjoy some fan service paired with an amazing story and characters you&#039;ll fall in love with then this is a great choice!

    Came to watch thinking it&#039;d be like infinite stratos, stayed because of the story.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s cut to the chase. ignore the ecchi, ignore the asspulls, ignore the budget on the animation, and you have an amazing anime. The plot was well thought out and good job to the writers. Never have I watched an anime where the characters seem to have more than one dimensional thinking and actually developed like decent human beings.<br />
<br />
Story? 10/10 <br />
Loved the unique storyline. It put a real twist on mecha series.<br />
<br />
Art? 9/10<br />
I thought the art was amazing at times. Animation was also great with fluid motions. Only downfall was some budgeted

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202964">
        animation where background trees, buildings, and people looked like potatoes but all is well. Some action scenes were cookie cutted from episode to episode but what mecha doesn&#039;t do that??<br />
<br />
Character? 11/10 (if only) <br />
I thought the characters were amazing. Each one had their own story. Each one had their own personality. They weren&#039;t stuck with one attitude. It actually felt like they had human minds with human emotions. Development was overall fantastic.

    This series is misogynistic as fu**! The appalling score not is only because the entire show´s elements (average animation, not memorable music, over twisted and repetitive story, typical end, plain characters, etc) are poor or average; if not that the messege of the show is totally awful! Entire cast are autodenominated women, but they are being controlled, humilliated and concern, over top, about the only two autodenominated men in the show.  And definitly Embryo is the representation of the extreme misoginity and patriarchalism essence...but also  &quot;fanservice&quot; or  better called standard  objectualism of woman and fetishistic lesbianism, are proofs of misogyny behind

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325308">
        the series...I don´t do reviews very often, but without a doubt this program is extreme about the misoginity that still exists in Japanese society and I feel as responsability expose it, and not take it only as a &quot;freedom of expression&quot; or &quot;creativity fiction&quot;, instead as the representation of a deep social problem in Japan.

    Hey guys! This is my very first review so I hope it being long doesn&#039;t bother you guys too much but I&#039;ll try my best to explain each category and why I absoutely loved this show. I&#039;m not really into mecha, but ironically Code Geass is one of my favorite shows of all time. A few days ago, I stumbled upon Cross Ange and the first thing that caught me was the female lead, no not in a sexual way, what I meant was it&#039;s refreshing to see a main female lead, especially in action shows. So I decided to watch (binge watched the whole

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194967">
        day for maximum experience) without really expecting anything, and by the time the show was finished, I just had to write a review.<br />
<br />
Now onto the review...<br />
<br />
Story: Not the most original concept of stories but the way the plot revolved around its own universe was really thrilling. The world revolved around magic called &quot;Mana&quot; and people who can&#039;t use it are discriminated. That&#039;s story revolves around Ange, our blonde main female lead, who is the First Princess of her own country and how she copes with the world they are in.<br />
<br />
Art: Well, nothing is really special about the art, but it does look great although the quality of the animation isn&#039;t very consistent. One thing that&#039;s very obivous is the CGI for this show, especially the mecha animations which honestly isn&#039;t the best looking, but then it&#039;s not just about the mechas, it&#039;s more on the story that drove me to look past it. <br />
<br />
Sound: Why an 8? The OP is amazing, it&#039;s upbeat and thrilling to hear, fitting for an action anime  and is sung by Nana Mizuki, also the VA for Ange. Cross Ange has a lot of quality VAs, and I&#039;m not gonna list each and everyone of them, but what captivated me the most are the songs sung by our quality VAs like Yui Horie and Nana Mizuki. The show DOES use singing during the action scenes but you&#039;ll understand if you watch why. The EDs were pretty forgettable though.<br />
<br />
Character: Oh boy, I don&#039;t know whether to hate or love the characters but, mainly Ange&#039;s  team or &quot;harem&quot; as people like to call it. Ange, the main character, has one of the most amazing developments in any anime I have ever seen and her character was consistent to the very end. She starts out as a bitchy, arrogant princess but she slowly turns into one very fitting of a &#039;hero&#039;. The supporting charscters are what baffled me because some of them do have great development, like Hilda, I swear she is easily  one of the best characters out of the show or any anime at least. However the other characters pretty much zigzagged throughout the show. Like their traits, motives are unexplained and such. But still that&#039;s just a minor problem that does not really bother the show unless you like nitpicking.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Not gonna lie here, this show is one of my favorite shows of all time, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed it is the fanservice. Yes, this show has fanservice dating back even to the very first one. I know this show isn&#039;t very well received and a lot have dropped it in 2 episodes only since they saw how shameless the fanservice was or what a &quot;trainwreck&quot; this will be, however, I was not deterred by the early fanservice, and I loved the yuri antics throughout, yes YURI. So, why is fanservice a good factor for the enjoyment? Because it&#039;s shameless! It doesn&#039;t hide this or that and isn&#039;t afraid to show scenes happening and we all know half-assed fanservice is very annoying. But the fanservice alone isn&#039;t the only thing that captivated me, the way the story presented all throughout, the hardships of Ange and her team to the very end is what made this show memorable and lovable. <br />
<br />
Overall: Every show has its flaws and Cross Ange is no different, but of course nothing is perfect. This show easily gets a 9 because it knows what it is and it doesn&#039;t hide that fact. If you enjoy a good story with great character interaction with fanservice thrown here and there, then you&#039;re in for a thrilling ride. If you are one of those people that tend to nitpick each and every small detail of flaws or mistake and expect a lot, then don&#039;t bother. However, I do highly suggest you give this show a chance.<br />

    Cross ange...I started this anime when it was ongoing. That was a big mistake because every single episode was outstanding and always i wanted to see the next one. If i could watch the whole series in a day i would definitely do it. This anime is the absolute ecchi,mecha, sci-fi experience which every fan of this genres would enjoy it the most but let&#039;s be more specific <br />
Story: well the main character of this anime is a teenage girl named Angelise. She lives in a world that lives by using &quot;mana&quot;<br />
Everything is only controlable by this kind of magic. But some girls can&#039;t use

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188999">
        it and they are known by society as &quot;Norma&quot;. They are hated by everyone and all calls them monsters. (Anyway it&#039;s not bad to be different but it&#039;s something extra ordinary) The police which caught these girls sent them to a secret location known to the 5% of the humaniy as Arzenal. These girls are sentenced to spent their life there and fight the D.R.A.G.O.N.s as they called in some kind of planes-spaceships-unifoms<br />
Art: The art i can say that it&#039;s absolutely stunning. Everything is well animated and fascinating <br />
Characters: hmm the characters are at a 98% girls and each of her has her own interesting story <br />
Sound: the sound is the best part of this series with Nana Mizuki singing the opening will keep your ears pleased in every single second <br />
Enjoyment : well I&#039;m not a mecha-science-fiction anime fan but i can say that i really enjoyed this anime series. Do not let the ecchi scenes take you away from the main plot. Of course it will have ecchi scenes cause it&#039;s based to a group of girls. If you are interested to something new and awesome you will definitely love this anime and i believe it deserves a 1000+ ranking (but that&#039;s only my opinion <br />

    Right well let&#039;s get to it, Cross Ange was a trainwreck from a start, it starts off happy like &quot;Oh yay i&#039;m the next heir to the throne of a massive futuristic city!&quot; To &quot;Holy shit I am the most hated human being in the entire city.&quot; in just one mere episode. I only decided to watch it because the the site I watch said anime on had tagged it with comedy.<br />
<br />
The first few episodes were a little weird, some being filler and some having blatant lesbians fucking but I honestly can&#039;t say it&#039;s bad the art is pretty decent, the soundtrack is pretty amazing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185385">
        and though the story line was a little weird at first it actually slowly got better as time progresses and you learn that some of the characters who were mean to Ange weren&#039;t actually half bad in the end.<br />
<br />
Embryo is still an asshole though.

    *May contain minor spoilers<br />
Cross Ange is one really good anime that alot of people dropped cuz of the first 4 episodes and i think its not fair to dislike it because of that i hated it as well even though opinions swayed me into thinking that i got around to watching it and i was really interested....it def isn&#039;t for everyone its kind of all over the place though.<br />
<br />
Story- very good to say the least once it hits episodes 5 and onwards it really depends on your preference the early part will make you dislike the main character like to the point where you wanna

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184265">
        see her die but she grows on you overtime and you eventually take a liking to her well i did at least. You can read the synopsis on it for the plot of the story, but without spoiling i will say its a journey to say the least. Mecha is a big part in this anime along with the sci-fi aspect alot of fanservice and gruesome scenes, singing is also a big part of the anime its not like its everywhere but its because it has to do story and fits in but it seems kinda dumb to be really honest but that aside a very good story.<br />
<br />
Art- it&#039;s good but theres times when you can see that the animations seem kinda laggy like it had frame issues but its really rare the first episode has an audio issue idk if its where im watching from but other sites had the same issue with cross anges first episode. Another thing i didnt like about the art style was the delayed speaking animations what i mean is i mentioned singing is a big part already but some of the scenes while there singing the character&#039;s mouth isnt moving at the proper time so it looks off but it sounds great. Other than that No complaints. Mecha looks very well done as well. Other then few inconsistencies i thought the art and animation looked good<br />
<br />
Sound- Great i liked the first half of the series op and ending not so much the second half but the battle themes are great sometimes. There are moments when a random song doesnt fit into the fight scene like imagine a crazy battle mecha style and then hearing i sad song in the heat of the fight when nothing bad has happend thats what some scenes felt like in cross ange and i wish they removed it while editing the show if they did. Character songs are good some sound angelic honestly why i was so attracted to alot of the scenes and had to rewind if i just wanted to hear it again its that good.<br />
<br />
Character- Variety of characters although many dont get through by the end of the series they are likeable for what they are as you get deeper into the anime theres a few characters that will grow on you the main character grew on me and a few side characters and 2 other main characters. But im here to tell you cross ange is one of the best ive seen in its 2014-2015 run to me and anime when it comes to main character development i mean it was like you really noticed it and thats what i really loved a minor spoiler ima throw your way not really about the characters themselves but the main character has about 3 character changes in personality and attitude from beginning to end and a few other characters also had more than 1 character change. Although not all the characters are all that loveable the development you get is an easy 9/10 it was really well done even with the anime cliches with hero and villains.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10/10 i dont really watch all that mecha anime to be brutally honest ive seen about 5 and aside from code geass. Cross ange slips into my number two and onto my all time favourite anime list when i look back. Character development is top notch, Good story although the fanservice was overkill sometimes im an ecchi lover so it didnt bother me but its not in the ecchi genre yet it had a ton of fanservice moments, visually looked good not great, Great battle songs &amp; character songs as well as the op and end from the 1-12 ep mark and i really just liked it. It goes 24 episodes nothing really seems rushed besides the last episode i guess.....other than that the pacing is well done it was really great i wish more people would give it a chance.<br />
<br />
Overall- 9/10 id say more so an 8.5 but lets not muddy things up here.<br />
<br />
Likes/Dislikes-  Likes: Music, Art, Story, some of the fanservice, main character and few side characters, <br />
<br />
Dislikes- Short pure fight scene, Too much fanservice, Random events, delayed animations (barely any), Petty highschool girl bullying stuff, Disturbing yuri/ecchi  fanservice scenes and disturbing sexual fanservice scenes.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading a reuploaded final copy review of my thoughts on the series.<br />

    I would be lying if I didn&#039;t say this series was dreadful; in fact, it&#039;s garbage. I want to get one thing out of the way before we continue, and that&#039;s that I don&#039;t think the characters themselves are horrible, but that all the effort that did go into this series was clearly from the VA&#039;s and nobody else. How does one sit by and watch a trainwreck? Well, aren&#039;t you in for a ride.<br />

Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo is what you get when you mix Gundam with the magical girl genre and toss in some bad writing and worse animation. The series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195982">
        kicks off with Angelise (A princess of some kind) telling the mother of a &quot;Norma&quot; (the people who can&#039;t perform magic) that her kid is a freak and to stop giving birth. The next day, the pampered princess is revealed to be a Norma herself (and because her maid did everything magic-related for her, she didn&#039;t need to do it herself) and gets sent off to prison. After being bitch-slapped, near-raped, told she&#039;s trash, and essentially kicked into the mud, she grows a pair and becomes the equivalent of Buffy cosplaying sailor moon and piloting a gundam.<br />
<br />
The problems with the series isn&#039;t the characters; I quite enjoyed myself some lesbian relationships. The issues stem from the production standpoint, where the studio seemed unsure of how strong their &quot;strong, female protagonist&quot; should be. This lead to Ange often forgetting how to be strong for her own sake and instead laying down and crying herself silly until someone came by and told her to grow a pair. The other characters often range from silly to endearing and, with the last handful of episodes, just obnoxious. I would suggest first-timers go as far as Arzenal getting wrecked and stop there. You&#039;ll thank me later.<br />
<br />
The animation is also pretty subpar, and that&#039;s complimenting the series. A lack of effort went into the mecha fights (where it should have really shined) and at times you wonder what you&#039;re watching. The character designs are, for the most part, your usual fair. The settings and backdrops are unfortunately &quot;okay&quot; despite the attempt at some interesting designs. Also, a lot of the fights take place over an ocean because.<br />
<br />
What can I say about the music? It&#039;s personal taste, but only the song the protagonist sings is memorable at best.<br />
<br />
The issues with this series unfortunately overshadow the pluses. The main gundam of the series, Vilkiss, only exists to move the plot forwards and, perhaps self-aware of this fact it picks and chooses when to do so. The villain is hilariously-bad and suffers from being a horny fuck who has gone a thousand years without. Yes, that&#039;s the reason he sucks at his job so bad; he hasn&#039;t had any in a thousand years. The protagonist earns her applause by telling him so and to go fuck himself right before doing the deed for him. <br />
<br />
In fact, the entire series is an allegory for having sex. The lesson? Sunrise is full of horny, old farts. Now, go watch something better.

    Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo (2014)<br />
<br />
What a ride from such a hidden gem since here we have mecha, action, adventure, great story progression and plenty of ecchi. <br />
<br />
The plotline for this is similar to a few shows with the mastermind of evil who had good intentions at one point gone crazy with a people rejected for being different by those living in a false peace. I can honestly say that it is a pretty good show throughout. Aside from plenty of Yuri and dragon girls, we have a pretty great cast to add. <br />
<br />
The show progresses through the 25 episodes to a great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354763">
        conclusion that is very satisfying. It gives the good people and those who sought redemption their reward and those side characters that acted horribly an actual fate that is not just forgiveness. This is unusual and I loved it.  <br />
<br />
The art of the show has aged superbly for 2014/2015. It is a show that in 20 years time or so will still be easily watchable. Graphically speaking the show is very crisp unless like all anime you pause between frames. <br />
<br />
The OP and ED of course changes and are very fun. The ED is the better side of the music. Generally sounds throughout are a great SFX and strong throughout. You do get a few scenes of people needlessly talking but it doesn&#039;t go on for too long. <br />
<br />
Characters are wide and varied. <br />
<br />
Fake humans are generally awful people and get justice. <br />
Normas the people who are outcast by the fake humans are treated abysmally but do develop amazingly. <br />
The real humans are awesome, the girls are extremely cute I love how they look and act. What a dream. <br />
<br />
Characters would take too long to go into each of the main cast since many supporting is very much main. <br />
<br />
My top girls would be:<br />
<br />
1.Vivian<br />
2. Salia<br />
3. Salamandinay <br />
4. Chris<br />
<br />
I tend not always to love the actions of the main character like Ange since she is ruthlessly violent towards men whereas the others have more reasons for their brash actions. She is a good girl though. Her sister Sylvia is very easy to dislike but hard when she gets better at times to then like. She does, however, grow throughout the show into a nicer aspect of being.  <br />
<br />
In terms of enjoyment, I can say I loved it from start to finish. The ecchi side is very much there but doesn&#039;t ruin the plot. The show is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a solid 9.<br />
<br />
I would suggest everyone who likes a great story and some mecha to watch this. It is truly a hidden gem. It has a great ending to finish off the show entirely.
