    This movie is a re-imagination of basic Saint Seiya concepts. It uses the Zodiac Temples Arc as a base to its plot. So, I&#039;ll consider it as an original work for the most part in this review, as I don&#039;t like taking something as a bad thing just because it isn&#039;t the same as the old one. The problem is, Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary has a big flaw in its concept: you can&#039;t fit this Arc in a single movie, no matter how hard you try.<br />
<br />
Lot of concepts are left open because the movie doesn&#039;t have time to explain them to you. While it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review163091">
        settles a new universe in Saint Seiya franchise, it can&#039;t explain itself without relying on fan&#039;s knowledge.<br />
<br />
Due do the movie format, most of the Gold Saints have no personality at all. With the exception of Aldebaran, Aiolia and Death Mask, they couldn&#039;t look more like coadjutors. Milo, who was one of the best re-imagined characters, suffered with little screen time. Aphrodite almost didn&#039;t appear at all.<br />
<br />
The art was fantastic. The movie&#039;s style is a mix of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, with heavy anime influence, specially in humor scenes. Overall, visually speaking, the battles were very well done. The first appearance of Aiolia created an epic atmosphere. They changed visuals for a lot of characters, Milo even changing gender. I received this all with a positive reaction. Unfortunately, the fights are really short because the movie doesn&#039;t have time and the story needs to go on.<br />
<br />
The same can be said about the sounds effects. Ambient and movement sounds were very good and matched what we consider an AAA production.<br />
<br />
Being honest, I don&#039;t think this movie was bad. I enjoyed it. But its pretty clear you can&#039;t tell a story like this in one hour and half, and the move suffers from its stupidly fast peace. I would love to see this universe of Saint Seiya in another format like a CG series, even with lower production value. But, in the end, its an &#039;original&#039; story that can&#039;t explain itself and feels too rushed.

    &quot;And this is not even my final from!!!&quot;<br />
-Saga<br />
<br />
&quot;Same for me!&quot;<br />
-Seiya<br />
<br />
As a huge fan of the original series of Saint Seiya, I was really expecting something incredible before watching it. But now that I think about it, when was the last time Toei made something good?<br />
<br />
But let&#039;s get to the point, this movie isn&#039;t really faithful to the original story.<br />
As expected from a 90-minutes movie, it skips a lot of content (only 5 fights against the gold saints), and needs to adds some bullshit to tie it together.<br />
The movie is really fast-paced and in the end the story doesn&#039;t make much sense.<br />
So, this movie isn&#039;t for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179733">
        die-hard fans, but it&#039;s also so fast that it can&#039;t really pander to those who are new to Saint Seiya.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, most of them only have a few seconds of screentime. For exemple, the fight &quot;Hyoga vs his master&quot;  was really anti-climatic because of the fact that Hyoga was shown for like 30 seconds on screen, so nobody cares about his master if you haven&#039;t seen the anime.<br />
<br />
What else can I add? Deathmask is now a moron, Milo is a girl and aphrodite shows up just to die 5 seconds later. <br />
<br />
But besides that, this movie shows us some really good CGI and the fighting scenes are really good. <br />
We all know that Toei Animation is an awful studio when it comes to animation, but that only applies to TV series. They know how to make a movie appealing to the eyes.<br />
As for the OST, it isn&#039;t bad but is easily forgettable.<br />
<br />
So, this movie isn&#039;t a masterpiece but is actually really fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone who is bored and just wants to watch something that is just mindless fun.

    Saint Seiya : Legend of Sanctuary is a movie which related to the name with the same title, Saint Seiya. <br />
<br />
Most of you must think that this movie will summarizes the anime series, but it wont&#039; happen. This is the story which you will not find in the anime series though both of them has same characters.<br />
<br />
The minus score of this movie just in the story. The art is well done, beautiful and so real. The voice actors work perfectly in making the dialogues so natural. The characters which same with the anime also great, in addition the elegant characters of the 12 Gold Saints

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170415">
        of Zodiac. <br />
<br />
The concept of the story is actually good. The saints wanna save the Athena from death and they must passed the Temple of Zodiac which means has 12 levels.  The four of them, which just bronze, must defeat the 12 Gold Saints. And I thought, &quot;Hey, they will become so strong to defeat all of the Gold Saints, don&#039;t they?&quot; But in the end, it didn&#039;t satisfy my expectation. The duration is so short, only an hour and half, and it can&#039;t contain all the concept. The result? It feels like the story is fast-forwarded, and the Gold Saints didn&#039;t seems to be that strong.<br />
<br />
Although the story is lack of something, overall this movie is still enjoyable to be watched. The humor is filling this movie smoothly. And even though you never watch the anime, you can still understand the purpose of this movie. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading till the end. ^^

    Saint Seiya legend of sanctuary is a film that, at least for me, looked very striking and interesting from a distance, but in the end I was quite disappointed. I must say that this movie is not as bad as I had heard, I would even recommend it (even though it was not to my liking) for some points that the movie fulfills.<br />
<br />
First of all we must say that the film is not decided very well between if it is a movie for very &quot;loyal&quot; or &quot;hardcore&quot; fans of Saint Seiya or for those who do not know much about the original work and want

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298092">
        to introduce themselves (it is true that I I am not one of the 2, I saw Saint Seiya recently and I liked it, but I do not consider myself a big fan). But this idea is very contradictory throughout the entire film, starting from the beginning where Tatsumi (Saori&#039;s butler) explains the whole &quot;plot&quot; of the original work to Saori in such a sudden and unbelievable way , literally exude all the concepts to the viewer suddenly, resulting suddenly for those who do not have much idea about Saint Seiya and being very hasty for those who did see the manga or the anime, I would say that this is one of the worst scenes of all the movie, but do not take much importance, since the film did not have enough time to develop in its entirety (the fact that the film did not have much time when 3 characters were very irrelevant and wasted).<br />
<br />
Another point that disappointed me enough about the movie were the personalities and actions of the most iconic characters of Saint Seiya, Hyoga is someone &quot;badas and cool&quot; instead of that loyal, sensitive (he lets himself glimpse in the battle against Camus, against Isaac and when he sees the illusion of Camus) and intelligent gentleman that was in the original work, Hyoga may be the main character character with less personality in the original work for some, but for me it was well constructed throughout the scenes and the reasons that are known from the beginning, I would say that here you can see again the little time that the series had, the personality of Hyoga is not explored even in the battle against Camus, that is because the movie did not have time to show their past or motivations, so the battle against Camus does not generate an emotion or satisfaction for the fact that Hyoga has outdone his teacher, here in the movie was only to get some special effects of gall or, show facial expressions of pain and grief without any reason for the fact that the viewer is supposed to already know about Camus and Hyoga (I say and I talk a lot about Hyoga because he is the character that most contradicts the idea of ​​the film being for all public that even know Saint Seiya), the battle in my opinion is by far the worst of the whole movie presided by the great difference of emotion and context between the film.<br />
Unfortunately Hyoga is not the only one who undergoes such a drastic change, Ikki also suffers from the same, but much worse, Ikki, who is supposed to be the tough guy, but who feels empathy for your team and always tries to help them, it was the personality more suited to the character that always served to defeat the strongest enemy (see Shaka, Kanon and Aiocos in his part), in his part that was what made Ikki so iconic characterizing him as someone strong who does not waver (this personality even it complemented the fact that he was the eldest and always Shun called him older brother). The personality that Ikki has in the film in my opinion is very bad, starting from the fact that he has no outstanding personality, that is because he appears 2 times in the movie and his dialogue is very bad, he says nothing about it and It seems that their dialogues want to look great, but the fact that Ikki appears so little makes these dialogues quite empty and irrelevant, so I would say that Ikki is the worst character in the entire film, added to the fact that he does not defeat no one important in the whole movie,this is very disappointing because Ikki is usually the most surprising character in the series, but the character could easily be removed from the film without causing a big impact or even bother the viewer, Ikki happened to be a character that had an impact and that was strong to one that is simply nothing, neither in personality nor in actions.<br />
I would say that Shun would say that he is the character most faithful to his original personality in a certain part, he is the most gentleman of the team and he knows how to speak with respect to all his team, the personality of Shun remains the same but he can not do good chemistry with Ikki nor with the others because of the little depth and because of the very bizarre changes that it has, one could say that Shun&#039;s personality remains fairly stable in comparison, but we can not see his side that does not want to fight because he does not have any battle, wait to talk about Shun to mention another very big problem that the series has, the changes of personality can be passable or even very good, but because of the little depth of the characters you can not rescue much of the personality, we do not know how they trained or that they learned through the years or the relationships they had with some characters, but the film wants the viewer to know that, cutting the important parts tantes of dialogue and wanting to create something different without knowing what the audience is focused on and that causes a lot of plot flaws, the characters want to protect Saori without any reason, they do it because if, by not deepening their past we do not even know if it is that they were raised for that, in the end the idea of ​​wanting to create a Saint Seiya movie for people who are fans and those who are not fans results in a contradiction too great for all the failures.<br />
Seiya and Shiryu are the characters that least bother me since Shiryu maintained a personality very faithful to the original and Seiya because I could notice a bit of evoulucion as Seiya assumes his defeat against Aioria before going to the 12 houses, otherwise I could say that the first personality of Seiya seemed very good to me, the fact that first of all its strength and the angle that the camera is shown when Seiya puts on the armor for the first time seemed to me a very good scene and that easily serves as an introduction for the great animation that waits in the following battles, the only thing that I would say about Seiya is that his personality is very annoying to me and also the fact that he has captured all the attention in the whole movie, the normal Seiya was recognized for being the stereotype of shonen acceptable for his time, is not the best, but certainly is better than an arrogant and pretentious adolescent, Seiya is a character who is very unpretentious because his topics are almost &quot;I&#039;m going to take care of Saori without reason&quot; and nothing else, his goals to save it may be more justifiable by the little flashback that is done about how Saori healed his wound, but the flashback is too short to think that is important ( besides, that memory is never mentioned later). For me Seiya is the most passable character, the only bad thing is his annoying personality.<br />
On the other hand Shiryu does not change much, Shiryu is still the wisest character among the 5 knights, without falling into pedantic or pretentious phrases Shiryu can be considered the wisest due to the caution and determination he has in battle, the battle of Shiryu against Death Mask does not convince me either for many reasons, the drastic change between the house of cancer, which motivates Shiryu to fight and the Death Mask personality made that at first he reacted in a rather negative way to his fight, the great change of Death Mask spoiled one of the best moments of the saga of the 12 houses, in the original work Shiryu gains strength because Death Mask attacked Shunrei, someone that Shiryu appreciates a lot, that made sense because of the context that had the battle, in the movie Shiryu gains strength for Saori, this seemed very unbelievable because Shiryu knew Saori for less than a week so Shiryu&#039;s motivation makes me very poor, outside of that it seemed to me that the battle is quite faithful to the original, so this battle at least has something salvageable, because they do not invent any kind of power to get out of the way of combat, although it is a pity that this is their only battle and I could not face Shura, that was one of my biggest disappointments, along with the fact that there is no battle against Shaka and Aphrodite.<br />
Now that I mention Shaka and Aphrodite I want to take the opportunity to say that I expected their battles a lot, especially Shaka against Ikki, but in the end Shaka does not even fight against anyone in particular, Shaka is the strongest of those golden knights, but in the movie does not fight because of the excuse that he knew the truth during the 13 years, it does not seem so convincing, but I&#039;ll let it go (although that is relieved in a way that seems to be irrelevant in that dialogue), at least Shaka appears in an epic way saving Seiya from being finished by Aioria, that scene turned out good.<br />
Aphrodite, on the other hand, is totally &quot;erased&quot; from the movie he did absolutely nothing, this in my opinion is inexcusable since the attacks of Aphrodite are probably the most simpples among all the golden knights, even with his battle could have shown another facet of Shun in combat, but nothing came up Aphrodite is treated like trash being murdered by the great patriarch in a very patetic and very hurried way, the great patriarch looked like a spoiled child who was angry and that&#039;s why I killed Aphrodite. Afroita was what bothered me most in the whole movie, instead of spending time with the monster form of Saga (which certainly has no explanation or logic) they would have spent in the battle against Shun, where his would have revealed that a of Shun&#039;s motivations is to avenge his teacher.<br />
Saga also turns out to be quite mediocre because all its presentation and explanation of motives turns out to be very flat and hurry, I&#039;m not going to take much time explaining this since the saga of this movie is just an enemy like any other, very different from the one of original work where he had a personality problem that was taken very seriously in the original work, its monstrous form was very elaborate and it does not make sense to be there, at least thanks to Saga the best scene of the film was produced, this is when the golden knights face a giant statue, not only the animation I like, but also the feeling of union and team that emerges, Saint Seiya has always been characterized precisely by the teamwork and brotherhood of the elect of golden knights , I saw that scene very much.<br />
The way in which Seiya defeats Saga is very reminiscent of the classic, Seiya with the power of Athena and the armor of Sagittarius can defeat Saga, i do not have any complaints here, I would even say that I&#039;m excited to see those scenes for the scenarios, the animation, the facial gestures and the music, all well used and complemented to create a good fight scene, although hopefully the end would not have been just about Seiya, it is true that he gets power from his friends, but in the end they do not do much more, in the original work Ikki helped a lot on that subject, but here it was all concentrated in Seiya (besides the arm that brings out the power of all his friends was amazing, I gave him a nod regardless of whether it is a power up or not).<br />
Another of the moments that I found very elaborate is when Milo and Shura read the text that Aiolos left about Athena, literally reading that they went against the great patriarch without hesitation, there was not even a key dialogue to show their confusion (now I must say that my favorite dialogue is the one Seiya has with Athena before the arrow is stuck in him), Mu also falls in the same bag, appears intimidatingly looking like he wants to fight, but when he feels the cosmos of Athena he surrendered and I swear allegiance to Athena, if it were not for I saw the manga I would not have understood Mu&#039;s big change, but it&#039;s not the worst scene by far, if you&#039;re not very precise or you do not want to judge everything it&#039;s possible to overlook that scene of Mu, the part that if it is out of place and that in my opinion is horrible is the introduction of Death Mask when the protagonists enter the house of Cancer, that &quot;musical&quot; was so out of place and so far from someone as Death Mask which in my opinion had to have been eliminated, that can easily be the worst scenes of the whole class.<br />
The setting of the film is quite peculiar, but not unpleasant, from the new design of the armor to the visual of the whole sanctuary, everything is seen with a new and attractive aesthetic, the fact that everything has a futuristic touch and cyberpunk I liked, the armor even seem like a wick in minatura, with the correct animation that idea can work and the movie showed that, so I must give a nod to the setting. The design of the 12 houses also seems great, in case the scenes of the film seem good, the 12 houses are no longer the typical pillars that appear monotonous (except for Geminis that does not even appear, that it bothered me a bit since I was expecting the fight against the great patriarch manipulating the Gemini armor), the use of scenarios is key and the film knows that, fulfilling in an exceptional way in that area.<br />
It&#039;s time to comment on the beautiful and very well achieved animation, soundtrack and facial gestures, every technical and visual theme in the film deserves my applause, the attacks look great and are very consistent with the character that uses them, the soundtrack complement somewhat the decent battles that the film has (I would say that the best battle is when Shura and Milo appear), the music sometimes failed to be used at very wrong times and unfortunately, but that is not to deny that when they wanted to complement a battle with soundtrack they did, the facial gestures are beautiful by themselves, represent very well the emotion that the characters feel and that&#039;s why the facial gestures contain details that lets you know more about the character, that set of technical elements It made it totally worth seeing the movie.<br />
At the end I just want to say that the proposal of this movie I liked, the CGI animation looks good and, although there are some characters that look horrible with the new aesthetics, most of them look interesting and complement their personality, even see Milo woman bothers me, I would even say that I liked it, the film tries to do many novel things, but that does not mean that this good, a bad idea taken ill is worse than a series of cliches since a novel series had more opportunities, here I think the same thing happens, some new things come out as the aesthetic, the animation of the attacks and the scenarios / setting, but others are horrible as the characters or the rhythm of the story that only consists of a short confrontation without depth because we do not &quot;know&quot; the characters, I would recommend the film to a certain audience, but it is not a movie that I like very much.<br />

    I actually enjoyed the movie! It really helps if you know the story and characters of Saint Seiya, prior knowledge of Saint Seiya to around episode 50 and you&#039;ll be good. If you don&#039;t know anything about Saint Seiya, I think you can still enjoy it, though it may seem very fast-paced and unexplained. I really enjoyed it because the fights and armors are really EPIC and the 3D was cool as fuck! Great Soundtrack! This movie was dope. I especially liked when Seiya equips his armor and mask, the mask zips and closes like those mecha robots. The Gold Saints are all so cool

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229710">
        and awesome!<br />
<br />
First, I think the story in the movie is very fast too and you are at a disadvantage if you don&#039;t know the Saint Seiya story. But I think the movie is set up so you can get the most out of it. As the movie also is for people who haven&#039;t seen Saint Seiya, the movie is trying to give everyone a NEW EXPERIENCE, one you can like probably without ever knowing the original Saint Seiya. <br />
<br />
The story in the movie is not a summary of the original Saint Seiya story. The movie takes the original storyline and while still following it, shortens the story by slightly adapting events in a shorter way. They would cut off parts from the original Saint Seiya and condense the story to what&#039;s most important, then transition the story in the movie exclusive way that works. It felt natural, flowed nicely, and was told in a pretty understandable way so I welcomed the change. You will not miss any plot. The one thing they could&#039;ve done better is introducing the characters since if you don&#039;t know who Ikki is, you won&#039;t even know when he first showed up, but his sudden badass appearance was more like a reward for only Veteran Saint Seiya fans that know! <br />
 <br />
Ironically, Veteran Saint Seiya fans I bet have a problem with the movie because &quot;this is not the Saint Seiya that they knew&quot;. Basically changes that drifted what Saint Seiya is from Saint Seiya. They think the story is rushing, butchered, the Bronze Saints personalities were genericized, and some of the Gold Saints changed from what they were in the original Saint Seiya. I can relate to that, but as I&#039;ve already pointed out, the movie is trying to give everyone, veteran or not, a new, fresh experience to Saint Seiya. The movies and series are not trying to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
The loosely adapted story gives veterans a spin to the story they are familiar with and the fact the story jumps so fast cannot be helped either as this is a 1 hour 30 minute movie. The base of the story is not to tell the whole story, but to create stages for awesome action to take place. One can feel the excitement seeing Seiya&#039;s Pegasus Ryuusei ken again in kickass 3D fights. <br />
<br />
How the Bronze Saints in the movie seemed to got generic with added comical relief was fine. The original Saint Seiya Bronze Saints were great because they had their own individual characters. The Bronze Saints memorably envokes the feelings of the audience as each one struggled, how they were tested their ability to fight and believe, and how they were each trialed as opponents tries to bend their will. In the movie where the audience not all of them know Saint Seiya, it is better they unify all of the Bronze Saints as more or less the same, generic, brave, flirtatious, fun young guys with the common goal to bodyguard a clueless young girl who is actually Athena so we can pay less attention on their background and more on their resolve. To fight and win for Athena. A battle for us Bronze Saints! It is an effective replacement for character development and reducing the required experience you need with the original Saint Seiya.<br />
<br />
More shockingly to Veterans may be some of the liberty the staff took when some of the Gold Saints got changed. I think there was a lot of good changes, but Veterans may not be used to them. If you go in and kick back to enjoy the reimagining of Saint Seiya, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have fun! Personally, I really like Aries Mu and how he got glasses just in the movie and Taurus Aldebaran was badass with his strong build and power. He is my favorite Saint in this movie! Cancer Deathmask made me laugh my ass off with his singing and I liked him here, he was cool. In the original Saint Seiya, I didn&#039;t like him since he was such an asshole. Scorpio Milo got turned into a girl, but that was just an interesting change to give something new. He was a good candidate for that because all Scorpio Saints have the Scarlet Needle attack where they attack with their long sharp painted fingernails which can be associated as feminine. How Leo Aiolia stayed so accurate to the original Saint Seiya was probably the most important part and I&#039;m really happy they kept it. What&#039;s even more boss was how I saw Virgo Shaka block off and stop Leo Aiolia&#039;s attack on Andromeda Shun when Leo Aiolia was under mind control from the Pope in this movie exclusive only scene! Capricorn Shura, Aquarius Camus, and the Pope were done very well! Pisces Aphrodite had his own &quot;I got KOed&quot; scene and I found that funny since I didn&#039;t really care about Pisces Aphrodite in the original Saint Seiya anyways.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t judge this movie by its score, I think it&#039;s a really enjoyable movie with fantastic action and badass designs for Saint Seiya fans or non fans alike! Have fun watching :)<br />

    First off, let&#039;s get this out of the way, Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary isn&#039;t the greatest anime movie out there, and it isn&#039;t exactly the best SS movie either - but you could do a lot worse. What it IS, is another good addition to the Saint Seiya franchise.<br />
<br />
 The movie&#039;s greatest weakness is that it tries to condense a whole 50+ episode arc (not sure if it&#039;s that long, don&#039;t quote me on that, but it is pretty freaking long) into a 90 minute film, and that just makes the whole thing suffer from an unstable progression, a rushed plot, and untouched and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172437">
        unreferenced character backgrounds that SHOULD have been part of the movie for character development. There&#039;s a reason the story and the characters are this movie&#039;s low points. In all honesty, the movie needed at least another 45 min. to an hour to clear the air of every bit of exposition needed.<br />
<br />
Legend of Sanctuary tries to allure to the original Sanctuary Saga while at the same time trying to be it&#039;s own thing. But the way it presents itself is sort of confusing and contradicting. I read that this movie was meant to be a retelling of the Sanctuary Saga with a not-so-faithful interpretation of the events that transpired in the original anime&#039;s arc, and that all the aesthetic changes were all made to appeal to new and old audiences alike, but when characters are dropped in the middle of the stage without so much as an explanation for their pasts, which comes in conflict later off, newcomers are bound to feel like they&#039;re missing something and only old school fans will really get the whole picture. Heck, some people left cinema&#039;s not even understanding what the Cosmo was, and that&#039;s established in the first 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
 In contrast, however, they made the characters really engrossing and entertaining (with both strenghts and weaknesses of character being explored in the movie), some more than others. The new Athena is a case of redeemability for me, since she&#039;s actually likable and relatable - at least, she&#039;s much more relatable than Saori Kido from the Saint Seiya anime, where she was portrayed as this holier-than-thou Mary Sue in distress, and who was impossible to understand if she was Athena in the body of Saori Kido, Saori with the grace, powers and divinity of the goddess Athena, or a mix of both. Though the new Athena is great, some of the relations between fellow Gold Saints, and the main villain, were not added due to the movie&#039;s lenght. Milo for example, who was one of the best re-imagined characters, suffered very little screen time, just enough for a quick Bronze Saint trashing and nothing more. And Aphrodite? He&#039;s introduced just to say: &quot;Hey, remember the last Gold Saint? You know, the androgenious looking one with the whole Pisces and Rose motive going on? Yeah, he&#039;s here too&quot;, and he **** the very next scene.<br />
<br />
On the art front everything was breathtaking and spectacular. The movie&#039;s style reminds me of a mix of Square-Enix&#039;s CGI cutscenes with and the expressiveness of Pixar, with large injections of heavy shounen. Overall, the visual and the fights might just be the movie&#039;s best feature. The changed aesthetics and visuals were some of the very best and most interesting redesigns I&#039;ve ever liked in any characters, and fictional world and lore. They changed visuals for a lot of characters, Milo even changing gender.<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie is still enjoyable and deserves to be watched by fans and non-fans alike. Although the time restrictions caused the passing to be rushed as heck, the humor, the visuals, the music and even most of the cast fill in what the movie lacks nicely. Purist will see it as an abomination, as the Super Mario Bros live-action movie of Saint Seiya-dom, but regular fans will delight in what it has to offer. The transition of a very hefty anime arc into a 90 min. animated film, may have costed us a perfect adaptation, but what we got is pretty dang enjoyable.<br />

    Legend of Sanctuary is the 40th anniversary special of the Saint Seiya franchise. It was made to be a very loose retelling of the Sanctuary arc with a lot of differences, as it was condensing several chapters of the manga into a 1 and a half hour movie.<br />
<br />
Now, you would think that would be a recipe for a disaster, as these types of endeavors typically always end with the characters and plot suffering immensely...but somehow, that isn&#039;t ENTIRELY true here.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, the individual characters don&#039;t have a lot of time since there are so many of them, and the character arcs aren&#039;t really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184188">
        as fleshed out as they are in the original show. So in that sense, yeah, the movie definitely suffered from being so condensed. <br />
<br />
The thing that makes that not nearly as bad as you would think is that the bits of characterization we DO see have been GREATLY modernized and retooled. It&#039;s apparent to me that even though this was obviously going to be mainly a special-effects fest meant for older fans of the series, some effort was made to update the characters to be more contemporary.<br />
<br />
For example, Seiya is still a shounen hero at heart, but thanks to the movie&#039;s animation, his more modern, funnier dialogue and overall more playful personality, he has a roguish charisma that was completely lacking in the original incarnation of the character, which is infamous to Latin American fans for being extremely annoying. This alone is already a HUGE benefit to the movie, because you don&#039;t actually want to see Seiya get beat up all the time, and you don&#039;t mind it when he has bullshit shounen power ups and wins because he is actually likable.<br />
<br />
 Tatsumi was completely reinvented from a thuggish bald kendo expert into a fatherly, bumbling butler figure completely overwhelmed and scared at the over-the-top happenings around him but determined to protect Saori at any cost. This makes the character much more grounded and much more sympathetic compared to the original incarnation which was mostly a giant douche.<br />
<br />
 Saori herself might be the movie&#039;s biggest and most noticeable change: she acts MUCH more realistically in this movie compared to the original series. Here she is a confused, scared teenage girl who acts very much like someone whose life was turned around completely in just one day, but still cares for and tries to help the Saints in whatever way she can, unlike in the original series where she was this aloof, bigger-than-life mary sue who did not at all feel like a teenage girl. Another notable difference is that she isn&#039;t sleeping for the entire arc, she actually goes with the Saints into the Sanctuary and is conscious during the whole thing; while she doesn&#039;t do much besides use her cosmo to heal wounds, it already makes her feel like a much more active character than the original.  It might also be worth noting that Seiya and Saori are both 16 in this movie, which is more believable compared to the original where they were both 13.<br />
<br />
The movie has similar re-inventions for other characters, such as making Deathmask a complete insane showboat with an oogie-boogie esque lair and short musical number, making Milo into a WOMAN (so the gold saints aren&#039;t a complete sausage fest), turning Shiryu into the Comically Serious, etc. Pretty much all of these changes are either not worse than the original, or better.  <br />
<br />
So the problem is actually a bit different than you would expect; the bits of characterization we DO see, the interactions between the different characters (like when shiryu is individually naming all the houses and the other 3 saints just ignore him and continue on), are so much better and feel so much more HUMAN than the previous series even though it&#039;s not that deep, that it just makes you want to see more of that, but the movie can&#039;t afford to do so because of the run time. This and the rushed plot are the main weaknesses of the movie, though in regards to the plot itself there are a couple of things which make a little more sense this time around; Seiya actually has the idea of bypassing straight to the final house, but it&#039;s made clear the Sanctuary is magically bound to prevent that, as Seiya and Saori just get knocked to the next house that the others were headed to anyway.<br />
<br />
 There are also some things which bothered me on the character front, like the fact that Ikki basically does jackshit in this movie. He shows up all of twice and spouts off a few one-liners, but besides looking cool the first time and getting trounced the second, he does nothing of significance, whereas all the other four come out looking much better. he could have honestly not been in this movie and very little would have to be changed.<br />
<br />
However, the rest of the movie is excellent.<br />
<br />
What originally got people&#039;s attention from the trailers was the impressive CGI and visual redesigns of both the characters themselves and their cloths, which look much more mechanical this time around. Let me tell you that the CGI in this movie is some of the absolute best I have seen from Japan, possibly THE most impressive. To say this movie is gorgeous is an understatement. The backgrounds are jaw-droppingly beautiful to look at, and I loved pretty much all the character redesigns, because they made each character much more distinctive (giving facial hair to Aioria, giving mu glasses, aldebaran&#039;s nose ring, making milo a woman, etc). They&#039;re also extremely well-animated themselves; a huge part of Seiya and Saori&#039;s likeablity is the charisma of the former and frailty of the latter that is conveyed through their mannerisms and facial expressions. <br />
<br />
The fight scenes are extremely well-animated as well with amazing coreography and stunning visual moments, unlike in the original show where there was no fancy footwork, just people calling out attacks and standing behind a greenscreen. There&#039;s a HUGE sense of grandeur to the fights, you really feel like this is an over-the-top conflict between larger than life people, almost like Dragon Ball, but in the best possible way.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack to the movie is decent, a few moments stand out and give the movie some pizzazz, though on the whole it&#039;s not the best SS movie soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Overall, this movie is not really a good introduction to SS for newer fans, as it does not really explain things that well and the plot moves along extremely quickly. However if you are already a fan and want to see an amazing re-envisioning with out-of-this-world visuals, much improved characterization (the little there is of it), amazing fight scenes, and decent music, this movie is right up your alley. Even with all of its flaws, it improved on several of the series&#039; original flaws and made it much more engaging for a more hardened fan who is very conscious of the original SS&#039;s shortcomings. Please give this a movie a chance, just take it for what it is.<br />

    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I saw this movie thinking &#039;they will summarize the old serie&#039;, but it was another story. I say another story because I was waiting for some parts of the old serie that do not apply to this movie. The 5 characters in this movie had the personality changed a little bit. How believes that Shun didn&#039;t ask for the help of Ikki once! The background of the scenes were very good and I believe they in some scenes used real scenario (hahaha... yes, I&#039;m easy to trick... -.-). About the sound I prefer say nothing because it&#039;s not my field.  The enjoyment of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160339">
        the movie is very good. Although they are fight, we have some points with some very good jokes.<br />
<br />
Well my overall note is 9 if you do not expect the same line of story of the old serie. Also, Atena speeches make my almost cry. Another stuff, after the crediting part has a surprise...<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
This movie was meant to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Franchise. The movie&#039;s plot was a retelling of the sanctuary arc which in the anime was 72 or 73 episode while this was 95 minutes so the everything went by fast. It also changed a lot of things that were in the classic manga and anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of these changes I didn&#039;t mind but some were bothersome. I didn&#039;t mind that the Bronze Saints ages were increased to 16 and 18 because in the original they didn&#039;t act their age. What bothered me the most was that Milo was gender flipped and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193667">
        I don&#039;t know why they did that I heard there was joke between the staff. I know he didn&#039;t have a lot of development in the anime and manga but majority of the characters in the original series did not have a lot of development. <br />
<br />
I liked the graphics and sound those were both really good. <br />
<br />
The characters didn&#039;t do much for me the only character changes I notice were Shiryu who is a goofball know it all, Deathmask who has turned into a Disney character, Saori who is still a damsel in distress but not rude at all and Shun which is probably the few character changes I liked since he is not relying on his brother majority of the time. <br />
<br />
The setting I didn&#039;t like they changed the sanctuary into something that came out of a sci-fi movie and the outfits, why on earth are they wearing masks this seemed like Saint Seiya power rangers. I don&#039;t get why Saga turned into a boss from a Final Fantasy video game.<br />
 <br />
The plot wasn&#039;t that good because they took something that was 73 episodes and made it into a movie which means that the skip a lot of things or made a battle very quick. They took out a good fight scene between Ikki and Shaka out and the battle between Hyoga and Camus lasted maybe 5 seconds. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know whose I idea it was to make this movie but the idea was terrible I mean the graphics were good but if you don&#039;t have a good plot then you won&#039;t have a successful movie and that is just what happened the movie didn&#039;t even make a profit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    This reimagining of the first arc of Seint Seiya is aestethically pleasing, but lacking substance.<br />
<br />
Visually it definitely has impact. The sound department is also good, although the music is uninspiring and it didn&#039;t leave any impression or memory after viewing the movie.<br />
<br />
Story and character wise, that&#039;s where this film is lacking. They try to fit the original story in one hour and a half, and the results are appalling. The ending is nonsensical.<br />
What&#039;s worse is that while it might be disappointing for a fan of the series - unless you are just into it for sake of seeing fancy armored people beating each other out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244292">
        - I&#039;m under the impression that this movie would suck even more for people who haven&#039;t seen the original series.<br />
A few reasons:<br />
- references made to characters that don&#039;t even appear on screen<br />
- facts slightly mentioned that a viewer would expect to be explored a bit more (example: Aiolia being brother to Aiolos)<br />
- dialogue lines that require knowledge of stuff not even mentioned in the movie to be understood<br />
- Ikki (seriously, if you don&#039;t know him, does it make any sense in this movie?)<br />
- because of the whole thing being rushed, characters are just shallow and do not convey any emotion.<br />
I think that if you don&#039;t know the previous material the movie is just going to be a lot of fancy cgi with a really basic and at times incomprehensible story patched to it.

    This movie is a travesty. I&#039;ll admit the shiny CG had me excited, it looked like the fights would be amazing, and they were pretty cool indeed, but that needed up being the only good thing about this movie. <br />
<br />
The first sin is the butchering of characters. Seiya is not Seiya. In the original series, he acts like a chill guy who just has no interest in this Athena stuff and outright dislikes Saori until changing his attitude and commiting to protect her. Now, I understand that obviously there isn&#039;t enough time for this whole arc in the movie, but they could have had him

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323993">
        act his normal self. What did they do instead? Turned him into way too talkative of a person who has wacky awkward moments with girls, because now we&#039;re moving onto sin number 2. (I don&#039;t care enough to complain about the other characters because honestly they&#039;re not developed enough).<br />
<br />
The second son is the god awful comedy. It&#039;s already bad enough, but makes it worse when it takes you out of the experience. I mean for God&#039;s sake, there&#039;s a musical number in the movie. And all this time and resources could have been used to better develop the plot since it&#039;s already hampered from having to be squeezed into such little time.<br />
<br />
The third sin is just random stupid bullshit. A Final Fantasy type end boss, shitty and pointless redesigns, a Gold Saint being killed off 10 seconds after their introduction because as I said, resources went into musical numbers, a centaur form...it&#039;s just all so tiresome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some positives: as I said, the action can be really cool. The majority of the Cloth redesigns look spectacular, and the others, while not looking bad exactly, just aren&#039;t AS good. Some of the characters look amazing in this CG, while the rest look horrible, not because of the CG, but because of the redesign.<br />
<br />
As I said with the Netflix series: don&#039;t bother, just do yourself a favor and watch the original show. If you can, try as hard as possible to the Zera-subs version.

    From the trailer, the expectations towards this film were very high. A reboot of the 12 houses (one of the most popular sagas), with a crazy CG graphic. Potentially, it could have been a masterpiece. In practice, it was a failure.<br />
<br />
The main problem was the development of the stories, in tight and badly managed times, as well as to some &quot;narrative choices&quot; for certain characters, which ruined them.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 3<br />
<br />
With some differences, and a totally new and modern style, the story was already famous. Saori Kido, reincarnation of Athena, the 5 classic bronzes, and the saga of 12 houses, against the impostor pope, Gemini Saga.<br />
<br />
The problem:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307707">
        development and times.<br />
<br />
The focus of the film had to be the 12 houses, those epic battles, re-proposed here. Obviously, since the saga of the anime lasted 30 episodes, it wasn&#039;t possible to make us all fit into a movie, but it wasn&#039;t even acceptable to manage the 12 houses in about 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Yes, the first half hour of the film was set up as an introduction. The clashes of the 12 houses were managed in about another half hour, quickly and with little emphasis, some put off-panel, or wasting time with horrible gags (Aldebaran and Deathmask). The rest, for the final part, a horrible thing (albeit having a quote from the original manga and one from The Lost Canvas).<br />
<br />
They had to devote more space to the battles at the 12 houses, that was the problem. The solutions were either to decrease the introduction, or a half hour more of films, managing the clashes adequately, would have been very useful.<br />
<br />
Disappointment.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 10<br />
<br />
Although I didn&#039;t like all of the character designs, the graphic level is very high, the same for animations.<br />
<br />
https://yamishikimoon.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/tumblr_ngnvwillz91qfkbfbo1_400.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 7<br />
<br />
Normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 5<br />
<br />
There are some characters that have &quot;improved&quot; in some way, many normal, others really made ridiculous. But the general problem is always the short time.<br />
<br />
For the protagonists not much changes, if not the addition of superfluous gags (more for Seiya and Shiryu). Saori, on the other hand, is a different girl, more active and better than the original.<br />
<br />
The Gold Saints are more troublesome. I say:<br />
- Mu is ok<br />
- Aldebaran is a glutton<br />
- Deathmask is HORRIBLE (his song piece, one of the worst things)<br />
- Aiolia is insipid (and his fight goes off-panel)<br />
- Shaka is better in a certain sense (in the original, he was an arrogant and blind to the truth, here is the opposite), but has no space<br />
- Dohko does not appear<br />
- Milo is a woman, but a great fighter (I like her)<br />
- Aiolos appears little, but is better than the original, a true hero<br />
- even Shura is better than the original, both as a warrior and because he uses the brain<br />
- Camus is... I don&#039;t know what he is here...<br />
- Aphrodite, treated in the most unworthy manner<br />
- and finally, Saga... he has only the evil personality, until the clash with Seiya he is a good character, but in the end he is completely ruined<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT. 6<br />
<br />
Great expectations, a lot of potential, unfortunately wasted, by bad management in too short a time. A shame.<br />
<br />
The most noteworthy thing is high-level animation.

    So much undeserved hate... Several of my friends loathed this movie because &quot;this is not the Saint Seiya of my youth&quot;. So what? If people want so badly the original, just go buy the DVD and rewatch it ad nauseam.<br />
This re-creation of the story is healthy, the CGI is gorgeous. There are precious moments, since the first scenes of the space battle with Aiolos carrying the baby Saori, and the first apparition of Aiolia with all the electric tension in the air. Death Mask as a buffoon and Milo as a woman alienated lots of hardcore fans, but I think they were great adaptations.<br />
Too bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372578">
        that there was too much material to be covered in a single movie compared to the dozens of hours in the original anime series. It is just impossible to squeeze that much information, resulting that the movie works better for those who are already familiar with the story, who paradoxically mostly hated the movie for not being a clone.
