    Ah, Akihabara. Otaku center of the world. Filled to the brim with anime, manga, video games, computer goods, maid cafés, and vampires. <br />
<br />
Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation feels like a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Is it a masterful work of writing? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it enjoyable? I&#039;d like to think so. Isn&#039;t that why we watch anime? To enjoy ourselves?<br />
<br />
The premise is quite simple. Akiba has been overrun by vampires known as &quot;Bugged Ones&quot; and the only way to defeat them is to strip them of their clothes and expose them to sunlight. Depending

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243907">
        on your tolerance for fan service there&#039;s your indication as to whether or not you should bother starting the show. However, for those coming in because they&#039;re thinking the show will have the same amount of fan service as Prison School for example, you&#039;ll be disappointed as the fan service is quite minimal considering the premise of the show.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s strongest asset in my eyes is how much heart it feels went into the show. As previously mentioned the show is a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Computers, card games, audiophiles, Street Fighter, wrestling, and more. Every episode is an affectionate parody of these subcultures and is both the show&#039;s biggest strength and weakness. If you&#039;re familiar with what they happen to be parodying that episode you will enjoy yourself immensely, but if not, you might feel like you&#039;re being left out of the joke. This results in each episode being quite hit or miss. Not every episode will be a hit, but when they are, my God do they hit.<br />
<br />
This love and passion for these interests leads to a payoff when it comes to the show&#039;s comedy. The accuracy of the wrestling tropes. A person&#039;s descent into becoming an audiophile. How a card game looks for people who know what&#039;s going on vs people who don&#039;t know a thing about the game. They know what will make people who enjoy these interests laugh and they make good use of that knowledge. The show knows how stupid it is and revels in by going completely over the top whenever possible. It&#039;s not afraid to poke fun at itself either by occasionally referencing various characteristics of the show itself. It&#039;s all comedic gold.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t particularly complex and developed, but would you expect anything different? That&#039;s not to say they’re walking tropes however. Tamotsu escapes being a bland nerd MC and Arisa shows off her loyalty when faced with an important decision. It&#039;s not much, but it&#039;s something. But frankly in a show like this the development and complexity of the characters isn&#039;t important. What is important however is how likable they are. The group is full of energy and enthusiasm when the times are good, and when push comes to shove they&#039;ll go out of their way to show how much they care about each other.<br />
<br />
Could I talk about the art or the sound? Sure, probably. But frankly they&#039;re not remarkably good or bad enough to justifying writing about and I don&#039;t see a point in telling you something is completely average just for the sake of padding out the amount of words in this review.<br />
<br />
For me Akiba&#039;s Trip has been the surprise of the season and was a complete joy to watch. The show knew what it wanted to achieve and passed with flying colours. It&#039;s goofy, it&#039;s fun, it&#039;s energetic, it&#039;s hilarious, it&#039;s Akiba&#039;s Trip.

    The beautiful thing about comedy is that it&#039;s subjective.  It&#039;s an extremely wide topic where there&#039;re a multitude of ways to go about it, with the main goal being getting those watching or listening to laugh at the end.  So, how does one go about making the ridiculous plot of stripping off peoples&#039; clothes entertaining?  Well, by shoving in references of course.<br />
<br />
Story: Akihabara, the place of hopes and dreams is threatened by an unseen threat.  Bugged ones, creatures who lurk in the dark, seek to take over the otaku capital and rule over it by their own laws and values. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243977">
        In order to beat them, one must expose the people they inhabit to light.  Which means, strip the person to their undergarments.  But never fear, the team consisting of three teenagers and a middle schooler known as Electric Mayonnaise is here!  Oh god, we&#039;re still screwed aren&#039;t we?<br />
<br />
Based on a game series with the same name, Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation takes the gameplay elements of fighting the enemies by stripping them in the Akihabara setting and nothing else.  The entire series is made with completely new characters and features a storyline entirely of one-off episodic adventures that each feature a theme pertaining to either one part of Otaku culture with varying degrees of comedic success.  Each episode acts like its own zany and wacky adventure where the characters always end up fighting a Bugged One as the episode&#039;s &quot;Final Boss&quot; before returning back to their normal lives and back to the status quo of the series.  <br />
<br />
Comedy comes in the form of exaggeration and quickly timed jokes that snap in and out as fast as they come.  Due to the show&#039;s fast-paced nature, the show never sits on one joke for too long, and keeps going along with the series&#039;s momentum to make sure keep the audience engaged to the end.  Though the jokes can be hit or miss both depending on what you&#039;re a fan of (since they cover quite a wide variety of topics), and due to how blunt and not subtle everything is, the show is very consistent on how it wants to do things and doesn&#039;t falter on what it wants to deliver.  <br />
<br />
And that&#039;s...all there is.  Packed full of references (both real world and from other series&#039;), Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation is quite simply a sporadic episodic story that uses the exact same storyline for each episode with the only variation being how the story is set up, what each episode&#039;s theme is, and what kind of boss they&#039;re fighting in the end.  There honestly isn&#039;t much to say.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Episodic storyline (depends on your taste)<br />
+/- Blunt, fast-paced comedy (depends on your taste)<br />
<br />
Characters: Development is very slim for the characters in Akiba&#039;s Strip, as the fast-paced comedic nature of the series makes it very difficult for any meaningful development to happen to any of its characters.<br />
<br />
Electric Mayonnaise, the titular group of the series, consists of 3 (technically 5?) members.  Mayonaka Matome is a Bugged One who fights to save Akihabara from those that want to take the district for themselves, Tamotsu Denkigai is an otaku turned Bugged One who&#039;s more than happy to defend Akihabara and save it from potential doom, and Ahokainen Arisa is a blonde foreigner who&#039;s basically a Mary Sue, capable of doing...almost everything (somehow) while cosplaying at every chance she has.  In short, what you see is what you get, as their characters barely change throughout the entire series.  If anything, you get to learn more about their personalities and what they&#039;ve done, but beyond that, there&#039;s nothing much to say.  The other two characters that are technically part of Electric Mayonnaise are Denkigai Niwaka, Tamotsu&#039;s little sister, and the professor, who&#039;s this tiny girl with a large labcoat on a segeway.  Likewise, what you see is what you get, and like the main trio, are characters that barely change in the series.<br />
<br />
The Bugged Ones that act as villains in the series are quite simple.  They all want to take over Akihabara in some strange yet convoluted manner.  They act more like the episode&#039;s final boss that our main characters must fight at the episode&#039;s climax more than anything, and have very little beyond their characters beyond their motivation to rule Akiba.  <br />
<br />
There&#039;re quite a number of side characters in this show, spanning shokeepers in Akiba, to random characters that get featured in the series once or twice that all add one or two things to the series, culminating to the spastic feel that is this show.  They&#039;re not really all that important, but they help spice what&#039;s already there.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Defined, entertaining characters<br />
-  Entire cast is one note<br />
<br />
Art: Produced by Gonzo, Akiba&#039;s Trip boasts a colorful, erratic, and wild artsyle that further compliments the comedy of the series.  Everything from the characters&#039; movements to the the backgrounds and settings is done in a distracting yet entertaining way that compliments the fast paced nature of the series.  Though the show isn&#039;t always consistent in this manner.  The background audience for a large majority of the scenes are white figures with smiley faces rather than handdrawn characters, so in this regard, while it fits to the outlandish nature that this show boasts, has hit or miss qualities.  <br />
<br />
Fanservice is actually quite common in this show, which isn&#039;t very surprising when the show is about stripping people naked to save a district in Japan.  Though they&#039;re blatant with it, fanservice doesn&#039;t actually come all that often, and when it&#039;s done, it&#039;s not so overglorified that it detracts from the show, though that does happen on occasion.  <br />
<br />
What I think where the art really exceeds expectations is in some of the real life references that they were able to execute in this show.  First off, they got real life sponsors to make cameos.  Not only that, but in one episode, they were able to get real footage from Street Fighter V of all things in their show.  Now these might not be too difficult to obtain, but the fact that the show was able to get some stuff from real life into the show was in my eyes, pretty cool, especially since most anime that do something like this make their own parody versions to avoid copyright and other legal problems.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Colorful and crazy art to fit the show<br />
+ They legit got Capcom to let them use Street Fighter footage in an episode<br />
-  Laziness in some aspects of the art<br />
<br />
Sound: As far as sound goes, Akiba&#039;s Trip&#039;s OP has a high energy beat reflective of that to the series it comes from.  Complete with idol singing and a clear fast beat, the OP is, while isn&#039;t all that memorable when not put on repeat, is a nice, fast song to listen to.  EDs in Akiba&#039;s Trip vary, as roughly each episode has its own ED with the main draw of all of them being the fact that they&#039;re all idol songs.  Similarly, not as memorable as they could be, but still nice listens.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: If you ask me, I&#039;ll tell you that Akiba&#039;s Trip is a stupid, pointless show that has no value aside from being brainless entertainment.  And that&#039;s precisely why I love it.  The show to an extent is self-aware of its own merits and it owns up to them, enhancing its dumb and energetic self to create a fun to watch show that despite not being serious in the slightest, can still be enjoyable.  I liked it, and more important than anything, I enjoyed and had fun with it.<br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
Oh far too much.  The fact that the show was self-aware of its own stupidity made it that much easier to enjoy its random episodes.  In particular, the episode where they talk about card games (I think it was episode 8) was the episode that resonated with me the most.  Not only that, but I like Mayonaka as a character.  <br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
Honestly, there wasn&#039;t really much to hate for me.  I wouldn&#039;t call this one of my favorite series, but I had so much fun watching this show that I really had no reason to dislike it at all for any reason.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this anime?<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re into stupid, brainless, and sporadic comedy shows like me, then Akiba Strip is a pretty good pick.  Its episodic nature and completely non-serious demeanor makes this show a fun venture to watch.  Though same with all comedy, it is subjective to a specific audience, so if you&#039;re not a fan of in your face humor, then this is probably not the show for you.

    [This is my first review, so if you see grammar mistakes or typos, please bear with me]<br />
<br />
Akiba&#039;s Trip is an anime based of a game about stripping. I don&#039;t know about the game tho, but the anime is good enough to make me kept watching &#039;til the end. It&#039;s a bit early for me to review this (since there&#039;s only 4 episodes out at the time I&#039;m writing this) but since another users have reviewed this, yea.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
Very dumb. In Akiba, there&#039;s something called Bugged Ones who possess people living around there to make them evil. To make them back to their &quot;previous&quot; side, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239109">
        main heroes Tamotsu (not Mokkun from Boku no Pico, lol) and the red-haired girl should undress them. Then Tamotsu got interested for something like idols (ep 3) and radios (ep 4). He even managed to buy everything related to it, with a really high price. Because of his interest, he got to met some Bugged Ones. (like in the pool of ep 3)<br />
<br />
Pretty dumb, right? Since almost every Bugged Ones are girl, you know what&#039;s going to happen.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
<br />
I really liked the colors and the character design. The animation is ok, it goes well with the budget. <br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
<br />
The OP, ED, and the OST were forgettable. I can&#039;t even remember a single bit of the OP. The voice acting is nice tho.<br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
Forgettable cast. I only remember Tamotsu because his name sounds like Mokkun from BnP, the rest were forgettable. There is a fanservice generator (the yellow-haired girl), Tamotsu&#039;s sister, and a red-haired girl who managed to kiss Tamotsu. Also, a professor with a really long name. After writing that, I realized that&#039;s a pretty generic cast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
Because I don&#039;t mind the ecchi part, I really enjoyed this. For those who hate ecchi, you wouldn&#039;t enjoyed this to it&#039;s maximum.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10<br />
<br />
Pass if you hate fanservice/ecchi, watch if you dont care and need your daily dose of another ecchi comedy.

    If you know the game that this anime is based on you&#039;d expect it to be fanservice city.Well let me warn you, it&#039;s not. There is some fanservice here and there and it can be quite nice but this show does not live and die off of fanservice. It actually lives and breathes off of comedy. And it is really good at it.<br />
<br />
The comedy of Akiba&#039;s Trip is specialized and really out there. They don&#039;t settle with just making a job plain they really go all the way out there and really proclaim it. The fiendish plans range from silly but plausible to WTF HOW

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243947">
        DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK!? And it works because each plan is more stupid than the last until it gets to the point of just HOWWW. Everything is exaggerated in this show. The farther into each episode the more exaggerated it gets. It&#039;s great to see all the twists and turns that they throw in. Not only do they throw in great exaggerations but they also model it to fit into the realm of okatuness that they are covering for the episode. This acts as a celebration of okatu culture which is a novel idea. Furthermore, it does so in unique and fun ways only adding to the joy of each episode. <br />
<br />
Aiding the comedy is a great cast of characters. Each one of them feels refreshing and interesting in their own rights. Tomatsu is not the typical self-insert bland MC. He&#039;s super dedicated to one thing at a time, and with push himself to do the best at that one task, showing an unusual amount of drive. He&#039;s also a complete hipster. His cell phone looks dated. He&#039;s always looking up alternative methods to do the okatu habits that he enjoys rather than sticking to the tried and true. This makes him that much more interesting as a character.<br />
<br />
His little sister Niwaka is also great. It&#039;s clear that she loves Tomatsu as a sibling but it never goes beyond that. She wants him but she doesn&#039;t cling to him, nor is what she does defined by him. She also hangs out more with the other girls that surround Tomatsu as well. Even if she has some of the imouto traits, she&#039;s refreshing as she&#039;s honest and doesn&#039;t define herself only by her onii-chan, rather she feels like a real sister who does care for her brother. (She&#039;s also not annoying and she doesn&#039;t try to push him into things, she&#039;s a pretty cool person.)<br />
<br />
Mayo and Arisa are also both great characters. They all have likeable charm to them even though Mayo does stay in the tsundere character. (Although she does grow warmer over the span of the show.) Overall the characters all have their own likeable charms while still sticking to a general role. While they aren&#039;t the most developed they are refreshing and fun and thusly enjoyable. <br />
<br />
I&#039;d argue the plot is pretty cool too. The general plot leaves open a hype ending as well as provides the context for the fun of the episodic nature of the show. The comedy is enhanced by the episodic nature because they can keep on making things more extreme which each episode, using the same formula and providing twists to keep it fun. All it all it creates a nice structure for the show to work with, which helps its success.<br />
<br />
It also happens to have some nice sorta unexpected development which I quite enjoyed. <br />
<br />
The animation I feel like it pretty strong and the art can be quite humorous. Some of the character designs are really well done while others are quite funny in their simplicity. It&#039;s enjoyable to see the wide range of character designs they have from cool to cute, to silly simple. The music is also pretty good too. I wouldn&#039;t call the OST great but there are some nice memorable tracks which help the show out.<br />
<br />
All and all it&#039;s a great show with the ability to provide refreshing characters, a nice plot and development and most importantly a lot of good comedy. And it provides all of this while also giving a supporting message to Okatu culture. A message that we shouldn&#039;t judge others for what we do because we&#039;re all working off our passion and that&#039;s great. I&#039;d recommend it if you&#039;d like a fun and silly show. It&#039;s quite a good one. <br />

    Akiba&#039;s Trip is based &quot;loosely&quot; off of the video game series of the same name, as in it shares the same concept, but no characters, story, etc.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s admittedly a train wreck. The characters are all extremely one note stereotypes, the story is messy and constantly throwing itself around in crazy places.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t understand who this was for. For the fans of the games, it was a letdown to have it bear hardly any resemblance at all.<br />
<br />
For fresh viewers who hadn&#039;t heard of the game franchise prior, they should be disappointed by its shallow fanservice, constant misdirection, and mediocre characterization. <br />
<br />
At least some of the visual

    So I&#039;ve now seen the show (no shit I&#039;m reviewing it) and as much as i wanted to like this show i couldn&#039;t i wanted the Akiba&#039;s trip Anime to be the echii i was looking for this season as a fan of the game and echii in general i was disappointed anyway lets get on with it. side note i know someone who has rated this anime low and got loads of fanboys telling him stuff about it well i have some news i didn&#039;t like the anime and I&#039;m not great at reviews get over it.<br />
<br />
Story 1/10<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll never guess what its about striping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243887">
        this whole show is about striping STRIPING if this show was highschool DXD level good or Legend of the Galactic Heroes good i would be all for it but its just trying to make up for the lack of story with fan service and I&#039;m not gonna say its all bad fan service but its just shameless.<br />
<br />
Art 2/10<br />
<br />
art was one of the few things this show had going for it but yet they messed that up one of my favourite characters in the show mayo had one of the better character designs but it still wasn&#039;t good at all lets take the so called king of Akikba in the show just....just go google him nuff said.<br />
<br />
Sound 4/10<br />
<br />
Sound was where this show excelled not to say its good not to say its bad but the overwhelming amount of bad in this show  makes the 4 pretty much useless.<br />

The Show Revolves around  4 Main Charterers with other ones returning on the side These being  a stereotype Otaku,Generic hungry Anime Girl, Big Breasted Blond Haired European and Incest is wincest little sister. if you had just put a Shark out of water flopping about on camera it would be a massive improvement.<br />

    Do you remember that feeling of watching a cartoon as a child? Would you ever want to feel like that again? If the answer is yes, then here you go, this is it but with boobs, asses and even DICKS!<br />
*Disclaimer: Don&#039;t expect to see any of that though, it&#039;s all censored of course. <br />
The concept like that has been seen before of course, this is not anything new, but mix that with the intent of showcasing any type of phase that exists in the world and you may just find a winner for some of us in the anime community. With that being said, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243905">
        present you with Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation, based on the somewhat popular series of games, this is probably the most explosive and bombastic anime of Winter 2017.<br />
<br />
The whole idea of Akiba&#039;s Trip is not one that I would call simple. Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka go to Akihabara, which just like in our world is a place full of otaku merchandise, anime, manga, maid cafes and such. In one of the shops with exclusive goods he meets Arisa, a busty girl from Finland and they quickly bond over figurines. Later he also runs into Mayonaka who is a part of defense group that protects the place from incidents, but it turns out there&#039;s more to it. Monsters invade Akiba and as Tamotsu rushes to save his sister he gets tangled up in the war between the two groups. He receives special powers that end up trapping him. Without much choice he becomes the protector Akiba deserved and desperately needed.<br />
Some of you may see this as a generic plot, but you forgot one part of it all- the title. Sure, you could just read it as a trip to Akiba, but if you could just take that s and put it next to the second word, you&#039;ll understand that this anime is going to offer more than just the plot. It&#039;s gonna offer all the &quot;plots&quot;, if you know what I&#039;m saying *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*<br />
Ekhm... sorry about that.<br />
The way that the Bugged Ones - the previously mentioned monsters that disguise themselves as humans - are defeated, is by stripping them down completely. You can expect a lot of character fanservice in here, all damage is done through ripping off clothes so that&#039;s kinda obvious, but I feel like it&#039;s a very important part of all the craziness that it tries to portray.<br />
Speaking of the craziness, the most important part of it is the format of the show. It&#039;s like an episodic &quot;adventure&quot; type of a show with the last couple of episodes trying to create an ending for a season. It&#039;s something that I immediately connect with the cartoons that I watched when I was younger, kinda like Teen Titans or Ben 10. Putting this into an anime isn&#039;t anything new, far from it. It&#039;s been used a lot, but not in the way that those previously mentioned shows do. Akiba&#039;s Trip embraces itself entirely. It knows it&#039;s a trashy show and it should only concentrate on fun, possibly leaving some space for an arc at the end of it. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a justification of how the show lacks serious progression through over half of its runtime or how every story has to end in one episodes, it&#039;s just my way of experiencing the show and seeing it for what it is rather than as something it clearly never aimed for. This show doesn&#039;t try to be serious, even if may seem like it does, it always plays it for the laughs in the end. It&#039;s self-aware, knows who it panders to, often touches on the topic of who are otakus and knows its limits. I really appreciate how this series handles the topics of unity and the otaku culture. It&#039;s actually beautiful. Still, this leaves the viewer with the question: Is that enough?<br />
Now the answer will depend on the content of the episodes, so let&#039;s talk about that. As I mentioned, Akiba&#039;s Trip indulges itself in its trashiness. It makes the best decision it possibly could have made: it creates episodes for all the nerds out there.<br />
You watch wrestling? There&#039;s an episode about wrestling.<br />
You watch gaming tournaments? There&#039;s an episode about a gaming tournament.<br />
You watch porn? There&#039;s an episode about porn.<br />
Yes, I&#039;m serious.<br />
While the first episode is only a poor exposition, because it gives the impression of it being just an ecchi show, everything past that is pure madness. It doesn&#039;t have only one thing it uses, it has multiple ones that it completely overblows. And that&#039;s fun! Yes, it&#039;s the same formula over and over, the team meets someone who later turns out to be a Bugged One that they defeat by stripping him/her, but it manages to keep it fresh. You may think that its episodic nature will ruin the feeling of continuity or that the lack of connection could just turn it into a boring show that only has cool moments. Worry not, the cast is here to help.<br />
<br />
The characters are just as ridiculous and fickle as the plot. Tamotsu jumps from being a hipster to being a normie to being a mainstream fag at any convenient point. It&#039;s not because he is written poorly, but because he lives in freaking Akiba. You can find everything there, and so he tries all of it out one by one. You can say that he has an attention span of a dog. He&#039;s honestly a great main character for the series, easily relatable and constantly changing to be compatible with the current topic. Haven&#039;t you ever went through a phase in your life? That chunk of your precious time that you spent on only one type of entertainment over a certain period of your existence, like wrestling, gaming and such. Tamotsu is the embodiment of that, it&#039;s just because of the situation he found himself in, he changes his interests more often.<br />
The only character that could come close to  Tamotsu in terms of sudden changing is Arisa Ahokainen. She traveled all over the world and experienced many different things, but decided to roll with the squad in Akiba. This busty blonde from Finland is more of a companion than anything else, but she does have several unique features. She cosplays at all times, changing her clothes multiple times throughout an episode, her voice is very high pitched and her energy is endless.<br />
The other two group members are Mayonaka, who&#039;s just a tomboy with a baseball bat, and Niwaka, who ends up being a damsel in distress a bit too much. There&#039;s seriously not much to say about them, though their characters do progress and become more likable as time goes on.<br />
The main cast works really well off of each other, for example Tamotsu&#039;s and Arisa&#039;s clumsiness contrasts with Mayo&#039;s sense of duty. It&#039;s used in a pretty simple way: When a specific reaction seems to be the best one, the characters that can pull that expression off step up to the spotlight. It works rather well and gives off a feeling of good character rotation and solid comedic timing.<br />
The minor characters and the episodic ones are a bit stretched out, but they are mostly pushed to the sidelines to let the main cast take the center stage. They&#039;re rather forgettable, but I think that&#039;s mostly because of the fact that they&#039;re quickly replaced and the show doesn&#039;t stop to let you drill them into your memory. Overall though, the cast does a solid job at making me want to see their misadventures continue.<br />
<br />
Now for the more technical aspects, this show is fair. Some of you who only saw the first three episodes may look at this and think &quot;This guy&#039;s an idiot&quot; and well.... you may be somewhat right. Akiba&#039;s Trip looks flat out ugly at some moments. Some movement, especially during a couple of action scenes, feel like characters are actually blobs, certain camera angles make them look like abominations and overall the art style looks silly. Everything I just mentioned I was able to spot within the first two episodes, however, this series did grow on me. The color pallet is probably as good as it could be, even if blue dominates it, there are so many contrasting elements that each scene is pleasing to the eye. The animation gets more exciting and sudden, which is a good thing. Action scenes include several strong sakuga moments, even if a bit short. All that really fits with the chaotic and explosive feeling the plot and characters give off. That&#039;s not to say it isn&#039;t flawed past the first episodes. The character designs are a bit too normal at times or way too out there at others (the main cast is designed very well though) and the CGI crowds tend to break the immersion. The music also works in the series&#039; favor, actually, it&#039;s probably one of the best parts of the anime. It&#039;s consistently good and fitting and has several good themes that I would gladly listen to on their own. I would assume it comes from the games, which could explain why the quality of the tracks is so good.<br />
<br />
The OP is rather simple, you probably heard similar ones, but it&#039;s catchy, fiery, the music fits the visuals exceptionally well and it made me ready for each episode with the right deal of excitement. It&#039;s solid. The idea for the ED&#039;s is really damn good though. Once again, the action takes place in Akiba, so what better way to end an episode than to showcase some up and coming singers or groups? Each episode has a different song, performed by a different J-Pop artist or an idol group. I can&#039;t say more than one or two stuck in my mind for longer than a second, but nonetheless this idea fits the theme of the series perfectly.<br />
<br />
My relationship with Akiba&#039;s Trip is that of a love-hate one. I can easily say that it was enjoyable as much as it could be. It was able to sell me on its story and characters despite me having extremely negative things to say about it after the first episodes. I am pretty sure this will end up being a disappointed to a lot of viewers. It&#039;s visual style is a big turn-off straight off the bat and the rest of it doesn&#039;t seem promising enough to continue. However, this series does evolve and starts taking clearer direction the more time it gets, especially as a weekly, bombastic series that one could watch after a long day of work or studying, at least it was so for me. It&#039;s definitely not one that works well for binging, but as an episodic one that you can watch every once in a while it may prove to be a surprise hit. With that in mind, I fully recommend Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation. It&#039;s a fun bunch of episodes that may even be considered as longer skits. Comedy can&#039;t appeal to everyone, but when it&#039;s an overblown parody catered to otakus, I&#039;m sure some will find it enjoyable. Expect a lot of fanservice too. That&#039;s how this show rolls, and if you can&#039;t accept that at the start, you won&#039;t get anything out of it.

As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own.

    I gave this anime a chance for several reasons.<br />
<br />
One is that the art style stood out to me.  I liked the colors even just on the picture representing the anime.  Actually I think the art is the best thing about this anime.<br />
<br />
The second is that the premise seemed light and funny despite its ecchi-ness.  I don&#039;t respect fanservice... and naturally the less of it an anime has, the more I respect that anime.  Despite that, it doesn&#039;t turn me off to a show.  I tolerate it and even sometimes enjoy it... like we all do.  (There&#039;s two kinds of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241574">
        people who watch anime: people who occasionally enjoy fanservice and liars).  [That&#039;s a half joke.  Don&#039;t get all triggered on me].<br />
<br />
ANYWAYS<br />
<br />
This anime did something to me that I hate: A tonal shift immediately after the first episode.<br />
<br />
I went into this anime with pretty much 0 expectations, thinking it to be a simple, silly, goofy anime that I could stop watching when I picked my next &#039;good&#039; anime to watch.  The first episode however, despite the comedy, was fairly dark.  Combat was well animated (I think.  Sometimes less is more if you ask me.)  And there was more blood than I expected.  Also more intimacy than I expected with, actually, a fairly decent meeting of lips as far as anime goes.  Even the fanservice had some plot significance.  It all came together and made me interested to see where the story went.<br />
<br />
And then they did nothing with it.  The story has not progressed in 8 episodes, and after teasing me with the tone of the first episode, it immediately became the silly goofy worthless kind of anime that I had expected it to be, each episode becoming harder to get through.  And yes, I binged the 8 episodes (out at the time of this review) in 2 nights, hoping that the tone of the first episode was foreshadowing a darker second half.  Now, seeing as I can&#039;t seem to find an intended episode count anywhere I suppose it could be longer... but my guess is that they&#039;re going for a 10-12 episode anime, which we are quite passed the halfway point of.  That makes me sad.<br />
<br />
I did know, however, that my hope for a dark twist was probably in vain.  As much as the first episode had good interesting &#039;darker&#039; moments, there was a lot of silliness there too.  I probably would have enjoyed the what I&#039;ve seen a little better if I hadn&#039;t raised my expectations.  Emphasis on &#039;probably.&#039;<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, this anime isn&#039;t that good, and it&#039;s not meant to be, and they knew it wasn&#039;t meant to be when they made it, and a part of me respects that, but not enough to give it a good rating.

    Another game turned anime adaptation, this better not have the video game adaptation curse because LA already had enough of shitty video game anime adaptations from 2016!!!...<br />
<br />
&lt;LA after watching it&gt;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s different in it&#039;s own quirky way...<br />
<br />
For it&#039;s introductory episode, Akiba&#039;s Trip does bring us the setting as well as how Electric Mayonnaise gets formed as well as the threat of the Bugged Ones and how to defeat them. After that?, it has an episodic format where a new Bugged One threat appears, Electric Mayonnaise stumbles or is directly influenced by the new fad of Akihabara or Tamotsu Denkigai voiced by Haruki Ishiya&#039;s latest craze to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243961">
        defeat the Bugged Ones. Akiba&#039;s Trip using it&#039;s episodic format looks into the otaku subcultures through this setting, from fighting games, computer parts, card games, anime figures, idols, audiophiles and even pro-wrestling!. How Akiba&#039;s Trip look at these topics are wide ranging from knowing A LOT about it or just wanting to parody it using it&#039;s otaku subcultures as a foundation.<br />
<br />
If there is a flaw to all this is that because of it&#039;s episodic format, the main cast consisting of Tamotsu, Niwaka Denkigai voiced by Marika Kouno, Tamotsu&#039;s little sister, Arisa Ahokainen voiced by Yuki Nagaku a die-hard cosplayer and local tank of Electric Mayonnaise and Matome Mayonaka voiced by Rie Takahashi, the one who introduced Tamotsu and the rest of the cast to the threat of the Bugged Ones and love interest of Tamotsu though she&#039;s incredibly tsundere shy about it. The flaw is that there isn&#039;t much character development to the main cast as it&#039;s more about the episode looking at Tamotsu&#039;s latest craze or otaku subculture fad than it&#039;s character and that&#039;s where Akiba&#039;s Trip lacked heavily (Niwaka being the best example of this as she&#039;s more of a satellite character than anything until she gets focus later on). The defense to all this is that Electric Mayonnaise as a group does develop as a team in fighting the Bugged One of the week only solidifying their teamwork and we learn a bit more about Arisa to Tamotsu and Niwaka&#039;s sibling relationship (no it&#039;s not incest trust LA) to about Matome by the final arc but her a bit later. Even the Bugged Ones themselves are stereotypically hammy evil though there are some red herrings making the REAL Bugged Ones even more lacking and one-hit strip kills at times just to close the episode off. Akiba&#039;s Trip seems more to be focusing on it&#039;s otaku culture in it&#039;s forefront with it&#039;s characters on the background until they need development and LA doesn&#039;t fault the anime that much for that as the main cast DOES get developed somewhat cleverly over the course of the anime. LA&#039;s favourite character was at first Matome then quickly became a tie between Matome and Arisa, but ultimately it went back to Matome.<br />
<br />
If there is one saving grace to Akiba&#039;s Trip to it however, is that the animation is BOMBASTIC even outside it&#039;s &quot;battles&quot;...allowing Gonzo to go all over the place, from purposefully low quality to the reference-crazy detail as hell moments to battles it gets into. LA just loves when Akiba&#039;s Trip and by extension Gonzo going reference and meta-crazy and knowing how self-aware it is which can be another saving grace to Akiba&#039;s Trip.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm...that voice cast seems familiar...ohh right, Marika Kouno, Yuki Nagaku and Rie Takahashi were all from Sore ga Seiyuu!...nice Gonzo bringing up another of your titles, the three even sing the OP and some of the ED&#039;s! *ahem* with it&#039;s voice cast, LA would say that Yuki Nagaku has very unique vocals and was a hoot to hear with her semi-Japanese cadence, Marika Kouno as Niwaka feels like she is projecting Rin Kohana from Sore ga Seiyuu and Rie Takahashi is voicing her typical vocals. Haruki Ishiya sounds very much like he was having a blast voicing Tamotsu and the impressive minor cast voice cast was GREAT to have as well. <br />
<br />
For an anime named Akiba&#039; STrip, the fanservice if anything is surprisingly light, sure there are the expected bra&#039;s and panties and occasional panty shots and the one-strip kill shots, but the anime doesn&#039;t focus on that all due to the meta-self aware nature of Akiba&#039;s Trip directing, the fanservice feels more like an afterthought that trying to deliberately leer at it&#039;s fanservice. <br />
<br />
The &quot;final arc&quot; of Akiba&#039;s Trip if anything does make the anime bit better for those people who wants anime with a bit more of an impactful and cohesive plot and this really puts the Electric Mayonnaise gang to it&#039;s max tension though the &quot;drama&quot; is given more as a detour than any actual drama and give much needed factor towards Matome as a character and her connection to the main villain of the series. A flaw to this is it&#039;s episodic otaku subculture element disappears however it should be noted that the &quot;bigger picture&quot; a la major villain of the anime plotline was touched upon A LOT during the episodic format but nonetheless, even with all these elements of the build up to character development to it&#039;s otaku subculture elements disappearing, the ending still brought back it&#039;s wacky own flavour it had during the episodic format with little details amongst the final arc of the anime and by that LA means that the final episode is essentially a literal FINAL DUNGEON with the BIG BOSS at the end! and it went in a blaze of glory on how the ending was executed and although it had allegories of otaku&#039;s nature and how parents look at them and it still kept it&#039;s bombastic atmosphere by the end of it and LA will praise this kind of ending and how it was handled.<br />
<br />
Akiba&#039;s Trip: The Animation being a very self-aware &quot;Bugged Ones&quot; of the week looking at the subculture of otaku&#039;s makes this video game anime adaptation rather a different breed of adaptation to say the least. It has it&#039;s flaws sure, but it&#039;s bombastic and self-aware nature and the comedy coming from that makes this anime adaptation either a guilty pleasure for LA or a very good self-aware parody anime about otaku subculture...nonetheless Akiba&#039;s Trip: The Animation for LA is an honest to god guilty pleasure for Winter 2017 for LA...flaws and all!

    So why i like that serie?<br />
Because is so classic for me, the story isn´t good and the art and the character are the similiar stereotypes that have other animes.<br />
<br />
The true is really enjoyable, and the classic ecchi, and don´t have more or any thing that make that anime good. Only the enjoyment.<br />
<br />
It´s a classic and a very common but i live it, and i can see that one time per week, serve as relax.<br />
<br />
---Story----<br />
This took about a boy (otaku) that obtein a power that can beat &quot;the bugged one&quot; into akiba, and the lony way to beat them is undress!!<br />
It´s really similar to the game,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241632">
        bot different character<br />
--Character---<br />
Tamutsu is an lively otaku, how meet Matome who is a &quot;bugged one&quot; but don´t like to obtein power to take Akiba.<br />

    This will be my first review, I believe. Normally I wouldn&#039;t bother for a series like this, however I felt it was important to try and point out some of the major issues that many people simply haven&#039;t addressed in reviews thus far.<br />
<br />
First of all, I have seen two major &#039;sides&#039; when it comes to debate on this series. There is the side that argues that it fails on account of being an Akiba&#039;s Trip anime without referring back to the games from which it gets its lineage. Secondly, there&#039;s the camp that argues that the anime fails as a series in a traditional sense,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242535">
        through fault of its characters, overall story and other such things. I&#039;m of the belief that both camps are completely incorrect.<br />
<br />
As far as I&#039;m concerned, Akiba&#039;s Trip is not a traditional anime, nor is it relying on the success of the game franchise it hails from. In fact, I believe that it succeeds for the same reason that the game it hails from succeeded in the first place. This anime is a celebration of otaku culture and Akiba itself. As a result, it casts aside expected conventions of a solid story structure, engaging characters and even its own plot to simply deliver on its purpose of celebrating the electric town of Akihabara.<br />
<br />
How have I gathered this? Well, firstly I&#039;d point to the story structure. While the first episodes do indeed set up a narrative, a villain and a purported structure, the rest of the series proves that it has no intention on following through with this as would be expected. Instead, each episode is almost entirely self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of otaku culture and Akihabara life in general. One episode it may be idols, another it&#039;s military otaku, yet another it&#039;s radio otaku. The focus is not on the characters or the story in these moments. It&#039;s to serve as a grand celebration of the reality it&#039;s taking inspiration from.<br />
<br />
I have been to Akihabara several times and I should emphasize that the enjoyment of this series is magnified many times when you have first-hand experience. Many, if not all of the buildings seen are real buildings. The occurrences within the &#039;plot&#039; are exaggerations of daily life within those buildings and on those streets. In this regard, I&#039;d almost say that this series wasn&#039;t even made for a wider audience. Many of the references and much of the humor seems to be directed specifically at people who frequent Akiba or are at least major otaku themselves. <br />
<br />
The humor is irreverent. Of course it is, why wouldn&#039;t it be? The story is already extremely silly on its most basic foundation, so it only seems natural that the actual gags would be even sillier. The humor is built very solidly on in-jokes that only those within the wider otaku community would be able to appreciate. This furthers my assertion that this series was never intended for a wide audience.<br />
<br />
The art is admittedly rather sub-par. Sometimes improved on by impressive character design and facial expressions, however the solid colour schemes, lack of movement and backgrounds that at times are indisputably just augmented photographs are hard to simply let-slide each and every time. I do however feel that certain elements of this are worth dismissing. As I have stated before, I feel this anime was never created with the intention of reaching a wide audience. I suspect that the budget was very low from the outset and that talented staff members from the studio were likely relegated to different shows. As it stands however, the art and animation is certainly nothing special and at times can be a let-down.<br />
<br />
An aspect in stark contrast is the sound design. The voice actors perform a serviceable job, with some notable exceptions being quite striking and impressive to boot. However the key is the music. Both background music which is at times directly lifted from the games to provide a cheerful and effective mood, as well as the variety of songs used at the end of each episode which I would suspect are likely a method of improving a lackluster budget. In any case, all failures are forgiven in the face of the monotone idol from the idol episode.<br />
<br />
The characters are a mixed bag indeed. The protagonist himself is frankly a delight as a result of how blatant he is in his lack of interest for just about every event of the story. Many episodes occur largely as a result of him indulging in his otaku desires and having them taken to a cartoonish extent. In the context of this show, I find it appropriate. It touches on the mindset of particular otaku communities rather well and at times, it feels as though he himself is a representation of Akihabara. The supporting cast are far more mixed, with segway-loli being hilarious in her very few scenes and miss Moi Moi being a constant barrel of fun with constant costume changes and contrived backstories. The only elements where this feels somewhat hurt is in the other two female leads, who often seem to take too much of a back-seat and lack personality themselves.<br />
<br />
Overall, I found this an extremely enjoyable series, especially in the context of what I believe it was trying to achieve. It&#039;s not a perfect series. Certainly not. If rated against other shows to try and live up to their standards, it would fall flat on many fronts. However if other shows attempted to live up to its specific standards, I can see it quite easily blowing many of them out of the water.<br />
<br />
Not the best series of this season by a long-shot. However in terms of raw enjoyment and appreciation for what it attempted to set out to achieve, I feel it would be doing the series a disservice to rate it below an 8. In its own particular playing field, I feel it knocked it out of the park. Here&#039;s hoping the last few episodes don&#039;t make me eat my words.

    Hey there, this is my first review and I would like to do it to express myself and let people know if this is the kind of anime that you would like to watch.<br />
<br />
First, Akiba&#039;s Trip The Animation is not related to the game&#039;s story, this means that you will not see the main characters of the game and their development along with the story of it but a whole new cast and a new story instead.<br />
<br />
The reason why this anime caught my attention was because of the name of the game, but I was slighty disappointed when I saw that it wasn&#039;t related to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242818">
        it, although I changed my mind after the first episodes and a very specific one (avoiding to spoil) that made me hook up with the anime.<br />
<br />
So lets begin.<br />
<br />
Story: As mentioned before, don&#039;t expect the game&#039;s development here but hey, don&#039;t let appearances fool you, this doesn&#039;t mean that it will automatically become bad or mediocre, the approach of this one is actually more of a parodic style and.. I like it, I&#039;m having fun with it laughing a lot with certain episodes and enjoying the rest of them.<br />
Each episode is pretty much independent, they have their own setup that doesn&#039;t follow a straight line with the plot, kinda like a cartoon so if you&#039;re a viewer that doesn&#039;t like these stuff and want instead something else with a story development I don&#039;t suggest this to you, but if you don&#039;t mind that or you&#039;re interested in it, you&#039;ll have some fun times out there!<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t solid, but the anime can talk by itself with its episodes.<br />
6.4/10<br />
<br />
Art: I like the art, but I think it&#039;s just something fine. There are some aspects of it that I like that are unique used in a comedic way and the character design is good-looking.<br />
6.5/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing much to say here. I like the opening and the seiyuus are good, the sound effects aren&#039;t surprising but they&#039;re fine, no complaints here.<br />
6.5/10<br />
<br />
Character: I personally find the characters here pretty appealing and have their own personalities well-built. You won&#039;t find them flat, generic or lacking something.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This is the strongest point of the anime in my opinion, because <br />
what it really matters is how you interpret something, even if it&#039;s not the greatest thing in the world, you can make it better in your own way. You can enjoy this anime even if it doesn&#039;t have the best story or anything similar as long as it is done well.<br />
<br />
I have been enjoying this anime with each episode.<br />
7.1/10<br />
<br />
Overall: It&#039;s a good anime, not the best one out there but I feel that it&#039;s pretty unique and it defends well by itself, you&#039;ll have fun with the characters and the things they do during the episodes, each episode having a different mini-plot, and plenty of other things.<br />
<br />
And here is the last score<br />
7/10

    It&#039;s pretty bad, but good at the same time. It&#039;s good to be bad, but he does not take himself seriously from the start and it&#039;s clear.<br />
<br />
The anime for many times has no meaning at all, animation is very inconsistent to bad, but it&#039;s very funny, fun, full of references to other anime and games (some really cheeky) and has some (few) great battles.<br />
<br />
The characters have no depth, but this was purposeful, Akiba is very well represented here, which is one of the highlights of the anime and the soundtrack is good.<br />
<br />
I found it ok, the anime fulfilled its role of being unpretentious.<br />
<br />
Ps: Sorry for

    Story: so the story is about tamotsu who is in Akihabara later on he finds out his sister might be in trouble so he goes and looks for her only to find a girl named matome telling him to stay out of it later on a bugged one kills him but matome ends up bringing him back to life but at a cost tamotsu can not leave Akihabara and now cant remove his clothes or he will die, but now he has to fight bugged ones things that posses people but the only way to defeat them is to rip of there clothing so now

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256264">
        tamotsu has to team up with matome and others to defeat them and keep Akihabara safe.<br />
<br />
Art: the art is pretty good for this anime the action parts with it art really detailed in this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: the OP is decent the ED changes after like every episode so i cant really say which one i liked also i watched the dub it was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Character: Tamotsu is the male lead of the anime and he is a Otaku at heart loves getting figures, loves girl bands and just everything anime also when it comes to fighting the guy is a damn good fighter otherwise a cool and nice guy. Matome well she one of the female leads and the original defender of akiba she is a tough chick with Tamotsu and also defending akiba she does get angry a good few times at Tamotsu but that&#039;s it otherwise she a pretty tough but also nice girl. Arisa is another female lead she is a pretty good fighter aswell not a bugged on but she can kick some butt she is also kinda like Tamotsu that he is a Otaku at heart (well maybe not at heart as him but close) otherwise a pretty good and decent character overall. Niwaka is the sister to Tamotsu and the last female lead in the anime honestly she cant really fight or do anything really so there just to help them with other stuff also she does like her brother (not like incest love btw) otherwise a decent character and a nice and kind one at that. Tasujin is a supporting character and is a scientist to the there group Electric mayonnaise she would basically provide stuff on to help them battle the bugged ones a decent character overall.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was here and there it took awhile for the comedy to really get me but later on it was good and the action was damn good for the most part and the characters were all really well done for the most part. Things that i didn&#039;t like: again the comedy to was here and there it really to me AWHILE for it to actually get me to laugh out loud if anything most of the anime was like me smiling also that one of the characters Arisa i felt was kinda here just for the fan service (also sorry for spoiler shes never a bugged one) so yeah and also every time she would say moi or whatever it was she said was kinda annoying i could see people not liking her.<br />
<br />
Overall: it was hard for me to give this a 7 or a 8 or even a 7.5 but in the end i just went with a 8 i think for me the comedy got better for sure as the anime went along and that the action was damn well done and also i loved most of the characters that made this anime really well done i would recommend this anime

    This isn&#039;t an anime good to see if you are looking for a good story that change every episode with plot twist or something like this. This is an anime to see if you want to laugh and spend time. The question is... You can&#039;t take this anime seriously if you want to enjoy it.<br />
I am liking this anime so much because the main character and the blonde one. Tamotsu don&#039;t act like an usual ordinary main character of an ecchi anime.<br />
<br />
And... I think this is it. Sorry for the bad english if I made some mistakes in spelling, and enjoy the anime :)

    First, do not look at my rating/s. It is strictly based on enjoyment. I refuse to be a person who looks for flaws and assumptions only to ruin his enjoyment and memories of shows. And not to mention ruin the chances for others to pick a show just because someone trusted a stranger instead of them self.<br />
<br />
This review&#039;s purpose is to write how I experienced the show, what I remember specifically and what I liked and to spread positivity.<br />
<br />
If your overall experience is great, then changing something will only change the overall feeling. Which is not necessarily guaranteed to be a good thing as some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review244242">
        people might think. Something is what it is and that&#039;s why your overall experience was great. You are lying to yourself if you think you really want something changed.<br />
<br />
- What especially stuck with me during this show is the art, sound and how every factor that makes a show in general was executed during fight scenes. Just like with any show I don&#039;t think you get much grasp of the director&#039;s and the cinematographers (if they have the 2nd in anime development, in any case I mean a person with similar jobs during development) work during common scenes. Since this is a comedy and action you can expect it during action scenes and eventually scenes with an outburst of comedy, such an outburst that rivals movement/action scenes. Meaning that there is enough going on that it can feel like an action (as happenings) scene even without the real action (as action). During those instances you tend to notice directing. It all depends on the individual of course. You all perceive something differently and with more intensity. Worth to note: still scenes (moments) and common scenes aren&#039;t the same.<br />
<br />
During the fight scenes everything moves so smoothly and makes you follow. Whether or not they had innovative animation techniques (I refuse to look back in depth just to nitpick on myself) the fight scenes will most definitely give you the feeling that there&#039;s a lot of creative work done on them. And with the art style we have, the animation during fight scenes is matching. Or rather the art style makes the animation look even better.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have to mention the sound. The opening is one of the best I&#039;ve heard and has a lot of replay value and gives you energy. The ost during the show also did not disappoint. <br />
<br />
The show handles it&#039;s surroundings or backgrounds greatly, as the composition of the scene, the characters involved and the feeling of how said scene continually keeps to get your attention so deep on what actually is the point of the scene, it all is mixed in perfectly to keep your focus on what is intended.<br />
<br />
The usage of colors in the show create the overall and happy feeling. An excellent match for the comedy parts of our characters. The character&#039;s designs are memorable and the color difference even helps them with that. For sure is a certain character the comic relief, char name spoiler inbound, warning you again, I mean our ari even though the show is cheerful anyway. However all the characters are likeable just like that. And the voices are made for them.<br />
<br />
Overall this show gave me everything I love about, well, shows with a happy and sunny vibe. And with my next sentence I also have to mention that it does capture the feeling of a game. (It&#039;s not necessarily an adaption, as It seems the characters are different.) What I mean is it&#039;s noticeable that it works as a game and an anime (and other stuff) so that&#039;s a thumb up.<br />
<br />
I need to get a physical copy of the game sometime.

    Great. I like myself a good Ecchi anime. <br />
<br />
I find it pretty cool and interesting how the anime is set in a modern, colourful society. I also like how the plot has superhuman powers but I feel like the technology used is a bit too unrealistic for the setting. The art is stunningly amazing and the video/animation quality is great, as well as having eye popping colours (and characters, which I&#039;ll explain later).<br />
<br />
I really like how the show starts and has fast paced and peppy songs. I&#039;m kind of into that, but it would be a little better if they had subtitles for the songs.

The character designs are pretty cool, with interesting personalities and colourful hair, as well as a couple of cool and...busty people *Cough, Arisa cough*. The fight scenes are awesome and some are just downright spectacular, with some casual moments to break the ice. <br />
<br />
Overall, this was a pretty great anime. Too bad it only has 1 season. Hoping for another season!  <br />

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
To me this was definitely a hidden and underrated gem of the 2017 winter season because this was one fun and hilarious ride.<br />
<br />
The story focuses on Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka who go to Akiba to enjoy all it&#039;s Otaku brilliance, but they get attacked by creatures called Bugged ones, they run into Matome who is defending Akiba from this threat and also with the help of Arisa they create a team to defend this Otaku paradise from this new monstrous threat.<br />
You gotta love a story when it doesn&#039;t take itself seriously which is what this show does even though it&#039;s about a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249133">
        group of teens defending a section of town from weird monsters I was surprised to see how well this show worked because I can definitely say it was one funny ride because no matter how dangerous the threat got these group of characters never really got serious about it and seeing shows take the usual cliche that you see in a lot of other anime&#039;s and use them as jokes was a delight to see, not only that seeing this group of characters defeat the threat was also really funny like a video game battle, a eating competition and even a card game too. It was also full of references to many other anime&#039;s which was great to see the show make fun of because it worked really well with what was happening in many of the situations that happened in this show.<br />
<br />
The characters were very likeable and funny Tamotsu is pretty much a big Otaku, but he isn&#039;t stupid he actually knows quite a lot of things like at some point his knowledge of electronics actually saved the day plus his none serious and lazy attitude was also really funny and different for once since you don&#039;t really see that many male MC&#039;s with this personality, but when the time called he can be a kind and protective person depending on what the reason is. Matome is a Tsundere that finally is really likeable true she does hit Tamotsu and makes him do patrols for the Bugged ones, but she actually has a fun personality once you get to know her and even at times she wasn&#039;t being serious which shows she can be pretty lose and damn can she eat a lot of food. Arisa is another one of those characters that has the sweet and energetic personality which is always a win for me, but she has a lot of surprises in store like she has a very complex life and is actually very smart plus the funniest aspect of her character is that she always end&#039;s up in a different costume well of course she&#039;s a cosplayer, but the outfit&#039;s she wore sometimes were just hilarious because they seemed so out of place. Niwaka is difficult to decipher mainly because she isn&#039;t in some episodes and can&#039;t fight against the enemies because she doesn&#039;t have powers, but she felt likeable anyway because she didn&#039;t do anything to annoy and there were some scenes that she did something that was actually funny.<br />
The other supporting characters like the Professor who always travelled on her Segway and couldn&#039;t even fit in her lab Coat and the many villains were actually pretty good and it was hilarious seeing how over the top the villains were and how easy they were to defeat was also a funny site too.<br />
<br />
The artstyle felt similar to Kill la Kill not the way the characters were made, but how it was used because a lot of the scenes where someone was being sarcastic or being over the top just reminded me of that show plus for some reason characters like Kage-san just reminded me of lego because their face&#039;s were so expressionless just like the lego faces.<br />
<br />
The comedy was just fantastic there were cliches like the Deus ex Machina cliche that were used as jokes plus there was were a few 4th wall breaks which were pretty funny too, but the characters are what made the show really funny because of their none serious attitude my smile hardly disappeared because it was that funny to watch and the fact that ripping people&#039;s clothes off just to defeat also reminded me of High School DxD and to me that&#039;s always a good thing. The action though short was pretty fun I liked Tamotsu and Matome&#039;s power&#039;s and how Tamotsu gained these powers was actually quite surprising although I think I&#039;ve seen it somewhere before.<br />
<br />
Overall this was a friggin hilarious show if you want something that sorta works like Kill la Kill with it&#039;s comedy then you&#039;re definitely in for something epically amazing.

    So I was originally gonna pass up this anime, I figured it was just another cookie cutter anime and really didn&#039;t think I would enjoy it. Optimistically I thought I might get a small amount of enjoyment out of it, but I never expected that I would have an absolute blast!<br />
<br />
Akiba&#039;s Trip is an anime that knows exactly what it is, what it wants to be, and is completely unapologetic about all of it. It knows that its a fan service-y anime and that means it will lose a lot on depth, but because of that it never allows itself to take itself too seriously.<br />
<br />
Despite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252395">
        this the anime manages to pull off some damn fine comedy, constructs stories that are interesting for a &#039;villain-of-the-week scenario&#039;, and really absorb you into the world of Akiba. Combined with a good cast of characters whom all compliment one another in some way it&#039;s a wild ride right from episode 1. <br />
<br />
Fair warning, there may be some spoilers in these later sections, the point of the above summary is to go over the general idea of what I&#039;ll cover in detail later.<br />
<br />
Story: 7<br />
The story is NOTHING to be impressed about, it has a very basic premise. Simply put it&#039;s &#039;oh look bad guys doing bad guy things watch the good guys do good guy things&#039; with the added &#039;if you get stripped you lose&#039; bit at the end. It is every bit as ridiculous as that sounds, but that&#039;s ok. Like I said this anime never takes itself too seriously, it knows what it is and what it wants to be and isn&#039;t interested in playing up ANY level of melodrama. It&#039;s only goal is to get a few laughs and it accomplishes that which is why I rate it so highly because the story effectively exists in service OF that comedy.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
Again, the art itself isn&#039;t super impressive and the animation is just the &#039;yup that&#039;s anime&#039; level of animation. What REALLY sells this art is the characters. You can tell based off every character you meet that the creative team really ran with the idea that hair color is indicative of whether someone is a Bugged One as a lot of these hairstyles are pretty imaginative. Especially in the main cast whom all seem to function well as a whole, artistically speaking. Unfortunately, animation is a real big deal to me so I can&#039;t really rate it too highly. However, the fact that the characters be they side or main were all fun to just look at speaks volumes to the care that went into crafting them. In my opinion at least.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The sound direction was pretty on point in regards to SFX. I like my SFX to be realistic and the show stays true to that for the most part, and I especially liked the sound effect for when a Bugged One was disrobed really sold that feeling of &#039;whoohoo they did it!&#039; The music choice, much like everything else, was ok. Nothing really wrong with it, nothing really great about it. What&#039;s more important than that was the timing, good sound direction can turn almost anything into something great and this show provides a really standard example of that. A general rule is that the music should never lie to the audience, if its a good moment then the music should reflect that. If the situation is dire again, the music should reflect that. The music choice coupled with the timing of delivery really sold those situations perfectly and it works well with this anime. Again, it&#039;s still nothing spectacular. But I rate it highly because the sound direction made me notice things that this wasn&#039;t just another lazy anime, someone really put effort in and I can appreciate that.<br />
<br />
Comedy: 9<br />
This is a special category that I&#039;m adding in here because it deserves this recognition. It&#039;s really interesting how comedy ISN&#039;T one of the genres used to describe this anime because in my opinion the comedy is the shining star of this anime. The action scenes are ok, nothing fantastic. While the setting creates a &#039;supernatural&#039; feel sure, it doesn&#039;t steal the show. And yea, the fan service is fairly abundant (which while being abundant I must say it was at least tasteful and not just blatantly shoe-horned in) but fan service has never made an anime great it just gives it sex appeal so it can sell well. No, the COMEDY is where this anime stands in the limelight. There is a rule of thumb about comedy that I adore when speaking in regards to skit comedy, &#039;When you put a crazy individual in a world of normal people, or put a normal person in a world of crazy people, that&#039;s where the comedy happens.&#039; and this anime EXEMPLIFIES this. It took me a couple episodes to realize, but in this anime YOU are that normal person. YOU are the one in the crazy world because everyone in this show is NUCKING FUTS! I would go so far as to say that the comedy in this anime could even stand up to the likes of konosuba, which was also brilliant with it&#039;s comedy. It&#039;s the fact that this anime blatantly and unabashedly goes for the most outlandish, far left field idea they can go for and  they make that WORK. By episode 3, I found myself on the edge of my seat just excited to find out what wacky and zany adventures these idiots were gonna find themselves in next. No, the comedy is the true star of this show even if it wasn&#039;t meant to be.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
So there you have it. This show manages to combine mediocrity with greatness in various areas, especially with its comedy. The end result is a world you can get absorbed in, characters you can care about, and good times that will always manage a laugh out of you. An exciting adventure, and a conclusive and satisfying ending with a neat little cliffhanger for a potential second season (Fingers VERY much crossed). So in short, top recommend.<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
Watch it, it&#039;s worth it.

    The Akiba streep animation anime was great, I liked the characters, the fan service, which I really liked, the comedy and I really liked the opening. 2021 the villains were also very good and they were very beautiful the animation was also great hopefully this or the other year we can see a second season and they let us know that things happened in the future and tamotsu and matome have to fix it I hope very much that second one season for the second hopefully miss akohainen has powers and alludes them in the fight and of course continue with the group of dancing
