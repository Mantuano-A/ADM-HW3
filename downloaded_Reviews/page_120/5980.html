    Blood-c is one giant troll of an anime. Unfortunately, it proved so good at the gimmick it used that it chased away most of the audience before the good times started rolling. I was going to give it a stinky 3 by episode five but then I continued watching and by the end it had redeemed itself. Still, that is no excuse for those awful, eye-gouging first episodes. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Since you are most probably a returning customer to the Blood franchise, you are already familiar with the story. Sword-wielding mystery girl in a high school uniform fights man-eating monsters. Mystery is solved in a gory, splattery,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44833">
        bloody, dismembering, brain-bits-flying, bone-cracking way. <br />
Blood-c has no continuity with the previous anime of the franchise. It takes the basic story and spins a different tale. So, if you, like me, were expecting more Haji—gawd, there can never be enough Haji!—you will be sorely disappointed. Sigh~ (Allow me a moment to once again overcome my disappointment in this crucial omission)<br />
So, is this a good story? In a word, yes. But that becomes apparent only when you finish it. Once again, the first few episodes are trolling you in a very horrible way. This would have been acceptable in a 24 episode show but in a 12 episode show it did irreparable damage. So, it requires a certain masochism to get you through to the good part. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
It is very difficult to talk about the characters without including major spoilers, so I&#039;ll do it this way…<br />
Saya is a high school moe-tard klutz by day and a kickass, monster-slaying, katana-wielding warrior by night. How could that possibly be combined, you ask. Watch to the end and be amazed. <br />
The rest of the cast—no, I am not being lazy, it has to be this way—are just as they should be. Watch to the end and be amazed. <br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Anorexic 7-feet-tall people design courtesy of CLAMP aside, this anime really rocks the fight scenes. Smooth, sleek, gory; these scenes are the main reason to watch this anime. Every time it was blood--fest time it was like the anime became ten times better. Even the animation came alive. <br />
<br />
Music:<br />
I noticed three distinct soundtrack groups. One for the horrid slice of life wannabe. One for the creepy times and one for the fight scenes. I must say the creepy times soundtrack impressed me the most. It was exquisitely creepy. <br />
OP: Awesome. Fluid and beautifully stylised animation with a standard j-rock ditty. I wish the whole thing could have been like the OP. <br />
ED: Boring. I skipped it every time. <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
It is very difficult to recommend this because it sabotages itself with a horrible beginning but if you are into gory stuff, this will not disappoint. It is not called “blood” for nothing, you know. Some of the brutal stuff I saw popped my eyes out and I was even watching the censored version. I would have liked to see it uncensored but there is no way I&#039;m watching this again. I would rather re-watch Blood+ ...where Haji is. <br />

    Soooooo, how do you like your revival of a popular franchise? Ruined or half assed, story wise?<br />
<br />
STORY: Years ago there was an unfortunate case of assault, the victim? Blood the last vampire, a popular movie that spawned an even more popular over-hyped anime series: Blood+, the perpetrator had no motives, it was a cruel and brutal assault in form of a live action, and ever since, Blood has been hospitalized in a vegetative state and was never heard from again... Until...<br />
In the year 2011 however, a famous group of manga creators, CLAMP, visited Blood in the hospital in order to try to revive it from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41745">
        it&#039;s vegetative state, in form of a new Blood, Blood Clamp AKA Blood C AKA Blood Crap AKA Blood Crazy...<br />
<br />
That&#039;s a true story, I swear!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I&#039;ll cut to the chase and out right say what we all said: What the fuck happened Clamp? I know we can&#039;t trust you girls to make a decent ending for your manga anymore (Tsubasa for example), but now we can&#039;t trust you girls to do a remake of popular franchises as well? To be fair, lots of people fuck up remakes, but a lot was expected. <br />
Alright I&#039;m riding Clamp too hard here, it&#039;s not all their fault for this failure (I&#039;m being as lenient as possible here), Production I.G. shares some of the blame as well (The series creator is supposedly overlooking the creation of Blood C, but apparently he&#039;s letting Clamp do what they want and not paying attention to what&#039;s going on).<br />
<br />
Where do I begin with whats wrong with Blood C, the beginning? The beginning? Or the ending? A beginning that drags on for way too long, which isn&#039;t a problem... for a 20 something or longer episode anime, Blood C, however, is 12 episodes long (And with a movie coming up too? They&#039;r clearly over estimating their new series)! With 5 episodes of some of the worse character pondering I&#039;ve seen in a while, in a supposedly action anime fulled with irritatingly dull cliches and Clamp cliches... Which all of it is even more frustrating towards the end with quite a dumb plot twist.<br />
<br />
While Blood C isn&#039;t afraid to waste your time (Some of the characters act like they&#039;re self aware of the nothingness that occurs at one point, I guess that&#039;s clever, but it ends up more obnoxious than clever and then there are scenes where a voice keeps talking about things don&#039;t stay the same forever, they make you want to tone out all the nonsense... Nonsense that is relevant however), it&#039;s also not not afraid to push irritating characters, as a couple of twins with no point of being there at all do all the annoying things you expect them to (I&#039;m hoping that I&#039;m not alone in wanting the twins dead... LOL), an emotionless father, and even the main character, Saya, herself! A clumsy school girl with stupid hair (The animators are either lazy or she uses countless cans of hairspray to keep her hair in place outside of the cool looking action scenes) that has a terrible personally swap between serious sword wielding warrior and cute clueless school girl.<br />
<br />
But while Blood C isn&#039;t wasting your time (with character pondering), it&#039;s showing you spectacular and very bloody (The one it gets perfectly right most of the time) battles. Every episode ends with a fight between Saya and a creature called a Elder Bairn or whatever, often ending up with a bloody shower. These fight scenes are the meat experience of Blood C, they&#039;re not battles that you can only experience in Blood C, but they are well animated and well choreographed (Especially the first episode).<br />
However, the blood and gore eventually goes over the top, like Fist of the north star or Devilman over the top. But it&#039;s so fucking crazy that it&#039;s really comical in a way, especially the final episode, it&#039;s one of those so bad it&#039;s actually kinda good episodes that makes you wish the anime was like this from the start.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s the real shame about Blood C, instead of production values, battles, blood, and gore, more time should had went towards crafting a better story or at least one that doesn&#039;t feel like a waste of time, especially for the fans of the Blood anime that came before it.<br />
While I am not a big fan of Blood+ or Blood the last vampire, there really should have been at least a little more for the fans that watched those series first. Of course that&#039;s a good thing that they aren&#039;t relaying on using the same elements from those series, apart from Saya, the creature she fights, and a of course the sword she has to use in order to kill the creatures, but at least throw the old fans a bone once in a while, most of the time it feels like Saya is conserving with absolute strangers, at least have one other recognizable character or element that veteran fans can latch on to.<br />
<br />
And there is one more thing to be said, the later episodes drop a huge ball. Let&#039;s just say Clamp has gotten extremely lazy these days and has decided to bring up a plot device from one of their previous series to advance the plot. So when I said that there&#039;s nothing for Blood fans to enjoy and be familiar with, there&#039;s actually plenty for fans of a recent Clamp title... It&#039;s actually kinda infuriating that Clamp would actually do something as lazy as that. <br />
<br />
The story ends up becoming a retarded fan fiction in a way... But never fully embraces it though, it just overlooks it in a way that it kinda has no point in being mentioned at all.<br />
Another thing that&#039;s pretty lazy is the character development and story twists. They are so uninspired that you&#039;d think the creators are making it up as they go along. And the character developments... Let&#039;s just say that everything&#039;s so half-assed that CLAMP was actually making it proceed in that way just to waste even more of your time... <br />
<br />
ANIMATION: Like I said before the fights are well animated (Most of the time), and fans of clamp are treated to clamps distinctive character designs (Skinny, skinny teenagers with long limbs and perfect bodies), But a lot of the characters designs look bland, and Saya&#039;s new design looks just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
SOUND: Another thing that actually had effort put in it, the music. It&#039;s all great, the fight scenes have great background music to go with them, the voice acting is good, but there&#039;s one thing you may want to rip your ears out, Saya has a habit of singing, for a long time, about the most pointless stuff. It&#039;s hilarious at first, but later you&#039;d wonder, &quot;Is that really important for us to suffer through her American Idol try out practice?&quot;<br />
But to kinda make up for it, both the opening and ending theme music are great (Leave it to the professionals to do the singing Saya), the opening theme song, Spiral by DUSTZ, will be the one good thing you&#039;ll look forward to each episode, and the ending, while not as good, is a great way to end each episode.<br />
At least this is one thing that Production I.G. cared about.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
The Good:<br />
+ Cool battles, when they&#039;re animated well.<br />
+ Great music and opening theme song.<br />
<br />
Mixed:<br />
+/- Good animation, and Clamp character designs/ Clamp characters designs, Saya&#039;s redesign.<br />
+/- The last episode/ the last and second to last episode.<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
- Terrible character pondering, such as Saya and her terrible singing.<br />
- Isn&#039;t afraid to waste your time with absolute pointlessness.<br />
- Annoying characters, especially the twins.<br />
- Nothing for even fans of the original movie or Blood+ to keep their interest.<br />
- Clamp relaying on one of their previous series for story development.<br />
- No point of the character developments of anyone not named Saya <br />
- Ludicrously violent scenes to the point of being cartoonish and comical.<br />
<br />
Despite what I said, I&#039;m actually looking forward to the sequel movie because if the anime continues to go the way the last episode did, at least Blood C will become Blood Cult hit.

    [UPDATE]<br />
<br />
           Half way done and this is by far the most pissed off I ever got while watching an anime its like watching an action version of a NTR. So many unanswered questions as the plot thickens (if there is one). I feel sorry for the fans of the original. I really can&#039;t stand the random deaths that occur in this anime, FANS of BLOOD-C you know what I&#039;m saying because you cant say that you haven&#039;t noticed it. Its like you&#039;re playing this horrible video games and your at a boss fight and you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39224">
        have to rescue bystanders (come the f*%k on y when you see a something that looks strange would you wander in its direction if it was me i was hauling ass out of there). No logical was put into the brains of the background characters (pay close attention to episode 6 and point out all the faults I&#039;ll point out one pay attention to Nono&#039;s appearance look at the street pretty empty for a town filled with shops, businessmen appears out of thin air OH look a random merchant dies what the hell was he doing in that alleyway as he came out running to find out if Saya was alright. You catch the drift.<br />
The best thing about this anime is that its almost over. I read a couple comments on the forums and what I don&#039;t get is how some of you could say &#039;this is SO much like CLAMP good job with this anime&#039;, WTF how is this anything to what clamped has produced over the years it&#039;s not even close to what you&#039;ll expect from them if you check my list you&#039;ll see that all of CLAMPs&#039; production that I&#039;ve see and those that I&#039;ve yet to list was some of the best anime and that i really enjoyed it by checking my score. Blood-C you&#039;re my rage bar filler and by the time I&#039;ve finished watching this series i will read a very entertaining novel by a very world renowned novelist to remove the dark spots on my brain.[END OF UPDATE]<br />
Final review at the end of this anime<br />
<br />
This is what I wanna do after watching this. Cry, Blow my brains out, be resurrected as a zombie and terrorize the living daylight out of the guys at CLAMP.<br />
<br />
After watching 2 episodes of this I am really really disappointed. The story is going no where, its predictable and omg the slow plot and the fact that she&#039;s singing please stop, it&#039;s the singing that makes me want to roll my brains down Mt. Everest. The time it takes where she is sing can be better put to use like developing a plot with one of the other characters that was introduced in the 1st episode.<br />
<br />
Everyone that has seen Blood+ I suggest you watch it to get an idea of what your supposed to be watching and if you have seen it already re-watch the first 2 episode compare it to Blood C and you&#039;ll know what a total let down this is.<br />
<br />
I will not drop the series because there is still room to see what&#039;s gonna happen after all it&#039;s only 2 episodes, &#039;right.&#039; <br />
<br />
My point system based out of 10<br />
Character design-<br />
        The fact that she is a supposedly badass, the glasses long squiggly twin tail hair is just plain bad. She fights in the same uniform she goes to school with after going home her father could atleast provide her with a new fitting of clothes along with her sword. (4)<br />
<br />
Art design-<br />
        The art isn&#039;t bad but it isn&#039;t that good either each character was well drawn but they lack the memorable depth that was realized from the Blood+ series. The only memory that gonna stain your brain is that badly drawn hair of Saya. Who knows maybe they&#039;ll decide to cut it or remove the wookies that hold it together. (6)<br />
<br />
Story-<br />
        JUST PLAIN BAD! ugh. (2). Hopefully this would change after all it&#039;s only 2 episodes &#039;right&#039;.<br />
<br />
Overall-<br />
There is allot of room that can change my view of this series, like I&#039;ve said perviously it&#039;s only 2 episodes so far and my review is subject to change after the first arch is completed. (5)

    This is a spoiler free review.<br />
Also this is my first review, so be nice. And English is not my native language, so sorry if there are some mistakes.<br />
<br />
Ok, So this is the third installment in the Blood franchise by Production I.G. Which is a great studio that had done some amazing things, but at the same time it&#039;s no stranger to failing miserably, as demonstrated by this particular anime.<br />
<br />
*Story*<br />
<br />
Well, if you&#039;re familiar with the previous &#039;Blood&#039; installments, you&#039;d know that the premise is about a schoolgirl with a sword who fights vampire-like creatures known as &#039;Teropterids&#039; in the original movie,  and &#039;Chiropterans&#039; in Blood+.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97223">
        In this version she fights creatures that are nothing like vampires, but basically just man eating monsters. Which is actually a pretty cool change that I&#039;m okay with. Anyway, Since this is a remake, it goes without saying that the premise nothing new, but to its credit, at least it tries to change it a little bit (though it doesn&#039;t pay off, unfortunately).<br />
<br />
The story itself is very weak, because it lacks actual content and a lot of the episodes are semi episodic and they don&#039;t reveal any significant clue about what the monsters are and what&#039;s underneath the surface here. That is except for the last two and a half episodes. That means you can basically watch the first 9 episodes and be none the wiser about what&#039;s taking place than you were in episode 1. In fact, you&#039;ll only have more questions (though not many since hardly anything happens that seems important). All you have happening in each episode is some boring slice of life/school stuff.. which hardly has any bearing on the plot (and very little on character development) and then it goes straight to the next monster battle.<br />
<br />
It has a weak presentation and despite being a much shorter series it&#039;s pacing seems worse than Blood+&#039;s pacing. At least in Blood+ you had 50 episodes in which things actually progress through out them, even if it was a little slow.. Here you have a pointless monster of the week formula, boring dialogue and some minor clues here and there for 9 1/2 episodes and only the remaining 2 1/2 have the meat of the story (which makes it very rushed and badly planned). <br />
<br />
So it probably could&#039;ve worked (slightly) better if it was just a 6 or 7 episode OVA instead of 12 episodes + a full length movie. Speaking of which, this series might remind you of some bad Gore OVAs from the 80s, but with modern moe girls and pretty boys etc&#039;.<br />
<br />
Anyway,  I won&#039;t spoil anything, but in the last 2 episodes of the series an insane twist is revealed that was supposedly in plain sight the whole time (which to its credit, was cleverly foreshadowed).  But be warned since it is very farfetched and poorly excused, so you&#039;d most likely be left scratching your head... Yes, even with the poor amount of story it has, it fails to make sense of it. The twist is just a bad excuse for every absurdity in this anime. I did like the basic idea behind it, but it was done very poorly.<br />
Oh and it ends with a cliffhanger, so you  have to watch the sequel movie for the conclusion (which was so boring, slow and mostly predictable,  I nearly fell asleep watching it).<br />
<br />
So In a nutshell, the story has little quantity, no quality, a corny and anti climatic conclusion. So yeah, I&#039;m gonna say the story is pretty bad. <br />
<br />
*Characters*<br />
<br />
The main character&#039;s name is Saya and she has different personalities in each Blood installment. One thing they have in common though is that they all have a badass monster hunter mode and a normal girl mode.<br />
In the original movie Saya was actually pretty bland, but that was only a 50 min movie, so there&#039;s not much time for fleshing out characters. <br />
In Blood+ Saya had a great personality that was fleshed out properly. She was kinda cute, but I&#039;m sure nobody would argue that she was a moeblob. Besides, she behaved in ways that were very believable and realistic. Pretty much what you&#039;d expect from a teenage girl in that situation.<br />
<br />
In this version on the other hand, she IS more of a moeblob that panders shamelessly to the otaku base. No attempt for realism here.<br />
She&#039;s a cute and sensitive klutz who&#039;s good at sports.. So you&#039;re probably wondering how a klutz can be good at sports? does that add up? Though I might be wrong here, I really don&#039;t think it does.. But who cares!? she&#039;s a fetish for fanboys!<br />
<br />
But regardless, even the part about her being &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;caring&quot; which is established quite clearly in the beginning of the series, is thrown out the window later on when she doesn&#039;t even flinch at the sight of her friends and others who live in her village being brutally slaughtered by monsters (and notice that this is not when she&#039;s in badass mode). <br />
Not to mention that she recovers way too fast after witnessing these horrible deaths. Some of which she could&#039;ve prevented, but didn&#039;t for no reason whatsoever (or rather, the reason is just to show gorey deaths). So the little character development it has is laughable. On top of that, Saya is the only character with a backstory and even the one she has is very lame and vague.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast isn&#039;t even worth mentioning. They&#039;re all familiar cardboard cutouts you won&#039;t care about, and/or just there to die. Oh and the monsters have no personality either. No surprise there though.<br />
<br />
The characters are horrendous! <br />
<br />
*Art*<br />
<br />
I&#039;m personally not a fan of Clamp&#039;s artwork and though I know some people are, I doubt even they will claim that Clamp&#039;s skinny + moe + bishounen + bright colors art style fits an anime as grim and Gorey as this. <br />
<br />
To its credit however, the animation is fluid and certainly an improvement over Blood+. <br />
<br />
Also the monsters have pretty creative (scary) designs and each monster is unique and fights differently. Much better than the Chiropreran in Blood+. And the monster battles themselves are very well done and with extreme Elfen Lied-style exaggerated gore (actually this is even more Gorey than Elfen Lied).<br />
The only problem I have with the battles is that Saya could&#039;ve got a little more injured to make most of the battles less one sided.<br />
<br />
The art&#039;s really good overall though not really my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
*Sound*<br />
<br />
Not much I can say about this department.<br />
The opening sounds nice, but it has a lot of engrish, which is kind of annoying.<br />
The ending song is ok, I guess.<br />
The sound effects are good, but they sometimes feel out of place. For example when Saya clashes with a monster with her sword, it sounds like the monster is made out of metal.<br />
Can&#039;t say much about the OST, I guess it&#039;s pretty forgettable.<br />
Even though I don&#039;t know Japanese, I guess the voice acting&#039;s ok, nothing special though.<br />
<br />
The sound as a whole ain&#039;t bad.<br />
<br />
*Enjoyment*<br />
<br />
This is a very subjective part of the review, so let&#039;s put it this way: if you Like Gore, you will enjoy this. If you like a little bit of moeness and Gore combined you&#039;ll enjoy this even more. <br />
That is of course if you can overlook the quality of the storyline and the characters. Personally? I didn&#039;t enjoy it much. The whole thing just felt unnecessarily mean spirited and unpleasant. Don&#039;t get me wrong,  there are some nice battles that were fun to look at, but they also felt empty because there isn&#039;t much context behind it, and you don&#039;t care about the characters involved. In fact, you might end up rooting for the monsters at some point.<br />
<br />
*Overall* 4/10<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not the worst I&#039;ve ever seen, but overall it&#039;s pretty damn bad and it takes the franchise a few steps backwards instead of going forwards.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll give this series some credit though - it&#039;s among the most violent anime I&#039;ve ever seen (it&#039;s insane!). Though the violence in it is stylized differently, it should still be up there together with Genocyber, Violence Jack, Shigurui, the Hokuto no Ken OVA and others.

    If you&#039;ve seen Blood+ and the Blood movie, this will be a letdown for you.<br />
<br />
One of the predominant aspects of the Blood saga is the character design and individuality of the characters.<br />
<br />
Aspiring to be a total mindfuck and actually achieving it (many that try lose direction and fail hard) played a big part of the original series and the plot unfolded with a carefully crafted direction.<br />
<br />
.....time travel to 2011 and the batshit annorexic artists from CLAMP get to starting a &quot;remake&quot;, turning the brooding vampiress Saya into a clumsy happy go lucky halfwit who plays a good hand in destroying the girls with glasses =

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38649">
        kawaii fanclub in the process.<br />
<br />
Combining all of the above with Characters designs that are overused and reminiscent of late 80&#039;s anime (without the heavy use of shading however) and you get a series that if you&#039;ve seen the original will probably end up finding yourselves moving it from plan to watch to dropped in the first 5 minutes of watching.....<br />
<br />
Some Reimaginings should be kept as just that, and not played out in an actual remake.

    Let&#039;s be honest, Blood C is probably one of the most controversial animes I have seen in all of my time of watching anime. Never have I seen so much bitterness and hatred against a show. Well, let me be the first to present the opposite of the mainstream opinions: I loved Blood C (gasp!) Before you turn away however, please let me explain.<br />
<br />
Blood C is literally a creative liberation from the two sister series in the Blood franchise; the only connection (so far) is that they all focus on a girl named Saya who wields a sword and fights monsters. Blood + had 50

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42833">
        episodes, and thus had plenty of arcs and time to develop its very large cast- Blood C, on the other hand, at the most, has 12 episodes, and thus uses most of its time to build up atmosphere. Which it excels at, at the expense of fleshing out the secondary characters. Before you rain on my parade, there are a few things to note; Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, which includes the movie Blood; The Last Vampire, and Blood +, the sequel anime show. Please, please stick this in your head now: Blood C has absolutely nothing to do with these two installments. It is a mere sister series with the shadow of the concept. Thus treat this as an entirely new show.<br />
<br />
That said, I will put it out forward: Blood C is either a show you are going to loathe or that you are going to love. Most people hated it, some people liked it. I loved it. It is not for people who are looking for interesting fabulous fleshed out characters (this is coming from someone who is the biggest sucker for character development). This is a show that focuses on atmosphere and building it. It is a horror series. It is not an action series, though the action scenes in this show are some of the most creative, well animated ones I have seen.<br />
<br />
It is literally horror at its best- I assure you that if you&#039;re a sucker for the type of horror which is more psychological than just pop-outs, this show is for you. If you hate slow build ups, move on. The first half of Blood C focuses on instilling the surreal setting and life of the show into your head. I won’t deny it; the first four episodes or so are pretty dull because they are monotonous; Saya sings a song to school, chatters with her buddies, and fights a monster. What you don’t realize is that this is all- and I mean all of it, pay attention to all the details- for a very good reason, which comes later. This is the part where I admit that there are some flaws; this could have been easily condensed into three episodes max. It still does a good job of developing a very eerie aura though; you have the constant feeling that something is very wrong about this town, and yet you can’t place your finger on it. There&#039;s an eerie tension consistently kept despite the seemingly innocuous events; a tension that&#039;s about to snap and yet you don&#039;t know when or how. <br />
<br />
So whereas the first half spends its time just fleshing the atmosphere and setting of the world Saya lives in, and the latter half spends the next half tearing that world down.  Allow me to present you the latter half of Blood C, which absolutely shines like no other. Halfway throughout this show, you are literally smacked in the face. Repeatedly. In each episode. This is the real deal- you are given cruel reality of the situation; and goddamn, it is cruel. It is merciless. I am not just talking about the gore, which mind you, is on par of that of Narutaru, which has some of the most disturbing scenes I have seen yet. The gore is of course, censored (not the show’s fault, the network’s fault, something which will be fixed when the DVDs come out and dear lord then you can let your stomach churn), but that’s not what makes it horrifying; it’s the way the gore happens, the way no one is spared in this show, the sounds which are so gruesomely realistic. This is not a show for the faint of heart. But the gore is only the sprinkles on the actual cake. The cake is the series of red herrings and plot twists that wrench your heart. You will witness in horror, how everything in front of you, how every trope known to anime kind, is smashed and ripped apart. If anything, Blood C excels at building atmosphere and horror. The fight scenes are as fabulous as they are gruesome.  But yes. Blood C&#039;s purpose and key to the show is how it builds up the plot layer by layer, paranoia by paranoia. The villains are completely ruthless, and there is no battle fought without someone dying.<br />
<br />
The characters are where things get messy. There’ s two very good reasons why none of the cast except Saya is fleshed out. Nevertheless, they are pretty stereotypical, and are very CLAMPish. But once again; you don’t really end up bothering about them for good reasons. Saya herself is very likeable; you come to empathize with her situation if anything and while you might get irritated with her….inepititude, at times, you have to understand what she’s going through. In the end, this show is about her for reasons you have yet to find out, so don’t be quick to judge!<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the last, and most important aspect of an anime; how it ends. I have two huge problems with anime, as someone who has seen more than enough for a lifetime.<br />
<br />
1.) The ending is rushed. You have no idea how frustrating this is. This is not a tv drama in which a season’s ending can be bad and can pick itself off the ground later on. This is a conclusion and nothing is more irritating and annoying than loving a show only to see the worst plot holes and resolution possible.<br />
<br />
2.) Animes that build up to a movie, or huge series, tend to be terrible. Let’s look at two prime examples; .hack//ROOTS was the buildup to the game series, .hack//G.U Trilogy, and it just failed as an individual series because it only left us with very little to deal with and just a fancy commercial to buy the games. Higashi no Eden had wonderful, wonderful potential but got axed by the fact that it was nothing but a mere leg for the two movies to follow. As individual series, these tend to absolutely collapse.<br />
<br />
Blood C completely surpasses these two typical faults and succeeds. It paces itself extremely, extremely well; the finale was fantastic and does not leave any open ties that cannot be answered by a movie sequel. The buildup to the finale itself is wonderful, for the most part; while the first part lags a little, it’s not a huge problem and hell, once you’re in, you are stuck in for the biggest ride. Not only does it separate itself as an individual show, and actually solve most of the problems raised in the show and leave a resolution (or many) for it to be complete on its own, but it manages to still raise questions and leave some unanswered so that it can tie itself over with the movie. You are left with a feeling of excitement and resolution; you want to go back and rewatch the series again, but at the same time you’re excited that some big questions are going to be answered in the movie installment.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s even greater is the subtlety- you can go back through this series and catch on the really tiny moments and dialogue that what were once usually tasteless random things, are now essential ‘oh!’ moments where you realize there’s two (or more) things being said. I’m a huge fan of subtlety and I guess that’s why I’m such a passionate fan of this show, and I’m really glad they’re doing stuff like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, Blood C was fabulous for me. It had the layered buildup of Shiki, the horror of Ghost Hound and themes of Jigoku Shoujo, and gore of Shadow Star. If you like horror, and well paced ones, then totally go for this. It’s not for everyone though, and it’s definitely not for the faint of heart. It takes huge, huge risks, risks that most series would not go for, but it manages to complete the leap and land with a very solid and steady landing.  I personally, I believe Blood C is a remarkable show that pushes the boundaries of the Blood franchise and creates horror by clashing it with the mundane, ordinary life- only making it more frightening than ever.<br />

    I really wanted to like this series. I really did. I&#039;m a fan of &quot;a girl with sword fights monsters&quot;, and because of it, I usually am quite forgiving, but this is a truly dreadful show.<br />
<br />
It starts innocently enough - the characters are pretty to look at, and the setting, a small town, a high school and a temple, pleasant enough. The first couple of episodes fool you with a promise of goods that will never be delivered. <br />
<br />
The characters are pretty flat with no development to speak of. I could not bring myself to like Saya, who, as the protagonist, too many times just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43257">
        stood there, watching people, even her friends, die. We can forgive a hero the deaths when they try hard and fail, but watching and not acting is simply indefensible. <br />
<br />
It seems like there was no story to tell - most episodes are repetitive, filled with a battle scene and piling up dead. There is a touch of mystery, as Saya tries to remember some vague promise, which, at this point, just seems like a poor attempt at creating drama.<br />
<br />
In the end, there are two things I enjoyed - the art is the only redeeming feature of Blood-C and Saya&#039;s song, catchy, but abandoned after the initial few episodes. Both not enough to save the show as far as I am concerned. With just 3 episodes left till the end, I can&#039;t imagine anything Blood-C can do to change or improve.

    Please note before reading: I have not seen Blood+, Blood: The Last Vampire both live action nor animated, for that reason I am going to review this as a separate series on it&#039;s own.<br />
<br />
Saya Kisaragi, a normal school girl and shrine maiden by day, demon slayer by night, Blood-C happens to be very slow at first, but presents a lot of foreshadowing throughout the first few episodes.<br />
<br />
This series has a lot of gore, a lot more than I expected, actually. Most of the /really/ gory stuff in censored, but you still get a general idea of what&#039;s happening in the scene.<br />
<br />
The fighting is excellent, Saya

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42197">
        sure knows how to handle a sword! I&#039;ve seen about six/seven fights in the series so far, and each one makes my heart pound when I watch it.<br />
<br />
The art is brilliant, the character designs are very fresh, and go easy on the eyes when you look at them, my favourites happen to be Saya herself, her father, her best friend, and her teacher. The character development is little, but the series still presents enough for you to pick up on.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t even get me started on the music, the opening (combining both Japanese, English, AND french) is just amazing, I had to replay it over and over when I first listened to it, the same goes for the ending theme, too.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this is a very good series to pick up on, most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are sorely disappointed because Blood-C is not a duplicate of Blood+. I am not a big fan of CLAMP&#039;s works but I can say that they really have outdone themselves with this.

    As a person who&#039;ve watched Blood+ before, I came in with some expectations for Blood-C. I was a little disappointed with how it was made. However, I am not going to be one of those people who will say that Blood-C was &quot;a giant troll of an anime&quot; or &quot;half assed&quot;. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what they think of the anime and should not persuade others who are going to watch it, to stay away because they think that it was terrible.<br />
<br />
The story follows a Shrine Maiden, Kisaragi Saya, as she lives a normal school life by down and hunts down

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45811">
        and kills these &quot;Old ones&quot;, who eats humans. In every episode, there is a guarantee that she kills at least one per episode... which is kind of repetitive. In my opinion, the story really starts to pick up towards the end, at around episode 10. In the first few episodes, I was putting Blood-C off, thinking that it was boring. As I progressed further into watching it, I was addicted to it and was intrigued by the end. I hope that the movie will turn out better than the series, and that it will finish.<br />
<br />
The art is decent in this anime. Although, it was sloppy at times. There wasn&#039;t a whole lot of effort put into the art, as it wasn&#039;t that detailed. For example: a person is killed and when there is a different angle, you won&#039;t see that person that is killed anywhere on the screen.<br />
<br />
The sound was pretty repetitive throughout the same series. Saya would always sing different songs about her daily encounters, but with the same tune. There wasn&#039;t a variety of background music that was used. <br />
<br />
For characters, I would&#039;ve liked to know some characters a little bit better, like Tokizane Shinichirou. Many of the characters were shrouded in mystery, viewers didn&#039;t get to know them. The characters were just... there.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime was pretty enjoyable. I was really captivated by it near the end. I just wished that the producers would&#039;ve let it end in the series instead of making it into the movie. Well, since they are getting funded by the Japanese Government, the movie better be good... considering the money spent on this movie could&#039;ve gone to a better cause.

    Alright, i&#039;m gonna describe Blood-C in a nutshell:<br />
<br />
I watched The Room, Birdemic, Troll 2, Gymkata, A Serbian Film, The Last Airbender and several MST3k episodes like Prince of Space, Werewolf, Invaders from  Neptune, Sandy Frank&#039;s Gamera films and Manos.<br />
<br />
And none of them are as bad as Blood-C.<br />
<br />
Yes, i enjoyed all those bad movies more than Blood-C.<br />
<br />
Seriously, i enjoyed A Serbian Film more than Blood-C. Yup, a movie which features Newborn Porn and countless numbers of necrophilia is more fun to watch than Blood-C!<br />
<br />
Congratulations Production IG and CLAMP! You made A Serbian Film tolerable! By making the worst iteration of the Blood franchise exist, you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44261">
        guys pretty much made A Serbian Film more tolerable!<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is one of the worst anime of 2011. It&#039;s up there with Rio! Rainbow Gate and Oniikoto as thee worst anime iof 2011. But atleast Rio! had some decent fanservice to make up for it&#039;s shittiness. This? NOTHING!<br />
<br />
There is nothing in this series that can make up for how bad it is. Hell, not even Nana Mizuki tries her best to improve this pile of shit. Hell, whenever she talks about cube marshmallows and sing the same fucking song in every episode, you can just hear Nana Mizuki&#039;s inner thoughts saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, i have to do 12 episodes of this shit. What the fuck am i doing here? I was expecting some xxxHolic and Geass, but i got this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
And speaking of CLAMP, they did a really shitty job at EVERYTHING in this series. The character designs are really awful, and it doesn&#039;t even stack up to their other character designs. And nanase Ohkawa wasn&#039;t even trying to make this series better. It&#039;s like she just copypasta&#039;d the first half of episode 1 into the other 11 episodes. The writing of this series is so bad that you feel like you&#039;re watching a shittier remake of Endless Eight as written by Uwe Boll.<br />
<br />
And what sound? What music? There&#039;s nothing memorable about any of the music of this series. Nana Mizuki&#039;s morning song in each episode sucked, and the OP is just some shitty J-Rock filer music by some band i don&#039;t even give a shit about.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: IT SUCKED. It made even the worst film in history look good. it made Mars of Destruction and Dragonaut look like Citizen Kane! I dropped this shit after episode 3 because i&#039;d rather read all the other summaries of the other episodes on 4chan than watching this series. That shows how bad it is. Oh, and i want to cockpunch anyone who claims to like this series. If you even say that you like this series, then you&#039;re an asshole and you deserve to lose your genitals just like all the other male characters drawn by CLAMP.<br />
<br />
Fuck this, i need to go for a drink.

    Note: This is not really a review, but as what the title suggest, it is an &quot;episode impressions&quot;. Will edit this into a &quot;full review&quot; once the series has ended.<br />
<br />
Story: Not much to say here other than what most people probably already knew, that this series has the same concept only in different variation to that already found in the other Blood franchises which started from &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)&quot; and followed by &quot;Blood+ (2005).&quot; As an introductory episode, it left me some very good impressions that this anime is something I’ll definitely be looking forward watching week-after-week.<br />
<br />
For the actual episode itself, it begins

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38851">
        with some interesting discussion about the definition of a person then progress to the introduction of the main character and the people around her. All in all the events was pretty standard for first episodes. The highlight of the episode is in the later part concerning Saya&#039;s duty which immediately shifted the mood from lighthearted to serious and the fight in the end which have some good slasher moments.<br />
<br />
Animation: The color tones used are a bit dull but it fits the overall theme of the series which is more on the darker side. Character designs is very CLAMP; the facial features in distant camera shots appears to be detailed so it is something noteworthy for me. The environmental detail is a bit lacking and doesn’t appear HD quality to me but it was offset by the grainy details that are observable in the animation. I like how the battle is animated in the final minutes, very well choreograph although the enemy lacks detail, it just look like a big piece of moving muddy rock, it could be better.<br />
<br />
Sound: OP and ED themes are good but not something I’ll be listening every time I watch an episode of Blood-C. The soundtracks are however great specially in the fight scene; It composed mostly of tracks that sounds strangely familiar which I may have already heard from somewhere else, but the overall impact are great. The voice behind Saya did a very good job giving life to her character and charm (I like the scene of Saya singing, and I felt…Oh! It’s a wonderful voice), I could also recognize some very familiar voices which I’m excited to hear more as the series progresses.<br />
<br />
Character: I’ll talk about Saya, so far I like how she transforms from a carefree individual into someone so BADASS (with that fiery-looking eyes); I’m a person with a natural inclination for female characters with strong personalities, granted she didn’t look like someone fitting that description from the outside, but after witnessing how calm she was battling her opponent, I’m convince that she has it inside her. As for the other characters, not much details are revealed so I it is something I will be looking forward next episodes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The episode did well and I felt that it did what any first episode should do —- give a good impression to its viewers that will make them look forward watching the series, obviously I have a very good enjoyment on it. Initially, I felt the character design is out of place but after quickly remembering that it is done by CLAMP, my impression quickly rebounded positively. I have watched this episode 3x already before this writing.<br />
<br />
Updates:<br />
<br />
ep.6: Massive while-lines across the screen, it somehow kills the enjoyment, had to watch the BD versions once it&#039;s out.<br />
<br />
ep.7: Story is getting more interesting in exchange, the animation quality is dropping considerably compared to the first few episodes<br />
<br />
ep.11: Am I suppose to laugh at these episode? It’s amusing and unbelievably funny, I was laughing from disbelief on all the revelations this episode, the way it’s executed, and the character reactions.<br />
<br />
ep.12: I say the ending redeems the series for me as it reminded me again that feelings I have from watching episode 1 and other Blood franchises, the very feelings why I watched Blood-C in the first place.<br />
<br />
I’m still gathering my thoughts on how to rate this series as it is shown to me, I like to write a proper final impression for Blood-C, it’s a wild ride, but it’s a worthy wild ride.

    Oh how the mighty have fallen, CLAMP, one of the most highly regarded group of mangaka, decide that their fame and good word of mouth was just too much. In order to forever scar their reputation, they decide to get their Blood the last vampire/Their own series they made cross over fanfiction animated, and the result?<br />
<br />
Blood C, one of the most hideous and disgusting things to have ever spawn from the inter hateful and disgusting minds of beloved manga creators, CLAMP.<br />
<br />
Hateful? I&#039;ll get to that in a minute, but unarguably disgusting no doubt. Where over the top meets pure carnage where even the most tortured

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56059">
        soul from Hostile will be again thrown into a fit of pure agony.<br />
And it&#039;s only insulting when all of this occurs after you have already gone through meaningless, pointless, time wasting and infuriating six to ten episodes of nothingness. All of that precious time gone, and what do you get in return? Well, you get enough unexplained plot points (Unexplained as in, the explanations are too farfetched to believe in) to reassure yourself that nothing made any sense in the end, an ending that only shown you that you HAVE to watch what comes next for the end of this garbage.<br />
And a lot of the frustration, correction, possibly all of the frustration actually comes from the cast of bland throw aways (Literally) and an idiot who fails at level of what a &quot;hero&quot; is supposed to do, or for that matter, care about what she should do.<br />
<br />
Saya, a bubbly dimwit who loves to sing about what she ate for breakfast, is a high school student of school of essentially food for whatever random monster (Random is the best way to describe it, from giant samurai to raving rabbits on steroids, there is no rhyme or reason for their designs) comes to town fiending for a midnight snack, is quite simply, uninteresting, even at night where her &quot;father&quot; sends her to fight the creatures of the night. I&#039;ll admit, I found myself rewatching the first episode&#039;s beat down for how well animated and choreographed it was, despite some &quot;huh?&quot; moments (Her neck isn&#039;t broken? That monster&#039;s arm must have been made of lead.), to only be pleasantly disappointed by the next round of monster bashing (Monster train car and a tachikoma/Audrey 2 from little shop of horrors hate-off anyone?).<br />
Hold on a sec, I lost track of who I was talking about, Saya was it? Well, if I can go on to other things while I should be explaining her character, then my single word description might be dead on, when talking about her good traits... If she had any I guess.<br />
<br />
Other characters, meh, ehhhh, bland throw aways? If only that was the absolute case, but for this reviews sake, I&#039;ll only say you might as well slap troll faces on the entire cast, even the puppy dog that walks around is full of bullshit and giggles (You have to see it for yourself by how much bullshit it really is).<br />
Oh, there I go again, Saya is boring blah, blah, blah... But then there&#039;s her bad, no, just horrible traits. For CLAMP, I can only guess they were trying to throw something new into the bag of &quot;pin the trait on the hero&quot; party amusement, a trait where she only fails until the last second, but ultimately still failed. But that itself fails on every level, you surprised? You really shouldn&#039;t be, because who the hell can root for a failure who, no parentheses holding a snark comment, literally watches everything around torn to bloody desert dishes for the hungry hungry monsters, and literally yells &quot;I WILL RESCUE YOU!&quot; or something similar to that. Saya is a character that simply sits around and gets trolled throughout the entire series (In fact her life is simply the product of someone fucking around with her), and fails to protect friends and loved ones, which comes to another point, a one point she protect a classmate who comes out to her by admitting his affection for her, the next episode, he dies, dies a truly pathetic death one befitting a back ground character, and Saya practicably shrugs it off, no joke.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s moments like those that made me wonder, characters, like named ones, are dying left and right, like how a nobody stock character would. Many could say there was something suspicious about it, but the reveal is simply a middle finger, mocking you, Saya, the fans of CLAMP and good twists in general. But I could forgive that, as long as there was something to get out of it, maybe the action scenes and battles? Okay episode one sure, but the ending spits on that possibility with nauseating gratuitous gore and blood flash floods, Itchy and Scratchy renditions of overblown proportions that disgust and impress, like an awe inspired crowd that somehow witnessed a septic tank set off like a nuclear explosion.<br />
It impressed me, that CLAMP would go this far, it&#039;s almost... fetishy in a way, like the anime is getting off from from the blood and guts being feverishly devoured, and the last episode enforces that, it&#039;s too sickening to think about it any further. I mean, where&#039;s the director in all this? Well, he allowed it, in all of CLAMP&#039;s bloody desire for violence on a disturbing level, and to the most fucked up way imaginable, especially how people are massacred endlessly in this anime (I will never look at a blender the same way ever again... Urgh, you really don&#039;t want to know what a blender has to do with anything in this anime). It&#039;ll really get you thinking, like does CLAMP really think in such horrible ways? How fucked up do you have to get to conceive the idea of making mass murders like this series lovably displays? I know of other series that me personally feel like my stomach dropped out of my body (Shigurai is pretty fucked up), but the cartoonish approach to the slaughter isn&#039;t just vomit inducing, it&#039;s insane with a capital Blerrrgh. %100 unnecessary and %100 flat out gross.<br />
<br />
In short, Blood C is ultimately a disgusting gigantic waste of time, I can only recommend to watch it to only to see just how vile it really is, and if you didn&#039;t see what was so disgusting about it, I&#039;d probably recommend seeing a psychologist immediately, chances are you might be just as fucked up as CLAMP&#039;s bloody horrific mind set.

    Now that we are almost halfway into the show, I feel I can finally write an almost halfway decent review for this show. <br />
<br />
I will be brutally honest; because this show is not Blood+ or Blood the Last Vampire; Because Kai, Riku, Haji (Hagi), David, Diva, Solomon, the entire cast of the old Blood series who had captured our hearts and led us through an epic human drama are all missing. I was disappointed.<br />
<br />
Proudly wearing my blood-colored spectacles, I admittedly was, from the first episode, biased against Saya Kisaragi. Her goodie-two-shoe personality, her &quot;Kyou wa ii tenki&quot; song, the pacing of her story, her odd

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40905">
        schizophrenia, her friends, her family, everything about her world just didn&#039;t feel right. It didn&#039;t feel like Blood.<br />
<br />
But then, as I continued inexplicably to watch this show every week as soon as it came out, realization struck me: Blood C is not a bad show. Hell, Blood C is a good show. Indeed, Blood C doesn&#039;t have the dark romance of a soul-bound chevalier. It does lack the harrowing depth of an eon old epic. And it&#039;s lead character does not possess the heartbreaking ephemeral delicate elegance of a schoolgirl neither human nor monster. But what Blood C has it has in great volume: entertainment value.<br />
<br />
From its OP to its ED, Blood C presents a solid music score does its job of setting up the background and atmosphere. Blood C&#039;s art style - done in the standard Clamp fashion - has both moments of devious beauty (Saya&#039;s smile at the end of the opening) and moments of sheer oddity (Saya&#039;s hair-puff, male characters). The animation from Production IG, however, is as always excellent and both complements and compensates for Clamp&#039;s art style (which is usually very hit-or-miss).<br />
<br />
In terms of show content, however, the character and story develops slowly. The beginning episodes of the show, admittedly, present us with a rather bland plot and highly Clamp-cliched characters. But these characters, the story, and Saya&#039;s world develops and grows (albeit slowly) and, by episode 5, the tide of bloody darkness has already dyed with color the initially monochrome Saya and crew. <br />
<br />
Thus while certainly not the best show this season (for me, that title is reserved for Usagi Drops), Blood C is nevertheless a solid anime. Saya may not be the most likeable or emotionally realistic character this season, I still find myself intrigued by story. I look forward to seeing what will come of this show next week.

    I really wanted to like this anime, I originally watched it because I was a big fan of Blood+ anime and thought perhaps this was it re done or a spin off. The premise of the anime is pretty similar, girl Saya lives among humans protecting them from creatures and can&#039;t really say more of the basic premise and how it&#039;s similar without giving away spoilers.<br />
<br />
But my point was that the elements of story line are similar, but that&#039;s about it. The almost total lack of plot, plot development, character models, character development. Just about anything, it&#039;s basically just the elements of story line thrown

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169385">
        together into a mush with filler added. Even the dialogue and ways in which the characters express themselves is dull.<br />
<br />
By episode three I wanted to stop watching, but after reading other reviews and wanting to always give all anime&#039;s a chance, I watched tell the end and I got through it. All I can really say is that this was honestly a horrible anime, with the only memorable parts being the gore, the average art, and the strings of storyline that made an awesome anime when they where in Blood+.<br />
<br />
If you like the elements of story line present, and want to see them presented in a much better way I recommend checking out Blood+. Stay away from this train wreck unless you have time to kill and expectations to crush. <br />

    Blood-C is a lot of things, but above all, it&#039;s a very painful series to watch. Is it painful to watch because of how interesting and moving the characters are? I wish I could say that but no, it&#039;s painful because I could only take five episodes of this garbage before considering whether or not to outright drop it. <br />
<br />
As a long time fan of the Blood series, I expected a lot more from this show and if I had not been a fan beforehand, I&#039;d likely have dropped this instead of seeing it all the way through. Now don&#039;t get me wrong, there&#039;s value

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87669">
        in watching this show, but don&#039;t expect to actually enjoy it as much as you&#039;ll enjoy using it as an example of how &#039;not&#039; to make a new addition to the Blood franchise. <br />
<br />
Honestly, at first, the show appears as if it has an interesting premise, using much of the first episode to build up for a potential climax, in which we see our slow protagonist suddenly drawing a blade and butchering some evil dohicky that&#039;s likely going to be our show&#039;s antagonist. It was built up step by step to reach the climax of the episode, where our bland and boring, yet rather cute protagonist goes through a series of sequences - That she repeats in every single freaking episode for more than five minutes with little to no changes between each one. <br />
<br />
Nearly -all- of the episodes are the damned same, and not even in a good way that makes you want to continue watching, they&#039;re just literally presented in the same manner. I&#039;m not even talking about a Haruhi repetition, this was outright just rehashing the same plot for every episode without changing -anything-, while briefly introducing us to other boring and uninteresting characters, but hey, that&#039;s fine. It&#039;s in a modern setting, the characters aren&#039;t supposed to be especially interesting. - EXCEPT MAYBE OUR PROTAGONIST, who has about as much personality as a walking, singing doll. <br />
<br />
Moving along, the action scenes at the end of nearly every single episode are worth watching but not worth the amount of time you have to wait to actually get to them. There&#039;s nothing to feel about the monsters she&#039;s killing, they&#039;re just the generic bad guys that she&#039;s been given the duty of slaying by her weirdo father who barely ever speaks to her. The name of the series is Blood,  and they do a good job in nailing that in, OVER AND OVER with gigantic blood baths in every single episode. Now, I liked this at first. If the series has no interesting characters and no change in plot every single episode, I might as well enjoy the gore, right? Wrong! In the versions I watched at least, they began censoring all of the gore about half-way through the damned series. When the Japanese start censoring gore, something just doesn&#039;t feel right.I assume the DvD release had an uncensored version but even so, I&#039;m not fortunate enough to be able to afford such a thing and to be honest, I&#039;d never want anyone to spend money on this garbage. <br />
<br />
This series could have been so much better. I like Studio Clamp, I like the Blood Franchise. Clearly, this show is a good example of why you shouldn&#039;t try to mix the two together. <br />
<br />
On a more positive note, I like the art. It&#039;s nothing spectacular or out of this world. If you enjoy works by Studio Clamp, you&#039;ll definitely enjoy the styling of the characters, with those big heads and elongated limbs! No, honestly. They look cute, it&#039;s a pity they couldn&#039;t have given them personalities at the same time. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s filled with blood, blood everywhere, which is fine but at the times I wish they would have taken a more subtle approach in some of the episodes. It might be called Blood but we can see that from the title, you don&#039;t have to go all out on us in every episode. The Blood Franchise is more than just a cheesy horror story, just look at Blood+ for an example. <br />
<br />
The monsters look ridiculous, stupid and not a single one of them shares anything in common with the others. I think this would have helped the series a lot if this matter had received just a little more attention. <br />
<br />
As I said before, if you don&#039;t buy the DvD release, you&#039;re stuck with the most horrible form of censorship imaginable after the first few episodes. Massive white bars that obscure most of the screen. What kind of garbage is this, Japan? Seriously. Don&#039;t censor your animé. That&#039;s one of the most appealing things about it. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t think much about the sound-track on a personal note but it does fit what&#039;s happening in the series, the background music is well chosen and helps to build up the atmosphere. I didn&#039;t really think much of the opening and ending songs, they were substandard and completely boring to watch or listen to, likely because the show itself has that effect on people. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say I enjoyed this series and that&#039;s rare for me. It does pick up during the last few episodes, more or less the last two, where the plot changes drastically and we have a few nice twists, but I&#039;d say they were executed much too late into the damned series. In a series like this, you can&#039;t just throw it all out at the last episode because nobodies going to want to watch it for that long. I also enjoyed a small cameo appearance of another one of my favorite Studio Clamp characters, but you&#039;ll have to figure out that one for yourself.<br />
<br />
Honestly. Just watch it if you have the time, and make a list of why it&#039;s a horrendous piece of magnificent stupidity. You&#039;ll have fun just doing that. It&#039;s always a good conversation topic for the forums too.

    WARNING: THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS THOUGH I WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THEM TO A MINIMUM!!!<br />
<br />
Also, I the first paragraph under each section was based on 3/12 episodes seen.  The second paragraph will be an update based on having seen the series in it&#039;s entirety.  I&#039;m just too lazy to actually write something brand new lol.  Anyways, On to the review...<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
The story has been weak for me and falls far short of expectations.  I was expecting something dark and similar to Blood+ in many ways but perhaps with a fresh twist, however, what I have seen thus far is basically

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39835">
        a high school slice-of-life drama with about 5 minutes at the end of every episode that give a slight nod to this series&#039; predecessor, Blood+.  I understand this a new series with an alternate take on the story but this pales in comparison to the previous version.  There has been little progression in the story other than through character development (the little that there has been anyways) and there hasn&#039;t been an explanation offered for these &quot;monsters&quot; that Saya keeps fighting despite already having seen 1/4 of the season.  The story just isn&#039;t entertaining and is convoluted and obscure.<br />
<br />
This hold true for about half of the season.  Then after episode 5 the series begins to become a little bit more action oriented but offers even less character development and zero plot progression as a result.  Then an entire seasons worth of plot, build-up and all, is dumped on the viewer in the final two episodes with the last being a gore-fest.  I understand what the story was aiming for and I even understand the approach that as attempted, but I felt the story was just crammed into two episodes at the end thus it rushed to me and failed on it&#039;s delivery.  SPOILER: Also,if this matters to you at all, even knowing there is going to be a movie next year, the series ends with information but no resolution.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
As far as the art design goes it&#039;s not bad and on par with other anime.  The animation itself is nothing spectacular with the exception of Saya&#039;s fight scenes.  Though a little too dark at times, the animation instantly improves and I will say that I am happy to see fluid sword movements in some scenes without excessive repetition.  Other than that, however, it is basic.  Not bad but not great.  The character designs are ok, though I must admit I am not that much of a fan of Saya.  The hair is just ridiculous for someone who has the responsibilities that she does.  Again, the previous Saya from Blood+ was far superior in this respect again.  Also, for supposedly being a high schooler, Yuuka Amino sure has the design of someone who just stepped out of the russian mafia.  I feel like she is drawn far older than her character is intended to be.<br />
<br />
As the series finished, I pretty much retained the feelings I had after episode three.  Bad character designs and great actions scenes.  Actually the latter became even better.  Especially in the last episode when Saya fights &quot;Thundercat&quot;.  You&#039;ll knw who this is when it happens.  And the ensuing fight scene is probably one of the best I&#039;ve seen in an anime in a very very long time.  The action is fast, almost &quot;what just happened&quot; fast, yet still clear.  The sword movements are swift and non-repetitive.  Overall, the action is the saving grace of this series from an artistic point and I can only hope the action style is incorporated into other anime in the future.<br />
<br />
Sound:6<br />
I am not an audiophile so for me I look for basic clarity and voices.  I can hear things clearly, so it passes my clarity test lol.  As far as the voice choices, I haven&#039;t adored any of them other than Misato Fukuen.  The voice actors are alright and don&#039;t take away from the story.<br />
<br />
This held true throughout the series.  An average score for average voice acting.<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
Here is the big one for me.  What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Saya.  She is beyond lacking common sense.  She is beyond ditzy even.  She is a whole new level of clueless that is shocking to even have to witness.  She has ZERO awareness as to what&#039;s going on around her unless it has to do with that dog, Tokizane, her father, or fighting.  It&#039;s painful to see a main protagonist be so absentminded she doesn&#039;t even realize that her friends, who are but five feet away from her, talk about her to her face, and then snap into battle mode in the remaining few minutes.  Also, I think that her adoration for her father is kind of odd.  It&#039;s a little too much daddy&#039;s girl for me.  Not that the show ever hints that the relationship is odd, which I think makes it even more odd since it was probably unintended.  The other characters fall flat and seem bland.  The saving grace to this show are the twins.  They are cute and funny.<br />
<br />
This is about the most interesting part of the series since so much happens in the last two episodes to either change perceptions or reaffirm suspicions.  Saya remains beyond ditzy and clueless till the last episode and everything else would spoil surprises so I will simply say that character development is still extremely slow and uninteresting.  It&#039;s hard to relate to characters and care about them when their personalities are so generic and underdeveloped.  However, the last two episodes change this.  For better or for worse is up to you.  For me,it made it interesting.  Most will probably just rage.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
At least the fight scenes are entertaining, despite the fact I have no clue what she is fighting or why.  Still, as stated above, this is where the animation picks up a bit.<br />
<br />
This hold true thought an explanation is given at some point.  The animation still remains the biggest plus for this series.  The fight scenes are good, even if they are a little sparse in the beginning.  I actually kind of like the &quot;twist&quot; at the end.  The deliver was a complete failure and thus this series will be rated very low on average but I like the attempt.  Again I understand the why, but it doesn&#039;t change the fact it failed.  <br />
<br />

    Sexy action heroine. Check. School life setting. Check. Gratuitous violence. Check. Monster of the week format. Check.<br />
<br />
So what went wrong here? <br />
<br />
Well first of all, there is a serious lack of plot progression in the first few episodes which IMO should be the most important of the story. The first few episodes are the &quot;hook&quot; that will make the audience decide whether they will watch the next episode or drop this show. The director and the writer failed at this part. Yes they made a decent 1st episode but the succeeding ones are almost carbon copy of the 1st one with minor variations. Example: Saya

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44947">
        eats her breakfast, goes to school, talks with friends, a random but vague hint/foreshadowing appears and then time to kill the monster of the day. The show basically wasted 3-4 episodes before getting to the interesting part of the story.<br />
<br />
Second. The story&#039;s pacing. The director and the writer purposely extended a rather simple story by dragging or adding scenes that doesn&#039;t necessarily contribute to the plot. Blood-C&#039;s story(including the upcoming movie) can fit in a 12 episode format with proper direction and storytelling. There is no doubt about it. <br />
<br />
Third. Incohesive story. Blood-C is a mystery story. The plot revolves around the &quot;truth&quot; about Saya, the monsters and the town. In order for a mystery story to work the writer must occasionally drop hints at the right time that will create interest or excitement to the story and at the same time reveal a part of the plot a little bit. The show failed at creating interest by hammering the audience with repetitious vague hints/flash backs. How many times have you heard of &quot;the contract&quot; or &quot;the promise that Saya made&quot;? Did it enlighten you a little bit when you heard those phrase or did it leave you clueless and confused? Only in the last few episodes have we learned about the truth. Was it satisfying? Maybe. Are there any audience left that will watch the &quot;explanatory&quot; episode? You know the answer.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed the action and maybe the fanservice but the story just bored me to death. So in conclusion, Blood-C is one of those anime that could have been something unique and interesting but end up bad.

    Being a fan of Blood+, I was completely disappointed by this spin-off series. <br />
<br />
The main character, Saya, is obscenely annoying, and pathetic. She is from a family of fighters, and destined for a dark and brutal fate, yet she STILL acts like an annoying, selfish, and naive brat.  <br />
<br />
There really is no plot development until the last few episodes (how many people had to die before that happened I wonder) <br />
<br />
There is no character development. (Sorry, the annoying, pathetic naive main character NEVER gets cooler. At all. Sorry.) <br />
<br />
The only thing satisfying thing in this series, is the amount of gore made from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186977">
        monsters attacking the humans (while our main character stands there dumbfounded while they tear people apart), if you are into gore and all that. It can get pretty disturbing. <br />
<br />
Overall this series sucks. Unless you are just in the mood to watch a bunch of ordinary innocent people die in disgustingly brutal ways, you probably won&#039;t enjoy it. At all.

    Blood-C is another installment to the famed Blood anime franchise. Re-envisioned by the prolific mangaka group CLAMP and animated by equally as respected studio Production I.G. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? Well, unfortunately it didn&#039;t turn out that way. Blood-C is unbearably slow, gratingly cryptic, and the epitome of mediocre writing. A real shame, because it certainly had potential to be good.<br />
<br />
First off, it&#039;s worth pointing out even though it is attached to an existing franchise, Blood-C doesn&#039;t connect to Blood: The Last Vampire or Blood+, besides the basic premise; as such it should be judged on its own merits rather than compared

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44489">
        to the other two works. That said, Blood-C fails all on its own.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Blood-C does have the makings of a good story. As with its predecessors, the story follows a sword-wielding girl named Saya, who hunts man-eating monsters. The big difference here is that this version of Saya is a bespectacled air-head (at least by first appearances) who lives in a small town and leads a normal life by day. Of course she is living a double-life, and by night she defends the town from the inhuman Elder Brains... or at least that what she thinks she&#039;s doing, because it becomes increasingly clearer (to the viewer) that things in Saya&#039;s quiet little town are not quite as they seem. Throughout the show Saya&#039;s life begins to unravel; the actions of those around her become increasingly suspicious to the viewer. At the same time, it is implied by an mysterious narrator that Saya is involved in some kind of twisted game. Mix this cryptic intrigue with the show&#039;s graphic violence, and you have what should have been a been an effective horror story.<br />
<br />
So, what goes wrong? Well, for one, the pacing is very bad. Yes, the show is supposed to be cryptic and mysterious, but even then it feels like it is just dragging on forever. Shows like Monster, Higurashi, Boogiepop Phantom are good examples of how deliberate pacing can keep the viewership on edge; Blood-C is not. The problem is, unlike the other examples I just gave, Blood-C has very little character or plot development until the last three episodes. This means most of its run time is spent on gristly battles (which are admittedly quite good), boring school-life scenes, and waving the mystery in the viewer&#039;s face while explaining nothing. Watching Saya have strange visions and collapse is captivating the first time around, but after the same thing happens four or more episodes in a row without even an inkling as to what any of this even means, it loses its edge. The story takes so long to reveal anything that by the time it does (in long tiresome exposition) the viewer simply doesn&#039;t care more.<br />
<br />
The problems with pacing could have been remedied by a good cast of characters, unfortunately, Blood-C has a distinct lack of that as well. In fact, the characters are likely the worse things about this show. Saya isn&#039;t a particularly interesting lead despite the mystery that surrounds her, because she lacks personality; really, she just doesn&#039;t stand out as far as female leads. Cafe manager Fumito, and to a lesser degree Saya&#039;s teacher Ms. Tsutsutori, are the closest any character gets to being genuinely interesting because they seem to be the ones who know the most through a majority of the show. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional dead ends, each defined by a single character trait (that&#039;s right, not even a set of character traits) such as the class rep having a crush on Saya, or Tokizane being a brooding loner; this is the laziest characterization imaginable. These characters are so weak that once the initial shock of seeing central characters getting killed off subsides, their deaths have little to no impact at all. Of course, the plot twist in episode 11 might inadvertently explain why the characterizations were so weak to that point, though this is probably more of an excuse than valid justification. However, even then the characters come off as one-dimensional with the shallowest of motivations.<br />
<br />
There is one thing that is high quality in Blood-C, its technical merits. CLAMP is well known for their unique visual style and Production I.G. for the high production value of its shows; Blood-C clearly benefits from the marriage of these two juggernauts of the anime world. Character designs are eye candy; Saya and her friends, heck all the characters in fact, are more attractive than most can ever hope to be. The monstrous Elder Brains are bizarrely eye-catching as well, each wonderfully imaginative in their distinctive (and often gruesome) appearances. Supporting the character designs is fluid animation courtesy of Production I.G., along with strong backgrounds, and very graphic violence and gore (as I can assume by the heavy censorship). The music is quality stuff; perfect for embodying the mysticism, mystery, and menace that envelops the show. Really, it is a shame the writing is not on par with the visuals and music; the show would have been good if it was.<br />
<br />
Blood-C really feels like potential wasted. It has what could have been the making of a great show; not to mention quality art and music. However, the sluggish pacing and the dirt poor characters ruin any chance the show had of being good. I can only hope that the movie sequel will fair better; at the very least Blood-C might be a marketing success... because regardless of how you feel about the show as a whole, the final episode will probably leave you wanting to watch the movie.<br />

    Blood-C is a badly executed anime with a good concept and a good story. There&#039;s no real developpement until the last episodes and that&#039;s why it&#039;s hard to appreciate. I think I liked it more because I watched it all in one go, it&#039;s a lot less painful that way. My other advice would be to watch the unscencored DVD and BD version because the gore is one of the most extreme in recent anime.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10 (8/10 with the ending)<br />
The story is almost non-existent until the last episodes, it&#039;s mostly atmosphere and events without clear context. It pays off in the end, because those &quot;useless&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49243">
        episodes have a purpose in the long run. The ending is the best part of the show and left me wanting more. I certainly cannot wait for the movie sequel to come out!<br />
<br />
Character (4.5/10)<br />
No real character developpement. It&#039;s only in the last episode that we see glimpse of interesting characters, but we&#039;re gonna wait for the movie to see more of them.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound (8.5/10)<br />
The art is from CLAMP and production IG kept it good till the end. The combat were brutal and incredibly bloody when it wasn&#039;t censored. The music is the best part. The soundtrack really gave emotions to scene that would have been bland.<br />
<br />
Conclusion 7/10<br />
All in all, it&#039;s a good story backed up by beautiful art and music. The pacing issues are really troublesome in the first 5 episodes. I highly recommend watching it in one go for a better enjoyment! This season felt like a 12 episodes trailer for an awesome movie. Count me hooked for Blood-C: The Last Dark.<br />
<br />
