    The good: You don&#039;t need to watch the first season to follow the story. <br />
<br />
The bad: The anime started with a score of 8.74 and ended with a 7.10.  If you watched the first season, you would feel a bit disappointed. Unlike the first season, this anime doesn&#039;t entertain because the story is weird and the pacing is average. For me, this anime is just an alternative story from the main series. <br />
<br />
Danmachi Sword Oratoria centers the story in Aiz Wallenstein, the sword princess. Sadly, even if Aiz is the main character, there isn&#039;t too much information about her past just some sporadic scenes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251584">
        and the plot centers on her desire of getting stronger. During her adventure into the dungeons, she fought with a person that could know more about her past, and she decides to go into the lower dungeon levels to find the truth. The plot has pacing problems and lacks more information to keep us entertained. <br />
<br />
While this anime follows the main idea of the Danmachi series, I feel that something is missing. Perhaps some characters aren&#039;t well developed and annoying to the point that we could get bored of them. The introduction of some characters is forced or useless, and there isn&#039;t enough time to develop their personalities fluently. Maybe the novel is different.  <br />
<br />
The art is standard. Honestly, I was expecting to be better than the first season, but I can say, it is the same. <br />
<br />
About the songs, the OP is nice, and the ED is passable. The sound mix is good and focuses on the fights details. <br />
<br />
Finally, nothing is concluded, and nothing about Aiz is told, so in other words, the story failed to deliver any reasonable conclusion, it ends abruptly. It was just a promotion for the novel, buy it to find the truth.<br />
<br />
Maybe you will enjoy it more if you haven&#039;t watched the first season. If you are a fan of the first season, do not expect too much from this or you will get upset, it is just a spin-off.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Sword Oratoria... the spinoff, not second season, of the beloved DanMachi series. This time around, we&#039;re going to see the same story from Ais WallenWhatsit&#039;s point of view, at least, that&#039;s what I thought was going to happen...<br />
<br />
Story: In the first, or at least first few episodes, it should be clear that this is in fact the same story of DanMachi. However, instead of focusing on The Misadventures of Bell Cranel, we get to see a different side of things. This spinoff focuses mainly on the cast of the Loki Familia. Yes, the Loki Familia, not just Ais, which is very important to know.<br />
 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251644">
           Originality: 0/1. I mean, come on now. It&#039;s like the author suddenly had second thoughts about the original story and how basic it was, so he created this spinoff to add a deeper meaning to everything, just centered around Ais&#039; character. <br />
      Potential: 2/2 Although reusing the same story, I&#039;d say this had a lot of potential. It&#039;s kind of an interesting thing to see the same events occur from another character&#039;s perspective; especially the one (Ais) who has the biggest influence over our DanMachi protagonist. <br />
      Execution: 3/7 :<br />
-One of the biggest problems I think this show had was pacing. The first few episodes were a complete drag, and I felt like I was forcing my way through them. The only highlights of the first couple episodes were the moments when Ais came into contact with Bell. Having a slow introduction can really put a damper on the overall feeling of a series, especially one that only spans twelve episodes. I honestly didn&#039;t even somewhat enjoy an episode until we got to episode four. 3/12 is a fourth of the series. Not a very good start. <br />
-I&#039;d say this show really missed it&#039;s chance to focus on Ais as the main character. Hopping from her to Lefiya as a protagonist really put a damper on the story. Ais is a big part of the story, but the amount of screen time she missed out on was a sin. <br />
-Another problem I had with this series that is a recurring issue from the original was the excessive amounts of fanservice shoved in my face. If Hestia wasn&#039;t your cup of tea, then Lefiya might make you drop the series all together. Her &quot;fantasies&quot; that I&#039;m sure were supposed to be comedic were way over-the-top and completely unnecessary. <br />
- The final episode made zero sense if you have any recollection of the original series and the order events played out. I&#039;m not going to spoil anything, but there was an event that should have happened but didn&#039;t which was somewhat aggravating.<br />
+ Even amidst all of these negatives, there were some positives. The moments that Ais came into to contact with Bell were just precious, as we got to see a different side to Ais than even Bell got to see. This was exactly what I was hoping for from the series, and I was just a bit sad there wasn&#039;t more of it.<br />
+ The moments the series actually chose to intertwine Ais and the overall story were done pretty well. The motivation for Ais to become stronger is revealed. Best of all, we get to actually see the Sword Princess struggle with some of her battles. <br />
Story overall score: 5/10. Although it wasn&#039;t very original, I&#039;d say it had a lot of potential. It just chose to execute it in a way that wasn&#039;t exceedingly interesting. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
     Animation: 2/5. A pretty obvious step down from the original series. The fight scenes seemed far less intense. Their movements were sometimes rough. I mean, seriously. If the best animated scene from the series was taken directly from the original series, we have a problem. <br />
      Art: 3/5 A serious downgrade, once again, from it&#039;s predecessor. The setting and scenery were fine. Nothing spectacular. In the scenes with less action the characters were occasionally drawn very sloppily, and it was pretty noticeable Nothing great overall, which is a shame because the first season had fairly decent art and animation. <br />
Art score overall: 5/10 Obvious short cuts were taken, but some scenes were pleasing to look at. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
     Opening: 1/3. It&#039;s a pretty skip-able opening. Nothing spectacular, certainly nothing I&#039;d want to listen to on it&#039;s own. It wasn&#039;t an opening that got me excited to watch the episode at all, although I guess it was an okay opening for a fantasy genre show. <br />
     Ending: 0/2. This ending was just bad. Not only was it entirely skip-able, but it didn&#039;t even make me want to watch the next episode or convey the tone or mood of the show accurately at all. <br />
      OST: 2/3. The original soundtrack wasn&#039;t anything particularly special. It had common fantasy instrumentals (you know the ones). There was one track that caught my attention, surprisingly, although it still wasn&#039;t anything I&#039;d listen to out of context. The rest of the soundtrack did a decent job of conveying setting and the mood and/or tone of the occurring events. Not a lot of complaints here.<br />
      Voice: 1/2 The voice actors of the main characters were pretty meh. Lefiya&#039;s voice was rather annoying and didn&#039;t really portray emotions well at all. Ais&#039; actor was alright, but I feel like she didn&#039;t really conform to the character well enough. Side character voices were decent all around. I&#039;m a fan of Bete&#039;s VA, and Finn&#039;s wasn&#039;t too shabby, either. <br />
Sound score overall: 4/10. Nothing spectacular at all, not that I really expected much. The OST was by far the best part for me. <br />
<br />
Character: Oh my, here we go. Buckle in, boys and girls, we&#039;re going on a bumpy ride. <br />
     Design: 2/2. Not really any complaints here. Their designs are typical fantasy setting, and they&#039;re easy to tell apart. <br />
     Enjoyable: 1/3. I did not really care for most of the members of the Loki Familia. I did enjoy watching Ais, Finn, and Bete, but that&#039;s unfortunately it. Lefiya might be one of the most annoying characters I have ever come across. I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes whenever she came on screen. No, that&#039;s not an exaggeration. She was that bad. At least the moments with Bell and Ais were fun to rewatch, as were the moments when Ais was fighting. Otherwise, the remaining characters were mostly boring. Although, I have to give it up to that perverted Goddess, Loki. I did enjoy the scenes where she actual showed that she was a pretty cunning woman. <br />
      Development: 1/5. <br />
Shall we break down why?<br />
-Lefiya: Oh, hello there Bell 2.0. Lefiya is literally the &quot;Can I copy your homework?&quot; meme. I mean, not that another Bell would be particularly terrible, but she was just so much worse. Honestly, combine Bell and Hestia and add in zero character development and an exceedingly annoying personality and voice. There. That&#039;s Lefiya. Perhaps the worst choice of a main character they possibly could have picked. I can&#039;t even remember if she was in the first season or not. Not to mention the most annoying aspect of her: It&#039;s stated that she&#039;s already has the power of a Level 3 Adventurer, but she&#039;s /too scared to do anything/ on the battlefield.<br />
-Ais: The only reason this got a measly point. I was so glad Ais got at least a tiny bit of character development. Like I&#039;ve stated previously, the amount of screen time she got was a sin considering I thought this entire season was going to be following her story. But we got her motivation to become stronger, we saw some fights where she did struggle and wasn&#039;t some OP God being, and best of all we get to see that she seems almost somewhat envious of Bell (who is developing so quickly). We see the reason as to why she agreed to train him in the first place, and that he&#039;s actually motivating her at the same time. Still no drastic changes in character, but it was a start.<br />
-The rest of the cast: Not really any development here. Tiona and Tione were pretty static the entire way through. Although Bete, Finn, and Riveria were enjoyable to watch, they didn&#039;t change much, either. I will mention Filvis,though. As a new character introduced in this series, I found her pretty interesting and she did get some development. Still, not much.<br />
Overall character score: 4/10. Even though they have decent designs, over half of the characters were not even enjoyable to watch, and this series was seriously lacking in the character development department <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5.5/10. Despite there being countless flaws to this spinoff, I did kind of enjoy it. If I hadn&#039;t watched the original series I definitely would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10. Although this series can be watched on it&#039;s own, if you haven&#039;t seen DanMachi, you&#039;ll probably enjoy this even less than I did. If you didn&#039;t like the original season, definitely steer clear. However, if you&#039;re an avid fan of DanMachi and are eagerly awaiting a true second season, I&#039;d say you should watch it. It gives a different perspective and a deeper story to the events that occurred in the first season. I haven&#039;t read the Manga, so I&#039;m not sure if the storyline here will be necessary to know if we ever do get a true second season, but if you&#039;re a fan of Ais WallenWhatsit, you&#039;d probably enjoy this show at least as much as I did. Keep in mind that the latter six episodes are much better than the first six. Or, more enjoyable, at least. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading~<br />

    Honestly I really like Danmachi season 1 featuring Belle. Im pretty sure all of you did. But this is my personal opinion and I really dislike lefiya, just overall the way she acts the useless ways she is portrayed kinda pisses me off. When i first saw the release date for the new Danmachi I was really excited for a season 2 of one off my favorite fantasy animes, but when i realized that this was from the point of view of Ais I was kind of dissapointed. Im pretty sure alot you wanted to see a development in a season 2 where we are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247290">
        able to see Bell the main hero to progress further, but even with that in mind i was fine with having a season 2. But after watching the first episode and encountering one of the &quot;main&quot; characters Lefiya I immediately started to realize how FUCKING ANNOYING she was. The story was alright and the fact we got to see Dan machi from Ais&#039;s view was ok, but the characters really threw me off this season.

    if you liked Danmanchi you probably still won&#039;t like this. The story isn&#039;t important because it&#039;s the same thing every episode. the main character gets herself stuck in a precarious situation and gets saved by the amazing Aiz Wallenstein. the main because so indebted and obsessed with Aiz she follows her around everywhere she goes and buys her stuff regardless of how rare or expensive because the sword princess is that important. the plot armour is tolerable at least as we get into fights the viewer doesn&#039;t really care about each episode.<br />
<br />
the art is ok. I mean it has to be if it&#039;s mostly fighting.<br />
<br />
the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247662">
        sound is also ok  but nothing to praise.<br />
<br />
the characters are either garbage or annoying. we have the great Aiz Wallenstein the girl with no personality yet everyone loves her. she is only good for fighting as she throws herself into fights even when told not to. we have our main character Lefiya which follows Aiz around like a lost puppy as she is weak and hopeless on the battlefield but don&#039;t worry like previous main character bell she has something special about her and has a ton of untapped potential.  who cares about the rest of the characters, they&#039;re side characters they can&#039;t be much better.<br />
<br />
overall i give this show a 3/10. crap characters, crap story but good fight scenes (that&#039;s all it has going for it). things look like they might change pace next episode but they probably won&#039;t. unless you&#039;re a completionist or someone who just a good fight skip it. and danmachi fans unless you like Aiz (i don&#039;t know why you would) you&#039;re not going to learn anything you care about.

    Is a spinoff of Danmachi with an alternative view focusing on Aiz, one of (for LA at least) the least interesting harem members to be given a spinoff series a good idea?.<br />
<br />
&lt;LA breathes in&gt;...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria is an interesting yet odd spinoff from the many many MANY sequels and spinoffs anime to come out of Spring 2017. LA wasn&#039;t exactly clamoring for a spinoff based on Aiz as LA is one of those fans of Danmachi wanting just more from Bell and Hestia than to Aiz though this spinoff looking at an alternative view of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251628">
        how events occurred in the original is a nice touch in a ways.<br />
<br />
&lt;LA breathes in&gt;...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria&#039;s characterization is focused towards Aiz as well as Lefiya Viridis voiced by Juri Kimura a fangirl of Aiz, though Lefiya is more as a similar Bell but with a similar motive of wanting to protect others by leveling up in this case trying to catch up to Aiz as well as worshiping her. Aiz on the other hand has character development in terms of her backstory and how this links to the major villain of this spinoff. This at least is interesting and gives us depth to one of the least interesting harem member of Danmachi. Aside from that, other characters are typical supporting characters with some personality to them as well as fleshing out the Loki Familia as a Guild from Bete Loga voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto the hair-tempered berserker, Tiona Hiryute voiced by Rie Murakawa and Tione Hiryute voiced by Minami Takahashi, Riveria Ljos Alf voiced by Ayako Kawasumi and Loki voiced by Yurika Kubo the perverted leader of the Familia, which by the end of it, the majority of the supporting characters got fleshed out better than Lefiya did, especially showing us that Bete isn&#039;t the asshole jerk character or showing the Hiryute twins and especially Riveria a glass cannon badass mage and LA&#039;s favourite character in Sword Oratoria. <br />
<br />
Now because this spinoff is having plot beats following the original, this spinoff does have some new material, that one being an interesting plotline that involves Aiz and the major villain, her plans and is probably the only interesting plotline to all the new things Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria does as it integrates both the Gods and behind the scene dealings to connecting to Aiz&#039;s past and her dilemma about being a powerful swordswomen and what her connection to this plotline has on her. The rest of the plot elements especially the slice of life are kinda a bore to constant running gag annoyance with fanservice moments any chance it gets and is just a guise for the build up and hinting to the plans of the major villain is focusing on, something even it&#039;s original somehow did quite well (albeit the original&#039;s major villain never springs into action or goes anywhere as it&#039;s a more focused look at Bell&#039;s progression to be a better adventurer, where in this spinoff, the major villain is a HUGE focus and takes a somewhat more serious take compared to the original). <br />
<br />
Probably one of the biggest gripes Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria does is on Lefiya as a character, at first she&#039;s the fangirl wanting to be like Aiz and is a shy one at that, but by the end of the anime, she becomes a vindictive psycho lesbian wanting Aiz all to herself (slight exaggeration but the anime frames Lefiya like this and it crosses the line out of comedic effect) and sees Bell as competition. Either way, Lefiya&#039;s portrayal at first was pretty good and especially when revealed she like Bell is a pretty powerful magic user under that timid nature, but due to her static nature and never evolving or developing outside of these traits, she becomes a character LA would not root for or care one iota about. The only other character annoyance comes from Loki who does the entire yuri groping thing to Aiz or any big-breasted woman -sigh-. The only other lacking aspect Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria doesn&#039;t have compared to the original is the aforementioned slice of life moments that feels more like build up than progressing with the plot, to it&#039;s defense due to this plot simultaneously coinciding with it&#039;s original, it&#039;s kinda hard to add good flow to the plot when it needs to abide by it&#039;s original series but then LA can counter it by saying it turns into chess piece story telling with &quot;some&quot; substance to it and by LA sees by this later down the anime aside from a few new character development from Filvis Challia voiced by Hisako Kanemoto and Lulune Louie voiced by Hikaru Akao and a bit of world-building through Loki, it&#039;s chess piece storytelling using the original series as it&#039;s crux and the major villain egging Aiz on to be stronger or go here or there doesn&#039;t help.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the animation overall is ok enough though there are some dips in quality at times and although the anime is rehashing moments from it&#039;s original, LA is glad they just didn&#039;t copy and pasted it just like that and given us differing perspective of certain events. The battles once again are a standout but again also takes dips in quality at times to. The character designs are polished to a certain level of detail and has the detail to be similar to it&#039;s original, typical of a spinoff in a ways, LA isn&#039;t complaining. Overall, the animation is ok enough for LA to neither rage or a praiseworthy mention about.<br />
<br />
In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is typical fare only with the hugely expanded voice cast. Saori Oonishi as the stoic emotionless Aiz is meh in LA&#039;s opinion but she &quot;tries&quot;. Juri Kimura, well LA is gonna compare her to Satomi Arai as Kuroko and say that she&#039;s not as bad, but she can get annoying when in obsessive fangirl mode and here&#039;s the thing, LA actually enjoyed Satomi Arai as Kuroko even at her worst of times, Juri Kimura as Lefiya has her annoying moments but LA is more or less projecting with this criticism. But once again, like the animation it&#039;s ok enough for LA to neither rage (a bit) or praise about. LA&#039;s favourite voice actors would go to Rie Murakawa and Minami Takahashi as the Hiryute twins AS well as Ayako Kawasumi as Riveria.<br />
<br />
So Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria has a few problems with it&#039;s plot beats, some character annoyances and annoying fanserviced slice of life moments but does that mean even with it&#039;s saving graces of an interesting yet serious plotline and alternative look at similar events from the original means it&#039;s a good spinoff???...for that LA says that this spinoff is an interesting case of trying to be like it&#039;s original while at the same time whistling to a different tune, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria is that it&#039;s not great but it&#039;s not bad either as it expands the world building of Danmachi, however if comparing to it&#039;s original, it feels a bit of a step back from it&#039;s original series, not from it&#039;s differing atmosphere and characters as even atmosphere had times where it fitted into the serious nature of the major plotline of the major villain of this spinoff and certain outside of Lefiya like Filvis, Bete and Riveria got their limelight moments but because it&#039;s trying to emulate it&#039;s original while doing something completely different instead and it does work to an extent but it&#039;s blunt execution of chess piece storytelling deterred LA from liking this spinoff as much as LA wanted to.<br />
<br />
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria, your not a bad or horrible of a spinoff but your definitely one of the more unremarkable spinoffs LA has seen.

    TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d like to preface this review with saying I general don&#039;t review sequels or side stories, because you&#039;ll find me usually saying it was as enjoyable, slightly less enjoyable, or slightly more enjoyable than the first or original story. This show has forced me to turn it into an exception.<br />
<br />
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria (which is a goddamn mouthful), better known as DanMachi: Sword Oratoria, is a spin-off side-story that shows the main story but from a different perspective. Who&#039;s perspective?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251690">
        The Loki Familia&#039;s, but more importantly from Ais&#039; perspective.<br />
<br />
The entire idea of the show started out well, being able to see things from how Ais saw them, but it very quickly degraded into watching Lefiya be the worst tsunyuri girl ever, every episode. For one reason or another, they thought Lefiya&#039;s &quot;I have great potential but currently am fucking useless&quot; mixed with &quot;I love and look up to the girl that&#039;s my senior/hero&quot; was going to end up with a good character. They could not have done worse with her. The constant naivete coming from Lefiya, the constant whining, the constant not being able to do anything remotely useful (until the very end), and the constant frustration that she gave me as a viewer was just horrendous. She alone destroyed the fun that this show could&#039;ve given me.<br />
<br />
On the topic of characters other than Lefiya who is probably one of the worst this year alone, every other character has the emotion or depth of a fucking brick, which is painfully tough and flat as an airway run strip. Ais continually acts like a robot whilst showing very little emotion, the twins are just there to be supporting characters and don&#039;t ever break that trend, Bete is an angry dick, and the three seniors are all very stiff. Loki probably portrays the most emotion, going from trying to cop a feel on anybody, to somewhat serious on certain matters. The best part of this show was seeing Bell and Hestia, which is just painfully ironic in this scenario.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Ais and the Loki Familia and how Ais goes from being mistaken as her mother to some darker things that may bring the world to ruin. Or something like that. The story in all actuality was less important than they made the character interactions out to be, and those as previously mentioned was like watching paint dry for 12 weeks. Other than some new characters that you can only see through Ais&#039;s perspective, Sword Oratoria was made out to be far darker than the original story from Bell. This didn&#039;t play out well because the original story did well as a lighthearted fantasy/adventure show. The story was like watching an extremely convoluted game of Clue with DanMachi characters, and then some fighting instead of guessing who the killer is.<br />
<br />
One of the redeeming features of Sword Oratoria was that the art and animation were at least somewhat pleasing to look at in some situations. Some fight scenes were nicely done, some nice screenshots to be taken, but it never went up and beyond the &quot;average&quot; level that it had maintained through 12 episodes. The soundtrack was so laughably forgettable that I can&#039;t even really make a remark on it anymore in terms of whether it was good or not. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: DanMachi: Sword Oratoria is a waste of 12 episodes that could&#039;ve been put towards making a second season instead. All you&#039;ll get from this is how much you realize Bell and Hestia were the best part of DanMachi, and how the characters in this are painful to watch. I would not recommend this unless you really don&#039;t mind how awful the character and story are.<br />
<br />
<br />

    DanMach Gaiden - Sword Oratoria is a japanese anime produced by studio J.C. Staff and is based on a Light Novel of the same title.<br />
<br />
This is a side story of the original DanMachi, and this review will contain comparisons from the original show, meaning that I presume the reader has watched it.<br />
<br />
Story: 5<br />
The story revolves around... What does the story really revolve around? Our original thoughts about the show was that it would be about Aiz and see things from her perspective, but this is not true for the most part. <br />
We instead follow an array of characters through an array of events, and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247347">
        of them are the exact same events and frames that were used in the original. <br />
The show can basically be summarized into 5 points:<br />
&quot;The main plot&quot; being something mysterious with wild plant monsters.<br />
Aiz&#039; backstory or something similar.<br />
Lefiya getting stronger mentally.<br />
Shared frames to original to show where the show is on the timeline.<br />
Fanservice.<br />
The first 3 are obviously the main plot, while the second 2 are pretty much filler material.<br />
Nothing stands out as exceptional, and quite a bit of it is low quality.<br />
<br />
Art+Animation 5<br />
The animation in this show is pretty generic, ranging from character design to monsters and ambience. While it&#039;s not terrible in any way, it&#039;s definitely not good, and this is year 2017 - if the animation is bad, other parts DEFINITELY have to make up for it. Onihei is a decent example for this.<br />
If anything, the art has declined from the original, pointing at a question: Is the budget for this show lower than for the original one?<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The sound is pretty similar to the art/animation. There are no impressive OSTs, and the OP/ED are both quite bland. There is nothing wrong with character voices, the characters are just not interesting enough to really be able to call it more than decent.<br />
I have to lower the score a bit more due to how badly composed the OSTs are, especially in and between fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Character: 4<br />
Here&#039;s a core problem of the show. The original story had most of our current &quot;main crew&quot; as situational SUPPORT characters who showed up in a couple episodes. The only above average characters we currently have are Aiz and Loki, but since they don&#039;t receive the screentime of a &quot;real MC&quot;, they don&#039;t pave the path for this show either.<br />
The design for our &quot;main crew&quot; is very fitting for the word support characters. Lefiya (MC?) is a completely useless character who will probably save the day in a future episode, the problem is that: Bell Cranel from S1 had the vibes and screentime of a REAL MC even if he wasn&#039;t too great. Lefiya does NOT have any of these traits, and feels more like a target for future plot armor. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5<br />
I would originally have posted a worse score here, but the last part of Ep4 caught me slightly by surprise, I will have to keep looking and see if they progress it into something good.<br />
1 good or interesting scene is not enough to instantly sway me on my score, especially since EVERY SINGLE SCENE prior to this has been low in quality.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.8<br />
Although the overall score definitely does not add up to the other numbers, this is the &quot;value&quot; of this show if compared to other scores on MAL.<br />
The show definitely beats everything around 5-6.5, which means that giving it a ranking according to my scores for its&#039; attributes would be unfair. It would also be unfair to give this show higher rankings for its&#039; content than it deserves, thus I only raised the overall ranking.<br />
<br />
Is it worth a watch? I don&#039;t know yet. <br />
Should I watch this if I haven&#039;t watched the original? - I believe the original beats this in quality, so watch that INSTEAD.<br />
Will update this review at 8/12 episodes.<br />

    I originally didn&#039;t want to watch this series after I realized it wasn&#039;t actually the second season of one of my favourite fantasy animes. But I gave it a chance, and I&#039;m sure glad I did. Let me quickly tell you why.<br />

This anime follows Ais&#039; story, which goes on in the same time period as the first DanMachi series. It isn&#039;t a retelling of the first DanMachi and it isn&#039;t the continuation. It&#039;s something new (story-wise) but familiar (setting-wise/the big picture). It ended up providing valuable information to flesh out some characters that weren&#039;t explored too in-depth in the first DanMachi, and giving a new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252013">
        viewpoint on the same oncoming disaster that was hinted at in the first DanMachi. Even if you had regarded this anime as a stand-alone, it is really good and really interesting. <br />
<br />
Like in the first DanMachi, this anime has a well developed plot—good pacing, good foreshadowing, and it effectively shares information (about events, characters, etc) without it seeming fake or boring. In this way, characters are developed naturally. And about the art—of course, it is a favourite aspect of mine (I love DanMachi art). <br />
<br />
Overall, it was really fun to see Ais&#039; perspective and to learn about where she came from and to watch her develop. She became more than that beautiful human doll I was introduced to in the first DanMachi.<br />
<br />
In essence, I recommend watching this show—especially if you liked the first DanMachi. Even as a stand-alone (like I said) it&#039;s a great show.

    Better wait for the return of Belle and company. <br />
Aiz is a boring character to be the main in a complete season. <br />
It doesn&#039;t matter the amount of fanservice that is forced upon the viewer, it won&#039;t compensate the lack of character development and plot. <br />
The Loki Familia are a really boring cast to root for, since they&#039;re supposed to be one of the strongest Families in the series, there&#039;s no hardships for them to endure.<br />
The only glimpses of hope for this side story, are the scarce moments when it entwines with the main story, but since this moments where already shown in the first

If you like the first season, YOU WON&#039;T ENJOY THIS BORING SIDE STORY. <br />

    This is my first review and I&#039;ll keep it simple.<br />
<br />
This anime is a chore to watch. The only reason I find myself watching this anime is in the hope that I&#039;ll find a scene with Bell from a different perspective.<br />
<br />
The art work is much the same as the first season and the sound is fine as well. However, what really ruins this anime is the story and the characters. The story so far is lacklustre and cliché, the usual; some bad guy doing something bad. But the characters are incredibly annoying. The main character Lefiya is constantly whining and following Ais around like a lap

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249179">
        dog, she continues wanting to become stronger, to not to let her group down but every episode she is constantly screwing up and being saved. The rest of the characters have little depth and Ais is much the same in the first season however she gets much more screen time but still lacks any development.<br />
<br />
To summarise, DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME. It&#039;s a waste of time, extremely hard to enjoy and lacks the charm of the first season. Even if the anime succeeds in gaining a third season, as this is a prequel, I doubt it will impact your understanding or enjoyment of the next season.<br />

    So i started this series not all that excited after seeing the first one. While i thought the first one was fun and all it just couldn&#039;t get my attention that much.  But overall i did enjoy the first season and gave it a pretty good review besides the fact of it having an OP character and almost up to terms of what could be called a harem <br />
<br />
This is kind of the same season kind of holds the same opinion as the first one. <br />
While in my opinion overall better than the first season it was kind of hard to keep my attention.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258331">
        It doesn&#039;t really suffer from the same problems as the first and i&#039;ll get into the problems in a minute.<br />
<br />
~~ Spoilers ~~<br />
<br />
Gonna try to keep away from the actual story<br />
<br />
Lefiya: First let me start out by saying that for some weird and unknown reason instead of having the entire story be focused on Ais and herself. The story decided to add a new character named Lefiya. She is a very not needed character. Because she is in this we now have two main character Ais and Lefiya. <br />
<br />
 Lefiya isn&#039;t a bad character in my opinion. But she is more of a side character that is in the main character group. All throughout the entire series she has a crush on Ais. This in it&#039;s self isn&#039;t bad idea but the way they did it was not good. A lot of the time she can come off as annoying as she fantasizes over the two of them going out. Overall she doesn&#039;t add anything to the plot and takes up space that we the audience would rather be spent on Ais.<br />
<br />
Ais: Had really always been the most interesting character from the start. So when i found out she had her own season with her as the main character in the story. Too the stories credit it does give a good story and everything too Ais. I wish that the story focused more on her. But overall it was fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something that always bugged me in the first season it had always bugged me that Bell ( MC ) Is super powerful and has these amazing skills never before seen. The entire time i was wanting him to not reach his goal of reaching the power level of Ais. I felt like it would be more interesting for Bell too find out that not everything can happen like he wants. Thankfully in this it kind of elevated my frustration with that. It shows that Ais is still more powerful and is likely to get more powerful and stay like that.<br />
<br />
Something else that bugged me of the first season was that there was signs of it becoming a harem. Harems are a cancer to stories and annoying. Through out the first season it at times seemed like Ais would be in the Harem. But in this Ais doesn&#039;t even seem interested in him. She seem&#039;s more interested in being more powerful and spending time with her friends. <br />
<br />
<br />
~~ SPOILERS OVER~~<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end this was something i enjoyed more than the original  even with it&#039;s flaws. Would recommend watching the first season first than this but it&#039;s not needed.

    This chalks up to a typical spin-off that takes everything great about the original, and strips it away. With a character cast almost exclusively girls of every archetype with fan service galore, you can imagine what little this has to offer.<br />
<br />
The story is fairly 2 dimensional, a single path &quot;who done it&quot; quest with the usual disposable bad guys and the usual good girls wearing iron plot armor. There is little to like that other animes do far better, including this shows prequel. There&#039;s little challenge to the main characters who are unapologetically over powered, but as with the bewbs, what else would be better

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314366">
        but a power fantasy? <br />
<br />
But, it cant be denied that the animation and sound itself is good, but it&#039;s just good, its not great or awe inspiring, nor is the music. <br />
<br />
Unless you&#039;re watching to follow on from the first season, this is a pass.

    Personally, I found this anime to be good overall, it gives the viewer a greater insight into many of the characters introduced in Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka of the Loki Familia and most importantly develops Ais as a character, helping the viewer to understand her highly introvert nature.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of epic moments as well, with ambient sound and build-up music and following not one but two female protagonists provide a nice fresh change of pace.<br />
<br />
Having said that the key floor I find to be in this animation is not revolving around our heroes of the story but instead

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313658">
        the villains. For me the antagonists were dull, poorly explained and left me rather confused so whilst the action scenes themselves were good, I did feel a little disappointed by the motives of the enemy.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I enjoyed it overall.<br />
<br />
Good anime. (7)

    unlike the first season, this episodes is barely enjoyable the first episodes was amazing but the final episodes were extremely boring <br />
I hate that useless elf with her stupid voice is just pieced me off I didn&#039;t come here to watch that I come here to finish the story but they force you to watch this crap because they think is cute to me she is not, she is extremely annoying shit brat lesbian crap <br />
<br />
however here you can understand the other part of the story, what&#039;s the other team &quot;Loki family&quot; was doing while bell do his daily things you can escape a few

    I would like to state in my review more reasons why the anime is worth watching because, from what I see until now, it is a bit underrated and very criticized. <br />
<br />
I started watching Sword Oratoria after I saw the original DanMachi, and to my surprise the stories aren&#039;t related at all, even though you might see the two story lines intertwining here and there. This anime is focused not only on Ais but the whole Loki Familia, it has many new characters and it provides a different point of view on an adventurer&#039;s life. <br />
The plot is pretty good, it has a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248905">
        mysteries in it and it&#039;s quite unpredictable, since at this point I can&#039;t really figure out how the whole thing is going to end and who&#039;s on the good side, and who&#039;s with the bad guys. It also has plenty of action, to be honest I wouldn&#039;t mind more fighting scenes but it&#039;s not boring + if there&#039;s no action, it means you get some fanservice. <br />
<br />
The animation style is pretty similar to the original DanMachi. If you liked that one, you&#039;ll like this one too. In my opinion the animation is simple, there&#039;s nothing special or unique about it that could draw your attention. It&#039;s not bad either but it could be better.<br />
<br />
The sound is ok, like I mentioned about the animation too, it&#039;s plain, not special, nor annoying.<br />
<br />
The worst part about this anime is that the characters (up to this point) do not show any evolution. In the 1st one you could have seen Bell growing and becoming stronger but here there&#039;s nothing. No one really improves, they just reveal stuff about each other and about their past and what made them become who they really are. However, it&#039;s interesting to see things from Ais&#039; point of view, personally I find her quite interesting and there are some things from the original series that make more sense now, after understanding how she thinks and how the Loki Familia works together. Plus, I have the impression that the antagonist in this anime might be constructed better than the main character and we don&#039;t get to see this often.<br />
<br />
Overall it is an enjoyable anime. I will definitely continue watching it until it ends. It isn&#039;t as good as the first one but it has enough good points that make it worth watching!<br />

    This is a alternate story line, I repeat this is not a season 2 of the show. Although season 2 will be coming out soon. Don&#039;t expect this to be as comical as the first season either, it has a more serious tone to it (should&#039;ve read the genres).<br />
<br />
This is backstory for the &quot;Sword Princess&quot; or better known as Ais, it offers her day to day interactions with her familia and how she also meets Bell in her point of view and what she thinks of him. The story also revolves around another character not given a lot of screen time in the main series,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280996">
        Lafiya, to me personally comes off as annoying and useless, she also has a lesbian side to her when she talks to or about Ais she seems a little too fond of her. This season was meant to capitalize on the character development needed for many of the supporting characters from the first season, Ais is a quiet person who doesn&#039;t talk much, and is bad at expressing her feelings through words and often , comes off as dull for the most part. Lafiya was barely even mentioned, and her interactions did seem pretty random but this side story really helped explain the trouble that seemed to revolve around Ais. It also makes you appreciate the side characters much more.<br />
<br />
Story: 7 The story was weak compared to the main stories, it was a little all over the place, but it did offer explanations the main story didn&#039;t and had a nice pacing<br />
<br />
Art: 8 Well done like the first season<br />
<br />
Sound: 7 I watched the dub and very much enjoyed the voice actors chosen, the music was also pretty good<br />
<br />
Character: 8 This side story offered a lot of character development that the main story didn&#039;t, and offered a new perspective of the importance of the supporting characters<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3 I knew this wasn&#039;t a season 2 of the show but I was expecting it to have the comedic side which is what made me really enjoy the first season, and I thought I would see Bell a lot more too, the show was too serious for my taste, and even in the parts that were supposed to be funny I didn&#039;t even laugh all that much<br />
<br />
Overall 6.6 but we&#039;ll round it to a 7

    Never forget your roots as they say and its very clear Sword Oratoria has not forgotten its.<br />
<br />
This show was very slow to start with a character that i detested in the beginning but its one of those that takes those preconceived notions and does a complete 180. By about episode six or seven this show goes from a slow side story of Danmachi to damn whirlwind of fight scenes and good character moments. We get some great scenes of characters old and new and by the end i have a show here that initially i would&#039;ve given a five or six now i&#039;m gonna give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271700">
        an eight.<br />
Lefiya redeems herself in my eyes and becomes a lead i can enjoy watching. And i do love how for a few episodes they do take the perspective away from her and more onto Aiz showing that this spinoff is not specifically about Lefiya. It&#039;s about Loki Familia as a whole and developing many of them. That is an aspect that i love so much.<br />
Also FUCKING DRAGONS ON FLOOR 58 DAMN I BETTER SEE BELL FIGHT THOSE ONE DAY CUZ FUCK THAT WAS SWEET<br />
Anyway 8/10 for this one.<br />
The latter half blew away my expectations. <br />
I love this series with a passion and i&#039;m gonna grab the next novels of Sword Oratoria when i get the chance.

    This anime further expands the danmachi universe and that is good. The only thing I don&#039;t like about this season is the elf who is a fan of the swordsman. By God infumable for 8 chapters later more or less you can put up with it but it is so useless that it disgusts you just to see it. The animation very well like the first season after except for the elf cover, all the co-stars very good. A very good story to enhance the very well done main story. The soundtrack reminded me of K-On, so I don&#039;t know if they are related there,

        the same band made them some songs but the singer sounds familiar to me. If you saw the first season and you liked this extra season you will like it.<br />

Este anime expande mas el universo de danmachi y esta bueno eso. Lo único que no me gusto de esta temporada es la elfo que es re fan de la espadachín. Por dios infumable por 8 capítulos después mas o menos te la aguantas pero es tan inútil que te da asco solo verla. La animación muy bien como la primera temporada después exceptuando la forra elfo, todos muy buenos los coprotagonistas. Una muy buena historia para mejorar la historia principal muy bien hecha. La banda sonora me recordó a K-On o sea no se si están relacionados por ahí la misma banda les hizo algunos temas pero me suena la cantante. Si viste la primera temporada y te gusto esta témpora extra te va a gustar.

    Ah, Danmachi.  With the harem/fantasy show’s legacy leaving behind such wonderful memes about its busty loli goddess heroine like the famous boob ribbon and ‘Hestia is Bestia’, it’s no wonder the show had a tough time having a complete positive footing in the anime community due to various aspects about it like its multitude of female characters wishing to breed like rabbits with its main protagonist.  So how can you make a show like that into something that’s similar, but objectively better in comparison?  Well, for starters you could follow the source material.<br />
<br />
Story: Sword Oratoria is the Danmachi story shown from a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251678">
        different perspective.  Instead of following the adventures of the Hestia Familia with Bell and his journey to become adventurer that he wanted to be, we follow the story of the Loki Familia and its sword princess, Ais Wallenstein, as she and those in her familia unravel the truth of strange going-ons in the dungeon and uncover a darker plot happening in the town or Oratoria.<br />
<br />
In contrast, the story of Sword Oratoria is a more serious take on the fantasy dungeon story of Danmachi, as it features an overarching mystery plot that those in the Loki Familia attempt to uncover as stronger and more bizarre monsters appear both in the town and in the dungeon.  As such, the plot feels a lot more serious and more involved, as the story shifts from a generally lighthearted adventure involving a boy climbing his way to the top, to that of a slightly darker story featuring a girl coming to terms with some of her demons from the past.  The overall plot just feels better written due to the fact that it feels like there’re consequences and that there truly are stakes to be had.<br />
<br />
If that were the case, then we’d have no problems.  Unfortunately, the story falls flat on delivering that darker and weightier atmosphere that the story at first glance seems to promise.  A lot of the heavier and more gruesome moments from the manga are absent, and instead we’re treated to the fangirling delusions of an elf mage desperately trying to monopolize the full attention of the sword princess.  While the story is objectively better from a tone standpoint, the actual content of the series is littered with random moments of our new character Lefiya attempting to be what appears to be a shoddier attempt at being another Bell.  This results in a lot of tonal shifts that draw away from the impact of the main plot, thus not only making things a lot less dire, but also making the new character we’re supposed to support, a lot less appealing to the audience.<br />
<br />
The ending is a culmination final standing point for progression to the next point of the series.  It’s an ‘ending point’ that only finishes the first part of the story that seems to be real final stakes moment, but doesn’t really feel that way when you look at everything before it.  Arguably it’s not a terrible ending, but when put alongside the journey to get to that point, things could be better.<br />
<br />
Overall, Sword Oratoria, while considered to be a better story due to the show’s more serious atmosphere involving character exploration and some disturbing aspects about the dungeon that weren’t mentioned before, still falls in its own pitfalls and makes unnecessary sacrifices that resulted in the show feeling less impactful and slightly more irritating to watch.  Simply put, if we cut out all of the fluff involving Lefiya’s obsession over Ais, this would’ve turned out a lot better.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Different and better viewpoint of the Danmachi story<br />
-  Sacrificed emotional weight for less important fluff aspects<br />
-  Changes from source material suffered<br />
<br />
Characters:  Instead of Hestia, Bell, and the rest of their familia, we’re treated instead to Loki and the expansive (and well equipped) myriad of misfits that she has managed to raise and grow.  <br />
<br />
Of course, if you’re talking about someone in the Loki familia, you have to talk about Ais Wallenstein, the mysterious female swordsman that Bell idolizes after she saved his ass.  Several times.  While shown to be a cool and collected girl in the original Danmachi, Ais’s character really shines through in Sword Oratoria as its main focal point.  We’re given a look into her past and her own internal struggle, pushing her away from the idealized sword princess that everyone treats her as, and instead as someone who feels more human and wants to improve based on her current state when we’re introduced to a different side of her character.  We also get to see her interactions and opinions about Bell in a different light, and it’s really refreshing to see who I thought initially was a boring character become something that had more to her with each passing episode.  <br />
<br />
Then…Lefiya…  I’ll be honest; I don’t like this girl.  Lefiya is what I would describe to be everything that’s mostly wrong with this adaptation.  The show initially treats us to her as a compatriot of Ais, as the two of them are in the same familia and are often put on the same team together.  Her entire character can be described as a low level mage who looks up to Ais and wants to be looked at and praised by the sword princess.  However, what sets her apart from a certain rabbit boy is the fact that the show goes so far with her wish that it becomes uncomfortable.  When she’s not busy getting her ass saved by everyone around her, Lefiya spends a good portion of her screentime fantasizing about spending time with Ais to almost disturbing levels. It takes away any potential screentime to be dedicated to the main plot, and it detracts any likeable characteristics that this girl may have had in the first place because obsessive jealousy is not a cute characteristic.  <br />
<br />
Aside from these two, the rest of the screentime is split amongst more commonly known members in the Loki Familia including Loki herself, some new additions to the cast, and a couple other known characters in the series that don’t get as much as a role since they’re not all that important to the story of Sword Oratoria.  In terms of development, the majority of it is dedicated to either exploring the inner workings of the Loki Familia itself and how its members interact with one another, and some of the stories of the new additions to the cast that we’re given.  I lot of it really is more akin to world building, but that really doesn’t serve as much of a problem since it only furthers expand the world and the kinds of people within the world of Danmachi, which is always a nice little extra to have.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Ais’s spotlight develops her well<br />
+ Side cast aids in providing more of the world to the audience<br />
-  Lefiya’s apparent obsessive personality.<br />
<br />
Art:  Made by J.C. Staff, the art for Sword Oratoria is the same quality as the original Danmachi.  The colors and animation is clear, colorful, and evokes a bright adventurous feel, the action is fluid enough for it to seem like a good enough fight scene/rpg battle for those in the viewing audience, and things are pretty consistent throughout.  It’s standard fare, nothing too amazing or anything worth getting excited over.<br />
<br />
Sound:  Similarly, the soundtrack isn’t something that’s worth really writing home about.  The OP is cheerful and adventurous sounding, but nothing that memorable or special.  Its ED ‘Day by Day’ on the other hand is a more laid back piece that completely contrasts the supposed more serious nature of the show.  It’s a decent piece, and worth a listen to, but not really something that I’d personally give too much thought on.  <br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:  A lot of things I’ve heard from the grapevine about Sword Oratoria is the fact that it was collectively renowned as a spin-off that is superior to the main story.  Poking through it, it certainly was of better quality at least story-wise, as had a much more involved story with aspects that the original was simply lacking.  This adaptation however wasn’t dressed to impress.  While maintaining a slightly more serious tone, Sword Oratoria always felt like it was missing something, and the struggles with the characters in their fights felt too easy when compared to the scale of the creatures they had to fight.  (This ain’t some tiny Minotaur anymore.)  Needless to say, while I really hoped the adaptation met the expectations of the original, it’s unfortunate that things didn’t really turn out that way in the end.<br />
<br />
Did I like this series?<br />
<br />
Despite that, I did enjoy the series…relatively.  Aside from the depth with Ais’s character, I really liked what they did with Bell and how they showed parts of his journey in the original story from Ais’s perspective.  It’s strange to say, but I actually liked and felt a lot more involved with Bell’s story when the camera wasn’t focused on him.  <br />
<br />
What didn’t I like about this series?<br />
<br />
Lefiya.  Lefiya wasn’t like this in the manga, so the upped ante with her admiration for Ais to an almost disturbing, creepy, and downright mean-spirited nature towards anyone foreign who’d want to so much as talk to the sword princess was definitely not an aspect that I was a fan of.<br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you’re an anime Danmachi fan who chooses not to touch or read any of the source material, than this is probably the show for you.  The contrasts between the source material and this adaptation would make anyone who came from the manga side definitely unhappy.  Despite that, the series still keeps many of the story’s aspects intact, and is still what I would think to be a much better version of the story simply because the core aspects of it are centered more on a centralized story and characters, rather than just one character like the original. <br />

Dungeon Ni Deai Sword Oratoria is a spin off anime that is adapted from the manga of the same name and tells the story of the original story that is shown through the eyes of the Sword princess Ains Wallenstein, her comrade and fellow familia member Lefiya and her fellow familia members. While largely following the events of the main anime series this anime also adds in events that Ains and her friends faced in that time frame. <br />
<br />
Story overview <br />
<br />
The overall storyline for Dungeon ni Deai Sword Oratoria largely follows the events of the anime that this anime was spin off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251658">
        from but tells the events of that story through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya and other members of their familia. While largely following the original storyline this anime also adds in several events and story arcs that are unique to Ains and Lefiya. In common with modern anime storytelling methods the overall plot of the series includes a number of sub plots and arcs that are intermingled with the main storyline. The Main focus for the series’ main storyline is on two points which is the evolution of Ain’s personality so that she becomes more human and less cold and for Lefiya it’s to master her fear while also developing her skills as a mage. <br />
<br />
Ains <br />
<br />
Ains Wallenstein voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Clockwork Planet and Denpa Kyoushi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two heroines in this series. An adventurer of some renown within the world Ains is known as the sword princess to her both her fans and to her fellow familia members for the simple fact that she is both beautiful in appearance and deadly with her blade. Notably Ains develops two different personalities as the series progresses which also serves as one of the main points of the series story. In the beginning of the series Ains was a quiet person that while skilled in combat and having a determination to both win battles and glory for her familia did not interact much with her familia and its members. Though clearly idolized by the younger members of the familia and respected by the more veteran members Ains at this point seems to be content with being quiet and as such she was hard to approach by anyone and not someone that many within the familia got to know well though not from a lack of trying. As a result of putting up walls around herself Ains can be somewhat naive with her manners and how she reacts to situations such as her struggle to apologize to Bell during her arc. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses however and as a result of interacting more with her friends and fellow familia members especially Lefiya and the twins Ain’s personality starts to change as she starts to open up her personality. Though she doesn’t exactly become more talkative Ains becomes more sensitive to the feelings of others and more understanding of the people around her. More importantly she also began to be more trusting and willing to place her trust in her allies and friends in the familia as well. I felt that Ain’s development from a beautiful but unapproachable warrior to one that was obviously more happy and positive and trusting was done pretty well and it was nice seeing Ains be able to interact more with her fellow familia members. After all, in such a group if you are unable to trust someone with your back in combat then that person is a liability no matter how powerful they are on their own. One of the main plots for the series overall storyline is related to Ains past which I felt was quite interesting and helped determine why Ains personality was like that to begin with. It also explained why Ains is so determined to become strong as well. The character of Ains and her subsequent development as a character in the series I felt was done pretty well and it was nice that Ains at the end was able to have more trust in her allies and friends and that she is now approachable by her fellow familia members. Saori Oonishi I felt did a pretty good job portraying the character of Ains. <br />
<br />
Lefiya<br />
<br />
 Lefiya voiced by veteran seiyuu Juri Kimura of Seiren fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two heroines for the series. A young elven mage of the Loki Familia and a second-class adventurer that due to her immense magical ability is being tapped to replace her master Riveria one day. Personality wise Lefiya is a positive, cheerful and innocent person that in the beginning of the series was a bit of a klutz and as a result got scared rather easily. However, despite that Lefiya perseveres in her attempts to be strong as her main motivation for being in the familia is to be near her idol Ains which she idolizes and views as something akin to a hero figure in her life. <br />
<br />
Although relatively weak and easy to get scared in the beginning of the series as the series goes on Lefiya like Ains starts to develop into a better person and character after finding the reason and determination that she needed in order to motivate her and start her drive to become strong. As a result of this development Leafiya becomes braver, more determined and more willing to take a stand to protect not just herself but also her friends and allies as well. Lefiya’s most prominent personality trait is arguably her earnest and determined nature and the fact that she is always willing to believe in the best of people. As a result of this Lefiya is one that doesn’t give up easily and once she set on doing something she’s determined to finish it no matter what. The friendship that Lefiya managed to forge with Filvis is a great example of this personality trait of hers. <br />
<br />
As a character Lefiya was very similar to the original anime’s main character Bell in that both were pretty weak to start with but both began to get stronger as they found the reason and motivation that they needed to become strong. While in Bell’s case it was to help repay the kindness that his patron god Hestia gave him for Lefiya it was her determination to be of use to both her hero Ains but also to the familia and her friends that support her. while Lefiya’s personality improved significantly over the series this wasn’t the only thing that improved as Lefiya’s ability and her true ability also manifested as a result of these changes. While she may have been weak in the beginning and vulnerable to fear and pressure the Leafiya that stood in the latter part of the series was anything but weak as by mastering her fear and learning new spells from her friends and allies have really made her a force to be reckoned with.  I felt that as a character Lefiya was developed pretty well and that her seiyuu Juri Kimura really did a great job voicing her. <br />
<br />
Riveria <br />
<br />
Riveria voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayako Kawasumi of Fate stay night fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Ains and Lefiya’s main allies in the familia. A veteran mage that heads the mage division within the familia and charged with training them Riveria is also a member of the familia’s upper command echelon being old friends with Finn and Gareth. A calm and composed woman that’s also wise and perceptive Riveria serves as the voice of reason and logic within the guild and helps tamper the tendency of her familia members from going wild. Being both a veteran mage and a member of the command echelon Riveria is both a powerful mage and adapt at reading the battlefield and as a result often acts as the second in command to the guild when Finn is otherwise engaged. As a result of her skills Riveria is powerful combatant and seems particularly adept at casting large scale AOE attacks that are both large in scale and powerful to a fault. As a result of being a founding member of the familia alongside that of Finn and Gareth Riveria is someone that is familiar with both Ains past and Lefiya’s struggles which actually enable her to support both when they need help. As the series progresses and as both Ains and Lefiya change and improve both their personalities and their skills Riveria is there to support them and guide them along the correct path. Though only a support character I felt that Rivera had an important role in ensuring that both Ains and Lefiya were able to find their motivations and reasons for getting stronger and guide them so that it helps them the most. I felt that her seiyuu Ayako Kawasumi really did a great job portraying the character of Riveria. <br />
<br />
Revis <br />
<br />
Revis voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Ohara of Fairy tail and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the support characters in the series and serves as one of the main villains in the series. A powerful adventurer that Ains and the familia meet during their investigation into strange events on one of the lower floors of the dungeons that lay beneath the town in which they reside Revis is someone that was deeply connected with Ains past and is an important part of that particular sub plot for the series. A formidable swordswoman that is extremely powerful and able to go toe to toe with Ains and still win Revis is a pretty mysterious person who seems to know a great deal about Ains family and seems to perceive Ains as her mother for some reason. While a formidable fighter Revis’s personality is hard to determine due to her mysterious nature but it can be seen that she is a quiet and determined person who is also highly motivated for her own goals. At the same time, it can be seen that she isn’t loyal to anyone but herself and will think nothing off turning against her own allies if the situation turns against them. While Sayaka Ohara did an excellent job in portraying Revis I feel that this character could have been expanded upon a lot more though her role in the series I felt was pretty clear cut in that she served mainly to motivate Ains to get stronger. <br />
<br />
<br />
Filvis <br />
<br />
Filvis Challia voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Lefiya’s main allies in the series. An elven magic swordswoman with a somewhat icy disposition at first Filvis is somewhat different from the other allies that Lefiya meets in the series as Filvis is from a different familia and they only met by chance when their familia’s cooperated for a mission. In the beginner of the series Filvis was a bit of an enigma to both her familia members and her god that she protects. In the beginning of the series Filvis was shown to be very dutiful to her patron and at the same time very loyal. However, at the same time it’s also shown that she is very quiet to the point of being antisocial. As the series progresses it become clear that this was tied to a terrible battle in the past where out of all her friends and comrades that were dispatched to hunt down a nasty cult she alone survived. As a result of this event Filvis’s which was positive and determined back then changed to one that was downcast, quiet and unwilling to make friends or allies and also resulting in her putting up walls around herself to protect herself from her perception that she brings ruin to everyone that tries to be nice to her. <br />
<br />
Filvis’s past and her redemption forms part of Lefiya’s plot line and was one story arc that I really liked as in addition to seeing how determined Lefiya is to help a person that she just met I also came to understand and sympathize with the reason that caused Filvis turn into such a downcast and unsociable person.  And in the end, I was that that Filvis was able to take out the monster that was the cause of her trauma and also at the same time be able to strike up a friendship with Lefiya and also help her train and become a better person as well. Filvis’s new personality which is much more positive and cheerful and more importantly talkative was nice to see. She also looks so cute when she’s embarrassed when she’s around Lefiya as well. I felt that Filvis was a pretty well-developed character that was similar to Ains and Leafiya in that she too had something that she to overcome in order to be strong but in her case, it was also to recover from her trauma as well. I felt that Hisako Kanemoto really did a great job portraying her. <br />
<br />
Arms and animation <br />
<br />
In regard to the art that was used for this series I felt that the character designs for the new characters were pretty well done. Although we already seen Ains and Bete in the original anime I felt that the character designs for new characters like Lefiya and Filvis was pretty well done. The environments that were shown in the series I felt were also pretty well done. One aspect of art that I particularly liked in this series was the design of the monsters that the cast faced with the major ones looking pretty cool and scary in equal measure. In regard to the animation I felt that overall animation was pretty good but it’s in combat scenes that the series shines at. I felt that the combat scenes were done pretty well in the series especially the last climatic battle. <br />
<br />
Voice acting <br />
<br />
Voice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done and I felt that each of the characters in the series was portrayed reasonably well by their respective seiyuu’s and voice actors. Particular praise however I felt should go to Saori Oonishi, Juri Kimura and Hisako Kanemoto who voiced the characters of Ains, Lefiya and Filvis respectfully as I felt that they did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. Sayaka Ohara and Ai Kayano who voiced the characters of Revis and Andromeda respectfully also I felt did a great job in voicing their characters though I felt that Revis should have had a larger role in the series. <br />
<br />
Music <br />
<br />
The music for the series I felt was pretty good with the scene music being appropriate for each of the scenes that required it. The opening theme for the series which was Re- Illusion was sung by veteran singer Yuka Iguchi and was actually quite catchy and conveyed the sense of happiness like meeting some old friends that you haven’t seen in some time. The ending theme for the series was day by day which was sung by Kano and had a positive and upbeat tune to it that seems to covey the thought that each day is an adventure and that you should always look forward to the next day and what that brings to you. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
In overall Dungeon Ni Deai was an interesting anime that’s a bit different to what I seen and reviewed before. This comes from the fact that Dungeon Ni Deali is a spin off from an existing anime and takes place in the setting that was established by it rather than featuring a new setting entirely. The strong points that makes Dungeon Ni Deali Sword Oratoria such an interesting anime I felt was its strong story that focused on finding three things which is finding the motivation to improve oneself, finding a place to belong and finding a reason to get stronger, strong characters that were well developed, strong combat scenes and excellent voice acting and animation.  <br />
<br />
The overall story for the show I felt was one of the highlights of the show that when combined with character development really helped in establishing the series two main characters Ains and Leafiya as characters that have evolved as the series progressed becoming not just stronger on a martial level but also in terms of personality and motivation as well. The overall theme for the main story I felt was one that focused developing the characters of Ains and Lefiya by putting not just them but also their fellow familia members into a fight against a shadowy enemy that seems to know Ains on a personal level yet is powerful and well connected enough to also pose a threat to the familia even when they have a core of veterans in their ranks. In line with modern animes the overall plot of the series featured a number of sub plots that I felt did a great job of not just showing the overall threat to the familia but also to Ains and Lefiya herself as well. Of the sub plots I felt that Ains personal quest of fighting against someone that is both more powerful that she is and yet also possesses information on the mysterious past of Ains herself was pretty interesting. Another arc that I felt was done pretty well in this series was Lefiya’s arc in which she was able to break Filvis out of her shell through her persistence and save her from the nightmare that’s been hanging over her like a shroud. Although the main focus of the story was focused on the main characters of Ains and Lefiya and their quest to become not just stronger but also more motivated to both fight and find a place where they can be of help it’s important to note that the members of the Loki familia are also featured in the main plot. These characters though we seen glimpses of them before in the original anime were featured much more heavily in this one and it was nice to see them also fleshed out as well. Watching them care about Ains and Leafiya really reminds you that a familia is very much like a large family as well. <br />
<br />
One of the main highlights of this show was the characters but more specifically their development as both a person and also as a member of the Loki Familia. The main characters in this series which in this case was Ains and Lefiya I felt were actually pretty well designed and over the series developed into not just powerful combatants but also characters who had managed to find both the motivation that they needed to become strong but also a place and a purpose to their life that was missing before. Back in her base form that was shown in the original anime that this was spin off from Ains while a fearsome fighter was a rather quiet person that while certainly trusted and idolized by members of her own familia seemed to be someone that did not return this trust. Ains was someone that seemed to be someone that lived only for battle and viewed things like friendships and interaction with humans as something secondary to her. This series though did much to dispel that impression of Ains by showing not just what caused Ains personality to be so icy but also started her on the path of recovery where not just her relations with her friends and familia is better but also where her personality also changes to be more human of someone her age. The character of Lefiya though is slightly different to Ains in that while she was certainly in the original anime her role in it was relatively minor. As a result, it can be said that Lefiya is a character that this show actually introduced as a new character. In a way Lefiya’s default personally serves as a direct contrast to Ains as unlike her Lefiya was a talkative, positive and friendly person that while shy still cared about Ains and her fellow familia members. The development of both characters I felt was done pretty well and it was nice that in the end Ains had become more talkative and more considerate of other people’s feelings while Leafiya become braver and more willing to stand her ground and protect her friends.  Im also glad that in the end both managed to find both the motivation that they needed to get stronger while at the same time a place where both can belong and be of use to someone. <br />
<br />
Spin off anime’s though relatively common usually do not feature the original characters of the anime that spawned it as part of the main plat though there are exceptions to this role.  In this case the featuring of two of the main characters from the original anime as support characters though it made sense from a storyteller’s point of view was somewhat risky as it risked taking the attention away from the main characters. Though in this case because this anime’s main plot essentially told the story of the original anime though through the eyes of Ains and Lefiya this worry was largely unwarranted. In fact the presence of characters like Bell and Hestia only served as another point of motivation for Ains to become stronger. <br />
<br />
Dungeon Ni Deal had always been famed for the fact that it had some pretty good combat scenes that pitted either lone adventurers or small groups against powerful groups of monsters which though something often seen in fantasy anime is also a sight to see. The combat scenes in this series I felt still managed to do a good job of showing that adventurers even lone ones can still fight on toe to toe with fearsome creatures and opponents. And that with courage and determination even faced with a powerful enemy that was powerful enough to be overwhelming even a small party would be able to triumph if they fight smart that was best shown in the climactic battle in the end of the series.  In particular I really liked the battles that Ains fought against Revis because just as the battle is about who has the most martial might it’s also about who has the motivation to win as well.  <br />
<br />
In the end while Dungeon Ni Deai did have an interesting storyline and combat scenes that tied well with Ain’s past and her bloodline I felt that its main strength and what really made it stand out to me was its strong character development. Both Ains and Lefiya though featured in the original anime that spawned this was then very basic characters that well designed and acted was very bare and had no unique personality or backstory that made them stand out. In this anime, however as a result of both becoming main characters of their own right this was remedied and their development as characters served as the main plot. In this I felt this was where the anime really shined and seeing the journey that both went on and see them get stronger and find the motivation and reason that they want to become strong was what I felt this anime did best. Though Ains may have been as clueless as a ghost in the beginning and Lefiya may have got scared way too easily by the end they were anything but and this was the best reward for me I think.  <br />
