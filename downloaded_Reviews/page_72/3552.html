    Do not watch this anime. Instead, go into your kitchen, put on some dubstep, and start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and imagine the most generic fighting anime possible. Well done. You have created an experience almost as horrible as The God of High School.<br />
<br />
Allegedly, this anime is about high school students fighting in a tournament to win a wish. After watching it, I do not think any part of the synopsis is correct. Everyone is supposedly in high school, but none of them show the slightest signs of brain activity. Only a few of the contestants are actually students. There

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357976">
        is a bodybuilder, a 30-year-old construction worker, and an army sergeant, to name a few. It seems like the author forgot his own premise. Calling this show a tournament would also be a lie. The main character, Jin Mori, is wrapped so tightly in plot armor he is invincible. A bomb could explode right beside him, and he’d be unscathed. Amazing logic! His entire personality is limited to being loud, annoying, and comically overpowered. Occasionally he is drawn with chibi artwork to highlight just how obnoxious he is. Someone had the genius idea to add comic relief chibi-art at random times while people are fighting and killing each other. But who cares about tonal consistency when you have sakuga?<br />
<br />
Jin breaks the tournament rules all the time, and nothing happens. Even though the angsty committee who run the show are supposed to be threatening, they rarely punish him. He doesn’t deserve his wins. Jin gets stronger incredibly fast with no training too. I can’t cheer for a protagonist who never struggled for his powers. Why would anyone root for a hero who is given everything? Jin had a one-minute training montage, now he can heal any wound by poking it with his finger. No joke, this really happens. Jin always holds back his powers because he has a secret plan. He reveals his cool new moves, but it’s not impressive. We’re never allowed to see his strategies, so there’s no build-up. It’s the same trite formula every fight. All we get is mindless back and forth of punches and kicks. It’s equivalent to removing a WWE commentator. In the manhwa, there were fighting style explanations. All of them were removed from the adaptation. There’s an announcer for the tournament who contributes nothing except enthusiastic introductions.<br />
<br />
In the first episode, Jin met his friends Mira and Dae-wi. The first fight scene is one of the best in the show. The bike chase that began the episode was very well choreographed. The voice acting was frantic, and so was the music. Everyone fought together. The characters interacted with the environment in ways they never do again. The campy comedy felt sincere—afterward, it was nowhere to be seen. Mira and Dae-wi are the most powerful competitors, but somehow they’re more underwhelming than Jin. Mira is determined to be a worthy successor to her late father by carrying on her family’s sword and combat style. Other than a few scenes to herself, Mira gets virtually no time at all. Her fights are shorter, and sometimes all we see is the beginning and end. Dae-wi had one motivation in the whole show. His entire reason for being in the tournament became irrelevant, but he still stayed in. His backstory was interesting, but he became obsolete after a couple of episodes. The three of them have no chemistry at all. They only seemed like friends in the outro credits (Where they do friend stuff together). The opening provides some “character development,” too, but that’s if you can listen to it. Listening to the OP is like getting stabbed in the eardrums with rusty knives. Imagine mixing dubstep and the sound of nails scraping a chalkboard.<br />
<br />
The only reason why I kept watching the God of High School was the fight scenes and sakuga. It really pissed me off when they gave people a backstory moments before they would lose. It’s pointless. With every passing episode, more characters were added. There were increasingly more plot-lines. The pacing became so fast it felt like a 50 episode anime was beaten with a shovel until it fit in 13 episodes. We were told that important fights happened without getting to see them. They’ll show us the beginning and end but skip everything else. They just show us the outcome. We’re told The God of High School tournament is broadcasted worldwide, but it’s never incorporated into the setting to build up the fights. Even the main characters lose track of the new powers their opponents are fighting with. This puts them at a disadvantage, but why should we care? They’re in a tournament, but they’re too stupid to watch their upcoming opponents on TV? How am I supposed to believe they are THIS dumb. I can’t enjoy God of High School if it makes no sense to me. What am I supposed to do? Stare at the sakuga with drool dripping down my face? Pass. Is this the future of anime? God, I hope not.<br />
<br />
The characters move from one fight to the next without existing in the setting. They don’t know what’s happening beyond their red clown noses. The author churns out new characters like a cardboard cut-out printing press. People blow themselves up, summon spirit sharks and giant bazookas. It’s like Looney Tunes, except bloody and boring. The rules of this world don’t make any sense. The fights never affect the setting. They fight in public, damage property, and kill people, but it rarely explains how this affects actual citizens. The author could’ve avoided this gaping plothole with a simple solution. If the tournament took place in an alternate dimension, it would explain why the setting is empty. Even Hand Shakers, the infamously terrible anime from 2017, got this right. Somehow God of High School is even stupider than that shitshow. Calling GoH a shit show would be insulting to both shit and shows. At least after a shit, you feel better. After this, I just felt dead inside.<br />
<br />
The fight choreography makes the fight scenes even less comprehensible. Jin grazes his opponent in one fight, but the sound effects are so impactful you could mistake it for a fistfight. The same punching sounds are repeated in rapid succession. It’s like One Punch Man 2 all over again. Did the sound editors even communicate with the director? God of High School’s animation gets a lot of praise, which is deserved for specific action sequences, but for two-thirds of the show, it looks very average. The visuals are spectacular… in a couple of scenes. Due to the clusterfuck of a script, the editing lacks continuity. We skip from one place to the next in less than thirty seconds. It’s difficult to follow any of the storylines. There are so many details lost between stories. Attempting to catch up with everything that has happened makes it impossible to just enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Fights take place in the streets, and buildings are destroyed… but no one seems to care. Are there police officers? Military? Firefighters? DOES ANYONE EXIST IN THIS WORLD?! It doesn’t seem like it! I guess the author just didn’t finish that part! I have no idea why the author added magic to this show. They cut out every explanation of the magic when adapting the script. Magical circles are copied and pasted everywhere like you’d see in a generic isekai anime. Massive swords fall from the sky, and people literally have Jojo’s stands. <br />
<br />
In other, better fantasy stories, the world would look much different from magic. It would advance technology, architecture, science, and change the media. God of High School didn’t bother. It is a lazy cash grab. Rather than being original, it regurgitates tired genre tropes and cliches. There is no artistic integrity in this script. The pacing flies at breakneck speed, making it hard to follow along. All I could do was try to make sense of what I was watching. If you want to understand what’s happening, you need to read the Wiki.<br />
<br />
God of High School was filled with unnecessary advertising for Crunchyroll and Webtoon. Their intentions were obvious--to advertise the webtoons and convince people to buy them. It’s unclear if they will make sequels to these anime. I thought it was just an Easter Egg the first time. Anime studios often subtly integrate their name into their shows. Unlike artists, Crunchyroll does not care how obnoxious their logo is. Their advertisement is plastered on every side of the God of High School battle arena. Sponsored by Crunchyroll! Sponsored by Webtoon! They make sure you never forget who paid for what you’re watching. How ironic that they attached their name to the shittiest anime they’ve funded. How embarrassing. Even though this anime isn’t high art, it is slimy to put your company’s name all over the show. Does the anime take place in a world where Crunchyroll exists? No, they are just comprised of greedy investors who don’t give two shits about anime. Crunchyroll messed up this adaptation. They chose to adapt 118 chapters, that’s 9 chapters every episode. What we have here is a shitty 13 episode trailer for the webtoon. This is an embarrassment for MAPPA, a studio filled with passionate artists.<br />
<br />
The God of High School is a burning dump truck stinking up the entire anime industry. This catastrophe can never happen again, but I know it will as long as they keep making money. This is a genuinely baffling piece of animation. They tried their hardest to entertain us but failed miserably. The saying, “Too many cooks spoil the broth,” explains this anime excellently.<br />
<br />
It’s boring as hell, the story is a clusterfuck, the characters are walking cliches, the powers are unexplained, and it’s all riddled with plot holes wider than the Mariana Trench. MAPPA has a few extraordinary skills, including motion capture fight choreography. Once in a while, the visuals are godly. The advertisements take these fights out of context to claim it is amazing. For the rest of the show, the art is hideously mediocre. I’ve never seen an anime with a budget as high as The God of High School’s that can be compared to the worst action anime ever made.

    To summarize the whole show: Generic Side Characters, Generic Protagonist, and Generic Mindless Fighting.<br />
<br />
Slight spoilers for the first four episodes ahead -<br />
<br />
This is solely based on the current 4 episodes of the anime and not the original Webtoon (I have not read it).<br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
There is no plot to be found. To start, a tournament is held to crown the strongest high school student in Korea. The people that join have extremely typical anime character abilities. The prize is that one wish will be granted to the winner. We soon learn that the competition is held by an ominous organization with seemingly malevolent intentions (Wow! So

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350104">
        creative!). Nothing happens after this. People just fight, and the characters are not expanded on. If you like pointless fights with no plot, this show is for you. Some of the fans may say that the story gets better, but there&#039;s no explanation for not progressing the plot barely in 4 episodes. <br />
<br />
Characters: 1<br />
Truly terrible characters. Our protagonist Jin Mori is not interesting at all. He has no traits that set himself apart from Son Goku from the popular Dragon Ball series. Jin seems to be the strongest high school student, loves food, is notably oblivious in many situations, and tries to protect his friends. The author just stole all of Goku&#039;s personality and changed how the character looked. Just as with Jin, side characters are not unique. They are basic characters that have no personality aside from a single defining trait. Character development is completely void from the show. In addition, their motivations for entering the tournament are nothing special. Everyone has seen these typical reasons before. <br />
<br />
Sound 8:<br />
Sound effects and music are well done. Nothing much to say<br />
<br />
Animation: 10<br />
Some of the best animation I have seen. Mappa did extremely well with this and made the fight scenes fluid and amazing to watch.<br />
<br />
Character Design: 5<br />
Basic and average. Not unique or special.<br />
<br />
Final Rating: 2  <br />
Overall, the appalling writing and characters can not be redeemed by the near flawless animation. This show seems to have been made with the focus on the story in the backseat. After watching the whole series, I intend to make an update to this review. I hope that The God of High School will be able to change my opinion.<br />
<br />
Edit: It was too painful to finish this show, so I can&#039;t make an update. <br />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Two words: MASTER-PIECE<br />
When you thought that your favourite anime had come to your top to stay for a long time, when you conceived that your life would not be enlightened again by an artwork of such caliber, God of Highschool soon came knocking on everyone’s door, what am I saying knocking!, breaking down the door and establishing themselves as the best anime ever.<br />
<br />
Where should I start? Its pacing and story-telling? Marvelous. Who else doesn’t love when things are so rushed that after 13 episodes you don’t have any idea of what is the main goal of the series...or even the main goal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357970">
        of its characters? Is it world destruction? God supremacy? Supporting the case of why taekwondo should continue being at the Olympics? No determination whatsoever!<br />
As a matter of fact, us members of society can recall that WE ALL LOVE pointless fights without any meaning nor backstory; why wouldn’t we, if I may ask? Devices such as plot twists, showcasing character motivations, displaying impactful moments or executing contrasts properly in order to build up/shift momentum, change characters status quo, conveying emotions through the screen, or just for the sake of having an interesting, meaningful action scene are things that GoH NEVER contemplated, which, in my humble opinion, sets the tone on how things must be done on any anime which places value in providing quality content to its viewers. Greatness.<br />
<br />
Speaking about greatness, we must ask ourselves about the integrity of the “plot”. It had been awhile since the last time I’ve watched a show which had such an organised, perspicuous and easy to follow plot, with no plot holes or unexplained sudden events whatsoever. For example: Seoul&#039;s population looks doomed because the good guys seem incapable of dealing with &lt;&lt;Nox&gt;&gt;?  No worries, Alchemist-san saves the day transporting the whole city to a cliff out of nowhere. Already not convinced? What about if I told you that the show has a mysterious aura around it (however I have not been able to grasp it yet)? <br />
And don&#039;t get me started with this show&#039;s coherence -one of its strengths-, like for instance, when the show it&#039;s stuck in a cul-de-sac, as they display their marvelous scripting techniques to solve the sticking point masterfully (e.g. kyuubi-power recovery from Ilpyo despite the key being detached from him) <br />
<br />
And what about the GoH universe itself and its mechanics? Nothing notorious, just a normal society with its ups and downs, a little bit corrupted and all...oh, did I forgot to tell you that it&#039;s based on Ancient Rome? Such an elegiac tone! I mean, it’s pretty obvious when you notice how people love to rock the dome to see how high school students martial-fight to death...where the lions at? Oh, before I forget! Did you think this was a martial arts-esque show? Nothing further from the truth! By episode 8 you realise that EVERYONE has something known as “Charyeok” -kind of a borrowed power from an ancient God who had appeared twice in previous episodes- and that they are going to fight with it pretty much for the entire time. Greatness.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I personally have to say that the major asset of this series is its originality. A mysterious organization stages a tournament in order to find the strongest high school student in Korea, but apparently it&#039;s all staged, being their “main goal” to find a “key” (which, apparently, is well-known that has to be inside a highschool student) that will help them fight a more mysterious and darker organization (as you must infer, because it’s never said due to the complexity of the plot and how they play mind games with us) who wants to destroy the world as we know. It is not my role to discern for you, but allow me to say that I had never heard of anything like this. NEVER EVER.<br />
<br />
And let’s not forget about the originality of our characters! Whether it&#039;s our MC Mo-Ri, an oblivious, food-lover, meathead, “don’t you dare touch my friends” who just wants to live life fighting strong people, for the sake of becoming stronger; Mi-Ra and her pursue of power to prevent the ostracism of her family’s hallmark or even our s1 antagonist, a guy who wanted to feel relevant by any costs and rejected his personality and liveliness for the likes of a third party. Amazingly unique, isn’t it?<br />
Speaking about this, highlight the ability of the writers in God of Highschool to avoid breathing life into their fictional characters. Motivations, backstories, RELATABILITY...the writers could had made the mistake of believing that these would have helped them develop a marvelous, compelling story which made the audience empathise with the cast on a personal level, laughing/suffering/crying with them as different events took place during the show, but, fortunately, they were quick-thinkers enough to avoid using these devices. <br />
<br />
Backtracking a little bit, talking about the artistic component of the show, it’s obvious that MAPPA made sure that the quality of the animation in God of High School was good enough to support their OFF THE CHARTS job in the plot and characters counterpart. Fluidity and choreography looked, for the most part, good enough -especially during fight scenes-, sakuga animation was carried out surprisingly well, backgrounds were depicted nicely, characters were designed properly...art and animation was quite good, with the only complaint on how camera rotations and 3D movements were often overused, making it, on those specific moments, something really hazy to watch.<br />
<br />
By the same token, music has had a leading role in the “success” of this season. Good job enhancing the different emotions that were on display during different moments, whether it was hyping up the moment when a fight was taking place, intensifying the sense of urgency, ...yet I really missed a banger as OP. Voice actors did a notable job, felt like it had to be said.<br />
<br />
So, at the end of the day, I guess that if you&#039;ve reached the end of this review you&#039;ll have the same opinion as myself: GoH is a great piece of rubbish.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#039;s a resistance for people to talk about things that make them feel guilty. When natural disasters happen, it&#039;s easier not to feel guilty about it.&quot;

    No, my eyes aren’t deceiving me. I finished today, what I see as one of the most overhyped, yet underwhelming show of the year. The God of High School represents the type of show that is forced down our throats like the next big thing. Advertised as a Crunchyroll original, this anime has convinced me that there’s little hope for a decent manhwa adaptation in the future. Don’t let your eyes deceive you by the flashy animation and aesthetics. The God of High School is a show I wouldn&#039;t dream of recommending.<br />
<br />
As I sat here wondering what went wrong, my initial impression of the anime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357969">
        was actually hopeful. The first episode bought out the talents of director Seong-Hu Park as he’s able to craft together some lavishly animated scenes. In fact, it’s easy to say the first episode is an eye catcher of animation with the amount of ass kicking and fast moving action. We are introduced to 17 year old Mo-Ri Jin, a martial arts from the country of South Korea. The free spirited young man has the ambition of a fighter, and seeking out powerful opponents to test his abilities. This is where we are introduced to the God of High School Martials Arts Tournament, a place for fighters all over the world to showcase their skills. <br />
<br />
Despite being the main protagonist, the story also introduces Mi-Ra Yu and Dae-Wi Han. Both characters also possesses talent in martial arts with their unique fighting styles. It’s why both are also invited to the GoHS tournament although they have different motives. For instance, Han participates in the fight to help his friend while Mira seeks to find a suitable marriage partner. No matter what the reason, it seems GoHS loves pushing the characters’ personalities at every chance it gets. The most prominent examples are when Jin gets excited at fighting a powerful opponent or when he is motivated. Other times, it’s when Jin finds a reason to fight, such as crashing a wedding and helping Mira. It’s motivations like this that sets off an early impression of the show. But with every progressing episode, the show degenerates into a chaotic mess.<br />
<br />
It seems the more and more I watched the show, the less I feel motivated myself to understand the main purpose of the story. What is it even trying to get us to understand? The main characters? The tournament arc? Or perhaps some sort of reason for God of High School to even exist? The meat of the show remains with the tournament and different fights that occurs throughout the main story. It also seems these fights often feels rushed and lacking importance. Even Han, a selfless man, who fights for the sake of others becomes a chore to watch. How many times do we have to hear his unenthusiastic dialogues? Every one of his fight feels similar and furthermore, it’s easy to say he is the most boring character to watch in the entire series. As the story ventures forward, we are thrown into more chaotic storytelling involving supernatural forces such as the Nine Tailed Guardian, God incarnates, and plot to kill certain divine beings. When you try to make a show spin out of control in such way, it sets off a ticking time bomb of chaos. <br />
<br />
Outside of the main cast, don’t expect much character development from the other characters. This is advertised as a 13-episode one cour series. To make the story flow, we are introduced to some significant side cast such as IIpyo Park. Serving as a more logical member of the cast, IIpyo is observant and not often the one to rush into battle head on. He appears to be one of the more mysterious member of the cast but unfortunately, the anime doesn’t get the chance to explore the full side of his character. This seems to fall in line with the majority of named characters, including one of the main antagonists, Mujin Park. As being the head in charge of the tournament, you can expect him to be the master pulling the strings. Being manipulative and calculating, Mujin represents the anti-thesis of Jin and the main cast. And to add on to the rogue gallery, there’s Taek Jegal, a major threat who treats almost everyone as worthless. His power hungry personality fees on his ego to the point where he cares for no one but himself. It’s the type of stereotypical antagonist you can come up in less than 5 seconds in any type of anime. Taek’s main rival appears to be Iipyo, but from a storyline perspective, he represents nothing more than a generic villain. With all said and done, background storytelling even falls short with info dumps about the cults, Gods, and other divine powers. Because let’s face it, this anime serves as little more than being an advertisement for a glorified fight show.<br />
<br />
Well, if there’s one selling point of the anime, it’s the animation. In fact, I can say The God of High School is more about showing than telling. From the first major fight and every other forward, it looks like the anime pushes the boundaries of animation. It’s stylistic and dynamic with fast paced motion. The comic-like art quality also makes the important fights feel like major attractions. When the anime settles for a lighthearted tone, it bounces back into comedic scenery of cartoonish character expressions. Even the music accompanied with the action sequences makes the fights more dynamic. If you wanted to see a visual action flick, The God of High School will be a hell of a ride.<br />
<br />
Don’t let those flashy animation fool you. This show wanted to be something special and indeed, it some ways managed to do that. But beyond the typical main trio cast and the ass kicking scenes, this is no more than a mediocre story trying its best to sell its product to you. Even with the sufficient funding, The God of High School reminds me to always, and always keep expectations in check for manhwa adaptations.

    Do I recommend this anime? No, unless you really want to watch it. <br />
<br />
Over the past few years, there have been quite a few shonen/action anime. Some of these shonen/action show flopped and became dreadfully bad, no plot, no reason to fight, and mostly just poorly done. The God of High School is yet another plotless action anime. When it comes to action animes like these there are always fans who will always call it a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
Story - 2/10<br />
Absolutely zero plot. Just fighting. They try adding mysteries and some plot but it&#039;s not done properly. Which makes the show even worse. They threw in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350110">
        a plot to make it better... <br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
I can&#039;t get over the fact that they have red noses and red ears. It makes them look drunk slightly and its also giving me OCD. Either way, the art was good, the animation had a little too much motion blur, but overall it was really well done. In my opinion, they also changed the art style for a few seconds for humor too many times. <br />
<br />
Sound - 4/10<br />
I&#039;m going to be 100% honest. I hate the intro and the animation that goes with the intro. The sound effects are a little overdone but honestly, I don&#039;t care about that part as long as it isn&#039;t cringe. <br />
<br />
Character - 2/10<br />
They overreact on everything. They contribute nothing to the plot. They have no background. They are too shallow. I could keep going on and on, but I&#039;m going to try finding good parts... At least they aren&#039;t annoying?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 4/10<br />
I enjoyed the mindless fighting. Besides that I hated it. <br />
<br />
Overall - 3/10<br />
I wouldn&#039;t be watching this if this season&#039;s pick were so bad. It was poor. It was just generic.

Two simple yet effective words that perfectly describe The God of High School, the ultimate travesty from Summer 2020 and yet another defective product via the courtesy of Crunchyroll. With their recently established “strategic” partnership, Crunchyroll and Webtoon took full advantage of the pandemic of the year 2020 to collaborate and present their lineup of products of “original animated content” known as “Crunchyroll Originals”. <br />
<br />
With the second coming of a webtoon adaptation, The God of High School, they’ve managed to fool tens of thousands of people all over the world into thinking this is one of the best action fantasy series to start

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357982">
        off the new decade of anime. Just like its webtoon sibling Tower of God (otherwise known as Kami no Tou), it became popular enough to be adapted for the sole sake of being Crunchyroll’s summertime gravy train, and with the help of studio MAPPA, it pressed for “style over substance” to wow and mesmerize the audience into thinking quantity is more important than quality.<br />
<br />
In terms of plot and worldbuilding, God of High School is an absolute mumble-jumble of loosely tossed-in parts. The story starts off looking like a “dumb fun” setup of a mixed martial arts “high school” tournament, where the winner will be granted a single wish as the ultimate prize. Tournament arcs in anime are the ultimate easy-to-make selling points, so on top of that, Crunchyroll and Webtoon also shamelessly slap their self-promoting logos all over the tournament itself, even though it doesn’t even really make much sense to do so, so it just looks silly onscreen in a bad way. <br />
<br />
The MMA setup then quickly morphs into a superpower free-for-all, cause superpowers also sell well. The power system in this series, known as charyeok, literally meaning “borrowed power”, is inserted into the plot with barely a damn shred of helpful exposition or background context; lacking any sort of tangible foundation, it’s literally a shitshow of randomly inserted abilities and powerups whipped out left and right for the sake of getting oohs and aahs from the viewers.<br />
<br />
The choice of pacing in the series is infuriatingly rapid and unruly. The staff apparently chose to mash or omit whole truckloads of chapters within single episodes for the sole sake of “getting to the good parts”. All it does is add to the chaos, as the scenes shift back and forth between the tournament and the underlying conflict in an unruly fashion; sure this may appeal to many people, but there’s no sense of organization or sophistication for enough, if any, of the showcased content to make sense. <br />
<br />
New characters keep showing up at random or in the masses, void of any sense of depth, purpose, creativity, or novelty. They are just simply there to make the main characters look good when defeating or assisting them, and are written off or ignored when no longer needed. The show tries to give empathic appeal to them via brief instances of “flashback jutsu” in half-hearted attempts to manipulate the audience into relating or feeling for them. Any motivation or backstory is simply glazed over, if not just completely cut out altogether.<br />
<br />
The story tries to have mystery elements to add suspense, but it’s hollow and predictable. It just serves to make whatever plot there is look more compelling and engaging in nature. To sum it up, everyone wants to challenge “God”. The whole tourney itself is controlled by an undercover organization whom wants to use it to gain a “Key” to reach “God”. They’re opposed by a cult group who wants to use that same “Key” to world domination. Yet we’re not given any helpful background context to explain the whole history. Then there’s also the typical jackass one-dimensional villain with a bland excuse of a background and motivation to be “super-bad”. I personally HATE these sort of villains in particular. They’re simply there to get on your nerves, flaunt around their ego without any sense of metaphorical or philosophical significance, and ultimately make the main protagonists look good when they fight and finally beat them. They have no actual depth character-wise and their purpose is superficial just like any other side character, cause once the plot is done with them, they’re disposed of like litter.<br />
<br />
There is no sense of coherence or order in the story. It’s a bunch of raw ideas and references dumped into one big pot without any consideration to follow a specific recipe step by step. Instead of an organized well thought-out story with great quirks, the narrative direction is akin to a pool of chaos. An incomprehensible collection of abstractions, it’s like an unholy crossover of a hundred different TV shows mashed together in discord. Grotesque and terrifying, it’s like an abomination of an entity taken right out of the universe of Cthulhu Mythos. Nothing but nonstop, mindless, soulless conflict and fights with no charm or quirk to speak of their own.<br />
<br />
Going back to the characters in general, they’re nothing of originality. They’re typical, generic, bland, and rehashed as part of a continually looped presentation of mediocre shounen tropes. The main cast is extremely dreary in particular. Jin Mori is your typical happy-go-lucky main protagonist who would always get the biggest upgrades and plot conveniences and keeps saying he wants to fight strong people, with nothing really going for him on an empathic level besides his ties to his grandpa...not like I haven’t seen something like that before. Han Daewi is your typical loner in the secondary main character role. His initial motivation to fight for his ill and dying friend, while initially promising, was not well thought-out or executed, and instead the show does a quickie fix for him with the regurgitated and cheap “friendship” clause. Yu Mira has that ubquitious character role where the inner conflict comes from family-related issues, which can be often get too conceited and grating in general. Her character work is simply glossed over within one episode and wasn’t given enough exposition and empathy to really be worth caring about on an emotional level. Jegal Taek is the bland-ass main villain mentioned earlier; he is ultimately inserted just to quickly set up your typical final battle to make Jin and co. look good, and he has absolutely no redeeming factors backing up his ego-filled composition. As for the rest of the other characters, they are merely plot devices to pull and yank the disoderly narrative along in its hasty tempo and also make the main characters look good, only adding to the chaos.<br />
<br />
God of High School is supposedly praised by many for its amazing looking animation quality, which is obviously the primary selling point. However, it’s not all that’s cracked up to be. One half of the time, the animation looks smooth and impressive with great camerawork and utilized calligraphy/ink style drawings. The other half of the time counterbalances most of the positives when the camera panning and rotating becomes redundant and overused. During many of the fights, characters are tweened lazily and sloppily, with seemingly a good amount of frames missing in a bunch of parts, resulting in awful-looking choreography and motion inconsistency. The animation also seems to lack enough impact frames to really sell the authenticity of the battles, which make nearly every “body blow” look comical instead of painful. In short, the animation quality is only slightly above average compared to your usual shounen series. The character designs have to be one of the silliest looking things I’ve ever seen in anime. Everyone who can fight has red noses and red earlobes, and some of them have their noses elongated. Why such an impractical design? Why do they need to look like Rudolph? Or even Pinocchio? Are they all sick with the flu or something? Why couldn’t they stick with a normal looking design like in the games based off this series? I can understand the fidelity to the character design in the source material, but it goes to show that the creator apparently didn’t think things through with their ideas on even basic standpoints.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks themselves are your typical battle shounen music, some good, some passable. The OP theme “Contradiction” is literally ear-rape, and my only good suggestion for listening to something like this is for maybe a workout session or as a form of Chinese-style torture. The ED theme “WIN” is notably better and gives a really nice and chill summer vibe to settle down the viewers from the chaotic scenes of each episode, but it’s better as a standalone soundtrack. The sound effects attempt to be fancy especially during certain “special moves”, but they’re nothing that special, and in fact, they feel out of place at times quite often, especially during parts when physical impacts are shown. As for the overall voice acting, it felt very stiff, unmotivated, and tone-dead; it’s like the voice actors are reluctantly giving out their lines in an apathetic manner, knowing how badly adapted this show is.<br />
<br />
I wouldn’t say I didn’t totally enjoy it at first. I initially wanted to embrace the series as “dumb fun” MMA series where the term “God” was just a metaphor and it’d be all about breaking down different types of martial arts with a little bit of hax here and there. It was not the case, unfortunately. When the series drastically turned onto its head, my enjoyment level grew less and less, even when I try to turn my brain off. It gradually went from rolling along leniently with the schlock setups to hurting my head trying to follow and comprehend what the actual hell is going on. It quickly became a huge mental endeavor just to really get myself to up to date with each week’s episode. I like action, but not mindless, soulless, emotionless, purposeless conflict like what God of High School committed. And oh yea, this is very subjective, but one more thing: I HATED the comedy. &quot;Chibi-fied&quot; comedic skits don&#039;t equal good tonal shifts; it&#039;s so obnoxious, sudden and forced that it&#039;s literally a walking bag of cringe.<br />
<br />
In the end, God of High School was one of the worst shows to come out of 2020. It had nothing to show for itself nor anything in general worth its weight in gold. Rather than sticking to simplicity and charm with compelling and inspiring presentations, it lacks any sort of substance, flavor, or genuine beauty and winds up as a head-scratching failed product brand. With practically no redeemable factors from this show other than a few great looking animated parts, this show is one I absolutely cannot recommend to even the hardcore action fans or novices. I will suggest to you to look elsewhere for a much more sophisticated anime, and steer VERY clear from the likes of those damned “Crunchyroll Originals”.

    Yet another Sho “carried by animation” nen. And this time it’s not even trying to hide the fact that it is all action and no plot. Unlike the other shonen flops that have come out recently this one doesn’t even try to make up a plot. It’s pretty sad to see the state of the shonen genre slowly but surely decline year after year. I look back at the glory days of shonen when FMAB  and AoT rattled us with mind blowing twist and turns and a beautiful story. And now we have the turd that is Dr. Stone, Fire Force, Demon Slayer, Black

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350095">
        Clover, Tower of God and now it’s newest pile, God of Highschool. <br />
<br />
Story: 1<br />
<br />
Story? What story? There is no story and that’s what this anime prides itself on, no story and all fighting, just the way everyone likes it… Not. Behold a grand tournament in a universe where Korean high school students look like 20-30 year olds and everyone is just suddenly okay with watching a bunch of “teens” fight to the death. I didn’t know we went back to ancient Rome with the gladiator pit. Jin Mori, a typical generic shonen maincha- I mean typical student who just happens to be very good at fighting. With his power up flashbacks and insane moves he will climb the ranks and move up in the tournament to be the God of High School. And.. That’s it. That’s literally all you need to know. I’m pretty sure the only plot in this show is the animation, which makes no sense but for some reason fits God of High School perfectly.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
<br />
It would be criminal to say the animation of this is not superb. The quality of MAPPA is indeed very appealing and I expect to see this fluent animation throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
<br />
The sounds are fine however the dubstep take they play throughout the series is pretty bad. The opening and ending is hard to sit through and unless you are a hardcore techno fan, then you wouldn’t like it.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3<br />
<br />
Typical boring cliche troupes of characters that you have seen so many times before. You have the tsundere who I’ll bet you the mortgage on my house falls in love with Jin eventually. You have the typical quiet badass that literally does nothing. You have the typical loud meathead shonen MC who is always hungry and wants to fight. I’m not even gonna say how many times that has been re-done. And… That’s it. Those are the only characters you really need to pay attention to. The rest of the characters are just gonna be there for plot convenience so it’s not worth going over them. Can these types of shows really not think beyond these basic troupes that have been recycled and re-used dozens of times. It’s not interesting or cool anymore, it’s eye rolling and boring. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
<br />
Despite me lashing out on this series, besides having to prematurely turn off your brain before hand, it is quite entertaining. The fight scenes are awesome and the animation to par. If you only care about thrill factor and just want a good watch, go for it. However, if you actually want a compelling and fleshed out series, I’d look somewhere else. Like I said, this anime seems to pride itself on being just action so if that’s what you want, hey go for it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2<br />
<br />
I guess all action and no plot anime’s just aren’t my thing. Which just so happens to be majority of new gen shonens, and shonen also being the most popular genre, it’s hard to have a bad opinion on it without being hunted down by shonen stans. Cause if you don’t like shonen then according to elitist you aren’t a true anime fan. Numerous genres are WAY more fleshed out and better than shonen but I guess I’m the 1% who thinks that. I will admit shonens of the past have been success stories however seeing the lineup of new gen shonens, I just want to gag. I’ve said what I wanted and I hope this anime can create some type of foundation cause that’s what it’s gonna need if it wants me to stick around.

<br />
With another shounen WEBTOON adaptation comes yet another disaster. Colour me surprised. While the source material isn&#039;t the greatest narrative to work from and leaves much to be desired, to go even further and butcher already subpar material to the point of being irredeemable is quite an achievement. <br />
<br />
One of the most admirable and compelling qualities of a skilled writer is the ability to breathe life into a fictional character. Backstories, motivations, exposition, relatability; there are various tools that are paramount for establishing a connection between a viewer and a character, and that connection is the very factor that spurs a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350107">
        compelling story. The ability to compel an audience to relate with a cast on a personal level, to revel its triumphs and suffer from its downfalls, to laugh or cry with nothing more than a mere figment of their imagination is what separates mediocre writing from great writing. But unfortunately, to even call God of Highschool &#039;mediocre&#039; would be dishonest. <br />
<br />
The God of Highschool cast is, in a word, completely uninspired. Because like most shounen, the anime is far more interested in constructing one dimensional characters that are effectively the same chaotic conglomeration of incessantly rehashed shounen tropes we&#039;re forced to witness every single cour than meaningful, relatable characters. Jin Mori, or rather budget Son Goku, fills the role of your typical happy-go-lucky shounen protagonist, Han Daewi has quite literally no discernible personality, and Mira Yu is, unsurprisingly, the token hotheaded female sidekick that effectively serves nothing more than the role of a third wheel. As far as characters go, God of Highschool spares not even a shred of creativity or originality. It has nothing to call its own and provides nothing notably meaningful or interesting in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Not only are the bases of the cast uninspired enough, but to add insult to injury, any sort of exposition regarding character motivations and backstory are either glossed over or completely omitted, throwing us right into a chaotic disgrace of a tournament arc right from episode one. After all, God forbid MAPPA actually makes an attempt to provide a meaningful and cohesive story, rather than adapting a whopping eleven chapters an episode, glossing over important concepts and providing a half-assed adaptation all for the sake of cramming an extra content that is not even remotely worth watching into a one cour adaptation. There is no attempt to establish and explain Han Daewi&#039;s relationship with his ill companion. No attempt to shed light on Yu Mira&#039;s actual disposition, her motivations and her struggles regarding her family situation. And ultimately, no attempt to actually provide a suitable foundation that would allow the events of arc 1 to have any meaningful emotional impact. Is this really worth losing for the sake of extra content?<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, God of Highschool seems to be revered for its quality of animation, enough that it&#039;s effectively considered the selling point of the show. While there are particularly significant highlights showcasing great camerawork and choreography, there are far more than enough poorly handled fights to counterbalance the positives. The rotating camera effect is overused and an absolute eyesore. Characters are often just lazily, slowly tweened from place to place, making various fights feel irritatingly slow paced and carelessly executed. A lack of impact frames means many attacks feel like they have absolutely no weight behind them. And the &quot;single-stroke battle&quot; trope being used not once, but three times in the Baek Sungcheul fight was laughably bad. GoH animation is nothing admirable, and its occasional highlights and the fact that it&#039;s able to display slightly more effort than your run of the mill shounen are all it has going for it.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, God of Highschool provides neither anything of its own nor anything of worth. Rather than the simple but compelling and flashy demeanor it intends to give off, it showcases neither substance nor flavour and is an utter waste of time. If you&#039;re looking for great animation and choreography, watch Katanagatari. If you&#039;re looking for a compelling and deep story, watch SnL. If you&#039;re looking for a great cast, watch Run With the Wind. Because God of Highschool proved itself a complete and utter failure when it came to showcasing any such factors at a particularly commendable level of quality.

    The biggest disappointment of the season finally comes to a close.<br />
<br />
I didn’t always see The God of High School as a bad show. In fact, there was actually a time when I saw a lot of potential in this series and would even look forward to watching new episodes. In the end, everything was just executed so poorly that I can’t even appreciate the good parts I had originally enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Story: 2<br />
The story is very typical shounen. A teenage boy with missing parental figures enters a competition. People can tell he’s kinda special, and some weird things go on behind the scenes. For the first half

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357972">
        of the series, I was actually really excited about where the story was going (even if there were a lot of holes). I felt like it was okay for some details to be left unknown. I thought maybe they were just adding some mystery to the plot while they strengthened the world building, but apparently they left out so many important details that I was still left in the dark by the end of the story, and the world building was not strengthened at all. The lack in clarity, the missing details, and the failure to tell the story properly eventually ruined any potential this show may have had. If anything, it’s a waste of a decent concept, so I’ll probably try to pick up the Webtoon.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The animation was good. I thought the fights were really well done. I wasn’t a big fan of the big gods coming out of the sky though.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
The OP fit the anime really well in my opinion. It’s not the greatest song in the world (and hard edm is kind of a love it or hate it genre) but I felt like it went well with the theme of the anime and the animation. The ED was good too. Really modern OST. Sound effects during the fight scenes were great but not that memorable. Other than that, the background music/rest of the soundtrack did not make a lasting impact.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
I don’t know what to say about this except for the fact that everything was pretty generic. There was also very minimal character development/getting to understand the characters. I wasn’t attached to anyone, and I was not impressed.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
While I still stand by the fact that The God of High School was a let-down, I’m not going to lie and say I was completely unengaged. The execution still sucked no matter how you look at it, but I didn’t mind watching it and never felt an urge to drop it.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4<br />
I don’t think I would stop anyone from watching this anime, but I will definitely never recommend it.

    The second webtoon anime comes to a close. Definitely say I liked this one better than the previous. God of High School does have some problems no doubt but I enjoyed this anime so damn much. Didn&#039;t quite know what was coming with this show other than a big tournament and some cool looking fights. Well we got that in spades and then some! This show didn&#039;t let up off the throttle for even a half second! Kept going and going and going jumping the shark at every turn and I loved for doing that. Where we started and where we ended were completely different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357983">
        places in such a short amount of time but that didn&#039;t bother me so much, least not as much as I&#039;m sure it did others. <br />
<br />
The way I value and rare anime is absolutely themes then characters then story then visuals. That being said I think this show is one of the rare exceptions for me. Because the themes and story aren&#039;t quite there imo but holy hell are the visuals amazing to look at constantly and the characters are a lot of fun. There&#039;s tropes out the woodwork with this but it didn&#039;t seem to bother me. The story kinda shoots itself in the foot multiple times but skimming past things that should probably be explained. This is definitely one that would benefit from being 23 to 26 episodes opposed to just the 13 we got. But not gonna judge something by what it didn&#039;t give us since that&#039;s dumb. Better to just look at what were got and judge that. <br />
<br />
So I&#039;ll say the characters are awesome and easy to root for. Our main trio of Mori, Daewi, and Mira are all badass who I love to see on screen. They all get great moments to shine throughout the show. Even with Mori being centerpiece the other two still get highlights. The supporting cast with Ilpyo being my favorite of those and the other tournament competitors being pretty cool especially early on. Park Mujin was always a mysterious dude who seemed to be up to his own thing but I liked his style and how he helped the trio out more towards the end. His squad with the commissioners and SIX were cool. Nox as a main antagonist group were kinda meh since they didn&#039;t do a whole lot. Jegal however I really liked the more we saw him. An easy villain to despise and want to see the heroes beat. His powers were cool too. <br />
<br />
Of course I&#039;d be dumb to not rave and gush over the incredible animation. Mappa basically outdid themselves and keep putting out quality work over and over again. Can always trust them to make a show look great with its fights and this amps me up even more to see Jujutsu Kaisen animated later this week! Overall I&#039;d say this is a fun kinda just enjoy the fights type anime with some good characters and a middling plot that coulda just used some more time to flesh out. But I thoroughly enjoyed this show for what it gave us. 85 out of 100.

    This is a review based on the first 4 chapters. It is worth mentioning that I have not read the manhwa of this anime.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps you to understand all the points of this anime and be encouraged to see it.<br />
<br />
Remember, all anime / manga can be enjoyed without problems, do not get carried away by bad comments and in case of comparing with another work that is not in order to devalue a job.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story / Plot: 8/10<br />
<br />
At first glance, history is not the most innovative, but it does not mean that great things cannot be achieved. A tournament full of arts and fighting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350097">
        styles of all kinds, where the winner will have whatever wishes they have. The goal of the tournament is to find the best fighter in all of Korea.<br />
<br />
The tournament is sponsored by a mysterious organization and full of strong people, surely more groups will appear<br />
<br />
At the moment little else can be said, it is clear that the story will be complicated and will have more aggregates, but for the moment it can be summarized by saying, in this world there are unusual things and people with superhuman abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters / Personalities: 8/10<br />
<br />
The protagonist, Jin, Mo-Ri, is the typical student with a very happy character and who conveys that. He is a very strong person who enjoys fighting against others and at all times is looking for someone powerful to face, yes, how Goku. Regarding his past, we know that he was very close to his grandfather and was a person with few friends.<br />
<br />
Han Dae-Wi is a calm and confident looking boy. As can be seen in fights, it has enormous strength and resistance and uses it to fight, its main attacks being simple fists, but with a lot of power. Not much is known about him from his past, we only know that he participates in the tournament to get money and help a close friend who is hospitalized.<br />
<br />
Yu Mi-Ra, the waifu from the anime, is a nice and strong girl, who participates in the tournament with the aim of reviving her dojo. As with other people, not much is known about her past, only that her sword is the only thing she has left to remember her father.<br />
<br />
<br />
Animation / Setting: 10/10<br />
<br />
The studio in charge of bringing us this anime is MAPPA, which we all know in installments like: Kakegurui, Dorohedoro and soon for Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season.<br />
<br />
The anime is set in a modern and impeccable city, in which the technology is a little more advanced than the current one, at least in medical terms, what it looks like to heal the protagonist&#039;s broken neck in a matter of seconds using &quot;nanomachines&quot;, which are found in the bodies of each participant.<br />
<br />
The animation stays well at all times, from when the protagonist walks to the moment when he confronts someone. Sometimes it seems that they ignore the laws of physics, it can be seen when they perform certain movements where, being in the air they move a lot from their initial position, but this is understandable when remembering that superhuman movements are possible in this world.<br />
<br />
The physical appearance and clothing of the characters is quite good and is not very far from reality, most characters dress in typical clothing, although in some cases it is observed that certain people dress according to their fighting style.<br />
<br />
There are also funny details like how most characters, if not all, have red nose tips and even ear tips, which is quite funny, but after all you get used to it. After all, it&#039;s not a big deal, but it can serve as a way to recognize anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
This section stands out a lot in this anime since it has a more than acceptable performance and brings with it two magnificent songs.<br />
<br />
The opening theme, &quot;Contradiction,&quot; is mostly electronic, quite catchy, and blends in perfectly with the anime, as stated in a nutshell it&#039;s chilling and entertaining enough to keep you in your seat and not ignore it. It is also important to mention that it is very well done, for example, when it reaches the climax it feels &quot;explosive&quot; which combines with the theme of fighting in the anime.<br />
<br />
In the same way, the ending theme is mainly electronic, contrary to the opening theme, this at all times remains &quot;constant&quot; and &quot;calm&quot;, it serves to appease after almost being absorbed by your seat and how excited the chapter was, But it does not make you lose that emotion, it makes you have your feet on the ground and your body relaxed, it creates an atmosphere of satisfaction and tranquility.<br />
<br />
In terms of setting in all types of scene, the sounds and / or music are according to the situation, it is a perfect way to make you get even more into the story and share what the characters feel. Likewise, in the fight scenes the music used and the expected sounds are adequate. It is worth mentioning that they adequately handle momentary ups and downs of tones at specific times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy: 10/10<br />
<br />
This anime is undoubtedly a show that anyone can see without needing to be a lover of anime or a specific genre. Age doesn&#039;t matter either.<br />
<br />
It may be your first or 156 anime seen but you will surely entertain yourself and give it a good score. As I mentioned earlier in the different sections of the anime, it does not disappoint in any, it is quite complete and has a lot of quality in between.<br />
<br />
The anime so far is not exceeded in any sense and / or aspect so you should not fear that it deviates from its main plot or there is much inappropriate content, in every sense. There is almost no presence of NSFW content intended to &quot;wake up&quot; the public, or gore or something similar in battles. So far only bruises or light bleeding are seen, which is consistent with the confrontations and blows received by the participants, we must remember that their resistance is superhuman and that means receiving blows strong enough to break walls as if nothing.<br />
<br />
Seeing this anime I assure you epic moments, fluid and detailed animation, perfect sound at all times and a story and characters that will progress and will result in a more complex story and characters with a lot of background.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for using some minutes of your busy day and reading my review, I hope you liked it and cheer you up to watch the anime.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to write me, I will respond after an hour or so.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day<br />

    So, it’s finally here and man what a fantastic adaptation this is coming strong with fluid animation that allows you to nicely follow what’s happening in the fight scenes. And surprisingly I enjoying the comedy here even though I didn’t really love it in the webtoon, it seems they made to push the punchiness of the jokes and made sure to give them hilarious facial expressions, they come and go quick which is always nice. They also make sure to keep a lot of the visual gags like Q getting owned in episode 2 which I superbly loved. <br />
Story:9 As for the story, similar to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350100">
        tower of god this is the first arc of a really long, epic of a manhwa which story becomes far bigger so though it might seem a little slow you should definitely keep with it as long as the concepts and action interest you. Think of it maybe like the first season of Bleach which is more comedy focused and not too much action, though GOH makes sure that there is more than enough action to go around since it starts with a fighting tournament. As it goes on, the comedy elements will be toned down in quantity so if they aren’t your cup of tea don’t worry too much. <br />
Adaptation differences: 2 quick things I would like to note are that they haven’t changed much story aspects which is promising only changing one minor detail which honestly doesn’t make to much sense in the long run of the manhwa and a few story beats like how Mori gets the divine pellet or wrestler girl gets genuinely defeated. The one big difference is that they are making sure to hint at the super power aspect a lot more which is good since it becomes the central way of fighting later on. <br />
I also like that they make sure that all these characters are somewhat superhuman in their actions with the quickness of the fights since initially that quality was sort of hard to notice in the webtoons. <br />
Overall: 10 It’s a fantastic shounen action show that provides beautiful fight animation with a long, epic story with really lovable characters that I promise you won’t regret getting into especially if you’re looking for a good to scratch that action itch. Honestly this and TOG will probably become part of the next big three as long as their adaptation release schedules aren’t too spaced out.<br />
Other quicky ratings<br />
Art:10 Gorgeous fight animation with good in-between choreography making the fights more dynamic also loving the expressions and like that they took out most of the chibi comedy focusing on the big jokes.<br />
Sound: 9 Love the impact sounds though think some of the explosions are a little over done also didn’t expect that opening theme.<br />
Character:10 Loving that they are making sure to push the main trios friendship, making sure to not skip any beats and think they are doing the side characters well.<br />
Enjoyment:10 I’m loving this baby<br />

    In my eyes, the main glaring issue with The God of High School is its exhausting usage of lifeless tropes and played out, predictable scenarios, along with its lack of any real attempt to contribute meaningful depth to them.<br />
Tropes don&#039;t automatically make a show bad, but in this case, they&#039;re heavily relied on without adding anything of significant value, leading to flat characters, monotonous dialogue, and a tedious narrative that struggles to convince me it&#039;s worth getting invested in and caring about. <br />
To best get across where I&#039;m coming from, I&#039;m going to write this review in the format of a satirical “how-to” guide, with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350129">
        &quot;instructions,&quot; on how you can quickly write up a similarly unimaginative story. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
• Although I&#039;ll have watched 4 episodes at the time of posting this, I&#039;m writing the entirety of the rest of the review after only having watched the first 2 episodes. I also have not read the original work. <br />
• A telltale sign of a story with tired tropes and lackluster imagination is when after one or two episodes, you can more or less see where a show is heading in general, which is why I thought writing a &quot;how-to write this&quot; after watching the very beginning would get my point across well.<br />
• The idea is that if the review and predictions hold up after watching episode 4, I&#039;ll post this (well obviously if you&#039;re reading), but if most of what I ramble about misses the mark, I&#039;ll scrap it instead, and might actually enjoy myself. <br />
• If I post this, I&#039;ll leave some edits in sections that I felt I didn&#039;t do justice if they come up.<br />
• In terms of why I haven&#039;t outright dropped it yet, I plan to continue to see if it improves (and to see if it plays out how I think it will), but as its start has proven to be quite underwhelming and packed with tiresome clichés, I probably won&#039;t get much farther. <br />
• Given that I’ve only watched 2 episodes, this review is technically spoiler free (outside of the very beginning), but be aware that I do make educated guesses on how the story will end up playing out (very generally) based on the formulaic beginning, so read at your own risk of me potentially guessing correctly. My assumptions could be completely off, but I am fairly confident that my thousands of hours spent watching anime and entertainment in general won’t let me down (hurray for escapism).<br />
• To preface; the animation, voice acting, etc. are perfectly fine, if not above average, but as a viewer, I tend to evaluate characters and narrative on a completely different playing field, where the former can only add real merit to a show if the latter follows through first.<br />
<br />
Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get started with the wikiHow guide!<br />
<br />
<br />
How to write the introductory episodes of The God of High School, or a similarly clichéd series:<br />
<br />
(1) At the very beginning of the first episode, briefly show the (seemingly obvious) main antagonist-type character of the series, in order to highlight him as being super powerful and awe-inspiring to build up &quot;anticipation.&quot; &lt;-(sarcasm)<br />
• Again, at the start of episode 2, portray him intimidating authority figures with the superiority-complex attitude of an egotistical teenager, to show how much influence/power he has, and more importantly, how cool he is.<br />
• 99% sure this character will fit the “all according to plan” mastermind trope, but only time will tell.<br />
<br />
(2) Introduce the protagonist as an always-bright, simple-minded type whose driving motivation is just wanting to fight and get stronger!<br />
• Start off with a flashback from his childhood, where his endearing father-figure/master (who is obviously a badass because of the scars on his hand) is doting on him, and telling him to &quot;make sure to go to school and make friends, because that&#039;s what&#039;s truly important.&quot; The kid of course cries and yells that he promises. And you can&#039;t have a scene where a character cries unless it&#039;s raining (perfect example: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, when Mustang is shown crying, it is very obviously RAINING).<br />
• This father-figure is probably some amazing fighter or was some kind of legend, which makes the main character all that more special, having been trained or raised by him.<br />
• Also, just want to emphasize that nobody would ever expect an exposition dump at the beginning of a show to be just the character&#039;s dream! And they broke their alarm clock, so they&#039;re late to an important narrative event?! Genius! Take notes writers! <br />
• Exposition with news reports airing on the side of a building, random students on a train, and strangers at a knock-off starbucks? Couldn&#039;t think of a better way of portraying a setting to the viewer (on top of the dream!).<br />
• I also can&#039;t give the studio enough credit for making him yell constantly, music to my ears.<br />
• He is always pulling hilarious dim-witted stunts like driving his bike off a cliff because he is late for school, where we see him being lovingly scolded by a neighboring old lady, who he playfully waves to, showing us how he is known for being the lovable ditz everyone just adores (have never seen a shounen-esque protagonist with these traits, mind-blowing stuff).<br />
• To contrast his usual lighthearted attitude, have him get dead serious when he sees some kind of injustice, or someone hurts his friend.<br />
• Inexplicably strong, yet thin, agile, and young main characters, who are 20x stronger than people who have been bodybuilding for decades? Check!<br />
<br />
(3) Introduce the second main character as a quirky type who can typically be found brutally assaulting the main character for comedic relief.<br />
• Slap that character with the “must keep the family tradition/business alive” cliché motivation and call it a day.<br />
• Give her an out-of-character scene where she snaps after briefly losing an item extremely important to her (make sure to slip in the family tradition motivation explanation here, as the sentimental value of the item is directly attached to her motivation). She gets serious about losing something tied to her motivation? Profound.<br />
<br />
(4) Introduce the third main character as a down-to-earth type, and have him explain his driving motivation to be “for the money;” only being a half-truth, the scene is accompanied by “foreshadowing” visuals that imply something deeper behind that motivation. In general, this character acts much more like an actual human being than the bright eccentric and the quirky domestic abuser.<br />
• My guess is that this character needs the money to pay the medical bills for a friend/family member who has some kind of illness that can only be cured for an insane amount of money, but that’s just a theory.<br />
• As a note, I don’t believe this character is all that poorly crafted. Sure maybe a bit uninspired, but not necessarily bad. However, the fact that the show makes it blatantly obvious that the money motivation is tied to some kind of medical situation by showing flashbacks of a hospital hallway immediately destroys any intrigue that potential foreshadowing could have produced.<br />
- Edit: At the end of the 4th episode, they throw in a bit of an unexpected chain of events dealing with this character, which I actually really liked, and improved my outlook/view of the show from like a 2 to a 3 so far. It&#039;s good, but it&#039;s the kind of good that stands out as the one thing that&#039;s impressed me, whereas honestly since writing this, everything else has turned out even worse than I expected. While the &quot;guy finally snaps after loved one gets talked shit about enough&quot; scenario is super common, I still consider this rendition to be interesting.<br />
<br />
(5) Make all of the God of High School contestants extremely specific with their excessive quirks and fighting styles, to the point where it starts being comedic for all the wrong reasons.<br />
• Perhaps include a hyper-intelligent kid (with glasses of course, how could someone smart not have glasses in anime?) who casually reads while beating people up in order to show the viewer just how composed and skilled he is.<br />
• Throw in a barely clothed, hair-dyed, bubblegum-popping female fighter, because why not.<br />
• The announcer character has to have a notably bizarre-looking character design, especially when it comes to the facial features. He has to be painfully over-the-top, and provide you with way too much exposition!<br />
<br />
(6) Introduce an initial villainous character (who will eventually become inconsequential) as dark, edgy, and maniacal. Give him some kind of dangerous power he obtained from an evil organization in exchange for his sanity, in order to get stronger after some kind of awful humiliation, likely in the form of being wronged by the “system.”<br />
• Another instance of potential intrigue being destroyed by “foreshadowing” flashbacks, which in reality, rather than vaguely hinting at something important soon to come, flat-out give you all of the information you need to figure out where the plot is headed.<br />
<br />
(7) Introduce a character with the sole purpose of being cannon fodder to show how strong and fearsome the villainous character is.<br />
• Make him out to be a warrior of justice itself, and a seemingly strong, calm, and collected one at that, such that when he starts fighting the villain, it initially seems like he has the upper hand. However, after an “unexpected” turn of events, the villainous character “surprisingly” overpowers him, proceeding to flaunt his fearsomeness by psychotically torturing the cannon fodder.<br />
• Have the protagonist jump in when he sees this injustice and take on the villainous character, showing just how powerful and serious the supposedly carefree character can be when confronted with such a situation.<br />
• Have this interference be “against the rules,” yet the protagonist does it without regrets anyways because of his strong sense of justice. The protagonist immediately proves how much more powerful than the cannon fodder he is, by contending with the villain on a level playing field. However, right as the protagonist seems to have won, the villain snaps and starts to bring out that mysterious dark power, and right as he is about to take the protagonist out with it, a much more powerful third party (likely with a high position in the “system”), prevents the fight from continuing, as the story can’t exactly continue with the protagonist dropping dead in the first 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
(8) Whenever fighting, you absolutely must have one of the characters watching from the sidelines simultaneously explaining to the viewer exactly what is happening in the fight, what moves are being made by who, and for what purpose. Remember, this is the most exciting part of a fight scene.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can only hope that I’m totally off the mark here, because believe it or not, I actually like when I enjoy the entertainment I consume. However, it doesn’t seem likely in this case unfortunately.<br />
I believe the beginning of a show is one of the most important parts, and am not the type to deem a show worth “bearing through” the first sub-par episodes to get to “the good part,” but I&#039;ll probably watch at least a couple more episodes in the name of giving it a chance.

<br />
Story: 1/10 - It&#039;s awful. Just another &quot;Do this to make a wish&quot; cliche. Also, it tries to look deep by including religious imagary but just fails everytime. And some of them can make their wish easily without going into the tournament.<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10 - It&#039;s so bad to look at. The designs suck. It had decent fight ceography I guess, but even then it steals the opening&#039;s animation and just use it in episodes.... oh wow.<br />
<br />
Sound: 1/10 - I had sound off but I know it&#039;ll sound bad.<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350183">
        = They&#039;re paper thin and are cliche, I&#039;m pretty sure the mc is mentally handicapped and still needs help using the bathroom despite him being in his teens. The second mc is rule 34 bait and the second guy is just a poor man&#039;s version of Leorio<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10 - I had a headache watching it. I mean seriously.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10 - Do NOT watch it, it&#039;s badly paced, has weird cuts and is a bad fever dream nightmare to watch through<br />

    3 episodes in and you realize this show is the epitome of &quot;all flash, no substance.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is less an anime and more like a 20 minute anime fight scene compilation from YouTube.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing to this series. It&#039;s soulless and boring. There is almost no plot to understand. 4 episodes and you learn nothing substantial of the main characters, why this fighting tournament exists and the other characters&#039; motivations, especially the villain who behaves like a typical Korean drama evil business man but with super fighting powers.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I don&#039;t know how much harder I could come down on a show lmao. What a disappointment.<br />
<br />
The show tries

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350144">
        to rely on mystery to keep you interested, but does it so poorly it&#039;s like dangling a carrot on a stick, but you forgot the carrot. Things just move as fast as possible and that speaks to its pacing. The anime is cutting things from an already shallow manhwa.<br />
<br />
And what&#039;s worse is that, since this show has literally almost no plot 3 episodes in, you can just tell that the overall story is shallow and creatively bankrupt. And don&#039;t listen to people telling you to read the manhwa or webtoon. The source material is actually worse than the anime, and I just ripped the anime apart, so that should tell you something. The anime literally cut out chunks of plot just to jump from fight to fight in breakneck speeds, and you&#039;re just following along. You have no care for any of these fights because they&#039;re happening without any attachment from you as a viewer with the characters.<br />
<br />
For comparison, My Hero Academia isn&#039;t anything special, but even people who dislike it could admit it has a passable story that follows Hook -&gt; Line -&gt; Cliffhanger (optional) -&gt; Sinker. God of High School has no Hook, a small Line, and then the weakest Sinkers (if you can even call them that) because there was nothing to hook you into the show in the first place! You might be hooked by the flashy fights and the EDM music for the first episode in a half but then its novelty wears off and you&#039;re left wondering what the hell is the actual story. Oh, the villain is suddenly interested in the MC? Damn, I wish I was too. Seriously, in 3 episodes you couldn&#039;t have spent more time growing Jin Mori with the viewers rather than showing off as many matches as possible?<br />
<br />
At least the fighting is flashy enough. At least it was until the show decided to crank up everyone&#039;s strength as fast as possible without warning and the way the story is paced, you can just tell there&#039;s no ceiling and characters will just get more and more powerful. On a visual level, they have characters summoning Shaman King JoJo stands, which may just be imagery for the viewers to show off the characters&#039; power levels, but if you&#039;re gonna do that you can&#039;t not give the main character something similar and then have everyone claiming the MC&#039;s power is not human. The other guy just summoned a giant monster behind him and you&#039;re impressed by the MC throwing 3 kicks? Where&#039;s the visual consistency? You just gave the MC a power boost 7 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
The only good thing in this show was Mah Miseon &#039;cause she got abs and big anime tiddies.

    I would describe The God of High School as the hentai of the action genre, you come to watch people fighting without caring about who is there and why are they doing it.<br />
<br />
The story seems a secondary priority, character introductions are non existent.<br />
Our main character is Jin, your typical shonen protagonist who is insanely strong, on his way he meets with Mira and Dawei becoming friends pretty fast.<br />
We start the first few episodes with people fighting and random superpowers everywhere.<br />
On the tournament we have people using martial arts, weapons and wide variety of superpowers that we have no knowledge of their origin.<br />
If I were to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350120">
        think about the plot, nothing really makes sense.<br />
<br />
It bothered me that a story this shallow would make it that far so I jumped onto the webtoon and I was pretty surprised.<br />
The anime did its best to crop as much as possible from the characters backstory, it looks as if this anime was made so that people who previously read the story would enjoy some of its action come to life.<br />
 <br />
To its credit, the animation is better than anything that came out this season, the art style is beautiful and fighting scenes are great.<br />
Sound, opening and ending were good.<br />
<br />
Overall its not a bad anime, but it could be if the viewer cares about the story and had no previous knowledge of the webtoon.

    GoH so far has done a lot of things right in my book. The opening episode really draws you into the show, and really gets you hooked on the three main characters and who they are. For a show to do something like that, you know it&#039;s gonna be good, and worth your while. But what else does GoH have in store for the first few episodes? Let&#039;s see...<br />
<br />
As I touched upon with the characters, the first episode does a great job of building them and showing just who they are, and how fun, and interesting each can be. You&#039;ll find yourself cheering for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350105">
        three mains because of it, and only wanting the best for them. For a show to have great and entertaining characters, you know it&#039;s going to be good.<br />
<br />
As for the story itself? Just think of your usual fighting game that you love, and how they run their tournaments. Each character having a motive and a story behind from, which stories can range depending on the character of course, and I cannot wait to learn more about them. Much like how they give off that interested factors towards those who are running this tournament in the first place. Well done there.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s art style can be very flashy at points, but also fitting for more darker moments. For it to be done like that, it really is something. Much like the sound through out the show, when it&#039;s flashy, it&#039;s upbeat and good fun, and fits the tone of the show when needed. Both quality in my book, and will keep you throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Overall so far GoH is a fun show, that can make you go through the emotions so far, and I cannot wait for more, and you should watch too!

    It has become apparent now that webtoon anime has become a failed experiment. The concept of adapting these highly praise webtoon series was amazing as we viewers get to see South Korea based anime. It was frankly a breath of fresh air as the webtoon catalogue is filled with various genres that were produced by passionate authors that cared about their works even if the works vary in quality. Unfortunately, the overall execution has been bad, really, really bad.<br />
<br />
Tower Of God was released in the Spring 20 anime season in an awful and unfinished state filled with non-existent worldbuilding, laughable power system, empty characters, outstanding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358009">
        awful production values and horrendous writing. It was a series that I deeply despise to the core it made me wonder if the source material was bad but, I have been told that Webtoon itself was good and the anime was an utter bastardization to the source material. Honestly, if Crunchyroll did not hamfist the living crap of the show right down my throat on social media then I wouldn&#039;t have hated it all that much. Sure I still would have heavily disliked, but I wouldn&#039;t have it in my top 30 worst anime I&#039;ve ever completed list.<br />
<br />
One season later The God Of High School was released, and it sucked. It like Crunchyroll never learned their lesson with Tower Of God and decided to crank up to 11 and that is sad as I really wanted to like it as I love my shounen animes like this.<br />
<br />
Before I go over all the problems about The God Of High School I will be talking about the good as there&#039;s a quite a bit of good in it that prevents it from being in my worst anime list.<br />
<br />
What The God Of High School Does Right.<br />
The art and animation by Studio MAPPA are fantastic as always. Character designs and colourful and distinctive from each other.<br />
<br />
There were some rough scenes every now especially towards the end with the jarring use of CGI but the show still remains consistent with its art style and animation. This is one of Mappa finest works when it comes to art and animation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fights scenes are excellent and really gives the fights series justice that they deserve.<br />
Special mention goes to the Jin and Hau fight in episode 5 that&#039;s filled with a lot of cool sakuga that resembles a comic book.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is generally good all around and fits the tone of the series.<br />
The opening and ending themes are okay I guess, and they decently fit the tone of the series.<br />
Also, both the sub and dub are amazing.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much it really.<br />
What The God Of High School does wrong.<br />
Where do I even begin with The God Of High School maybe with the characters?<br />
<br />
The main 3 characters look very promising and appealing on the surface however the moment, they started talking, my positive expectations went down the drain.<br />
<br />
I grandly feel bad for both the Seiyuus and the English Dub for wasting their amazing talents voicing these shells of characters.<br />
Jin is basically Goku 2.0 who loves fighting. Other than his generic dad backstory, there&#039;s nothing special about him, and his character design reflects that.<br />
Yu is your typical tsundere glasses action girl that wants to find a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline.<br />
Han is the typical quiet hard-working third well of the trio who wants to save a friend life.<br />
 <br />
On paper, the trio had the potential to be fascinating and charming characters but the horrible pacing and especially later on the writing don&#039;t give these characters justice, as a result, these main trios feel empty and half baked. I wanted to see these three go past their character traits so I could love them but they sadly don&#039;t. This is what happens when you have crappy pacing that moves at a rapid pace where you don&#039;t have time to develop your characters.<br />
<br />
As for the story itself well it has no story to speak off. It&#039;s just a bunch of one-dimensional character entering The God Of High School tournament because self insert cliché … backstories<br />
<br />
There&#039;s nothing more beyond that. Now, this wouldn&#039;t have been a problem if the characters were fun or at the very least interesting but their not. As I stated before Jin, Hau and Yu bland characters but the side characters are the worst in fact calling them characters would be a massive insult as their actually like robots that are specially programmed to fight while ditching spit out they self insert backstories by inserting robot voice clip. They are that empty. Due to the characters being empty shells the show becomes a depressing slog filled with abysmal writing. Non-existent worldbuilding, a messy power system that goes out of control half way in, endless meaningless flashbacks that only exist to break the pacing of the fights that are happening, unfunny chibi comedy, annoying tonal that are on par with Your Lie in April, consent asspulls, cheap power-ups, lack of overall stakes, tired shounen tropes and cliches up the ass I could go on.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s a perfect example of this empty writing is how the main three grow a bond with each other. Jin meets Yu by accident during a chase of the thief. Yu yells at Jin for breaking her glasses, A couple of minutes later in the case Hau stops bag thief, and they&#039;re all introduced themselves before the qualifiers started in the waiting room. After the qualifiers the main three argue with each other yet again then Jin accidentally throws Yu family sword in the river causing Yu to get pissed off at Jin telling him to back off. Then Jin comes to help find Yu looking for her sword in the river giving her light to make it easier to find it then moments later Hau joins in the search to find Yu&#039;s sword by bringing in a big light that brightens the rivers in a large scale.<br />
This is on paper is great having our main leads look for the sword as well reconciling with each other through inspiring dialogue that builds an eventually creating unbreakable bond and to its credit the show did that in the beginning but the moment when Hau shows up it that intriguing character-driven scene breaks. Instead of the show actually showcasing the trio finding the sword as spending some decent time to get know each other like most character-driven narratives it transitions into a tournament scene in the waiting acting they are best buds.<br />
<br />
This is where The God High School School true intentions start to rear its ugly head that simply does not care about substance.<br />
I really wanted to like these characters as they appeal to me more than anyone of Tower of God especially Yu and Jin but due to terrible directing the anime totally disregards their character writing in favour of fights and, as a result, the story becomes a tedious slog and the characters become empty shells.<br />
<br />
When the show decides to have a story at the very end after a series of soulless fights, you find out it&#039;s so contrived and convoluted you will wonder if a show was written by a 7-year old that has no understanding of writing and pacing.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the pacing my god it&#039;s a disaster. The show moves way too fast to a point where it became hard to comprehend what is even happening.<br />
Keep in mind the target audience for The God Of High School are teenagers who are into shounen&#039;s yet they can&#039;t do that correctly as this show is that empty that&#039;s devoid of passion, effort, and creativity.<br />
<br />
The final insult of The God Of High School is the hamfisted advertisements. For some reason, Crunchyroll thought it will be a smart idea to splatter their and webtoon logos all over the show especially in fighting arenas. I absolutely hated this every time I saw as it felt I was watching an ad and a lazy one on that. This is immersion breaking at it&#039;s finest and it already made the already terrible series even worst. <br />
<br />
The word empty perfectly to describe The God Of High School. It is a show that has nothing going for it other than showcasing fights that barely has any meaning or substance behind it.<br />
<br />
Sure the anime had decent moments but they ultimately don&#039;t save the anime from being terrible. Even though I ended up kinda hating The God Of High School I actually prefer it over Tower Of God. Least the anime despite having a lot of empty moments thanks to horrible pacing least wasn&#039;t completed bored or insulted by it.<br />
<br />
Crunchyroll please just end this failed experiment. If you&#039;re not going to properly adapt your source material then why even bother doing it. You&#039;re just making the source material and yourselves look bad.<br />
Have some pride of and admit defeat

    Everyone knows that feeling when at the end of an anime they give you &quot;F*** you go read the manga&quot; type of ending, well GOH is not that kind of anime.<br />
<br />
GOH is one of the mont popular Webtoons today, and for a reason, it&#039;s damn entertaining, having really cool characters, really cool fights and moves, and all in all a text book type of SHONEN.<br />
<br />
Well this anime studio thought &quot;ok so UNREALISTIC FIGHTING,COOL CHARACTERS,TOURNAMENT, ok we got it&quot; and thats all they did. They just put in a tournament out of nowhere and managed to &quot;adapt&quot; 29 chapters in 4 EPISODES ! ! ! !

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350225">
        They didnt bother with really non important stuff like character introductions,how they even ended up here, details about this tournament, NOTHING. Not only did they cut so many important stuff that happened in those 29 chapters but they even changed the story for no reason.Grandpa was only mentioned in the anime which literaly made people think that he was dead, but in the Webtoon, he makes couple of important appearances(even talks with the MC on the phone)....i can go on and on.<br />
<br />
All in all, as i said in my opening, GOH is not that kind of an anime...<br />
<br />
<br />
IT&#039;S FAR WORSE!!<br />
<br />
i advise all of you who are watching this and u are interested in the story to go read the Webtoon, because you really lose on a ton of information, events that transpire,literaly you need first 3 chapters to realise what kind of baffoonery they did in the anime and see that it&#039;s ONLY role was to advertise the Webtoon. I should have just said that it&#039;s worse than Tokyo Ghoul root A and re s2,instead of all this :D.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    Moderator edit: This review contains spoilers<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
Yeah they fight each other for the promise of getting what ever they want. It&#039;s like superpower Battle Royal. Jin Mori is your typical shounen protagonist, and of course everything is going to go his way, oh and of course he&#039;s related to someone important and has special powers. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does the pacing of the story in this anime move at the speed of <br />
sound? <br />
Sure the fights are cool, but the tournament is almost over in episode 4, <br />
and everyone just gets obliterated. <br />
Mira got &quot;married&quot; faster then a hentai protagonist. <br />
Some could say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350119">
        the plot armor is strong with this one.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
There is no doubt about it, that the animation is amazing. The fight choreograph is simple amazing, and props to the animators for doing such a great job on those. My personal opinion though, is the noses bother me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The intro is pretty good, and the sound effects are there when necessary.   <br />
<br />
Character: 5<br />
Jin Mori is basically the Natsu of GOH. He&#039;s not very serious, but only when he needs to be, likes eating, and can do anything with the power of will and friendship. Mira swings sword good, and Daewi punch good. <br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
This series has potential, but I feel like it was wayyyy over hyped. The art style, and fighting is really the only highlight of this anime. The story needs to pull a 360 and get itself together if it wants a shot at being better then it&#039;s current state.
