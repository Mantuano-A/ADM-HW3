    To put it bluntly, don&#039;t watch Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love 1000%. <br />
<br />
Some exceptions to this rule are as follows: <br />
<br />
- If you&#039;re competing with a friend at a drinking game (drink every time the lead girl stutters, you&#039;ll lose consciousness fast - you&#039;re welcome). <br />
<br />
There are no other exceptions . . . only excruciating elaboration. <br />
<br />
Uta no star prince hyphen sama music note maji love 1000 percent sign (it has not earnt the familiarity of UtaPri with me) is a depressingly high-budget anime of a dating sim aimed towards women. Ostensibly about the power of music, love and friendship, it is, realistically speaking, actually about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53459">
        jack shit. <br />
<br />
Our protagonist is a modern day Yamato Nadeshiko with eyes the colour of soup, who wears a short skirt and can&#039;t do anything by herself, except play piano. So of course she enters a prestigious idol-making music academy (disguised as a gigolo school) where the ratio of male to female students is astonishingly unbalanced. Despite a personality that is as inviting as her pet cactus and terrifying, terrifying eyes she manages to attract several of potential suitors, apparently through magic, or, as yaoi would put it &quot;sex smell&quot;. By the end of this 13 episode series (or, as I like to think of it, six and a half hours of my life I will never get back) Soup-chan has to pick one of the guys to duet with for her graduation audition. Thus the achingly vacuous reverse-harem sausagefest begins.<br />
<br />
Daringly, unlike several music-based anime series that came before it, such as Nodame Cantabile, Detroit Metal City, Beck, K-On!, and so on, Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love 1000% decides to forego having any listenable music tracks in its OST. The OP is as dull as the protagonist&#039;s personality and the ED (which you will hear in various instrumental and acapella forms throughout) is the musical equivalent of putting a cotton bud too far in your ear and experiencing the crippling though dull facial pain that follows. Other tracks in the OST are just forgettable. <br />
<br />
Like a song that&#039;s so cute it angers you, the talented vocal cast in this show fail to shine. Miyuki Sawashiro, for example, is just incessantly irritating as the voice of our main character - and similarly with Mamoru Miyano, as all I wanted to do was give his character a surprise tracheotomy with a pen for that goddamn vibrato he used in every song. It&#039;s the same with the other voice actors, though those two were particularly grating. Most of the male characters, except the slightly shady evil twins and split personalities, of course, have bizarrely high voices in a desperate bid to sound cute. Or maybe there&#039;s an implicit rule that all male Japanese singers are eunuchs, I don&#039;t know. <br />
<br />
The concept of a music academy that caters to exclusively creating idols that sing pop songs, rather than to cultivate actual talent, is an apt metaphor for this anime. <br />
<br />
On the surface the art is pretty, bright and cheerful, but it soon becomes clear how the studio cut corners with the budget - the horrific spasms the male characters experience when dancing, the occasionally over-bright scenes where characters are standing in thick fog though they are indoors, and - I can&#039;t express my anger enough over this - the chibi. It&#039;s like the art director (cunningly disguised as the manager of Death Records) went &quot;bitches love chibi, give them MORE chibi, FUCK!&quot; and that is what they did. If I had a drink every time there was chibi, I would be dead.  <br />
<br />
Though I enjoyed hating this anime, and laughing at the incredible stupidity (talking to her grandmother in her head - presumably her grandmother is dead - presumably that cat has the spirit of her grandmother - did her grandmother just turn into a bishie?), there is a more serious issue with this show. That is, the reason for its very existence - to perpetuate the kind of obsessive fan culture that encourages people to watch pretty boys in every stereotype you can imagine, from sweet to suave and silly to tsundere, have ~subtext~ with each other while still being interested in the [insert yourself here] main role. The same kind of people that would buy the merchandise and image CDs. It leaves a pretty sour taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Much like staring into our lead girl&#039;s eyes, watching this anime, you will realise it has no soul - and that watching it probably devalues your own. Like an egotistical person, the show is admittedly pretty, but, boy, doesn&#039;t it know it.

    O_O Now I&#039;ve seen it all *shoots self* <br />
<br />
Story [7/10]: The concept of having a music academy to train students to become future idols. That itself sounds really interesting. In the 2nd episode there was good development in the story through assignment given to the students where one has to compose other to write lyrics and record it. Alas such challenges were never shown after ep 2. The heroine has been given extra special attention by all the guys right from ep 1 without any reason(maybe typical of a reverse harem). A big letdown. I mean why cant the feelings develop slowly as the days

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39487">
        of all characters together progress. Pace of the story is really slow in terms of development. Episodes are wasted on introducing all the guys (6 + one magical creature/guy perhaps- yeah talking about Cecile) no excitment to watch except seing the bishonens in different angles. The way the story is revealed looks very plastic- unrealistic and made up for visual feast to the girls exclusively. The only other good point storywise is the continuity it has kept from one episode to the next. Inspite of all this I dont know why but I am still continuing to watch the show. So if you are okay with a not too interesting plot development then go on ahead to watch.<br />
<br />
Art [10/10]: No doubt in this. All the guys are awesome. Haruka&#039;s eyes though is a heavy disappointment. I actually avoid looking too much in her eyes (cause then maybe I&#039;ll get hypnotised :P). Background scenery is good. The campus seems really beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound [10/10]: Need I say anything about this. AWESOME SONGS!!!! Just listen to the tunes and you&#039;ll be fluttering like a leaf in the wind. Voice actors all have done a good job for their characters as well. AWESOME SONGS<br />
<br />
Characters [8/10]: All guys have a distinct personality. Though I would have preferred genuinely smiling characters as a change. i mean come on, you cant have an expression like this =.= all the time and expect the audience&#039;s mindset to change forcefully towards the character by suddenly seeing him singing and dancing. Smile is a must while performing (well with expections of course for songs which are supposed to be grim). And it is the only thing that also adds vibrance to the idol image of the character. Still most of the guys have this feature so its all good. and Haruka completely fails to give any impact on screen for me. Her personality is absolutely weak. Even Ringo the supporting character has her screen presence felt.<br />
<br />
Overall [8/10]: I give this ratings because of the following points:<br />
1) Pop music theme. This is the first series which I actually came across with a full fledged pop music theme. Though I agree skip beat also had some of it.<br />
2) Bishounens.<br />
No interesting scenes showing the actual process of training students to be future idols. Though i have to admit songs are groovy in each episode. Wait songs are AWESOME. Amazing grace !!!!!<br />
All in all its the kind of show to get caught up watching in all the hype.

    What you will find in this anime is a group of cute guys who are pros at music.<br />
<br />
~Story: There is nothing particularly special about the plot of UtaPri. It follows the journey of a girl who got accepted to a very extravagant music school. There she met a group of cute guys who gradually got to love her music. This anime is a typical reverse harem. Do not expect to find any major plot twists because UtaPri is quite light-hearted and often uses comedy.<br />
<br />
~Art: The first time I looked at the main girl character, I was like &quot;Why does she have such creepy eyes?!&quot; I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48269">
        have to say the other characters&#039; eyes are less creepy and look more normal. The art of UtaPri really has an elegant tone to it(please excuse the times when they dance like robots). What I really like about the visuals in UtaPri is the colors. There is always a happy feeling in this anime because of the use of a range of colors.<br />
<br />
~Sound: UtaPri is an anime about music. I am sure anyone would be disappointed if this aspect of the anime was not done well. i think that the background soundtrack is quite suitable. The singing however has been the part that I really enjoyed. When people keep asking the question &quot;Can music change the world?&quot;, I really have to give a yes as an answer. I felt that the songs in UtaPri are all quite emotional.<br />
<br />
~Character: Every character has been briefly explored in the anime. I haven&#039;t played the game UtaPri but after reading Wikipedia, I would assume that it is a lot more detailed and the characters are more thoroughly explained. While all sharing the love for music, the characters each have their own distinct personality. Each of the characters is assigned with a certain color. Sometimes, I find that the colors really expresses their personality.<br />
<br />
~Enjoyment: I wouldn&#039;t say that I really like this anime. The only enjoyment I got from watching UtaPri came from the voices. I have to admit that I only watched this anime because Mamoru Miyano starred in it. For me, the singing has made the best moments for me in UtaPri.<br />
<br />
If you like a short anime based around music or enjoys watching a reverse harem  with cute guys, UtaPri is the anime for you.

    I lasted 4 and a half episodes.<br />

Normally, I detest people writing reviews of a show when only a few episodes have been aired, but this is not as much a review as a warning label. To safely watch this show, you must meet two criteria:<br />
<br />
1) You must own and operate a pink training-bra.<br />
2) You must love princes in shiny elf-armour on white unicorns riding across rainbows to carry their ballerina princesses home to watch &quot;days of our lives&quot;, and not at all in an ironic way.<br />
<br />
Males watching this anime will lose all mental and physical manifestations of their masculinity.<br />
<br />
Females watching this anime will have their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40431">
        brains turned into pink marshmallows forever auto-generating cheesy cringe-worthy soap opera dialogue.<br />
<br />
This insidious show gets gradually worse, you are like a poor frog put in a kettle of tepid water. By the time you notice really how hot it is, you are already paralyzed by the water boiling.<br />
<br />
Do not get the idea that the show is so bad that it is somehow funny. It is just bad.<br />
<br />
I weep for the loss of my testicles, who left my body in disgust. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re coming back.

    At surface level this appears to be another reverse-harem otome kind of anime, but it’s actually much better than that. There is a reverse harem element, with all 6 of the guys vying for Haruka&#039;s attention, but there isn’t any actual romance (well, a little), which makes it an oddity amongst the shoujo genre. The biggest draw for me when watching was that Haruka, while still the female party of a massive love-hexagon, doesn’t just fall into the shadows and become a Mary-Sue type character; she’s a great female lead, and without her personality the way that it is, there’s no way any of this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118377">
        would’ve happened. She is the reason things turn out the way they do.<br />
<br />
Of course, the biggest audience for this anime is young females, as there are many sexy guys, and each of them has their own distinct personality, some clashing violently with others, some of which are not very common in shoujo anime: the obliviously innocent one, the stoic serious one, the childish-yet-yandere one, the tsundere, the ladies man, and the I’m-gonna-close-myself-off-to-you-because-I-don’t-want-your-help-but-I’ll-warm-up-to-you-eventually one. And each one of them is hot as hell. (There’s also plenty of room for yaoi ships, which is a plus but doesn’t draw interest away from the actual plot.)<br />
<br />
The other supporting characters were great as well. There was the best friend who, while she could be considered prettier than our heroine, doesn’t out-shine her but instead plays a big role just as being her friend. There’s the headmaster, who… I just don’t know with this guy. And there’s a trap character! Haruka’s teacher is a crossdresser, and boy does he make an attractive lady. Other sub-characters are interesting as well, and I’m glad that they weren’t just there to be, well, there.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, it’s very smooth and pretty. Characters are well fleshed-out and look amazing (Haruka has the prettiest eyes on any anime female ever and you can’t tell me otherwise), and the plot is decent. In fact, the plot is not very good compared to how amazing the rest of it is. There are multiple plot holes, parts that don’t make sense, things that move too slow, and the ending has a giant “where the fuck did this come from?” moment (there was something to do with magic and cats and Greek Muses and God damn he’s hot), but overall it wasn’t horrible, there was good comedic moments, and even the minor characters are very interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
Then there’s the music: HOLY HELL is there good music, but in an anime that’s all about music, did you really expect anything less? The opening is good, maybe not the best, but the ending? “Maji Love 1000%” is amazingly good. This is one of the few rare instances where the ending theme out-shines the opening theme, and it makes us sit through the credits every time, just to listen to it all. The music within the show is also great; the songs are straight from the character’s hearts, and they’re sung with such passion that it pulls you in and really makes you listen. <br />
<br />
Overall I think this is definitely worth your time to watch as it&#039;s very interesting and entertaining. <br />

    Uta no Prince-sama was originally a dating simulation game which has been adapted into an anime and manga. It’s a reverse harem which is basically a whole lot of bishi guys, the main female protagonist and her one female friend who really has no point or purpose in being there asides from stopping Nanami from looking like some friendless loser.<br />
So why a 6? It’s not that I hated this anime, in fact most people would thoroughly enjoy it, it’s not bad, but at the same token it’s not great. It has a lot of floors which I just couldn’t look past despite enjoying bishie’s.<br />
First off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41481">
        the whole theme and feeling of the anime is off, it tries to invite you to this real shoujo loving land where the background music is lovey dovey piano pieces, the progression is slow and there is a lot of wide shots, yes its trying to build atmosphere. Yet it fails because as soon as we’ve settled into a shoujo feeling, sitting on clouds, sipping tea mood, we are hit with up beat pop songs, quirky actions from the bishie characters and what appears to be an attempt at a ‘cool’ anime feel.<br />
This really shouldn’t have been done, the mixture of most of the time piano background tunes to pop songs is just really awkward, not to mention after watching the boring Nanami talk about her grandmother for the majority of a shot to suddenly swing to a joke being had by one of the male characters, just kills it. You can’t enjoy that joke because you’ve become so bored by Nanami.<br />
They honestly should have cute out all the over the top shoujo feel and background piano tunes and shortened the shots considerably because a lot of the time while I’m watching Nanami seemingly do nothing I feel like fast forwarding anyway.<br />
Why? Because she’s got to be one of the most boring, lifeless, spineless shoujo character’s I have ever come across. The writers attempt at a sweet, grandma loving girl is completely over the top, and in real life a guy wouldn’t take a second look at a girl who seems like such a blank book.<br />
It really hit me how much I loathed this character in Ren’s episode, while he’s being a prissy weakling ripping his lyrics up into tiny little pieces of paper and letting the wind carry them off this high castle like balcony to the large garden of the academy. (Realistically speaking, such a gust of wind would carry those pieces of paper’s kilometres away...) Nanami perks up ‘I will go find your lyrics for you!’ is she STUPID?! That’s completely impossible! But hey, this is shoujo…nothing is impossible. She spends her whole night finding these pieces of paper until sunrise.<br />
Was this meant to make me feel heart warmed towards her? It did the absolute opposite.<br />
Now, there is a saving grace to this anime, because if I looked past the girl character I could concentrate on the bishi guys, some who are actually pretty damn hilarious. My favourite was instantly Ittoki, he was refreshing and hell we needed it after the first episode of Nanami! Then there was Shou the short and fiery fellow who’s always getting teased by his roommate Natsuki (obsessed with cute small things), who if you take the glasses off of turns into his dark side Satsuki. I adored these characters!<br />
That said I found all the other guys either boring, arrogant or in Ren’s case a total loser.<br />
The art is also pretty damn good, and despite Nanami having no personality to boot she’s good to look at. The artists obviously put a lot of effort into the background and the lighting. So it’s always very aesthetically pleasing.<br />
Finally what kept me hooked asides from those loveable character’s I mentioned was the music! I really loved some of the tunes done by the idols and it left me wondering who sings them in real life. I did bob along in my seat to the songs and rewind to watch them again. I really love how each song matches that character who is singing it, and I always looked forward to the next idol’s song and seeing what they came out with!<br />
Really sorry if this review upsets you hardcore fans, I’m just being honest with my opinions and justifying them the best I can. I will finish watching this series, for those three characters I adore and the idol music! <br />
(But I really, REALLY wish they gave Nanami some kind of quirk!)<br />

    Bad, like I can&#039;t believe I watched this for about 7 episodes bad. LOL! I&#039;m really trying to come up with SOMETHING good about this anime but I just have nothing. <br />
<br />
Let me breakdown how bad this is.<br />
<br />
The lead girl- She has weird eyes and is just plain DULL as dish water! She&#039;s one of those typical goody two shoes girls I can&#039;t stand, the type who tries to please everyone but really she just uses her goodness as an excuse to not make a clear decision so she just strings the guys along. But of course her heart is PURE and therefore she really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47943">
        isn&#039;t stringing anyone along, because she&#039;s soooooo good. I knew i couldn&#039;t watch another episode when everyone had to pair up for a song, one is supposed to write while the other sings, naturally all the guys wanted to team up with her, so what does she do? She picks them all, and she is allowed to do it, never mind that several other song writers would be left with no partner to sing their songs. apparently all the guys want to sing her songs because she is supposed to be so good, but I have yet to hear a song from her that was anything but LAME.<br />
<br />
the guys- Stereotypical dating Sim guys, shallow, with nothing going on but cute looks, of course one or two would have a &quot;deep&quot; past or something, but it&#039;s worn like a fashionable coat, in other words, it&#039;s something the main girl can just smile away.  Not only that, but as shallow and stereotypical as the guys are, they are still more interesting than the girl which leads to a VERY important question...why do they all want her?? She has no personality, she&#039;s boring as hell, her eyes are freaky, and she writes lame songs. but then again the guys are just as lame. Whatever small measure of cool points they had were flushed down the toilet with this ridiculous dance scene that was just laughably bad and no it wasn&#039;t funny on purpose. anyway, if you love boy bands then you might gush and live through the lead girl that pretty much proves that no matter how unexciting you are you too can get a full boy band to desire you but if you want to hear good songs, not laugh yourself to death watching lame dance moves, or not suffer through a freaky eyed boring leading girl, then watch Nana or Beck

    Firstly, I&#039;m sorry about mistakes, English is not my native language.<br />
<br />
Do you know the feeling of forbidden pleasure? Like when you know something is BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD and it&#039;s an insult foryour mind to enjoy it - f.e. Twilight, Jonas Brothers&#039; singing... But you do!  That&#039;s the essence of the whole anime. <br />
<br />
Story is - assumedly - about a life of Nanami Haruka, yellow-eyed typical shoujo girl, who happens to get into famous school for future idols and compositors. Why? Oh, it&#039;s not that she has any ambitions or something. She wants to write a song for Hayato, an idol... who is strangely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41837">
        alike her schoolmate, Ichinose Tokiya. Hayato&#039;s song helped her when she moved to the city... she couldn&#039;t hear her own thoughts but his song? Oh yes, no problem!<br />
<br />
Other characters are also flat like a wall. They&#039;ve got usually one episode/one song/one problem for our cheerful schizophrenic Haruka to solve per person, and within just this one episode they are fascinated with her and simply fall in love. Easy, huh? <br />
<br />
Music can be cool sometimes.  I liked the first song, weird dance and lyrics... So darn catchy! Others are pretty bland, except Satsuki&#039;s (that guy rocks!). I also hate Nanami&#039;s seiyuu. Her constant &quot;eeeh?&quot; drives me mad!<br />
<br />
Art is ok. I liked most of the background and images of main characters... except for Haruka and her stupid eyes. Their constant gaze gives me shiver.<br />
<br />
Over all... I hate to admit that I enjoy watching this stuff. I love permanent cliches, random talks, idiocy of situations... It&#039;s like watching a kid show. You know there&#039;s nothing bad inside that can hurt you. It&#039;s fluffy, cute and makes you laugh... at it. But it&#039;s nice to watch a fairytale from time to time.

    (This is my first review)<br />
<br />
WARNING: Do not watch this show if you have a problem with the following--singing and/or music, harems, or BISHOUNENS!<br />
<br />
When I first heard about this show, I already had suspected that it was going to be a harem, for I had already watched La Corda d&#039;Oro, which also had a musical theme to it. <br />
<br />
However, the only differences... Uta no Prince-Sama Maji Love 1000% doesn&#039;t center around magic, and the talent is all real.<br />
<br />
Story: I gave the story a nine simply because I&#039;ve gotten up to episode 7 and only now has a plot began to unfold. Each of the characters have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41487">
        their own separate back-stories, and they all begin to center around their passions for the main heroine Haruka Nanami.<br />
<br />
Art: Now, I will use my weakness for bishounens to give the art a nine! And not just the guys! The landscaping art out by the patio, the snow scenes, the rain, and even the academy is absolutely breathtaking, and the characters are all well drawn out... My only real flaw in the art? Haruka&#039;s eyes tended to freak me out sometimes. Maybe they colored her eyes a bit too much. Otherwise, I found ways to overlook that.<br />
<br />
Sound: A perfect ten for the sake of song! All of the voice acting was flawless, and the singing... TREMENDOUS. I really admire that they picked the right voice to fit each character--some surprises for me including Yuuichi Nakamura as their teacher: cross-dressing Ringo, Kenichi Suzumura as Masato (Which I didn&#039;t even recognize until I caught a slight hint of his normal &quot;cocky&quot; voice while he was singing), and even Mamoru Miyano as Tokiya! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
Character: A nine! Most of the characters had their own spunk to them, and my overall favorites at this moment are Otoya Ittoki, Masato Hijirikawa, and Tokiya Ichinose (No particular order), simply because their personalities were among some of the most human. My least favorite character? Haruka. She just seems too... plain. I even question how the guys fall for her sometimes. I hope that we get to see more of her true personality during episode 8.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: While there were certain flaws to the story that could be tweaked, and even certain moments that made me go &quot;WHAT WAS THAT?&quot; in an angry tone, I have to say that I overall enjoy this show so far because it&#039;s rather... cute.<br />
<br />
Overall: I&#039;m torn between a nine and a ten because of the character development, but if it solely came down to the sound and the art, the series would be a ten in my book!<br />
<br />

    First of all, I&#039;m sorry if I can&#039;t express my thoughts clearly, because English isn&#039;t my mother language. Well, Utapri... I&#039;ve finished this anime few months ago and suddenly remembering it while I&#039;m browsing MAL, so here we go:<br />
<br />
Story: 4<br />
So here&#039;s the story: a typical shoujo entering a prestigious music school in order to study how to write good music, so she could someday deliver her music for her favorite singer--- what&#039;s his name, to sing. And as the story goes on, she meets lots of your also typical bishounens, and somehow attracted them all. Therefore, she builds her own harem, and by her so-called

          <span style="display: none;" id="review56329">
        wonderful music, she was like, rockin&#039; the world. To me, there&#039;s absolutely nothing special about the story, instead, it was kinda dull. I mean, it&#039;s not realistic at all. And the part where all the boys are just stuck to her is---- ugh, holy. And then, she&#039;s said to be a wonderful composer, but her songs themselves weren&#039;t showed to us back then. She only made one WOAH song and everybody&#039;s going on praising her. Kay.....<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Well, the only good part of this anime is the art. The art is so flashy and colorful with lots of rainbows whenever you watch this. The bishonens are pretty cool. I like almost all of them. The animation is also pretty soft and well, worth praising. On the other hand, I especially disliked the main character&#039;s eyes-- they&#039;re so ugh, scary, freaky, horrible, what do you call it. Can&#039;t they make it more, dunno, alive?<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
This anime is about music, so I was expecting more on the sound... but actually there was nothing impressive at all. Just like what I&#039;ve mentioned above, they should&#039;ve posted more of the main character&#039;s song. And also, the BGMs weren&#039;t special. As the seiyuu... hmm I think it was well-done and they fit the characters (yes, the main chara&#039;s voice really fit her stupid personality).<br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
From all of the aspects of this anime, character makes it the worst. Nanami Haruka, as the main character, didn&#039;t stand out AT ALL. Heck, she doesn&#039;t even have a character. What&#039;s so special about her, what makes her different from all heroines in the other animes, and what even makes us come to like her as the main protagonist? She doesn&#039;t have anything. She stands out just because of her horrifying eyes that gives me thrills whenever she&#039;s being closed-up. She doesn&#039;t even have anything to be liked about. In the other side, all of the guys that liked her all of the sudden are also annoying. They&#039;re all-- duh, your typical wall-display that just appeared to make the anime happier. They don&#039;t also have interesting background/past that makes us sympathizing. To say, all of the characters are just alive for us to see, and not to feel.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7<br />
Despite all of this anime&#039;s stupid mistakes and flaws, this is kinda enjoyable. If you like harem with cool boys with slight of humor, you could watch this. Even though just, beware, that you might hate the main character. Hahahahahaha.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5<br />
This anime doesn&#039;t stand out as a fabulous music anime at all. If you guys are looking for a matured and well composed music-themed anime, I don&#039;t recommend this to you. Because this anime isn&#039;t even about music--- heck, I&#039;m out of words. This anime doesn&#039;t know nothing about music. Well, there were some cute quotes from this anime, but that&#039;s all. There&#039;s nothing we can learn from this. This anime is soo like Kiniro no Corda. If you&#039;re a fan of that series, you can go on and watch this. But if you once watch Nodame Cantabile and want to give this a try, you better don&#039;t get disappointed because this anime is nothing like Nodame Cantabile, which is an awesome music anime.<br />
<br />
So... that&#039;s it?

    Uta no Prince-sama does get a lot of hate, but I am actually going to tell you why I think that it shouldn&#039;t and why it&#039;s underrated by people. But first I will go into the different aspects that make Uta-Pri good.<br />
<br />
First let&#039;s say a bit about myself. I like anime with story and good characters. I will spot these things out quickly. Prince-sama does not have a good story, but characters popped out. But back to me- I do not get influenced by &quot;handsome&quot; men dancing and singing. As much as the guys were attractive to me; I can push that aside and focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103665">
        on everything else.<br />
<br />
Story: Not really much to see here. You have the main girl, Haruka Nanami, a young teen looking to be a composer. She wants to become a composer- something that a lot of background characters in Uta-Pri didn&#039;t seem to want to do. Haruka is naturally talented at picking up music and playing it, but she can&#039;t read music. This takes us to the horrible bullying that takes us to Otoya Ittoki&#039;s &quot;arc&quot;. <br />
During this arc, you see a bit more of Otoya in this. But the story of the arc wasn&#039;t much. We continue on throughout this anime through the guys and how they got that way and so on and so on. <br />
By the end- she has to pick a partner for the Graduation Audition. This was brought up in the very beginning; so it makes sense that this can be counted as the main plot for this anime. Sure it isn&#039;t original and you can find this anywhere. But the pacing done for this and how it was handled &quot;realistically&quot; was perfectly good. They went through it as a team and at the end of the day- Uta-Pri is about friendship and music; which is what was shown by the end. Only other problem with the story is that it did seem like the people were a bit high on music- which is totally fine since music does power the soul.<br />
Story is good, but nothing special. 7/10.<br />
<br />
Art: The art was one of the best parts of Uta no Prince-sama. The guys and girls and minor characters were all done right. Even the background characters had faces which some anime lazily drops out. The art goes through different changes from bright to dark to even a bit choppy. The choppy is the only fault in the art. The choppy is only on the dancing which isn&#039;t shown much- but it does bring it one score down. But besides that-<br />
The art was really great! The character designs are really good and you don&#039;t see it much. Otoya has a similar appearance to Avan Hardins in Valkyira Chronicles 2, but even then- Otoya is more bishie. The design of the men were obviously done to show that they are the main characters. They have weird hair color and stand out from most of the other &quot;generic&quot; guys in the show. They also have pretty boy appearances which we all know- most anime has. <br />
Haruka Nanami and Tomochika Shibuya are really good design wise. Tomochika, Haruka&#039;s friend, is really unique looking. Her poofy red hair with lipstick hasn&#039;t been done quite often. Adding her magenta eyes to the mix- and you got on unique girl. Haruka, the main girl, is stunning in appearance. Her eyes are seen &#039;creepy&#039; by many, but I think they are beautiful. It shows the mysteries the girl does hold into her heart. From her eyes to hair to face shape and all the way to her body- the girl is unique and very well drawn.<br />
I give art 9/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound was another key point in this anime. What would a singing anime be without the sound? The music was heaven in your ears. The voice acting done by the guys in the singing area was done really well. I&#039;m not a fan of japanese voices since I usually watch mine in english, but I did enjoy Uta-Pri&#039;s voices since I thought the singing was done really well.<br />
The background noises like rain and footsteps were done flawlessly. You could hear every little details from the noises to the music that sent chills through your spine. I&#039;m not a big sound person so...<br />
Sound gets a 10/10<br />
<br />
Character: Characters is a big part of Uta-Pri. Most shoujo anime and/or manga don&#039;t really have good characters. Ouran Highschool Host Club&#039;s characters are a bit flat compared to Prince-sama&#039;s. Uta no Prince-sama&#039;s characters were very good, and here is why.<br />
<br />
Haruka Nanami is your &#039;mary-sue&#039; main girl. She doesn&#039;t seem to have much going on with her at first glance and her character seems as shallow as a kid&#039;s pool. But once you get to the end, you realize that she is actually pretty good for a main lead. She has a background story which has been use many a times, but gives it a nice twist with her natural ear for music. She is on her way to &#039;mary-sue&#039; but I don&#039;t think she is one. She is that &quot;flawless&quot; girl, but when you look at Nanami- she has a lot of issues. The girl may have a talent that not much people have (even though I know a lot of people who do in real life) , but she is a kind-hearted girl with deep issues. The anime doesn&#039;t get much into depth with her, but she was frail and her personality is quite cheerful. She isn&#039;t flawless though because a lot of the gossiping teens in that school like to talk smack about her. Haruka&#039;s relationship with each of the characters is touching as well.<br />
<br />
Tokiya Ichinose is the main guy. He is this stoic douchebag in the beginning that I honestly couldn&#039;t stand. He thought he was so cool and thought that he can beat everyone. He didn&#039;t even give Haruka the time of the day and completely ignored some of the others. Tokiya is my favorite character due to the fact that he is the most developed. He goes from a guy I want to punch to a &#039;changed man&#039;. He didn&#039;t do a complete 180 and change everything about himself. He still is a bit &#039;mean&#039; but is actually very kind. He messes with the others and smiles after all this time, and he develops at a nice pace for 13 episodes. Just like the other reverse harem, Tokiya falls for Haruka. Tokiya and Haruka&#039;s relationship is sweet since you was the meanest to her. He didn&#039;t like her and it took awhile until she was the reason for him to open up. Haruka loves Hayato-sama and actually almost picked Tokiya for the mere reason that he was Hayato. Soon realized, Haruka falls for him(friend way) as who he is and decides that even if Hayato saved her life, it was really Tokiya who did.<br />
<br />
Otoya Ittoki is your &#039;genki&#039; guy. He is outgoing and a bit messy as seen from his room. He is light-hearted and full of spirit. He isn&#039;t actually that well written since he doesn&#039;t change much. He&#039;s cheerful as hell in the beginning, but by the end; he&#039;s slightly less. He&#039;s still cheerful as hell which is why Otoya isn&#039;t that well of a character. His personality though is different from usual happy males. He is a bit shy, but outgoing. His personality is hard to describe without it seeming like he is indeed a generic &#039;genki&#039; boy. His relationship with Haruka was by far the sweetest. He made sure to tell people off and even stand up for her. All he wanted was to sing her songs and make her happy. Which he ended up doing; making him extremely close with her.<br />
<br />
Ren Jinguuji isn&#039;t your typical flirty male. From the beginning you thought he was- Especially did I. Ren is actually really developed- even Masato points out that he has changed. He was another douche in the beginning almost all the way until the end, but only difference from him, Tokiya, and Syo is that he is a flirt. Ren was the second best character due to he changed a lot. He was harsh and cold by the end, but changed for the better. He wasn&#039;t going to be bossed by his family for too long, especially since his mom and Haruka were the only reasons he attended the school. Haruka and Ren&#039;s relationship are close friends, but like the others- Ren likes her.<br />
<br />
Natsuki Shinomiya and Syo Kurusu are two teens that get along well- on Natsuki&#039;s side that is. Natsuki is a &#039;kawaii&#039; lover who enjoys all things &#039;kawaii&#039;. He is really outgoing, annoying, and a bit of a weird teen. When his glasses come off, Satsuki is now in control. Satsuki is another douche if he counts- making it a grand total of 6 males in Uta-Pri that are this way. Natsuki seems to enjoy Haruka&#039;s company, but I assume that&#039;s all it is, maybe not love quite yet. Natsuki is the third best character since he is developed. He goes from outgoing to a lot serious and actually takes time to think instead of cute things everywhere. Syo is one of the 6 males that are douchey. Syo is the bishie blond who enjoys having time alone while looking up to his idol. He has a fear of heights from a traumatizing experience involving him and Natsuki when they were younger. Syo gets a lot nicer by the end is actually really sweet. Haruka and Syo have another great friendship. Syo clearly enjoys Haruka&#039;s company and has a crush on her, even thinking that she was the main heroine for his own story involving his idol.<br />
<br />
Masato Hijirikawa is the last main character of this cast. Masato is a serious traditional man. He has the generic strict done in which he somehow gets his father to say yes for letting him go to the academy. His type reminds me a lot of Kyoya Ootori- just not a douche. Masato and Haruka&#039;s relationship is really touching. He probably loves her the 3rd most right after Otoya and Tokiya. Haruka is really grateful since he helped her get past the bullying and do what she loves.<br />
<br />
Minor characters like Tomo, Ringo, Hyuuga, Shining, and Cecil were all important in their own way. They all served a purpose even if they didn&#039;t have much to them. They did help the main cast in getting as far as they did.<br />
Want more of a background story with these characters? Play the game. Characters are very good so they get a 8/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I loved this show and that&#039;s all I have to say. We all have different opinions and minds. You guys may not like it or you may do, either way- we all have a different reason for liking or hating it. So MY enjoyment for this amazing anime was a 9/10... <br />
<br />
Overall: Overall this show was very good with art, sound, and characters. The rounds this all about to a 8/10.<br />
<br />
This was my first review so I hope it was decent enough~<br />

    This review is based on the first two episodes of  Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love 1000%. As more episodes come out, I will edit the review.<br />
<br />
As most people know, Uta No Prince is based on a Visual Novel, (PS2 Game if I am not mistaken.) Involving 6 Bishies. (Bishonen boys.) <br />
<br />
Story: 7 (Based on two episodes.)<br />
<br />
The heroine Nanami enrolls into a school specially for composers and etc. At the entrance exam she is late because on her way she had stopped to help a lost child find their mother. Because of this, the officers do not let her in.  She then meets Ittoki and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38998">
        Ren, who manage to get her in by persuading the officers. <br />
<br />
There is hinted romance currently, but I won&#039;t type it on here because of the spoilers. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, I&#039;m guessing that this anime will be separated into arcs. (Something like Amagami SS or Starry Sky.) Where the heroine (Considering there are 6 male protagonists, each male gets 2 episodes- if the anime ends at the 12th episode.) is with a different male protagonist in each episode (This case, 2?).  <br />
<br />
The story looks pretty consistent, as I have watched Amagami SS, I believe it will suit those who are looking for a light romance anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 7.5<br />
<br />
This included a bit of my personal opinion, as I found Starry Sky&#039;s art more appealing. Either way, the anime has great cell-shaded characters, nicely colored, the body proportions (Oh thank you!) They are consisnt and great throughout the episodes. I have not yet found huge eyes, sudden weird movement, or really skinny fingers and legs during the animation.<br />
<br />
The animation is very smooth and I&#039;m happy to say that the animators aren&#039;t that lazy, as sometimes one of the major flaws of Visual Novels that is turned into an anime is that animators get lazy and use simple skills like scanning e.g to waste time- which Uta No Prince does not have often. The best evidence of great animation is the ED (Was the OP of Episode 1.) <br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
<br />
I was too focused on the settings and the plot to really hear the music in the background, either way, the OP and ED are really appealing and amusing to watch (especially the ED.). <br />
The voice actors did a great job (which can be told just by watching 1 episode.) the character personalities and the voices go together really well, and the singing is just &#039;awesome&#039;. Many of the voice actors have sung before, and I think I&#039;ve heard one of their voices in the &quot;Nico Nico Chorus&quot;. Which just adds more to the sound and voice actors. <br />
<br />
Character:6<br />
<br />
I am hoping to see some good background stories for each of the characters in the arcs, because I have only watched 2 episodes- I cannot rate this any higher than a 6. Some of these characters feel to stereotypical, and after seeing many types of anime- Stereotypes don&#039;t really stand out.<br />
Generally, the character designs are really nice and they seem to have interesting personalities.  <br />
I&#039;m wanting to see how they flip the Stereotypes and create characters that can be remembered and liked. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
<br />
Though I have rated &quot;Enjoyment&quot; higher than the others, this at the end is just a little personal opinion. (I find Shou&#039;s hairstyle awesome xD ) <br />
<br />
<br />
~This anime will satisfy you if you are simply looking for a lighthearted, hinted romance, little comedy and school setting, and if you are searching for something music related- as they do sing :3 (Awfully well.)~<br />
<br />
[Note: Or if you are just looking for some spicy bishies]<br />
<br />
<br />

    Watching this anime was like getting braces tightened; painful to endure and restricting. <br />
<br />
To put it mildly, I did not enjoy this anime. I often found myself dozing off because it was so incredibly dull. I initially tolerated the story line but that was before I actually started to watch it.  This anime was pure torture to watch for me and I am completely amazed that I even managed to finish it. Every episode felt much longer than the approximately twenty four minutes air time. Overall I found it to be extremely tiresome. <br />
I give this anime an one out of ten for its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154615">
        story.<br />
<br />
One word for the art: bleh.<br />
I give the art a two out of ten. <br />
<br />
Moving on, the characters. I measure annoying characters on the scale of one to Haruka. She is a complete door mat and fails to assert herself when it is necessary. I got tired of her little crying fits very quickly. I didn&#039;t like most of the male characters with the exception of Ichinose Tokiya. <br />
I give this anime an one out of ten for the characters. Trust me, I would give this anime a zero out of ten if it were possible.<br />
<br />
Why do I like Ichinose Tokiya? Well because of his seiyuu Mamoru Miyano whom voiced Tamaki Suoh from OHSHC, Sho Fuwa from Skip Beat, Zero Kiryuu from Vampire Knight (incidentally one of the few characters I like from VK), Light Yagami from Death Note and Rin Matsuoka from Free. He is the only reason why I tolerated this anime for so long. As for the soundtrack, what a load of crap. I despise boy bands by nature and the songs were so disgustingly cheesy...I can deal with cheesy songs as long as there are comedic moments. I laughed like once during the course of this anime. <br />
I give this anime a three out of ten for the sound. <br />
<br />
I found this anime to be tedious and dull. There is a second season? Oh I shudder to think...<br />
I give this anime a two out of ten for enjoyment.<br />
If you are a fan of torture, by all means watch away. Also you must receive a thorough diagnosis that you are in fact losing your mind.

Story(7 Good):The story is quite a tipical one for reverse harem animes with the same kind of concept in the reverse harem anime Kiniro no Corda,a girl who goes to a musical school and is surounded by loads of guys who help her on the way to startdom but even if the story is a simple one Uta no prince is so much more because of the enjoyment of watching :D<br />
<br />
Art(9 Great):The characters look all visualy perfect with nice fluid colours and animators that don&#039;t seem to get lazy at any point,the only con

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39333">
        is that the color of the eyes and hair together with main heroine seems a bit odd in the first epiosde but by the second one you get used to it and now I really like the way she&#039;s looks,much better that a  bland main character you get alot in animes these days and can&#039;t understand why there so popular with the other characters. :o<br />
<br />
Sound(10 Outstanding):What can I say,this is a music anime and it dilivers perfect,fun,lovely music,In every episode there is a new song introduced somewhere by one of the male characters  =) <br />
<br />
Characters(9 Great):I love 90% of the characters and the 10% that I didn&#039;t I came to love over the episodes,but if your a guy let me tel you this anime is NOT for you,but if your a girl who enjoys 6 male hot,funny and cool characters then this is your anime. ^^<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(9 Great):Theres both a mixture of funny scenes and sad ones at the apropiate time,thought most of the time i&#039;m smiling when watching it,When I finnish one episode I just want to watch the next one :]<br />
<br />
Overall(10 Outstanding):What more can you ask for from a reverse harem anime,It&#039;s got a mixture of everything to make the perfect anime<br />

    DOKI DOKI de kowaresou 1000%* LOVE HEY!!<br />
<br />
 10 Otoya: Are you ready?<br />
 9  Masato: Are you ready?<br />
 8  Natsuki: Are you ready?<br />
<br />
So are you ready? Ok, now that this 13 episode anime has ended, I probably say that this is one fine musical drama, the plot of this story only plays a minimal role, because like any musical drama show be it live or animated, it is always the climax that&#039;s important co&#039;z the featured song is the climax, and this this case it is &quot;Maji Love 100%&quot; or in English &quot;&#039;True Love 1000%,&quot; so for the story I&#039;ll give it a &quot;Fair&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44201">
        6.  <br />
<br />
Art- Mediocre number 5<br />
<br />
The art of this anime needs no explanation it has similarities with another anime &quot;Starry Sky&quot; with minor adjustments.<br />
<br />
Sound - Great number 9.<br />
<br />
Well, let&#039;s just say that I kinda like all the songs being played in this anime especially the ending theme &quot;Maji Love 1000%.&quot;<br />
<br />
Character- Good number 7.<br />
<br />
The characters in this anime only focuses on Haruka Nanami a girl form the countryside who came to Saotome Academy to study because of her love for music, her personality can be compared to that with another character Kelsi Neilsen from &quot;High School Musical&quot; who is shy and doesn&#039;t have much confidence with herself, however thanks to the support and motivation of friends she was able to find the will to go on, the rating for this anime is actually for her, since it&#039;s all about her and how she struggles with the predicament she has . Since this anime has a harem genre in it, its said genre is actually a reverse harem, but it still follows the usual harem arc where the male members fell for the girl&#039;s (Haruka) simplicity, naivety, sense of compassion and kindness.<br />
<br />
Just who were her harem? Here they are:<br />
<br />
 Hijirikawa Masato - a rich guy groomed to take over his family&#039;s business empire.<br />
<br />
Ichinose Tokiya - a pop idol who goes by the name Hayato who hates being demoted to become a soap opera star, comes to the academy for a fresh start.<br />
<br />
Ittoki Otoya- the first guy Haruka met and the one who motivated her to not give up on her dream.<br />
<br />
Ren Jinguuji- a campus playboy, who is a laid back son of a wealthy businessman. <br />
<br />
Shou Kurusu - a small dude with a great sense of fashion.<br />
<br />
Natsuki Shinomiya - a cheerful individual with 2 personalities, one is the violent Satsuki and the other is the witty and happy Natsuki.<br />
<br />
Of course no harem genre would be complete if Haruka doesn&#039;t have a best friend in Tomochika Shibuya, who always stand by her side. As for rest like:<br />
<br />
Shining Saotome- an enigmatic school principal with the flare for the extravagant.<br />
<br />
Ringo Tsukimiya- the cross-dressing fag who is Haruka&#039;s Homeroom teacher.<br />
<br />
Hyuuga Ryuuya- a teacher every student wanna hates, who happens to be Tokiya&#039;s hoomeroom teacher.<br />
<br />
They serve more like the antagonist, but in a subtle way.<br />
<br />
and there is this dude who dresses like Aladdin, Cecil Aijima,  Info states that he&#039;s the prince of Angapolis and curse to become a cat, but it kinda look like that he&#039;s more of a cameo and a guest singer than anything else in this anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall- good number 7<br />
<br />
What make this enjoyable are the songs especially the ending theme, though this anime also has a romance genre in it, the said genre serves like  a predicament for the main female character, however it did ended like a harem genre would, where it didn&#039;t feature anybody whom the main female lead would pick, but, what really has the big impact in the ending of this anime is the main climax which is the feature song itself which the male seiyu performed well, so.<br />

    I was pretty skeptic about this anime since it was originally an otome game. Don&#039;t get me wrong - I love otome games and I&#039;m huge fan of them, but from the adaption I have seen, the animes has just made it gone downhill.. . proberly from the lack of development like the games and since they have to squeeze this all in 25 mins, it&#039;s impossible to take interest.<br />
<br />
However, Uta No Prince Sama wasn&#039;t what I expected. Take note that I have NEVER played the game ( i have only read reviews).<br />
<br />
Firstly, the main character, Haruka, is your typically shy girl in which everyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177185">
        walks all over.. and most of her actions can be annoying (cue loads of eye rolling). However, throughout the anime, she does have a hidden strength and she does have a goal she wants to achieve. Sometimes you can&#039;t help but appreciate her. I do think, in some ways, Haruka IS a character ANYONE can relate too. The side characters are not too bad either - most of them adding comic or reassurance to the show to make it enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the guys, of course, unlike the game, each episodes can&#039;t express the characters fully, but you do get a grasp on what each of them are like and why they wanted to become idols in the first place. There are some of those typical characters (the cheery idiot, the rich guy, the player, the manly shota, the guy with twin personalities, the guy that&#039;s in too deep etc),  which I am not bothered about tbh, since it made the show enjoyable.  It does sadden me a TINY bit that they missed of some important parts from the game but it didn&#039;t matter too much. It made the show less complicated therefore making the story flow a little bit easier for first time viewers.<br />
<br />
And lastly, putting aside the characters, I think the storyline is done quite well - most of the episodes did link so the plot didn&#039;t love control along the way. The more I watched, the more I was intrigued and found myself singing along to some of the songs. That aside, what I didn&#039;t expect was some... odd paranormal things to happen in this anime, which added the WTF factor, but ehh, shit happens *shrugs*.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I can say this anime is enjoyable and not as bad as it seems. It&#039;s most ideal if you&#039;re looking for nothing too serious. If you&#039;re into shoujos with a light hearted comedy and romance, this anime I could reccomend. I&#039;m not sure if my opinions will differ if I have played the game but all in all I still like this anime. Afterall, they have a second season and in making for the 3rd so I guess it&#039;s all up to you :) <br />

    I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TOO ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSIC, REVERSE HAREM, OR ROMANCE. <br />
<br />
The Story is a 9 because it isn&#039;t anything new,the characters is your standard archetypes nothing too special,  but the overall show is so great its sweet and innocent,the characters personality mix well so there isn&#039;t too much drama it&#039;s takes away from the show, just enough to keep you watching.<br />
<br />
The art and music is fantastic, when there singing and dancing the quality doesn&#039;t go down, A-1 Pictures outdid themselves, the songs are great the voices mix well the couldn&#039;t have asked for better results from the voice actor&#039;s. (i re-watched

          <span style="display: none;" id="review124319">
        6 times.)<br />
<br />
The romance it on the lighter side only adding hints, that&#039;s the biggest problem as i was going though season 1 and 2, I was always yelling &quot;get to the freaking kissing scene&quot; but due to &quot;rules&quot; that won&#039;t happen if that&#039;s what your looking for you won&#039;t find any in S 1 or 2.<br />
<br />
(There will be a 3rd season in 2015 if you like season 1 and 2)

     After watching a few episodes, I came to the conclusion that this anime is extremely corny. Yes, there are many corny anime shows, but this is one of the corniest I have come across. <br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
STORY (3/10): The struggles of the group were kind of silly and melodramatic. It would have been better if each of the members had very different backgrounds and were not all that popular. The struggle would be them working together to become different and reach their dreams in music as a group with Nanami to influence them; Trying to be original yet popular in the process. They should have each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review138235">
        used their own personal talents and abilities to contribute to the group, but they all acted the same. <br />
<br />
<br />
ART (7/10): It was good. Not anything amazing or particularly cinematic about it, but it was very colorful and the characters themselves didn&#039;t look bad. I didn&#039;t care for some of their hairstyles, but that&#039;s my personal preference.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND (3/10): Usually in every anime, I like the music, but with this one, I didn&#039;t find any of the music that good. . . and the show is supposed to be about music. Why don&#039;t I like it? Well, to me it sounds like a generic J pop group with similar songs. It needed more originality. That could have been the reason why they become popular because their music is different from everyone else. The music should of had some sort of twist, maybe to convey the hardships of Starish as a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (4/10): I would most definitely like it more if the characters had more distinct personalities and problems. Sure, each of them were a little different, but I couldn&#039;t find myself being emotionally attached to any of them, and that includes the heroine. <br />
<br />
 I felt like everyone revolved around the heroine and Starish, like the principal, for instance. He followed them everywhere and did all kinds of things for them and I couldn&#039;t help but wonder, &#039;Doesn&#039;t he have an entire music school to run?&#039; Also, the heroine really wasn&#039;t very interesting or relatable when it comes to her dreams and struggles.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say the most developed character in this anime was Ichinose because he changed throughout the season.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (3/10): I was honestly suffering through this anime, trying to force myself to finish it. For some reason, I watched both seasons just to see if it would get any better. It did NOT need another season, I&#039;ll tell you that. It was more annoying than enjoyable. It&#039;s cliche in every way possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL 3/10: If you&#039;re looking for a cute romance, an original plot, deep characters, something moving or emotional... you can look past this one. I find High School Musical to be much more entertaining than this.

    I don&#039;t think that my opinion will change after new series, so I want to write now everything what I think.<br />
<br />
At first if you look at this anime, and you a fan of shoujo you can see a standard plan - girl next door plus a harem of handsome-host-boys.<br />
And music shool of course...stop...where I had watched this?<br />
So she is helping them...ok in result she will choose one of them, or maybe not.<br />
We cant expect more from visual game adaptation.But we will be waiting.<br />
Because OP gives us some teasers.<br />
<br />
I cant have really negative feelings about this anime - the sound is perfect, voice actors - you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40381">
        will hear the best of them!And what marvellous art!The eyes of the characters is really magnetic.<br />
While watching (as I am a girl) I thoght &quot;Why they can&#039;t be real!?Give me on of them!&quot;<br />
So I think this is the best anime of this season.Let&#039;s see what will be in the end ))

    Note this is just for the first two seasons,since I haven&#039;t finished the third yet at the time of writing this.<br />
<br />
Otome from what I&#039;ve seen is really good in anime. Some really think it&#039;s terrible and that they do poor adaptations. I disagree with this especially since there is UtaPri. Some sign it off as dumb but there are great elements here I think don&#039;t get noticed not that  much. <br />
<br />
Story 8<br />
At first it&#039;s simple as they can get and it has a formula that it follows . But there is nothing wrong with that. In both seasons everyone in Starish gets an episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196325">
        to themselves and Haruka also gets some focus. Then the rest of the episodes they try to focus on solving the problem. We know the ending at the first moment but we get to see how. And this works greatly. They also balance comedy and drama nicely . Though at times they dont flesh out world elements greatly.That is the only thing that holds the story back from getting an 9 but look past that and you have a great story.<br />
<br />
Characters 8.5<br />
Hakura is possibly one of the most overhated characters I&#039;ve seen. People always sign her off as useless,dumb, and boring. But without her some of the events in the series wouldn&#039;t happen, she has a personality, motivation ,goal,and helps people. Plus she develops so in other words she is a three dimensional character who is likable.  The other guys also get development and are likable and well rounded. The side characters are fun to see too. Bonds are strong here and almost everyone is likable. Sadly some sides don&#039;t devolp though others do get some development. That&#039;s why it&#039;s an 8.5 and not a 9.<br />
<br />
Animation and art 10<br />
Animation is fluently done,designs stand out ,and it has a color pallet that fits the series. Overall a big highlight to the series. <br />
<br />
Sound 9<br />
There is no dub sadly but the sub is great. Everyone stands out and dose there parts well. The ops and eds are memorable and very nice. The sound track is very good and fitting. The songs the characters sing are great and fit the tone and feelings they have for that song. Overall the sound is great and memorable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10<br />
I really love this series. I can see why some wouldn&#039;t but I enjoyed it till the end.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
<br />
I know it&#039;s not perfect but I love it despite that. I do think it&#039;s worth at least a try if you think it&#039;s worth it.<br />
