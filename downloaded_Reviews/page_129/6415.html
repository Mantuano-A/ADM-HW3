    Anime is like a well-oiled machine.  When all of its parts work harmoniously together (i.e. the story, characters, aesthetics, and the like), you end up with a piece of work that functions well as a piece of entertainment that has a larger majority of its audience responding well to it.  But when there&#039;re sections that don&#039;t really work all that well, then you&#039;ve got a problem.<br />
<br />
Story: With the world dying to the point that it could no longer sustain life, a man known only as &#039;Y&#039; rebuilt it from gears and clockwork, thus creating the &#039;Clockwork Planet&#039; that the characters live in. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250691">
        (Don&#039;t ask me how he did it, the characters themselves don&#039;t even fucking know)  It is here where our dual protagonists come across many wrenches in this world of gears as they try and work out the kinks in the machine.  <br />
<br />
Based entirely on only a few of the story&#039;s beginning arcs, Clockwork Planet is a typical arc-heavy story that relies on different problems arising for our protagonists to deal with, each creating a similar problem in a different way.  These outlandish scenarios act as a double-edged sword for the series as while the plots create a semi-engaging scenario for the audience and provide us a reason to continue watching, the actual logistics for each antagonist&#039;s reason for doing their evil deeds usually don&#039;t really make any sense whatsoever.  Especially with the last arc, a lot of the show&#039;s cogs fall apart because a lot of plot aspects don&#039;t fully mesh well with each other.  <br />
<br />
It&#039;s also important to note that very often the show wastes time with less action-packed scenes and focuses more on comedic or slice-of-life moments that while do help provide a better aspect of life on the clockwork planet, don&#039;t really add much to the story.  Especially since most of the time they shove these parts in the middle of the action, so it creates a jarring shift in tone.  <br />
<br />
All in all, Clockwork Planet was a series that had a rocky start, picked up a little bit in the middle, and then ended with the cogs falling apart again.  Mixed with plot holes (some of which can be ignored to an extent), unclear antagonist motivation, and a surprising amount of choppiness with the story, Clockwork Planet&#039;s story ends up being a clunky mess that has some good aspects, but ultimately falls apart because things don&#039;t mesh well enough to create good synchronization.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Interesting world (Gotta give &#039;em for an interesting setting)<br />
-  Clunky pacing <br />
-  Jarring tone shifts<br />
-  Unclear antagonist motivation<br />
<br />
Characters: Inversely, the characters of Clockwork Planet share a different opinion when compared to its story.  Sadly, if you&#039;re not a main character, than the show really doesn&#039;t care about you.<br />
<br />
First are the duality of protagonists, Naota Miura, the boy whose sexual preference is robot and Marie Bell Breguet, the short fused clocksmith gone rogue.  Obsessed with clocks and wanting to be a clocksmith, Naota represents the &#039;Natural Genius&#039;, as his uncanny, natural ability to hear minute problems within the rhythm of gears and figure out the problem from that actually makes him quite interesting.  As a character, Naota is a boy who adores automata to the point that he makes one his waifu and gets very upset when they&#039;re mistreated.  Marie on the other hand is an experienced clocksmith representing the &#039;Learned Genius&#039; as comparatively, she knows how to fix stuff, but has to work to find the answer when her counterpart does the reverse.  Because of their contraries, the characters work well together as opposites, and the majority of the runtime is dedicated to their opposing ideas meshing together to fix the problem.  While they don&#039;t do well on their own, their teamwork brings up a good positive for the show since their bickering is actually really fun and interesting to watch.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s RyuZu, the one who follows.  As the main automaton of the series, RyuZu is a sharp-tongued robot gal who hates people but loves/respects Naota because he fixed what 200 years of clocksmiths couldn&#039;t repair.  Generally acting as a supplement to Naota&#039;s character, RyuZu acts as a bit of a gag due to how rude to everyone she is, thus creating some actually charming scenarios between the characters.  She mostly stays stagnant in terms of development like the rest of the cast, but the qualities involving her offensive nature make her very entertaining if nothing else.  Other automaton like AnchoR and Halter act a similar role in that they add more to the series to make the cast more colorful, but don&#039;t have much in the way of development and are really only necessary to the plot when needed.<br />
<br />
Aside from them, the supporting characters are shoddy examples of what not to do when creating a supporting cast.  The antagonists have very loose motivations that don&#039;t really make sense or amount to anything, and the supporting cast either have a very tiny role and/or don&#039;t really make much sense.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Interesting (and entertaining) main characters<br />
+ Entertaining supplementary characters to the main duo<br />
-  Supporting cast doesn&#039;t really matter all that much<br />
<br />
Art:  Produced by Xebec, Clockwork Planet&#039;s art leaves a lot to be desired.  The animation and art itself is standard fare, and the show uses actually really nice CGI in order to create the numerous amounts of gears, cogs, and machines that we see throughout the series.  Despite its background appearance, the character designs leave a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
While the original art for clockwork planet does leave some things to be desired, the anime&#039;s adaptation of said art has a lot of inconsistencies with it.  Character proportions (like AnchoR&#039;s head compared to her body) look off, as the heads of the characters are stretched length-wise and create some really peculiar looking people.  On top of that, the show&#039;s inconsistencies with character design make it so that one shot doesn&#039;t look the same as another, thus creating weird shots altogether.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Good use of CGI<br />
-  Inconsistent character designs<br />
<br />
Sound: Appropriately (or lazily) named &#039;Clockwork Planet&#039;, the show&#039;s OP made by Fripside is...quite samey to what the group makes.  A lot of their songs sound very similar, and this one is no different.  That isn&#039;t to say it&#039;s a bad thing, as the inclusion of windup noises and the overall tone of the song is still quite nice despite how similar it sounds to a multitude of their other tracks.<br />
<br />
The show&#039;s ED on the other hand (also appropriately named), &quot;Anti-clockwise&quot;, is a louder, slightly more screechy song with dissonant piano chords and an all around messier structure comparatively to its OP counterpart.  It&#039;s not that pleasant to listen to, and is one of those things that&#039;s worth skipping not because it&#039;s forgettable, but because it does grate on the ears a little bit.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+/- Tracks vary with your mileage<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment: I was anticipating the release of Clockwork Planet for quite a while.  It was one of those show that I really wanted to watch and I had to wait for its release because it was stuck in development hell for a little while.  Unfortunately, the end result I wouldn&#039;t say is worth the wait, but despite that, I still enjoyed it regardless of the fact that I can just as easily chalk up a lot of the shows problems and ultimately say that it is indeed a &#039;bad adaptation&#039;.  <br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this series?<br />
<br />
Critically, the show has many flaws.  Despite that, Clockwork Planet still managed to be a guilty pleasure of mine.  The bickering between the main cast really made the show enjoyable for me to the point that I really didn&#039;t care much for the story or any other aspect of the show.  Fripside&#039;s OP&#039;s always interest me, so I would be remised if I said that I didn&#039;t enjoy that too.  Sure it&#039;s not a great show, but a show doesn&#039;t have to be &#039;great&#039; in order for one to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
What didn&#039;t I like about this show?<br />
<br />
The last arc felt really weak.  Especially since it took about a third of the runtime, having a huge portion of the story stumble towards the end was a big letdown, especially since very few things at the moment clicked in place.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this series?<br />
<br />
If you just really want to see some interesting characters talk to each other, than Clockwork Planet fits the bill.  Again, the show struggles with having a cohesive story and the visuals leave some things to be desired.  Despite that, its characters make the show good enough for those with low standards to still find something enjoyable to watch, so if anything, I&#039;d say this show is for those willing to devote some time to enjoy something that&#039;s kinda stupid, if anything.

    I will note that I am not the best at writing reviews, and that this is only my second or third time writing one. It may not be objective and fair, but these are my honest thoughts on this anime.<br />
<br />
I decide to give this a fair try, and I&#039;ll be watching it till the end, my friend suggested it to me and that is why I am continuing to watch it otherwise I would have dropped it the first episode. He claims it picks up but I have yet to see that.<br />
<br />
The story is one of the weakest aspect of this show, careful because I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247544">
        might spoil a few things within the episodes I have already watched. The story goes as follow; random robot or android made of gears falls on some random kids home--the kid is noted to be unable to fix anything that has to do with gears, yet he can hear gears and is able to fix the android which hasn&#039;t been fixable in 200 years.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s just the first episode but no need to go further, over all it doesn&#039;t pick up and is unable to keep what tension there is by including poorly placed jokes to lighten things up.<br />
<br />
We move to the characters, the main character which I described in the second paragraph doesn&#039;t have any redeeming quality&#039;s other then liking gears and there is so much that could come from a series all about gears, but it doesn&#039;t seem like the gears are the main focus, just an after thought. Honestly the characters are non existent in their form in the anime, just generic personality you would expect. Naoto Miura is the happy go lucky one track mind pervert who loves his gears and won&#039;t do anything that doesn&#039;t involve gears. And Marie Bell Bregute is constantly looking to be the best that she can be and fix everything. There really is no personality here.<br />
<br />
Am I enjoying this series, no, I am watching because I&#039;m expecting it to get better but I am not seeing that. So in conclusion it&#039;s not a series I would suggest but others seem to enjoy it, and if you enjoy it, good for you, it&#039;s just something I would have dropped long ago if not for my friend. I gave it a 4 and if it does pick up I am open to changing that number but for now, it remains.

    Clockwork planet review <br />
<br />
Beautiful android girls saving the world from government corruption with the help of an eccentric ability user and a genius engineer. <br />
<br />
There are slight spoilers mainly in character analysis so please be aware as you read the review <br />
<br />
Based off the light novel of the same name Clockwork planet is an action based anime that has a pretty interesting premise in that it combines an action based anime with something that we usually see inside a sci fi anime which in this case are the automatons which is a type of advanced android that populate the world that this anime is set

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250805">
        in. Combine this with the unique setting that Clockwork planet is set in and you get clockwork planet. I always been a fan of sci fi and action anime but what I really like more is one that combines the excellent combat scenes that most action anime has with the futuristic settings that sci fi anime are renowned for. Clockwork planet combines the best elements of both into one and is one anime that’s been in my watch list ever since I saw the pv. <br />
<br />
Story and setting <br />
<br />
The story for clockwork planet takes place in the future where the planet after a series of destructive wars has left it barren and close to destruction has been transformed into a new planet that is composed entirely of gears by a renowned but mysterious clocksmith called Y. The setting for this story is centered on a futuristic version of japan which like the planet has undergone a radical change in its environments and in society.  <br />
The overall plot for the series is largely revolved around the theme for this series which is justice and the fighting of government corruption and follows the lives of a young teenage Boy called Nauto who possesses a unique talent that is seen by society as a threat and Mari a young teenage girl that also has a unique talent that allows her to excel in her duties as a meister which is an advanced engineer that is trained to repair the tech that is used in this futuristic world. Along the way they are assisted by Ryu zu and anchoR two advanced androids that were made in the early years of the transformation and are more advanced than any automaton that exists in the world. They are further assisted by a host of support characters that come from all walks in life. The overall plot of the series based off the concept of justice and pits Naoto, Mari and their allies against the corruption that has taken root in governments around Japan and can be described as a fight against social injustice. <br />
<br />
AnchoR<br />
<br />
AnchoR voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi of girlish number and unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Nauto and Mari’s main allies in the series. An advanced Y series android and a sister to Ryu anchoR resembles a young girl both in terms of in terms of physical appearance and in terms of personality. Personality wise anchoR is a cute, kind and innocent girl that behaves very much like someone of that age group. As a result of being ordered to guard a powerful weapon deep underground however in the beginning of the series anchoR was bound to a strict set of rules that mandated the actions that she can take as part of her duties. These unfortunately had the effect of causing her a great deal of trauma as her duties meant that any intruders that she detects will be terminated by her. As a result, at this point anchoR hid her true personality behind a wall wishing with all her heart for someone to hear her voice and save her. later on, and after she meets Nauto and Mari properly anchoR is finally awakened from her nightmare and her personality reverts back to her true self. As a result of waking up and seeing Mari and Nauto anchoR has the impression that Mari and Nauto are her parents and as a result see’s them as her mother and father respectively an aspect that I found to be cute and suitable for her character. Though somewhat slow to trust due to her past traumatic experience once anchoR’s has fully trusted someone she can be surprisingly loyal to that person. Though still bounded by the contracts that she forms with her master she can on occasion disobey an order if it means it will help her master. As a Y series, android anchoR like Ryu is also a capable combatant and in her case, can transform into a combat automata that takes the form of a red colored assassin that is lethal in close combat. Despite being smaller than Ryu anchoR is surprisingly capable in combat and her fight scenes with Ryu in the series was really impressive. <br />
<br />
As a character, I felt that anchoR was pretty well designed and fitted well with the theme of justice and corruption in that she was forced to carry out her duties of protecting something terrible that was located underground on the orders of corrupt adults despite the fact that she was nothing but a child. Seeing anchoR wake up from her nightmare that was forced on to her by her creators and awaken her true personality was a joy to see. It was nice to see her discover new things in life that she likes something that her past life can never do and in the process learning how to be more human. I felt that Sayaka Senbongi really did a great job voicing the character of anchoR. <br />

Marie <br />
<br />
Marie voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Denpa Kyoushi and Food wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Naoto’s main allies in the series. A teenage girl that despite her young age is actually a member of the meister order which in this universe are engineers that are tasked with keeping the complicated gears that power this new world in working condition. As the youngest person to be inducted into that prestigious order Marie is a genius level mechanic and has an innate understanding of how gears work and how they can be repaired. Marie is also a bit of a free spirit and isn’t scared of any pressure and indeed when sufficiently motivated won’t let enemies stand in the way of her repairs. Personality wise as a result of her former position as the head of a large tech company Marie is a feisty and confidant person that because of her skills can be arrogant at times and be dismissive of other people.  Marie’s most prominent trait is no doubt her determination which comes from her pride both as a meister and as someone that worked so hard to learn all the required skills that she has. As a result, even when confronted with a problem that is impossible to fix or modify Marie when sufficiently motivated can become really determined to finish that task and will not let anything that gets in her way. Despite her confident nature Marie can become depressed and go into despair especially when confronted with situations that seem to be impossible to decipher even for someone of her skills. This is however where her bond with Nauto comes into play however. <br />
<br />
Marie’s relationship with Nauto is an interesting one and one that forms part of the overall plot for this series. Though their initial meeting was anything but friendly and more along the lines of mutual antagonization over the series their relationship starts to improve as they both learn about each other and overcome challenges together. In the beginning of the series Marie’s relationship with Nauto was rather icy that stems from both her pride as a meister that caused her to look down at Nauto who she felt didn’t deserve such an ability. However, as the series goes on this relationship soon turns to one of respect as she become impressed by how useful and ground-breaking his ability is though this is far from the only reason as she also appreciated that fact that Nauto can always come up with a plan of action that while always sounding crazy never less has a good chance of working. By the end of the series it’s apparent that between Nauto and Marie is a relationship that is built on trust and respect for each other’s respective skills.  Another aspect of the relationship that is unique to Marie’s relationship with Nauto is way that Nauto supports Marie. Despite her positive and determined nature even Marie will sometimes find herself in the throes of despair and in this state Nauto is one of the few that can help Marie get out of that state. Just as Marie can appeal to Nauto’s skills at listening to gears in order to cheer him up Nauto when trying to cheer up Marie often makes use of jabs at Marie’s vaunted determination and pride that she has that usually has the effect of making her angry but at the same time open her eyes to new ideas that she is able to deduce thanks to her intelligence. <br />
<br />
The character of Marie I felt was pretty well designed and served as a great contrast to the other main characters of Nauto, Ryu and anchoR. Seeing two people of differing backgrounds be able to put aside their differences and develop a respect for each other and work together was a concept that I particularly liked. I felt that Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Marie. <br />
<br />
Vainney <br />
<br />
Halter Vainney voiced by veteran voice actor Kenichirou Matsuda is one of the main characters of the series and one of Marie and Nauto’s main allies in the series. A combat automaton that takes the form of a mid-aged man Halter serves as Marie’s bodyguard and main adviser in the series. A loyal, calm and stoic person Halter has a long past with Marie as he’s been serving her family and protecting her since she was a child. As a result, the bond that exists between the two is exceptionally strong. Although a bodyguard by definition should have as their main task be concerned with the protection of their charge Halter also serves as an adviser and confidant to Marie and often provides sound advice to her that is especially useful when she’s lost or does not know how to proceed with her plans. Because of their long association the relationship that Marie has with Halter is pretty close that is exemplified by the fact that Marie often plays pranks on him. Despite this Marie’s trust in Halter is very strong and Halter in turn is very determined to protect Marie as well. Though skilled in combat as expected of a bodyguard Halter is also rational enough to realize when a situation has turned against them and when the time to retreat is at hand. As a result, Halter can often make snap decisions that are contrary to Marie’s wishes but serve to protect her. <br />
The character of Halter I felt was an interesting contrast to Marie that was different to what Nauto brought to the table in that he serves to tamper Marie’s brash nature which by my count almost cost Marie her life quite a few times in the series. Halter’s dry wit and sound advice was also a welcome addition to the cast and often had the effect of keeping tension between Marie and Nauto down a notch as the series progresses. <br />
<br />
Naoto<br />
<br />
Naoto voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoshino Nanjo is one of the main characters of the series. A teenage boy and a high school student that in the beginning of the series lived in the Kyoto ward in Japan. A quiet but kind and caring person Nauto though not lacking in social skills can also be described as an otaku but not a normal one. In the case of Nauto the subject that Nauto is most interested in is in gears and machines and can as a result be described as a machine otaku. Though loving to fix and assemble machines in the beginning of the series Nauto had great trouble in fixing any. In the beginning of the series Nauto as a love for fixing machines actually aspires to become a clocksmith which would allow him to fix all kinds of machines that exist in this world of his. As a result, Nauto is somewhat jealous of those that have managed to attain that dream of his. Because of his kind and caring personality Nauto tries to treat everyone with respect and kindness but on some occasions, he can be overly brash sometimes. A prominent trait of Nauto’s personality that can be considered strange by people living in this world of his is that Nauto treats automatons with the same amount of respect and kindness that he treats regular humans with which often surprises the people that he meets along the way. Indeed, this was a surprise for even the automatons that he encounters along the way such as Ryu and anchoR. As one of the main characters of the series and one half of the Marie Nauto pair Nauto has an interesting ability in that as a result of having rather sensitive hearing Nauto is able to hear and locate any imperfections in a mechanical component and as such is able to help immensely in determining why a machine isn’t working as intended. <br />
<br />
As the series goes Nauto encounters a number of different characters that he’s able to establish friendships and bonds with the most significant ones being his relationship and bonds with RyuZu, anchoR and Marie. <br />
<br />
Nauto’s relationship with RyuZu serves as one of the main points of the series and I felt was a rather interesting one. In the beginning of the series Nauto encounters RyuZu in the most dramatic way possible and though the meeting was shocking to him was also what ultimately started his relationship with her. At first Nauto was a bit wary of Ryu as he had never seen an automaton that was as advanced as she was. But as a result of Nauto able to fix a problem within her that has compounded man men that were brighter than him Nauto was able to fix her and make her operational. Although In the beginning of the series Nauto was fascinated by Ryu as an automaton Nauto’s personality trait of treating automatons the same as he treats humans causes him to start to view Ryu as a human being as well and as the series progresses and they fight alongside one another countless times this causes develop a romantic interest in Ryu. Indeed, by the end of the series Nauto has indeed fallen in love with Ryu that culminates in a rather well put together scene where he presents a ring to her. However, Ryu zu is not the only special relationship that Nauto manages to establish as his relationship with anchoR was also another highlight of Nauto. An effect of Nauto’s relationship and close bonds that he forges with Ryu zu and anchoR is that he sees them as part of his family which has the effect of manifesting a sense of determination that causes Nauto to fight even harder to protect his family from harm. All in all, I felt that as a character Nauto was a pretty well-designed character whose main points was his kindness, honesty and his treatment of both automatons and humans equally and fairly that matched the theme of this anime pretty well. His relationship with Ryu zu was really sweet and their relationship was pretty well designed. I felt that Yoshino Nanjo actually did a great job in voicing the character of Nauto.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ryu zu <br />
<br />
Ryu Zu voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and the main heroine of the series. Ryu like anchoR is a member of the Y series an advanced series of androids that was created by the legendary clocksmith Y and despite being an old series is far more advanced than the automatons that replaced it in the world. RyuZu takes the form of a young teenage girl that can be best described as breathtakingly elegant as she really is beautiful. Personality wise Ryu zu adapts two different personas that she makes use of depending on the situation that she’s in. Her normal persona is one that is polite and respectful to all but usually quiet and focused. This is countered by her other persona that can be condescending to others but in a funny way that seems that she’s only making these comments and actions just for the fun of it. Unlike anchoR however Ryu has great pride in both herself and her specs as a member of the Y series and as a result tends to have a low opinion of humanity that despite all these years of having her in their possession have not managed to find a way to fix her. This opinion of humans however is done in a way that’s funny and contrasts with her normal composed and respectful persona. In the anime Ryu is noted to have an interesting personality trait in that she seems to prefer her actions to be dramatic in nature. Whether this is due to her wanting to display her superiority over current automatons and humans is something that we can only wonder. <br />
<br />
Ryu zu’s relationship with Nauto forms an important part of the series main plot and is a relationship that I thought was cute and well designed. Ryu Zu and Nauto met in a rather dramatic fashion early on the series and their relationship as a result started slow. In the beginning of the series Ryu was wary of Nauto but at the same time curious about him as he despite being a mere human could repair him. After seeing Nauto’s bravery and the way that he treats automatons as well as his attempts to protect those that are dear to him Ryu zu’s opinion of Nauto improved to the point where she requested that Nauto take up the mantle of being her master much to his surprise. As the series progresses and Ryu Zu gets to know Nauto more and understand his personality as well as his ability Ryu starts to gradually fall for Nauto much to the surprise of not just herself but Nauto as well. Despite being an android, this fact was surprising to me and at first, I thought it was simply because she was loyal to Nauto but this was not so as she likes him on her own free will and not out of a sense of loyalty to him. A unique trait of Ryu that only manifests when she’s dealing with her master or with Marie is that despite her beautiful appearance Ryu actually has a sharp tongue though while sounding hurtful also does a great job of keeping Nauto and Mari on track with their tasks in the series. Despite being an android Ryu can be surprisingly human at times when she’s with Nauto as he treats her more like a fellow human than an automaton which in the beginning baffled her. These actions which are an important part of his relationship with her was interesting as it showed that Ryu can also have human emotions that she shouldn’t have such as likes, dislikes, embarrassment and of course jealously. The teasing out of emotions from Ryu by Nauto I felt was a central part of their relationship in that it allowed both to have a better understanding of each other and in the course of it establish a much better relationship. Seeing Ryu exhibit a sense of jealousy when Naoto is admiring other machines was both an interesting and funny thing to see. <br />
<br />
All in all, I felt that the character of Ryu zu was a pretty well-designed character that showed that while automatons were created by humans they too can have their own free will and emotions and that their relationship with humans can be one of trust rather than one based on control. I felt that Ai Kakuma really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Ryu. <br />
<br />
Arts and animation<br />
<br />
In terms of art I felt that the character designs for the characters that were featured in this series was actually pretty good. The designs for the two Y series androids Ryu and anchoR I felt were pretty detailed and both despite looking really pretty and cute were also lethal in combat which I felt contrasted greatly with their looks. The clothing designs for Nauto and Marie I felt also did a good job in reflecting not just the time period but in the jobs that both did. The environmental design for the series is another thing that I liked and it was interesting seeing the future versions of Tokyo and Kyoto and see the subtle differences between the two. In terms of animation I felt that was pretty sharp and clear and each character whether they are main or support had a great deal of detail on them. The combat scenes for the series I felt were pretty good and were pretty well designed and executed with each fight being pretty unique. In particular the combat scenes that showed Ryu Zu and anchoR use their abilities in battle were pretty nicely detailed. The transformation scenes for both of the girls as well as the designs for their transformed self’s I felt was excellently done.    <br />
<br />
Music <br />
<br />
The music for the series in general were pretty good but I felt that the opening theme was perhaps the one that stood out the most. The ending theme though good felt somewhat flat when compared to the strong opening theme. The scene music for the series was generally good. <br />
<br />
Voice acting <br />
<br />
Voice acting in this series I felt was one of the series strong points and was consistently strong throughout the series. Of the characters that were featured in this show the main cast I felt had the best in terms of voice acting ability with the seiyuu’s for Ryu zu and Marie and Nauto who are Ai Kakuma, Saori Oonishi and Yoshino Nanjo respectively deserving particular praise for their performances as I felt that they did a great job in portraying their respective characters and bring them to live. Of the support cast the voice actors for the main villain in this series and the one that voices the gender bender cyborg soldier also deserves some praise for their performances. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
Overall, I felt that Clockwork planet was an interesting anime that among its strengths included an interesting premise, interesting characters, interesting story, strong voice acting and great combat scenes. This is however offset by the fact that the series did not really have what can be considered to be a strong villain role and indeed the one that can be considered to be that role only appeared much later in the series and as a result didn’t have time to make his presence felt. Despite that I do commend his effort in that although he had only a few episodes to establish himself he certainly did a good job in making himself a threat to not just the main cast but to the country as well. <br />
<br />
The premise of the show which emphasizes on justice and transparency as well as the beliefs in equality and trust between humans and automatons I felt was interesting and combined with the story was one of the main strengths of this show. In line with the theme of justice and transparency the main villains that are faced by the main characters were the government which while certainly serviceable as the villain could have been replaced by a better villain instead as their attempts to stop the cast while certainly over the top and destructive were more comical than dangerous. Despite this it was actually pretty satisfying in seeing the cast stop them and expose their crimes to the people though. On the other hand, the plans that the main cast hatch in their attempt to stop the government though was much better and far more creative in their plans than anything. Though the plans suggested as it is by Nauto always sound crazy and impossible seeing them actually work really tells you that unorthodox thinking can sometimes triumph over impossible odds especially if you have more brains than they do. <br />
<br />
 The characters for the show whether they were main or support ones I felt were all well designed and had a clearly defined role in the narrative. The struggles that they all experienced and the way that they actually overcome them was I felt pretty well done with my favourite here being anchoR’s as her past trauma was as such that it was the trickiest to solve and overcome. Watching the main cast start to learn to trust each other and respect each other as they try to stop the government’s plans was certainly entertaining and seeing them eventually put aside their differences and work together as a team to deal with the common threat was worth it. <br />
<br />
 The abilities that the two main characters have in this series I felt was pretty interesting and matched well with their personalities. With regards to character development for each of the characters I felt that they were done pretty well with each character becoming not just stronger but also improving upon their existing personalities. Although each of the characters are developed as the series progresses I feel that characters of Ryu and Nauto were developed more than the others especially with regards to Nauto’s bond with Ryu and her becoming more human as the series progresses. The romance between Nauto and Ryu while certainly strange I felt was interesting and also rather sweet because it felt natural as Ryu like a human fell in love because she saw Nauto’s true personality and came to admire it and the person behind it.  Though she may be icy on the surface beneath that is still someone that can still feel human emotion. In this I really liked seeing Ryu Zu act jealous when Nauto is with other girls as it shows how much has developed as a character. The combat scenes for the series Is another of the shows strong points and I felt that the combat scenes in this series was pretty well done. Seeing two Y series androids lay waste to an enemy force twice their number in a matter of seconds is immensely satisfying though that’s for sure. <br />

    This is a anime with a intriguing idea, and interesting premise and start, that doesn&#039;t really feel like it goes anywhere.   Which is a shame as there is so much to like about the world, I liked the idea of the earth essentially being a clock work planet now.<br />
<br />
Problem is this is a example of a great idea hindered by poor villains and lack of feeling of gravitas.   I never understood the villians goals, or their reasons and what their final plan was supposed to do.   which made the final moments confusing.<br />
<br />
I would say watch a few episodes to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250686">
        get the feel for the anime and the world, but if you watch more, be prepared to possibly feel unfullfilled.

    Warning possible Spoilers <br />
<br />
When I found out that Clockwork Planet was created by the same person who made No Game No Life I was definitely interested with what it would offer me, although despite not being as good as NGNL Clockwork Planet was still alright.<br />
<br />
When Earth was destroyed it was rebuilt by some God or being and made entirely out of Gears, Our MC Naoto Miura has a special gift that is needed by people to help fix certain gears, luckily he has a ragtag group to help him on his journey.<br />
The story of Clockwork Planet is pretty confusing and I&#039;ll admit it was hard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254978">
        to follow, but what I got from it is that gears are used for literally everything and that includes the cities people live in so if a gear goes wrong and can&#039;t be fixed then everyone is in big trouble so a group of special scientists are used to sort out these problems, but it runs much deeper than that as our group of characters discover which is more about the existence of the planet itself, It is a difficult story to take note of and even more difficult to make into words so I&#039;d watch the show if you want a detailed or better detailed explanation because the story though interesting isn&#039;t the best part of this show.<br />
Honestly the characters are the most interesting part of it mainly because each of them seem so different that they work very well together and it brings out a surprising amount of comedy for a show that I wasn&#039;t expecting to make me laugh a good number of times.<br />
However there is definitely one thing I understood from the story is that the word impossible is used a lot as a story development device because there are a lot of times where things go wrong for our hero&#039;s and they break down quite a lot of times because they think the situation they are trying to solve is impossible when really it isn&#039;t because they haven&#039;t used every option available, some people might think this is a stupid way to drive the plot forward, but honestly I think this just made the characters better because it showed how determined they are to save everyone even though some characters might not look like their trying to do that.<br />
<br />
The characters like I said before are the most interesting aspect of the show and it had a nicely mixed bunch who seemed very different to each other.<br />
Naoto is the male MC and he was very mixed for me as a character because he is someone that is fascinated with clockwork and wants to fix things yet he can never actually fix anything though he has a special hearing ability that allows him to locate any faults in the gears mechanism which really helps out the others a lot of the time, his character goes through some pretty weird stages as he starts out like a weird, but selfish asshole only caring for himself or the automatons, but after the halfway point he does start to become a better character as he starts thinking more about the people than himself.<br />
RyuZU is the female MC and is an Automaton that was made at the same time the planet was made making her a 1000 years old, she doesn&#039;t really show her emotions though she is very loyal to Naoto even to the point of threatening people when they are thinking of harming Naoto and there is one thing she definitely is and that&#039;s comedic gold because RyuZU will always make a pretty savage joke against anyone and not even realise it making her a good source of comedy in the show although despite being the female MC she really didn&#039;t do a whole lot other than kicking ass and being a savage she actually doesn&#039;t do a lot to solve a situation especially during the second half.<br />
Marie Bell Berguet to me is the true female MC of the show because she is pretty much Naoto&#039;s total opposite yet equal at the same time because she is incredibly good at fixing things and kicking ass too, you really notice the more you watch the show because both of them have something that the other needs making them a really interesting duo, Marie is actually a princess and can be a pretty stubborn girl yet very determined which is one of her strong points and even though she does take her anger out on Naoto and RyuZU it&#039;s actually understandable since they keep picking on her, but seeing her and Naoto&#039;s relationship develop was actually interesting and I thought she was actually a well rounded and useful character.<br />
AnchoR is another Automaton who is RyuZU&#039;s sister although she doesn&#039;t do a whole lot since she joined the group pretty late there was enough time to see she was a pretty adorable character though conflicted too since she didn&#039;t enjoy being a weapon and was glad that Naoto and Marie were able to give her free will with her decisions which in turn she references them as Father and Mother which seemed pretty odd at first, but made much more sense later, she has a very strong will and will even go as far as sacrificing herself just so she can bid time for Naoto and the others to complete their tasks.<br />
Halter Vainney is Marie&#039;s cybernetic bodyguard and a pretty funny one too, despite looking like a serious guy which he is Halter does like to make funny jokes with Marie from time to time even in combat though he does have a strong protective nature for Marie since he has been her bodyguard and close friend since she was a little girl so Marie is special to Halter and is willing to follow any order to make sure she&#039;s safe.<br />
<br />
The artstyle looked very interesting since clock gears aren&#039;t usually something that gets a lot of concentration so seeing an entire world made out of it looked architecturally amazing even if it is CGI and it looked even more amazing how almost everything is made out of it even the automatons who had a good looking technical interior, the characters design&#039;s themselves was interesting too, but the fact that both Naoto and Marie are 16 just doesn&#039;t match the way they look then again this is something that has happened plenty of times.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough there is actually a good amount of comedy in this anime which was something I wasn&#039;t expecting and it was actually pretty funny comedy with some moments making me laugh for a good bit like when Marie got that secret message that was a bit sexual and then RyuZU made a joke out of it which was really funny, most of the time it&#039;s usually RyuZU or Marie that make the funniest moments and they are mostly unexpected.<br />
<br />
With a good amount of comedy this show can be very serious as there are lots of times as I said before where the characters hit a wall and then have a big breakdown  until they get picked back up again and honestly I felt really bad for our hero&#039;s because they actually get screwed over probably every episode or almost every episode and it made me feel sorry that they had this many setbacks to deal with.<br />
There was also a decent amount of action although not the best and it was pretty short sometimes it was still entertaining especially when RyuZU or AnchoR went into their Imaginary forms which looked pretty cool and was definitely destructive.<br />
<br />
Overall this is probably the most interesting spring anime so far (well that isn&#039;t AoT S2) and I did like the chemistry between the characters so I&#039;d probably recommend this to anyone who is a fan of No Game No Life to see if they get the same interesting feeling.

    i was very surprised to see such low ratings! it feels weird to be reviewing a show that hasn&#039;t finished airing yet, but I felt something needed to be said so people don&#039;t turn away from this masterpiece based on the ratings and negative reviews. <br />
<br />
First of all, the art is incredible! This clockwork world is simply beautiful. The characters are interesting and creative. I love that the lead doesn&#039;t struggle with the kind of self esteem issues that drag on character development in many shows. I don&#039;t know about you, but I watch anime to see something more than ordinary. Anime has the power

          <span style="display: none;" id="review249478">
        to richly develop exotic worlds in vibrant color in ways that mediums simply can&#039;t do right now. (not cost effectively anyway!). Clockwork Planet is a world unlike our own.<br />
<br />
This show does force the watcher to accept that the physics of this world (this universe is obviously not ours), differs from our own. The way these gears work looks like magic to me, and thus, this show is closer to the magic genre than to mech. But they say that any technology, sufficiently advanced, would look like magic to undeveloped peoples. If you cannot accept that in this world gears have power in a way in ours it does not, I can see how you would find the show too unbelievable. If you can watch an anime and judge it based on the ideas within it and it&#039;s ability to help you imagine a new reality far different than your own, you too will see this as a masterpiece.

    One day, a little MyAnimeList user named FrozenRoy was on his friend&#039;s Crunchyroll account, looking for a show at the start of the anime season to watch, and eventually review on My Anime List. Our little FrozenRoy quite enjoys steampunk and clockpunk stuff and so was interested in a show called Clockwork Planet, because it had a really interesting premise. That&#039;s how we get here.<br />
<br />
Clockwork Planet&#039;s premise is, indeed, pretty cool: The planet Earth was fucked up so hard that it looked like humanity was going to become extinct, long ago. A supergenius only known by Y proposed and performed a massive operation to replace

          <span style="display: none;" id="review254275">
        the planet, piece by piece in its entirity, with a world made out of clockwork, gears floating in space. And he managed to do it. A thousand years later, we live in a world of gears where clockwork machinery is an every day part of life, and main character Naoto Miura discovers RyuZU (yes, the caps are meant that way), a clockwork automaton made by Y.<br />
<br />
This is a fairly solid start, right? We&#039;ve got potential mystery of the past and present, if you like cute girls its got a robot, the other main character Marie is also presented as facing a crisis with one of the city&#039;s main gear towers, giving us some instant suspense. So, sounds like a good start for a series, right? How does it shape up?<br />
<br />
Haha, it is TERRIBLE. First off, the plot and backstory is all but irrelevent. Very little of the show couldn&#039;t have just been set in a somewhat future world and been almost the same. Marie&#039;s plot with the military is one of the most obvious and yet blundered plots I&#039;ve seen in a while: The &quot;villain&quot; is utterly incompetent both in terms of in character and how they are provided, for example, and the logic of it is quite absurd, I&#039;m trying not to spoil it but...look, its like if you tried to cover up killing someone by going out and bombing a police station. Yeah, great, people might not investigate that murder, now you&#039;re on the hook for something more! They later do try to do a single thing with the Y backstory, but its so poorly communicated that it ends up as very muddy and simply doesn&#039;t go anywhere, creating a villain with essentially zero motivation.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s another thing about this series that sucks. There&#039;s a few villains who are even named and all of them have either cardboard cutout or non-existant motivations, never get to fight and do not perform logical plot functions. Instead, 90% of enemies are nameless mooks who are supposed to be good fighters, but get mowed down by the dozens until they are little more than speed bumps on the path of the heroes. When the game makes it out like they are actually a threat, it doesn&#039;t feel tense or believable, because we&#039;ve seen these exact enemies get simply flattened previously, eliminating the suspension of disbelief.<br />
<br />
Characters in this series tend to end up with boring or inconsistant characterization. Naota has any potentially interesting gimmick in how much he is just a huge gear fan in this world, buuuut that mostly goes nowhere and he ends up being the generic main character surrounded by waifus. RyuZU has is oveprotective but it seems very selective when she is and otherwise is kind of just...there, it is hard to say she has a very defined personality, although that to an extent has a point due to her robotic origins. She does have one good quality, especially in a show full of not very likable characters: She&#039;s programmed to phrase her compliments in the most biting manner, resulting in her cutting down character&#039;s for their deserved stupidity repeatedly. <br />
<br />
I hold a particular dislike in my heart for Marie, though, whose character was terrible and incoherent throughout the entire piece. The show really doesn&#039;t know how to portray her. Sometimes she comes across as incredibly hot headed and arrogant, other times she is over the top depressed about her abilities. Most commonly, she seems to take whatever extreme that Naota isn&#039;t taking, in order for him to take the reasonable viewpoint and come out on top of her, which also makes stuff of the finale seem rather out of place in the series. Her super speed repairing powers seem quite random and are generally poorly animated, she generally was very badly done as a character, including a worse &quot;hidden identity&quot; than Clark Kent, which also ends up being thrown out in like 3 episodes anyway so WHAT WAS THE POINT. TELL ME YOUR SECRETS, SHOW.<br />
<br />
You also get Halter, who is...generic bodyguard basically. AnchoR I can&#039;t talk much about for some spoiler purposes, but she too is quite bad, and in particular has some icky stuff where the show really doesn&#039;t seem to want to know if it wants to take a romantic rival or daughter situation with her. The results are as squicky as you might imagine.<br />
<br />
AnchoR is a good anchoring, hehe, point to talk about the shows AWFUL art and sound design and direction. The art is the far worse of the two: AnchoR&#039;s hair frequently looks like toothpaste on top of her head and character&#039;s outfits are frequenrly drawn in an odd and improper manner, making it look almost more like a paper doll with clothing that is a part of them and shifts awkwardly. Expressions do not always properly follow moods, often if animation is repeateded, such as Marie looking confidently annoyed at Naota in a scene where she is clearly in great distress. Animation of characters often is flimsy during talking or still shots, making characters look uncomfortable and blob-like, with machinery having uninspired designs and backgrounds being sparsely detailed. AnchoR frequently gets it the worst due to her dress and hair, making her stand out as being unrealistically poor in the crowd.<br />
<br />
Sound design is similiarly poor, with uninspired voice acting with the exception of Halter who has a kinda cool older guy edge to him, entirely forgettable and drab in-story soundtracking and lacking sound effects for various things, although it often more skirts to forgettable than horrible in comparison to the art. I gave it a 2 simply because the OP is decent enough, especially with the clock effects in the background, and because of a handful of good mechanical noises in the finale, putting it above the true dredges of the world in that regard. <br />
<br />
So, ultimately, the thought of this show should be rather obvious: It is dreadful. The plot is poorly paced, with filler slapped in at random and utterly drama breaking comedic moments hampering a script full of obvious stupidity and little tension. The art is some of the worst I&#039;ve seen in a while, unless you are a huge fan of Colgate making some hot new anime. The sound design is poor and uninspired and the characters have difficult defining their personalities or otherwise are extremely inconsistant and poorly done. Battles are extremely disappointing, with action scenes largely consisting of stomps or boring fights against mooks, with no true villain fights even, eating up runtime as little more than filler. If you consider yourself a connoisseur of bad anime, then give Clockwork Planet a look, as it has plenty of material to mock with your friends. But if you want a quality anime, avoid Clockwork Planet in its entirity: You miss nothing but terrible spins on pre-existing concepts and an infuriating inability to do anything with its core concept.

    This anime, for the lack of a better word, is definitely a disappointment thus far. Everything about it has been lacklustre in my opinion and I have to say, I&#039;ve been watching this anime ever since it&#039;s been released in hopes but I&#039;m still unsatisfied even up to episode 8 - they still jump around the plot, drag things on and cut out important bits.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a kind of anime that you HAVE to watch before reading the light novel or manga, or better yet, just don&#039;t watch this and read the manga/LN. <br />
<br />
If I hadn&#039;t read the manga or the LN, then perhaps I would&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248651">
        rated this whole show a solid 4-5. <br />
<br />
All I can say is that I&#039;m just left really disliking this anime, after all, I have been waiting for this anime to be released since I quite liked the manga. <br />
<br />
Story: 4 <br />
The story&#039;s decent. It definitely has some interesting premises such as a world made of gears, this mysterious god-like person called &#039;Y&#039;, the meaning behind the Initial-Y series, and I&#039;m honestly curious as to where Naoto&#039;s parents are – which, really, aren’t new brought to the table. Honestly, that&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s interesting me. <br />
<br />
However, the story is not set out quite well (I have to admit it&#039;s the same in the LN or the manga) with the animators either rushing or dragging the whole plot and cutting out some important bits from the original sources that sometimes I feel like the story is going nowhere. And to be fair, it is an anime so it requires more effort but still; I think they could handle the story a little better. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the story&#039;s quite predictable turning what could’ve been something interesting as just… something ordinary and decent. There’s some good humour but too much fanservice that honestly doesn’t add to the plot.<br />
<br />
Compared to the first few episodes though, it became marginally better by episode 8, a solid 4.5/10. Not much improvement but eh.<br />
 <br />
Art: 4<br />
Now the art - I expected so much of the art since I really like Kuro’s and Shino’s art, and not to mention the promotional poster by Shino makes it look amazing, but the art is… average. Honestly, I really, really don’t like how Naoto’s been drawn and sometimes, the anatomy of the characters turn very strange like their eyes are too far apart or inhuman actions. <br />
<br />
But, like I said; the art’s average, good but not spectacular. Not all of them look the same and they draw action scenes quite well (I suppose) and I really like the drawing of the buildings, the gears, the weapon animations and fighting sequences and the world. The lighting effects are quite… exaggerated but you can see that the animators are quite talented.<br />
<br />
I was also rather confused by the opening with the roses and them dramatic poses. <br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
I guess the sound is better. I like the songs, they’re fairly good for the soundtrack across the episodes, though I kind of don’t pay much attention to them since I get mildly distracted from the interactions of the characters, it’s fitting to the mood of each scene it plays at – it’s an aspect that I appreciate in this anime. <br />
<br />
I really like the fight scene music, too, since they make them sound cooler and the sound effects are very, very fitting.<br />
<br />
Of course, as a Soraru and Mafumafu fan, the ending song is AMAZING. I love their voices so much and the beat is just, woah. Seriously, the instrumentals along with their vocals are so pleasant to the ears! It’s an ending that I always stay to listen to. <br />
<br />
The cast was also alright though I find Naoto&#039;s voice a bit annoying, but still quite good voice acting.<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
To be blunt, the characters sucks in this anime. They are all so bland and just… typical…<br />
<br />
So, worst character first, must be Naoto. The genius guy who doesn’t seem like a genius, doesn’t even know it and ends up being too rash and always making stupid choices. Not to mention he is absolutely loud and obsessive, AND perverted. His character design is okay and would’ve been better if he was more to the quite side. His only redeeming feature is he’s not the kind to give up, but even then, that feature annoys me. Honestly, I find his character irritating and I really don’t find his relationship to RyuZu all that appealing – it seemed more like nerd-guy-who-can’t-get-a-girl-actually-gets-a-beautiful-girl trope and frankly, the fanservice only served to make me hate Naoto even more – and mostly in this anime. <br />
<br />
Second worst character – which a LOT of people will hate me for – is RyuZU in my opinion. She’s the typical goudere, one who wants to please her lover and speaks harshly because people apparently find them appealing – not really. Her character irks me when she frankly puts Marie as her target of insults and the like, and her relationship with Naoto is just too much fanservice for me. <br />
<br />
Marie has to be the better character compared to these two despite being the whiny brat character – she’s more real, and more to the we-need-to-plan-first person, kind of like a foil to Naoto – in a way, she’s more human than Naoto. While Naoto is irritating in the way that I can’t care for him because he doesn’t care about the millions of people dying over his waifu who can be fixed unlike humans, Marie cares and she’s self-conscious about herself to the point she wants to be the best and actually concerns more about the people rather than some automaton waifu, though she is still quite unlikeable since she’s the typical tsundere princess genius trope. <br />
<br />
Halter and AnchoR are best characters just because they aren’t as annoying as Naoto and Halter reminds me of a Dad and AnchoR is just so cute.  <br />
<br />
I also feel like they missed a lot of characterisation that was included in the manga/light novel. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4<br />
If I hadn’t read the LN or the manga, I would have given this show a good 5/10 for enjoyment, because while I rather watched only to be disappointed, it is rather enjoyable and quite laid-back. The sound is pleasant to the ears, the animation is rather nice to look at if you can get past the annoying characters and there are some characters that you can enjoy.<br />
 <br />
Overall: 3 <br />
It’s a good 3/10 because the recent episode is fairly okay. It just cuts out too much important information but drags on unneeded ones, the characters are just annoying and very dull as a show with a rather interesting premise.<br />
<br />
If you want to enjoy this anime, I highly recommend that you watch this either without reading the LN or manga, read it after or just don’t watch it and read the manga (the manga has fewer fanservice scenes than both LN or anime).<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll see if the future episodes will change any of my scores in the future *crosses fingers, hoping it would*

    This anime is a bit special to me; it was written by the author of No Game No Life, one of my favorite lightnovels, Yuu Kamiya-sensei. <br />
<br />
First off, I would like to say that the benchmarks for a 10 are:<br />
<br />
Story: Steins;Gate, Iron-Blooded Orphans<br />
Art: 5 cm per second, Violet Evergarden<br />
Sound: Guilty Crown, Spice and Wolf<br />
Character: Kimi no na Wa, Koe no Katachi<br />
Enjoyment: Lucky Star, Ghost in the Shell<br />
Overall: Working!!<br />
<br />
It is the story of a genius boy (Naoto) that can hear every detail inside a world made entirely out of clockwork by a man named Y 1000 years ago: Clockwork Planet. His skill is certainly useful in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269069">
        this world where everything is made out of gears since he can spot problems really quickly.<br />
<br />
One day, a girl automaton - human-looking androids that are wholly made of gears - falls from the sky. She has one gear malfunction, which Naoto quickly repairs. She is revealed to be RyuZU, over 1000 years old, and was built by Y himself. Thus starts the story of a genius boy and his legendary automaton, along with another genius girl, Marie Breguet, youngest Meister in history, and her butler.<br />
<br />
As you can see, there&#039;s lots of geniuses in this story, which is a trademark of Kamiya&#039;s work. If you read the light novel, you also know that the playful tone gently complements the dense details very well. The story is paced a bit weird, but paced enjoyably, so it gets very good; it doesn&#039;t matter what technique they used as long as the consumer enjoys.<br />
<br />
This anime makes quite a good use of the medium; it is stunning to see a world entirely made out of clockwork. The style is also what I expected: I really liked Naoto and AnchoR&#039;s designs. However, I would have liked to see a bit more details and shadows here and there. It feels like the budget was lacking a little, after spending it all on animating the countess gears. The endings and openings are much better animated than the anime. If the whole anime was animated like that, I would comfortably give a ten. Therefore, I also notched it down to a 9, because the quality was inconsistent. Although the gears are absolutely stunning and beautiful, some scenes are literally a character standing there while the background pans from left to right. I believe Kamiya-sensei&#039;s work deserves more budget than this.<br />
<br />
As for the sound, I find it quite pleasant to listen to. The OP and ED aren&#039;t particularly good, but neither are they particularly bad. They sound quite generic, but the animation is something absolutely amazing to watch. The music paced well with the actions of the characters, and it flowed melodiously and didn&#039;t feel weird. It deserves an 8 because it isn&#039;t particularly touching either.<br />
<br />
The characters are getting a solid 9, almost touching 10. Naoto&#039;s baby-like idiot behavior is something that not many anime exploit, and RyuZU&#039;s arrogant but loving servant attitude is pretty unique too. Breguet and AnchoR are both quite memorable; you won&#039;t mistake them for anyone else in the &quot;Waifu or Laifu&quot; game. There is quite a good character development, but still somehow lacking compared to most romantic, character-centered animes. It still gets 9 because this anime is more story and action-centered, and we have to compensate for that too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment gets full marks: any anime that&#039;s interesting enough to make me stay up the whole night watching (me, who isn&#039;t a binge watcher and got tests coming) are deserving of full marks. The fanservice isn&#039;t appreciated by me (not a fan) but I didn&#039;t feel particularly uncomfortable rewatching it at school. Some moments even made me laugh. The rewatch rating is also very high; would rewatch anytime. Enjoyment is up there with Rewrite, Working!! and Lucky Star.<br />
<br />
Overall, it gets a 9. It would have been a 10 if only the art was a bit better. It&#039;s a really thin line, but it&#039;s probably in the 9.5 range, since I did see the amazing OP and ED, meaning the studio did have the skill to animate this properly.<br />
<br />
Reccomend: Chobits, for an enjoyable trip to a cozy home in future Japan

    This anime sucks. Earth is destroyed and a genius name Y recreate it with gears, the story may look like interesting but trust me, it&#039;s not. The first few episodes looks pretty interesting but i don&#039;t understand why they put fan service stuff in this anime. Well it&#039;s not like hardcore but it&#039;s very lame. You don&#039;t even laugh for the jokes, it&#039;s that bad. The story gets worst every new episodes come&#039;s out. I have dropped this anime at episode 8. <br />
<br />
Story - Horrible story, suddenly a female powerful robot falls from the sky and he considers it has his wife and after few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248553">
        episode they fight his female robot sister and win and calls it has his daughter. To accompany this three, there is one more small girl and she has one more man has a body guard. He will be pretty much hugging this female character and other will be like, have u abandoned me !!! With all this they fight bad people.... If you are into this kind of stuff, go for it. To people who wants enjoy, learn, laugh please stop reading this review and go search for an other anime because trust me, it&#039;s not worth watching.

    Story:<br />
This is the anime&#039;s weakest point. It starts off okay, but the events that go on don&#039;t generally have a particularly good connection to each other and it&#039;s very predictable. There is literally no reason to anticipate that any major character will actually die or is in any danger and it&#039;s really just a show where the major characters blow stuff up and keep succeeding. There is very little world building as well despite the potential that this show has to make that interesting.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
One of the slightly better parts of the story. There is some growth in Marie Bell Briguette and there&#039;s some development with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250775">
        AnchoR. But other than these two the rest are kind of one dimensional. Marie also surprisingly looked a lot better in her disguise than her usual outfit, so it kind of begs the question why that isn&#039;t her usual design.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
It&#039;s one of the more distinct art styles in this day and age, albeit childish-looking. The backgrounds are nice, but the characters could have used a more sophisticated design.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
It has a nice-ish opening song. In general though, nothing special.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Not displeasing like some worse written anime out there. Just not great.<br />
<br />
Who&#039;s this for?<br />
-Kids<br />
-People who want a simple and straight forward plot<br />
-People who just want mindless action<br />
-People who have a thing for lolis (AnchoR and Marie)<br />
<br />
Who&#039;s this not for?<br />
-People who want a sophisticated plot<br />
-People who want all the main characters to be decently 3 dimensional<br />
-People who enjoy more sophisticated art/character designs.<br />
-People who want there to be good world building

    It&#039;s not a good sign when the most compelling scene of a new anime series occurs before the opening credits in the first episode. Clockwork Planet was pretty much all downhill from there. <br />
<br />
I recall noticing a comment on some website or other noting that this was the ultimate chuunibyou show, and I&#039;d say that&#039;s about right. Clockwork Planet plays out as an endless variation on weird anime-centric fetishes instead of something resembling a real story. I was initially attracted to the show because I thought it might involve some kind of steampunk aesthetic, but I was quickly disabused of that potentiality. Instead, you have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250727">
        a ludicrous notion that the entirety of planet Earth was reconstructed with gears, cogs, and endless other mechanisms. Evidently this world also includes artificial intelligences that are also made entirely of clockwork parts. <br />
<br />
Now, this is not necessarily a bad premise for a series, but Clockwork Planet makes absolutely no effort to explain, justify, or even marginally expand on this initial concept. Instead, you get a lot of incredibly dull bickering between the two protagonists, and even more ridiculous interactions between them and a few clockwork-based humanoid creatures. It&#039;s barely worth expanding on this aspect of the show, but the male protagonist spends a ton of screen-time obsessing over two female clockwork entities to the point that it really becomes creepy. Obviously this is the intent, and it&#039;s acknowledged quite a few times during the 12-episode run. But why? Who cares? Not me, at any rate.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t care because, for all of its action scenes and supposedly intense narrative drive, Clockwork Planet had nowhere to go. The characters don&#039;t really develop, and really it&#039;s pretty generous to even call them characters at all. You&#039;re essentially given a set of archetypes and asked to care about their actions and choices when (a) they&#039;re really just constructs serving as mechanisms to advance the plot, and (b) they never really develop in any noticeable way. If the overall plot had been at all interesting, then I think it would be possible to forgive some lack of decent characterization, but I couldn&#039;t be bothered to care about that aspect of the show either. As far as I could tell, things happened, characters popped up when necessary to advance the rather meaningless story, and then it all ended. That&#039;s it. <br />
<br />
I was incredibly disappointed by this show and I would not recommend it to anyone. It&#039;s not vile, but it&#039;s pointless. I know that the goal was to create some really cool show with &quot;meaningful&quot; plot developments and genuine emotional depth, but I cannot possibly imagine how the mess that is Clockwork Planet could ever attain even the level of an average but uninspiring series. In a way, perhaps that&#039;s appropriate. Clockwork Planet, in a sense, lived up to its name. The show runs like an odd little machine ticking away, without a point or purpose. By the time its mechanism ran down at the end of episode 12, could anyone really have been bothered to wind it up again? I certainly could not be bothered.

    Now this is important: You should never just take someone else&#039;s opinion as the end all be all.<br />
<br />
ILL KEEP IT SHORT FOR YOU:<br />
This anime is a masterpiece in its own right. The only way i see it getting so many bad reviews is that all the people that actually bother to write these things are closed minded idiots that cant embrace the different perspectives that some anime series try to recreate like this one.<br />
<br />
Clockwork planet&#039;s plot is by all means short and very open to a second season if they can bring back the same or improved interest (hooks) as the first season.<br />
<br />
With its stupid

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261811">
        comedy sections thrown into random scenarios the series keeps you focused on not just the action packed fights but also at what the characters are saying.<br />
<br />
If we look into the characters a bit, we will notice that they are plainly common personalities, seen time and time again in lots of anime, manga and light novel series. But when we tae this into account along with the random idea of a world like a clock, you will realise that it makes sense to keep the simplicities in the series or it becomes too difficult for people to connect and enjoy the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now there are a few issues with the plot of this series, like how the problem each time ends up being too similar and the solution is almost always the same as well. Also there&#039;s the cliché that the main characters just happen to be the only people capable of fixing the problem even though the world of clockwork planet s one with many abnormalities, or you could say, dark places with who knows what lurking. <br />
<br />
<br />
So overall I personally think this series is possibly up there with one of the greatest in the last decade, and I would bet that lots of you will have similar but not so extreme opinions on this series.<br />

    Alright this is my first review but cut me some slack<br />
<br />
I watched up to the 6th episode and i gotta say this anime is crap. The characters are too 1-dimensional, the tensions is fleeting and the first villain doesn&#039;t even provide any form of pressure.<br />
take an example from the first scene we see this &quot;villain&quot;, at first he&#039;s all chill and stuff saying things like &quot;I can&#039;t let you do that, it&#039;s against the &quot;insert powerful association&quot; orders&quot; and doesn&#039;t let tsundere girl go save people. But the moment she pulls a gun on him out of anger, he suddenly squeals in fright completely ruining

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247683">
        the moment. <br />
Not to mention it&#039;s really rushed. (apparently the first 4 episodes went through 2 volumes)<br />
<br />
It was really hyped up because it was created by the same person who wrote NGNL but honestly it doesn&#039;t live up to it&#039;s glamor.

    Now, I&#039;m not going to say this was a masterpiece, but after watching 11 episodes (soon to be 12 later today when it comes out on CRoll) I can tell you that this anime was a fun ride. When it first came out, I was hesitant because I wasn&#039;t sure how well they would adapt the novel. It really does a good job at squeezing out the more entertaining parts from the 3 novels it has covered into a 12 episode series. Personally, I believe that it is one of the best new anime this season. I would suggest it, but I have to warn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250644">
        you, the first episode really made me and quite a few other fans nervous, as a couple scenes really didn&#039;t make the anime look promising. I would say after the first episode, it has a been a very smooth ride.

    STORY: Story begins when Naoto saves a cyborg named RyuZu by activating her. RyuZu pays him back by calling him master and ordering his commands. Soon, they team up with a girl named Marie and her bodyguard Halter. The enemy = the government. They have committed purges on the cities which causes the destruction &amp; deaths of the citizens. The story also talks about the origins of how Earth was re-created over 1000 years ago with gears by Y. He is also the creator of RyuZu. CONTAINS: A lot of backstories and conspiracies, Action-fighting scenes, Humor, romantic-comedy moments (including Loli) &amp; weird sexual encounters.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
Naoto: High

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250751">
        school student who has a gift of repairing robots and automaton with sound. Has a fetish for beautiful automatons. Caring, but perverted too.<br />
RyuZu: Strongest weapon created by Y. Owes her life to Naoto for saving her. Her outfit reminds me of a nun. She is brutally honest and can come off as a savage (with her words and fighting skills).<br />
Marie: Gifted young Engineer. Has a Doctorates Degree. Strong on the outside, but during tough situations... she is very vulnerable. Plus, she has a sweet tooth and uses desserts as her source of energy.<br />
Halter: Marie&#039;s bodyguard, former soldier, has cybernetic parts. He keeps Marie in line whenever she gets out of control.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Alright, but I really enjoyed the battle scenes in the anime. It&#039;s really cool to see how gears work and integrated in their everyday lives. BUT, I would really like to know what was the cause of Earth&#039;s destruction prior to Y reviving it!

    TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.<br />
<br />
Oh, Clockwork Planet... How I had such high hopes for you, and in a way, you didn&#039;t let me down at all.<br />
<br />
Clockwork Planet revolves around a world made out of... gears and clockwork parts. Go figure. The earth&#039;s resources had been used up to it&#039;s fullest, so a mysterious man known as Y made the Clockwork Planet by himself. Fast forward a hundred years or so, and we have Naoto Miura, an aspiring clocksmith. Someday, a female automaton falls through his roof, and discovers that she&#039;s not functioning properly.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review251601">
        He then uses his insanely OP talent of being able to hear how the gears move and see their locations to fix RyuZU. She ends up making Naoto her master as they move on to greater and bigger things.<br />
<br />
The problem with this show is that it&#039;s insanely cheesy and so poorly done that I honestly believe Xebec was trying to make a joke of this show, in and of itself. The goofy animation, lines, and ideals spouted from Naoto made this a great show for just turning off your mind and watching on autopilot. Marie, on the other hand, is just about as annoying as you can get. With her constant &quot;I am regarded as a genius, yet I can&#039;t do anything!&quot; bullshit will frustrate just about anyone and everyone that watches this show. All the other characters are absolutely not important and are just there to wreck havoc upon the world at large. I&#039;d just like to mention as well, Naoto should&#039;ve been a female character.<br />
<br />
The art and sound direction are less than mediocre. As formerly mentioned, the art/animation is just really lackluster, and the same goes for the sound. There was several really odd scenes with the animation (see last episode with the hand clap of Marie and her friend) that just felt so out of place.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Clockwork Planet is only enjoyable if you&#039;re able to turn off your brain and just watch for the awfulness. If you&#039;re a super serious person who watches for amazing action scenes, insanely moving dialogue, or exponential character growth, this is not the place for you. Only watch this show if you&#039;re okay with having a good time watching something really, really underwhelming.

    You know what type of anime is the absolute worst to review? The one where you can&#039;t even voice a detailed opinion about it without a horribly massive spoiler, which I won&#039;t reveal. I was incredibly close to dropping this whole thing every moment from episode 1 to 10 but stuck with it almost entirely thanks to the beautiful artwork, even though 9 of 10 contraptions are just dumb redundant clusters of gears spinning in place without the slightest credibility to their function.<br />
<br />
I flat out hated the main guy until the spoiler, then I only disliked him intensely. I thought everything was absolute moronic garbage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261126">
        beyond compare until the spoiler, then I only thought it was really dumb and poorly planned. Had I stopped and dropped before the spoiler I&#039;d have scored this anime among the worst I&#039;d ever had the misfortune of watching, now I only think it was a waste of patience.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t reveal what happens down the road, if you can endure hours of nothing but a giant middle finger raised against everything you know about physics and mechanics you deserve all the reward you can get. As usual with these logically flawed animes you&#039;re more likely to have a good time the more ignorant and unintelligent you are, this also applies to a reduced-but-still-huge degree after the &quot;conclusion&quot;. Since I have a very good understanding of physics, mechanics, basic neurology and general human biology the only things that pulled the score up were fine art and good enough sound.

    This is my opinion, If you get triggered while reading this because you don&#039;t like the anime don&#039;t read it.<br />
<br />
Personally I thought it was a very good anime. Even though I have not written many reviews before.<br />
I think this anime is very good even though It doesn&#039;t have so many episodes. The audio in the anime was pretty good.<br />
<br />
It actually had a decent storyline but I felt like it had much more potential. The character designs were very unique and had an outstanding design. Overall it is a very good anime.<br />
<br />
And I would highly recommend it for viewers.

    Clockwork Planet for LA is easily summed up in 6 words &quot;could have been sooo much better&quot;.<br />
<br />
Clockwork Planet from the genius mind of Yuu Kamiya of No Game No Life fame is about Naoto Miura voiced by Yoshino Nanjo who is obsessed with automata&#039;s and has an eerie ability to hear what&#039;s wrong with automations and when a black box containing a female automata by the name of RyuZU literally falls into his lap, his world of success and failures of a gear-like world will come under attack.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sounds interesting right?.....yeah too bad it utterly fails in it&#039;s execution though.<br />
<br />
What does LA mean by this?,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250834">
        well LA will be referring to Yuu Kamiya&#039;s other work No Game No Life for this a couple times in this review but for the main protagonist Naoto, he&#039;s essentially Sora without the sense of urgency at the matter of the world collapsing at hand and is your all mighty janitor, Marie Bell Breguet voiced by Saori Oonishi is the other main protagonist of the this anime and is the one wanting to find RyuZU as it was initially hers in the first place. She is essentially your Shiro but with less tact. These two characters are essentially the win all button as they in the most slimmest of margins will win any battle they come across. Now your thinking that Sora and Shiro did the same thing what&#039;s the difference between them and Naoto and Marie?...Sora and Shiro&#039;s talents and tactics were shown to us making their journey in their Game World be investing to the audience and slight plot twists were hinted at us before finally showing to us in full force making them badass in the process allowing their journey through their games to have context and inviting to watch, Naoto and Marie&#039;s on the other hand...don&#039;t give us the context it needs and denies the sense of urgency in their plans (heck Naoto NEVER gives us even a hint that he had something in mind before showing it) and arcs just end and start up again with new villains really wanting the same thing....to destroy their world.<br />
<br />
Do you know what&#039;s worse?...the animation done by Xebec only makes what was supposed to be amazing and gorgeous looking to look bland and boring and it&#039;s character design for this anime done by Shino of Lance N&#039;Masques and less said about Lance N&#039;Masques the better only made it sooo much worse. The poor and bland animation permeates this anime all the way through from it&#039;s CGI gears abundant, janky character designs and movements and battles that does get better by the final arc (if only to make it look polished but not much else). The ONLY exception to this becomes RyuZU and AnchoR but even then it&#039;s characters designs were soo much better in it&#039;s manga state than what the anime gave us.<br />
<br />
LA really wanted to like this anime but ever so quickly LA just found it boring or just saw perplexing story decisions especially at the end of arcs it went through and let&#039;s not even get started on the blatantly awkward fanservice moments...like Marie&#039;s naked body in the shower during a depressing time to AnchoR calling Naoto cute when she also sees him as a father to just fanserviced costume for Marie and AnchoR easily makes the fanservice awkward most of the time and again...the animation doesn&#039;t helps it&#039;s case either.<br />
<br />
There is a good anime within the crap decisions and utterly baffling execution of most of it&#039;s plot and let&#039;s just say that even the ending left it in a dour note as it just left it as &quot;another arc done...next&quot; kind of scthick and characters just not caring they took down a villain who&#039;s presences even confused LA as to why he was doing or was even here.<br />
<br />
LA will say that at the very least the voice acting was decent overall with Saori Oonishi giving her all in this trainwreck, LA did kinda wished that Yoshino Nanjo as Naoto could just dial it down a bit and LA really did like Ai Kakuma as RyuZU and Sayaka Senbongi as AnchoR but nonetheless from the entire voice cast was decent albeit some annoyances.<br />
<br />
Clockwork Planet is an anime with no urgency, giving the audience nothing in return for us watching it and has god-tier protagonist who can fix anything thus even it&#039;s tension is gone, baffling and confusing plot decisions and even worse animation looking either ugly or janky. If Clockwork Planet was given to someone who knew what they were doing and changed some things to make more sense and was given to Madhouse or Kyoto Animation, then this anime would not be this forgettable but unfortunately in LA&#039;s circumstances...that&#039;s exactly what Clockwork Planet has turned into.
