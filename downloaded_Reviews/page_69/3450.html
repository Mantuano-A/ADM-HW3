    So this is a show about a cute daughter and her growing up. Not really a complicated setting to follow, so what could go wrong, right?<br />
Lots of things, actually. First things first lets point out the obvious: it looks and sounds simple and bland. Not memorable in any light, good or bad. But things get worse with more importaint stuff, sadly.<br />
The main problem of the show - characters. When you have slice of life, you need characters whom we will follow. And to say that heroes here are bland and generic - is to say nothing. They are so bland that they will go out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317728">
        of your memory the second you finish this anime: MC, Dale, is slightly irritating with his LATINA IS CUTE, but he does almost nothing (excluding being slightly irritating), Latin - the daughteru of the show - despite being called cute all the time can hardly be qualified to be called one - she is just as plain and boring as everyone else. The rest of the cast is even more generic - here is your set of friends with zero characters, some old friends of Dale who appear a few times and act more like decorations for the main duo, and not like characters. Oh, don&#039;t forget that everyone loves Latina for no reason - which is strange, we are told that there are armed conflicts with demons so a bit of xenophobia should be expected, even more so when it is middle ages fantasy world. By the way, little is told about the world itself, a few bits of info is all that you get, though I didn&#039;t expect world building from this title.<br />
Enjoyment? Well, I would say this anime is a good watch before you go to bed, to fall asleep faster. It is boring, it is slow, it has nothing to capture your attention - dont waste your time on this mediocrity.

    In a season where literally every show is average, there is one gem that I look forward to each week. Not only is UchiMusume the cutest thing I have ever seen, but it is also the most relatable as well.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty much identical to other CGDCT shows (except that there&#039;s really only one CG here), in that there is no real story. Some random dude named Dale finds a cute loli demon (literally just a human girl with horns) and decides to adopt her. Everything after that is just Latina acting cute.<br />
<br />
At this point, you might be wondering why I gave this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313798">
        a 10. What separates this from other moeblob shows? Really, that&#039;s quite simple: Latina is the single cutest loli in the history of anime. ....that&#039;s it. Next section.<br />
<br />
Dale also happens to be the single most relatable character I&#039;ve ever seen. Indeed, I felt a spiritual connection to him when he shouted &quot;NOT ENOUGH LATINA&quot; after Latina hadn&#039;t been on screen for about 8 minutes. Other such outbreaks are ever-present in the show, as Dale&#039;s only purpose is to be obsessed with Latina and dramatically over-react whenever they are separated. His voice acting is incredible and really helps capture his character. Listening to Bakugou&#039;s VA fawn over a loli is an enlightening experience.<br />
<br />
While the animation might be somewhat lacking at times, the art is incredible. I find it difficult to believe that this is the studio&#039;s first show, but apparently, it is. The OST and OP/ED are quite unremarkable, but who cares. You&#039;re here for the cute loli, not the music.

    Young adventurer meets small demon girl in woods after said girls father died. Result? Most wholesome anime of summer season of 2019. From first moments of first episode you can tell its going to be something special and rest of season kept getting better and better. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Dont expect much action, but plenty of great and wholesome moments. I do like it doesnt shy away from darker side as well from time to time, yet it manages to do it so that it doesnt ruin shows tone. And it actually does manage to paint out larger picture of world as well. Essentially, i&#039;d say viewers point

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317727">
        of view and knowledge of said world is quite similar to Latina&#039;s (the little demon girl), of course with few advantages, such as seeing her guardian Dale (the adventurer) at work. So worldbuilding is actually better than it might first appear and is very well done<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
This is where this show truly shines. Pretty much every character is fleshed out and even one-off characters (which there are remarkably few of) have something, anything that gives them some level of depth. And of course main cast grows a lot. This shows truly how much care is put into this.<br />
Voice actors also put effort in what they do and it shows.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; animation:<br />
Art is just beautiful and animation is on most part good as well. The world of this anime is colorful and vibrant, yet it also pulls of darker tones such as rain or forest at night off superbly as well. It really makes it all feel alive.<br />
Only complaint about this show is, however, in here as combat animation doesnt hold up for the rest and there can be bit too much &quot;talking heads&quot; bits (nowhere near the level of death note though), but it doesnt take away from this show<br />
<br />
Overall: if you want to feel good, definite reccommendation.

    There’s a joke these days about light novel adaptations having ridiculous long names. News flash, there’re not getting any shorter. Translated as “If It’s for my Daughter, I’d Even Defeat a Demon Lord”, the series at first sounded like it would be one big joke of itself. The idea of a demonic girl bonding with a human isn’t something new and many similar light novels tends to love these ideas to death. Fortunately, this show didn’t kill itself.<br />
<br />
For starters, this almost feels like a niche show targeting at specific audiences. Some people label it as a ‘fantasy Usagi Drop’ while others sees it more as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317762">
        a coming of age fantasy adventure, one without chaotic battles. In essence, it mixes together slice of life in a fantasy adventure story. At the heart of the show is the relationship between Dale and Latina, the two protagonists who meets under what seems like a destined encounter. <br />
<br />
Dale is what people would call an everyman protagonist who takes on the role of an adventurer. It is however noticeable of how skilled he is and even having a reputation in his world. After meeting a strange devil girl in the woods during one of his missions, he adopts Latina as her guardian. That’s about as simple as it sounds, right? Most people usually designate this type of anime as a textbook example of slice of life. There’s the everyday adventures as characters experiences the mundane elements of life. This anime drops the characters into a fantasy world where there’s a blend between fiction and realism. My first impression of Latina is that she is a lost child who needs someone to guide her. Because of her demonic heritage, some people may misunderstand her as a character. The term ‘demonic’ tends to be a word associated with chaos and evil. However, Latina is the antithesis of this term as she is a kind and gentle girl. As a child, she also display a great deal of maturity compared to normal children. In early episodes, she feels lost but quickly adapts with the new environment around her. Thanks to Dale, she begins to learn more about people and enjoying what it’s like to be alive.<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned before, this anime defines the importance of an emotional relationship. Its commitments comes with Dale’s personality and how he truly wants to help Latina understand the world. In his role, Dale acts as a parental guardian and treats Latina like his daughter. The two grows incredibly fond of each other to the point where Dale thinks about Latina all the time while away on missions. Needless to say, Latina also misses him when he’s not around. And if anyone decides to harm Latina, think again. Dale may seem like a gentle person on the outside but if someone dares to hurt Latina, he’s going to show you a side you won’t forget. It’s the type of parenting 101 that comes from parents’ love for their child. The type of bond between a parent and child is special and that’s something we get to see a lot between Dale and Latina. <br />
<br />
For all its lighthearted and fluffy storytelling, there’s also moments in the show that can get violent and dark. For instance, Latina is subjected to prejudice because of her demonic heritage. Not everyone accepts Latina for who she is and there are even some characters going as far as to publically humiliate her. In response, Latina tries to show that she can be human and even goes as far as cutting off one of her own horns. The general consensus here is what constitute human behavior. In the case of Latina, she does her best to show as someone who is pure and kind, not like the type of character some perceive to her to be. She even goes far to prove herself with action such as healing an injured boy. At school, she makes new friends such as Chloe, Silvia, and Antony. Luckily for her, Dale’s influence also brings the best out of Latina’s personality. His intervention in one of the episode also shows exactly how much he cares about her. <br />
<br />
Yet, it’s understandable that some people may find this anime hard to invest into. It’s rather niche with the way it builds its main characters. If you’ve seen anime such as Usagi Drop and Sweetness &amp; Lightning, there’s a familiar feel with its character relationship. And to address the elephant of the room, there’s definitely a noticeable age difference between the two main leads. The anime adaptation only focuses on their parent/daughter-like relationship but I heard that the light novels goes far deeper into more than that. If you want to know, go look into the light novels.<br />
<br />
The first time I’ve saw the promos and key visual, I knew the art style would be a match. Maho Film’s debut makes an impression of being able to make this fantasy world come to life. The lush landscapes and handcrafted architectures has richness with realism. The director may have not made a great impression on his previous projects but this one stands out as a meaningful fantasy slice of life. Character designs are also delicate and made with care, in particular with a character like Latina. The way she is crafted brings out her character’s innocence while Dale dresses as how an adventurer should look. Some episodes also decorates Latina in charming outfits as a way to make her as human as possible.<br />
<br />
Rather than being portrayed as a joke or meme, this is one anime I can recommend despite being somewhat of a niche. It blends elements of slice of life with every episode telling a story of its own. The importance of Dale and Latina’s relationship is highlighted as the story progresses. It’s the type of slice of that works in conjunction with its fantasy elements. With 12 episodes, this has an easy pacing that can be enjoyed by almost anyone.

    Latina is ~uwu~ massively full-on cute and innocent as both a child and young girl, but the anime is so NOT my taste, even as a fan of the Iyashikei (relax and feel good) genre plus some SoL fantasy realism, which like many others, is slowly and constantly being overrun by more emerging isekai stories, both good and bad. If you like it, then good for you, but it is hits and misses after one another for me.<br />
<br />
In any case, the SUPER long name (what&#039;s up with long LN names) that is UchiMusume, tells the set-up (there&#039;s no story) of Dale Reki, an adventurer with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317729">
        a seemingly nice personality, and (like Kirito in terms of power and recognition) a well-versed one whom more often than not is looked upon as the &quot;role model&quot;...that is until his usual shenanigans beholded the sight of a young loli demon girl in a forest, known as Latina. And as with every budding family, she is abandoned by her family due to the complexity of Demon Lords residing within the human landscape, and her presence there is meant for humans to kill her. Heck, she even has a mark of a criminal, so that is saying something truly perplexing. So as with any kind young adult thinking, 18-year-old Dale must uphold the responsibility to custodially adopt Latina in the extremely safest way possible as a growing parent/father, even as the other people residing in his hometown is aware that Demon Lords are on the loose (even though there is such a timeskip of some sort before Latina ever showed up), that Latina could ANYTIME become the next target.<br />
<br />
And as such, taking care of a young child is NO CHILD&#039;S PLAY. To the majority of us who have handled kids before, Dale is the character to relate to, as Latina is moeblob (and I mean for real). And since he is voiced by the same VA who did MHA&#039;s Bakugo, his constant screaming and whining at the early stages may come across as a hindrance, but that&#039;s due to how young kids at the ages between 3 to 6 are (that Latina falls under from the get-go) and how they enact the world around them with overwhelming sweetness, adding onto their innocent faces and (good) heart-breaking tenderful kindness. It&#039;s definitely not hard to see someone as capable as Dale become a worrywart for Latina, even though she is growing up to be a star that lights up his mundane life, and to the other townsfolk who frequent his staying place, the bar tavern where there are many uncles who drink heartily after a long day&#039;s work. Plus, how can you NOT squeal at Latina where she&#039;s already working at a young, tender age and calm the hearts of both men and women? That&#039;s child labour I&#039;m calling out to! Plus, I really commend Latina&#039;s VA Takao Kanon, being Maou-sama, Retry!&#039;s Ram/Rem ripoff MC girl Aku also, that means both MC leading roles in the same season, WOW. *claps*<br />
<br />
But hey, for both Kenneth and Rita who serves as Dale&#039;s caretakers, noticing a bigger issue warrants more considerable action to duty, and hiding the fact that they know that Latina is both a demon girl, but at the same time, the little, budding child who has just gotten used to learning the ways of the world. Be it hunting; visiting parents and her ancestors with Dale, going to school and talking to classmates, learning how to cook and bake food with great caretakers Kenneth and Rita, Latina is mastered them with time to spare and keeping that innocence and immeasurable amounts of kindness, like how many children ought to act in this day and age. And it&#039;s nice that overtime, Dale (or rather the Bakugo inside of him) learns to cut his excessive obsession down as Latina ages, while acknowledging that as she learns to cope with the seemingly outside stuff that may or may not be favourable to her, both of them cast the same journey (as to reference: the footprints in the sand), that&#039;s honestly when the anime got a tad better at its episodic story structure. Furthermore, answering more about Latina&#039;s origins, while that may be the main crux of the show, it felt like canon at times, but I will say that when it needs to focus on any aspect of the world-building around the characters, full attention from start to finish. That, I give a clap.<br />
<br />
And what&#039;s up with new studios trying to break the bank with their premiere shows. Maho Film, yet ANOTHER new firm that is established in May 2018, marks this as their very first foray into anime production, and all I can say is that the production staff there, as much as they are newcomers and amateurs into the anime industry, they certainly did a very good job establishing a foothold for many new and small studios that are to come in the future (to tackle the industry-wide problem that is quantity over quality and with decent pay to staff in the footsteps of KyoAni). That&#039;s not to say that they made some occasional blunders though, as the art is somewhat lacking (same colour palette for both back and foreground, which shouldn&#039;t be a nitpick but it did for me) and the animation a bit stiff at times, but overall nothing overbearing to the points of complaint. In fact, it all looks good to the eye. Certainly, an all-rounded good job for a young, budding start.<br />
<br />
The OST is once again decent. Not much to say about both the OP and ED which comes across as average-sounding, but with the comfy and soothing atmosphere spreaded all around, I can&#039;t say that I liked or disliked it, but rather, gives off a sense of non-existent tension that absolutely nothing could ever discourse the relationship between Dale and Latina, in their journeys of wilderness and growth.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s great to have such shows like this garner some attention as we don&#039;t get a lot of Iyashikei anime nowadays, and I can bet that UchiMusume will be some fan favourites, just focusing on Latina, and Latina alone. Most impressively, the whole world is her oyster. As mentioned, if you like such parent-bonding shows like this, go ahead and watch, I can guarantee it will be a good one, but you&#039;d have to sacrifice your sense of hearing at first (no pun intended) to get to the goodness of it all that is the young loli demon girl oozing as much love as she could all day long.

    I wasn&#039;t really planning to watch UchiMusume this season, as the name gave me the vibe of your everyday typical isekai trash that we see pretty much every season, but to my surprise, the community actually seemed to like it. So at 1:00 in the morning, I open up kissani-, I mean Crunchyroll, binge-watch all the 8 episodes and let me tell you I couldn&#039;t have been more disappointed. <br />
<br />
With most of the people that watched this anime having liked it so far, I too tried my best to not be the sour one. Sadly, I couldn&#039;t find a single reason to like this series

        and give it a score of more than 4. With mediocre main storyline, to badly written characters, from awful character progression or development, as you may call it to lazy art, the only saving graces that didn&#039;t make me rate this series any lower are those few and far between wholesome moments that stay true to the core plotline. Let me explain what I mean.<br />
<br />
The story is not outright horrendous, but its also not something amazing, being mediocre at best. Basically, an adventure meets a cute little loli in the jungle and takes her in. If it were 2010 this would have been a newer storyline, still mediocre but new. As of 2019, there are few people who have not watched something similar with better characters and execution. Nothing much to talk about here as the writer decided to make this so average, I can&#039;t even criticize that. But what I can criticize is the characters. Don&#039;t even get me started how badly these characters are written. The mc is your avg op isekai protagonist, but not in an isekai, your female main character is your avg isekai first heroine, the damsel in distress, but in loli form factor and not in an isekai. That&#039;s it. The side characters are all some random mobs who just happened to get some screen time.<br />
<br />
I probably think the writer was like, &quot;Is our loli lonely? Here you have some friend. Is our protagonist not powerful enough? Here you have some political power. Do you lack character depth? Here you go some character develop- Oh I forgot we don&#039;t do that here.&quot; I have seen some worse writings but this one does not fare better than them.<br />
<br />
The sound acting is actually not that bad. With, of course, Latina being the emphasis. Nothing outstanding but nothing terrible, a simple 5. But oh boy.. the art goes along with the worse of this season. With badly drawn background, to shabby work on the interiors, along with lazy action scenes, I had to force myself to sit through those * episodes. From what I know, the art on the light novel was much much better than the shitshow we have been presented here. <br />
<br />
Finally, did I enjoy this? Not one bit. To be honest, UchiMusume was painful to watch. With so much potential out there, someone out there had to go and animate this.<br />
<br />
Verdict; Who should watch this and who should not? If you&#039;re new into anime and have no baseline at the moment, you could enjoy this anime, or if you&#039;re really into lolis being the focus(sarcasm btw) then sure go ahead watch Uchimusume. <br />
But if you&#039;re like me, tired of all the recent typical isekai bs and want something good with decent characters. a good story and animated by a studio that actually wants to draw it, I kindly suggest you do not waste your time here. <br />

    If it&#039;s for my Daughter, I&#039;d Even Defeat a Demon Lord is quite possibly the most adorable show you will ever see and I recommend giving it a watch. <br />
<br />
This show offers practically the sweetest little anime girl you will ever witness along with the ever-so caring, yet badass Dale who loves Latina more than anything else in the world. This dynamic is refreshing and pleasant in the way it&#039;s presented and allows this anime to earn such a high score. <br />
<br />
Not only does the mystery element behind Latina rope you in, but the story is executed in a well-paced manner and gets entertaining in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313928">
        places you do not expect, surprising you and keeping you on your toes. The story shows potential especially involving the little knowledge we have about the world and the glimpses we get of the workings. <br />
<br />
The side characters are enjoyable and contribute to the story very well, the animation is fitting to the series though some errors can be spotted and the music is sweet. The opening and ending are cute, Latina sings the opening and Dale sings the ending. Main characters Latina and Dale have a lovable relationship that makes you want to see them every week. Dale is obsessed with Latina and you can&#039;t help but get obsessed too. He&#039;s easily such a likeable character, considering how he&#039;s the top adventurer in the city but turns into utter mush whenever he sees Latina do basically anything or whenever has to leave her. Poor guy just wants to see his little Latina, his Papa bear side has to be the best thing ever. <br />
<br />
Anyways, watch the show. Don&#039;t second guess or doubt it, just watch it. It&#039;s genuinely entertaining and you&#039;ll get a kick out of seeing the living paradox that is Latina doing mundane chores like cleaning and cooking. Dale as a parent is an exact representation of us when we see Latina, let&#039;s all just agree to protect Latina at all costs.

    [minimum spoiler review]<br />
[long-ish review ahead]<br />
<br />
A really cute and relaxing show with a nice atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Nowadays it seems like every medium to big sized anime with a good rating has a catch to it, be it the plot, the art, the characters or something else, you get the point.<br />
This anime has its own catch - its cuteness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I watch it?&quot;<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY: 8<br />
The story isn&#039;t a complex plot, but rather a quite simple and straight foward idea.<br />
It&#039;s mainly slice of life based on a fantasy world which has demons, adventurers, quests, etc.<br />
So far in the anime (until episode 6), everything happens pretty much the same as in the manga,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314378">
        with slight deviations. Should the anime follow this pattern, the story is well translated from manga to anime, and is above average in terms of quality and originality.<br />
Even if the anime&#039;s stated genres are fantasy and slice of life, it also fits well into the demon, magic, mystery and romance (as in romance between parent and child).<br />
There are traces and hints of mystery, but they don&#039;t lead to huge plot twists but rather to unknown, interesting and unexpected backstories.<br />
;<br />
Summarized, the MC, Dale, a somewhat famous and skilled adventurer, finds, in a forest, a girl which belongs to the demon race. She takes the adorable little girl home and becomes her adoptive father. As I&#039;m pretty sure many of us have (or will), Dale got attached to the cute demon and starts living life as a caring father.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART: 7<br />
The art in this anime is a bit above average.<br />
While some scenes seem to lack in expressiveness, most are really cute. Even so, the occasional numb-feeling and poor scenes made my scoring for this category go lower.<br />
Then again, while some scenes are not so great, others are the cutest I&#039;ve seen in years, and I mean it.<br />
The design and drawing of most scenes are not too complex. In fact, they&#039;re rather simple. But there&#039;s no connection between complexity and quality. Sure, some scenes feel rushed and maybe stiff, but most of the time these bads are overwhelmed by the goods - cuteness and atmosphere.<br />
;<br />
The art is pretty much average, with some not-so-nice stiff scenes every now and then; most scenes however are just simply too good and cute to let this scoring of the art go any lower.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8<br />
I usually pay attention to sound in movies and anime. But while watching this anime, something rather unusual happened - I didn&#039;t really notice the sound. That&#039;s a good thing. Sound isn&#039;t made to attract your attention, but rather to help and build the desired atmosphere.<br />
The music is well placed and fits the scenes properly. Usually you know the music is good when it doesn&#039;t stand out too much, and when it does it&#039;s because it&#039;s good. Other times, when music stands out it&#039;s because it&#039;s bad and out of place. In this anime, it&#039;s the former. Although only 5 episodes have been released, the music did catch my attention for being really good and really well placed a few times.<br />
The sound effects are nothing to complain about. I&#039;m honestly really happy they aren&#039;t overused or exaggerated.<br />
The voice acting, however, is a different story. While Latina&#039;s voice (the demon girl) is really good and really, and I repeat, REALLY good (for real, it&#039;s so damn cute), Dale&#039;s voice is sometimes lacking. His voice, occasionally, sounds numb, stiff, rushed and, overall, just plainly bad. Fortunately, these occurrences are rare, and Latina&#039;s sweet and lovely voice is more than enough to compensate.<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9<br />
One word: adorable.<br />
I don&#039;t really know how to explain my feelings for the characters in this anime, as I&#039;m not used to actually ENJOYING cuteness. Most anime which want to make a character very cute fail, but this one doesn&#039;t. I&#039;m honestly amazed. I&#039;m not the type of person who watches slice of life, and neither am I the type of person to find things cute, in general.  Heck, I hate kids. But this anime has did it for me - it managed to make me really enjoy a slice of life anime, it managed to create a character that I adore a lot and it managed to make me go head over heels over a cute kid. Amazing.<br />
But, as with all things in life, there is a bad(-ish) side to the characters as well - they aren&#039;t really that well built, apart from Latina. Dale seems like it has a really boring backstory, with nothing too interesting apart from him being skilled; the other characters don&#039;t have much of a backstory. But, since this is a slice of life, I understand that.<br />
This section gets a 9 - the characters are good and Latina is just amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
It&#039;s amazing how just 5 episodes of a random anime I&#039;ve picked up managed to raise my mood and make me desperately want the next episode to air.<br />
Considering that I don&#039;t usually watch slice of life, that I&#039;m not usually impressed by cuteness and that I&#039;m definitely not a kid-loving type of person, it&#039;s really amazing how this anime, in just 5 episodes, managed to amaze me.<br />
I really enjoy it, and it&#039;s really relaxing. That&#039;s pretty much what I have to say on my enjoyment. It&#039;s a 10 for this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 8<br />
It&#039;s an unique experience, something I haven&#039;t seen before, and I&#039;m really glad that I&#039;ve picked it up. It&#039;s extremely relaxing, charming and cute.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I watch it?&quot;<br />
Yes.

    Short and simple: this serie is perfect. Why? Because Latina is the CUTEST LOLI IN ANIME HISTORY!!... Yep, that&#039;s it. Nothing more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s forget about how shallow the worldbuilding is. This is your typical fantasy world with adventurers, magic, mystical criatures and different races where all of those topics were barely touched because of course, you have seen them thousands times before and you don&#039;t need to get them introduced in this story. This is all about Latina!! not about... non-Latina things!!. Now you might be thinking: &quot;Hey! But this is a SoL anime, not an adventure one&quot;, and yes, that&#039;s true, but you still need

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317775">
        to develop your world in order to complement characters growth with their environment, especially when one of them is a demon child (a supposedly hated race) and the other is an adventurer (a supposedly important one). But who needs logic and actual worldbuilding here when you have you cute loli eating desserts and wanting to learn how to cook? Latina is such an ADORABLE SWEETHEART!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s forget about how mediocre audiovisual features are. Plain backgrounds, simplistic colour palette, forgettable soundtrack and inconsistent characters design. From facial deformities to shifting heights; I didn&#039;t even know if Latina was naturally growing up or chara designer could not decide how old he wanted her to look... But did you see Latina with that bear outfit? She&#039;s HELLA CUTE!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s forget about how weak the direction is. This serie suffers from a big plot rushing, even for a SoL anime. One chapter Latina is learning how to talk and the next one she&#039;s got an almost full vocabulary. One chapter she is pretty clumsy at serving glasses and the next one she&#039;s an expert. One chapter Latina meets some children and the next one they are lifelong friends. You don&#039;t have to fully show those trivial things but natural progression is basically non-existent. This is made worse by weak direction where transitions and timeskips are not clear enough. How much time had passed? Just some hours? One day? A weak? Three months!!? We&#039;ll never know. But time is a unimportant concept when we have Latina filling up our empty lifes. SO FUCKING KAWAII~!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s forget about how this serie is terrible with mood handling. Comedy and -supposedly- quiet moments are so over-the-top with Dale yelling all the time that end up being the opposite they tried to be. And serious issues like discrimination are so exaggeratedly and superficially portrayed that can&#039;t be taken with the correct seriousne- I mean, how dare that stupid bitch to harm Latina like that while doing Kakegurui faces with no subtlety at all!! SHE DESERVES TO FUCKING DIE!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s forget about how bland characters are. Latina is fin- I mean, SHE&#039;S PERFECT!! It&#039;s good seeing how she grows up and learns, but of course it&#039;s not her fault if the world is so black and white where everyone loves her like a kind of godness or hates her like she was the Demon Lord itself. How did I dare to say our beloved Latina is a kind of mary sue? of course not!! Dale is pretty much your average adventure anime MC, but he&#039;s kind of an special hero. What kind of &quot;special&quot;? Who knows, that was never clarified even when his influency was notorious. Then what is Dale&#039;s function? I guess being just an important person for Latina. How? I guess being a paternal model who doesn&#039;t even act as proper one, because most of the time he&#039;s just there yelling &quot;NOT ENOUGH LATINA&quot;, but I guess that&#039;s enough for normal people to find him as &quot;the most relatable character ever&quot;.... Oh right, he calmed down a bit during the traveling arc (actually the best part of the serie when some of the issues like the worldbuilding and characters bond were fixed up a bit) and we finally saw him as a proper character out of the Latina thing and with a -wait for it- 5 seconds flashback!! It&#039;s a shame that doesn&#039;t count as character development (the sooner people realize showing characters pasts is not character development, world will be a better place). <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast? They are... ok... I guess. They are not Latina, that&#039;s the only important thing here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: I CAN&#039;T GET ENOUGH LATINA/10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    The story is about an adventurer that find&#039;s a child (Latina) in the forest and decides to adopt her.<br />
<br />
I really liked the idea of having a show about adopting and raising a kid<br />
<br />
The characters are fun but the main focus is on Latina and her guardian Dale <br />
<br />
Latina is an extremely cute kid, probably the ideal type of kid any parent would wish for, sweet, understanding and compassionate.<br />
<br />
Dale becomes enamored in the cuteness of Latina and becomes a very protective guardian.<br />
<br />
The show is one of those types that you would watch to get cured of your anger, after I watch a show that has me

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316094">
        extremely irritated I just watch an episode or two of this and im cured!!<br />
<br />
Get cured of annoying anime today!

    What an absolutely adorable anime this was. The story follows Dale, and a little devil-girl that he rescues from the forest during one of his adventures. I have to say, that Latina is one of the cutest anime characters ever. Watching her grow up and learn things throughout the anime was an absolute joy, and the cast of characters made that journey super enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Story: like a lot of slice of life type anime’s, there isn’t a giant overall story. This show just kinda follows the characters daily lives, and the very early years of Latina. Whether it’s just learning to cook, and help out around

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317721">
        the Tavern, or travel to Dales hometown, this show covers not only Latinas growth, but, also Dales, as he takes on the responsibility of being a parent/guardian.<br />
<br />
Art: Talk about drawing an absolutely precious anime character. Latina has this grown man saying “aww” a whole lot. All the characters in this show are drawn with heart to be honest. Dale, Kenneth, Rita, her classmates, or the adventurers that frequent the tavern, they all have their own quirks, and are lovable in their own ways.<br />
<br />
Sound: The opening gets the job done, it’s cute, for a cute show. I have one gripe with the sound, and that’s Dale. He can be super overbearing, and sometimes annoying. It was something that bothered me a lot early, but I get accustomed to later on, and it didn’t bother me as much at that point. Otherwise, the score is well done, and the voice acting for Latina is 10/10.<br />
<br />
Characters: as I talked about in the art segment, I think the character development for everyone was well done. You could see the characters growing based on Latinas presence. Everyone grew up, and everyone grew to love Latina. Dale was one of the more interesting character, just for the fact that, you could see him going through the hardships of parenthood.<br />
<br />
What can I say? I loved this. I’ll be sad to see it go. But, I always enjoy having one of these feel good anime’s in my repertoire for a season, and this one certainly didn’t disappoint. If you like Slice of Life. For sure give this one a try.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

    Cuteness and parenting: The anime<br />
<br />
In a stacked season full of quality series(currently watching 6 in addition to my plan to watch list and light novels), this bad boy stands head and shoulders above the rest. Not only is Latina genuinely the cutest thing known to man(move over senko), but the series is genuinely a great ride and serves as a great de-stresser. Based on the light novel of the same name, Uchi is about young(18 young!) adventurer Dale and his adopted daughter Latina as they go through this thing called life and navigate all of its hurdles. The series does add a lot more actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314849">
        plot later down the line in the light novels, but so far in the anime, it&#039;s served as a great window into the daily challenges and struggles of a single parent. I can genuinely not recommend this series enough.<br />
<br />
Art is top notch, sound is great with a really nice soundtrack, characters are all really soundly written and have unique and distinguishable personalities. Basically, everyone serves a purpose. Enjoyment is of course an easy 10, I have not had this much fun watching something and just bubbled up with joy in a long time. I don&#039;t have kids yet, but I really feel that parental/fatherly instinct when I watch and read this series and I think that is a testament to great writing. Anytime you can make someone like me who&#039;s normally pretty selfish and in no rush to have kids want to have kids ASAP, you&#039;re doing something right. If you have a free slot on Fridays, I know it&#039;s a packed season with a lot of series, but I really suggest getting into this. It will be a great way to end your week.

    I first heard about this show from Joey the Anime Man when he did is previews of this season&#039;s anime and was intrigued with the premise. The idea of single parent slice of life with fantasy elements sounded really good, like mixing Skyrim with Usagi Drop or Sweetness and Lightning. I even bought the manga ahead of the series getting streamed on Cruchyroll. <br />
Boy, was I let down.<br />
After reading the manga, I set a really high bar for the anime, obviously too high. The art is bland and fails to capture the warmth of the original illustrations. The characters seem to be shells of their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315431">
        literary counterparts and the protagonist Dale is downright irritating. Moments of actual drama or action have so far been handled with awkward, clunky animation. This adaptation feels like a quick money grab for a studio unwilling to invest their time and effort into actually being faithful or producing quality.<br />
I only plan on continuing to watch this series as a study in comparing an anime with its source material. If you are interested in this story, read the manga. It&#039;s a better investment and definitely has a warmer, familial atmosphere.

    TL;DR <br />
A decent anime with a unique plot. just not quite for me.<br />
<br />
During the start of the show I was quite engrossed and was excited to watch  this anime, but as episodes came out, I could never really feel the attachment to the show that I wanted. It was different from what I usually watch, as I am more of a Action/Fantasy type of watcher but I wanted to get into watching currently airing shows.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
As the title &quot; If It&#039;s for My Daughter, I&#039;d Even Defeat a Demon Lord&quot; suggests. I had the thought of a bad-ass MC who had taken in care of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318424">
        a powerless girl and would do anything to protect her from harm or maybe even go as far as act revenge on those who had cast her aside. However, what I expected was quite far from reality as it really wasn&#039;t like this at all. Instead, I had started a show which focused more on of a &quot;Slice of Life&quot; basis, which I have nothing against, so I digressed. Though I quite like Slice of Life (even though it&#039;s not my main genre), I feel with this anime, It didn&#039;t really have a sense of direction thus not edging me on to watch the next episode.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art style was pleasant and seeing this from the first ep, I should&#039;ve guessed at this point it was going to be a more friendly show rather that Action-like. Due to this, not a heavy amount of fight scenes had to be animated. Putting this aside, the art-style was pleasant to watch and was unique in its own way.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP is alright but for me, it wasn&#039;t special or something that I could get in to. The soundtrack was overall quite good; Good timing, and nothing overpowering and changed appropriately to the atmosphere present.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I think we can all agree that Latina is a lovable character which can easily be portrayed by other character&#039;s reaction to her in the show. The downside for me is Dale; I&#039;m no father but I can sort of understand why he&#039;d be so protective but I felt that he was too protective. Yes, it was funny seeing his reaction but I felt that It was a bit over the top at points but that&#039;s just me. Don&#039;t let that put you off.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
During the end episodes, I couldn&#039;t find myself wanting to watch the next. Nothing really got me hooked to the show so my overall Enjoyment wasn&#039;t that high. However, there were parts during the show that made me smile and laugh which pushes that up.<br />
<br />
In Conclusion, I can understand what other people saw in this and trust me when I say, this is definitely not the worst show this season (not to name names but ummm Maou-sama, Retry!) lmao. But to conclude this show just wasn&#039;t for me.   <br />

    Uchi no Ko no Tame naraba, Ore wa Moshikashitara Maou mo Taoseru kamo Shirenai. (2019)<br />
<br />
What is this? Cute girl doing cute things that just feels so relaxing to watch. <br />
<br />
The story about a young orphan picked up by an adventurer that changes her life and his and also everyone around them. You see them grow closer in a father-daughter style manner as time goes forward. They have trails to overcome and adventures and friends to make. In the end, you have a really nice and relaxing story that is easy to watch and look forward too. <br />
<br />
The art style for this is really a delight

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317971">
        to watch, the main character Latina is a delight to have on-screen with everything she does being just adorable. Dale the other main is also very well done and it is fun to watch his reactions. <br />
<br />
The sounds that are in the show include a really fun and upbeat opening and closing. The sounds throughout are calm and soothing but also terrifying when needed. <br />
<br />
Characters don&#039;t get huge development outside of Dale and Latina but the show is about them directly and more so Latina is best developed. However, this is not an issue it is not the sort of show where you need to know everyone&#039;s family trees. The revelations although sometimes subtle are great to see about Latina. You do however have what seems to be important characters appears that you are almost expected to know. <br />
<br />
The show as can be seen above is really a joy to watch. It came out in really good time since so many shows are just super serious or complete comedy. Although I haven&#039;t watch everything this year it is very much up there in the calmest anime of the year to watch and enjoy. <br />
<br />
A second season would be amazing and it would be great to be animated throughout to the end of the story. Be mindful, however, that father-daughter relationship does turn into a bit more... intimate one day with how life spans and such work. But with that in mind remember it is a show in another world you cannot apply earthly morals to it.

    Uchi no Ko no Tame naraba, Ore wa Moshikashitara Maou mo Taoseru kamo Shirenai. The story was very simple, the flow of the anime was stable, but for a change that&#039;s what make this anime unique, not always being complicated means that this what makes the story good, sometimes the simplicity makes also the story a good story, in addition to the cuteness of the main character, that i guess all the otaku people in the world won&#039;t be able to resist :D including myself, overall i really enjoyed this anime and i hope there will be a second season for it :).

     I have been in to anime for a few decades now and unfairly, this anime is one of those that has been drowned in low ratings, due to the nature of its name making people, maybe, expect this to be an action-filled-well-packed anime of sorts, but when in reality it&#039;s not exactly what it is about.<br />
 This is more of a mature plot oriented anime, it focus on a entirely different aspect, child raising that transcend race and even family bounds.<br />
 Fights are kept to a minimum, since they aren&#039;t the main nature or plot of the anime it self, but rather, focus entirely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317881">
        on character development, cultural diferences and values of this world. (And no, its not an Isekai, its a Fantasy.)<br />
<br />
(Story) - Spoil Free -<br />
 The story is focused entirely on an Adventure that finds a Child Demon wondering in a dangerous forest alone. These two have some troubles on communicating, since both come from different places, are from different Races and different kingdoms. Although, the Adventurer, with a &quot;broken language skills&quot; its eventually able establish a mean of communication somewhat with the Demon, things move on from here.<br />
Eventually he finds out there is nobody to take care of this small demon (which has a peculiarity in one of its horns, that raises high suspicion) and can not fend for it self. Plot wise, this will mainly focus on the life of these two, that&#039;s the key plot definitely. But fell free to watch it yourself from here on, things start to get interesting. Magicians, Demons, Elfs, Mystical Creatures, its a world packed with those &lt;3.<br />
<br />
(Art&amp;Sound)<br />
 Its a little generic, but the feelings get pass across without an issue. Plus I think it fits well with the theme. If you saw stuff like Usagi Drop, it falls on that category although a little on the more fantasy style.<br />
<br />
(Character)<br />
Its mainly about these two, the Adventurer and the Child Demon. Don&#039;t want got too much in detail here, since this is what makes this anime shine to our eyes. But to put it blunt, although the theme of the story sort of gloomy, the characters are quite up bright. You will definitely look forward to it.<br />
<br />
(Enjoyment)<br />
I couldn&#039;t possibly not enjoy this, as I tend to favor more mature animes over wacky Shonens where protagonists pull special skills out of god knows where and bamm kabamm everything and kills enemys for no reason. This one does quite a good job at explaining and keep things simple in a way you can enjoy it without much ado. Definitely kept me and my mumm hooked up till the end and wishing for more.<br />
<br />
(Overall)<br />
Definitely giving it a 10 this anime more then deserves a bit fat 9 at the very least. Always love to watch a more &quot;realistic&quot; range of emotions along with mutal interactions among the cast. I believe, the older you are, the more enjoyable this series will be for you. PLEASE DO GIVE IT A CHANCE!

    This review may contain spoilers.<br />
I will start with the community reaction to this anime. Most people called it lolicon anime and hated it from the very beginning. In my opinion this anime is a literal gem compared to tons of cheap isekai animes of this season. It&#039;s also one of the most heartwarming animes I have seen in a while. Alongside with clannad this anime makes me wanna have a daughter UwU<br />
<br />
Story (9/10): The story is located in a cliché world where there are adventurers, guilds, magic, demons and stuff. But what I certainly enjoyed is that there are no overpowered magic user that oneshots

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317809">
        anything. There is a life out of magic and combat, there are normal kids going to school and stuff. What Im trying to say is this anime is unlike the other animes int this world setting. The animes with this world setting normally has OP magicians, everyone&#039;s families are dead or they have some sort of background like that, everyone except the the protagonist&#039;s  friends are a villiain etc.<br />
To abridge, this anime shows us this boring bs world setting can be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10)<br />
The characters weren&#039;t so bad close up but when viewing characters from different aspects or  showing them form a distance they looked somewhat weird. Same goes with the action scenes, although it&#039;s not all that bad the frames were minimal in some scenes. The eyes were unique (especially Latina&#039;s) and I liked them. Character art aside I really enjoyed the BG art. The landscapes or the towns they visited, they were beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound (9/10)<br />
I don&#039;t have much to say here. I both liked the opening and the ending Latina singing the opening and Dale singing the ending was pretty cute and good. The opening reflected Latina&#039;s happines while exploring the new warm world she has come to well. The OST&#039;s were mostly good.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10) <br />
I want to start with Dale. Dale is one of the best/strongest adventurers in his town and is pretty busy. Normally, the characters like this are edgy af cool af bois who oneshot everything whenever their theme is played. All they do is slaughter monsters, they dont have much of a life except combat and that&#039;s pretty much all they do. Unlike them Dale is a good adventurer in human standarts. He is clever, he is strong knows magic and has a good equipment on. He is not edgy and he is not a god who oneshots everything. Instead he is a normal human who has an ordinary life and ordinary emotions. He doesn&#039;t has unlimited power, money or stuff. He lives at the attic of an inn. He pays his rent and has a compassionate heart. He is even clingy to a little girl despite being strong. I loved how the anime showed us that the cool af oneshotter MC&#039;s are human too.<br />
<br />
Latina is the only one with a tragic background. Dale finds him in the forest all by herself and later learns that her parents are dead. Latina, after losing her all she&#039;s got clings to the man who showed him kindness and took him to home after all the hardships she&#039;s been through. As the anime progresses Latina learns Japanese and other human world stuff. It&#039;s certainly adorable to watch her learn and start interacting with other humans after getting used to Dale going to quests and stuff.<br />
<br />
The background characters didn&#039;t feature anything special. Latina&#039;s friends and The couple who runs the inn (Kenneth and Rita) supports Latina no matter what happens and watching that warms up your heart.<br />
<br />
My Personal Enjoyment (10/10)<br />
It was a pleasure to watch A little kid who&#039;s lost everything gets a helping hand from another race and grows up in that race. Starting Latina&#039;s first moments where she was literally glued to Dale to where she was going to school or shopping even to a friend&#039;s house. It was an adventure of a little girl and watching her grow up made me all fuzzy and happy.

    The story of this anime is revolves around the daily life of Latina and her interactions with other characters.  I liked the world building that this anime had throughout.  This anime has a fantasy setting, but it is not focused on combat as much which differentiates it from most other anime of the genre.  <br />
<br />
The animation is pretty standard with some quality dips.  I really enjoyed the art style and character designs from this anime.  <br />
<br />
The sound is pretty standard too.  No music really stood out to me besides the ending theme.  It was not bad, but it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317841">
        was not too memorable overall.<br />
<br />
My favorite thing about this anime is the characters.  Dale was a clingy dad to Latina, but his personality made for a lot of comedic scenes.  Latina`s interactions with other characters were very wholesome and entertaining.  The couple who runs the bar in the series were great insightful supporting characters.  I really enjoyed this anime for its comedy and wholesome moments.  If you like other lighthearted comedy anime I would definitely recommend this anime.

    Honestly I thought the kawaii elements alone would at least give me some motivation to complete the series but alas, it&#039;s garbage. So the main appeal for the show is the cuteness of the protagonist, daemon girl of mysterious origins. The story is not terrible but it&#039;s slow paced and uninteresting. The characters are so generic you could replace them with any other stereotype.<br />
This show is just so bland I gave up. I will admit though that the demon girl is cute, as plain as she may be.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Even if you don&#039;t care about the story and you&#039;re here just for the loli, I still can&#039;t
