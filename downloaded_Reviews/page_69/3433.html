    There are many animes out there that have perverted characters in them, in fact most do, but animes that focus completely on one characters perversion are few and far between. Most are terrible porn like crap, but some like MM manage to do all that is necessary to be respected in this genre, namely be funny and have good characters. <br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
The story follows Tarou who on the surface seems like a normal high school guy but in actual fact he&#039;s got a problem, he’s a hard core masochist (he experiences sexual pleasure from pain for those who didn’t know).Trouble is  he wants to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31747">
        normal, so on the advice of a friend he seeks help from a club called the 2nd Voluntary club. Were the leader of the club is a sadistic, egotistic girl who accepts the challenge of ridding Tarou of his masochism…<br />
While this story line is far from revolutionary it’s still something that I’ve never came across before, which makes it refreshing to know there’s still new ideas out there. It’s funny as hell watching Tarou get tortured or put in embarrassing situations. The idea of characters from anime being S or M has been around for a long time but this is the first show I’ve seen to make it the central theme of the story and it works great with plenty of great comedy and romance moments<br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
 The characters of this show are great and have more depth than you would first expect, while most seem cliché this actually make the show that much funnier as it’s great to see your stereotypical girls thrown into the world of S and M. Of course the backbone of this show is the strange relationship between Tarou (masochist) and Mio (sadist) which is no surprise but there is some good side characters in this show too, like Yuno Arashiko a girl with a terrible fear of men but she is able to like Tarou because his masochism makes so that he is very unlikely to hurt her. And another sadist (the school nurse) and Taros friend who i can’t say much about or id spoil too much.<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
As this anime is mostly a comedy there&#039;s quite a lot of jokes in it naturally. Most are S and M jokes but thankfully there&#039;s little to no echhi in this anime. The rest of the comedy is at the expense of Taro as he gets his gets violently beaten by women (mostly Mio) which does little to cure his problem, rather it aggravates it. The humour won’t appeal to everyone but i think it’s quite good and better than many other animes of this type out there at the moment.<br />
<br />
 -Art-    <br />
The art work is good, clean, clear but nothing that you wouldn&#039;t expect in this day and age but it helps make the show and its endless stock of jokes that much better.<br />
<br />
-Overall-<br />
Overall I greatly enjoy watching this anime and will continue to watch it to the end, the story’s refreshing , the humour is great, the characters are interesting, the arts good and overall it’s fun to watch. . Any fans of S&amp;M will really love this anime as it’s filled it so if you’re looking for something funny and not too serious then this is perfect for you. <br />

    Pre-notice: If you don&#039;t like bad things said about this, then don&#039;t read it. I don&#039;t want people having seizures and breaking stuff. Otherwise, keep in mind that this is based on the first 3 episodes. Maybe it&#039;ll get better later, maybe it&#039;ll get worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I first saw this anime on one of the download sites, I thought &quot;oh what the hell, let&#039;s give it a try. The art looks good&quot;. Well the art WAS good, but that was ALL that was good about this anime. A few episodes into the anime, I stopped seeing the point. I was tricked.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10)<br />
As I said before, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31573">
        art is amazing. In fact, very few anime has art this good. The character figures and coloring really gives the viewer a sense of how great anime can be without the horribly disfigured eyes that take up 2/3 of the face or hair that looks like helmets. Around 99% of my attention to this anime was put into studying the art in the first minute or so of the first episode. Unfortunately, this enthusiasm did not last...<br />
<br />
Story (2/10)<br />
The story is horrible and completely pointless. Before some of you decide to send me death threats and whatnot, read on because it&#039;s NOT because I&#039;m biased against masochism and other sexual disorders. This story is about a masochist guy Taro Sado, who wants to cure himself of the disorder so he can confess his love to a girl he sees while working at a shop. At this point I thought, &quot;ok that&#039;s fine, at least there is a goal in this anime plus the art is good&quot;. He joins the Second Volunteering Club to cure himself of this problem. At the club he gets beaten around by the loli president (who I later learned was Sadist. Crap that made sense) and the girl who caused his masochism in the first place. But then after the second episode, it turns out the girl he fell in love with  is just a cross-dressing guy who also happens to be his only best friend. Now, to me the plot is dead here. Given that the reason he was trying to cure his problem was to confess to that girl, now that he knows his first love was actually his best friend as a girl, what&#039;s the point of trying to cure his masochism? There is no reason why he&#039;s putting up with the three girls just beating the crap outta him and treating him crap other than &quot;because he enjoys it&quot;. But seriously, I&#039;m not going to watch an anime about people beating each other up because they all enjoy it. I&#039;ve got better things to do.<br />
<br />
Character (3/10)<br />
The characters suck because what they do doesn&#039;t make sense; it&#039;s like they lack half a brain or something. Sado is just pathetic. For example, although Yuno was the girl who caused Sado&#039;s masochism, she has no problem BAKA punching the crap out of him when he gets close due to her androphobia (fear of guys) even though it&#039;s mostly an accident. Not only does she NOT apologize for causing his &quot;perverted&quot; disorder, she treats him like a dog and constantly disparages him for the disorder that she caused. What&#039;s even more stupid is, despite this, Sado tries his hardest to help her and understand her. He even beats up the guy who caused her androphobia. Ironic isn&#039;t it, how he helps the girl who caused his disorder by beating up the guy who caused her disorder. What&#039;s more, ANOTHER arrogant little girl (OH BAT FLIPPIN GREAT) comes into the series and together, those three just beat the crap out of people day and night. Nothing annoys me more than little brats acting like all high and mighty and this anime hit that peeve in the face. <br />
<br />
Overall (3/10)<br />
Overall, the 3 came mostly from art. Other than that, nothing else seemed to be too great. I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. My lips were torn from biting my lips because I had to do so to bear watching it. It seems to me that although this anime could have been an attempt to combine romance and comedy, it had neither. There were too many scenes that I didn&#039;t even know HOW to respond to. I couldn&#039;t laugh because it wasn&#039;t funny; I couldn&#039;t feel sad because it wasn&#039;t sad and I couldn&#039;t say &quot;awwwwww, kawaiiii&quot; because I&#039;m not that kind of a person and there wasn&#039;t that kind of a scene. If you want to watch an anime with great art but otherwise just that, the try MM! out. Otherwise people like me who actually like to see something get done in anime have much better choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Don&#039;t bother sending me the &quot;you&#039;re a cold hearted bast**d!&quot; and &quot;You&#039;re too immature to understand the love and devotion&quot; comments because frankly, I Don&#039;t Care. If you think you understand, then don&#039;t read this review and just watch it.

    If you&#039;re looking for more of the same, then you&#039;re in luck. MM!, wittily titled after the protagonists masochism fetish, takes every character design and comedic gag as by the book as possible, for the absolute level of comfort viewing. MM! is enjoyable for what it is, a harem anime centered around a club that helps people, but it doesn&#039;t strive to go beyond it&#039;s original premise and ultimately that is where it falls short. Note that the numerical value I have awarded this anime with does not mean anywhere near as much as what I&#039;ve said textually about it.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
The story begins with Sado

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32920">
        having an uncontrollable urge to yell in joy about being abused by women. He seeks help by going to a certain club led by a self-proclaimed God named Mio. He later is introduced to an androphobic girl, a school nurse, crazy inventor, and even discovers his best friend enjoys cross-dressing. That&#039;s about as how deeply as the plot goes - you&#039;ve seen all of this before no doubt. MM! is like the foundation of a house that doesn&#039;t get built on. It doesn&#039;t provide anything more than a mindless viewing. Though I enjoyed a fair portion of the story about Yuno, even her story was riddled with cliche and lacked the depth other androphobic females have had in the past. I just felt let down after a very interesting exposition with nothing to support it thereafter. I had hopes Sado&#039;s masochism would be psychologically analyzed, possibly a reason why he enjoys being abused so much, but I was hoping for too much. The comedy in MM! was a turn-off for me. The anime is riddled with over-referenced anime and the physical abuse humor wears off by about the second episode. In short, MM! is not a show you watch for plot nor is it a show you watch for humor. I&#039;m unsure why you watch it then.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Harem&#039;s never let me down - every female had different color hair! Sadly though, the creativity doesn&#039;t extend further into the show. The art design looks like a sloppily made Kanokon or Ladies vs Butlers with a huge gloss effect applied. There are numerous moments of re-used animation, ridiculous unattractive facial distortion, and awkward movements. As for the backgrounds, nothing to complain about for a school anime, but once again nothing that sets it apart.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
A saving grace in my opinion. I enjoyed Ayana Taketatsu (Azusa Nakano from K-ON!) as Mio, and at first I was a little worried on how I&#039;d feel about her voicing a dirty-mouthed blonde girl but there was no reason for fretting. Her voice was the funniest thing in the anime. The OP &quot;Help!!&quot; was great in both versions of it being sung. The ED was also pleasant to my ears but it was nothing too notable. <br />
<br />
Character: 5/10<br />
Sado - likes being hit by women<br />
Mio - likes hitting Sado, and her excuse is that by hurting him a lot he will be cured of his masochistic illness<br />
Yuno - like Inari from Working! but less cute and less believable as a character<br />
Noa - loli who invents things that usually end up with a Dragon Ball reference (frustrating amounts of them)<br />
The rest - characters that a harem anime would most likely have in it<br />
<br />
I should be grateful that at least one character had decent development in this anime, because expecting any development from a harem anime is silly to begin with. The characters were all good enough, but once again they were weak and for the most part unlikable. Between all the fists flying in this anime (used as tools of perversion for Sado) and the ridiculous plot development (Noa tries to make all men in the world perverted at one point - this is not an anime to take seriously) it was hard to really make room for characters I guess.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
I watched an episode of MM! a week, and then it ended. I will undoubtedly delete this anime off my computer and move along with the next anime Xebec has to offer. MM! did nothing but consume my time each week without instilling any feelings for the anime. Of course as harem standards go, MM! is not poor - it has a decent amount of fanservice and the protagonist isn&#039;t an asshole. That in and of itself is enough to make it passable, but there are harem anime that are at least more interesting out there.<br />
<br />
Overall: 5/10<br />
Unless you&#039;re new to anime MM! won&#039;t spark more than a passing glance. The phrase holds true - once you&#039;ve seen one harem anime, you&#039;ve seen them all.

    Taro is sick in the head. Mio is sick in the head. Yuno is sick in the head. I think you can understand where this leading. Fundamentally, every single character in this anime is sick to the extreme at one dimension of their personality.<br />
<br />
MM! is a story about the curing of a closet masochist by a sadist and the resulting shenanigans involving an androphobic, cross dresser, cult leader, prodigious inventor, lolicon etc. etc. It&#039;s basically a freak show, a twisted school drama, an exhibition of corrupted youths. But is that good?<br />
<br />
Well, overall, the fetish humor had its moments. I especially found it golden when they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36375">
        spoofed another classic of an anime during a pervert battle sequence. I know it&#039;s been parodied a hundred times before but I still liked it. And I chuckled when the mom and sister had their scenes. Other than that, most of the time it jumped back and forth between the boundary of funny/distasteful.<br />
<br />
What really brought the enjoyment down a level for me was that from beginning to end Taro made as much progress in his rehabilitation as a homosexual trying to turn straight. It&#039;s funny because that situation is the primary conflict in one of the episodes and yet I found it irritating instead of entertaining. <br />
<br />
I really believed from the first few episodes that there would be some honest character development for Sado and the others even with the mass amounts of bodily abuse and constant vulgarity. After sitting through half of the season, I realized it wasn&#039;t going anywhere in terms of plot advancement. How frustrating. As for romance, that portion sort of rubbed me in a familiar fashion. Not in a good way, however, because it&#039;s a formula that&#039;s been done and done better by other animes.<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#039;s not a memorable show. If you&#039;re strictly seeking potent perverted comedy and nothing else then I recommend you watch this. If you&#039;re not of the &quot;scum of the Earth&quot; or &quot;pig boy&quot; demographic than I beseech you to pass up MM! in light of something aimed at &quot;upstanding citizens of society&quot;... <br />
<br />
Just a joke. You&#039;re not scum. Don&#039;t hurt me.

    MM! Was an anime filled with romance, funny scenes, a good story, and some characters with some problems. I swear there wasn&#039;t one character without a problem like masochism or sadism. Anyway MM! Was a great anime in my opinion. This revolves around a highschool student named Tarou and he is a hardcore masochist. So one day his friend sends him to the second volunteering club at his school and Tarou explains his problem to the clubs president and she acts nice in the beginning but she breaks character and starts beating Tarou which to him being beaten by a pretty girl feels great to

        him. So, if you didn&#039;t notice she is a sadist and loves to hurt Tarou and she then pledges to rid him of his masochism.

    ~Multilingual review, English &amp; Español: MM!~<br />
<br />
Sadomasochism, Comedy and Romance are the keywords for this series. Considering the bad times I had with similar series featuring these same themes, I would actually say this was a show I should have definitely passed, even if everyone tells me that I shouldn&#039;t judge a book by its cover I&#039;m not able to don’t give a first impression to something I haven&#039;t seen yet, I can&#039;t be helped. But since I&#039;m a baka that doesn&#039;t learn from his previous errors I started this show anyway. Oh boy I did good...<br />
<br />
In my opinion a successful romance doesn&#039;t resides only in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168453">
        its girls, since also the guy must be likeable, cool and funny. Many romances just focus on its girls leaving the guy with just a plain, lame and cliché setting, thinking that only the girls are the soul of the show. That actually might be true, in part, because as always the main attractions are girls but I can&#039;t stop thinking if maybe am I the only one that think that a group of good girls liking a lame, boring and over cliché guy just feels just too wrong, I really hope I&#039;m not alone in that. Even if our protagonist, Sado Taro, might fall into a bit of cliché traits, he manages to be everything, a cool, likeable and funny character either way, as well as our female leads, so even if a bit cliché, the characters result charming and likeable, is there anything wrong in that?<br />
<br />
Sado Taro happens to be masochist, a completely hardcore pervert. He spend his miserable life between boring school lessons in the morning and a part-time job in a mini market in the afternoons, in all his misery the only spark in life is Shiori, a beautiful maiden that often goes to that mini market Taro works. His misery doesn&#039;t end after the job&#039;s schedule, as soon as he arrives home there&#039;s his older sister and mother that tortures him with their &#039;incestuous&#039; love. Ah poor Taro!, no one understands him, all he wants is a pretty girl that kicks quite hard his ass, he question himself why this cruel world doesn&#039;t pleases him?, but after all, we know that a pervert doesn&#039;t have an easy life!. In order to express his love for Shiori, Taro decides to get cured from masochism and he revolves to the Second Voluntary Club, a club that&#039;s famous for helping the students with their problems.<br />
<br />
The event that triggered the beginning for a more, new, painful life was the suddenly interest that Shiori express for Taro, but it seems she doesn&#039;t have the courage to talk with him, so Taro takes the lead and affront her. It&#039;s revealed that Shiori is actually Hayama, Taro&#039;s best friend, cross dressed. After the initial shock, Taro accepts Hayama&#039;s secret, grieving that his first love revealed to be a boy. Second Voluntary Club&#039;s president, Mio Isurugi, a girl with a BIG god complex had not forgotten the request from Taro and she&#039;s determinate to cure him from his masochism. This is where the show truly starts, Taro&#039;s being cured by any means possible by Mio, in the Club there&#039;s also Arashiko Yuuno, an androphobic girl.<br />
<br />
The 3 main characters are Taro, our pervert protagonist, manages to be funny every time he have screen time, he&#039;s quite cool when the situation requires so that&#039;s probably the only and good point of him. The girl with an enormous god complex, Isurugi Mio, she&#039;s a sadistic tsundere, that&#039;s quite cliché but since the protagonist is a masochist then that&#039;s makes of them a really nice duo. She does everything to cure Sado but that often offer her a possibility to express her inner sadistic side. To close our equilateral triangle, because Sado doesn&#039;t have a preference, there&#039;s Arashiko Yuuno, the kind and cute girl but those probably aren’t her unique traits since she&#039;s a violent androphobic girl, through the show she revolves almost every of her attacks to Taro, to the fortune of this last one. If you&#039;re looking for original characters you won&#039;t find them here, our protagonists are cliche, I&#039;ll just throw it there, but it&#039;s how they determinate the evolvement of the anime what impressed and made me appreciate them.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a good contrasts between romance and comedy scenes, so it didn&#039;t feel off time or inappropriate never through the show, there was an excellent balance of them Rather than following a linear plot each episode offers a new plan to cure Taro and the consequences that derives from it. Very clever and original plans I must say, and thankfully, quite funny.<br />
<br />
The art was quite nice, I really liked the character&#039;s design, they were detailed whiteout being too flashy. The animation was good, nothing overwhelming or below average, anyway it didn&#039;t influence or determine at all in the enjoyment. The OSTs were nice even if a bit forgettable; anyway it fitted each moment in the series. The OP single was really nice, both versions of it, Heaven and Hell. A really nice cast did the voices, Fukuyama Jun, Taketatsu Ayana and Hayami Saori, their voices fitted perfectly the personality of the characters.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed very much while watching this show. Definitely judging by only the cover, synopsis or wherever it’s not the right thing to do, anyway if you&#039;re a baka like me then you shouldn&#039;t have problems skipping a win show like this. To those who aren&#039;t, just give it a try, the comedy is awesome.<br />

~Multilingual review, English &amp; Español: MM!~<br />
<br />
Sadomasoquismo, Comedia y Romance son las palabras claves de esta serie. Considerando la malas experiencias que he tendido con series similares, con temas similares, hubiera dicho seguramente que esta era una serie que debería pasar de alto, aunque sí todo el mundo me repite que no debería juzgar sólo por la portada no soy capaz de no dar una primera impresión, mala o buena que sea, sobre algo que siquiera he visto, no tengo remedio. Pero si como soy un baka que no aprende de sus errores, inicie de todo modos esa serie. Eh si, hice bien..<br />
<br />
En mi opinión un buen romance no se basa sólo en las heroínas, porque también el protagonista debería ser agradable, cool y divertido. Muchos romances se enfocan solo en las chicas dejando al chico con un arquetipo bastante aburrido, simple y cliché, pensando que el corazón de la serie son las heroínas. Algo que no es completamente errado, porque como siempre, la atracción principal es la chica, pero no puedo dejar de pensar que si soy el único al que le parece que un grupo de chicas que guste de un pendejo súper cliché y sin personalidad sea algo completamente estúpido, estoy seguro que no soy el único. Aunque sí nuestro protagonista, Sado Taro, caiga un poco en lo que consideramos cliché, se demuestra ser un personaje agradable, simpático y sobre todo, divertido, al igual modo que nuestras heroínas, cliché pero simpáticos y agradables, que hay de malo en eso?<br />
<br />
Sado Taro es un masoquista, un completo pervertido. El pasa su miserable existencia entre las aburridas clases en la mañana y su trabajo de medio tiempo en un mini market en las tardes, en toda su miseria hay una sola luz en su vida, Shiori, una bella chica que suele ir de compras al mini donde trabaja Taro. Su miseria no termina después del horario de trabajo, apenas llega a casa, lo que le espera son su hermana y su madre que lo fastidian continuamente con su &quot;amor&quot;. Oh pobre Taro!, nadie lo comprende, todo lo que quiere es que una bella chica le pateé el culo, se pregunta a el mismo que porque este mundo cruel no lo satisface, pero como todos sabemos, un pervertido no tiene una vida fácil!. Para poder expresar su amor por Shiori, Taro decide de buscar ayuda, y la encuentra en el Segundo Club de Voluntarios, un club que es famoso por ayudar estudiantes a lidiar con sus problemas personales.<br />

El evento que da inició a una nueva vida, más miserable, para Taro, es el repentino interés de Shiori hacia el, pero la chica no tiene el coraje suficiente para dirigirle palabra, entonces Taro decide de enfrentarla. Se da a conocer que Shiori no es nadie más que Hayama, su mejor y único amigo, después de un shock inicial decide de aceptar este lado secreto de el, al mismo tiempo, maldiciendo porque su primer amor fue un hombre. Es aquí donde entra Mio Isurugi, presidente del Segundo Club de Voluntarios, una chica con un ENORME complejo de dios, la cual no ha olvidado el pedido de Taro de liberarlo de su masoquismo, comienza la nueva vida de Taro a merced de los planes de Mio para &quot;ayudarlo&quot;, junto a ellos hace parte también del club una chica androphobica, Arashiko Yuuno. El trío se revela ser muy divertido y capaz de coordinar una buena comedia.<br />
<br />
Nuestros tres personajes principales son, Taro, nuestro pervertido protagonista, el cual logra ser divertido cada vez que aparece, el es admirable cuando la situación lo requiere, su única y sola buena cualidad. La chica con el complejo de dios, Mio, ella es una sádica tsundere, algo cliché pero desde que el protagonista es un masoquista, eso los hace una buena y divertida pareja. Ella hace de todo para curar a Taro de su perversión, lo cual a veces le ofrece ocasión de dar desfogo a su lado sádico. A cerrar este triángulo equilátero, porque Taro no tiene preferencia alguna, esta Arashiko Yuuno, la chica dulce y gentil, pero esas no son seguramente sus únicas cualidades, desde que ella es una chica súper violenta debido su fobia hacia los hombres, violencias dirigidas exclusivamente hacia Taro, para la suerte de este último. Si estas buscando personajes originales no los vas a encontrar aquí, lo diré claramente, pero fue como estos personajes determinaron los eventos sucedidos en la serie que me hicieron apreciarlos tanto.<br />
<br />
La serie presenta un buen contraste entre el romance y las escenas cómicas, así que no se sintieron fuera de lugar o inapropiadas en ningún momento, excelente balance de ambas. La serie no sigue un desarrollo linear, más bien presenta un formato episódico que ofrece siempre un nuevo plan de Mio para curar a Taro y las consecuencias que derivan de el. Planes que resultan brillantes y originales, y por suerte, también divertidos.<br />
<br />
El arte estuvo bastante bien, me gustaron mucho el diseño de los personajes, fueron detallados sin ser muy sobresalientes. La animación fue buena, nada fuera de lo normal o por debajo, de todos modos no determina o influye para nada en el disfrute. El reparto musical, las OSTs, no fueron únicas, a decir verdad algo fácilmente olvidables pero justas para cada momento y escenario durante la serie. El OP single estuvo bastante bueno, ambas versiones de la canción, Heaven y Hell. Un cast de Seiyuus de verdad experto hicieron las voces, Fukuyama Yun, Taketatsu Ayana y Hayami Saori, sus voces eran perfectamente en sintonía con los personajes.<br />
<br />
A mi personalmente me divirtió mucho este anime. Juzgar solamente por la portada, por la sinopsis, o lo que sea no es la cosa justa de hacer, de todos modos si eres un baka como yo, entonces no hay riesgos de que te pierdas un anime tan bueno como este, pero si no lo eres, dale una oportunidad, la comedia es simplemente genial.

    I usually hate when people write reviews judging by the first few episodes, but I think by now I have a pretty good grasp on it.<br />
This is also my first review so bare with me, please.<br />
<br />
Story 9: The story is about Sado Tarou who is a &quot;hard core sexual masochism&quot;; someone who has pleasure in getting hurt. To cure his problem he visits the Voluntary Club, a place where they &quot;grant your wishes&quot;. There, everyday, they try to &quot;torture&quot; him out of his masochism. He ends up joining the club with Mio Isurugi, Yuno Arashiko, and Michiru Onigawara. There he &quot;encounters&quot; more adventures into their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31414">
        lives (though I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s the write choice of words...)<br />
<br />
Art 9: I&#039;m a fan of the &quot;big eyed-moe&quot; art, so sorry if this also comes up a bit bias. Very colorful, and &#039;cute&#039;. Not much to say about the art, it pretty much follows into the current style of anime these days (if you notice it&#039;s kind of changing).<br />
<br />
Sound 7: Nothing much about the sound, it&#039;s just average? I really like the opening sound, the ending is okay, but that&#039;s just me. I&#039;ll leave the sound up to yourself.<br />
<br />
Character 10: The characters is the best part. We have Mio Isurugi, or &quot;God&quot;, one of the main characters. She is the heroin, a sadist and tsundere. (in my opinion is a great combination, since I love tsundere anyways haha;;) She and Michiru are the main people who try to help cure Sado. Her best friend is Yuno. She has a soft spot for her friends, and usually does nothing more than to help them. She often gets dressed up in clothes because Michiru makes her.<br />
Sado Taro, the one with masochism, Mio always refers to &quot;M! Pervert&quot;. He, as well, will do almost anything for his friends. In middle school, he had been apparently been abused by a girl, who is at fault for turning him into a masochism. He gets abused every day by the Voluntary Club, to try to cure him. At home, he has a mom and a sister, who are obsessed with loving him. He works part-time at a convenience store. His best friend is Hayama Tatukichi, who seemed to be just about the only one who accepted him as a masochist.<br />
Yuno Arashiko is another &quot;moe-fragual-big-breasted-girl&quot; but, there&#039;s more to her than that. She is androphobic; a phobia towards men. By her past, you can tell she can stick through just about anything that you throw at her. She also joined the second Voluntary Club to help cure herself. Her best friend is Yumi Mamiya and Mio. Her dog&#039;s name was Taro, so to try to cure her phobia, she calls Taro her &quot;dog&quot;, which is another strategy to help cure her phobia of men.<br />
Michiru Onigawara is the schools nurse, and the second Voluntary Club&#039;s adviser. She enjoys dressing up Mio and taking pictures of &quot;cute girls&quot;.<br />
(that&#039;s all I&#039;ll do for now since there&#039;s not enough information on the other characters yet....look forward to another review!)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10: Sorry if this review came off as a bit bias. I love this! Most ecchis are focused on ecchi only, but the characters and Story line pull it together to make it over all a great watch. Very funny most of the time, drama is smooth and makes sense. Overall, I&#039;m going to give it a 10. :D

    Konichiwa, mina-san, this is akinari-kun from SUTORAIKUanime, here to bring you my first impression of MM!.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-the truth is, I&#039;m a masochist! I get pleasure when women abuse me. It feels so good that I lose myself! I&#039;m tellin&#039; ya it gets really bad! What do I do!? I cannot control myself at all!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
 And there you have it, the outline of Tarou Sado, a high school freshman with a sexual masochism fetish, or whatever the hell you call it. Whatever it is, it&#039;s funny, it&#039;s catchy, and it makes Mio look absolutely sexy.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s how the first episode of comedy romance &quot;MM!&quot; started. Along comes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31004">
        the OP, &quot;Help!&quot; by Ayana Taketatsu, with a catchy beat and suitable lyrics. I found it a little interesting that there hasn&#039;t been any pantsu flashes yet, not that it matters, but it&#039;s just there have been so many camera angles that refer to pantsu, but no pantsu are to be seen, strange...anywho, based on the OP, it is implied that this series is a harem, with all the kawaii desu girls and what not, but who knows, I&#039;m just making an educated guess.<br />
<br />
Here we have the same guys who brought us Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers (notice the animation similarities), XEBEC and AT-X. However, the character designer and directors are different, therefore the slight difference in animation, which I actually think looks even better than Kanokon and Ladies versus Butlers. First thing&#039;s first, I absolutely loved the character designs of both Kanokon and LvB, so I don&#039;t see why I wouldn&#039;t feel the same way about MM!. It&#039;s only the first episode and I&#039;m already in love with the character designs AND their personalities. <br />
<br />
Basically the entire episode we are shown Tarou being tortured, kicked, slapped, tied, being hit by baseballs, etc. while he laughs hysterically and enjoys it all. I find this quite hilarious, and the fact that Mio is trying to cure his masochism by hurting him even more just elevates the humour of the storyline to a whole new level. But Mio isn&#039;t the only person that is involved with the torturing of Tarou...cue Yuuno Arashiko, a cute purple haired girl who finds Tarou absolutely disgusting (and also doesn&#039;t mind giving him a good beating).<br />
<br />
Seems like everything has happened in just one episode, even Tarou&#039;s sister Shizuka has a brother complex (yaay for brother complex!), and Tarou&#039;s mother has a son complex (err...yaay for son complex? Hmm...)! And what&#039;s even more amazing is that...IS THAT...AHHHHHHH I&#039;m itching to say it, but I won&#039;t spoil the most epic scene of the first episode for anyone.<br />
<br />
Well, that wraps up my first impression of &quot;MM!&quot;, I must say, I didn&#039;t expect much from this series, but I got quite a pleasant surprise and a huge load of hilarious laughs out of it, so I&#039;m going to continue covering this series. And I&#039;m quite grateful that Ryuumaru subbed it so fast, since I just happened to have a lot of time on my hands today.<br />
<br />
And, last but not least, COULD MIO BE A TSUNDERE!? <br />
<br />
That&#039;s all for now, happy watching, mina! Join us next week as we cover the second episode of &quot;MM!&quot;

    Believe me. I was skeptical at first. A show about a masochist? Hah! Probably it&#039;s just gonna be centered around hundreds of repetitive slapstick jokes. Turns out to be true. But hold on! Mr Masochist here has his own harem? What?! How can a masochist has his own harem when us normal people out here are trying so hard to get one! He&#039;s not even that good looking...<br />
<br />
Turns out like every male harem lead, all you have to do is be nice and overflowing girls will come after you. Now, this isn&#039;t realistic of course because guys like us aren&#039;t nice. Chances is if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33113">
        have your harem right now, its probably because you&#039;re loaded with good looks and money. (More towards the money department)<br />
<br />
Story 6/10<br />
There&#039;s not much of a story here. Don&#039;t expect much of a plot development as I may remind you this is a harem anime. However I was expecting the story to revolve around other &quot;unique&quot; characters but the only thing you&#039;re getting is masochist mayhem. Nevertheless I do enjoy seeing them trying out new ways to cure his masochism (and inevitably failing)<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
Wow! Everything look so bright and new! Such a cheerful image is portrayed in every episode. You wouldn&#039;t expect this much since the story is about a masochist. Shouldn&#039;t it be very.. I don&#039;t know how to describe it... Urrm.. Masochistic? <br />
Anyways, if you&#039;re looking for a bright and cheerful type of anime and you&#039;re not a lolicon, then look no further!<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
Ok.. I gotta to be frank here. I&#039;m amazed at the Sado&#039;s seiyuu&#039;s constant orgasmic sound he makes when he gets screwed. And to couple with that masochistic bliss is a heavenly themed sound effect. I mean if your mum was to walk into your room while Sado is moaning in lust, she would think that you&#039;re watching porn!<br />
Other than that, I love the individuality theme song each character gets when they make an entrance. Especially Noa&#039;s. I mean, how can you not like the sound of xylophones! It portrays Noa perfectly as a kid!<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
When I started watching this, I thought to myself, &quot;Wow, an anime about every characters having some sort of psychological disorder! This is going to be interesting!&quot;<br />
Yeah I know, doesn&#039;t take a lot to interest me.<br />
But hey he has a harem! Let&#039;s take a look into that shall we.<br />
OK so we got a Tsundere girl with a superior complexity and doesn&#039;t know how to cook, a big b**b girl who&#039;s afraid of men, we got a loli character, and some incestuous family members. (Geez what&#039;s wrong with the Autumn line up and all it&#039;s incest shows)<br />
Ok looks like he has everything a typical &quot;Chaotic&quot; type harem needs.<br />
Other than that, male harem leads are suppose to have pervertic best friends. Well this one cross dress so I don&#039;t know how much pervertic can you get other than that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 7/10<br />
Hey, it&#039;s something new. You never heard an anime about a masochist before. Could be entertaining. And they added a bunch of DBZ parodies. Wow! That is until they run the joke dry. Well I hoped that each girl was given their personal arc with Sado but nope, it&#039;s mostly revolved around Mio and Yuuno. Still it is entertaining to see dense male harem leads getting beaten up. I mean, I would like to do it myself but seeing Sado won&#039;t get turn on getting beaten up by a guy.<br />
And aside from DBZ superpowers, Sado do have one power that I insist all male harem lead should have. A twisted taste bud. One of the positive side about being a masochist is that you actualy ENJOY eating badly cooked food (A common anime troope for certain anime girls)<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
Conclusion this anime is pretty unique in its own way but solely meant for entertainment only. Like many harem anime, do not expect a conclusion, I mean most of the time it&#039;s because the male leads are too dense. The slapstick comedy can get old really quick. But dont worry, like many modern day animes, fanservice is thrown in to momentarily grab our attention as usual. Nevertheless you would still enjoy the different variety of characters they have to offer.<br />
<br />
Haremu Kingu,<br />

    This was one of those anime&#039;s where i just stumbled across it on anime freak and was not expecting the madness that it was about to throw at me. this was just Mad, Mad, Mad all the way through and i loved it. <br />
<br />
The main reason i liked this anime was the three main characters (Taro Sado, Mio Isurugi and Arashiko Yuno) who all have their, lets say difficulty&#039;s in life at school. I love this trio of misfits. the art style of the game is great and so is the sound, especially when there is a dragon ball Z reference in the anime and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review132511">
        it just made me relive my childhood.  <br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m not saying that this anime is perfect, there are one or two things that I wasn&#039;t that keen on. there was a bit of a story, but it didn&#039;t feel interesting, it was mostly just scenario after scenario which was enjoyable, i just wanted more of a story. Also that it just sort off ends and is slightly disappointing as i wish there were more episodes. <br />
<br />
All in all i loved the characters and art style, just wish that the story was more of a story. However i would buy this with money, so let me know what you think of it.

    Since I mostly watch romance and harem animes, I figured why not give this a try. While reading through the story, I thought it wasn&#039;t going to be good. I thought it was one of those echhi anime with a lot of fan service, but then the word &quot;masochist&quot; caught my eye. Then, I didn&#039;t know what a masochist was, so I decided to look it up. I was so shocked the male protagonist is a lot like me, since i didn&#039;t know that I was a masochist. So I decided to watch the first episode to know if I was going to continue watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review52317">
        the series, I was really shocked, I was impressed and amazed. The art was good, the characters make me so lol. Though in the ending of the first episode, I felt like there was a huge possibility it was to become a yaoi anime. But overall it&#039;s an 8 out of 10 for me. <br />
(I did enjoy it very much, not only in the first episode, but in the latter episodes as well. I felt sad after watching the last episode, because I had to let this anime go(due to this being a good anime), I felt sad partly because Akinari Matsuno died, therefore no way in hell there would be a second season. :(  ) <br />
P.S. I&#039;m still new to making reviews, so please feel free to comment on what i did wrong.

    &#039;MM!&#039; is a slapstick comedy about a high school student who&#039;s masochist to the core.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
The story starts with Sado Tarou visiting Volunteer Club #2 to get his masochist nature fixed. He was immediately dubbed &quot;Butarou&quot; (pig bastard), and obviously a poor plan of fixing him through extreme pain was devised, and he gets to enjoy the masochism play everyday. Beyond that, there isn&#039;t really a story to this show, but this series is a hardcore slapstick, so a real story isn&#039;t needed nor desired. It focuses on the comedy and perversion of the protagonist as he gets into all sorts of strange situations that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32853">
        made &#039;MM!&#039; a very enjoyable show.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Not many protagonists are so openly M and enjoys BDSM as much as Butarou. Having such a perverted and out of ordinary protagonist alone was a fresh breeze of originality that made this show hilarious. Pretty much all the girls around him are sadists who beat the crap out of Butarou, and become attracted to him. All the support characters were cardboard cutouts, but they managed to gather all the the stereotypical harems girls: Obvious tsundere; androphobic attacker; loli prodigy; jealous masseur, and a hot teacher to put Butarou into all sorts of difficult situations. Character development is once again very limited, but not really required.<br />
<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
Same faces, big eyes, all sorts of hair colors... it&#039;s your typical anime character design, but the Sado Tarou&#039;s hentai form is pretty funny, and all the girls are pretty attractive. Lots of fan service as well. Very vibrant colors and heavy glossy filter was used, and visually pleasing.<br />
Very good camera work and angles, it&#039;s the type of animation that you don&#039;t get tired of just by watching the video.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Voice acting was done pretty well, distinct voices for the protagonist and two main heroines. Taketatsu Ayana as Mio was identical to what she did with Kirino in Oreimo, but suited the character really well. Especially when she verbally abuses Tarou.<br />
OP/ED were typical otagei anime songs, but the labeling of S/M for producers was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
Although this show is very technically flawed, I enjoyed it a lot. Not many shows are as daring in exploiting fetishes as &#039;MM!&#039;. The absurd situations like bondage in high school club room, memory loss, hypnosis etc were hilarious, and there was a lot of fan service as well as verbal and physical abuse. What this show really excelled was the energy and pacing. As far as slapstick comedy goes, this is among the best.

    At first glance I expected it to be the crappy ecchi comedy of the season, and it pretty much was. Yet, despite the episodic nature and lack of progression I had a lot of hope.<br />
Expectation: 6-7<br />
Episode scores: -,-,-,-, 4, 7, 4, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10<br />
Actual: 5 (Average)<br />
<br />
There was many episodes where I was stunned by the romance, and the quality of some of the jokes; I of course have always been a sucker for the pseudo date episodes, and this show played that card heavily. The only time scenes which truly bored me were the handful of long masochistic scenes.<br />
<br />
 Yes, a lot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33432">
        the time is spent beating up Sado in cosplay. While a little of this is fine the span of time wasted on these types of scenes was overdoing things. The story revolves around his masochistic personality, but they should of at least weaved it into an actually interest story at times.<br />
<br />
On top of this the level of randomness and variety was also overbearing. After the first few were rather good and had a believable serious tone, all of a sudden people are pulling of dragonball parodies based on the power of prevertedness. While it was not all that bad i was somewhat surprised with what i was seeing. <br />
<br />
There is no character development either, and they are all pretty one dimensional; nothing more than there single oddity. While i liked some of them i can not admit that any were actually interest characters. The caveat is that this is a comedy as well so I was not expecting much.<br />
  <br />
It was not a bad watch, and at times extremely amusing. However, an entire episode is either hit or miss; there is not really divided segments which i find allows me, in comedies, to at least enjoy one part. Due to this inconsistancy i can&#039;t say it was anything more than average.

    NOTE: This anime was DROPPED by me, and as such the following review will only take into account things I actually saw during the short time I watched the series.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: The following review is based on my personal opinions, and does not feature many objective analyses. As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In a lot of anime, we see lots of perverts, or weird fetishes amongst some people, and this all serves to make them who they are as a character (in most cases), but what if an anime would focus almost solely on one pervert, and his fetish,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102261">
        or rather his quest to get rid of his perversion?<br />
<br />
That could be a pretty funny series (especially in the case of a masochist) if done right, but unfortunately, I don’t feel like MM! succeeded.<br />
<br />
Story: (3 / 10)<br />
<br />
So we have our MC, Sado Taro - masochist, who wants to get rid of this perversion of his. To do this, he seeks the help of a special club at his school, devoted to helping people with their problems. Enter Isurugi, a sadist with god-complex.<br />
<br />
Now, how is this sadist going to help this masochist get rid of his perversion? Well, the obvious thing is to... Torture... him...<br />
<br />
Basically, the entire series is about Sado being tortured and beaten in various ways, to cure him of his perversion, with some romantic sub-plot (at least in the first couple of episodes), and the rest of the time it’d just be about Sado’s daily life as a sadist.<br />
<br />
Art: (7 / 10)<br />
<br />
The animation quality and character designs are actually pretty good, to be honest. While not anything fantastic, the backgrounds make for a nice setting, and the characters are detailed enough to not make you think of them as just paint on a background.<br />
<br />
As expected from an ecchi show, it also has quite the amount of fanservice. Ofcourse, if you like that stuff, then by all means...<br />
<br />
Sound: (6 / 10)<br />
<br />
2 episodes isn’t really much to judge the sound quality by, but I did actually continue to listen to the first OP &amp; ED songs. The OP, “HELP!! -Hell Side-”, really helps set the mood for the series, in a way. The ED is also quite the cute song, and overall I don’t really think there’s any big flaws in the sound department.<br />
<br />
Character: (5 / 10)<br />
<br />
Personally, I found most of the characters kinda dumb, or at least the way they behave. Yes, I understand they’re all this way for the comedic purposes of the show, but still...<br />
<br />
Basically, the cast consist of: (as far as episode 2 goes)<br />
<br />
Sado - The masochist.<br />
<br />
Isurugi - Sadist with god-complex.<br />
<br />
Yuuno - The reason for Sado’s masochism, and has a fear of men.<br />
<br />
Hayama - Sado’s best friend, and avid crossdresser.<br />
<br />
Mostly ignoring Hayama, all character interactions are pretty much predictable, regarding the first 3 characters. A sadist and a masochist would obviously result in a “funny” scene where she beats him, he likes it, so then she beats him some more.<br />
<br />
A man trying to interact with a girl with a fear of men would result in the girl being freaked out, probably hurting the man, and running away.<br />
<br />
Because of some of the stupid choices some of the characters keep making, it all feels very forced and makes it hard to like, or care about certain characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (3 / 10)<br />
<br />
Really, I’m not the type of person to drop anime this easily, but man, I just couldn’t take it with this one. The entire time during these first two episodes (mind you, that’s almost 40 minutes), was spent repeating the same type of scene for comedic purpose, with some attempts at making a story fit in among the chaos.<br />
<br />
To be honest, it just all felt pretty forced, and was all rather annoying.<br />
<br />
Then again, if you find this type of stuff funny, and don’t mind repetitiveness, then boy, is this show for you!<br />
<br />
Personally though, I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole...<br />
<br />

    It´s original but a little complicated to enjoy, if I think to much about it it´s lame, but it can make youu have some laughts...<br />
<br />
Te story isn&#039;t a big deal but the art is REALLY good. If you see it without thinking about the morality and stuff, it&#039;s OK, but not recomendable if you think bad of MM, SS or the kind.  Not Hard-Ecchi but enough to make the series funny.

    This anime is a decent way to spend time if you&#039;re sick in bed all day; I don&#039;t mean that as an insult.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story&#039;s pretty decent for the first few episodes, then it pretty much gets dropped.  The show becomes focused on random events between the characters, the final episode coming out of no where completely in terms of plot relevance.  On the plus side, it isn&#039;t hard to follow, easy to digest, and would be a good choice if you watched an anime that recently blew you away.  Treat this show like a Saturday morning cartoon.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is pretty average, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46265">
        in a good way.  The scenery is vibrant, the characters look distinguished, the ecchi is appealing and well censored. Very colorful and eye catching.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
To be honest I watched this show today and I don&#039;t remember anything about the sound.  I&#039;m a musician so I automatically catch on to something if it peaks my interest.  Nothing here.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Characters are Okay.  There&#039;s some good development and some mannerisms they get stuck on the entire series (which gets annoying for me at least).  The personalities for each of the characters are nice though, a fun cast over all.  I found it easy to match characters with their names, I usually have trouble with this.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall<br />
It was a good way for me to spend my sick day, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for anyone looking for something life changing.  It&#039;s a good filler anime for between deep series.<br />
<br />

    This is one of the funniest animes you will come across that isnt like many others. The plot is hilarious and it confidently fullfills its job as being a comedy, harem and romance. <br />
<br />
Story 9<br />
If you havnt read the synopsis yet MM! revolves around Taro Sado not your average male lead seeing as he is a masochist ( a person who finds sexual pleasure from feeling pain or humiliation) and your average 2 female leads who both have feelings for Taro. The storyline consist of following these characcters and how their relationships with each other differ while trying to cure Taro of his masochism hehehe.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review37954">
        For a harem the story is one that many have come across before, nothing fresh but its the way that they incorporate the story and the backgrounds of each character together that makes this anime one that you will not regret seeing.<br />
<br />
Art 10<br />
&quot;wow really a 10 I doubt it&quot; is what most people would think of my scoring but for being a relatively &#039;new&#039; anime being released in mid 2010 its animation is top notch. The colours used are so vibrant and the quality put into each character is obvious. <br />
<br />
Sound 8<br />
At first as with many animes the op for the series felt a bit....blah. After the first 3 episodes i went up to my mirror and slapped myself. The op song is very energetic and catchy it is one i now have on my playlist :D. The ending as well is one you should spend 1 extra minute to enjoy as with the op it is very catchy and one you will bound to be listening over and over. Apart from that the music used throughout the anime all compliment the scene and make it trully beautifull.<br />
<br />
Character 9<br />
THe main male lead Taro will be one of my favourite characters of all time just because of how funny he is in a unintentional way. The female leads personalities differ so viewers can choose which is their favourite. Mio Isurugi is an extreme tsundere. She feels a certain responsibility to help Taro cure his disease and does it in the funniest of ways. Arashiko Yuno is the nice and romantic one.....at times. She too has a disease many anime viewers are aware of, androphobia the fear of males.With this bonus in the anime Taro recieves pain from left and right whether it be on purpose or accidental. The charcters development is good considering how the anime is only 12 episodes long.<br />
<br />
Enjoymet 9<br />
This anime is one that i will never forget it has to be one of the funniest animes I have seen. Every episode made me laugh so hard. THe thing about MM! is that although it has some plain aspects it somehow utilizes these and makes it enjoyable to see. Wathing how Taro gets tortured physically might seem sort of funny but its the fact he loves the pain and wants more yet at the same time he finds it a curse is just hilarious. <br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
This was a once in a lifetime anime and the twists and turns in MM! is one that will keep you wanting more. I enjoy romance ainime and even thought it isnt solely based around romance it makes up for this is the comedy. IF you are a romance or comedy fan that dosent mind the usual harem I defininetely recommend this too you. ENJOY!!!<br />

    I originally watched the first few episodes around a year ago and instantly dropped it. This was because I just got into the whole romance/harem/comedy genre of animes and I was looking for something more &quot;romance&quot; heavy and more &quot;harem&quot; based in the sense that all the girls wanted the main characters *you know what* right off the bat.<br />
<br />
So judging off that idea MM! was a strict no no and I never looked at it again.<br />
<br />
However a few days ago, seeing how there is literally NO good romcom/harems that I haven&#039;t seen (at least good by my standards) I was like f*ck it, watching MM!.<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53933">
        was completely blown away. MM! is an amazing series and usually I am too lazy to write reviews (I&#039;ve only written a handful of reviews for the select few animes that really touched my these past 1-2 years).<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
In my eyes  the story was very nice. You have a masochist protagonist who was shunned his whole school life because of his past tendencies of being a &quot;pervert&quot; or &quot;freak&quot; whenever he would get a M orgasm. He now seeks help from a club who is known for helping those in need. On top of that you find out about the problems of his friends and club members that all add on to the hilarity and cuteness of the series. It really meshes together very nicely. Especially the touching moments who Tarou defends the girls and brings out his manly side.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10: The colors are very vibrant and nice. I tend to like the same kinds of artwork that are similar to the ones found in MM! (such as Sora No Otoshimono or Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari). They might not have the same art STYLE but the vibrant colors and the depth of the artwork is what I am talking about. The visuals are very pleasing. I recommend watching them in the highest quality you can find since it makes every anime in my opinion a lot better and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10: The OP isn&#039;t my favourite BUT that does not mean it is not enjoyable. It wasn&#039;t as catchy as Isekai No Seikishi&#039;s OP (which is a masterpiece in my eyes) or even Mirai Nikki&#039;s first OP BUTTTTTT it is very VERY nice. If I was trapped in a room and had to watch MM! all over again but I could not skip the OP I would not mind one bit. It&#039;s very cute and catchy. It&#039;s just not the heart wrenching style that I tend to like.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10: The characters were great. They all brought something to the table. M male protagonist, his S counterpart female protagonist, androphobic club member that originally hated him for being a pervert but ended up falling in love with him, cross dressing best friend, jealous lesbian childhood friend of one of the girls who likes him, and the loli genius. Very good cast, and the voices were great too.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: very funny romCom and I highly recommend it to anyone who dropped it and those who are thinking of watching it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s really worth another look. I really enjoyed it these past few days. I was really happy to see that there are MM! specials but I was disheartened to find out that they are only 1 min long :(((( I need something more substantial<br />
<br />
Oh well. It was a great series. Now I&#039;m sad that I have to rummage through MAL AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SERIES TO WATCH. I honestly hate doing this every time. I finish a good series and then I have to find ANOTHER series to match it/beat it -____- so sad

    MM! is the harrowing story of a man plagued by masochism who attempts to overcome his love of pain through the help of a girl two years older who runs a club that grants wishes. Together with this lovely female companion he embarks on an epic quest through the streets of Tokyo in an attempt to cure himself. Along the way he meets a girl who has a severe dislike for men and hits any man who touches her and they fall in love. It both touches your heart and warms your body with its realistic portrayals of masochism, androphobia, and human relationships.<br />
<br />
No, I’m just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188529">
        screwing with you. You can only wish for an anime that good when watching this giant pile of mediocre donkey droppings. You may notice how lately I’ve been reviewing romantic comedies in the small hope I’ll find something with a decent romance, funny comedy, and likeable characters. But I’ve been failing miserably.<br />
<br />
MM! is a typically boring, rarely funny, and overly cliché anime with one redeeming characteristic. It’s kind of like Baka and Test, but not the funny first season. More like the drab, underwhelming second season.<br />
<br />
MM! has a fairly basic make-up. A guy named Tarou Sado (Teeheehee, sadomasochism) is a total masochist and gets off to when girls beat him up and violently attempt to kill him. To cure this he goes to the Second Volunteer Club where he meets a tiny, feisty girl named Mio Isurugi. He also reacquaints himself with the girl who originally started his masochistic ways, Arashiko Yuuno. She has androphobia and beats on men who touch her, due to a near rape by a male student in her middle school years. I likened her to Lisbeth Salander, though a much, much, much more shallow version. There’s also a cross dressing friend and a loli inventor girl with no friends. But that’s not too important.<br />
<br />
What’s more important is how Mio goes about attempting to cure Tarou’s masochism. This is the major problem with the whole show for me. We see that Tarou, unlike real people, does not have a limit to how much pain he can take. He enjoys his genitals being thoroughly destroyed, he enjoys his face getting rearranged, he enjoys eating bad food made by a girl. This guy must be like Superman or something, because he takes more pain than anyone should possibly be able to. And Mio doesn’t appear to understand that he likes it, and I guess she thinks she will eventually get him to reach a limit or something? She continually beats him and does terrible things to him but he enjoys it all. So it’s not working, maybe you should try something else?<br />
<br />
I mean, she does. We have the classic hypnotism episode that goes in directions I wish it hadn’t. Maybe I’m just not used to crossdressing/gay humor. But I didn’t find it funny as much as I did disturbing.<br />
<br />
So is there really a story? Can I stop this long tirade here and quit with the complaining? NO! There are two rather random episodes. One introduces the obligatory loli character, Noa. She’s an inventor and has no friends. So, she decides to invent a machine that will turn everyone in the world into perverts.<br />
<br />
…<br />
….<br />
<br />
On top of that being idiotic and not even funny (maybe when I was fourteen I would have laughed my ass off but at this point in my life I find that to just be a lame excuse for a laugh) it turns into some sort of Kamen Rider/Dragon Ball Z referencing fight that is  ridiculous. I know it’s a cartoon, and I need to suspend my belief in reality, but it’s just so inconsistent with the rest of the show. The episode felt like it didn’t belong. It came out of nowhere, it did nothing but introduce our little inventor, and it wasn’t funny.<br />
<br />
The problem with pretty much every episode minus maybe two or three is that it has no far-reaching consequences, does nothing to progress the story or build the characters, and this isn’t a straight up comedy. We’ve seen before that you can mix a good plot with good characters and some comedy elements. The problem here is that whatever romance is developing is undefined. Especially toward the end when you wonder whether there is a love triangle going on or Tarou likes only one girl.<br />
<br />
I complained about this with Baka and Test and will do it here too. DEFINE THE ROMANCE! The last episode wasn’t even a good last episode, it felt like it belonged mid-way through the series. The episode before that was the only time anyone came out with their true feelings and Tarou forgets about it before he can act upon this. Thus, we’re left with what feels like an incomplete anime. Maybe they were expecting a second season?<br />
<br />
And yes, I know it’s based off of a light novel series. But the least that we can get is a clear ending. Just admitting feelings is all I ask. It is not a romantic comedy if there is not a romance developed and defined at the end.<br />
<br />
Now that I’ve raged over nothing, let’s talk about the animation.<br />
<br />
It’s good. Characters and backgrounds are colorful. I especially liked the girls school uniform, it was purty. As far as smoothness goes, it’s alright in that respect. Otherwise not much to complain about.<br />
<br />
Sound? Well, the opening is pretty bad. Never have I heard truer words in an opening theme song than “Oh my God is Jesus Christ”. Why do the Japanese try to speak English and fail miserably? It’s like the song from Clannad, just listening to the lyrics is laughable. I mean, they make more sense than the lyrics to a Red Hot Chili Peppers song, but are still awful. The ending song is not bad as much as mediocre. Music during the show is once again mediocre. Nothing that evokes emotions or you want to put on your iPod. Character’s voices are all lovely.<br />
<br />
And while on the subject of characters, they are all fairly underdeveloped and boring. Tarou is nothing more than an oblivious teenage guy with an issue that needs to be fixed. He doesn’t seem to have any emotions besides pleasure and fear, though sometimes he does exhibit some sentimentality that could have developed his character if there had been more moments like it. Mio is like a combination of Haruhi Suzumiya and Taiga Aisaka. She believes herself a god and is a feisty little high schooler. Yuuno is the only character of any worth, though not much. She has a defined background and a reason for being the way she is, and she is the only character that seems to exhibit any kind of emotions.<br />
<br />
All the minor characters fit their roles as either: A.)Useless or B.) Useless but for fan service. Michiru the photographer/nurse, Noa, Tarou’s mom and sister. They all seem to just be there for fan service and maybe to create some stupid plot device. One of these is the fact that Tarou’s mom and sister are fighting over Tarou because they both love him in a creepy way. Now, the sister thing I’ve kind of gotten used to, it seems to be used in comedies a lot. But the mom wanting to marry her own son? What? What about Tarou’s father? Maybe that could have used some explaining.<br />
<br />
The only character I found to be funny was Tarou’s manager at the convenience store. He loves his body pillow and at one point has an action figure he carries around and asks what he should buy. That was funny for some sort of psychotic reason. Otherwise, the characters are all cardboard cut outs and unexciting.<br />
<br />
I wanted to like MM!. I wanted to like Mio, who I found to be absolutely adorable. I wanted to laugh and revel in the sheer craziness. But I couldn’t. Or more precisely, I rarely could. MM! has so many conventional plot devices (club goes out to do something), characters (Mio, Noa), and settings (the obligatory beach and school festival episodes) that it just feels like it stitched together other anime in a caricature of what a romantic comedy should be.<br />
<br />
MM!’s only redeeming factor is that it has pretty animation.<br />
<br />
Overall, if I had the choice between ripping out my eyeballs with serrated spoons coated in poison while simultaneously being burned alive, and watching MM!, I’d probably tentatively choose watching MM!. But if I did not have to choose in such extreme circumstances, then I would not watch MM!. It’s mediocrity at its absolute finest.

    OK, so this anime is about sexual disorders, we have the main character, Taro Sado, who&#039;s a masochist. Mio Isurugi and her nurse elder sister, who are sadist, Yuno Arashiko who&#039;s  androphobic  ( somehow, I&#039;m beginning to think that she might be lesbian) and Tatsukich Hayama who&#039;s a cross dressing gay ( I wonder if she has any romantic feelings for Sado? EEEEEwwww). Anyway, I think that this anime should have been made as full encchi all the way instead of  a subtle one, that way it&#039;ll add more to the comedy. As for the other characters.....I guess we&#039;ll find out later

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31319">
        if what other sexual disorders do they have or is it just limited to these few individuals. Hummm, I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait and watch for the succeeding episode.
