    I have never seen any other anime that has had such a great impact on me, and I don&#039;t expect to find any either. Koi Kaze is simply outstanding in the way it handles this story, which is very much taboo in our society. <br />
<br />
First of all, Koi Kaze lacks all those annoying anime clich&amp;eacute;s that usually put me a bit off when watching a series. There are no girls who are supposed to be 15 but act like they are 10 and speak with the voice of a toy rabbit. Instead, we get a realistic portrayal of a teenage girl who actually acts naturally.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6729">
        Nanoka&#039;s voice actress does a brilliant job, she sounds natural, like she is acting with her own voice instead of making up a voice for the character. The character designs are also more realistic, with the characters looking a whole lot more like real people than most anime characters. Everything is kept serious and realistic in general. <br />
<br />
Koi Kaze is not a noisy or action-filled series, but it&#039;s never dull either. As the story progresses, the viewer will sympathize with both of the two main characters, even though they in no way are perfect. They are two people, brother and sister (and the brother is significantly older as well), who are gradually falling love, and they can&#039;t help it. It&#039;s difficult, even painful, to watch, and it does make you think about what is to be considered &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;. Before watching this I thought the concept to be clearly on the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; side, but after watching it I concluded that I&#039;m actually in no position to write off a relationship as such. <br />
<br />
The music is also worth mentioning. It&#039;s not loud or dramatic, but rather simple and effective. There are a few beautiful piano pieces playing that do a very good job in setting the mood. The music never takes the focus off the story, but complements it very well.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a series I would recommend to anyone, heck, it might the single series I would strongly recommend even to those who don&#039;t normally watch anime. It&#039;s been a good while since I watched it, but the story never left me and it makes me want to come back and re-experience it. With absolutely no traditional melodrama or &amp;quot;in your face&amp;quot; symbolism whatsoever, Koi Kaze manages to touch, to shock and to offer something new to the viewer, and it&#039;s a story you just don&#039;t forget. It&#039;s that good.

    Amongst all the adrenaline-pumping action, zany comedy, melodrama, and over-the-top lunacy of anime, there are a rare few series that go out of their to seriously deal with sensitive issues. Koi Kaze is one such series. It is a gentle, honest, and ultimately heart-breaking story that deals with an issue most other shows would avoid (or in the case off anime, play of as a joke). Needless to say the exploration of taboo is not something everyone enjoys. However, Koi Kaze explores its issue with a maturity and truthfulness that makes it a true gem.<br />
<br />
The issue in question is incest (with a large age difference

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39234">
        on top of that), as the story follows the relationship between Koshiro Saeki and his younger sister, Nanoka. Now, incest is not exactly an issue anime shies away from, but it is rarely explored seriously. Usually, it is used in anime for shock factor, Hansel and Gretel  from Black Lagoon for example, or to satisfy some strange otaku fetish. However, by dealing with the issue maturely, Koi Kaze depicts what people in this kind of relationship might actually be going through. The relationship between Koshiro and Nanoka is constantly in a delicate balance, as the two struggle with their feelings (especially Koshiro). However, it also packs more genuine warmth and feeling than most typical anime relationships, which makes the conflict with taboo all the more potent. While there are definitely some very discomforting moments that will doubtlessly be too much for some viewers (notably a scene that takes place in the laundry room in episode 4), they only strengthen the story and its themes.<br />
<br />
The subject matter being as controversial as it is, puts tremendous importance on the characters, and luckily Koi Kaze is blessed with an incredible pair of leads. Koshiro is in his late 20s and is starting to feel the weight of his years, becoming somewhat apathetic and emotionally numb, but also having a deep rooted frustration, especially in light of a recent break-up. It is easy to feel his pain and sympathize with him even as he struggles with personal issues that are, in all honesty, pretty creepy. On the other side of the spectrum, there is Nanoka who is still in high school, and dealing with the insecurities of adolescence, particularly concerning boys. The anxieties these two characters face and the way they find comfort within each other feels so real, so plausable, that it is actually kind of scary. The rest of the cast falls strictly into supporting roles. They all have distinctive and believable personalities, but they just feel like background compared to the two leads. An exception is Koshiro&#039;s co-worker, Kaname Chidori (No, not from Full Metal Panic), who plays a pivotal role in the later episodes, and my personal favorite character from the show. There is also Koshiro&#039;s other co-worker, Odagiri, who is an intolerable pervert and failed comic relief; it would have been better if he had not existed.<br />
<br />
On the technical-side, Koi Kaze is a mixed bag. The visuals, while not bad, are on the prettier side of unimpressive. The subdued color scheme is quite nice, and it is nice to see normal looking people in an anime, but nothing really pops out. The backgrounds are pretty standard and are what you would expect from any slice-of-life. The animation is passable, and at times quite good, especially in the sequences with petals or Nanoka&#039;s hair are being blown in the wind; but overall it certainly nothing to write home about. The music of Koi Kaze, however, is another story. The beautiful orchestral pieces, highlighted by piano, are just a joy to listen to. Even with the art being so-so, scenes are beautiful with this soundtrack supporting them. Add to that director Omori Tatahiro&#039;s cinematic sensibility, which makes the best of the visuals, and you have an impressive, if flawed, presentation.<br />
<br />
Due to it&#039;s content, Koi Kaze is not an easy anime to recommend. Incest is an uncomfortable topic, added to that is the large age difference of the main couple, and may people will immediately (understandably) be turned off by it. For those who do get over the subject matter , you will be hard pressed to find a more mature, well-written tale of forbidden love.

Welp...this is going to be a controversial review. Yet, I feel I have to write it. I heard that Koi Kaze was a very beautiful and moving romance, so I put it on my watch list. I just finished &quot;His and Her Circumstances&quot;, and I loved that one so much I wanted to start a new romance anime. Koi Kaze isn&#039;t exactly what I went in expecting. <br />
<br />
Can a talented artist make any foul subject beautiful? That&#039;s one of the things Charles Baudelaire experimented with in Flowers of Evil. Within that collection, there is a poem called &quot;Une Charogne&quot; or &quot;The carcass&quot;. The poem was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317417">
        called indecent and grotesque upon release because it vividly describes a rotting female corpse and describes the corpse in sexual terms. The speaker isn&#039;t at all repulsed because he accepts that death comes for us all. Even the most beautiful women will one day resemble the horrible corpse.<br />
<br />
Koi Kaze is the writer of Baccano and the director of Baccano attempting to tell a beautiful romance between a 30 year old man and his 15 year old sister. Not step sister mind you. I mean full on blood relative. There is a LOT of sister fetish stuff in anime, but it&#039;s always played as a joke. They know it&#039;s a gross fetish and don&#039;t want to be accused of seriously condoning it. It&#039;s the stuff of echii and hentai where one can indulge in their most depraved and secret fetishes. Koi Kaze is a dead serious romance for adults. The series doesn&#039;t say our young lovers are correct, but it doesn&#039;t say they&#039;re wrong. The series wants you to see the relationship as beautiful, but it&#039;s up to the audience to decide. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve decided...and I don&#039;t like it. I watched a series where a guy has sex with a robot girl and I was fine with it. She&#039;s full artificial intelligence and they&#039;re in a consenting relationship. They won&#039;t produce children, but not everyone needs to have kids. I watched an anime where the guy ends up with the girl who murdered his family. I thought it was a tragic, yet beautiful and moving romance. I&#039;m pretty liberal with my anime romances. I have to put my foot down on Koi Kaze though.<br />
<br />
It turns out that deep within the dark recesses of my soul, there lives an angry and self righteous eugenicist. I call him Fritz! Koi Kaze manages to bring Fritz to the surface. He wants to kill these 2 immediately to protect the gene pool. He also wants to use government policing to reduce the global fertility rate and genetic engineering to increase human IQ. Fritz is an asshole and I don&#039;t condone his opinions. Thanks to Koi Kaze though, I&#039;ve had to confront my own shadow. I now know that he lives within me and I&#039;ll never be truly rid of him. Thanks Koi Kaze!<br />
<br />
The first episode starts with our male hero Koshiro meeting the high school first year Nanoka on a subway. Both of them have recently been dumped and can each sense the other&#039;s loneliness. Nanoka invites Koshiro to a theme park and he accepts. They share a romantic Ferris Wheel ride together and you already know these 2 are going to bang soon. At this point it&#039;s just pedophilia, but we find out they&#039;re siblings at the very end of the first episode. What follows is a carefully written and wonderfully presented romance...that makes me want to vomit and summons Fritz from the dark depths where I keep him repressed.<br />
<br />
The art is by the same studio that did the first Kino&#039;s Journey, which I love. I&#039;m not a big fan of the character art though because everyone has a white mouth instead of a red one during lip flaps. It&#039;s a minor detail, but I hate it! The music is another strength of the series. Of course, it could be playing the most angelic music in the world and I would still hate this show.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would suggest this anime only to those who can be VERY open minded. There is talent and effort here. However, I was too repulsed to get a lot of personal enjoyment out of it.

    Koi Kaze (13 Episodes)<br />
<br />
There&#039;s only one way to put this series and that&#039;s simply amazing. The series Koi Kaze is one of those rare gems that truly stimulate the human mind and lets it&#039;s audience in on the real nature of life and how something like incest that might be grotesque to some can actually be something so beautiful. I&#039;ll admit I was a bit skeptical at first but Koi Kaze demonstrated how a masterpiece should convey it&#039;s characters feelings, emotions, and problems.<br />
<br />
Koi Kaze is about an ordinary man named Koshiro who works as a wedding planner.He lives at home with his father and goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review18050">
        about his daily commute as per usual. One day however a fateful encounter changed his life forever. Koshiro met a beautiful young girl named Nanoka on a train, As she was leaving she had dropped her pass, Koshiro picked up the pass and returned it only too notice that this girl was very young and very beautiful. A seemingly normal encounter one would say, &quot;o&#039; how mistaken you are&quot;. As fate would have it Koshiro was getting a house mate and that this person would be his long lost sister. Koshiro layed eyes on this new house mate only too find out that it was the girl whom he had met on the train. The road to love and incest soon followed as the characters fight their feelings for each other.<br />
<br />
The animation was decent and at time the imagery was vibrant and quite elegant. The animation definitely fit the tone of the series. The audio quality was also excellent. The voice casting was perfect fitting each character well. The music for the series fit the emotional sequences to a tee. In all this series had a perfect blend of element for a Slice of life drama. every encounter the characters faced felt as though you could feel their pains and anguish. There were times were I actually felt nervous for the characters and how they went about facing there problems.<br />
<br />
In conclusion Koi Kaze was simply a masterpiece. If anyone is looking to get into a Slice of life that deals with a topic that not many take seriously and wants a real life take on the subject of incest. Then please do give this series a watch.<br />
<br />

    Let me start this review by saying that Koi Kaze is the most depressing anime I have seen. A love that cannot blossom does just that gradually throughout the series, with the viewers’ sense of dread building along with the story. This is not for kids.<br />
<br />
There are MINOR spoilers when describing the story/characters below. Nothing too major but I thought I would mention it in case the reader wants to go in knowing near to nothing.<br />
<br />
::Plot::<br />
<br />
The plot of Koi Koze is very simple -- A brother and a sister who haven&#039;t seen each other since they were very little start living together (along with their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2619">
        father) when 15 year old Nanoka (who had been living with the siblings’ mother) needs to move closer to her new school. The brother, Koshiro, is 27, meaning there&#039;s a 12 year age gap between the siblings. The two instantly have a connection and feelings for each other that go above simple friendship/family feelings.<br />
<br />
Before the pair learns they are brother and sister, they bump into each other on a train after Nanoka drops her ID card. They later randomly bump into each again, ending up going together to an amusement park since Koshiro had just been given 2 tickets. They end up having a heart to heart, telling each other about their love problems, Koshiro ending up crying. They find out they are siblings when their dad meets them together as they&#039;re exiting the amusement park.<br />
<br />
Koshiro&#039;s initial reaction to the sister revelation is to be nasty to her, hiding the conflict going on inside himself. He doesn&#039;t want to face up to his feelings for her, choosing instead to simply act like a bad brother. Nanako, being young and naive, initially has no idea about Koshiro&#039;s feelings and doesn&#039;t understand her own, leading her to be confused about Koshiro&#039;s transformation from nice guy to bad brother. She does manage to discover he does care for her due to his actions - concerned when she has period cramps, worried when she&#039;s out in the rain, jealous when she&#039;s talking to boys, etc.<br />
<br />
As you might have worked out after reading the above, Koi Kaze deals with a taboo subject without really holding back. That doesn&#039;t mean incest is glorified here (if anything it&#039;s the opposite since the story is tragic); what the story does is show a true love that can never be in this world. Both parties don&#039;t want to feel how they do; they just do and cannot change it.<br />
<br />
The series progresses at a slow pace as their relationship develops. At first it bothered me that nothing seemed to be happening, but once it gripped me the episodes seemed to be going much faster. Give it chance before dropping it.<br />
<br />
::Characterisation:: <br />
<br />
With the focus being on the love between two siblings, the two get a lot of attention.<br />
<br />
Koshiro is constantly in conflict with himself throughout the series. His brain knows what he&#039;s thinking and doing is wrong, yet his heart tells him otherwise. He tries to hide his inner conflict from Nanako by simply being a bad brother at first, attempting to push her away. His guilt over how he feels eventually drops down and allows him to be VERY friendly with her, but he still knows it&#039;s wrong to think and feel how he does about his kid sister.<br />
<br />
Nanako, on the other hand, doesn&#039;t have the same conflict Koshiro has going on right from the start. Being naive, she takes his aggressive attitude as nothing more than him being a bad brother, not able to understand what reason he could possibly have to act the way he does. She does eventually start to understand that her own feelings are above and beyond sisterly love, leading to the feelings of both coming out in the open.<br />
<br />
Both characters have a lot of depth, as you&#039;d expect. The rest of the cast don&#039;t really get fleshed out very much, but that doesn&#039;t matter an awful lot when the 2 most important characters do get fully fleshed out, hence the high rating.<br />
<br />
::Art / Animation::<br />
<br />
It looks and moves well enough for a show without any action sequences. The art, while not of the highest level, looks good enough to make Nanako look like the cutest thing I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
There are no problems, the series is in wide-screen and it looks more than good enough for a series that doesn&#039;t have action driving it onwards.<br />
<br />
::Sound::<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t like the soundtrack very much at first due to there not being many tracks that stand out. However, on reflection, I understand that the music used was pretty much perfect for this type of show - it&#039;s irrelevant how many tracks there are that I&#039;d listen to away from the series; the only thing that matters is that the music fits the series and sets the right mood for whatever scene it&#039;s playing during, which the Koi Kaze soundtrack does.<br />
<br />
Total: 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall, Koi Kaze is one the best series I&#039;ve ever watched...along with it being the most depressing and one of the most unsettling. If you can handle a tragic story, this series is unmissable.

    Koi Kaze’s premise is not a conventional romance title. The series is an exploration on incest, one of the biggest societal taboos of humanity and it is sure to make many people uncomfortable upon first seeing it. I went through that feeling when I first heard of the series in 2005. And in an e-mail reply I got back from Koshiro’s English dub actor Patrick Seitz in that same year, it was surprising to him that the title was even licensed and distributed in America. Here’s a passage from said e-mail that I’ve kept for a while now:<br />
<br />
“When Liam, the director, told me about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33817">
        show&#039;s subject matter, I was pretty taken aback--not by the prospect of playing such a character, which I relished as the challenge it was, but at the fact that Geneon had slated it for a release in the first place. Like you said, who in their right mind is going to toss a serious anime serious about incest onto an unsuspecting (and largely unprepared) Western audience?”<br />
<br />
The major strengths of Koi Kaze are the screenwriting and the lead characters. Both blend quite effectively at creating a believable focus on the awkward developments of Koshiro and Nanoka’s relationship. These two characters are at different stages of their lives and have different levels of understanding on the norms of society.<br />
<br />
Throughout much of the series, Koshiro finds himself in an internal conflict over how to deal with the growing feelings he has for Nanoka. He knows such feelings are forbidden in society yet he is trying to be honest with himself. As a result, being around Nanoka makes him feel awkward as he quite often acts coldly towards her to hide how he truly feels.<br />
<br />
Nanoka is just starting off high school and comes across as a naive girl at first glance. While not knowing of many of the societal norms expected of her, she is honest and direct with how she expresses herself towards others, especially in tense situations. The girl also has a playful side to her personality that she exhibits on occasion in Koi Kaze.<br />
<br />
In regards to the development of this forbidden relationship, Koi Kaze carefully treads a delicate line with the handling of the relationship without giving in to the conventional clichés that are found in many romance anime titles of recent memory. The characters have their imperfections and all their decisions have repercussions that they grow to accept as the series presses on. In addition, Koi Kaze maintains a neutral position in how to make viewers judge Nanoka and Koshiro’s relationship. The series neither approves nor disapproves of the relationship and there is no clear ending to the series. Instead, we are just left to wonder what kind of future that the pairing will have and whether or not we could make the decisions they made if we were in their situation.<br />
<br />
Beyond the two main characters, the secondary ones are a mixed bunch. Nanoka and Koshiro’s father, Zenzo, is constantly worried about Nanoka and is quite clueless over the problems between his two children. Koshiro’s co-worker, the lolicon Odagiri, often kills the mood of some of the tense situations that take place. Mother Makie appears quite level-headed with supporting her children, but doesn’t have much time onscreen. Koshiro’s girlfriend and Nanoka’s classmates do their parts at pushing each protagonist towards coming to grips with how they really feel. Koshiro’s supervisor Kaname Chidori is the best of the bunch with her role towards the later third of the series.<br />
<br />
In terms of visuals, the artwork seems lacking as scenery is rather simplistic in detail and colors look rather faded. Character designs, while just as simplistic, show a good diversity of looks adding to the real life believability of Koi Kaze. Compare a rough and unshaven man like Koshiro to the innocent beauty of Nanoka to catch my drift. The soundtrack features soft, light tracks that do well to accompany the delicate mood of this series. The show knows when to play its music or to keep things silent during specific scenes.<br />
<br />
Koi Kaze is a series that won’t be for all viewers. The themes of the series will keep some viewers from watching it and only those with an open mind would be able to take in what they see. If you are one with an open mind, then you can look forward to a mature, tasteful, and honest look at a controversial issue that has not been seriously explored in anime.

    I for one am a person that likes to judge a situation based on my own personal experiences, but how far can I judge a scenario based on MY OWN experiences? The more I look into many tropes, the more I begin to realize that my own incentives on a situation can be appallingly naive and to truly understand certain scenario&#039;s, you truly need to see the bigger picture. Koi Kaze is one show where none of my personal incentives and experiences could have prepared me for its outcome.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is Koi Kaze&#039;s brutal honesty on the subject matter that it explores that makes this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120131">
        a truly distinguishable feature from any other show that has dealt with incest in the past. Not limited to the general fetish-pandering occupation of incest related series in anime and manga. It is also hard to find any movie or any other series that deals with the subject of incest as profoundly and maturely as Koi Kaze anywhere else in the world.<br />
<br />
 I imagine it would be very difficult for many people to take a relationship between a 15 year old girl and 27 year old man seriously. With that in mind, as I am writing this review. I am heavily reminded of a strange case that occurred in the US in 2012 where a 32 year old man was having a consensual incestuous relationship with his 18 year old daughter. The documented evidence of the case showed that the circumstances in that relationship were almost exactly the same as the situation that Koi Kaze envisions.<br />
<br />
 Koi Kaze&#039;s plausibility is an interesting topic to research. Many family, sociological and (occasionally) anthropological studies have identified many possibilities in as to why an incestuous relationship would develop, asking why such a thing would happen? and the reasons for it? I wish to make mention of an interesting article that I stumbled across that was written by L.S. Penton-Voak, who along with others, carried out a computational analysis that found almost every couple that they interviewed and analysed, had faces that were allegedly similar to one another. I mention this because siblings being attractive to one another may not seem to be so far-fetched an idea when you take into consideration that they are made of the same genetic make-up and will thus likely have many similar facial structures, tones and other features.<br />
 At a deeper and more important level is a phenomenon cited by Edvard Westermarck, called the Westermarck effect that states that an incestuous relationship is more likely to develop if the elder of the family member involved in the relationship does not recall living through the younger individuals developmental stages of childhood and adolescence and vice versa. These theories of Genetic Sexual Attraction carry a lot of weight on Koi Kaze&#039;s content and makes its realism far more possible if I were to compare the show to a real life scenario (as mentioned in the case above).<br />
<br />
 Incest is mostly illegal due to the associated genetic deficiency&#039;s that occur through incestuous reproduction. Thus becoming an argument based on the human rights of the child. This is another sociological perspective that I wish to explore because Koi Kaze looks at the relationship without the idea of an offspring becoming involved and wishes to emphasize the emotional tension that develops between the characters, it is interesting in how I would judge this scenario. Would I consider the relationship acceptable if a child were to come into the midst or not? Like every other aspect of this series, it doesn&#039;t make a judgement but merely observes.<br />
 I mention all of these points as I believe it builds a crucial context for the series. I am encouraging a look into the greater aspects that this series is earnestly but subtly conveying.<br />
<br />
 Koi Kaze develops the relationship between the couple taking particular time and effort on emphasizing the gradual isolation that Koshiro and Nanako receive in the eyes of the greater community. Whilst making time to recognize the characters turmoils from accepting and carrying out such a harsh and difficult decision. The constant threat of society looming, only serves to ostracize them even further. I imagine that this would be exactly what would happen if an incestuous relationship were to be discovered in my home country. The general consensus would be that any &quot;reasonable&quot; adult would think poorly of the situation. It is these details, that make Koi Kaze&#039;s story almost genius, it begs to subtly question every little detail that I would usually consider to be wrong and turns it on its head.<br />
<br />
 Inspite of this praise, Koi Kaze is not as perfect as I would hope for it to be. As you can probably tell with my score. There are a couple, if not a few downsides to the story that make it very difficult for me to give it a 10/10.<br />
 Before I go into actual criticisms, one thing that I did want to criticize Koi Kaze for was its romantic nature, but after much pondering, I found myself disregarding this criticism. I asked myself. Why is this? Koi Kaze wants us to observe the situation at hand from its characters. Speaking realistically, romance is something that I would want to experience in a relationship as well. I think it would be kind of rude for a person to step in and say that a romantic atmosphere is not allowed in any relationship that I may have. Koi Kaze in doing this displays that it is treating its topic maturely and taking itself very seriously and not trying to be a social dictator on the themes that it explores.<br />
<br />
 With that out of the way, onto criticisms. The first thing I want to point out is that there is this one particular guy in the supporting cast who I just WANT TO KILL, and I regret to say that for a few instances he made me question the shows intentions. Mostly due to the questionable conversations and topics that he brought up without hesitation. However, after finishing the series, most of my suspicions for that particular character are somewhat vented towards an ill-gotten attempt at humor because at one point in the series he only receives the lime-light and never becomes the center of attention again. This might be more of an insight into cultural differences between my home country and Japan, so I will only let it pass, just barely though. However, in saying that, the character still contributes to the thematic concerns the story envelopes. Most particularly highlighting the type of attention that those kind of people get in the face of society.<br />
<br />
 I&#039;d hate to broken record here, but one thing that seems to bother me is some of the cliche situations. Seriously how often have we seen a romantic scene take place on a ferris-wheel? I don&#039;t want to say this, because from a personal perspective the scene in question (along with some other scenes) was very powerful and well-done, but I just couldn&#039;t help be reminded of the many times that it has been used before.<br />
<br />
 However, in spite of saying this, I found that these moments are easily ignored because the series puts so much time and effort into making each of these moments as effective and memorable as possible which is more than I can say for many other shows that do the same. Thus fortunately not decreasing the score by much in my book.<br />
<br />
 Another downside to the story is arguably in the way that it ends. Whilst I for one had no major problems with the series ending, I still found myself saying. It can still do more. The story could have gone further into the future turmoils or even the future beauties that the couple will possibly experience. What is the future of their relationship?  Whilst this outcome leaves much to speculation, it still stands that Koi Kaze adequately explores the concepts that it had originally given us.<br />
<br />
Koi Kaze recognizes all of the aspects of its story by giving its main characters significant development. The extent to which Koi kaze achieves this is recognized on the many occasions in each and every episode where a character questions the activities of what they are partaking in: What will my family think? What will everyone else think? Should I be doing this? How will I feel afterwards? What are the consequences?<br />
<br />
 These rhetoric&#039;s constantly build upon one another, with highly appropriate timing and never going out of its way to lecture the viewer. Instead it creates some of the most multi-layered characters I have ever encountered. The two leads are particularly complex, in the way that they display and handle the situation that they are dealing with. For example, the defensive barrier that Koshiro establishes; a facade so that his feelings don&#039;t hurt Nanoka, and much the same with Nanoka with some honest interaction that is neither complacent nor entirely naive.<br />
<br />
 As I mentioned in the Story section, most of the characters are put there to look at the situation from different perspectives. One character that I wanted to give particular praise to is &quot;Chidori, Kaname&quot;. What she does is offer a confrontational perspective on the themes being explored and interestingly enough I believed that she was representative of most viewers watching. A person who, whilst having good intentions, barges into someone&#039;s life to inform them that what they are doing is wrong in the eyes of society, basically speaks for 95 per-cent of the people watching, especially those raised with Western moral incentives. It poses a question, how much do we really know about the people that are experiencing such a situation? Do we have any right to interfere?<br />
<br />
 Each and every character achieves what they set out to do (yes, even the abominable character I mentioned in the story section) and for that I can say that Koi Kaze has great three-dimensional, well written characters that are removed from the traditional character archetypes of the incestual anime sub-genre.<br />
<br />
 Much of Koi Kaze&#039;s art correlates perfectly with the serious tones imbued within the story. The entire show is drawn on a very subdued pallet which makes the series very easy to look at; it isn&#039;t intense nor is it dramatic and I must say this was the almost perfect blend.<br />
<br />
 The character designs are interesting in where they look absolutely natural. Unlike many other series out there including the many series that don&#039;t follow the mainstream, Koi Kaze still stands out. The designs particularly for the male lead are more representative of an average person you would walk past in the street. Giving more credit to Koi Kaze&#039;s intentions as a realistic series. Even the main female lead, I would say is perfectly comparable to someone I would consider her age. This, whilst being a bold move is essentially putting the cream on the cake. It works together with the series and blends in perfectly with the soft, non-tenuous backgrounds of the series.<br />
<br />
 However, one thing that bothers me big time with the art is simply the white mouths of every character. Seriously they are the biggest eye-sore. How hard is it to draw the insides of a mouth? Come on. Other than that minor complaint, the art overall captures the emotional intensity that the series is conveying exceptionally well and any other style of art would probably have carried many negative connotations in the face of the thematic concerns that the series is dealing with.<br />
<br />
The sound runs parallel to the other technical aspects of Koi Kaze; in fact, it is actually surprising how well the technical aspects of this series meld together. Much of the OST consists or original tracks that are a dual mix of mellow and soft beautiful sounds. Most of the music is composed through a small assortment of wind, and string instruments and the occasional piano piece. This collection of tracks make a terrific soundtrack that is somewhat memorable and is very nice to listen to, within the context of the show and outside the context as well.<br />
<br />
 A particular track that I wish to mention is Masanori Takumi&#039;s &quot;Main Theme&quot;. Whilst it isn&#039;t what I would call the best soundtrack of the OST, it certainly stands out when I take into consideration in how appropriately it was used in the series. I thought every scene that used that particular soundtrack was perplexing and the track used only served to drive the potency and overall impact of the scenes.<br />
<br />
As for the entertainment factor. Koi Kaze doesn&#039;t have anything going for it in the excitement department because at it&#039;s core it is a slice-of-life series and observing the every-day actions of a persons lifestyle is certainly not everyone&#039;s cup of tea. However whilst Koi Kaze&#039;s goal doesn&#039;t appear to be stimulation with special effects or hyper-realistic excitement, it needs to be genuinely noted that there were many moments in Koi Kaze that were highly engaging, encouraged a level of sympathy and empathy that weren&#039;t forced but bloomed with the phenomenal writing that the series offers.<br />
<br />
 I think that a well developed drama insights that the characters and their actions, development and their surroundings all meld together to lead to a conclusion that is inevitable and Koi Kaze does this extremely well. The direction that it takes whilst being highly questionable on the surface, quickly builds into a multi-layered that story that builds an insight into the turmoils of the two main character&#039;s, and the tension was so strong at times that I couldn&#039;t help be pushed to tears in disbelief at how society can be so unintentionally cruel. And as much as I am a sucker for a good drama and a show that deals with unorthodox relationships, Koi Kaze was the cream of the crop of its genre.<br />
<br />
I believe that what makes Koi Kaze work as a series is its overall tone and its achievement of keeping the themes that it explores constantly in the grey. From a personal perspective, the fact that it managed to completely challenge everything that I had originally thought of the topic of incest makes this an experience unlike anything that I have encountered. It is intriguing, intelligent, mature and very risky.<br />
<br />
 As for recommending the series. Well, naturally, the adult themes in this show will make it a turn-off for most potential viewers but for anyone interested in seeing a well-written story about forbidden love. From my perspective at least, Koi Kaze is probably one of the best achievements in any medium.<br />

    Did you guys even watch the anime. What&#039;s with everyone calling it &quot;beautiful&quot; , lets ignore the taboo subject for a moment. The art was ugly, Koshiro looked like the pleasure face meme half the time and I couldn&#039;t stop laughing. Nanoka looked like your basic moe girl and to that one reviewer who said she was a realisitc portrayal of a 15 year old, I hope you never get close enough to an actual 15 year old to find out they are not like this at all.  There was a scene of a bicycle rolling down the street and the wheels weren&#039;t moving

          <span style="display: none;" id="review224310">
        someone kept moving it forward each frame but it had NO animation done except moving from one part of the screen to another. The person&#039;s legs didn&#039;t even move. It was so embarrassing. <br />
<br />
Now lets move onto sound, you can sum of Koshiro&#039;s character with &quot;grunts a lot&quot;. The music was out of place and horrible, you can&#039;t fit goofy slice of life music into random parts to make it seem funny! Like come on, there&#039;s nothing funny about this anime. There was this one scene after one of the many awkward pauses where music randomly starts blaring. Oh yeah, the pauses, THERE&#039;S SO MANY RANDOM 4-5 SECOND PAUSES. I don&#039;t think the editors wanted to replay the scene to have to sit through it again to be honest.<br />
<br />
Characters, oh, ok, Koshiro a basic tsundere asshole. The office pervert was only put into to make Koshiro seem like a good guy, in reality he&#039;s a piece of shit. The only two good characters are the dad and Kaname who rightfully beat up Koshiro in one scene. That was the best scene.<br />
<br />
Back to  the story, it&#039;s fake sentimentality trying to make you feel bad for Koshiro, I think, because if you felt bad for Nanoka you&#039;re only feeling bad bc she had to be around this idiot that doesn&#039;t know when to stop sniffing her bra. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment, fun to make fun of not gonna lie but still rating it 1 because I hate the general idea of this. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you want a story featuring incest, don&#039;t.

     I thought this anime was EXQUISITE. Yes, the topic of incest makes me a little uncomfortable but i really wanted to open up to the story so I put aside my preconceptions and just watched the anime through. <br />
I must say that if watched with an open mind, it is very very touching, mind opening and heart wrenching. The characters know damn well what they&#039;re doing and the risks and taboos associated with their relationship and this moves the anime into being a tear jerking testament of the character&#039;s inner struggles with accepting their feelings... and having the courage to follow them. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
As I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11814">
        said, the story is fabulous. The portrayal of emotion in this series is so intense and so thorough that you grow to feel the characters&#039; pain and understand a great deal of the extent of their struggles. The series is written in way that makes the characters completely vulnerable to the viewer-- you see everything they feel and go through. Their weakness and their strengths, the extent of their true feelings for each other-- until the characters are so real and their relationship so fleshed out that you actually come to an understanding of why they come to feel and act the way the do. The thing that is truly brilliant about the story, however, is the pacing. The story is slow but deliberately so. You really see the characters feelings develop over time and their relationship blooms at a beautiful rate so you get to  see the full intensity of it. <br />
Overall, the story is achingly beautiful in its portrayal of emotions and human tendency and honest to the point of realism.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art is...beautiful. It is quite simple but in a way that compliments the anime completely and beautifully detailed and even original. The character design is great: the characters look unique in a very realistic way. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The acting is superb...the voices fit the characters really well too.<br />
The music is absolutely gorgeous and  very touching. The main piano piece that&#039;s played throughout is one of the most beautiful I&#039;ve ever heard...I remember it bringing tears to my eyes on numerous occasions.<br />
The music, like the anime, is simple and low-key but the undertones are incredibly touching and add to the somber yet intensely emotional feel of the anime.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters as I&#039;ve probably mentioned are very well developed to the point of seeming real.  Their very human emotions and how they act in reaction to what they feel are extremely relatable and believable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall<br />
 Koi Kaze, when watched with an open mind, is probably one of the most insightful and moving animes every created.  It&#039;s also by far one of best written series I&#039;ve ever seen. Though the themes in this series are extremely controversial I think that they could not have been handled in a more deeply sensitive and analytical way. I think this anime is one of the best portrayals of human nature and love out there.

    *Might contain very minor spoilers*<br />
<br />
I just watched this show in a marathon and felt I had to write something about it. Most reviews have said what I feel, but I want to add a couple of things.<br />
<br />
My large Point is; This story is for adults (or at least kids 15 or older). <br />
It takes a mature mind to understand the complexity of the feelings conveyed in this anime (and manga). <br />
I think it&#039;s perfectly fine for someone younger than that to watch it, but I really don&#039;t think they will understand the depth and agony.<br />
<br />
And agony there is. I was in something close to physical

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165345">
        pain, watching most of the series. A big lump in my throat, throbbing of the heart, tears burning and sometimes spilling over. <br />
Any person with empathy would feel the same, watching Koshiro being tormented by the feelings he doesn&#039;t want to have. Because he doesn&#039;t. He&#039;s not a perverted predator. <br />
He tries as hard as he can to fight the feelings, as long as he can.<br />
     There is a very fine line here - to show his emotions in a way that makes it clear that this is someone to be pitied, not prosecuted - and I think the creator of the story pulls it off. Koshiro trult feels like a victim just as much as Nanoka does. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a story condoning incest or taking lightly on the subject - it&#039;s a story about love and how it sometimes can be so hard, so cruel, so bitter.<br />
We don&#039;t choose whom we fall in love with. It just happens. And sometimes it&#039;s not between the &quot;right&quot; people. <br />
Koshiro is not taking advantage of Nanoka, they are just acting on their mutual feelings of love.<br />
<br />
     I have two brothers, and I have certainly never felt anything like this for either of them, so I can&#039;t say that I know what it&#039;s like to have a love so forbidden. But I HAVE loved someone who wasn&#039;t &quot;appropriate&quot; - with a very large age difference among other problematic things. <br />
So I can relate to that - nurturing a love which was scolded upon by people close to me and him.<br />
     Also, when I was Nanoka&#039;s age (she seemed to be around 16,5 yrs at the time of the physical part of the relationship between her and her brother) I was fully capable of deciding my own feelings and had a fleeting relationship with someone about 10 years older. There was no taking advantage of from his side, it was initiated by me.<br />
     Age is just a number when it really comes down to it - if it&#039;s love from both sides it doesn&#039;t matter - an older person taking advantage of a younger one, is wrong. Of course. <br />
(I am definitely not saying that relationships between schoolkids and adults are ok - usually they are very wrong - but I can assure you that a 16 year old is not a child. <br />
     In my country the age of consent is 15 years. For an adult (above 18 years of age) to have sex with someone over 15 years of age, is not a crime. And I think that is a perfectly good age limit. <br />
In Japan, where this story takes place - the age of consent is 13 years.<br />
So - Nanoka is by law not considered a child regarding sexual acts.)<br />
<br />
Besides my blathering - I do recommend this anime for anyone who is in search of something that can give them a ride of emotions. <br />
Which is what I search for when I look for new anime to watch. <br />
This made me feel - a lot. <br />
Not exactly something I would want to rewatch many times, it hurts too much for that - but something I am glad that I did watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
I absolutely hated the art at first - it&#039;s so... rough. <br />
But when I got used to it, I appreciated it a lot. The crudeness makes it realistic in some way.  Also, the fact that no one is Picture Perfect, abnormally slim, chibi or alike, is very refreshing.<br />
Because this is a story about two - very real - people. <br />
And this intertwines with the character part - <br />
Nanoka isn&#039;t disgustingly babylike and trying to be cute - and Koshiro definitely isn&#039;t the fairytale Prince. They have their pros and cons and are very much like ordinary people.<br />
Nanoka is a bit childish and naïve - but she knows what she is feeling and doing. She is the leading one in the development of their relationship.<br />
Koshiro is never leading her on, in the contrary he is stubbornly fighting the inevitable. He&#039;s dense and blunt but his war against his own heart touches me deeply, I feel his anguish and it makes me sad. <br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t really all that original - the interesting about this anime is how the story is told. It&#039;s engulfing and bittersweet.<br />
<br />
The only thing about it I absolutey hated, was the horrible ending song - the sour notes of the singer of that disgustingly cheesy song - made me queasy. <br />
<br />
<br />
As a conclusion and the end of my rambling - I recommend this anime for anyone looking for an anime that makes one feel something. Even if it&#039;s mostly sadness. (But there are some sweet moments as well).<br />
<br />
<br />

    Koi Kaze is an heartfelt drama that touches on the taboo subject of incest (love between siblings). What would otherwise be discarded as a revolting subject, is brought to life with soft artwork and supreme storytelling. <br />
<br />
The artwork consists of soft lines with a pastel coloring system to provide a relaxing atmosphere for the viewer. It provides a pleasant change to the traditionally anime appearance. The backgrounds are well painted, yet still allow the characters to blend in nicely. The character animations themselves are pleasant and soft, yet still do nicely to express any and all emotions that they go through.<br />
<br />
The sounds and music are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1343">
        easy on the ears and flow well with the series to set the tone for scenes of drama or anxiety. The opening theme is lively yet peaceful as to settle the viewer down for the episode to come. The ending theme is bit softer yet the vocals are somewhat unconventional to say the least. The character voices are well done, even if the females sound a bit on the bland side. This was more than likely done intentionally to give a better sense of reality, as opposed to the high-pitched voices found in traditional anime.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are soft, vulnerable, and realistic considering their circumstances. Each character serves his or her own purpose without flaw and they combine to deliver a compelling sense of reality. For an anime that covers such a touchy subject, this was a key element and Koi Kaze captured it perfectly.<br />
<br />
The story, from the first encounter to the warm conclusion, never ceases to give it&#039;s viewers a visualization of how such a situation could very well play out in our modern society. To truly enjoy the series, one must put aside any judgemental views on the subject and take in the story as a whole. A highly recommended series of any fan of the soft-drama genre.

    I approached Koi Kaze with an open mind towards the incestuous relationship between Koshiro and Nanako and found that I just can&#039;t understand why people are saying it&#039;s a masterpiece. I pretty much forced myself to watch through all thirteen episodes. Of course, it wasn&#039;t the incest that really ruined the anime for me, but the, excuse my language, shitty character that Koshiro was.<br />
<br />
The anime yells out if not, slams it to our faces on how society frowns upon incestuous relationahips. Koshiro, who in my opinion was a spoiled brat when his childhood was shown and was also very immature for his age throughout the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review238635">
        entire show, succumbs to his &quot;feelings&quot; to Nanako. Let&#039;s be honest though, if any other young high school girl had gone with him to the amusement park, the story would be about a man who is twice the age of a girl rather than incest. Which to me just clearly reflects on why his  actual proper relationship crashed and burned. <br />
<br />
One could clearly see just from how Koshiro acts in his life that he really didn&#039;t care about anything nor has he really tried to pursue any career in life. Pretty much the main reason why he worked as a marriage counsellor was so he could see people become happy or sad. In my opinion, you can&#039;t really understand happiness without experiencing it yourself. And the same thing applies to love. So how would he understand what it&#039;s like to struggle in life for the things most precious to you when he hasn&#039;t done that at all? He liked to stick to a routine and was afraid to change and develop as an adult. No responsible adult would allow such a development to happen. <br />
<br />
Clearly he knew what he was doing was wrong, but he didn&#039;t retract, not because of love or feelings, but because of accessibility to sex and pleasure. He has a young girl who barely knows anything about the world itself and pretty much throws everything in her life that was good away for a man that hardly tried to reject the immorality between the two, taking away a future from her that could be looked upon with pride and happiness. Nanako was pretty much willing to do anything for Koshiro, but I&#039;m pretty sure it wasn&#039;t love that binded Koshiro to Nanako.<br />
<br />
One could argue that Nanako really did love Koshiro, but honestly I think it was just a fling. Nanako was finally starting to explore her sexuality, her interest in the opposite sex, and yet it was because of her irresponsible brother Koshiro who led her to believe that she was actually in love him. I think Nanako just wanted a brotherly or fatherly figure in her life and ultimately in the end her feelings and body were just taken advantage of. <br />
<br />
Koshiro is a good example of who not to become in life. When you relay emotions and communicate with people, you do it while looking in their eyes and speaking honestly. That way, people can understand when you speak to them. That is how relationships are formed. Relationships, whether romantic or platonic, between two people is suppose to be built from experiences, failures, weaknesses, and strengths. If you ignore these building blocks, the only thing you get is a one-sided relationship that obviously only benefits one person in the relationship. Koshiro failed to connect with people from the heart. He never truly tried to understand another person&#039;s feelings which is what led to this inevitable outcome. <br />
<br />
If you look at this anime from a human nature point of view rather than a romance, then I would actually think it deserves a good score.

    I did not dislike Koi Kaze. I want to phrase it this way to emphasize that this is a hard show to like and difficult to recommend. Unless you have an open mind and a strong tolerance for possibly offensive material this is a pass. Most people have no interest in a story about incestuous and possibly pedophilic relationships. Myself, I just happened to be curious as to how responsibly (or irresponsibly) the show handled this subject matter. Those caveats out of the way, to its credit, I thought Koi Kaze handled the dramatic elements very well. It dragged on a little at parts, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29875">
        the tone, atmosphere, and emotions were all respectable. It even had some interesting, if questionable, bits of humor. However, as my intro may have alluded, there were some flaws I felt that prevented Koi Kaze from being a really good (and well regarded) show. This review may contain spoilers so read on at your own risk.<br />
<br />
As is made evident by the synopsis/premise of the show, it is about a brother and sister (Koshiro and Nanoka), their parents, the sisters two school friends and the brothers two coworkers. Most of the time is primarily focused on the brother and sister, as it should be, and the show goes through great lengths to establish a sense of &quot;normalcy&quot; to the pair. They are not dislikable or unrelatable characters and for the most part they even seem to be completely rational and realistic. This is simultaneously the greatest strength of the show but also the source of its greatest weakness. <br />
<br />
If you are going to address a topic as divisive and controversial as incest and want it to be taken seriously, then it is of the utmost important that everything remains consistently and absolutely believable. Now this is no minor task or simple feat but unfortunately I feel Koi Kaze fell short in this area in two major ways. First, the siblings. The show asks a lot from the audience in regards to suspension of disbelief.  That a fully grown adult man, Koshiro, would be so overwhelmed by love at first sight over a young 15 year old girl already raises one eyebrow. The fact that the revelation of said girl being his sister does nothing to overcome his inexplicable passions raises the other. The show never makes the effort to convince you of why he would go against his surely average upbringing and exposure to social norms. In fact, it even establishes that he is not some inept sex-starved otaku pervert who longs for the touch of a woman (or little girl). That distinguishing honor is reserved for Koshiro&#039;s comedy relief creepy coworker Odagiri. Even the sister, Nanoka, shows some embarrassment when her friends introduce the idea of a &quot;brother complex&quot;. So it is clear that there is no misunderstanding that such a thing is wrong (or at least not pragmatically desirable). That the show doesn&#039;t eschew the morality and acceptability of such thoughts/feelings is its saving grace, but it also makes the characters actions all the more bewildering. When Nanoka does a complete 180 and develops a sudden onset of &quot;hot for brother&quot; your eyebrows are blown clean off your face. These kinds of extreme reactions defy all reason and experience.<br />
<br />
For the show to have any real meaning or merit the foundation must be sound and you have to convince the audience that characters are motivated by more than merely what the plot demands. That&#039;s really what it feels like when watching this. Like the plot is only advancing in order to fulfill the wishes of those who want to see the brother-sister relationship bloom. Why doesn&#039;t Koshiro ever consider psychiatric help? How does Nanoka go from regular platonic sibling relationship to a romantic one over the course of a few days (or one train ride)? Why do neither of them have interest or even try to seek relationships elsewhere? Developing a relationship with someone you&#039;ve recently met and barely know is already tricky enough, but to be so instantaneously attracted to someone despite various factors and incentives to do otherwise is a very tall order. This has to be thoroughly explained and fleshed out and not something you can just hand wave away. I get the idea that since they have hardly ever been around each other that them being related is almost &quot;not even real&quot;. Sure, but Koshiro&#039;s other coworker, Chidori, clearly lays out the hardships and misery that will follow and these consequences are very, very real. I also get the idea that &quot;true love conquers all&quot; but you don&#039;t just develop that out of thin air either. It&#039;d be one thing if they had been seeing each other for a long time and gotten emotionally involved at some point before the revelation, that would at least make sense. It&#039;s hard to take back feelings once they&#039;ve matured. Alternatively, had they at least slowly developed these feelings over a LONG period of time, and after trying everything else, then it could be understandable. To just shoehorn in this forced romance however is disingenuous and condescending to the audience and the show itself.<br />
<br />
Second, the ending. I&#039;m very critical and unforgiving about how endings are handled, and I was already disappointed by where the show went so this was crucial. For all its intent and even-handedness the ending to Koi Kaze is probably the greatest disservice. I say this because the show doesn&#039;t end with any kind of point. It doesn&#039;t try to proclaim that love is never wrong without exception, which at the very least I could respect if not exactly agree with. It just ends with a day in the life scene and everything is fine and there are no visible problems. There are multiple ways this show could have ended, but at the very least I would&#039;ve liked it to have ended with some representation of Chidori&#039;s warning, making it unmistakably clear that following such a path is dangerous and alienating. But the show doesn&#039;t have any strong feelings one way or the other. This came across as intellectually dishonest, because it&#039;s clear the creator knows better and knows the realities of such endeavors but doesn&#039;t leave on such a note. To ignore this is escapist fantasy at best and naive encouragement at worst.<br />
<br />
I watched this dubbed and found the actors to be good enough that I didn&#039;t feel compelled to go to subs. My problem was mostly with the writing and direction so I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any extra emphasis or emotion that the Japanese audio would have to make me feel any differently. The music was fine and complimented the show well. The animation was about average, varying from looking pretty good to pretty bad at times. Let me reiterate, I did not dislike Koi Kaze. I still think it was a very interesting if flawed attempt at a very daring and difficult subject. I just think had some more bold choices been made and more thought put into it I wouldn&#039;t even need to write this review as there would have been plenty of praise in its place.

    I just had to write a review for Koi Kaze as its been replaying in my mind for the whole day.  Koi Kaze is probably one of the most intense anime that I have seen... ever.  But this is based completely upon the subject matter of the series.  The growing sense of &amp;quot;do they or don&#039;t they&amp;quot; that is created with each passing episode is possibly the only thing that actually kept me watching - despite the short 13 episode span.<br />
<br />
Ok, so first off - let&#039;s start at the beginning.  The protagonist of the story, Koshiro, is a twenty-something man who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4744">
        works as a wedding planner.  Due to his parents divorce several years earlier, his own love life seems to be rather tragic.  At the time of the divorce, it was decided that Nanoka (his younger sister) would live with their mother, while Koshiro stayed with their father.  Up to the beginning of the anime, neither sibling had seen each other since the separation.  Meanwhile, the problems start when said younger sister moves in with her father and brother to save time on commuting to school.  One one such trips they meet when Nanoka drops her travel pass.  During the course of the day they meet again.  When their father shows up they discover themselves to be siblings, and things escalate from there.<br />
<br />
The &amp;quot;psychological&amp;quot; tag for this anime is completely appropriate, because it really does play on your mind.  The ides of incest will always remain a seriously taboo subject, but to see it happen in an anime is certainly an eye-opener.  And seeing as this is my first anime which had this particular topic - it was even more of an eye-opener than usual.  There&#039;s a lot of conflicting emotions also, Koshiro&#039;s need to protect his sister often clashes with his feelings of desire for her.  This often causes his moods to fluctuate, something that initially confuses Nanoka.  But then again, these are two people who have not seen each other in years - so, you can pretty much understand where this is coming from.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t really say if I loved or loathed this particular anime.  I&#039;m pretty much somewhere in the middle with this one, but at the same time I&#039;m actually quite glad that I have watched it, and I may even progress to read the manga.  If you&#039;re willing to try something different, then give Koi Kaze a try.

    Koi Kaze is an incest anime, so if that already turns you off well then don&#039;t watch this anime. I personally don&#039;t like incest anime but this was very good.<br />
<br />
The story in Koi Kaze is absolutly heart wrenching. A man who hasn&#039;t seen his sister in a long time runs into her and doesnt even realize who it is. When he finds out however that it is his sister he still can&#039;t shake his feelings towards her. So he goes into a sort of depression because he feels like a very sick person for loving his sister in a way that you shouldn&#039;t. Most of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7888">
        the anime continues on like this with him feeling like an idiot and falling more in love with his sister until the end when he finally makes up his mind......<br />
<br />
The art was really well done. At first when I started watching I thought it was a little rough but then slowly grew to love it. Some of the backgrounds are simply beautiful.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is amazingly done and the voices suit the characters perfectly.<br />
<br />
Characters are all developed very well and you grow to love and hate them. You get so lost in the characters in this anime that you actually feel like you know them.<br />
<br />
Overall I would say this anime is a really good one to watch but will probably be the only incest one I ever watch. After all I did stumble upon this one by accident.

    This anime is one of the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. It provides us with a story about a dude who is sexually attracted to his clearly underage sister, and it follows their relationship of living together after being apart for so many years. I really don&#039;t mind that the story takes on taboo themes, the only problem is that it does a terrible job with them. <br />
<br />
The characters start out fine. Koshiro, the older brother, is lonely and still living with his dad and he hasn&#039;t accomplished much with his life. Nanoka, the underage little sister, is bright, cheerful, and wants to spend time with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268996">
        her older brother after being reunited with him after so long. The father is old and is completely oblivious to what is going on between them, and so they start to spend time with each other and the lonely older brother begins to have feelings for his underage little sister. First off this is gross and cringey, a great way to push your audience away. And then the little sister, who is obviously confused about how to handle the hormonal changes in her body, begins to return his feelings! <br />
<br />
Anyways, it doesn&#039;t end well and all I could think was that I regretted my decision to watch this anime. We see this man spiral down into disaster and making terrible decisions the entire time and he suffers zero consequences from them. It&#039;s just absolutely unbelievable. The only positive scene from the entire series is that his co worker figures out what&#039;s going on and she lets him know what a horrible thing he&#039;s doing. Finally some consequences but that is literally the extent of his consequences. The reason why incest and pedophilia are taboo is because they will lead individuals and society into literal disaster. It was unbelievable how the movie was almost celebrating their relationship. Just garbage.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking about watching this because you&#039;re like me and you saw that quite a few people have favorited it, then don&#039;t because I saw it for you and can tell you the moral of the story: don&#039;t raise your sons to be unsocialized and incompetent freaks and don&#039;t raise your daughters to not be weary of unsocialized and incompetent freak men. But seriously it&#039;s disgusting so do yourself a favor and don&#039;t watch it.

    This anime may not be suitable for everyone, it takes a taboo subject as main theme: incest.  The story is well narrated with a lot of still shots, reflecting the conflict of the main character who falls in love with his younger sister. The music is very good and the art is nice. If you like character driven stories with strong conflicts then you may like it.

    &quot;Is it alright even if I love you?&quot;<br />
<br />
(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AND A LOVE STORY ABOUT INCEST, TOPIC THAT COULD BE DISTURBING OR DISGUSTING FOR SOME PEOPLE, IF DON&#039;T LIKE IT, SIMPLY IGNORE IT WITHOUT OFFENDING ME, THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING)<br />
<br />
&quot;Koi Kaze&quot; is a seinen anime of 13 episodes based on the manga written by Yoshida Motoi, a manga of 35 chapters.<br />
<br />
The story begins during Spring with the protagonist, Saeki Koushirou, a 27 years old employed man, who recently has been dumped by his girlfriend who said she was in love with another man. He then takes the train to go to his workplace, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review405951">
        he will then encounter the most beautiful cherry blossom he had ever seen, Nanoka Kohinata, a 15 years old girl who was returning from school. He will then notice she was crying, and that she has forgotten her train pass. He will eventually return it to her, and they will both feel a strong connection between them, despite being strangers with a big age difference. <br />
<br />
Soon later, they will encounter each other again near an amusement park, and they will decide to have a sort of &quot;date&quot; together and talk a bit with each other. While riding  a Ferris Wheel, they will both open up their heart about being recenlty rejected by their crush, surprised about how much coincidences they both shared.<br />
<br />
Koushirou will then break down and cry to his surprise, and he will then be comforted by Nanoka. He then realizes he is very attracted to her, without knowing that Nanoka feels the same. Right after the date, Koushirou will meet his father, and he will discover that Nanokai is in fact her younger sister, but that he couldn&#039;t meet her because of their parents&#039; divorce.<br />
<br />
They will be both very surprised, and they will try their best to forget their romantic feelings, especially Koushirou, both because she was his sister and because she was underage, however when they will have to live under the same roof, their feelings will grow more and more.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t a story for everyone, but I still think it shoud be seen by more people, to make us understand how love isn&#039;t a choice and that should be respected and understood.<br />
<br />
One time I was searching about incest, and I found an article about a daughter and a mother who loved each other and that because of that, they both had been arrested for years and years. Despite being very open minded, I still thought it was a bit strange, however I thought to myself: They just love each other, they aren&#039;t doing any bad things to the world or other people, it is really necessary and a right thing to do to arrest them just because they were both in love with each other? Even with the same penality duration of rapists and killers?<br />
<br />
 I honestly thought it was really ridiculous, and I began to think that incest is way more normal than what we think, especially because we all come from incestuous relationships. That&#039;s why we are all here, but I understand that it is better if incestuous couples do not have kids, for the Children&#039;s health.<br />
<br />
I really hope that one day all of us will see incestuous love like we now see homosexual love, because it really is nothing more than just LOVE.<br />
Incestuous relationships will simply be like them, unfortunate couples who can&#039;t have kids, but that still deserves to be respected and to have their own happiness, even if it is a really peculiar one.<br />
<br />
They don&#039;t do any bad to society, that&#039;s why we should let them be.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, some countries like Japan have legalized incest, however many countries (My country included) still do not accept it.<br />
I really hope we will become even more open minded than we are one day, and that incestuous people will not have to live in shame or hiding in the shadows, because they are people just like us who are in love.<br />
<br />
Please try to respect it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for reading my review and have fun on mal as always! &lt;3<br />
<br />

    I know that my rating may seem exaggerated but it&#039;s really not. The story? Inexistent. Art? Disgusting. Sound? Obnoxious. Character? NANI? There&#039;s no character development. Enjoyment? None but I just can&#039;t ever drop a short series, I finish em all.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s trash.<br />
<br />
Whoever thinks that this is good, you haven&#039;t seen anything good. The moment the girl understands that she&#039;s in love, nothing good has happened yet. Her brother has been an asshole to her the whole time until then and on his side, he fell in love with her underage body and that slave-like culture of japanese women, that&#039;s all. They haven&#039;t had much time

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401499">
        together yet and she&#039;s just been doing everything at home and he thinks she looks good, that&#039;s all.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no actual relationship being developed here. It&#039;s just 2 badly written character that an author wanted to match together. This is an illogical and inorganic anime without any subtance or life. It tries really hard to be deep but it&#039;s just shallow and pathetic.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against true love, good endings and all that but that this anime ended this way is just wrong. It doesn&#039;t fit the poor script.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen this compared to Domestic Girlfriend which is the only reason why I&#039;ve wasted my time here and it couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. DG is everything this anime is trying to be. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t ever understand why the rating for this isn&#039;t under 4 but I guess that there are too many immature children reviewing animes.

    .... how do I start ... ok  this a non-spoiler anime, so I am going to review it from that point of view. forgive my bad grammar its 2:30am and I feel I need to write this before I take a nap ... <br />
<br />
Now this may surprise you but, this is one of the most enjoyable anime&#039;s I have ever seen, this compared to over the top action, acrobatics ninjas, boob flying, comedy, ecchi ridden anime&#039;s, why you ask ... very simple ... because of the characters !!!!! DAMN they where voiced (I suggest watching this subbed), written and completely orchestrated so well it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143875">
        completely kept me on the edge of my seat through out .. and NOT a lot of anime will do that ... <br />
<br />
firstly the characters: we got our typical older brother Koshiro, 27 years old, seems lost in his job and In his love life just recently been dumped by hid GF of 2 years and coldly it seems brushing it off (p.s. she was a damn hottie, sorry ladies I sounded a bit clichéd there), funnily his job seems to be a marriage counsellor he might be trying to find love by seeing the love through others ?? who knows ... he is portrayed as pretty cool and relaxed kind of person and lazy at home nothing to spectacular .... until hehehe read below <br />
then we got Nanoka who is a sweet high school sister of koshiro, but really she has no special moves or over the top boobs or long legs or any features that have men generally popping their eyes out for ... she is VERY Average in terms of appearance and very innocent in terms of character .... <br />
all I can say is when Koshiro has feeling for her which we can clearly see early on in the anime, its probably something like true feeling from the heart aka love and it has to be with his sibling, its a huge struggle for him to fight or accept these feelings and the joy of watching him go through the yoyo&#039;s of his feeling is absolutely BRILLIANT ... the LAST time I saw something THIS good was &quot;welcome to the N.H.K&quot; because the story can take you in 1000 different direction and you personally want it to go in a particular way and when it doesn&#039;t you begin to laugh and say to yourself okay what is he going to do from here now .... the poor guys go through SO many Trials and Tribulations its unreal, some decisions he makes is for the love he has for Nanoka other is to against the feeling he has for Nanoka (its hilarious, and heart crushing at the same time) ... and for this its worth watching alone<br />
I wont spoil anything so I wont go into detail about particular points in the anime the above paragraph is enough ....<br />
NOW for Nanoka she is more reserved and mature about her feelings and expressing them( funnily she is also 12 years younger but this could be a girl thing to and nanoka personality allows her to be more in control of herself compared to her brother) ... <br />
I would like to mention the voices of the school girls especially Nanoka was SPOT ON ... Finally school girls that SOUND like proper school girls ... NOT like some over the top fanboy spice girls wanna be actresses DAMN this alone was so REFRESHING ....<br />
p.s. I don&#039;t accept incest .... I believe it to be wrong but that aside this has to be one of the better structured doomed romances that I&#039;ve seen in anime in a long time plus the story is so mature, so honestly made with SO many TWIST Turns and discoveries from various characters and you keep asking yourself &quot;so what is he going to do from here&quot;? .... <br />
my heart was broken when watching this, so sad to see someone fall so low yet because he was in love ... damn <br />
so why did I NOT give this a 10/10 ... well ... the ending that&#039;s why .... what kind of ending was that? I don&#039;t want to spoil anything but Nothing concluded !!! and I personally hate non conclusive ends, ack ... you will have to put up with it though just to watch the drama ... have a nice day thanks for reading<br />
