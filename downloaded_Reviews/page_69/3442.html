    Sekirei is targeted at male audience, viewers who dislike ecchi/harem anime should look elsewhere. Likewise, those who love fan service should give Sekirei a try. It contains all the &amp;quot;ripped up clothes&amp;quot; scenes, &amp;quot;censored panty&amp;quot; shots, &amp;quot;semi-bare breasts&amp;quot;, etc. You will not be disappointed.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that while the show does follow the manga quite closely for the most part, the ending of the anime does deviate from the manga a bit.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Are you familiar with Fate/stay Night? If you are please continue reading this paragraph, if not skip to the next. Upon reading the synopsis, you may find Sekirei&#039;s plot to be very similar.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7600">
        In fact, to sum it up in a nutshell, the major difference is that instead of 8 servants fighting each other, this time we have 108 seikirei instead. But rather than only having 1 servant to fight for the master, in the Sekirei world, the master can have as many seikirei as he/she can get.<br />
<br />
For those who are not familiar with Fate/stay Night, Sekirei is about a battle royal between 108 artificially made life forms (disguised as mostly female, though there are some male as well). These life forms, known as sekirei, are to find their Ashikabi (humans with special genes that allows them to partner with sekirei) and fight for them.<br />

The quality of the animation is great as it is done by Seven Arcs, whose work includes the Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise and Inukami!. Everything flows pretty smoothly and characters are drawn in detail, though sadly the show is not broadcast in HD. <br />
<br />
There are occasional scenes that, when compared with the manga&#039;s artwork, the level is plainly a grade lower. Hence for those who actually appreciate artist&#039;s drawing, I recommend try reading the manga as well.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OP and ED are very well rated by most viewers due to the talented casts of seiyu singing them. Talking about seiyu, one should be able to recognize a few names right away. Just to quickly name a few:<br />
<br />
Kazehana voiced by Yukana Nogami (C.C. in Code Geass, Teletha Testarossa in Full Metal Panic, etc)<br />
Tsukiumi voiced by Inoue Marina (Yoko Ritona in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, etc)<br />
Asama Miya voiced by Oohara Sayaka (Milly Ashford in Code Geass, Alicia Florence in Aria the Animation, etc)<br />
Matsu voiced by Endou Aya (Sheryl Nome in Macross Frontier, Lena Sayers in Mai-Otome 0~S.ifr~, Kinue Crossroad in Gundam 00, etc)<br />
Karasuba voiced by Paku Romi (Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist, Hitsugaya in Bleach, etc)<br />
<br />
etc...you get the point<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, this talented casts of seiyu was one of the major selling point for Sekirei (beside fan service of course).<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Many characters tend to be under developed for the most part of the story (this is usually the case when there&#039;s half a dozen &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; characters and only a dozen episodes to talk about them). As the series approach the ending, we see quite a lot more development for the main casts, particularly Minato (the male protagonist) and his sekirei. It is also interesting to note that the relationship between Minato and his sekirei throughout the series also provided a lot of entertainment, but more often than not these don&#039;t contribute much to character developments.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I enjoyed the series very much. Each episode has its own comedy to laugh at and at the same time it still contain enough action and drama to make the overall story attractive enough to me glued to the screen episode after episode. Definitely worth spending your time on.

    It doesn’t take a genius to look at the anime page for Sekirei and have a pretty good idea what you are getting yourself into.  But I have a weakness for such shows regardless how silly, played out, and clichéd they usually are.  I have to say though that with Sekirei I was pleasantly surprised with the results.<br />
<br />
The basic premise for Sekirei was interesting to me.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of the action movie Highlander, only with tits and asses.  The setting is a town in Japan controlled by the massive MBI cooperation.  They are administering

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19301">
        a &quot;game&quot; of sorts which pits 108 mysterious girls (and a few boys) called Sekirei against one another in a battle in which only one will get the prize.  Each of the Sekirei binds themselves to a human called an Ashikabi with a kiss which grants them extra powers.  There can be only one... giant pair of boobies.<br />
<br />
Sekirei does a good job of combining a lot of different genres together and making it work.  Action and fighting anime mixed with harem romance and comedy and a healthy dose of supernatural magic.  It manages to work quite well and despite being a short series there is enough of everything to keep fans entertained.  Though the series doesn’t wrap up the main storyline it ends with an announcement of a second season.  This is good because quite a few unanswered questions remain at the end.  The pacing of the plot is good and it keeps you interested and never feels like its dragging along or becoming repetitive.  It doesn’t always stay on topic but I never found myself minding that much when it didn’t.  Unexpectantly I really did enjoy the harem aspect of the story.  This was one of the few series in which I liked the entire group of girls.  It also may be the only time I wouldn’t mind if there is never a romantic choice between them and the male lead.  They all work so well together and have so much chemistry that I really just think they all belong together.<br />
<br />
The cast overall is a bit mixed but for the most part very good.  It is brought down mainly by an uninspired and uninteresting lead in Minato.  He is your classic harem lead and I really fail to understand why the girls in the cast find him so damn interesting.  It’s not that he’s an unlikable guy, because he is but he is very unoriginal and doesn’t stand out.  Viewers are unlikely to think much of him other than to wish they were in his place.  Besides spouting clichés and acting holier than thou he contributes nothing to the plot other than to be saved by his busty harem.<br />
<br />
It’s the harem though that saves the series for me.  I really loved them all, they were hilarious together and while none of them are inspired characters from an originality standpoint they just matched each other so well that they were a lot of fun.  Musubi is the ditsy and airheaded fighter who really just cares about the competition.  Her personality provides for a lot of comedy and a whole lot of fan service.  Early on in the story you would say she was the main love interest and while she may turn out to be that in the end she kind of became just one of the girls by the middle portions of the show.  I didn’t mind this so much because the rest of the girls were fun as well.  Tsukiume is the main rival for Minato&#039;s affections with Musubi.  She’s the resident tsundere so of course I loved her immediately.  Like most tsundere characters it seems she underwent the most growth in personality so I felt like I was rooting for her.  Misato stars as the perverted and geeky glasses girl.  She takes more of a backseat with the romance but her personality is more for laughs.  Of course a harem wouldn’t be complete without a loli, Kusano.  Despite me not liking loli&#039;s much I have to admit Kuu was pretty damn lovable and impossible to hate.<br />
<br />
The rest of the supporting cast and villains is solid but not particularly deep.  Everyone’s favorite is likely to be Miya, the landlady of the house they all live in together.  She’s a bit of a mysterious character in her origins but she acts a bit like a teacher, combat trainer, and a mother.  But dont tell her that or she’ll make a scary aura appear.  Other Ashikabi and their Sekirei appear over the course of the story, some to help and others to fight against our heroes and heroines.  We only get a small taste of the main villains which mostly serve to tease the next season.  Other supporting characters like Uzume and Homura remain mostly clouded in mystery and set for larger roles in the future.<br />
<br />
Artistically I can’t say I like Sekirei.  This is not to say the animation and art is bad, because it’s not.  Sekirei really puts the service in fan service and its uncensored version rivals pretty much any other show in terms of its nudity and panty shots.  My main problem though is the unrealistic and silly body measurements and character designs.  The boobs are outrageously huge on practically every non-loli character and really not even that attractive to look at.  They are unrealistically shaped and this is important because you are going to see them ALOT!  Additionally the girls’ bodies are completely malformed with huge hips and asses and tiny waists.  Often characters, particularly Musubi look practically deformed.  It really takes away from the show as I dont think it was necessary.  Dial it down a couple of cup sizes into at least a feasible size range.  The magic and fighting special effects are pretty good though but there are far less of them then there are nipple shots.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the music and voice performances.  I felt the OP/EN theme songs which were performed by the cast were cute and captured the spirit of the series.  Of the seiyuu, I really liked Marina Inoue and Saori Hayama as Tsukiume and Musubi.  They really brought out their respective characters and stole the show.<br />
<br />
Looking back I shouldn’t really have liked this series as much as I did.  It’s not remarkable in any aspect except just being entertaining.  If your dont like harems and over the top fan service then you should stay away from this.  However if you have a boob fetish, love service anime, or like fighting anime then Sekirei will probably be an enjoyable experience.<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
Sekirei is an anime that has never been a critical darling! However, my good buddy convinced me to ignore all the critics and give this series a shot. Unfortunately...I kind of have to agree with the popular consensus on this one. Sekirei has enough problems to make it very hard for me to recommend.<br />
<br />
Plot and characters:<br />
<br />
The plot of Sekirei is that some hot alien chicks crash landed on Earth and an evil corporation is forcing them to pair up with bland males to act as their “masters” and fight each other to the death in a Battle Royale tournament with the winners getting to ascend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193771">
        into Godhood. If only I hadn’t seen so many highly similar plots in other shitty anime like: Akikan, Kampfer, Future Diary, etc. It must be said that Sekirei is not exactly going to win any awards for its creativity. Each of these alien girls called “Sekirei” have different “types” that determine which techniques they can learn and how well they match up against other types based on elemental strengths and weaknesses. Funny, this seems AWFULLY familiar from somewhere! The main character is Minato, who is supposed to be a lovable loser kind of guy that has failed twice getting into Tokyo University and is now studying hard to finally succeed. Seriously! That’s just how little this series tries in terms of creativity. Although I wouldn’t say he is a complete Keitaro from Love Hina ripoff because Keitaro didn’t keep a harem of female slaves that he fought to the death in gladiator matches. I guess Minato is more like Keitaro mixed with Calvin Candie from Django Unchained?! The first Sekirei that Minato gains mastery over is a “fighting type” Sekirei named Musubi. Predictably, Musubi is an airheaded bimbo that lacks any interesting character traits. She loves to eat, flash her tits, and punch other Sekirei in the face. That’s really about as far as her character development goes. My favorite character is the mad scientist leader of the corporation controlling the Sekirei. He is so bombastic and over the top that he actually made me laugh on several occasions, especially in the English dub where he is played by Chuck Huber.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The animation in Sekirei is decent and some of the fight scenes look pretty good relative to its year of release. However, I wasn’t a fan of the character designs. The tits are so absurdly large that it just looks fucking stupid! Sekirei’s idea of human anatomy clashed hard with my personal aesthetics.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Sekirei actually did have a few moments that were genuinely funny, or at least so incredibly stupid that I laughed. In one scene, Musubi randomly starts flying and takes Minato into the air to spoof the romance scene from the 1978 Superman film…then she announces that she has no idea how to land and they fall hundreds of feet before crashing into a tree. The fight scenes as mentioned above in the art section are fairly decent and if you simply want to watch some entertaining garbage, this series is passable. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Sekirei is not what I would consider a good anime by any stretch. However, it never annoyed me to the degree that Akikan and Kampfer did or infuriate me by being horribly written, yet taking itself dead seriously like Future Diary or Code Geass. Basically, Sekirei is a bad anime, but there are a LOT of anime I hate WAY more than Sekirei! Still, I would avoid this one unless you really want to see some mindless entertainment featuring impossibly busty Pokemon women fighting each other for the sake of a highly cliche&#039; and contrived plot.<br />

    I don&#039;t know why people ask me to review harem anime. Yes, I&#039;ve found a few that I liked, but most of them are heavily misogynistic and treat the women like prizes to be won or vapid automatons that have been programmed to chase after this one very ordinary guy regardless of how he treats them or how obviously he rejects them. Who knows, maybe my general distaste for the genre makes people want reviews to see if their particular one will be one of the exceptions or maybe it&#039;s a case of people wanting to see me tear an anime a new one and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review112569">
        they figure a harem title has a good chance of filling that role. The series was created by the manga artist, Gokurakuin Sakurako or Sakura Ashika. An artist best known for her shounen ai. The anime adaptation was handled by Seven Arcs, the studio behind Inukami, which was bad and Mahou Shoujp Lyrical Nanoha, which was good. Let&#039;s take a look at Sekirei and see if it&#039;s one of those rare good harem anime or one of the many that isn&#039;t even remotely worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Our story begins with a ronin named Minato who&#039;s just failed to get into University for the second year in a row. As he&#039;s walking down the street a girl, Musubi, falls on top of him. She&#039;s being chased by lightning hurling twins. She grabs Minato and runs. It turns out she&#039;s a Sekirei, a being with super powers that are fully activated by kissing an Ashikabi, which is the title for their masters. The idea is that a hundred and eight of these beings will fight until one is left to claim the ascension prize. The story from there primarily focuses on the various Sekirei that flock to Minato. Just about everything in the series is pretty typical for a harem series. The only real exception is the powered being battle which, as the only potentially interesting element, is pushed into the background. Plus, the execution for what they do have of it is crap. Get this, one of the rules is that Ashikabi are forbidden to mention the Sekirei plan to outsiders, and yet you see the Sekirei fight out in the open where anyone can see them by walking by, opening a window installing a security camera or through various other means. And yet this is supposed to be a secret. That goes past Twilight and to All Star Batman and Robin levels of stupidity. The humour is another element that fails. Sekirei does have an occasional funny joke, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand, assuming a normal number of fingers. The ending is absolute rubbish. They set up for a sequel while having a pandering, arbitrary triumphant moment. The worst aspect of the work as a whole is the absolutely vile treatment of the female characters. They&#039;re quite strongly objectified right down to having masters who can, quite literally, claim them whether they like it or not. This is probably the best example of internalised misogyny I&#039;ve ever seen. <br />
<br />
The characters are about as nuanced and developed as tissue paper. They&#039;re fully typical for what you almost always see in bad harem anime. You have the ordinary protagonist with no special attributes who you&#039;re supposed to root for because he&#039;s a generically &quot;good&quot; character. The perky and air-headed girl. The more aggressive girl. The loli (ewww) and so on. You will never find a real woman who acts like any of these characters, but they&#039;re designed to appeal to incredibly shallow and hormonal men so... mission accomplished?<br />
<br />
The artwork in this could be generic, but there are several factors that bring it down. The first, and most obvious, being the absurd fan-service. Expect a lot of random panty, ass and breast shots. The fight scenes would be good, but they have the same problem as the action sequences in Highschool of the Dead and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimou, they like to break up the action with fan-service scenes and use the fight scenes as a flimsy excuse to strip the protagonists. Sekirei, stop being stupid. No one is going to do that in a fight. You&#039;re going to aim for causing injuries, not ripping someone&#039;s clothes. The only way you&#039;re going to go for someone&#039;s clothes in an actual fight is if they&#039;ve got loose bits that you can use to pull the person to the ground or to hinder their mobility. The backgrounds are largely dull too. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect great vocal performances in this. It&#039;s almost certainly a case of dull, uninspired characters having voice actors who are good, but can&#039;t add depth where the script calls for none. And the problem certainly isn&#039;t the actors. You&#039;ve got Hayami Saori (who was good in both Ano Hana and Sasameki Koto), Inoue Marina (who was good in Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Strikers) but if I give examples of good performances for every voice actor this&#039;ll be exceedingly long. The point to take away from this little exercise is that the actors are capable, their performances in this are just bad. The music is the best part of the series. It isn&#039;t good, it isn&#039;t even mediocre, but it&#039;s not bad. <br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some decidedly yuri moments in this. <br />
<br />
Sekirei is terrible. The story is largely typical harem schlock and the atypical element has been done by several, vastly superior anime. The characters are a joke, the treatment of the female characters as objects to be collected is appalling. The sheer idiocy of several of the elements is headache inducing and the fan-service is just ridiculous. I will give it some credit for it&#039;s few funny moments and occasional good action sequence, but they certainly aren&#039;t worth sitting through the rest of the series to get to. Final rating 2/10. I just hope the next thing on my review request queue is better. Let me see... Sekirei: Pure Engagement. Insert as many expletives here as you like, it probably won&#039;t be enough. I&#039;m going to take a couple hours to read Gail Simone before moving on to that, but expect the review next week.

    Can you believe what they&#039;re doing with the pokemon franchise these days? I mean I know the games are getting stale but jeez Nintendo, I didn&#039;t think they would go down the fanservice road by turning the pokemon into big boobie bouncing girls that blindly follow their masters... Oh, hold on, this isn&#039;t pokemon, it&#039;s just another generic harem ecchi show.<br />
<br />
STORY: College drop out boy meets a cute boobilicious girl and proceeds to move into a dorm with other girls of different shapes and sizes, and also begins his quest after catching his first Sekirei to become a master or something... Okay that&#039;s all I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48203">
        got, the &quot;Oh it&#039;s exactly like those other things&quot; joke are lazy tiresome and a bit repetitive, but anime like this is exactly what it should only get and deserve.<br />
<br />
And Sekirei is absolutely nothing different from any ecchi anime you&#039;ll see, lazy characterizations? Check! Clueless and borderline retarded female lead? Check! Female lead devoting herself to the main male lead for, no joking about this here, no reason at all and despite they only just met? You know it...<br />
But, the gimmick this time to get you interested in the tittie show is this is like pokemon, as the Sekirei practiably act like mindless tools for battle and follow their master&#039;s demands as this ecchi anime is also a generic action anime, you know, the kind that only clothes take damage (There clothes should only be treated as a health bar before they &quot;faint&quot; apparently). Not that it&#039;s a terrible idea or anything, but there is an obvious marketing underside to the idea, as the girl just love to repeat what type of Sekirei they are. I&#039;m the fighting type! I&#039;m the fire type! etc, etc...<br />
<br />
The girls range from all kinds of sizes, you got you perfect woman build, the ridiculous proportioned ones, and even a loli so no pervert is left out, as there&#039;s enough for all. As character&#039;s go... The main lead is too generic to even care about, even his name escapes me (I know I can just look it up on wiki or something but why should I if generic hero of ecchi anime is a more suitable name?)  and the lead female or pokemon-Sekirei whatever has the IQ of half her breast size in centimeters, so there&#039;s no dodging the &quot;oops, I saw your panties&quot; jokes or &quot;OMG, you&#039;re naked!&quot; routines, even we get full frontial boobs in this one, but just like any other ecchi, is nothing more than cock teasing to point of saying, &quot;Why isn&#039;t this just a hentai?&quot;<br />
<br />
All Sekirei manages to do is kill brain cells and empty wallets, well until the next tit anime comes along, and if you&#039;re the type to fall for it, then more power to you, because it least you&#039;re fueling one of the bigger budget anime producers, Aniplex, and maybe they&#039;ll use the money to make more Fate/whatevers or other colored Exorcists so that they can market something not as completely bland as this.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION: At least... The animation is fine, action scenes are good and the titties are... well, bouncing, so that&#039;s all that should matter anyway for anime like this.<br />
<br />
SOUND: I can&#039;t remember, it&#039;s forgettable to the point of amnesia. Didn&#039;t watch the japanese version as much as the english version, and I did check out Funimation&#039;s dub and it&#039;s underwhelming, but even Funimation knew that the effort of a good dub would be unfitting for this anime. Chuck Huber is in it as a type-casted professor so at least that&#039;s kind of a treat.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
The Good:<br />
+ If you&#039;re in it for titties, more power to ya.<br />
+ Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;re animated quite nicely.<br />
<br />
Mixed:<br />
+/- A decent idea / A gimmick used for easier marketing.<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
- About as deep as every generic harem you&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
- No memorable character, retard main female lead.<br />
- Forgettable audio, both english and japanese audio are just as lazy.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not trying to talk shit here, and I know I didn&#039;t really give this anime a chance (Though I can get enough information from watching two episodes to write a review speaks volumes of how truly little there is offered in this anime in terms of everything but titties) and of course it&#039;s only about the titties and it&#039;s redundant to criticize the show for it, but this is almost insulting, but if you really want to watch this, try watching it with a few friends and have a blast cracking pokemon references or even do your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary with this show, that&#039;s probably the best way to get through this the non-shameless way instead of beating off to this.

    Sekirei starts out with your typical pathetic male---couldn&#039;t get into college, no close friends, no girlfriend, or any hope at all for anything good to happen in the near future l...until that one fateful day. :P<br />
<br />
Story - Pretty generic, yet unique at the same time if that makes any sense whatsoever. Like I said, you&#039;ve got your typical &amp;quot;down in the dumps&amp;quot; male, Minato, who feels like all is lost after not making it into college, but then he meets this girl who instantly connects with him. The girl turns out to be what is called a Sekirei and now Minato is involved in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7944">
        game known as the Sekirei Plan. 108 Sekirei have been let loose throughout the city, each looking for someone they adore (technical term &#039;Ashikabi&amp;quot;). After most of them have found their Ashikabi, the game sets into a new development which will cause all of the Sekirei to battle with the winner receiving a prize. That prize is that the Sekirei will be able to live with their Ashikabi forever. However, judging from how the series is going, it doesn&#039;t look like we&#039;ll see any of that Sekirei Plan game in action this season (assuming they make a second season). Anyway, the good part about the story is the fact that each Ashikabi isn&#039;t limited to one Sekirei, so it&#039;ll obviously lead to some funny moments when the Sekirei fight over their Ashikabi. However, sometimes I wish that the main character, Minato, would show a little more affection as to the Sekirei he likes instead of trying to treat them all equally. =/ <br />
<br />
Art &amp;amp; Sound - The artwork isn&#039;t bad, but the females are all generally the same with a few exceptions...big breasted with long hair (with the exception being their personalities). :P The sound isn&#039;t bad either, although the OP and ED songs aren&#039;t particularly the greatest out there.<br />
<br />
Character - Well, you&#039;re bound to like someone from the show since all of the Sekirei have a unique personality. There are a lot to choose from which would make anyone enjoy the show somewhat. The development could have gone a bit smoother, if you could even pick out any development in the series, but it isn&#039;t that bad. Having a favorite character will definitely increase the chance of enjoying the show. :P<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Well, I really like it for some odd reason. I have my favorite Sekirei (Tsukiumi), pairings I like better than others, as well as the anticipation to see what will happen next. It really comes down to if you like Ecchi, Harem, Romance series if you ask me. The action part of the show is practically a bonus for me. With that said, I, personally, really enjoy Sekirei. <br />
<br />
Overall, Sekirei is an interesting anime that will hopefully have a second season to touch base on the actual storyline of the Sekirei Plan.

    Sekirei is a great anime if u love ecchi first of all.It doesnt get much better then this. Almost all of the girls in the show have giant boobs that hang out or show major cleavage. Also they almost all have really short skirts that show panties in action scenes, or panties flash out of the blue. The male main character gets alot of attention from his Sekirei(really hot girls) that make this hot too. The thing that I think makes Sekirei awesome, though is that unlike most ecchi anime, it actuall has an awesome plot and it has awesome action and fighting. Each girl

    Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person it&#039;s not very easy for me.<br />
<br />
Wow!! I&#039;m surprise. I&#039;m not a &quot;harem with overload of fanservice&quot; fan, having be introduce to a lot of crappy show in that context by friends *cough*rosario-vampire*cough**cough*to-love-Ru*cough*. I watch this anime cauze I heard a lot of good comment about it. So here&#039;s my review...<br />
<br />
Story: You have twelve episodes to tell a good serie and sekirei had done this part almost perfectly. Cauze in that kind of show, usually, you don&#039;t have a big original story. The stories are classic being concentrated to provide what I call &quot;overload of fanservice in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16993">
        every aspect&quot;( if you understand what I mean by &quot;aspect&quot;). This show broke a little bit of those rules by adding a story who has some good moment. Despite the fact that almost every character has oversized-boobs, the fanservice is everywhere, but they don&#039;t exagerated things, witch I think was the good move to made. Sure, there&#039;s always people who will complain about being a stupid show and I respectfully disagree. I&#039;ll explain later in the other segement. <br />
Story: 8/10 for providing a &quot;descent&quot; story for a twelve episodes show.<br />
<br />
Art: Amazing. The character are really well draw and animeted. I think there&#039;s some character art that are very original and beautiful. I&#039;m not gonna go so far in the art, cauze I&#039;m not very good to explain every single good things about it. <br />
Art: 9/10<br />
<br />
Sound: Here&#039;s where I&#039;m feeling more ngh. The music is typically not so good in those shows at least in my opinion, but I can undersand the choice of music and the opening doesn&#039;t scare the crap out of me *cough*to-love-Ru second opening*cough*. <br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
Character: Wow!! Once again, twelve episode show. I didn&#039;t expect to have huge character developpement in that kind of context, but at least some characters had there own personnality and you can understand almost everybody why there doing this and that. Minato never became annoying like I don&#039;t know...heu...*cough*Aono Tsukune*cough*. Musubi was a hot-blooded character witch I think was funny and a good move to put that. Tsukiumi was my favorite character ( and no, it&#039;s not because of her huge breast). I think she had the classic &quot;I don&#039;t need those inferior person&quot; syndrome and finally she need her Ashikabi more than everyone else, but the way it&#039;s handle is perfect and at that time, this can became annoying and it never does. <br />
Character: 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyement: God what&#039;s wrong with me!! I ENJOY THE SHOW!! Me, mecha-fan, there&#039;s must be something wrong in my mind. Verification: I still love Gundam, yes or no... yes...ouf... No seriously, I think it&#039;s an awesome ride and... well that&#039;s it... nothing more, nothing less, &quot;ENJOYABLE&quot;!! Enjoyement: 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall: I&#039;m gonna remember that show for a long time. Because I&#039;m someone who search for spectacular story with something we never saw before, and the show has some flaws (like every show does) I can&#039;t give more than eight, but if your a &quot;harem&quot; fan or someone who simply love anime in general, take a detour on that show, it&#039;s worth watching and not necessarily very long.<br />
Overall: 8/10

    Sekirei truly suprised me. I started watching it just thinking it was going to be a pure fanservice show with a bad story (Like Queen&#039;s Blade lol) but instead I got a very enjoyable adventure. This is my first review here so I&#039;ll break each section down.<br />
<br />
Story (8)<br />
I was expecting poor plot but instead I got a story that actually really managed to get me involved. Sekirei are basically superpowered chicks and a couple of pretty boys. They select a human to form a bond with in order to bring out their full power. These humans are called Ashikabi&#039;s and for the most part seem

        to be clueless guys lol. The main idea is that there&#039;s a tournament that all 108 of the Sekirei will be competing in. The winner will get to stay with their Ashikabi forever. It seems simple enough but a lot of things happen that spice the story up.<br />
<br />
Art (7)<br />
I have mixed feelings about the art because it tends to change from time to time. Some scenes look excellent while others look like they&#039;re from a diffrent show. This doesn&#039;t happen enough to make me dislike the art though.<br />
<br />
Sound (6)<br />
I&#039;m fairly neutural when it comes to the sound. The voice acting is pretty good but the music&#039;s a bit feminine for my taste. There&#039;s nothing really wrong with that, I just wish there was more kick ass action songs lmao.<br />
<br />
Character (9)<br />
This is where Sekirei really shines. The characters are all unique and it&#039;s practically impossible to not find someone you like. The only reason I don&#039;t give the characters a perfect score is because Minato and Musubi are the least interesting of all. That could be a problem for some people since they&#039;re the main characters. On the other hand others tend to like them so it&#039;s all a matter of opinion. Tsukiumi&#039;s my favorite because I love her attitude and her powers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8)<br />
It&#039;s a very amusing show. Anyone with a sense of humour will be laughing every other minute as they watch this. The action scenes are also relaly good for the most part. I just wish they had fleshed out some of the background characters a little bit more.<br />
<br />
Overall (8)<br />
Anyone who doesn&#039;t like fanservice should beware because there&#039;s plenty. It is one of the better one&#039;s however because they actually work the fanservice into the plot. All in all Sekirei&#039;s a solid anime that I&#039;ll probably end up buying on dvd.

    Sekirei is a pretty simple straight foward love-romance ecchie harem anime if you like that stuff then you will love this show if you dont then you will hate it.<br />
I like it because im all for the 4 women likeing 1 dude and trying to out do each other for his love. I also like how the story is simple and easly understood and the fact that all the women are really hot with big brest and short skirts doesnt hurt. <br />
<br />
Ok i know this review might not be the best but this was the first time I have ever done a review so please

    This is the other type of animes (besides gory and bloody animes) that I often most likely feel like watching. This is an action-echi-comedy anime. It&#039;s like any other you&#039;ve watched (for instance Tenjou Tenge, Ikkitousen) but this one has a more &quot;pokemon-cath &#039;em style&quot; theme if you know what I mean. I will include full descriptions in this review because I feel that even if I spoil the story or other stuff you will enjoy this anime not because of the story specifically. Also this anime has, halfway through, explicit content, specifically: nudity. So it&#039;s not suitable for underage audiences. <br />
<br />
The story is pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12298">
        much straight forward as for any of this echi animes. You know: a somewhat failure type of guy is deppressed all over something and then when he is walking home he get&#039;s to meet a really beautiful girl that cames out of nowhere and just after that the girl, for whatever reason, get&#039;s to stay in the guy&#039;s house&quot;. The twist is that this girl is one of the &quot;Sekireis&quot; that the worldwide famous MBI company has let out to provoke a &quot;Battle Royale&quot; scenario between the sekireis in the city called &quot;New Tokyo&quot;. Now this girls have a wide range of super powers (water, fire, psychical, etc.) and fight in order to get their wish of being with the person they love forever come true. <br />
<br />
This girls need to &quot;be winged&quot; in order to be able to use their full power, they do this by mixing their DNA with a human&#039;s DNA: by kissing. Now the story is set just in a like 10 year gap from the present (2019 or something like that). So most of the stuff you see on the enviroment is as just realistic as watching it anywhere else for real. Another thing that I did found different in this anime compared with others of this genre (le&#039;s take Ikkitousen and Tenjou Tenge) is the reason behind the fights. In Ikkitousen they just fight to &quot;fullfill the destiny of the magatama&quot; in &quot;Tenjou Tenge there is really no reason at all xD! Here you&#039;ve got better and realistic event that causes the fighting to begin.<br />
<br />
This is a Seven Arcs artistic produccion so it&#039;s obviously very good. The design  of the backgrounds and specially the characters is superb. The characters are very nice to watch in action and the animation doesn&#039;t miss almost any amount of detail in fight sequences. The space of action get&#039;s it&#039;s great dose of originality as well. The locations are often destroyed nicely and when that happens it&#039;s does looks realistic and it does leave a chaotic-satisfactory feeling. Another thing this anime has to deal with is the fan service issue. Yes this anime shows almost all sekireis as big breasted babes, of course there are exceptions but that is the main idea. This babes are vey teasing and seductive from time to time, so expect some hardcore echi escenes.  But even so respecting looks every single one of the characters is different from one another by some characteristic features, even so the overall body type is the same. The characters are drawn so well that you see that they are completely different in some way or another.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t got much to say about to say about the sound. The opening and ending themes are a bit gilrlish, but then again it all comes down if they fit the theme or not, well.. at the end they do. Voice acting is a important factor in an anime too. Well in here the voice acting is superb: love Tsukiumi&#039;s voice (love everything about her really) and Karasuba&#039;s as well (lol the voice talent is the same as Hitsugaya Toushirou and Elric Edward). The sound is nice and complements this anime making it a great listening experience.<br />
<br />
Now the characters are amazing and have very different behaviors. I&#039;m in love with the beautiful blond, short-tempered and violent Tsukiumi, I fancy the peaceful, determined and voluptuous Musubi and definitely want the perverted, seductive and smart Matsu. Even the secondary characters or just those that only appear in one or two episodes have a great amount of detail respecting looks and personality so you&#039;ll be willing to see more of those characters even if they don&#039;t show up anymore on the storyline. You will definitely feel symphaty for the vast majority of the cast and even get attached to them.<br />
<br />
If there is something perfect about this anime, leaving aside the artistic design, I&#039;ve got to say that the enjoyment impact that acomplishes on the viewer is somewhat different from another aspects this anime offers. The enjoyment factor is high quality and I don&#039;t know about other people but I&#039;m really anxious and looking forward for the OVA and the second season. Why? Well because I did greatly enjoy it. If you are not a echi fan and are only used to watch animes with elaborate stories and difficult scripts then definitely this one is not for you, as you will see the story as lame and with no sense at all. But if you&#039;re looking for fun, great, sexy looking characters and no great complications in storyline issues then this is one anime you should seriously considering watching.<br />

This is obviously a ecchi fanservice harem anime. That much is glaringly self-evident. I have no problem with that genre, honest, but this anime was not for me. I dropped it after seeing more than half of it, but I know the rest of the plot by reading spoilers.<br />
<br />
I noticed that a reviewer named &quot;Chasekun&quot; compared Sekirei to Fate/stay night. All I have to say in response to that is...<br />
<br />
 &quot;Are you nuts?! Have you actually SEEN Fate/stay night before, Chasekun?!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two couldn&#039;t be more different. While, yes, there is a very superficial similarity in the &quot;Masters/Ashikabi with Servants/Sekirei&quot; dynamic and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review53503">
        there is fighting between Servants/Sekirei. But that&#039;s it. Fate/stay night is far, far deeper and much more thought-provoking, especially the original visual novel— the anime adaptation is quite lackluster in comparison to the VN, but even the anime of Fate/stay night has much more substance to it than Sekirei. Interesting and well-developed characters and actual character development, dynamic plot (the VN actually has three different routes/stories each with multiple paths), actually well-thought-out mechanics for things like magic (this reviewer thinks so, anyways), etc.; I could go on but that isn&#039;t the point of this review. <br />
<br />
Sekirei, on the other hand...<br />
<br />
Story: Poor. There&#039;s not really much of a story here when you look past the feeble attempts at establishing a plot. It&#039;s pretty much exactly what is written (or rather, drawn) on the box. As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read in other reviews, it&#039;s basically an excuse to have 100+ super-powered chicks duke it out—oh, two or three of the Sekirei are bishounen instead. The story is written to basically allow for the premise of &quot;big titty aliens with superpowers in a battle harem, inexplicably having fallen in love with a completely unremarkable spineless loser (lol, only in anime can this happen), beating the crap out of other big titty aliens with superpowers for an arbitrary reason&quot;. That may seem harsh, but it&#039;s literally what the story is when you sift through all the padding put in place to make it seem like there is actually something there.<br />
<br />
Art: Mediocre. I&#039;m kind of spoiled by series with far better artwork now, though, so I&#039;m not impressed, can&#039;t help that. Also, I tend to like more realism in character designs, rather than the style of &quot;impossibly wide hips, huge butts, and massive boobs&quot;. Also, there is something about their faces that just feels wrong to me... I think it&#039;s the eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound: Fair. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Voices are decent, at least in the Japanese version (I&#039;m not sure if there is a dubbed version of this yet, nor am I really inclined to find out). Essentially, nothing I didn&#039;t already expect, but that isn&#039;t a bad thing, exactly.<br />
<br />
Character: Poor. Characters are pretty much static cliches meant to be the carriers of tropes commonly seen in harem anime. Let&#039;s see... the main male character is more of a pathetic weenie than Keitaro of Love Hina, and not even nearly as noticeable or amusing as him; he&#039;s just sort of... there. Main female character is... hmm, &quot;empty headed&quot; is the best way to describe her; she&#039;s one of those vapid &quot;I don&#039;t have &#039;common sense&#039; so I sound like a moron when I ask questions about things that should be self-evident to any normal person&quot; types. After her we have a scary onee-san landlady (probably one of the most interesting characters in the story), psuedo-playboy but not really bishounen Sekirei, amiable tomboy lesbian sekirei (also one of the most interesting characters, and not because she&#039;s lesbian, mind you), lazy pervert bum guy and his twin tsundere lightning sekirei, token loli sekirei, lecherous old man type big titty hacker sekirei, possessive violent tsundere sekirei, sensual stripper older woman bottle fairy sekirei, bloodthirsty insane sword sekirei, main character&#039;s weird perverted somewhat domineering little sister and her shota dark-is-not-evil sekirei, his domineering smoker researcher mom, batshit crazy mega-corporation head, and many more largely irrelevant characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Poor. Personally, I prefer stories that are actually substantial and not a flimsy cover for a ecchi fanservice harem situation. I like stories where the characters are actually modeled like real people with dynamic moods and personalities, and not essentially one-dimensional harem tropes designed for the sole purpose of ecchi comedy. I like stories that engage me intellectually and make me think, not mindless perversion barely hidden behind a cobbled-together plot.<br />
<br />
Overall: Decent, actually. While I didn&#039;t finish it, I didn&#039;t exactly hate it. I didn&#039;t like it either. In the end, it does what it set out to do—provide ecchi comedy—pretty well. However, I&#039;m not exactly interested in something lacking this much substance, since I&#039;m a thinking type of guy. Basically? If you want to just sit back, veg, and watch something ecchi that doesn&#039;t require much thought and has lots of girls with big tits and butts? Sekirei is for you. If you want to watch something that actually requires you to pay attention to the story because it has an involved plot, with developed characters? Try something like Fate/stay night (especially the original visual novel, it&#039;s a fantastic read) instead.

    Sekirei has a very obvious harem premise, so caution is required by those who usually dislike this type of anime: 108 creatures, mostly female, spread all over town are to be either willingly or unwillingly &amp;quot;winged&amp;quot; by human masters through the exchange of bodily fluids, most commonly through a kiss, and engage in a battle royale to decide which pair will win and &amp;quot;ascend together unto heaven&amp;quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The plot is linear and simple, a few mysteries are contained as to the identities and motivations of some characters, as well as the true nature of the Sekirei Plan. An interesting aspect of it is the high degree

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8041">
        of faithfulness to the manga it&#039;s derived from, to the point of the viewer, by the end of the series, be able to pick up the subsequent manga volume and read it without major issues.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art doesn&#039;t manage to impress, but the quality is very consistent throughout, and it&#039;s very hard to perceive poorly made moments due to low budget. The battle animations and choreography are, however, better than one would expect from a series of this scope, and it also gives fans who come in from the manga interesting details on each Sekirei&#039;s powers.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The intro and outro songs fit the mood of the content, the background music is good but not outstanding. On the other hand, voice acting is a very catching aspect of it, with a couple higher profile actresses(namely Marina Inoue and Paku Romi, both usually typecast for bold female and young male roles). Since most of the comedy comes from the interaction of the main cast with itself, thiswas a central part of the production which was not overlooked.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
As a typical harem series, most of the humor is derived from the eccentric and fixed personalities of the main characters, and most of the character development focuses on the protagonist, and is quite a small amount. Most of the Sekirei only change their reactions significantly shortly after and during the process of being winged, and remain unchanged after that.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Sekirei is a good series, with a sufficiently fast pace that will keep most people hooked. It&#039;s leaving a lot of fans with hopes for future seasons, even though I personally find the possibility to be unlikely. It offers a small twist to the harem genre having the combat aspects and multiple masters with small harems of their own, and has been likened to Pokemon by many. In the end, a fitting work for it&#039;s short run of 12 episodes.

    Sekirei is actually a pretty generic show in terms of plot, characters, story, and art.  The ecchi and harem aspect can immediately put people off.  With those things in mind, this is by far one of my most favorite hidden gems in anime that i&#039;ve found.<br />
<br />
b-b-b-but you gave its a 7??  Yes i did, that&#039;s b/c the anime isn&#039;t finished; there are two seasons and many rumors about a third.  This is also the first anime that has made me pick up the manga.  If the story were complete, or at least if there were more episodes, this would get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156463">
        a 9 from me.<br />
<br />
Sekirei is about a game played in a large metropolitan city with humanoids (mainly females) having strange abilities that go around battling one another trying to find an ashkabi (mainly male) for them to latch onto and battle for/protect.  Its like a giant battle royal with wild fight scenes and an enormous depth of back story.<br />
<br />
What makes Sekirei unique is how well its executed, the characters, while largely generic fit perfectly with the setting and context of the game, and there are many different types of characters that surround the MC, alot of them are very powerful.  It makes for an exciting dynamic.  The anime is almost a SoL though, as it doesn&#039;t really take off into crazy town until the second season, but i found that it kept me wanting more and more and more.  After each episode the show just got better and better.  the progression was almost perfect.<br />
<br />
There are some drawbacks however, namely the MC is a pussy.  What makes this even slightly tolerable is that there is a very slow progression to his character and while he is often aloof, naive, shy and stuttering, he isn&#039;t a sniveling, groveling weakling that just makes you hate his guts.  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s also a fair amount of ecchi with tits and red faces popping up in almost every episode.  It isn&#039;t Highschool DxD level, but there&#039;s no doubt they are catering to the fanservice crowd.  Thankfully it doesn&#039;t really get in the way, as most of the fanservice scenes serve multiple purposes to further the character development or the plot.<br />
<br />
Even with the individual elements being somewhat generic, the way their are positioned makes the show particularly unique and especially interesting.  I&#039;ve watched my fair share of animu, this is one of those shows that really grabbed my attention from the start and never let me down.  And generic works to make the characters relate-able and interesting early and b/c of this its very easy for them to break their mold and surprise the viewers.<br />
<br />
If you can handle some ecchi and are looking to be thoroughly entertained, can&#039;t do much better than Sekirei, it has a little bit of everything without being overbearing.

    Sekirei is considered by many to be an underrated gem of its genre. It is definitely a classic harem anime in the sense that we know the main character is not going to pick any of the girls due to his demeanor and the circumstances surrounding the plot. I personally dropped this anime after episode 3 the first time I attempted to watch it. However, after a couple months, I came back to it and it has grown on me, very much so.<br />
<br />
For as infamous as this show is for it&#039;s very frequent nudity, big-breasted sex-appeal women, and emphasis on Ecchi, Seikirei does actually have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173291">
        a very fascinating plot and setting which balances out its constant innuendos. The Sekirei concept in itself feels much like a mixture of Pokémon, The Hunger Games, and The Running Man all weaved into one (with a lot of drama and &quot;slice of life&quot; atmosphere thrown in). The plot has a fair amount of good action and enough of an actual story line of depth to yank it from the category of an anime that is &quot;just being an Ecchi for ecchi&#039;s sake&quot; but not enough to make it more about the story either. So it balances itself quite nicely.<br />
<br />
The plot and concept/constructs of the story are nicely thought out and explained adequately as the story unfolds (at some point, a confusion you may be having will always be addressed). The whole concept of the Sekireis, Ashikabis, the Disciplinary Squad, and government structure of the Sekirei project offer a depth that matches many &quot;fair&quot; anime adventure series (I say &quot;fair&quot; because the plot is well-done/laid out, but also isn&#039;t flat-out amazing either).<br />
<br />
Minato Sahashi, the male lead and protagonist, in my opinion, is the show&#039;s weakest point. Much like Yusuke Takasaki from the infamous anime: Green Green (but not AS bad), he is a very tasteless character that kind of just has to be there for the plot&#039;s sake and structure.  By season 2, he grows a small bit and I probably accepted him more than in the first season due to the simple factor of time.<br />
<br />
The Sekirei, for the most part, are what make this anime interesting. Their personality differences as well as their constant fighting to be Minato&#039;s one love, is highly comical and at times, super sweet (when they get a moment to themselves with him).<br />
<br />
For me personally, Musubi and Tsukiumi are my favorite players in this anime drama. They both have very much potential (in my personal opinion) as showing quality traits of girls I personally would love to marry (Musubi more than Tsukiumi). This aspect is definitely one of the more core reasons I like this anime. The loyalty and dedication of Minato&#039;s Sekirei to their Ashikabi, is quite beautiful and romantic/&quot;wifely&quot; if you let it be.  Attaching to a character will definitely help you ride out the entire show MUCH better.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are nothing to write home about but are good enough that they don&#039;t distract from the characters and plot at hand.  The opening theme to both seasons of the show are very well-done in terms of music.<br />
<br />
To conclude, a statement I once heard vulgarly put to describe this show was: &quot;it&#039;s like Pokémon, except with big-titted women.&quot; Though that statement in the raw sense is true, yes....the show is definitely more than that. It isn&#039;t a flat-out amazing show, but most of the characters are quite interesting and you can definitely get attached to them. Overall: Good plot/setting/story, funny comedy, mostly all likable characters (a few I can&#039;t stand), very well-done opening theme song, and exciting super powered action when it&#039;s around. Sekirei is definitely a decent anime for the genre-mix it is trying to be.<br />
<br />
(Warning: Season 2 ends on a &quot;to be continued&quot; cliff-hanger and Season 3 will probably never be created/released to conclude the story, due to a few reasons you can research yourself. With this in mind, just realize that you won&#039;t get closure if you decide to get into this anime.)

    After seeing how so many people gave this a really high rating, I had to review.<br />
First off, this show is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen (the other being Upotte!). <br />
<br />
Story: The story is extremely lame, seeing as it is about a student who cannot get into college who cannot do anything at all (how original). One day, as he is walking through the city, a random girl just happens to land on him in midst of a battle. Thus, the start of a weird &quot;adventure.&quot; One by one, he meets more of these weird girls that become known as Sekirei.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123609">
        Sekirei are forced to fight the other Sekirei in order to prevail victorious in order to spend all of eternity with their Ashikabi, or their loved one.  However, the only thing that really happened was Minato randomly running into new girls, &quot;conquering&quot; them, and thats pretty much it. If you only want to see boobs and other ecchi stuff, I would say shoot for Sekirei. <br />
<br />
Art: The art in my opinion was a little annoying. I hated seeing the character designs as something just didnt feel right about them. Normally, a harem anime (in my opinion) should have at least cute girls in them. The poor designs were just a major pain to watch. <br />
<br />
Sound: Although the voice cast was good, I absolutely couldn&#039;t stand Minato&#039;s voice both in Japanese and the Dubbed version. He sounded so nasaly and useless that it made me want to bang my head on the keyboard repeatedly. The rest of the people sounded very exhausted and not very enthusiastic about the characters. <br />
<br />
Character: It&#039;s something we have seen in almost every harem genre: a useless male lead with many supposedly cute girls fall for him for either his kindness or just random reason. In this case, they love him for his kindness (i think). Each Sekirei have their own ability/ power, such as controlling plants or water. <br />
<br />
I remember when I was watching this, I wondered why I was making myself go through that kind of torture. I literally thought before an episode, &quot;When will this be over?&quot; or &quot;Will i make it through this episode?&quot; <br />
<br />

    I found this anime a great series. It will push people away from showing it in high school, but if you don&#039;t love full echhi this is a nice change from the manga. I loved the overall series because i am a huge elemental fan. If you love elemental animes watch this... it&#039;s a nice change not just seeing the basic ones of fire, water, wind and earth but getting into weapons and items not usually seen... over all just great anime and can&#039;t wait till sekirei 2

    4 minutes in, the plot has already started and fan service is already happening.<br />
If that&#039;s not a great start, I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
People like making fun of Minato for failing the entrance exam, not once, but twice. And his luck just seems to get worse, or is it better? It&#039;s not real clear.<br />
<br />
The Sekirei, mostly girls with abilities who fight each other in secret. Nobody else is allowed to know, besides their partners, called Ashikabi. <br />
There is a lot of fan service, so if you aren&#039;t into that, this probably isn&#039;t for you. It all plays into the story though and meshes well, since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233002">
        that&#039;s one of the paint points of it. <br />
<br />
Musubi is adorable and sexy, she&#039;s so sweet with Minato and the romantic parts between them are really nice. A while later we meet Kusano, who definitely rivals Musubi in cuteness. After that we meet Matsu. She wants Minato all to herself. She&#039;s a little perverted, but if you&#039;re like me, they&#039;re usually my favourite sort of characters. Then finally we meet Tsukiumi. <br />
<br />
The story is really interesting, and if you like Ecchi/fan service, you should definitely check this out.

    Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews here for the big fight! As always I am reviewing the dubbed version though I will admit that I watched the subbed version first, and will be making small comments on differences I noticed between the two. Primarily though, we&#039;re rolling off the dub. I found the title mildly entertaining with some interesting characters, enough for a &#039;well if you&#039;ve got nothing better&#039; recommendation, but far from a &#039;Must Watch Anime&#039; ranking. Some of the concepts are a little convoluted, and with the potential of 108 characters, some cast members get the metaphorical shaft, but it&#039;s still alright. Let&#039;s get this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319758">
        pact in motion!<br />
<br />
Story 6: <br />
Basically the titular Sekirei are aliens/special humans/something *else* that are found in a spaceship like place on a secret island. For reasons not explained, the guy that found them is given authority over them to the point he devises a game where they must all fight each other to the death and the one winner is allowed to stay with her human partner. Oh, and that&#039;s another alien caveat, these Sekirei, to develop their superpowers fully, must be kissed by a human. Though it is shown in the series that it does NOT have to be the case, these humans are supposed to be special to the Sekirei and inspire feelings in them. There are a few humans (ashikabi they are termed) that go around kissing every unclaimed Sekirei they can find, and I cannot believe all of those Sekirei have &#039;feelings&#039; for this &#039;collector&#039;. But in best terms, Sekirei are supposed to find their &#039;destined ones.&#039; <br />
<br />
Now since Japan has a long standing history with the number 108 (the stars of destiny, so on) there are 108 Sekirei. Obviously this would be a LONG show if every single one of them got any focus or screen time at all. Most of them are shown as being defeated and some of them don&#039;t even get their numbers mentioned, leaving us with a far more manageable number of cast members. Here&#039;s where one of my big rubs comes in, especially in the subbed version, but remains annoying in the dub: names. Let&#039;s check some of the character names: Musubi, Matsu, Minato, Miya, Minaka, Mitshua, Mutsu, yeah, ENOUGH WITH THE DAMN &#039;M&#039;s! And a fair amount of them are important characters, the primary Sekirei, the Main Character, and the Main Villain all have &#039;M&#039; names. Was one reason I rewatched the dub, because I couldn&#039;t keep the subtitled names straight. It can be very confusing. <br />
<br />
The second and most obvious issue to deal with is nudity. There are moments of bare breasts throughout the series, and of course they are all the size of Goodyear blimps. I&#039;m not anti-boob by ANY means, I&#039;m actually quite the fan, but this show could have been done without any explicit nippleage (is that a word?) and kept the &#039;sexy&#039; feel. A character that appears late in season one and is prominent in season two is named Kazehana (yes no &#039;M&#039; name!) and she is double stacked. But throughout season one she never once is topless, and I still credit her for having sex appeal. Sometimes not showing the goodies can be as sexy as the full monty, or for sure toplessness. I&#039;m not throwing any derision on any reviewer on this site, but I think that youth and nudity might have meshed together to give this anime a bit higher rating that it might otherwise warrant. I know being middle aged puts me a bit older than the average anime viewer, but at my age, nipples aren&#039;t as mystifying and fun as they used to be. A toning down of the sexual aspects would not have hurt the primary focus of the show (action and fighting) at all. <br />
<br />
The primary thrust of the story is the hapless guy gaining at first one, and then several (because you can&#039;t be an anime protagonist if you ain&#039;t a playa!) Sekirei to rally under his banner. He also like many protagonists, has no real interest in this whole &#039;Sekirei Plan&#039; that the &#039;Game Master&#039; (the guy who found the alien ship way back when) has developed for the creatures to fight to the death. Main Character is just cool hanging with his girls trying to keep them from killing each other, and just living life. The plan is forced on him, as always, and he slowly becomes involved. In fact his involvement even nets him a little like 10 year old Sekirei who can make plants grow (think Poison Ivy level power) who decides he&#039;s her big brother, but fights with the other girls about who his &#039;true&#039; wife is. <br />
<br />
As the plan presses in harder and harder, and it looks like combat is unavoidable, the MC meets another ashikabi with a Sekirei that does not have combat prowess that seeks to flee the city (which is being used as the Sekirei&#039;s battleground, and hence fleeing is forbidden). MC decides, because he&#039;s a cool guy, to help this hapless Sekirei and her guy to get to safety because everyone should have the right to live their lives with the ones they love, right? So they set out to spring those two, and that consumes the second half of the season. Battles will be fought, sacrifices will be made, computers will be hacked, and only time will tell if the lovelorn Sekirei and her ashikabi make it out of town, and subsequently out of the Sekirei Plan (of fighting to the death).<br />
<br />
The action of the show is pretty good, I enjoyed the fights, and the stylings of the fights. The first Sekirei the MC obtains is a fistfighter and she kicks all kinds of ass. He also has one that&#039;s a hacker, who does not fight in any physical sense but has the SWEETEST computer setup in her room. God I&#039;d die for a setup like that! She&#039;s super smart but willing to leave the bunker when the situation calls for it. There&#039;s the little girl I mentioned and her ability to grow and retract plants at will. She&#039;s just adorable, as there is a somewhat sexual connotation in being a Sekirei, and he *does* kiss this little girl, albeit accidentally, and instigated by her, herself, but she&#039;s innocent in all other ways, and doesn&#039;t carry the &#039;vavavoom&#039; that the others do. I was worried at first because....well, I&#039;ve seen things in anime. Terrible things heh.<br />
<br />
Story wise we&#039;re pretty good until the last episode. There&#039;s a twist surrounding the first Sekirei we and the MC meets that doesn&#039;t work very well for me, but it is what it is, and it becomes even more important in season 2 (which we will review later). But other than that, the story is serviceable, if not slightly predictable. I say give it a watch. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I thought everything looked good. The boobs do get out of control here and there, but that&#039;s endemic to damn near every anime with large breasted women. Doubly so if we&#039;re going to see those breasts bare. Every now and then I think I&#039;d like to see an adult rated show where the biggest of the cast is a &#039;C&#039; cup or something, just for a bit of reality. I know anime is fantasy, but not every man&#039;s fantasy is juggs so big they have their own gravity. Believe it or not, some men (and women) take fancy in smaller or even average sized breasts. That&#039;s why porn has everything from blimps to bumps, because what appeals to one person or group doesn&#039;t appeal to them all. Other than my titty rant here, the art was pretty nice. Each Sekirei has a very distinct style, both in &#039;fighting uniform&#039; and in &#039;street clothes&#039;. They are easily identified, and easy to keep up with. There is a Sekirei who is experiencing, let&#039;s say, body changes, and though somewhat subtle, those are easy to notice, but not over done. Tone down the boob blimps, and we&#039;d really be set!<br />
<br />
Sound: 6<br />
HUGE knock here. In the Japanese, Tsukiumi the water Sekirei and the last to join the harem this season speaks normally. She&#039;s a little arrogant, and demands that she should be afforded the position of &#039;first wife&#039; and so on, but other than being snotty, speaks like everyone else. In English, I kid you not, she says &#039;thee&#039; and &#039;thou&#039; and &#039;mayest&#039; and bullshit like that. She still keeps up the &#039;first/true wife&#039; thing, but while using pseudo Old English while she does it. IT. IS. INFURIATING. In the sub, she was a badass, beautiful, powerful, but slightly arrogant character. Worked very well. In the dub she&#039;s powerful, beautiful, and speaks like a complete moron. Doesn&#039;t work so well. Everyone else&#039;s voices were very well done, but I cannot complain enough about &#039;thee&#039; Tsukiumi. <br />
<br />
Of note, Kusano&#039;s voice was really great, Jamie Marchi who I always enjoy, does the voice of the Veiled Sekirei Uzume (friends with, but not associated with the MC). Another favorite Monica Rial does the mysterious Miya, and finally worth mentioning Brittney Karbowski does lightning twin Hikari as well. None of these fine actresses are overly apparent in their roles, so it&#039;s not sticking out like a sore thumb like the voices in some shows are. Overall the entire voice cast works well in the dub. I don&#039;t have enough experience to make the same statement about the subbed version, but they had all had a very distinct and fitting sound for their characters as well. Took me a few episodes to get used to the dub because I imagined the Japanese voices for the characters and some of the English ones were a BIT different! Great work all around though. <br />
<br />
The music is acceptable. The opening theme works, though it was nothing to get me excited over. However, the closing theme, them funky beats, I was all over that! I loved the ending theme just so much. It makes my &#039;play without watching&#039; list!<br />
<br />
Punches, kicks, destruction, background all sounded fine, but as I always say, kinda hard to mess those up. Even if you blow the punches and kicks and fight sounds, some idiot (I mean me) will think you&#039;re paying homage to old Bruce Lee/Hollywood martial arts exploitative films. So yeah, I liked what I heard. <br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
There are some good characters, really. We have a lot of boilerplate, predictable types, we have a handful that are nothing more than racks for the huge tits, but we do have some compelling ones. The MC and his burgeoning group of girls end up at a boarding house with a very beautiful hostess running it. She&#039;s all find until she says something authoritative and while she smiles, a picture of a super scary demon (tengu?) mask appears beside her and freaks everyone out. They all walk away talking about how scary she is when she&#039;s mad. Otherwise she&#039;s this pretty woman of the proper age to be the house mother. She has a secret however, as she&#039;s HIGHLY trained in martial arts and swordfighting, and no reason for why is ever given. Foreshadowing maybe? Hmm...<br />
<br />
The Veiled Sekirei is very interesting in that she doesn&#039;t live with her ashikabi, and that her ashikabi is not the gender one would expect. This places great strain on her as she tries to live in the boarding house away from her beloved, and among other Sekirei who will eventually have to be her enemy (there can only be one winner of the Sekirei Plan (game)) She&#039;s also coerced into actions she doesn&#039;t want to do because of her situation. She&#039;s got one of the more interesting stories in the series, I wish we&#039;d see more of how her and her ashikabe came to be together. But what we do see is interesting and compelling.<br />
<br />
Turns out, the MC&#039;s little sister becomes an ashikabi herself, after a fateful encounter with a young man she saves from a bad situation. Sekirei are not limited to being female, as he&#039;s a young man Sekirei fleeing from those either destroying non-claimed Sekirei or trying to force them to become part of an ashikabe&#039;s harem against their will. She eventually kisses him and makes him her Sekirei, but there&#039;s a good bit of humor and fumbling before it happens. It&#039;s a bit endearing I thought. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned several characters in the story section, there are ones out there that each viewer will probably take a shine to, and some they will not care for, I don&#039;t think it advantageous to list every last one on the show, as this is a review, not a book. I think most viewers will find a girl (or guy) that they fancy and makes the viewing enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
Sekirei is not a bad show by any means, it&#039;s just a bit generic and formulaic in my opinion. I would not say it wasn&#039;t worth my time, and I don&#039;t look down on it. I know people assign their own value to scores, such as I&#039;ve heard people say 7 is the utter cutoff point, wont watch anything below it. But I go by the system provided by MAL, and it states that a 6 is rated &#039;fine&#039; and is better than average. Sekirei is better than average for sure. I found moments I laughed, I found moments I was tense about what was going to happen, and I found moments I cheered a little as things went well. I&#039;m not saying this is MUST SEE anime. But what I am saying is that if you like ecchi, harems, and fighting, then you&#039;ll probably really enjoy this. If you can tolerate or enjoy those same genres, but not love them, then you&#039;ll probably still get some positive mileage from this title. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: Miya the scary tengu mask showing landlady. She&#039;s so mysterious, but clearly connected to the whole situation. She&#039;s an utter badass, one I&#039;m not sure any of the Sekirei could truly beat in a free for all, and she&#039;s just so dang nice! I wanted to put Kusano here, because cute little girl for the win, but Miya is so much cooler, and can cut a bitch too. That trumps growing plants, sorry Kusano. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve got a moment, and need something to watch, I do recommend Sekirei. I just don&#039;t recommend if you&#039;re looking for something deep or meaningful. This is the action movie type of anime, lots of flash, a little substance, and then a lot more flash. Not a bad thing by any means, long as you know what you&#039;re getting into from the start. If I ever get superpowered alien chicks that devote themselves to me, I hope like hell I don&#039;t get the lightning charged twin sisters that constantly shock my ass like poor old Seo. Action-y thumbs up!

    Fact Number 1: This is for guys, and it&#039;s for guys who either love or don&#039;t mind ecchi.<br />
Fact Number 2: Sekirei&#039;s story is outlandish, absurd and just downright silly.<br />
Fact Number 3: Sekerei is a TON of fun to watch!<br />
<br />
I have to say, any anime that has me giggling for ten minutes at the end of the series gets a good score in my book. This anime is just rediculous by all counts, but as long as you don&#039;t take it seriously, every episode is so much fun and has tons of ecchi to boot. I can&#039;t WAIT for season 2!<br />
<br />
That&#039;s pretty much it. You can&#039;t
