    *Powerful opening episode plus a strong ending makes Ga-Rei Zero a definite must see for action fans.*<br />
<br />
“Will you kill someone you love because of love?”<br />
<br />
Those who have already seen Ga-Rei Zero (GRZ) are probably sick of reading the quote above, but it is nonetheless an effective quote to advertise for GRZ. I still remember what initially caught my interest in GRZ, it was the amazing trailer. Boy, how misleading it was … <br />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong, Ga-Rei Zero is quite fabulous indeed. The synopsis may sound generic, but the technique used to present the story that will eventually lead into Ga-Rei (manga) is what makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13517">
        this gem a success in this recessional era. The excitement level of GRZ can be described by a simple parabolic function (think of the letter “U”), though the initial point stands out a lot more than the ending. This is analogous to say you drop a ball from great height and watch it fall down and slowly climb back up. But no matter how hard it tries, in the end it cannot go back to the initial height.<br />
<br />
The plot of GRZ is extremely well thought out and well executed to say the least. Given the length of the series it is a very enthralling little show. Demon hunting may be the first thing come to mind after reading the simple summary of the anime. But what lies beneath that outer layer is the fragile little thing known as friendship and what happens to it when that treasure betrays oneself; that is the true moral of the story. Please keep in mind that GRZ is simply the prequel to the actual story in Ga-Rei (manga) thus you may find some unsatisfactory conclusion with regards to certain people or certain things.<br />
<br />
Giant CG rolling dinosaurs on fire seem unnecessary but they served their purpose. The way some of the dramatic scenes were animated could have used a little more work. For instance it is possible to create a more nauseating scene by using a more unique camera angle/position rather than attempting to semi censor the scene with dull lifeless angles. On a more positive note, the animation quality is pretty consistent throughout the series and the characters themselves look great, especially when compared to the drawings in the manga. The battle animations are perhaps the most notable positive feature to the show. Fluid dynamic animation plus smooth scene to scene transitions also helped make GRZ one of the better animated shows of the season. It is evident that a lot of effort has been put into the show by the animation crew, even the backgrounds in each scene is very detailed.<br />
<br />
As should be expected from an action oriented anime, the music is very outstanding. From the OP to battle BGM to ED, they all suit their theme well. The OP was nominated by fans as one of the top ten 2008 anime OP. Voicing-wise, Minori Chinhara was great playing as Kagura, and the unrecognizable voice change for the OP just makes it all the better. While there are not many superstar level seiyu (ie. award winners), it seems all characters received a suitable voice for themselves thus you will unlikely to have to clean your ears after watching each episode.<br />
<br />
Unlike most single season anime, GRZ is not one where you should marathon through in a day. It is as if Ei Aoki (director of GRZ) just had an uncontrollable diarrhea. He literally dumps all the nasty stuff at you right from the start. You are bound to be confused after the first two episodes. Take it easy, we have all been through that stage. It will be tempting to keep on watching, but take my advice if you want to retain some sanity; stop there and think about what happened so far as things will go downhill from here.<br />
<br />
If you don’t quite enjoy watching flying limbs or spurting blood, I suggest you stick to the TV release as they censored the “ugly” stuff in most cases. I also don’t recommend fans of Natsuki Kuga from Mai-HiME (or Natsuki Kruger in Mai Otome) to watch this as there is a certain someone here by the name of Natsuki Kasuga who also happens to be a motorbike chick with strong connection to dual wielding pistols. Though the difference here is how minor a role she plays and the cruel fate that awaits her.<br />
<br />
One thing that I didn’t enjoy about GRZ is the sudden appearance of cheesy RPG-like weapons after episode one. Bullet shooting suitcase? Metal drill knuckle? Outrageous combat wheelchair? None of that were in the trailer! And none of those were anywhere near as exciting as the hot motorbike or the dual pistols. Now that I think about it, I feel like I got trolled by the trailer. Anyway, aside from the opening episode I wouldn’t call GRZ particular “groundbreaking”, but it is unquestionably one of the best (if not THE best) action anime for the fall season of 2008.

    This review is technically spoiler free, but if the names, Yomi or Kagura, are unfamiliar to you, I would suggest watching the first two episodes before reading any of the reviews.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, when I first read the show&#039;s description (which purposely reads generic), I didn&#039;t think the show was going to be that good. So when I gave it a shot, the first episode certainly drew my attention, but I expected once the shocking cliffhangers wore off it&amp;rsquo;d be a pretty generic, demon-hunting, hero-coming-of-age shounen. <br />
<br />
Man, I was dead wrong. GRZ turned out to be biggest surprise of the fall season, and one of the best

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11070">
        damn shows I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, hands down.<br />
<br />
Story/Characters: GRZ has a simple story at its heart. The whole demon hunting setting is really just a conveniently action/guro-friendly wrapper for the real story: The making and the breakdown of a strong friendship. What makes the show so powerful is the great job the writers did in exploring and developing the relationship between Kagura and Yomi &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s when the show really starts to become something special. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the short 12 episode season doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow them to provide much background on the other characters and also leaves some loose plot ends hanging (which is probably to be expected, since it&amp;rsquo;s a prequel to the Ga-rei manga). <br />
<br />
But all that&amp;rsquo;s forgivable, because everything is really all just a foil to Kagura and Yomi in the end. The dynamic between the two drives the whole show. The comedy, the action, the drama and ultimately, the tragedy &amp;ndash; everything &amp;ndash; hinges on how much you come to like their characters and relationship.<br />
<br />
Art: The battle scenes were well-animated and ranged from stylistic to quick and brutal, which despite the fantastic setting, made the show feel more realistic. The character designs were streamlined and attractive, with particular attention paid to Kagura and Yomi&#039;s cuteness/hotness. The monster designs were pretty generic, but they make up for it by making the mythical creatures, Ranguren and Byakuei, look appropriately fierce and majestic.<br />
<br />
Sound: The producers of GRZ took some bold sound design chances - such as forgoing the OP/ED in the initial episode - that helped to amp up the show&#039;s atmosphere. The music also stood out throughout the series, especially during the battle scenes: ranging from a rock/techno mix during the exciting, stylistic battles, to the haunting and emotional, vocal-driven arrangement during the final battle. It always seemed to hit the right chord. Voice work was very good with  special kudos due to Kaoru Mizuhara (Misao in Lucky Star) and Minori Chihara (Yuki Nagato in TMoHS), as Yomi and Kagura, doing excellent jobs in roles that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected from them.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: If you&#039;re looking for a well-written, action-oriented show (admittedly, not for the squeamish) with really strong character development, I highly recommend GRZ.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this review was helpful to you. (Positive/negative) feedback is always appreciated. Thanks!

    Ga-Rei -Zero- is set as the prequel to Ga-Rei the manga. The manga, itself, is a supernatural action shounen so Ga-Rei -Zero- is set in the same way. While knowing the setting of the manga helps to understand the anime better, it is definitely not required to read the manga beforehand to enjoy Ga-Rei -Zero-. This viewer had never heard of Ga-Rei before the anime, yet was still able to enjoy the Ga-Rei -Zero-.<br />
<br />
For those not familiar with the Ga-Rei setting, it is essentially about an agency that hunts rogue spirits using exorcists. A Ga-Rei is a spirit beast that exorcists use in addition to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10777">
        other exotic weapons and traditional swords to fight supernatural enemies.<br />
<br />
Story: The storytelling for Ga-Rei was nothing short of amazing. The first two episodes occur chronologically towards the end of the series, but set up a conflict during which the rest of the series tries to explain how events lead up to such a conflict. This leaves the viewer constantly guessing throughout the series, giving enjoyment through suspense. At the same time, the viewer is greeted with several humorous scenes through the show that help lighten the mood and make you enjoy the characters.<br />
<br />
Art: The animation for Ga-Rei isn&#039;t extraordinary or anything. It gets the job done. The supernatural enemies look disgusting and allow you to develop a hatred for them. The characters are drawn in a way that you develop interest in them. The action looks fluid and is pleasing to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound: What really stood out to me in Ga-Rei was the sound. The background music really fit the mood well and after every episode, it left me questioning when the OST would come out. Furthermore, the Ga-Rei anime comes out with an amazing image and insert song CD, many of the songs which are used in fitting moments throughout Ga-Rei. Both the OP and ED fit the anime as well.<br />
<br />
Character: Ga-Rei really focuses on developing the two main characters, Kagura and Yomi. While I feel that the other characters weren&#039;t developed as much as I would have liked, the story is really focused on Kagura and Yomi and only their development is crucial to the story. The way Kagura and Yomi interact together and towards other characters seems appropriate for their age and their past experiences and because of their interaction with each other, they change and part of the story is watching their growth.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The combination of a great storyline as well as well-done action sequences put to an outstanding soundtrack makes this anime incredibly enjoyable for me. Once you start the anime, at least for the first couple of episodes, it&#039;s almost impossible to stop. The first few episodes demand the viewer to watch them one after another. Combined with the humorous yuri moments and other cute moments, Ga-Rei does its best to tell a story that can both standalone, but at the same time, persuade the viewer to continue the series into the manga.

    ~Note~<br />
- This will be my first anime review.<br />
- Might contain spoilers.<br />
<br />
Ga-Rei: Zero, is one of those anime that blew my expectations away; truly an anime I wished I discovered sooner. This anime is so underrated, I hope this review does some good. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you kill someone you love, because of love?&quot;<br />
<br />
That quote was what got me interested, and I watched to find the answer.<br />
<br />
-Story:  Basically two girls, Yomi and Kagura, that has experienced deaths of loved ones by demons. They both belong to families that are destined to be exorcists. They do their best to live up to their family names. One day they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review152205">
        met and began to live together as &quot;sisters&quot;. They then go and hunt and exorcise demons, which no ordinary human can see, under an agency that specializes in fighting demons. <br />
<br />
-Art:  I thought the animations were good for an anime that aired in 2008. Byakuei and Ranguren looked awesome. The fighting scenes are well executed. I also really enjoyed the final fight scene.  I have to say that the first episode&#039;s animation could of been more appealing.<br />
<br />
-Sound:  I don&#039;t pay attention to the sound effects as much, but I said they were good. I really liked the opening song, probably one of the few I don&#039;t skip. <br />
<br />
-Character: I say this is one of the good aspect of Ga-Rei: Zero. Within the flashbacks, you really get the chance to know more about Yomi and Kagura. You get to find out what their families expect from them, what they been through, and you get to see the change from when they first met to the last scene. Yomi and Kagura were well developed, but supporting characters were not as much. Maybe due to the fact that a bunch of characters got killed in one episode. There was also this white haired kid (forgot his name or wasn&#039;t even mentioned) which did some evil stuff and then disappeared 2-3 times.  Also got to mention Yomi is my favorite character!<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. Enjoyed the fight scenes, the sisters moments, and the family drama. This anime did its job of the demon-exorcist story, but also added overpowered &quot;spiritual beasts&quot; that wrecked stuff up, which was enjoyable.<br />
<br />
-Overall: This anime is a without a doubt, a must see anime. You will definitely enjoy this anime if you watch it with an open mind, and don&#039;t pay attention on the small things. This anime started from an anime that I missed out on to being one of my all time favorites.  What&#039;s even better is this is a prequel so it only contains a small amount of the whole story since it continues in the manga. So some things such as character development might be resolved there.

    After rewatching this series for the third time, I thought it was only fair to give Ga rei zero a proper review. Note that I’ll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. <br />
<br />
Ga rei zero was a pleasant surprise, defying my expectations of it based on its generic trailer and description. The first episode, in particular, was a “wtfwhathappenediwanttowatchmore!” attention grabber.<br />
<br />
One of the better shows that aired in fall of 2008, Ga rei zero tells a tale of two young girls, Kagura and Yomi, their lives as they grow older, and the resulting tragedy that ensues.<br />
<br />
Ga rei zero stands out for it’s well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26437">
        written plot, strong character development, and exorcism action. Ga rei zero can be depressing, somewhat disturbing, and very violent, yet overall has a very compelling story that keeps you going.<br />
<br />
Ga rei zero is the prequel to the manga Ga rei. It provides an extensive backstory between Isayama Yomi and Tsuchimiya Kagura, who appear in the manga Ga rei.  The true strength of this show is most definitely the story and characters.  This anime plays out as a epic human drama, exploring how family obligations, social norms, revenge, friendship, betrayal, love, hate, and intrigue all intertwine, with sometimes tragic results.<br />
<br />
What makes this story so powerful is how the writers deeply explore the heart warming (and heart wrenching) development of the relationship between Kagura and Yomi in painstaking detail; This fundamental relationship, and the conflicts that emerge from it, drives the entirety of the show. The story explores the making and breaking of a strong friendship, in this case the relationship between Yomi and Kagura. The sheer normalcy of the character’s personalities shines through, creating genuinely great characters. This makes it all the more heartwrenching when the relationships in this series slowly, yet surely, are torn asunder.<br />
<br />
Ga rei zero is a simple, yet powerfully human tale at heart.<br />
<br />
Ga rei zero proves  that it can define characters that go beyond simple good or evil. Instead, it shows us characters with multi-dimensional, complex characters, somewhat similar to how Miyazaki portrays his antagonists; as being a mix of both good and bad.<br />
<br />
As for art, Ga rei zero  has quite a bit of flashy fight scenes and battles; This series is almost certainly an action series in that regard. Ga rei zero is filled with battles between majestic mystical beasts, exceptional swordwielders, and … a fighter who uses a clothes iron as a weapon?<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, some of the weapons used in this show are the most unique weapons (such as a suitcase) I’ve ever seen. As dubious as some of these weapons are, the action sequences are solid. The quick, and brutal, action packed scenes will almost definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />
<br />
The music was somewhat generic, although quite fitting for the scenes in the anime. It always seems to hit the right sound when needed, contributing to the exciting, and sometimes haunting, scenes littered throughout the show. Soundtracks are always a crucial part of any anime, and I think it’s safe to say that the music definitely outdid itself in Ga rei zero.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8.5/10 (rounded up to a 9 on myanimelist)<br />
<br />
Ga rei zero is by no means a perfect show, but it delivers where it counts; a solid plot that is unusual enough to catch your attention, but not so complicated that you get confused or bored of the series. If you’re looking for an action oriented series with a powerful, well developed story with excellent character development, Ga Rei zero could potentially fit the bill.<br />
<br />
My expectations with this show went from little expectation, to curiosity, to awe as the plot culminated into a delightfully lovable, yet tragic story.<br />
<br />
And for those who do watch, I leave you a quote oft found in this series to think about:<br />
<br />
“Will you kill someone you love because of love?”<br />

    Most folk were hooked by Ga-Rei: Zero&#039;s extreme action first episode, I was bored.  Demon hunting, poorly done CG monster of the week, zombie like creatures, guro blood splatter and flying limbs, crazy fan-boy weapons, comedy. yuri girls in school uniforms, and run of the mill music.  Meh.  Seen it all a zillion times.  Watched a few eps, discovered nothing new and engaging and dropped it. <br />
<br />
Picked it up again in dub for something to have on in the background while I multi-tasked and was totally unimpressed until somewhere around episode 6 or 7.  THEN IT GOT GOOD.  Make

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45027">
        that Good with a capital G.  Character depth, relationships, motivations, it all worked and engaged me and ultimately surprised me with the ending . . . . which is actually the prequel for the manga and yet the anime manages to stand on its own merits.  Frankly, I found many of the supporting characters more interesting than the two lead girls but, given the fact that it was only a 12 ep series, there was no time to explore them further.  As usual, many of them ended up cannon fodder.  <br />
<br />
With the exception of the awkward CG monsters (they really put me off), the show has a very good look - nice character designs, and a color palate that hints at foreboding events yet to unfold.  <br />
<br />
I wish they had given me enough of the sophistication shown in the latter half of the show a little earlier on.  I would have enjoyed it in its entirety and not in fits and starts before I got to the tasty surprise inside.  For me, the first half was little better than average.  The last half an 8+.  I&#039;ll average it out as a 7 which really isn&#039;t a bad score.  7 = Good and ultimately GRZ was indeed good.

    First of all, I have not read the manga, but I am told that this is a prequel to it. Makes sense, since it is titled Ga-Rei &amp;quot;-Zero-.&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
Ga-Rei -Zero- is a series with many surprises. The first two episodes misled me into thinking that this was an action-packed anime with little drama or deep themes. But the entire series as a whole was deeply touching, focusing more on the friendship and love between two protagonists, Tsuchimiya Kagura and Isayama Yomi, as they go through thick and thin down a path that eventually splits into two.<br />
<br />
I was deeply impressed with the presentation of Ga-Rei -Zero-. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11830">
        first two episodes are almost unrelated to the entire story, but helps viewers to get a better understanding of the situation. Afterward, Ga-Rei -Zero- focuses on the central plot of the story with little to no episodic plots. There are some comedic parts to lighten the mood here and there.<br />
<br />
Characters were skillfully designed and came alive in Ga-Rei -Zero-. Through various interactions, each character, even minor ones, developed and changed throughout the story.<br />
<br />
The art and sound were good. Many of the fast-pace battle scenes were very smooth and exciting to watch as the characters and their surroundings changed constantly and smoothly. The many different background music fitted many scenes, whether they were comedic or serious.<br />
<br />
Overall, Ga-Rei -Zero- was very impressive, and I suggest those who enjoy well thought out anime should definitely watch it. However, it is a bit melancholic and serious, so for those who enjoy a lighthearted anime, look elsewhere.

    Wow, that was a special experience.  Let`s start by saying this is a GOOD show.  Surprising, even to myself after watching the beginning of Ga-Rei: Zero.  Why is that? Well never have i seen a show that was of to such a bad start.  The first episode is just horrible, it looks like a mediocre demon hunting show with absolutely no depth in it at all.  Watching the second episode won`t even change your mind about that...  But if you for some reason keep watching a true gem of a show starts to unfold.  What really ruined the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156773">
        first few episodes for me was the HORRIBLE CGI they used...my god, prepare for something amateurism like you hardly saw in your life...the person responsible for this should never get a job again in Anime.  Even the design of the monsters/demons is not something that will blow you away...  So yes, this show has a difficult start, BUT time for the good news, watching the entire series, i must say i enjoyed it a lot, This is actually a show with good action, some good emotion, nice characters and it just seems to get better episode after episode.  The story is indeed a demon hunting story, were we follow a team of exorcists.  The rest you will have to see for yourself, but it has some nice surprises waiting for you.  Don`t be put of by the beginning of this show, watch it, and know for a fact that patience will be rewarded.  Ga-Rei: Zero  was an awesome show to me : )

    Ga-Rei: Zero does shakespeare things.<br />
<br />
When shit finally starts to go down, oh boy does it ever. Gut wrenching, believable, instigated by an enemy that cannot be perceived and acting with that in mind completely outmatches our side. He&#039;s a huge threat and they don&#039;t even know - there is no big reveal, he just keeps winning to our horror and dismay. It was so well done. You don&#039;t want any of it to happen, but it happens and then some and all you can do is grimmace and say &quot;fuck.&quot; It&#039;s brutal, this is a brutal story - and the set up makes you care,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393655">
        because the people it happens to are likeable and handle the situation as reasonably as could be expected - admirably even - but it isn&#039;t enough. They miss by inches, by minutes, one wrong decision. It&#039;s fantastic and alarming.<br />
<br />
The feel and structure of this story far exceeds the norm in the genre IMHO. Execution in art/character design/voice acting (dub for me) keeps up with the quality writing well enough to earn a 10/10 from me which I wouldn&#039;t expect everyone to agree with. The &quot;edgy&quot; aspects of the artwork, the relatively dull fodder monsters and dated CGI (contrasted to the marvelous &quot;main monsters&quot; and animation), the weight and finality of events contrasted with the relative innocence of our Katana-wielding high school aged sisters, some &quot;filler&quot;-ish content that I enjoyed but might put others off... maybe the biggest one I can think of, the fact that Kagura&#039;s Dad seemed to have identified the main threat and then fails to share this information with catastrophic results despite his apparent 110% commitment to fulfilling his sacred duties... there are definitely points to debate here. In my mind this is all to be overlooked because what Ga-Rei does well, it does just that well.<br />
<br />
The first episode earns your respect on multiple levels and sets the highest of bars, except for a brief stretch of shit CGI - if you can appreciate nothing else about this series, it has the nutsack to clear that bar in the end. Rare enough.<br />
<br />
The artwork is really, really good. Though many of the &quot;spirit weapons&quot; are a joke, they don&#039;t make light of that beyond the introduction of the guy who crafts them as an eccentric nutcase.<br />
<br />
The relationship between Yomi and Kagura is possibly the sweetest thing you have seen violated and puked on since two girls one cup. At this point we&#039;ve seen it all, it&#039;s not easy to push past the built-up &quot;oh that&#039;s where they&#039;re going with this, SIMPSON&#039;S DID IT&quot; desensitization to bread and butter tropes - but this older title can still get through.<br />
<br />
My god, the themes - so if someone who is armed and dangerous takes everything from you and kills your father and tries to kill you and then begs for their life when you defeat them in mortal combat and you&#039;re underage and you run them through... are you a murderer? Do you see YOURSELF as a murderer? Another one - if your best friend and sister or betrothed is so unbelievably fucked after an accident you had nothing to do with she can&#039;t speak or move on her own but she can see, hear and communicate with morse code... should you be the one to take care of her? If you&#039;re also underage, should your guardians WANT you to? Does thier not wanting that make them immoral, does not wanting to do it make you immoral? Could you even handle the pressure or should you even be trusted to? Another one - is your Dad an asshole or a good Dad if he loves you but he knows you will have to bear an incredible burden one day and he basically decides the best way to get you prepared is to give you the cold shoulder, knowing it&#039;s going to work on you specifically. What should he do, increase the chance you will be unprepared but give you a happy childhood, or what he actually did. Another one - is it appropriate for a man to make an adopted child, competent though she may be, the head of an estate and leader of an organization when there is a seemingly equally competent choice within the family who was already in the line of succession, both from the perspective of potentially bringing out the daggers forcibly and also from the perspective of just being a risky fuckin&#039; bet.<br />
<br />
In the end... could you kill someone you love, because of love? Tsk. Ouch is all I have to say after watching this one get fleshed out... one hell of a start, one hell of a finish, one hell of a ride. Can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t heard more about this one before.<br />

    Ga-Rei Zero (directed by Ei Aoki of Kara no Kyoukai and Girls Bravo fame), is a prequel to Hajime Segawa&#039;s Ga-Rei, a manga in which two teenagers fight evil, may or may not fall in love, and mostly have a good time. Zero was obviously made to introduce more people to the series and get them to read the run-off-the-mill source material, but in the end, it entirely outclasses the manga itself.<br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts on the entire Ga-Rei franchise in a nutshell. Like most viewers, I had never heard of the series before this animated prequel aired, but I tried reading some manga chapters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10922">
        afterwards to be able to put it all into perspective. Ga-Rei Zero starts off with two oddball episodes, designed to get the viewer hooked by means of suspense and gore. Those two didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be the show&amp;rsquo;s strongest points however. In the end, it was the for anime unusually convincing drama which makes it jump from the crowd. But let&amp;rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves and start with&amp;hellip;<br />
<br />
The story (Please note the story only starts come episode 3)<br />
Zero takes place two years before the events of the manga. Here, Kagura Tsuchimiya is the heir to a powerful family of exorcists, who do battle with evil spirits and other such nasty supernatural things you don&amp;rsquo;t want to meet in a dark alley, or can&amp;rsquo;t because they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fit in said alley. Why do they do this? Because it&amp;rsquo;s their duty! Moving on, Kagura moves in with another family of exorcists because her own father doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to take care of his daughter and there she continues to grow as an exorcist (read: magical girl) with new-found sister Yomi by her side. But, evil has many forms! Dun-dun-duuun.<br />
<br />
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s thin, it&amp;rsquo;s standard, it&amp;rsquo;s not Jules Verne (in fact, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s more like Shakespeare). But what Ga-Rei Zero does well is taking a simple premise which doesn&amp;rsquo;t need explaining (because it&amp;rsquo;s featured in at least 80% of the stories in this little industry) and run from there by covering subjects which the show&amp;rsquo;s biggest inspiration, Sailor Moon, leaves untouched. Zero is, besides a coming-of-age story, really about the bond between two specific characters, placed in an all too familiar (anime-)situation. The twist this show offers includes a lot of doubt, self-resentment and crying. Think of it as Evangelion if you will, though that might be a bit too extreme of an example.<br />
<br />
The characters<br />
Main cast &amp;ndash; Kagura and Yomi, that&amp;rsquo;s what Ga-Rei Zero is about. I cannot stretch this enough. So, as one would expect, much time (of 12 episodes) is spent on the development of both main characters and it really, really pays off towards the end. Kagura fulfills the role of the empty shell (the Shinji) who has to deal with all sorts of stuff girls her age shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with, and though she finally makes some decisions near the end, she lets most of the show&amp;rsquo;s events wash over her completely. Which worked rather well, for me at least. One of the most vital aspects to Kagura&amp;rsquo;s personality is actually the extent to which she loves Yomi, and luckily, this is one of the things the creators got absolutely right. You will love Yomi, possibly more than Kagura herself. There&amp;rsquo;s just not a whole lot to hate about her; she&amp;rsquo;s a caring, endearing and beautiful older sister, who is strong in any conceivable way and will always think of her friends first without being a pushover. She&amp;rsquo;s the type of person the viewer can look up to, and that, again, is exactly how Kagura views her. As you can tell, it all comes together neatly. And because of that, it&amp;rsquo;s all the more painful when, well, certain things happen to our beloved duo near the end. Overall, character development on the two main characters is exceptionally well done and many key scenes are very well written. This is definitely the one part which carries the entire show.<br />
<br />
Supporting cast &amp;ndash;  Good thing the focus is on Yomi and Kagura throughout the series then, because the supporting cast is absolutely laughable. There&amp;rsquo;s a half-naked guy here, with a white afro on his head &amp;aacute;nd on his breast (think village elder from Hare + Guu) who speaks with an American accent and makes weapons out of teapots and refridgerators. There are twins here who both share the same name (Nabuu), have the vocabulary of a caveman, usually finish eachother&amp;rsquo;s sentences and present themselves in third person. It&amp;rsquo;s probably just me, but these are exactly the kind of characters I can&amp;rsquo;t stand, even if they&amp;rsquo;re voiced by Norio Wakamoto himself (the Nabuu brothers are, by the way). Other characters also seem to have been ripped entirely from a show with similar themes, Mai-HiME; a biker girl named Kasuga Natsuki and a certain mysterious, cynical, evil white-haired boy come to mind, but let&amp;rsquo;s not forget the magical girl squad team leader in a wheelchair and her female cohort either. It should be clear that this show doesn&amp;rsquo;t develop its minor characters, simply because it has only 12 episodes to fill. They&amp;rsquo;re a colourful bunch, I&amp;rsquo;ll give them that, but they&amp;rsquo;re absolutely not believable and I literally screamed in agony when the naked guy appeared in one of the most dramatic moments near the end.<br />
<br />
Animation and sound<br />
Animation &amp;ndash; Definitely above average. The overall style is a little dark, but so is the story, so no problem there. The scenery is average, some CG won&amp;rsquo;t blend with the surroundings completely and stillscreens are being used a lot near the end, but the animation is almost flawless and everything looks consistent. As for character designs there&amp;rsquo;s once again a huge gap between the main cast and supporting cast; Kagura and Yomi&amp;rsquo;s appearances fit their characters spot-on while some other characters could&amp;rsquo;ve looked a little less silly. Then again, because of that, this is definitely not the sort of show where you have trouble telling the characters apart. Monster designs are a little uninspired at times, but the show doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into great depth as to what drives these enemies and where they come from anyway; they&amp;rsquo;re exorcist fodder and their appearance tells us the same thing. Overall though, Ga-Rei Zero is certainly pleasing to the eye.<br />
<br />
Sound &amp;ndash; Not really omnipresent, but the show definitely contains some carefully constructed tunes to amplify the many moments of both action and drama. Especially in the first two episodes the creators had some fun playing with sound effects and so these are also well done. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen to the OP and ED songs on my iPod, but they&amp;rsquo;re definitely solid and go well with the show, not only because they&amp;rsquo;re sung by Kagura and Yomi&amp;rsquo;s voice actors. As mentioned before, Emperor Wakamoto is in this show and so I will have to give &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo; at least an 8, but the voice-acting overall is pretty solid. The only gripe I have with this aspect of the show may be Kagura&amp;rsquo;s voice, but then again there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of teenage girls in anime whose voice I do like. Yomi on the other hand is really well done and so is her boyfriend, Noriyuki.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Pure, old-fashioned enjoyment in this show comes from battle choreography. The fighting in Ga-Rei Zero looks absolutely spectacular; it&amp;rsquo;s fast, it&amp;rsquo;s clever, but also a little&amp;hellip; underdeveloped. Most action anime spend a lot of time talking about strategies, specific moves, they discuss their enemies&amp;rsquo; strengths and weaknesses, they get new moves, etcetera. Zero doesn&amp;rsquo;t have all that. Fights never take too long, either, as opposed to in many a shounen title (let me remind you again Zero only runs for 12 episodes). While some may be glad to hear this, it really has its downsides in that you never know what a character is thinking or trying to do. There are no rules. You just wait until one of two sides has been beaten to a bloody pulp, because before that, nothing is certain. If certain characters from this show would play Counter-Strike, they&amp;rsquo;d be kicked for hacking all the damn time.<br />
<br />
So to sum it all up<br />
Ga-Rei Zero suffers of two things. Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s made as an advertising prequel to a pretty underwhelming manga series. Why that is a problem will be made painfully obvious to the viewer in episode 12, but I can already you that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to get satisfactory closure, as the producers want you to read the manga sequel as well. Second, the show only has time to fully develop two characters, which it does a great job at, but there&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot more to the Ga-Rei universe than Zero has a chance of presenting to the viewer (I mentioned the 12 episode limit several times before). The creators shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had any problem filling up 26 episodes with Kagura and Yomi&amp;rsquo;s tale and in case they did, it probably would&amp;rsquo;ve have been one of my favourites of all time. <br />
<br />
But hey, tough luck. Even if its drawbacks scare you, Ga-Rei Zero is still one of the best anime all year (2008) and I think despite its heavy focus on human drama, there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to like here for viewers with varying tastes. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out if the show suits your tastes and that&amp;rsquo;s just watching it yourself. I hope this wall of text has informed you well, I&amp;rsquo;m giving Zero a rare 9 out of 10 because I&amp;rsquo;m sure these 12 episodes of animation will stay with me for far longer than most.<br />

    I dont usually write reviews for brand new shows, but this one blew my mind. though keep in mind that I have only seen the first episode. but as far as I could tell this is an action packed show that I had to force my self to blink because I didnt want to miss a second of the action.<br />
<br />
story- from the first episode, it follows a group of super natural hunters that go and stop the apparitions from reaking havoc on the town. like I said before this show is almost non stop action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br />
<br />
Art-

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8516">
        the art style was top notch, from the character designs to the backgrounds to the apparitions. the only thing that keeps it from being a ten is that the larger apparitions (B Class) didnt have the best cgi on them, they lacked a bit of detail. But that was mad up for in how cool they were.<br />
<br />
Sound- Though there wasnt much of an intro or ending theme to speak of in the first episode, the background music was phenominal and well placed. As well as all of the sound effects, every thing about the sound fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
Character- again this is the first episode so they couldnt get too much characterization done, but what they did to was very enjoyable. the main character Touru is torchered by &amp;quot;that man&amp;quot; and wants revenge for the death of his girlfriend. Ill stop there so I dont give away too much but as far as the first episode goes the characters are very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- this is a fantastically done show and look forward to the coming episodes, although there was a huge twist at the end that makes me wonder what will happen... so yeah stop reading this and go watch it!!

    One of the better animes I&#039;ve ever seen. Top notch stuff. Everything about this anime was just really well done. I loved the characters, (even if most of them were portrayed differently from the manga). There was action, there was comedy, and there was sorrow. Everything really was put together beautifully.<br />
<br />
Story- Very interesting story. I didn&#039;t read the manga so even when I started watching it, it wasn&#039;t outrageously hard to understand. I actually didn&#039;t know this was a prequel till later, so that&#039;s a good sign at how easy the story was to follow.What I have to say about it thought was about how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15500">
        misleading the first episode was. Not gonna spoil too much, but there&#039;s a hot chick on a motorcycle wearing a tight orange jump suit. Mmmmm sexy.<br />
<br />
Art- Art was A+ in my book. I&#039;ve never been big on the realistic look. I&#039;ve always enjoyed the slightly cartooney and colorful art style, and Ga-Rei -Zero- had that. The fight scenes were great. They were easy to follow, and featured some really bad ass moves. Definitely the type of shounen somebody might like if they enjoyed giant monsters fighting each other and ridiculous fight scenes pulled off by little girls. Gotta see it to believe it, but once again, A+ grade stuff.<br />
<br />
Sound- Sound was good. Loved the voice actors, they worked really well to pull off the characters emotions.  Sound track fitted the situations nicely and I liked it alot. I&#039;m never to picky with sound, but Ga-Rei -Zero- was good.<br />
<br />
Characters- Awesome character development. I really felt for them in their times of peril, anger, and joy. They each fitted into the story nicely, and all played their parts. They had some love going on in their (which I adored cause pairings are what make animes worth watching when people aren&#039;t hacking each others heads off), and some slight yuri if you could call it that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-  Enjoyed this to put it simply. It was fun to watch, I rarely got bored (it had it&#039;s slow moments) but they were able to pull through with some gut busting fights. Still nice for those who enjoy the mystery and suspension of wondering what&#039;s gonna happen next. It had it&#039;s drama, and all in all, it was a really well rounded anime that I think a lot of people could easily enjoy, even if they don&#039;t like the whole shounen idea.<br />
<br />
Overall- Definitely one of the best animes I&#039;ve ever seen, like I&#039;ve said before. It had everything I liked. A little love, drama, action, fanservice. It was awesome. I recommend it for anyone to watch.

    After I saw the overall score, and red some of the reviews at the end of the anime my soul was screamin &quot;and this is it?&quot;, no like seriously that was it? So to summarize story, Kagura (a girl who shouts only &quot;Yomi/demo/sonna&quot;) is a best friend and a sister wannabe off Yomi(a mediocre orphan written character) and because Yomi is in her teen age (probably that is the only thinkable reason) she will get brainwashed into thinking that it&#039;s NOT ok to feel hatred against someone who killed her father manipulated everybody to hate and abandon her by using a some stone which turn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193362">
        you into evil person, and because she is an exorcist she will kill her(which is ok, but nobody gets it), and so Yomi will feel abandoned because nobody but her close frends believes her and she will do exactly the same as the person she killed.... AND THATS IT, yes thats it, and not to mention that 70% of the story is a flashback so you know right at the start how the story will progress. So you are just waiting for something to hapen..but it wont. I feel really dissapointed. Not because the story was promising at the start, or because of unique storytelling or character design...oh hell no. I am dissapointed because my expectations were set much higher then usualy would be and that is because of ridiculously overrated score this anime has.<br />
<br />
Oh I am so angry, I wont even read my rewiew again for typos!<br />
Have a good night!!!

    Ga-Rei:Zero<br />
&quot;Will you kill someone you love, because of love?&quot; just seeing the tagline used in the anime, Ga-Rei definitely caught my attention, and it REALLY suit the anime. I was like WOW. Just from the tagline you can know what the main conflict will be. Despite that you will still feel eager to watch each episode.<br />
<br />
I gave this anime a 10 cause basically, I loved everything about it. From the pilot episode until the ending episode, I had my eyes glued on the screen, sitting at the edge of my chair, anxious about the what will happen in the next episode. I actually watched this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22299">
        in one sitting cause I can&#039;t wait as to what will happen next. I even finished watching it at like 2 in the morning even though I have class that day ^^<br />
<br />
From my perspective, Ga:Rei&#039;s plot is its strongest point. It is something you don&#039;t see too often. Amongst few animes I have watched, Ga:Rei does not have any similarities in comparison to their plot.<br />
<br />
I really liked how they developed the way the anime starts and end. The pilot episode is something that really caught my interest. For me, the pilot and ending episode are the most important factor of the anime. This is for the reason that the first and last episodes are the episodes that leaves impression to the viewers. And Ga:Rei did not fail in both. Ga:Rei started the episode introducing the main and major conflict in the story (which, did I mention, is REALLY interesting, and did not really introduce the main characters &#039;till midway) and then flashes back on how the conflict started. The ending episode covers some of the scenes of the pilot episode, and it was an epic ending (though bittersweet). Action scenes are quite good too. I especially liked the scenes where Nori and Yomi are all love-love and L.Q. ^^<br />
<br />
The characters are also great. I liked how the characters&#039; personality changed because something inevitable happened. Any way I like their personality. I can&#039;t really point out what I liked about them. I just do^^<br />
<br />
Story-10<br />
Art-10<br />
Sound-10<br />
Character-9<br />
Enjoyment-10<br />
Overall-10<br />
<br />
*I really recommend this anime. You won&#039;t regret watching it. At first you might be saying to yourself &quot;oh, another supernatural anime, etc&quot; it does not actually quiet focus on it but focuses more on the bonds the characters have to the people surrounding them. Really nice anime, I even bought a DVD after watching it for free at some anime site ^^

    What changes you? How does it change you? Who is the one to bring you to your breaking point? How attached can you be to make such a change necessary?<br />
<br />
SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE FIRST EPISODE<br />
<br />
Ga-Rei Zero is a story of change, bonds, corruption, and in the end, finding your place amongst class and expectations. It&#039;s not a perfect show, it&#039;s sometimes lacking in proper context, but it manages to work in such a way to keep me engaged to say &quot;yeah, I had a great time and felt immense satisfaction for something I wasn&#039;t the most hopeful for&quot;.<br />
<br />
Throughout my time watching anime, I&#039;ve begun to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247365">
        know certain series aren&#039;t neccessarily good or bad in just a straightforward sense of accomplishing its goals well or not. Sometimes shows can be good at everything it does, sometimes they can do perfectly well at everything and not feel unexceptional anywhere, and sometimes  they can do one thing really really well to the extent where its issues can feel more obsolete in comparison. Ga-Rei Zero falls into this category.<br />
<br />
In a future society where spirits can exist in the human world for the intended purpose of wiping them out, task forces are formed for the purpose of keeping the world safe from not only these spirits, but any humans allied with them for any reason, whether under control or by choice. We follow a particular task force unit in their job to keep the world safe, and then moves itself onto the story of how two sisters grew together, grew apart, found understanding and saw their passion until the end.<br />

Anyone who ever talks about this series will be quick to note the utter whiplash of the first episode, having the vibe of an action cop show, has with everything that follows it. However, it is my belief that the show&#039;s startling start not only gives a taste of what&#039;s the come following the end, in a similar vein to Berserk if it was properly followed up on in anime form, but it shows how even a team who seemed to have a strong bond with each other through thick and thin could be taken down with no remorse despite the killer never being wronged by them.<br />
<br />
The actual main plot shown through the promotional image, is the story of two girls named Yomi and Kagura, raised like sisters after the latter lost her mother, as they work for a spirit hunting agency their parents were a part of while also bonding and protecting each other in the process, even if it does to their detriment or to everyone else. In a way, it reminds me not just of Berserk but also Star Wars Episode III, something those who have seen both will be able to attest to.<br />
<br />
Most of the show focuses on Yomi and Kagura&#039;s relationship, and in my eyes, that aspect is the show&#039;s greatest strength. You see them originally as unfamiliar to each other, but they start to really appreciate each other&#039;s company through anything from sharing a house, to playing games with each other, to sharing pocky, to starting playful little strings of teasing, to wanting to push romantic relations for each other&#039;s sake, to helping to reassure each other despite how tough their job could be and what they might sacrifice, and finally what differences between them could tear them apart. Most of the scenes of them together are often pretty heartwarming, to make this sisterly relationship feel genuine, and the amount of time devoted to this aspect makes events that start to occur later seem a lot more personal than they might&#039;ve been otherwise. You grow to want these two to stay together through everything that happens to them, thinking about the future could be heartbreaking. Other elements about family, hierarchy, protection, trust and deceit slowly follow forward as different characters are faced with choices limited to their raw emotions. Without spoilers, the ending feels like the perfect way to finish off THIS particular story. There&#039;s more to do with the world at large, however the core tale, the one that makes up the main focus of this prequel, reaches a satisfying conclusion. The bonding element of the story, showing hearts torn and limits pushed, is really what made the show for me, even in spite of some issues that could otherwise hold it back. <br />
<br />
One particular issue is the ambiguity. Because this anime is a prequel to a pre-existing manga series, certain elements aren&#039;t very well explained. Most of it revolves around the spirit world. What are all of the varieties of monsters? Why do specific spirits show up at certain places? How do, basically the Head Crabs from Half-Life, make their way from place to place and why do they have more humanity than the other spirits? And most importantly, what is there to the main antagonist&#039;s plan/motivation and why he uses butterflies as assistance? The majority of these questions could be important, and it does feel a loss for this, however as far as the main story goes, they aren&#039;t entirely deal breakers. The main villain has a specific goal in the story however ambiguous, but the reaction from our heroines is what ends up being the most important. Second is the use of an early episode and a later episode. The latter episode has more context going into it and a handful of new scenes, but for the most part, the episode is basically shot for shot of the early episode. Not the worst thing in the world, but it can seem tiring to see the same episode twice on rewatch. Thirdly, the school setting. It&#039;s the type of thing that really feels like a crutch for writers when they don&#039;t have another idea to go further with their story. This works, once, at one point when Kagura experiences something, but otherwise isn&#039;t the most needed.<br />
<br />
Otherwise though, the story is handled pretty efficiently. There&#039;s thrills, bonding, action, shocking plot twists, and even a bit of mystery here or there. The plot prioritized its most important element, and in the long run, that was a benefit.<br />
<br />
Although the world of Ga-Rei Zero itself is not the most original, I do appreciate how well they mix the modern elements of detective agencies with the more traditional Japanese uniforms and outfits. We see elements such as the burden of carrying on tradition, how far your work can take you over the edge, and the difference between hierarchy and family, mixed with Men in Black style episodic missions to show off the form of work/how a rookie learns to accept their role on the job with all burdens associated even with what happens to their mentor. This dichotomy gives the show a good sense of identity, moreso than something like Blue Exorcist where there&#039;s just an ordinary school in a world populated with demons, or Mahouka where it has nothing more than a future city area the whole run. It does what it is necessary in Ga-Rei Zero to have something of an identity without being too ambitious in a 12 episode series.<br />
<br />
Similarly, if I could describe the animation in one word, it would be &quot;efficient&quot;. Although the production values are not the greatest, especially around the time when shows like Soul Eater and Code Geass R2 were airing, they get the job done wherever they need to.  Fight animation directed by Ei Aoki of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai fame is made out to feel kinetic without feeling overly flashy, and the lighting in certain scenes helps to set the tone, whether it be mysterious,heartwarming, melancholic, or action packed intensity. The amount of different weapons from Katanas to briefcase guns, as well as the variety of spirits definitely help the series, and even the one CGI spirit blends quite well, surprising for a studio that animated one of anime&#039;s most jarring CGI creatures in Deus Ex Machina from Mirai Nikki. The production values do everything they need to do in order to help the show&#039;s delivery and the tone of whatever scene its placed in, even if they aren&#039;t exceptional.<br />
<br />
The sound though, I feel does a great job consistently. The OP itself has a fairly good melody that helps to convey the action packed scenes, in addition to the parts where the show could be hopeful or melancholic, with some of its visual content being standard fair, but other parts feeling like more than that. That&#039;s Mother&#039;s Basement department. The ED similarly has an idea of melancholy to it despite the rocking start, but in addition, has a small detail at the end that changes after a little bit, to make something seem all the more tragic. The OST itself was low key for most of the show but well utilized in the battle scenes, especially the more personal ones near the end of the show, which were definitely elevated by their music choices.<br />
<br />
As far as characters in the series go, the main focus is on the two girls who treat themselves like sisters, Yomi and Kagura, and the trials and tribulations that their jobs and their outlooks put them through at the hands of the main villain. Others are there, but mainly serve as supplements for that particular purpose.<br />
<br />
Kagura, the show&#039;s main protagonist, is the type who goes from being curious to optimistic to nervous shattered to eventually achieving a result. This type of protagonist would be seen later with characters such as Madoka in Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Akane from Psycho Pass, but I feel Kagura&#039;s change of feelings seems more natural. We follow her very early on, in an unfamiliar environment with only her sister to guide her. That is her strongest bond, but she does not allow it to overwhelm her. That comes from the burden her new job as a spirit hunter contains, and her reaction to the job, and what came after felt exceptionally natural. She has a sense of potential that continues to grow, and by the end of the show, she comes out with more confidence for her future despite what she was driven to do. <br />
<br />
Yomi, who appears like an older sister to her, finds herself torn between her bond towards her sister, and her job as a spirit hunter to train her and represent the needs to her family. She&#039;s put in scenarios where she can have hopes, yet at the same time see the possibility of them crashing, driving her further and further over the edge to the point where her intense affection for Kagura becomes a weakness, one that sets her apart from everyone besides her, and one that in addition to the circumstances the villain&#039;s plan keeps putting on her, overwhelms her logic. There&#039;s a point where she&#039;s broken too far beyond repair and it was a cruel mix of satisfying and worrying. There was certainly some unneeded pushing into achieving her position she occupies at the start of the series, but not enough to completely undermine her fall. I felt for her more in 12 episodes than I did for Anakin Skywalker in three movies.<br />
<br />
The rest of the main cast are basically supplemental but passable. From the girl&#039;s fathers, to the head of the Environmental Area of the Spirit Agency, to the school friends, to Yomi&#039;s fiancé to even the main villain as an apparent afterthought, despite his manipulations at work to arrange the current plot events and nice design. As well, the character of Master Michael felt like a jarring tone shift entirely, and not in a fun way.<br />
<br />
The one possible exception is Mei Isayama, a character driven with similar ambitions to Yomi, but one who lacked the mental fortitude to continue along her goal beyond a simple use. She also has a role in helping Kagura advance on in Kagura&#039;s own development, but in a way that, unlike Yomi, doesn&#039;t let her hide her frustration, and be brought too easily at the ends of power. Her character&#039;s role does a nice job of assisting the story to its current stage, through influence on the relationship.<br />
<br />
Although most of the show&#039;s cast puts itself around Yomi and Kagura, they still do their jobs efficiently, and convey everything the show attempted to accomplish in its 12 episode run. In many ways, I can understand where there was a strong central focus. With only so little time, creating a sense of empathy for a large cast would be difficult, so the centralized approach works in the show&#039;s favor.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, Ga-Rei Zero, despite being too ambiguous for its own good, manages to pull through with a well told story of bonding, connections, revelations and heartbreak, some nice animation sequences, a well utilized soundtrack and a strong leading focus. I was surprised that I ended up liking the show this much despite its not great score and its status as a prequel material, but it was an interesting and heart rending ride despite that, one that proves that something doesn&#039;t have to be the best at everything in order to be a well done series.

    Action, romance, comedy, drama, supernatural - those would be the tags I&#039;d put this anime under. Ga Rei Zero exceeded my expectations, and I definitelyyy am going to be reading the manga for it too after watching this anime.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been awhile since I felt like I found an anime I enjoyed an anime this much. Ga Rei Zero&#039;s description here on Myanimelist is quite brief, and it really doesn&#039;t tell you very much about the show, so you have to watch it to really find out what it&#039;s about. And it&#039;s actually quite fitting for this particular anime, because this anime tells has such an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review184838">
        amazing storyline that you really have to give it a watch because simplifying this anime into a short summary would just make it sound much more bland than it really is. This anime is definitelyyyy worth giving it a shot. I was intrigued after episode 1, interested enough by episode 2 to want to continue to episode 3, and by episode 3 I was thoroughly captivated in Ga Rei Zero.<br />

    My first review so ... here it goes :<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The story of Ga-Rei -Zero- is focused around Tsuchimiya Kagura , Isayama Yomi and a little on the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where they work as exorcists who &amp;quot; exterminate those who spread the taint of death to the human world &amp;quot; . You get to see during this anime some interesting and good fights, a slice of Kagura and Yomi&amp;rsquo;s sisters-like life their having with a little touch of shoujo-ai here and there and the conflicts that lead to how the manga&amp;rsquo;s story started ( from what I heard since I have yet to read Ga-Rei

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10720">
        ) .<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
<br />
The animation is good in my opinion and it&amp;rsquo;s pleasant to watch. The fights are good and very interestingly animated with weapons you don&amp;rsquo;t usually get to see, but here are used as exorcist weapons. Everything looks well in place (even if sometimes the quality is not top notch) fit together to make a good show: characters, creatures, background &amp;hellip; everything. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
The sound &amp;hellip; to be honest I can&amp;rsquo;t really talk a lot here besides the OP that is totally awesome and the ED is good also, and besides this the sound is well fit together with the scenes so I don&amp;rsquo;t recall anything sounding annoying.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave the sound to a good after this being said.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
This is a good part of Ga-Rei &amp;ndash;Zero- . There are a lot of interesting supporting characters that fill your episodes with joy and excitement (especially in the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where most of them are from). The main characters are also interesting and develop well during this anime, you learn a lot about their past and you see them grow emotionally and in terms of fighting power also. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
In terms of enjoyment I can say that I really liked this anime &amp;hellip; interesting fights, weapons, creatures, characters and a catchy opening. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get bored during this anime at all and that&amp;rsquo;s good.<br />
<br />
Overall this is a good anime that packs some good action, enjoyable slice of life with a little touch of shoujo-ai and comedy &amp;hellip; and its good for a large variety of viewers and does not disappoint the audience after they finished it.<br />

    When I started watchin Ga-Rei Zero, I never thought I would enjoy it so much. If in the beggining of the first episode I was surprised to see how full of action it was, at the end of the same episode I was like &quot;what the hell.. everybody dies. anime ends. go home&quot;. (If you watched it you know what I&#039;m taking about). And then in the second episode other characters die so I was kind of confused and said to myself &quot;No, no. Something is wrong here&quot;. Well, the actual story starts with episode 3 so basically, the first 2 episodes have nothing to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review135639">
        do with the rest of the series. I know it is weird but in a good way.<br />
<br />
Starting with the storyline, I have to say it&#039;s pretty amazing. The two main characters, Yomi and Kagura, show us that the most important thing in the world is not family itself, but the persons who are not blood-related to you and still love you like they truly are. It&#039;s a sad story indeed, about friendship, family bonds, love and loyalty. Like many other animes, this one theaches us that with great power comes great sacrifice and unless you are emotionally strong you can&#039;t live the way Yomi and Kagura did.<br />
<br />
The music is awesome! Those sad and peaceful melodies which play in the background of the most heartbreaking scenes are completely wonderful. I haven&#039;t seen an anime with such an appropriate music since a while. Moreover, given the powerful beginning with countinuous action I would&#039;ve never thought the anime could be so sensitive.<br />
<br />
My favourite character was Yomi. Although she turned into a villain, she died as hero, as a good person who only wished to protect the ones she loved. Yomi was (in my opinion) the most complex character of the series. She loved Kagura like her little sister, she loved her adoptive father like her real one and nevertheless, she loved noriyuki so much that she couldn&#039;t kill him. In spite of the fact that she was such a hearty person, the rest of the family hated her for not being blood-related to them (which I find incredibly hard to live with). I don&#039;t blame her for wanting revenge or for holding hatred against May and her uncle (whom she killed) and I definately don&#039;t blame her for wanting power after she ended up crippled. You know that saying: &quot;You weren&#039;t born evil. Life made you this way&quot;. I think this pretty much sums up Yomi&#039;s life. Anyway, I was glad to see that in the end she let go of the hatred and realised there were still persons who cared about her. Too bad it was too late.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. It was full of unexpected but the fact that so many people had to die really saddened me. Their deaths were sooo sorrowful, they really got to my feels. What I liked most was how this uninterrupted action was combined in such a fine way with a remarkable life story and of course, unfulfilled love. There are 3 different things wrapped into a singel package. And this package is surprisingly good.

    I wasn&#039;t going to watch this, I can&#039;t remember why, but then one day I did...for some reason...and I&#039;m so glad I did! <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think there really is much story...I mean it&#039;s like a generic friend story and one friend goes to the dark side and then the light side has to bite the bullet and defeat the dark side and defeat their friend, ya know, Naruto like crap. Queue a shit load of build up trying to make the relationship between the two characters seem more believable and to try and make their final showdown more epic. Not that this series needs its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13471">
        fights to be anymore epic, though. <br />
<br />
The animation is incredible, it drops a little but never greatly or enough to ruin the show. And the art in the manga is VERY bad so it was nice to see how nice looking this was, with fluid fights (something else the manga lacked). Everything just looked plain awesome. Plus it was nice to see such random weapons, Irons and Suitcases for example (both of which were surprisingly badass).  Plus Yomi is just plain beautiful, I think I&#039;m in love.  <br />
<br />
I never really know what to say for sound, yeah the soundtracks great, yeah the voice work is great. Pretty much sums it up. <br />
<br />
The characters are quite bland, you have a pervert, a gay pervert, a coward, twins, sisters etc etc nothing really pushes the boundaries but all the characters are likeable or funny or hot or use a technique or weapon that makes them badass. You forget how bland they are when they&#039;re kicking ass and taking names.<br />
<br />
Somehow, someway I feel that 12 episodes was too many, the way they did the intro and outro had  way to much overlap (one episode was basically one of the episodes from the beginning with new bits pushed in the gaps), it could have been broken down into half the episodes, same with the flashback within the flashback that took up most of the series and moved way to slowly, I think their could have been other ways to build up the relationship between Kagura and Yomi and it be enjoyable for us at the same time. This could have easily been 3 - 4 episodes shorter in my book and it woulda made it more enjoyable, you got long, slow boring flashback episodes that didn&#039;t really seem to fight juxtaposed with incredible action sequences which did fit. I just wish they wouldn&#039;t keep taking their foot off the gas pedal. I feel almost that my time was wasted, there seems to be no plans for a sequel and instead of creating a sorta tied up prequel it was more like an intro into the manga, like a really long advert, I think they coulda done more with the episodes, had their own side story that started at episode one and ended at episode twelve.  <br />
<br />
Overall there needs to be more anime like this, the action was incredible, the story was nothing new but it was the Ga-Rei quirks which made it more than just a generic shounen. Sacred Beasts, Irons, Suitcases, twists and turns and characters that actually get their asses handed to them or died. Storywise it followed all the generic shounen patterns but it completely turned it on its head and it should be remembered for that. <br />
<br />
If Bleach was seinen it&#039;d be kinda like this...<br />
<br />
I have to make something clear for someone who didn&#039;t understand this review. What I liked about this series wasn&#039;t so much the content but what the series....stood for. <br />
<br />
It took a rather generic shounen story and turned it on it&#039;s head. It was dark and bloody and crazy and shounen is aimed for boys whose balls ain&#039;t dropped yet. So for that I take my hat off. Too many shounens limit themselves because of what they&#039;re but every now and then a series goes &quot;FUCK YOU JUMP!&quot; and does whatever the hell it wants. So yeah the inner flashback was pretty shit. But sometimes it&#039;s not just about the content.  <br />
<br />

    Spoilers Ahoy!<br />
<br />
Ga-rei&amp;hellip; where to begin&amp;hellip; Apparently this is based of a manga with the same (or similar title). I have to admit that I was fairly confused by the first episode, which almost never happens to me&amp;hellip; this might be because I never read the original source material. I think, for this one, I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the production value. Overall, the PV was amazing. The animation was fluid and precise, the artwork never suffered many flaws, and the few tiny flaws that it did suffer from are really of no concern. The characters have a decent range of emotional expression, which one really doesn&amp;rsquo;t see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8524">
        much these days. The music was good too. It had a bit of a Ghost in the Shell vibe to it, without Yoko Kanno&amp;rsquo;s musical genius. The show did have the tendency to rely on CG a bit heavily, but it was decent CG, and I think it made the Ghost in the Shell vibe even stronger (though production IG wasn&amp;rsquo;t even involved with this.) Ladies and gentlemen, activate the spoiler tags, because here comes the first episode. We learn that the show focuses around a combat squadron that fights against the supernatural. The strongest of these squads is Squad 4, who the story revolves around. We get introduced to the squad, including the bespectacled, fringed commander, his young squeaky girl assistant, Masaki (who I like because he is weird and has glasses, much like myself), this big guy with a scar who said a Buddhist prayer, a girl with a motorcycle that she can kill things with, and the male lead who&amp;rsquo;s name escapes me at the moment. The first scene is our male lead in front of a tombstone in a cemetery, and he has the first of many fucked-up flashbacks for the episode. From here on out, I&amp;rsquo;ll call them FUFB. He see&amp;rsquo;s this creepy kid with white hair, and he is standing over a body and surrounded in flames, then a gunshot is seen, and the male lead snaps back to reality. The motorcycle girl, Natsuki, picks up the male lead to bring him to the scene of a supernatural incident in progress. We first get to see a bunch of invisible zombie things, and they scare me a bit, called Category C, which I guess is low class. Then the main baddy for the show comes in. A Category B&amp;hellip; A ROLLING, FLAMING CG DINOSAUR THAT SHOOTS FLAMING INVISIBLE ZOMBIES! I shit you not, this actually happens. Well, cut a long story short, the incident is solved after some bad-assery in a water plant&amp;hellip; this is where stuff gets kind of fucked up. The lights flicker, and our friends from Squad 4 begin to die&amp;hellip; which kind of weirded me out. Why introduce a bunch of characters if they all die? Well, a girl with a sword kills Masaki, and the other squad four members, pretty violently. The male lead desperately calls base for assistance, and we see that Mami-chan, the assistant to the director, has killed him, and has a face-hugger brain-sucker alien thing on her head&amp;hellip; She speaks as two minds, and says &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll be going ahead&amp;rdquo; then shoots herself in the head&amp;hellip; this show seems fucked up, eh? Male lead has another FUFB and sees the white haired child and the body again. The male lead is screaming &amp;ldquo;Aoi&amp;rdquo; which I guess is her name, and the girl with the sword (the one killing everybody) tries to convince him that she is no longer Aoi. Aoi stands up and walks toward male lead. Male lead pleads, Aoi presses against his gun, and he fires. As Aoi falls, a swarm of crystalline blue butterflies (which will most likely be recurring in this show) fly away. We snap back to reality, where the sword girl says &amp;ldquo;I told you to give it up.&amp;rdquo; She then proceeds to slay the male lead. As the credits role, there is no ED, just the almost surprisingly haunting environment noise of falling water. Overall, the show is pretty good, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;ll know what&amp;rsquo;s going on until the next episode. I give this in total an 8/10. The beginning makes it seem like it might be generic, but it was fucked up and confusing enough to hook me in for the next episode.<br />
