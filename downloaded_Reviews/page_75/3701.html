    Cardfight Vanguard in many ways is similar to other TCG anime such as Yu-Gi-Oh! But also has it&#039;s many differences. The card game aside, the biggest difference would be that the plot doesn&#039;t revolve around some evil power trying to destroy the world, but I&#039;ll get to that later.<br />

This is probably what shocked me the most. I went in watching Vanguard with expectations that it would be bad and a downgraded version of Yu-Gi-Oh, but boy was I wrong. The story is about a kid who get&#039;s bullied in school, and someone has hope for him in the popular Card game at the time,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40611">
        Vanguard. He&#039;s then shown how to play and is somewhat good at it. Without spoilers, I can say that no one tries to fight evil off and they try to progress and get better; hone their skills etc. and that&#039;s what attracted me to the show.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I&#039;ve never been an art person, I mean, I watch One Piece. :P That aside, I&#039;m not the sort of person who judges something based on the art style, but this one was particularly good. You&#039;ve got the general anime style of the show with nothing major happening, and then you see those cards come to life, Wingal, Marron, Blaster Blade and it looks wonderful. Even the cards themselves look very appealing in the anime, but the general style let it down.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10<br />
Aichi Sendo is a boy in Middle School who was bullied and for that reason, he has a very timid personality. Kai is the jerk of the series, much similar to the likes of Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh, being a jerk and not caring about anything but winning. Kamui is high spirited and has hopes for everyone. He&#039;s probably the most loved person in the show in my eyes. Misaki is the shopkeeper who doesn&#039;t pay attention to much, but she ghet&#039;s better. There really isn&#039;t much character development yet apart from Misaki, so I can&#039;t rate this higher at the moment.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
As I&#039;ve said in the story section, what attracted me the most was the fact that they&#039;re not fighting for the likes of humanity, but to proceed in a tournament and get better at Vanguard. The card game itself is very well thought out and has it&#039;s complexity as well as being just a general fun game. It&#039;s fast-paced and works well. As for characters, I would&#039;ve liked to see Aichi a little more confident, but it&#039;s still enjoyable nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
The story works surprisingly, the art is well set up and pretty good, the sound is very well played, the Characters could be better, the enjoyment was great, and that&#039;s why this is a good overall score. It&#039;s a nice anime to try and get into, and you can even get into the card game while you&#039;re at it.

    Final turn!<br />
<br />
It becomes obvious pretty early on with Cardfight!! Vanguard that whoever said &quot;Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover&quot; was...clearly not talking about this show. Yes, Cardfight is a show you can and should judge by its cover, as that judgment will determine whether or not you should watch the show. But I&#039;ll get to that later. Let&#039;s run the bases:<br />
<br />
The story is basically thus: people play card games. Or rather, card game. Vanguard is the &quot;big thing&quot; in the world of Cardfight, as one might expect. For at least half the series, this basic idea is what the show runs on. It occasionally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57491">
        shows signs of wanting to do something more, but I have to be honest: most of it comes off as cheesy and laughable. But, well, that&#039;s only the first half of the series. Somewhere along the line, you start to be able to actually take the show seriously and like it. Its pacing seems slow at first (expected with 65 episodes of run time), but it&#039;s all the better to develop characters and situations with. In the end, Cardfight actually becomes a great story about learning who you are and understanding others through the lens of this card game. Power of Friendship is nothing new to anime, but it can still be done well, and Cardfight pulls it off.<br />
<br />
Obviously it&#039;s not without its perks. If you&#039;re not into the card game thing (which really shouldn&#039;t be the case if you even pick the show up, but still), you&#039;ll have a hard time getting into the meat of things. Then there&#039;s the deal with Psyqualia; although the last couple episodes make it obvious that more is coming, we don&#039;t learn much about this rare ability that is very important to the plot. We don&#039;t know where it comes from, how it chooses people, how it really works, how it may possibly be controlled, etc. All we know is that it has a tendency to bring out the worst in people.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the perks tend to be minor and shouldn&#039;t bother you too much if you go into the show knowing what to expect: lots of card games. And lots of card games you will get.<br />
<br />
Art and animation is reasonable for what seems to be an average-budget kid&#039;s show. Many settings and details are rather plain, but the card fights are all well-animated and the monsters all look pretty cool and distinguishable. It&#039;s obvious where they put the effort, and really: what else would you expect?<br />
<br />
Now, I could have sworn when I first heard him that the main character in this was voiced by a woman, but I was wrong. Seriously, for a long time Aichi sounds very girly and wimpy. It&#039;s odd at first, but you get used to it, and when Stuff Starts Happening, it gets better.Voice work is, again, of fairly standard quality; it&#039;s good, usually well done, and generally not poor. There is, at least, nothing for me to complain about. Music is quite well done. The second opening in particular is a great way to get hyped, especially in the final 15 or so episodes when things really start to get heated. In-series music stays suitably light-hearted. It is, essentially, &quot;game music.&quot; It never takes itself too seriously (well, until the last episode), and this turns out to be for the better.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, Aichi sounds very wimpy and girly for a long time. This is because he is. As an example, when asked what he would do in a dangerous situation, his response is to &quot;always be sure I have a path of retreat behind me.&quot; I know what you&#039;re thinking: &quot;Not another wimpy male lead! I&#039;ll pass!&quot; And no, it&#039;s not the most pleasant thing to behold. But in a way, I was able to accept it. I remembered that this show is aimed more at kids than someone my own age, and since I knew it would go on for a while, I was able to bear it even though I didn&#039;t like it (just the character, not the show). I was rewarded in the end. Aichi gradually grows into a mature character with a backbone that I was proud to see through. As his ability in Vanguard grows, so does he. He learns to fight his fights, help others, and make a name for himself.<br />
<br />
65 episodes leaves room for a lot of characters, but I don&#039;t want to go into full detail on all of them or I&#039;ll be here all night. Basically: the important characters all get their time, and the side characters get a reasonable amount, good and bad. Kai just seems like you&#039;re typical, stone cold, bad friend for a long time, and though he really only turns into a jerk with a heart of gold, seeing what he went through really makes you understand and relate to him as a character, and this also leads into the development for the series&#039; main villain, Ren, who is a huge, overconfident (well, he largely does have the ability to back it up) asshole that you just can&#039;t wait to see defeated (note: that isn&#039;t a bad thing).<br />
<br />
Skipping over a few characters to the negative side: Katsumi, an eventual friend of Aichi, is the comic relief who is...just not funny. He&#039;s a loser who thinks he&#039;s awesome, and the gimmick gets really old really fast and just never dies. That&#039;s the worst of it, but Doctor O, the guest commentator for tournament Cardfights, I think was also supposed to be humorous, and again, isn&#039;t. He&#039;s just kind of strange. But luckily, he isn&#039;t overdone.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s the important part of the review, as I hinted at in the first paragraph: if you read all that and thought, &quot;Doesn&#039;t sound like a show I&#039;d ever want to watch,&quot; trust yourself; don&#039;t watch it. You&#039;re probably not going to like it. I went into this wanting a show about card games just for a fun twenty minutes every week and got exactly what I wanted. If that&#039;s what you want, go for it; you won&#039;t be let down. But it has to be stressed: you really must know you want this if you&#039;re going to enjoy it. It&#039;s not going to surprise you and turn into something epic if you&#039;re not prepared to watch a lot of card games (65 episodes, remember?). You&#039;ll probably just drop it before you hit the ten episode mark.<br />
<br />
Think about what you want. If you&#039;re ever thinking, &quot;Yeah, I could use a fun show about a card game to kill some time,&quot; that is when you should watch this. It is very much a kid&#039;s show (read: not average MAL age), so you need to be either young enough or old enough to really enjoy and respect it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I went into it thinking it would be as I just described: a time-killer every week. Watch some card games for fun. It was never high on my priority list, but I always looked out for it. But then somewhere along the line it turned into something more. It became highly anticipated, and eventually it was the show I looked forward to the most every week (and by Winter 2012 I was keeping up with 20+ shows). If you ARE willing to watch and have fun with the show&#039;s first half, you&#039;ll be more than excited to continue as you get further on in the series.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t consider myself the greatest of reviewers, but I wanted to do this show some justice and provide both sides of the spectrum: the kind of person who will like it and the kind of person who won&#039;t. Otherwise I feel most people wouldn&#039;t ever give this show more than passing glance and just write it off as some twenty minute commercial for a children&#039;s trading card game. And it largely is just that, but it&#039;s also more than that. It&#039;s nothing amazing, and it never tries to be. And there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. It&#039;s still a good series.<br />
<br />

    After the 8th episode, I&#039;ve decided to completely drop this anime, reason, is that it simply follows the card battles done in the original &#039;Yu Gi Oh&quot; franchise, the differences were too minimal and already things are just too predictable, in fact, every episode seems to have similarities of any  &quot;Yu Gi Oh&quot; franchise. So why all the 5&#039;s, well, let&#039;s me discuss it:<br />
<br />
Story: mediocre number 5.<br />
<br />
Ok, so it&#039;s all about a muchacho who get&#039;s into a cardfight in order to prove something to himself. All too common to a protagonist in every &quot;Yu Gi Oh&quot; season.<br />
   <br />
Art: Mediocre number 5.<br />
<br />
not much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36269">
        to discuss here.<br />
<br />
Sound: Mediocre number 5. <br />
<br />
Same here.<br />
<br />
Characters: Mediocre number 5.<br />
<br />
Well, in one way or the other, the characters seems to have some similarities with other &quot;Yu Gi Oh&quot; characters that we&#039;ve know. So, I need not elaborate.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Mediocre number 5.<br />
<br />
Actually, if one is to watch this anime, it kinda looks like that you&#039;re watching an alternative &quot;Yu Gi Oh&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: Mediocre number 5.<br />
<br />
I just got bored watching this.

    An interesting, but underrated anime show that deserves more recognition. The common misconception about anime card shows is that they are only for kids and they don&#039;t have good stories. I walked into this show initially because I watched Yugioh and I liked the character art, but the anime has gotten me hooked within the first few episodes.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
<br />
There are pros and cons to the story, but It generally remains in a positive light. It&#039;s a story about growth as both a person and a player. It is nice to see how Aichi starts off timid and grows stronger and braver as the series progress.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47345">
        Although it can be a bit slow paced at the start, it sets off a nice and lighthearted school life mood at the start of the series. The show gets especially interesting after the mid twenties as they go to nationals and meet some interesting individuals and rivals.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The character art for both characters and cards are appealing. The guys and girls generally look pretty nice, and no one has absurd multi colored hair. The monsters range from cute looking characters and knights to dragons and zombies.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I love the music themes, especially the second opening and both ending songs. The battle music is pretty intense and makes the matches more fun to watch.<br />
The first opening song is a bit weird, but you grow fond of it over time.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Characters personalities are hit and miss, some are cool, and some can be annoying. Aichi is the timid boy who becomes stronger over time, Kai has a cold personality, but actually cares about Aichi, Morikawa is the idiotic joke character who is bad at vanguard. However, the main characters all have back stories and through hardship, eventually grow and learn to love Vanguard, which is nice to see. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
A good show that has a nice lighthearted charm to it. The game is fun and intriguing, and the music make the battles more entertaining to watch. The art is nice and the story gets progressively interesting as you watch more episodes. It&#039;s far from being a masterpiece, but it is a show worth your time.<br />

    When I watched Cardfight Vanguard for the first time thanks to YouTube advertisements I absolutely loved it. I thought the story was great and well written, I adored the characters and I loved the soundtrack. Yeah, the production values were not that great but least it was tolerable. Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 is one of my favourite anime alongside with Code Geass, Clannad and Slayers. However, I was 14 years old when first watched Cardfight Vanguard and I was still developing my tastes. Fast forward 6 years later in the year 2018 where my tastes in anime had grown, I decided to re-watch Cardfight Vanguard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295725">
        just to see how it holds up as an anime without my late nostalgia for it. After re-watching 65 episodes of Cardfight Vanguard, I have to say this. Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 is a good anime, however, I don&#039;t think that the show is great as I use to as it has a lot of flaws that hurt the show quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The story follows a young timid boy named Aichi Sendou who is a had time socialising with his peers at school. The thing that kept him going in life was his rare card Blaster Blade which he received when he was a kid. It&#039;s an important rare card from &quot;Vanguard&quot;, a card game with the imaginary world of &quot;Planet Cray&quot; as its stage. From the day he reunited with the person who gave him that card &quot;Toshiki Kai&quot;, Aichi&#039;s everyday life began to change.<br />
<br />
The story of Cardfight Vanguard is pretty good but at the same time pretty flawed but for let&#039;s talk about the good starting with the first 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
This is easily the best first episode I have ever seen in a card game because not only does the show does a fantastic job at establishing the game itself as well it&#039;s characters, world-building and themes but it also a great job at drawing the audience in into the show. I loved how nicely paced where the first cardfight was as it nicely explained all the rules about the game itself making the viewer interested in buying the actual cards itself.<br />
<br />
The one thing that this show has over other card game anime is that the show is narratively grounded. Most of the dialogue, characters and even the cardfights were grounded where many scenes of the anime actually happen in real such as communication failure, misplaying, teammates looking out for each other when times at rough to even skill and luck that can put you into a winning side or a losing side.<br />
<br />
Out of all the card game anime that I have seen Cardfight Vanguard was the only card game anime that I was really infested in as most of the fights were won/loss by pure skill and luck rather than asspulling and Deus ex machina bullcrap that plagued Yugioh anime since 2000.<br />
<br />
Along with the shows, grounded feel comes in the show&#039;s world-building. I don&#039;t mean by city establishments but about the player diving into the hobby of card games where not the show a lot of realistic details such as having people open actual booster packs a tournament setting in a local shop where we spectators and players enjoying the game of Cardfight Vanguard as well a having an official national/regional tournaments that are professional in design and tone. This was easily the one thing that Cardfight Vanguard has over any other card game anime like Yugioh, Selector WIOXSS and Future Card Buddyfight and am glad the show put a lot of effort of making the life as a vanguard player feel very realistic and relatable.<br />
<br />
(Spoilers Ahead)<br />
<br />
Speaking of realistic Cardfight Vanguard least in season 1 by far the most realistic card game anime to ever exist as from start to finish the anime is very grounded in nature we see the highs and lows of set vanguard player, for example, Aichi, in the beginning, was a timid player who is not that good with game who often makes misplays just like a real new vanguard.<br />
<br />
However, the series progresses where after Aichi and the rest of Q4 lose they first nationals as well Kai giving him the motivation to get better Aichi starts to become a more confident fighter. However, due to Psyqualia Aichi starts to have a downward spiral where he almost completely himself as it starts being this cruel to not only his opponents where he completely slaughtered them in a Cardfight but his fellow teammates calling them weaklings.<br />
<br />
However, after Kai destroyed his Psyqualia winning spree Aichi starts to reflect off all the bad things he has done while he was consumed by Psyqualia and from there Aichi becomes a much better person where he doesn&#039;t rely on gifted power to win as being a loving caring person.<br />
<br />
(End Of Spoilers)<br />
<br />
Cardfight Vanguard biggest strength is how the show portrayed it&#039;s realistic portrayal it&#039;s themes that actually happen in real life. Themes of teamwork, commutation, redemption, regret, were beautifully explored in the anime as each of the 4 characters one of two of these them into they respective characters arcs that goes on in the story.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Cardfight Vanguard does have some flaws. The second half in pacing and at times quality times was inferior as the soon as Q4 loses the first national tournament the story starts to drag quite a bit where many of the episodes are just a repeat of the first half but with less charm put them for the most part. As much I love seeing Aichi using his Psyqualia to brutally destroy his opponents in cardfights I feel like the other content such as Team Q4 second journey of being the national champions to be pretty lacking until the final 5 of the series.<br />
<br />
Along with team Q4 second journey being less exciting compared to the first comes in the show predictably where almost every single cardfight in the second half seemed to have thick plot armour at various times competently ruins cardgames. I won&#039;t any of the cardfights as it will to big spoiler territory but all I say that I was a bit I was a bit upset when a more grounded card game anime such as this has deiced to take the predictable route that was for the most part not fun. This is stuff that I expect from Future Card Buddyfight and sure that show was a bit predictable but least that show was self-aware of itself plus team Balle du Soleil journey of winning the ABC and Gaen Cup were not a chore to watch compare to this.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that I had with Cardfight Vanguard season 1 is Ren as well the poorly executed Psyqualia elements. Ren himself was a decent villain at as he simply to gather many skilled cardfighters under his leadership in Team Asteroid, however, thanks to a terrible line that Ren said in one episode he quickly devolved into this generic power-hungry villain who simply wanted to take over the world using his Psyqualia. It was a shame because I kinda liked him as a character.<br />
<br />
As for the Psyqualia elements it was okay in the beginning but the further the show progresses the less sense it make thanks to show subpar build up of it as it just came out of nowhere especially in the last 3 episodes as the show tried to make  Psyqualia more epic than it actually is but failed due to shotty directing as the show barely truly shows the true existence of Psyqualia enough for the viewer to care.<br />
<br />
Overall despite the flaws that I mentioned, I thought the story of Cardfight Vanguard to above average. It may have a lot of good things but at the same time, it has quite a bit of mediocre things that at various points hurts the show.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters in Cardfight Vanguard I thought there were solid for the most part.<br />
<br />
First up we have Aichi  I&#039;m going, to be honest with you I really liked him a lot.<br />
<br />
Until Cardfight Vanguard all the card game protagonist he doesn&#039;t suffer from card game protagonist syndrome where they all overpowered and lucky throughout most of the game Aichi is a card game protagonist where he actually loses his matches quite a lot especially in the beginning as just a fairly vanguard player who has still had yet to truly come out from his shell. His character development and progression were very satisfying to watch as he is this weak kid who gets bullied and picks on for a living to this more confident person who is not improving his social skills but he also capable of fighting against the strongest players in the country. This is a card game anime done right as I getting tired of seeing theses overpowered card game protagonist simply winning by either getting too lucky or by a contrived Deus ex machina that the plot magically decided to pull out off its ass. Overall Aichi is a great character that I enjoyed from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Next, we have Kai and am going to be real honest I don&#039;t really care for him all the much especially in the beginning. He&#039;s not a bad character but the way he&#039;s portrayed in the plot was very cliche and boring. He&#039;s your typical overpowered character who lucksakes his way to victory where he hardly loses a cardfight. I may have a spot soft for overpowered characters in anime as along the set is self-aware of his overpowered as well be an interesting/ likeable character but Kai, for most of the shows run, is neither of these two things and as a result, Kai is a pretty weak character substance wise. However, I will give Kai this in the final 2 fifths of the show he becomes a much better character where more sympathetic as well having strong character development where he starts caring for his teammates. Despite that, he was a pretty decent character but at the same time, he could have been a lot better.<br />
<br />
Now we have my favourite character in the show Misaki. Out of all the characters in the show, she&#039;s the most developed of the bunch. She has a tragic backstory where she lost her parents in a car accident whereafter that car incident she became socially withdrawn to others especially to vanguard where it only brings out her worst memories that cause her physical pain. However, as the series progresses she starts to be more sociable where during the cardfight against a newcomer Emi aka Aichi&#039;s little sister she&#039;s stars to realise how fun vanguard really is as a game. I also feel like she was the most constantly relatable character in the show where her character flaws were better executed than Kai and Kamui as the show goes a great job at making us the viewer about all of her issues that she has to overcome. Her final fight in season 1 is the perfect example of this as she finally grows as a character who is not playing Vanguard. Awesome character well-done Busihiroad.<br />
<br />
Finally, we have Kamui and I have a love/hate relationship with this character. In the first half, he was stereotypical bro character who supports and cares for the protagonist well being. He was also pretty annoying as well he is the main cause of the bad comedy as well a contrived love junior love triangle that barely went anyway.<br />
<br />
While I didn&#039;t like him in the first half he due to his bratty Beauvoir the second half completely redeems him where not only he becomes a more mature kid but he a nicely told redemption character arc he completely redeem himself of all the actions that did in the first half such as arguing with Kai and leaving the team when the team needed him the most. This was one of the things I liked about this season. They took a character that would be in people character shitlist and did a 180 where he later transformed him a much likeable and relatable character who has character flaws. I really liked how the show closes his character arc where despite him losing the match against Tetsu in a final couple of episodes he proved that he has the right to play in a national level alongside with his teammates.<br />
<br />
The rest of the characters of Cardfight Vanguard were sadly pretty forgetful. Apart from Miwa, and at times Emi who were interesting and enjoyable, the side characters were not all that interesting as they feel like character stereotypes that we have seen before in card game animes in the past not to mention some of the side characters in the show were pretty annoying. Cough Nagisa and Katsumi.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters in Cardfight Vanguard were good but not great.<br />
 <br />
Now we get to the weakest part of Cardfight Vanguard the visuals. Am going to be dead honest with you guys the visuals in Cardfight Vanguard were pretty lacklustre. The character designs may look good and appealing but that&#039;s not my problem with Cardfight Vanguard visuals am talking about the animation. Now I understand that card game anime was meant to be low budget as they meant to advertise the cards but I feel Cardfight Vanguard abuses it&#039;s low budget to a point where many of the scenes of the show are still frames, recycled footage and stiff movement. The saddest part about is that this show came out in 2011.<br />
The soundtrack is awesome as most of the songs were very memorable and iconic.<br />
<br />
Some of my favourite tracks include Rens, power,Kai&#039;s Theme, Kamui&#039;s theme, Misaka;&#039;s Theme, Despair, Battle of Psyqualia and Kai determination. On top of having a memorable soundtrack, I really adored how the tracks were directed in the anime as gives many key scenes from the anime more impact making the key scenes more memorable. The soundtrack was so good I downloaded all the songs on my computer and I actually play some of the tracks when I am cardfighting with friends.<br />
 <br />
The first opening theme Vanguard&quot; by JAM Project (eps 1-33) is a pretty good song that fits the lighthearted strip tone of the first half.<br />
The second opening theme. Believe in my existence&quot; by JAM Project (eps 34-65) is in my top 30 favourite anime openings of all time.<br />
The ending themes, on the other hand, were not memorable minus ending 1 and 3.<br />
Now for sub vs dub. The sub from what I heard was pretty good but nothing too special. The dub is actually good. Yeah, it may start off cheesy where certain characters sounded a bit stiff but as the series progresses the characters improved to a point where gotten used to the roles. My favourite performance in the dub was Roger Rhodes as Ren, James Beach as Aichi and Carol Anne Day as Misaki. Unfortunately, thanks to Bushiroad awful business move the first season of Cardfight Vanguard has been blocked in countries such as USA/UK and some other places in the world however if want to watch it dubbed go to 9anime as it has the same dub that was released in 2012/2013.<br />
<br />
So after 6 years since my first watch of Cardfight Vanguard what do I think of it. Well, I think Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 has held up nicely over the years. It had some good intriguing theme exploration, the plot despite being predictable in the end was solid and the main characters were nicely developed. It, unfortunately, has some problems though. The comedy is unfunny,  the side characters apart from Miwa and at times Emi were pretty forgetful, the second half pacing wise was inferior to the first half and the production values were pretty lacklustre. Despite these flaws, I still find the first season of Cardfight Vanguard to be a pretty satisfying watch that I enjoyed.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a card game anime that is grounded and easy to watch then I recommend Cardfight Vanguard Season 1. It may not be perfect but it&#039;s a pretty solid show that you should check out.<br />

    Well...  Considering that the people responsible for this anime are the same people who made the original Yugioh anime, I would be hard-pressed not to hate it.  I saw and enjoyed the Americanized version of it...<br />
<br />
...until the show had gotten real silly with it&#039;s Americanization (&quot;Invisible Guns?&quot;) and magic powers.  If there was a time when people enjoyed playing card games (like people enjoyed playing cards), then I saddeningly missed it.<br />
<br />
And then there&#039;s Cardfight Vanguard; which basically kicks it back to old school.  No magical bullcrap, no world-conquering plots.  Just old-fashioned &quot;different characters go at each other with cards in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35386">
        a card game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I kicked Aichi straight into the &quot;pansy male lead&quot; category until he actually starts playing:  The Mouse Bares His Fangs And Actually Starts Doing Damage.<br />
<br />
Also, the story has this sorta &quot;slice-of-life&quot; angle that features characters being characters and not &quot;walking cliche&#039;s.&quot;  A good percentage of them either &quot;break the mold,&quot; &quot;break the ice,&quot; or both.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit.  I missed the boat on Yugioh...  But atleast I caught Cardguard.  And it feels like a better ride overall.

    I am really surprised that there aren&#039;t many viewers for this show on MAL.<br />
When compared to the shows of this type , it stands way out from the ones like YGO Gx and Zexal.<br />
<br />
Now on to the review.......<br />
<br />
Cardfight Vanguard is a card based anime , a genre which many might skip. Despite being a card based Anime it has very good story line and Good cast of Characters. A plot were main Character is very weak and timid to start with ans stays like that for most part of the show. On his way to become a better person and a better fighter he meets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160769">
        lots of new Characters which end up as his friends and rivals.<br />
<br />
The story is slow to start with but its okey as it gives time to its viewers to understand the basics of the show. Once the tournament starts the show picks up pace. The second half of the show makes up for the slow start by skiping most parts of fight of many low profile or unnecessary fights. <br />
<br />
ART<br />
Cardfight Vanguard has a very pleasing art. Its very colourful and way better than those from the YGO. From Character design to the background art one is sure to fell in love with the art.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
The best part about the show are its characters. Frankly speaking they are far better than most Anime that are aired theses days. All Characters are unique have their personality , reasoning and back story. Voice cast of the characters have done a great job in bringing out the full depth of the Characters...<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
If you are willing to give this show some time , then i am sure you are gonna experience a great joy watching this show...Its may lack in some aspects but it stays true to itself....<br />
<br />
In the end i would say.....this show deserves the love of the viewers  especially those who skip good shows like this because for its length or its genre.....

    To be honest, attempting to watch the series for a second time, I was not too optimistic. I had my first brush with the anime a few years ago, and it just didn&#039;t pull me in, and because of this, I had brushed it off as an anime I did not think I would enjoy. I have never been happier to be wrong. I can honestly say that this anime deserved a second chance, not only by me, but for any fan of TCGs.<br />
<br />
Being a long time fan and player of Yu-Gi-Oh!, the differences seemed almost too much. Game play seemed very simple and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338804">
        left the impression that the anime would be very boring as a result. This could not be further from the truth! Having followed Aichi Sendou from his humble beginnings; witnessing his growth, lack of confidence and eventual success has made the experience more enjoyable. The character who I connect with the most is Misaki.<br />
<br />
Misaki has an Eidetic Memory, meaning she has perfect recall from events that she has witnessed, including Vanguard Fights. Having great recall of memories and events myself, just like the character, I can come off as cold or aloof. Her story is truly transformative, allowing her to not only socially evolve and grow; her complex emotional struggles are laid bare before the viewer and other characters, giving rise to her reason for finally deciding to participate in Vanguard fights and tournaments.<br />
<br />
In true Otaku fashion, the show has inspired me to pick up the Cardfight!! Vanguard game in earnest. I spend the majority of my free time reading about the different clans, their role on the planet Cray and the focus of the different archetypes and subtypes in actual play. I have spent much more than I initially thought I would, procuring trial decks and singles, but that is part of the fun. When I compare it to the excitement it has awakened in me, these Cards, as well as the series, are true treasures. <br />
<br />
I will be starting a Blog in the coming weeks, chronicling my journey with Vanguard. I hope it inspires others, along with this review, to give Vanguard a try. You will be pleasantly surprised where your imagination can take you. The visuals the anime gives you are just points of reference, and I encourage you to allow yourself to fully visualize the Planet Cray yourself. This anime is a gift to anyone who needs their imaginative side reawakened. I hope it takes you all to new heights, especially during the bleak times we find ourselves in. May it give you hope for a better tomorrow.

    Vanguard is currently a very popular card game and I can even argue that it can surpass its predecessors and the game has no one to thank but this show for introducing it to the world.<br />
<br />
The story is nothing great but instead to me it is the characters who really make this show great.Not only are they relatable but they each have their own stories and goals.<br />
<br />
Lets start off with the main character Aichi Sendou.As he is the main protagonist of the show he carries alot of responsibilities and I am happy to say that he does it well as he is very relatable and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265037">
        also in ways represent us in the world of Vanguard.He starts off as a nobody with no knowledge of the game and immediately we can relate as we are also most likely new to the game.So as the story goes on we are learning about the game with Aichi and unlike other card game shows who the main protagonist is most likely already very good at the game or has experience playing.Aichi is a beginner just like us so we can see ourself&#039;s in him.<br />
<br />
Just to add on we can talk about another character in this show.Toshiki Kai who is considered to be the main rival and goal to our main protagonist.Have you ever had a senior who introduced you to try something and end up loving it and start to work very hard to try to become better or even surpass him.Well that is what Kai is to Aichi a goal to become someone stronger.Just this makes the show interesting as we watch a beginner strive hard to surpass his an experienced player and impress him which is most likely what we would want if we were introduced to something and want to get better.<br />
<br />
Just these 2 characters should be more than enough for me to convince you to try and watch this series and hopefully even play the game and grow this community to greater heights.

    Story<br />
At first I enjoyed how laid back the show was. It was the first marketing vehicle anime I&#039;d watched where card games didn&#039;t decide the fate of the world. Then that changed when the series antagonist shows up. The show doesn&#039;t suffer tremendously, even weaving in a &quot;believe in your own power&quot; theme, but I still want a slice of life card game anime one day.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Considering how recent this show is, the art quality rather lacking. The character designs are interesting, but the animation seems rather low budget. But since the show&#039;s still airing, I suppose they had to cut corners somewhere.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music really did

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125217">
        its job in setting the mood. The orchestral music made the towering dragons and knights seem like legendary titans. There was also some awesome guitar music when things got exciting.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
This show has a wide variety of character types, from the blundering Morikawa and hot blooded Kamui, to Kai and Ren who feel like they&#039;re from Final Fantasy. With such a diverse cast, you should easily be able to find a favorite. Something to be noted, however, is the abundance of Yaoi fodder between two of the main characters. Not that this is a problem, but if you thought yugioh was homoerotic, this show&#039;s ten times more.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall<br />
I found Cardfight Vanguard to be quite entertaining. It brought back fond memories of my days as a yugioh player. If you also want a rush of childhood nostalgia, or are just looking for a new TCG to play, then this is the anime for you.

    Okay.. The reviews I&#039;ve read so far are ALL hating this because of the similarities between yugioh (and other TCG anime)<br />
<br />
And by reading the other reviews you can make your own assumption on the anime<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to review the TCG more than the anime.<br />
<br />
The anime isn&#039;t groundbreaking.. Again, it&#039;s like any other TCG anime.. But the TCG itself Is really interesting. I read somewhere that the anime is only a promotional tool for the card game and it maybe But It&#039;s a unique game but at the same time feels similar to other great games. Which makes it easier to get into.<br />
<br />
It has a unique

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36331">
        monsters only type&#039;ve gameplay, (so no spells or traps or anything) but monsters have certain abilities and things called Drive Trigger (kind&#039;ve like the Shield Triggers in Duel Masters) to influence the match in various ways. <br />
<br />
The ratings I have given are based on the anime and NOT the TCG itself. If I had to give a rating for the TCG i would&#039;ve given it a higher rating! But that isn&#039;t the case!<br />
<br />
If you want to watch a new TCG based anime to get into something new, then i suggest you watch. But if you want to watch it for entertainment reasons, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.

    It&#039;s like Yu-Gi-Oh, except the card game is unnecessarily confusing and you can actually like the female characters.<br />
<br />
I love it, I love all the characters (except Morikawa and Kamui, but they become bearable and actually decent like 20 episodes in). The rivalry between Kai and Aichi is actually unique compared to other anime with similar aspects and genre. They don&#039;t hate each other and Aichi aspires to be like Kai, so much that he falls down the wrong path before Kai sets him right. The plot itself is actually pretty unique and it&#039;s not based solely on tournaments or character development, there&#039;s a really nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286314">
        balance.<br />
<br />
The main character isn&#039;t &#039;OP&#039; or the &#039;best at the game&#039;, he actually grows and learns the game and develops through his experiences throughout the anime. There isn&#039;t actually a cliché fight so far and despite it just being about a card game, it can really put you on the edge of your seat. Things aren&#039;t dragged out and a cardfight doesn&#039;t last several episodes, so you don&#039;t get bored and feel like skipping episodes until you find out the winner.<br />
<br />
Overall, for the story I give it a 10. All of the characters go through some sort of development process, none of them really have clichéd backstories that you can guess just by looking at the characters. The creators did really well to create a perfect balance with the characters&#039; development and plot, as I mentioned previously. Arcs aren&#039;t so boringly long and it&#039;s not repetitive, you can&#039;t really guess what happens next. &#039;Vanguard&#039; - the card game - is complex. I think they kinda overdid it with the rules and the riding/superior riding + triggers. Everything happens all at once and it&#039;s heavily RNG-based, unless of course you have the psyqualia. But that makes it even more interesting. If you&#039;re watching it to learn the game, you will have to look up the rules and do research online, either that or I&#039;m just dense. Either way, I like it. It&#039;s unique, despite it&#039;s genre.<br />
<br />
For art, it&#039;s actually pretty good, a solid 9 from me. They have the typical crazy, gravity defying hair, but the animation style is something you can&#039;t get bored of or hurts your eyes. I really love the details they&#039;ve done for the eyes, especially for psyqualia and just how they draw your attention and allow you to interpret character&#039;s emotions. It really adds to their personalities.<br />
<br />
Sound, there&#039;s not much to say. I love the opening/endingss, but I don&#039;t pay much attention to the OSTs playing in the back. Sometimes it can be repetitive with the sound, but tbh, that&#039;s normal. It gets an 8 from me, because I love the opening.<br />
<br />
The characters deserve an 8.5. So I&#039;ll round it up to 9. I&#039;ll say it now, Kai and Aichi are great. They&#039;re like rivals and best friends, and this only gets stronger throughout with each fight. Their friendship gets tested several times throughout which makes them stronger and play better. Team Q4 are great, including the &#039;manager&#039;. The only issue with the characters are that Komui and Morikawa are obnoxious for the first 20 episodes and Misaki, one of the best and well developed characters IMO, is introduced later on and isn&#039;t given a purpose until like 30 episodes in. She&#039;s such a good character, yet she just isn&#039;t memorable. It kinda wasted great opportunities. Aichi isn&#039;t OP from the start. He doesn&#039;t actually know what he&#039;s doing. He learns the game and doesn&#039;t suddenly get good at the game, which is nice, it has great pacing and isn&#039;t boring because he&#039;s already the best. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment and overall, I give this a 9. The thing that lets it down the most is just that the sound isn&#039;t something that resonates and isn&#039;t memorable other than the opening and the issues with the characters which I mentioned.<br />
<br />
I love this show and even though I&#039;m not yet finished with it, I know that I will love it til the very end.

    After years of constant bullying main hero whatshisface decides he is done with the &quot;bullshit&quot; of his life and decides to kill himself after school. on his way he is stopped by a man named Kobra Kai, kevin sees whatshisface distress and decides to help him, he does this by becoming his gay lover.<br />
  The story is very true to life and i can very easily relate to whatshisface&#039;s problem, kevin is very likable, and the drug store clerk (not mentioned in the synopsis) has a believable character arc. The problems with the characters is the the two main characters are gay. The bible

          <span style="display: none;" id="review127111">
        states the a man that lays with another man is an abomination and thats what the two characters are, abominations.<br />
After only seeing 4 episodes of Soul Eater i can confidently say that goku WOULD beat up super man

    Cardfight vanguard is an anime who is based on the cardgame with the same name and the first anime which I watch and in my opinion is a really good cardgame anime but let&#039;s start the review spoiler free.Story: the plot of vanguard is simple and it&#039;s similar to the yugioh plot but does this mean that vanguard is a Yugioh rip off ? No personaly the only things I see these two anime have in common is that both focuss on a cardgame and have a shy protagonist who later starts to becomes confident aside of this two are different because while yugioh focuss

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343985">
        a lot to the supernatural vanguard starts to have a bit more slice of life style for the biggest part of it.The first half of the anime focuss on show you which are the rules of the game and it do this well it shows how to built a deck and it introduces you to the cardgame by showing you the rules the difference between decks and etc.That&#039;s really good because it shows that it&#039;s a ballanced anime which it shows you the game without becomes an advertisement with episodes something that not a lot cardgames anime sucseed also there are no fillers because even them introduces a new deck or a new strategy of an old clan even the second part which focuss more to supernatural it stillenjoyable. ART: The animation is just ok. SOUND: the music is ok voice actors are really good and I talk about the dub since I have seen only this version.CHARACTER: The characters are really good some of them are really intreasting like Ren or Misaki. ENJOYMENT: This which I will say now is something that is not influenced from the nostalgia .Personally I think that vanguard is a really good cardgame anime because not only it does a really good introduction to the game but also because is easy both to watch and learn how to play so if you haven&#039;t play a cardgame you want to see how someone who is playing cardgames vanguard is the best way to see this. Overall 7/10

    I looked at the other two reviews and it seems they judge it too harshly. Me? I&#039;ve watched 27 episodes of this anime and I love it a lot. Ahem.<br />
Allow me to review everything.<br />
<br />
Story (7)<br />
It&#039;s not super amazing and it doesn&#039;t really have a plot aside from the mystery of the power of the cards. I dunno it myself, but that really caught my interest. I love how the Vanguard game is played. The rules are interesting and I hope it gets brought out here to the USA so I can play it myself. Also, I like this anime a lot better than Yugioh. Yeah.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review40485">
        I went there. The score coulda been higher, but I don&#039;t like how Aichi continues looking for Kai and being sorta obsessed with him. However, I like how the series are progressing and hope to see if it gets better.<br />
<br />
Art (10)<br />
The art REALLY attracted me to this anime. I love the designs, especially the cards. There are a variety of appealing cards compared to YGO. The colors aren&#039;t dull and I love the animation. Need I say more?<br />
<br />
Sound (10)<br />
I love the OP and ED themes. They&#039;re on my iPod and they&#039;re addicting. I haven&#039;t heard a song I didn&#039;t like yet either. The music really matches the anime. I am pleased.<br />
<br />
Character (8)<br />
Gave them an 8 because of their designs and personalities. Coulda been a higher score, but Aichi is short like Yugi..Sorta like his personality as well.<br />
Kai = Kaiba? Um. Except he&#039;s more of a jerk. I know the YGO creator coulda been more creative. I love Misaki. She has a sad back story. I hope they get into more characters stories and focus on them instead of focusing mainly on card games. I was rather surprised they did that. I love the comical moments between certain characters. I won&#039;t go into detail though. ;D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10)<br />
Once I started, I couldn&#039;t stop. I had to keep watching, but urgh for it being an on-going anime so I gotta wait for more to come out. I really enjoyed this. It helped me learn the card gameplay more and hoping that this won&#039;t be a long, long anime because they&#039;ll kill it like YGO...<br />
Overall, it gets an 8.

    Story: 8/10<br />
For this anime the start was the worst for me to be honest, because after I watched 10 episodes the anime actually got dropped by me. <br />
However, I picked it up again just recently and actually after grinding through till the show gets rolling I started to enjoy the series.<br />
I personally really like it that this anime sticks strictly to playing the game and advancing in tournaments rather than saving the world or killing people in some gamble. The fact that the good guys can actually lose important games on this serie is really, really fascinating to my tastes.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
I cannot give a lot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118717">
        of in depths here as I can only judge based on my personal tastes: I find the character design ok and cards are interesting enough to watch them episode after another. Some higher level creatures could have something more exciting to them I think.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
There are a lot of stereotypics like Kai being your average &quot;I&#039;m better than you so shut up&quot; guy and Aichi being &quot;Sorry I&#039;m alive&quot;. I think the characters could be more interesting by quite a lot but there is nice diversity so it doesn&#039;t get too repititive.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
I really like the opening, ending wasn&#039;t too good.<br />
As for character voices they are way above average I think. Not a single voice is bothering me and there aint a single scream or shout that would make me want to close a browser like animes tend to have nowadays. <br />
The sound effects of Vanguard are pretty good and liven up the scenes.<br />
In short: I like it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Yeah, its enjoyable. It was really frustrating to try learn the game at first. Maybe because I am such a long term Yu-Gi-Oh player and its quite different, dunno, but after getting hang of the game you can actually start to anticipate what is going to happen next and that is something I look up to in card games: being strategically transparent yet surprising and constantly changing.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
Above average series after getting into it I think. There are a lot of different characters in terms of power and personality so it is easy to find &quot;your avatar&quot;; a character that you can think &quot;I would be like him/her if I played this&quot;.<br />
There are plot twists that are even daring to what they usually offer on this sort of anime and the constant development of characters in this anime continues to amaze me constantly.

    Although I really liked the show as a kid, I was still surprised with the new adaptation, even if I didn&#039;t like it as much, it had a lot of new stuff that made certain aspects WAY more entertaining while others are worse.<br />
<br />
For Example, the Story. I&#039;d give the Story a 6/10. There&#039;s very little nuance and everything is very laid out for you, as well as Aichi starting as basically a god of the game after only playing a few times was very immersion-breaking. In the original series, Aichi, for the first few games, is complete ass. And that is great, because it makes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312779">
        it feel much more real and grounded as opposed to this now where he&#039;s kind of just at the level of a worlds winner after MAYBE a week, whereas most real worlds winners have played for years. <br />
<br />
The art, is pretty good (8/10). There&#039;s nothing really wrong with the art and the character models do look really good. My only gripe would be that the backgrounds like PAINFULLY average, and they really contrast the characters in terms of quality. There are exceptions, like the river scene when Aichi is the big sad, god that river looks amazing, and most actual games look great, but outside of that the backgrounds really distract me from thinking it looks necessarily amazing.<br />
<br />
The sound is pretty mediocre. (5/10). The OP is great, the ED is alright, I guess? Most of the sound design is boring and uninspired, but there are a few nice tracks here and there. Not a COMPLETE drought but not an overall great soundtrack. <br />
<br />
The characters are.. alright (5/10). They&#039;re definitely not bad, and Kai&#039;s backstory adds a lot more to HIS character, but Aichi and Ren&#039;s character and duality were butchered in terms of quality. Psychi is underrepresented, Ren is more of a copypaste bad guy with not nearly enough time to develop and the story kind of just assumes you&#039;ve seen the original before they talko no jutsu him into being friends which feels extremely unnatural and a far cry from the original. <br />
<br />
I really did enjoy this series (8/10), as a fan of the Card Game, watching the characters play it and being able to follow and understand what they&#039;re doing makes it a lot of fun for me as an individual, not that it really affects it&#039;s overall quality.<br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;d give this show a 7/10. There&#039;s interesting ideas and the bombastic and over-the-top duels feel alive and like they&#039;re happening right in front of you but the show&#039;s story really drags down the ship.

    Blue haired feminine kid says: &quot;Ohmygawd! I&#039;m homosexual (not that there&#039;s anything wrong with it) and I love you for giving me a CARD KAIBA! I shall try to match up with you in our imaginary battles&quot;.<br />
<br />
[Story]<br />
<br />
A card game anime. When you think &quot;card anime&quot; you think YuGiOh, unless you&#039;re actually a fan of this show then you think &quot;vanguard!!&quot;.<br />
Alright so let&#039;s bring a board, a few cards, place the the cards while imagining that you&#039;re in the battle world and screaming/falling off your chair like some insane brainblast just happened. I saw this and thought of how that&#039;s possible. I couldn&#039;t understand what the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review57469">
        fuck was happening, though the whole card gameplay does seem a bit interesting.<br />
So in Vanguard the main rules are: you imagine that you&#039;re in a world fighting against your opponent with cards. If he attacks you, you act like you&#039;re in pain. This is just hilarious. Seriously, I was effing laughingmyassoff when they yell like that out of nowhere. Imagine JUST IMAGINE, people doing this in real life. Imagine hard enough, and you&#039;ll feel it.<br />
<br />
[Art]<br />
<br />
Of course, since this is just like advertising for the  board game, the art wouldn&#039;t be that good, and not that bad. Average.<br />
<br />
[Sound]<br />
<br />
The opening song was actually catchy. But Sendo, the main character&#039;s voice was Not Good At All. <br />
<br />
[Character]<br />
You&#039;ll see how many damn things this crappy show has related to the great YuGiOh.<br />
Sendo is a male who has the voice of a little girl. He act&#039;s like a girl. I actually thought it was a SHE for quite a while. He also like&#039;s this boy named Kai.<br />
Kai is cool, cold, heartless. LOL yes. Here we have Kaiba Jr. Obviously he&#039;s going to like Sendo a bit, act like he doesn&#039;t give a damn and cares about him soon (Probably doesn&#039;t know Sendo&#039;s gay).<br />
-Not important characters here- are the one&#039;s who act like Yugi&#039;s crew.<br />
Well, at least Sendo doesn&#039;t transform.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment]<br />
<br />
I thought this was a comedic show or parody from the first episode, it got boring from the 2nd, I watched the 3rd and dropped. It&#039;s retarded, just retarded. <br />
&quot;My Megaman card attacks your Pikachu card! GO CARDFIGHT!!!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;AARRRAGHGHGHG I&#039;M FALLING OFF MY CHAIR! THE PAIN IN MY IMAGINATION IS UNBEARABLE! WHY GOD WHY!&quot; -falls off chair-<br />
<br />
[Overall]<br />
<br />
If you like stories about card games, go for Yugioh if you haven&#039;t yet watched it. This show&#039;s just here for making people laugh. I didn&#039;t watch that much at all so I don&#039;t have much to say. All I know is that this show, is completely stupid. This anime is just Yugioh&#039;s poop. But it makes you wonder if that&#039;s actually fucking possible. I mean like, IMAGINING HARD ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FEEL PAIN? What about pleasure?<br />
HELL YEAH!

    this anime resembles yugioh and duel master but the game itself doesnt really have principle no traps no spells only luck.cards and knowledge<br />
<br />
the stroy itself is prety good-the road the walk through<br />
characters-i dislike the main character but the other one kai-kaiba is very likeable <br />
and some other not head charcaters are funny and intersting<br />
<br />
if you dont like the art from the 1st-5th episode i dont think this anime will be entertaining for you since 70%of the fun is watching the card fight and new cards being reviled

    Cardfight!! Vanguard (CFV) is an anime based on the eponymous trading card game and revolves around protagonist Aichi Sendou and his experiences with the game.<br />
<br />
There is not much to say about the content of the series except for &quot;card games&quot;. CFV presents to us a normal world where card games are all the rage, and are a large focus of people&#039;s lives. The events which occur in the series are repetitive, monotonous and predictable.<br />
<br />
There is a notable defying of certain devices which are commonly used in other anime series, especially ones based on card games. While CFV does not focus on deconstructing the card game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55213">
        genre, this makes the anime interesting to watch. The effects of chance, supernatural powers and character interactions are represented more realistically and are worth paying attention to when the focus diverts from the card game once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
The presentation of CFV is slightly above average. Fights between units in the card game are animated very nicely, but the music is nothing of note.<br />
<br />
Overall, Cardfight!! Vanguard is a somewhat thinly-veiled attempt at advertising a card game, but is still somewhat enjoyable due to good animation and subversions of devices often used in other animes.
