    Gleipnir is an over the top edgy mess of a show and if I had to give it any compliments it would be that the fight scenes are well choreographed and have smooth animation, but sadly that’s where my compliments end. This show is so aggressively gross that it makes it hard to enjoy any of the non-toxic parts of it, and when I say gross I don&#039;t mean like blood, gore, and cum type of gross I mean like reading a middle schooler’s hyper-specific fetish fanfiction type of gross. Any time the author tries to get me to sympathize with the relationship between the

        main character and the abusive yandere chick it just makes me feel like I&#039;m watching a gaslighting in slow motion. So in summary, Gleipnir is A show that had the potential to be a fun edgy mess but it just ends up feeling like it was written by a middle schooler with a very specific fetish.<br />

    Are you ready?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going inside. You&#039;re so sticky and wet. I&#039;m going all the way in. It&#039;s so warm and fits just nicely. Does it hurt? We&#039;re one now.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m just a mere being wandering on the hellhole that is earth and as such, I don&#039;t deserve anything worthy of praise. But when Gleipnir knocked out my doorstep I straight away knew that this was the present I&#039;ve always wanted. Yes, because Gleipnir is more than an anime - it&#039;s a new experience to be witnessed at least once in our dismal life. Something that would make our hearts go full uwu.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir isn&#039;t the usual story.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346138">
        It&#039;s far deeper than you may initially think. In fact, I&#039;d consider this on par with Monster. Just imagine Johan as Shuuichi and his sister, Anna as Clair. An indissoluble bond. In this case, however, they&#039;re not really brother and sister. Neither a couple nor friends. They&#039;re life--fighting for the freedom that some despicable beings have extracted from them. It&#039;s a harsh truth and yet, they don&#039;t surrender. They never will and with that only they&#039;ll make new friends. With that only, they&#039;ll have an adventure that&#039;s both fun and sad.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir was a pleasant surprise. Because I thought to see something where the protagonist just gets some powers and with that only he&#039;ll get out of anything fairly unharmed. While I admit there&#039;s a bit of friendship power in here I would be lying if I said that the whole thing is to build on that only. Shuuichi never wanted to be in such a situation, yet he&#039;s there fighting all kinds of monsters. Without Clair, he&#039;d be dead by now. She was an inspiration--no she was the will Shuuichi never had. Without her, he would have not done anything he has done. Isn&#039;t Clair great though? I&#039;d say that she was the highlight of the anime. Indeed she&#039;s the best character with also the saddest backstory in the whole anime. Not only that--she won&#039;t let anyone down. If she starts caring about someone/something you bet your ass that she won&#039;t surrender until it gets that shit done. Some may consider that selfish I&#039;d say it leads more to dedication. The dedication she has had is nothing short of a miracle.<br />
<br />
The other characters are significantly meaningful as well. Everyone in a pretty cool fashion do what they&#039;re told to do in the first place. Some are edgy and some are not. Some are cute and some are not. Some are strong and some are not. It&#039;s a near-perfect cast of characters that exist to give our favorite duo a run for their money, which is necessary for their growth in the repugnant world they live in.<br />
<br />
For you to understand Gleipnir you have to look beyond the obvious. Once you do that, you may come to appreciate its greatness.

    Gleipnir, what could we ever do in a world without you? A whole lot actually. For instance, I don’t have to suffer every week watching some kid in a creepy mascot animal outfit running around. Watching Gleinpir was not a pleasant experience and by unpleasant, I mean the type of unpleasant that makes you want to turn the television off.<br />
<br />
First of all, let’s ask ourselves, just what the hell is Gleipnir? It’s not a real word but a creation made by Sun Takeda. With that out of the way, you may probably want to take a closer glance at the synopsis because it’s full of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346146">
        bizarreness. Even our main protagonist Shuuichi Kaguya has a strange characteristic – the ability to transform into a monster. And after encountering a mysterious girl named Claire Aoki, his life gets even stranger. As with supernatural mystery stories, I tend to think Gleipnir as the type that tries to be as mysterious as possible. In this base form, we see our main characters trying to find answers but it’s obvious that something darker and sinister lurks behind the scenes. Does Gleipnir takes its opportunity to capitalize on its premise to make this into a pleasant experience? Hell no.<br />
<br />
There’s actually nothing wrong with a show being edgy or even use shock value to be appealing. The main problem lies on how Gleipnir executes its ideas. The mystery seems intriguing on paper until you see how thin the storytelling really is. From the first episodes, I got the impression of a ridiculous show without a clear target audience. Let’s face it, this isn’t an easy anime to recommend to anyone. At its core, we do have the relationship between Shuuichi and Claire, two characters that are practically polar opposite of each other. It doesn’t help that Shuuichi is a reserved individual with little social experience. Take away his ability of monster transformation and there’s literally nothing special about him. On the other hand, Claire is a clever girl who managed to blackmail Shuuichi and can be deceptively hard to read. Even though her goal is to find the truth about the monsters and her older sister, it seems no one can really understand her. Despite her age, she doesn’t seem to retain a moral sense for humanity. What I mean is that she actually kills others without hesitation and isn’t afraid to take daring risks. After gaining control of Shuuichi’s body, she literally becomes a killing machine although not mindlessly but with a purpose. Throughout the series, she shows no mercy towards her enemies and it’s shown to be taken lightly. Gleipnir seems to force body horror and fan service at numerous amounts, sometimes perhaps way too much for its own good. Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship is built on trust although with more episodes progresses, they seem to grow more intimate. Don’t expect true love blooming between the pair though. The author didn’t want to pull the trigger because this is obviously not some fairy tale romance.<br />
<br />
While Shuuichi and Claire has to carry this show on their backs, there are a few individuals worth mentioning. First, there’s Elena, Claire’s older sister who possesses a twisted obsession towards Shuuichi. Perhaps one of the most mentally unstable characters in the show, she represents the dark side of humanity and is willing to do anything to get what she wants. If you’re familiar with the term ‘yandere’, that’s basically what she is. Then, there’s the mysterious ‘Alien’, a character who is looking for other aliens on their planet. Truth to be told, he is a big question mark as no one knows exactly what he is. Taking the form of a young man, we do know that he will grant a wish to anyone who can help him achieve his own goal. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t devote enough time to explore his own story as we are constantly fed with Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship. Being a show about monsters, this came to me as no surprise although I do wish the show made more time on characterizing Alien. He seems to be much more than just a mystery. For what’s worth, most of the other characters this season are less appealing despite some having important roles. Kaito, Honoka, and Sayaka are a few examples as it’s hard to get invested into their characters. It seems the anime wants to evoke emotions for the viewers but with such limited storytelling, these characters aren’t worth to watch for. Even in the case of our main leads, they don’t strike to me as anything special. Shuuichi and Claire’s relationship is saturated by lazy writing that anyone could easily come up with. That’s also to say, the overall direction of the plot is mediocre at best and couldn’t be salvaged even if it’s twice episode count length. Thank goodness it isn’t.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope you don’t plan to watch Gleipnir with your family or kids around. This isn’t a show suited for the faint of heart. Gleipnir seems to be in love with itself, being that it loves fan service. It uses it in the form of nudity, body horror, and gruesome action scenes. It isn’t ashamed to pull the trigger with violence in ways with heads being tore off or body ligaments being blown to pieces. Claire is also a walking billboard of fan service as she’s half naked nearly half the show. And let’s not forget, she literally climbs into Shuuichi to control his body. That’s like some twisted form of metaphoric union. Of course, let’s not forget the appearances of the monsters themselves. I don’t know if it’s just me but somehow, Shuuichi’s monster form looks unintentionally comical. It looks like a creepy oversized toy that came to life. Here I am sitting wondering what made the author create a monster to look such way. Is how they see stuffed animals from nightmares?<br />
<br />
No, I can’t recommend Gleipnir to you and it’s more than just because it’s “edgy”. Even without the shockingly amount of grotesque elements stuffed into this show, it still remains mediocre by the contents of its plot and characters. It’s barely watchable at best and sometimes, I wish I didn’t jump into the manga either. Because for me, watching Gleipnir is kind of like eating junk food and you feel too guilty to know the mistake until it’s too damn late.

    --THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW--<br />
<br />
What if I told you an anime could be surprisingly well animated, have characters that get solid development, a fairly interesting story with plenty of mystery and action, a BANGER of a soundtrack, all of this combined...while still absolutely being edgy, ecchi trash? That is Gleipnir in a nutshell. It’s nothing amazing and there’s an argument for it just being a “surprisingly good ecchi show”, but I see it more as a genuinely good show with effort put in that just also has a ton of fanservice and innuendos. Having been caught up on the manga, without spoiling anything

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346152">
        I can certainly say the anime adaption adds some minor improvements to the story and characters, and overall does what an anime adaption should and enhances the source material. I will say right now if you’re not a fan of ecchi, you probably won’t enjoy this. I don’t like ecchi either but I was able to ignore it, and got a genuinely enjoyable and well made series out of it. There is A LOT of fanservice though, and straight up nudity in the manga so uh yeah be aware of that before starting the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
--Story--<br />
<br />
Want to see a half nude, hotblooded, not entirely sane girl kick butt in a discount FNAF suit? We got that. What about a weak-willed MC that develops a spine and tries to figure out his purpose in life? We got that. Maybe a gang of scumbags using the power of friendship? We got that. Want to see an incel get cucked by the MC, and cry about it? Oh yes, we got that.<br />
<br />
A basic synopsis of this story is just that Shuichi our male protag has the power to turn into a giant sports mascot costume for a reason he can’t remember why. He saves our main female protag Clair who was trying to kill herself, Clair figures out Shuichi’s secret and black mails him into helping her. Basically, her sister killed her parents and left her with a coin, these coins seem to be related to Shuichi’s power somehow, and she forces him to help her figure out the mystery of this town and quite the mystery it is.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir is a wild ride from start to finish. It doesn’t have a super deep message to give really, but it’s good edgy fun with some nice heartfelt, emotional moments sometimes. Ultimately, the premise is unique enough and the mystery is thrilling enough to keep you invested I’d say. I’d say at least give it 3-4 episodes, before you decide to drop it.<br />
<br />
--Characters--<br />
<br />
The cast of characters while not being super unique, are well rounded and likeable enough to enjoy. Any characters that might be considered annoying are usually very minor characters, and aren’t important at all to the plot.The character designs of the transformations I would certainly say are unique though. The various “monsters” , especially the more important ones, have some really cool designs and powers. <br />
<br />
Out of our 2 MC’s (AKA Shuichi and Clair), Clair is the much more interesting and compelling one out of the 2. Shuichi is a fine character, but his role in the story is more him trying to find his purpose in life, who he is as a person, and also being the weapon/tool Clair uses to fight with. He’s your typical weak nerd that eventually grows a spine. He has some good moments, but I would say while they’re technically equally important to the story, the story puts much more emphasis on Clair.<br />
<br />
Clair on the other hand works very well as a strong willed female protag. A lot of people are just going to see her as fap material or maybe even a discount Yuno Gasai, but fanservice aside, do you want a good character? You got a pretty good one that gets great development. She starts off as this seemingly half suicidal loon that is willing to do anything to get more info on these coins, but as the series progresses you get to learn what really makes her tick and what kind of person she is. She falls a bit into the crazy yandere trope, but she’s more just reckless and ruthless than outright insane and murder crazy. Her relationship with Shuichi is actually kind of cute, and isn’t just “I love you for no reason so I can appeal to some filthy weeb self inserting”. I mean there is a bit of that, but that’s more on the fanservice side of things. She is willing to forsake all kinds of morals and ethics to get what she wants, but she also cares for those around her and since she basically has nothing to lose she’s willing to do some terrible things even if she deep down would rather not. <br />
<br />
The rest of the cast ranges from generic and tropey to actually good as characters. The side cast of the protags are fairly generic outside of one character who becomes important about halfway through. The antagonists are a good bit more fleshed out but are a tad generic outside of the actual main villain and a girl with deep relations to both our MC’s. I will say my fave characters outside of the MC’s were Erena and Yoshioka. Sanbe (sickest transformation just meh personality), Alien, &amp; the gang leader were alright too. <br />
<br />
--Animation--<br />
<br />
Honestly, very surprised this got the quality animation it got. Not to say the manga is bad or anything, but it’s certainly not popular enough to get the type of animation it has got. There are some new scenes that add some nice minor depth to the characters and story. Fights that were only a few pages in the manga get greatly expanded on especially the one in the 2nd episode. The fights themselves are well choreographed, and have a very satisfying weight to them. Like you can really feel the characters getting hit, and it’s fairly brutal at times. Miscellaneous stuff that would normally not be shown like changing clothes or walking to a destination are actually included and well animated too. I don’t have much to say about the animation, just know it’s great. Like probably way better than this series deserved.<br />
<br />
--Music--<br />
<br />
I don’t know who was in the studio making these tracks, but they are catchy as heck. The music in Gleipnir ranges from atmospheric rumblings to hardcore EDM style fight music. You get some chill, almost Vaporwave like songs, and some chilling, near horror like tracks to just add to the thrills and mystery. And uh...ok I’m not really that good at describing music. I just know I really love what I hear, and it sets the mood perfectly for the series. Just trust me on this, it’s a good freaking soundtrack. <br />
<br />
--Overall Enjoyment--<br />
I quite liked Gleipnir a lot. The manga isn’t that great I’d say, but the anime has elevated it to a level I honestly say it’s a good series imo. Literally the only thing the manga has over the anime is of course continuing the story and bare breasts. Again no masterpiece, but a solid 8/10 anime with a unique enough premise you would probably enjoy it. <br />

    Why Gleipnir?<br />
In Norse mythology, Gleipnir means the &quot;open one&quot;. Gleipnir is the binding that holds the mighty wolf Fenrir (the first son of the God Loki). Fenrir was so strong, that even the Gods were afraid of the power of the wolf God. They attempted to bind Fenrir twice before with huge chains of metal, but Fenrir was able to break free both times. Therefore, they commissioned the dwarves to forge a chain that was impossible to break. To create a chain to achieve the impossible, the dwarves fashioned the chain out of six supposedly impossible to fashion things, and so the chain able to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346136">
        bind the being, even the Gods were afraid of, was created.<br />
 <br />
Generic Storyline<br />
Kagaya Shuuichi is not just a high school student. His sense of smell is incredibly developed, on top of that, he can also transform into an incredibly strong creature. He tries, however, to hide his little secret from everyone. One day, Shuuichi decides to use his power to save a girl. This is the end of his calm life.<br />
 <br />
Fascinating Psychological Thriller That Later Resembles Erotic Comedy<br />
It is difficult to make a good psychological thriller, because it is supposed to be disturbing. It should make you feel uncomfortable to the point that you will never forget what you are watching. The best examples for it are the first arc of Death Note and the first season of Psycho-Pass. But is Gleipnir good enough for you to remember this series? It is not. Gleipnir is tagged as seinen, not shounen, but I know shounen that are darker that Gleipnir. You will remember, however, women&#039;s underwear, when watching this series, thus it is tagged ecchi. On top of that, the main protagonist of the series nearly sexually assaults the girl he saves, because of the fact that he cannot control himself, when he becomes a plush monster that looks anything but scary. But the girl he saves, keeps being half-naked all the time for some reason.<br />
 <br />
Nudity Is Not Issue<br />
You might remember a rape scene in the beginning of the Garden of sinners Chapter 3: Remaining Sense of Pain. Was it bad? Absolutely not. It only added a grain of horror and made the movies such a success. So it is absolutely fine to use nudity, but it should not be overused. Here, however, when watching the series you feel that the author wants you to pay all the attention you have to Aoki Kurea, who is most of the time half-naked. What I mean is that the story of this series asks many questions, which are important for the understanding of this series, yet gives hardly any reasonable explanations for the viewer to understand what the storyline is about.<br />
 <br />
It Does Look Sexy<br />
As it has already been stated before, one of the genres of this show is ecchi, so expect a heavy focus on fanservice, which this series does a lot and I should say that the series does manage to show some sexy images. So as an ecchi, it does its job well, let us omit the fact that Aoki Kurea bust size is always different, we live in difficult times. Action scenes, however, look somewhat flawed and messy, but are still somewhat enjoyable.<br />
 <br />
Average OST/Awesome Voice Acting<br />
The series has quite good voice actors, who do make this anime somewhat memorable, however, the OST is just awfully bad; it is supposed to build up suspension, here, however, you only want it to end as soon as possible.<br />
 <br />
Fetishes Even Pornographic Film Studios Will Be Jealous Of<br />
I will try to avoid the details about the characters as much as possible to avoid spoilers, but there are still many things to address. Kagaya Shuuichi is just boring. ‘I do not want to hurt people, because people die when they are killed. I do not want to hurt people, yet, I do not mind hanging out with a chick that is always half-naked’. Which would have been absolutely okay, have the author mentioned it in any of the episodes. The problem, however, is that most of the development gets that psychotic, nymphomaniac chick that randomly changes her bust size sometimes. Do not get me wrong, the problem here is that both protagonists should get a somewhat similar development for the series to be watchable.<br />
 <br />
Criticism<br />
If this series main aim was to show nudity and be nothing but a fap material, which this series tries to be, I would have had absolutely no problem with this series. However, it tries to be a pornographic movie, which is okay as such, but it also tries to show an interesting, dark and disturbing scenes and it fails miserably, trying to shift the viewer&#039;s focus on different fetishes: girl that enters her male partner, each and every dialogue scene shows female genitals and that is pretty much what this anime is about. <br />
<br />
Overall<br />
I will not hide the fact that the show did have potential to be creepy and even unique and I will not lie but I am disappointed. As it has already been mentioned many times in my review, it is totally okay to use nudity and even some fetishes that some might regard as &#039;this is too much&#039;. But the problem here is not to overuse it, which this series does a lot; it tries to shift your attention from the storyline and characters to fan service.<br />
 <br />
Can I Recommend This Show?<br />
It depends. If you are looking for something that makes sense: an interesting storyline that makes sense and likable characters, I highly doubt this is what you are looking for. However, if you are looking for one hell of a weird ecchi show, with some crazy fetishes, this might be what you are looking for.

    I&#039;ll be brief: THEY HAD TO LITERALLY INSERT A SPINE INTO THE MAIN CHARACTER FOR STORY TO HAPPEN.<br />
<br />
I say follow with rule of 3 with this one, if it doesn&#039;t hook you by than, it won&#039;t later either.<br />
<br />
MC is so god damn useless that story can&#039;t progress without him having powers to let someone else do his job. While the story is interesting it&#039;s not that unique when you think about it. Basically, this is reverse Darling in the Franxx. But with more edge. And somehow with even more sexual theme of fights.<br />
<br />
Story - 7/10 - For now &#039;cause I don&#039;t really have to go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337216">
        on here. <br />
Art - 9/10 - Surprised with the level of work put into the fights, very good. I&#039;m also liking character design. <br />
Sound -  7/10 - Nothing stands out for me but at least overall voice acting and osts are fitting and well done. <br />
Character - 4/10 - With all the pain in my heart. Lead female is a great balance between crazy and hot, would love to see more of her, but the male lead is.... everything that&#039;s bad about this. He&#039;s the LEAST interesting part about this thing and has overall very negative influence on atmosphere and story. And I give 0 crap about his past, he&#039;s too unlikable for me to like even after a &#039;redemption/flashback&#039; arc. <br />
Enjoyment - 8/10 - I want crap like this every season. <br />
<br />
Overall - 7/10 - If they don&#039;t ruin anything else besides MC it&#039;s probably gonna end up good.<br />

    A simp anime, the &quot;hero&quot; serves the girl like a good dog and will help her obviously and is not even respected, how we got there, to have animes like that... <br />
Would it be possible to have animes with male characters who are not going to help girls&#039; problems and who are respected? &#039;Cause this is getting really annoying. And about the story it’s beyond the ridiculous, the main character has no background it’s empty, all he does is help the girl, that’s really the story, then there are monsters coming out of nowhere, nothing is explained and the monster designs are really ridiculous

    Every season there&#039;s always at least one anime where you can&#039;t help but think: damn, this anime is terrible in every way possible! What a waste of resources creating this, and what a waste of time watching this! Upon superficial viewing, Gleipnir may seem like this type of series, one where you just don&#039;t know what is going on in the creator&#039;s right mind. However, this is in fact, not the case.<br />
<br />
In reality, Gleipnir is a gripping psychological drama with a hint of a beautiful romance. The title itself should already be enough to draw you in. &#039;What the fuck does Gleipnir mean?&#039; I bet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337382">
        that&#039;s what you&#039;re wondering. Don&#039;t worry, this is not explained at all during the first 3 episodes of the show, nor are any important plot points, as this important info shall serve as a device to evoke suspense and urge the viewers who care enough to continue with the show.<br />
<br />
The characters are also very nice, and their chemistry is the most organic. We have the blonde main bitch who is always trying to get &quot;inside&quot; the male protagonist. Yes you read that right, get &quot;inside.&quot; Apparently the male MC is able to turn into this large stuffed animal which the female can enter, character design of utmost peculiarity. She doesn&#039;t beat around the bush at all with this guy, and starts going at it from like the 2nd ep, making remarks afterwards like: &quot;I pissed myself while inside you, just joking&quot; (haha) or &quot;my body is being moved, gross&quot; to which the male responds with &quot;it&#039;s gross for me too.&quot; Like ffs just get married already<br />
<br />
The characters are deep and well-developed. Their personal dilemmas are almost immediately presented in the first few eps, with the blonde being suicidal and found some new goal in life by toying with this stuffed toy guy, who is also lost in life and unsure of what college to attend etc etc. The girl becomes completely infatuted with controlling this guy&#039;s inner beast, but there already existed a short redhead already in love with this guy, forming a dramatic love triangle. How could it be better? A THIRD girl comes in who is in fact the first girl&#039;s big sister, who is also somehow in love with the male protagonist. (it&#039;s confusing ik but it all makes sense when u watch it!)<br />
<br />
The pacing is painful to experience, not because it&#039;s bad, but because the show has got me so emotionally invested. We go from one scene where the female is taking her time getting inside him to another fight scene with insane fight choreography and animation. One second I&#039;m crying and squirming to the cute romance and the next I&#039;m in awe at the production quality and direction! I can&#039;t keep up with this dynamic show. Not gonna lie the fighting is actually epic as hell, but I just can&#039;t tell what the show is trying to become.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir may seem like the type of show that is complete trash, but think twice. The meant-to-be-emotional scenes have plenty of irony/satire value to appreciate, and the fighting scenes are just awesome. Some shows exist just to be enjoyed/made fun of and not to be taken seriously. I suggest giving this a watch if you are having a bad day and want to laugh and cry with these MCs.

    Action, ecchi, mystery, sci-fi, battle royales. If any of the following interest you, you’ll like Gleipnir. It was easily one of my favourite shows from Spring 2020 and was a fun time throughout.<br />
<br />
 For me, the ideal anime is one that blends a lot of lewd fan service with a good story and characters. Gleipnir managed to do that very well. I understand fan service and edgy story set ups are not for everyone, and if you are opposed to that, you will probably not enjoy this. <br />
<br />
From the very first episode, the series managed to hook me with its interesting premise and mystery. Every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346141">
        week I was on the edge of my seat waiting for a new episode to drop and find out more of what was going on with the story. I’ve not seen any other battle royal anime besides this and Darwin’s Game, so the concept is fresh to me and very enjoyable. <br />
<br />
I really don’t have too many criticisms of the show as I’m pretty easy to please. Some might argue that the MC is a bit bland or that the show is overly edgy, those things don’t bother me much. I watch and rate purely on enjoyment and I had a blast with this one. The story feels unique and hooks you pretty early on. <br />
<br />
Action sequences are well animated with nice character designs and art. OST is well done and added to a lot of the scenes. <br />
<br />
If I had to change anything about this show, I would make it longer. The pacing is fine, but it just really felt like an extra few episodes could have fleshed the story out better. This, like most anime, was mainly a set up to get people into reading the manga. It certainly worked on me. I’ll be sticking with this series for a while to come.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir gets 8 coins out of 10 from me.<br />

    I have read or currently up to date with the manga. <br />
So, compare to the other reviews to the series, this opinion does not come from the Anime per se but the show as a whole.<br />
Don&#039;t worry I will try my best not to mess the enjoyment for you and let&#039;s avoid spoilers but IF you are in any way interested in it, I would advice you to go ahead and read for yourself.<br />
<br />
Should you watch Gleipnir?<br />
Short answer: YES.<br />
Long answer: It depends on your taste. Not for kids. Not for Shounen fanatics. For starters, let&#039;s get something clear. This is a series not for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337588">
        faint of heart, be it for being an ecchi series and for the several adult themes touch within the show itself.<br />
Therefore if you are expecting a lighthearted series, then this could not be what you were looking for.<br />
Then again, if you are more refined and have a broader and wider scope of what you tend to watch, as in you don&#039;t limit yourself to a specific genre, by all means don&#039;t let me stop you.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s address the main concerns first:<br />
Art &amp; Animation: Very appealing 8/10. Very fluent 9/10. Color palette and light usage creates a more grim atmosphere that raises the tension and suspense.<br />
Sound: OP is catchy and good 8/10, but aside to that nothing that memorable. Sound is not really the most important anyway.<br />
Enjoyment: Subjective. It all comes down to what I pointed out to you before.<br />
Story: ¿? By the knowledge of the source material. Yes. It&#039;s a very well written and constructed universe.<br />
Character: This is by far the most ambiguous. Some people say that the MC is a crybaby. They are not wrong though. The other question is, does it get development. Yes. A lot.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s go with personal biased opinion:<br />
<br />
A Youtuber said this series is Trash... <br />
Why?<br />
Let&#039;s define &quot;Trash&quot;: Garbage. Something Worth little or nothing. <br />
Therefore, for all purposes, in Anime media, being called Trashy show it would mean things along these lines, not worth mentioning or watching and a big waste of your time.<br />
 <br />
I believe that is a severe critique, albeit everyone is entitled to their opinion, I do not think is fair to say a series is either good or bad based of first impressions, due to the fact it lacks the knowledge and the full picture of what has been evaluated.<br />
On top of the fact that people tend to make off comparisons.<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s clear some common mistakes:<br />
<br />
No. It&#039;s not a Battle Royale per se. <br />
This is properly explained in the story. <br />
So if people tell you that, please compare it to the most obvious example, the Fate Franchise. <br />
The most recognizable Battle Royale series ever.<br />
As you can see, way different concept.<br />
<br />
The other wrong comparison, Clair/Kurea is an offbrand cheap imitation of Gasai Yuno.<br />
No. Just, no.<br />
First of all. Mirai Niki&#039;s Gasai Yuno IS a 100% Yandere. Second Yuno &amp; Yukiteru are the exact representation of the Lima &amp; Stockholm Syndrome. Hence way different characters.<br />
I am being as vague as possible because I am trying to avoid spoilers regarding the characters themselves.<br />
But just to point out a fundamental trait it would allow you to see how different they really are. <br />
<br />
Then we say that this series is Trash for the use of Fan Service.<br />
This is a Seinen series. Young adult is the target audience.<br />
If Fan Service is a resource and not the main plot point. <br />
If it&#039;s seldom shown and is not the main focus and it&#039;s whole purpose is adding a little bit of taste to the scene is not bad. <br />
Also, the rating for this should is R - Mild Nudity. <br />
Fan Service is kind of expected.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t like it, if you think that is not really for you, don&#039;t watch it because you will not enjoy it.<br />
<br />
This is also a Thriller &amp; Psychological. <br />
Those along should give a major idea of what the story is really about.<br />
<br />
And the dumbest reason why people say this show is off putting:<br />
Clair is a bad character because she has freckles.<br />
The irony is that you also hear that Karen from Tower of God is so cute because of the exact same reason.<br />
Yes, really. That is a thing.<br />
No. Just, no.<br />
A woman with freckles looks pretty and cute. <br />
Women with freckles and big breasted should rule the world.<br />
So if you are a woman with that trait, or you are a guy who is attracted to this trait, A+ to you.<br />
<br />
So with all the odd reasons out of the way...<br />
Why should you watch Gleipnir?<br />
<br />
Meet our 3 protagonist Shuichi, Clair and her older sister Elena.<br />
Yes, Elena is also the protagonist of the series.<br />
<br />
Shuichi is our &quot;Not so protagonist of the story&quot; MC.<br />
At first glance, he seems to be wimpy, scary, skinny, glasses-kun, run of the mill kind of guy that you find almost in every other show.<br />
So why is he special? Why should he become special? <br />
Well that is to be seen and is the main point of the story so if I just flat out tell the reason then where is the fun in that.<br />
Clair on the other hand, is everything that Shuichi is not.<br />
Clair has massive... Confidence. Feisty. Strong minded. Badmouthed. Relentless. Hence, she is hot AF.<br />
One provides what the other one lacks and viceversa.<br />
Their dynamic is full of double meaning conversations and almost all the time is Clair imposing on Shuichi.<br />
Oddly enough, it fits. <br />
It sets the tone of the series. They don&#039;t have a normal relationship. <br />
The norm should be Senpai-Kohai, since Clair is younger than Shuichi.<br />
Maybe lovers? <br />
Neither one of those criterias fit them. At least, nothing so shallow.<br />
They are comrades, sharing a common goal. <br />
Therefore using each other instead of helping each other would be more accurate.<br />
<br />
What about Elena?<br />
The main female protagonist role is more for her than Clair&#039;s.<br />
Not even the source material has clarify her story completely though.<br />
Describing Elena as a character, her connection to Shuichi and her motives cannot be done unless spoilers are given.<br />
Although her meek, mellow and bashful persona in front of the MC should have given you enough hints.<br />
Suffice to say, that she is the most complex character in the series.<br />
<br />
What is Gleipnir about and why should I care to watch it?<br />
Have you ever had a dream? <br />
Have you ever thought that you wanted to change something about yourself or about the people around you?<br />
The one beneath the facade that you wear, is that the real you? <br />
Is that who you wanted to be? To become the shield of those you wanted to protect, or to become the puppet for others to be used for because you lack the courage to do it yourself?<br />
Will you become happy and satisfied after your dream has been granted?<br />
<br />
This is an emotional and psychological mindbreak &amp; turmoil. <br />
In order to stop all the events that are currently affecting all the people around the MC, he will have to become the exact opposite of what he stands for.<br />
Will he be able to retain his humanity in the process? Will he remain the good guy or will he become shrouded in the darkness?<br />
Clair&#039;s despair and Shuichi&#039;s acceptance of madness. To fight the evil around him and within him. To obtain the redemption and absolution of his past mistakes and sins.<br />
That is basically the foundation of the hero and the main point of the story... <br />

    First here&#039;s my previously removed &quot;review&quot;<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t waste your time. It&#039;s total shit. The creators just wanted this sadistic girl last for more than an episode and that&#039;s the only reason the MC hasn&#039;t eaten her which would&#039;ve solved all the problem. Absolutely atrocious series judging by only the first episode. Why couldn&#039;t they just talk it through? Why does it have to be a totally wimpy MC? If you want some series with decently developed characters, with interesting story where events happen because it&#039;s necessary, and not because creators thought it would be cool to add - that is not for you.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337327">
        second episode<br />
Yep. Confirmed. This is a Mirai Nikki rip-off. A wimpy schoolboy as the MC and a strong-willed partner that helps him save his life.<br />
<br />
Third episode.<br />
All of a sudden he&#039;s not as whimpy as before. I&#039;d say the studio missed the WHOLE 24-episode series explaining this transformation. The anime is getting worse and worse.<br />
<br />
Fourth episode.<br />
The background of the story has finally been claryfied. I can&#039;t believe the studio hasn&#039;t started the series with this one, or at least with some fusion of the four released episodes. The MC keeps on changing at light speed - the only downside. But overall the episode is suprisingly good. If the creators continue the production without the chaos of the previous episodes, it would be nice.

    I think this anime deserves way more credit than people are saying. I feel though others are bandwagons for things that they haven’t even seen. When I went to look at the ratings before watching(like on YouTube and MAL), the ratings really did draw me off from watching. I saw people describe this anime before even the 4th episode even came out Making it seem TOTAllY different from what is it. I highly request for people to give this a try. Even “i” had my doubts and it is saddening to me that people give this a bad score because they base it off others

        or they are uncomfortable with the provocative scenes when this anime has a lot more to offer. <br />
I really do feel the most popular review on this cite does Do a HUGE disservice. This anime has character, action, and a great concept. Pacing is great as well, not at any moment was I bored or drawn of from the story. I truly believe that most of the bad reviews are from the “Karen’s” of anime, And that this anime doesn’t deserve that kind of energy as it discourages others from watching(including myself). If it weren’t for the genuine reviews that convinced me to watch I would have never discovered this hidden gem. I believe this anime is a Contender as top spring anime right beside tower of good. After watching the anime and seeing the reviews I had to make an account and voice my opinions.

    Gleipnir suffers from the “Fire Force Syndrom” where the main cast is so unbelievably stronger or smarter than the villains that you start to wonder why there’s even a conflict to begin with. I know Fire Force isn’t the first of its kind to do something like this but unlike some other shows, it&#039;s most frustrating when the concept of the show is really interesting. However, unlike Fire Force, everything else about this show also falls flat.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr Gleipnir started out pretty promising but slowly as time went on went from “decent” to nonsensical in about 6 episodes then stayed at that level for the rest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346131">
        of the journey. It MIGHT might be considered a “show that really isn’t for everyone” but I really can’t imagine a single thing that this show does that isn’t mediocre at BEST. I’d recommend you stay away from this anime.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
<br />
I have no idea how they turned a story of a dude transforming into a mascot with superpowers boring… but they did.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir’s story started out SUPER interesting but eventually as it slogs on you start to realize how barebone it truly is which is a trend that we see throughout the whole experience. You start to feel invested just to get dragged out of the story due to really weird coincidences, strange plot developments, or characters acting nonsensically. Characters being the biggest drawback in the anime, tearing down the story instead of lifting it up (save for one or two notable examples). <br />
<br />
Art: 5<br />
<br />
Probably the only “mediocre” thing about this whole show<br />
<br />
The first three episodes were where the show was at its greatest in terms of art with smooth animation, only problem was the relatively generic character design, but a character doesn’t have to be the most unique for the show to be good. Slowly but surely, however, the animation quality started going down as the action sequences became more scarce and shorter until you’re left with almost nothing. <br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
<br />
ngl the opening was kind of a banger…<br />
<br />
This is probably the last compliment I can give to this show and even this is a stretch, the rest of the OST is extremely forgettable and repetitive. <br />
<br />
Character: 3<br />
<br />
Usually, a story is held together and carried by its character which is unfortunate because almost every character in this show is completely one dimensional and is either forgotten or killed before they ever get any plot development of any kind. Almost everyone is boring and flat and it feels like the entire cast is made up entirely of background characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1<br />
<br />
Nothing about this show is satisfactory, conflicts end in really bizarre ways, characters that seem like they should be important die in three seconds, the story either progresses at a snail&#039;s pace or dashes by so fast you can’t even comprehend what just happened. It’s not fun to watch and it&#039;s not even that fun to make fun of. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall 3.4 Rounded down to 3<br />
<br />
<br />
If I had one compliment to give this show is that it kept me watching every episode despite how much I didn’t like it. <br />
<br />

    This show has very interesting concepts handled pretty terribly, which saddens me because on paper it shows promise. Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
The basis of the plot is pretty interesting, involving an alien ship that crashed on earth. This particular alien race doesn&#039;t have a material body, so they have their minds stored inside coins. One of the aliens offers humans cool anime powers in exchange for finding his friends, who are scattered around the general area of the crash site. The powers each person gets are based on their innermost desires/fears/complexes, whatever. You get the idea. Yeah, it&#039;s not air-tight, but it&#039;s pretty interesting. On

          <span style="display: none;" id="review342881">
        the technical side, the animation is good and the action scenes are very well done.<br />
<br />
And then it royally fucks itself over. The plot revolves around a boy and a girl who are caught up in this mess, but it goes nowhere and only serves as an excuse to have people fight each other with very badly done build up. It does tease a deeper mystery involving the main character, because a yandere chick wiped his memories. This is, yet again, nothing more than an excuse to withhold seemingly important information from us, but anyone with half a brain can guess what it is, and it&#039;s not that good anyway.<br />
<br />
My biggest issue by far are the god-awful characters, with the main duo as the most serious offenders. Shuichi (our main boi) is your typical wimpy, depressed, pussy-ass anime protagonist who can&#039;t do jack shit unless Claire (the main girl) is there to hold his hand. He&#039;s indecisive, allows the plot to jerk him around, and makes for an overall annoying protagonist because even when he does do something, it&#039;s either his powers going haywire or plot armour that force him to take action. He then promptly reverts back to his timid ways, negating whatever growth or proactive nature he previously showed. Claire is even worse. She&#039;s a gorgeous goddess with a rocking bod who is Light Yagami levels of clever, only the creator of Gleipnir isn&#039;t, so you can smell the plot armour bullshit whenever you think about her actions for more than two seconds. She always rises to whatever occasion and hijacks every scene she&#039;s in, because she&#039;s that awesome. By the way, she&#039;s 15 and always way less experienced than her opponent in whatever situation they are in, so her comfortably pulling a win out of her ass every time is very frustrating to watch. Everyone else is pretty much one dimensional and acts only in manners that serve to either further the plot or make Clair look good, often without rhyme or reason.<br />
<br />
After seeing the personalities and interactions of the main duo I can only assume that the author, who is still around 14 years old mentally, basically wrote Shuichi to be a reflection of himself, and Claire to be the perfect girlfriend he always wishes he had. I get the fantasy, but it&#039;s a really boring experience for anyone who isn&#039;t in the centre of said fantasy, or is older than 15. Also, I want to talk about Shuichi&#039;s powers, which involve him transforming into a dog-mascot suit thing with a gun, and allowing someone to wear him. Whoever does so controls his actions, but it&#039;s mostly Claire. The entire thing is very sexual, with the insides of the suit looking, feeling, and sounding like the innards of someone&#039;s body, and Shuichi garnering pleasure from the process, both physically and mentally. This screams &quot;fetish&quot;, and I suppose that it would get off whoever has similar thoughts/needs, but I was unable to take it as seriously as the show wanted me to, if at all.<br />
<br />
So, yeah. I didn&#039;t like it.

    I&#039;m willing to bet that most of the people that picked this show up, did it because of either the amazingly-animated fight or because of the tasteless fanservice that accomodates most of Clair&#039;s screentime. For me it was both, and while the bad rating had me on guard, I honestly did not expect it to be this bad. If I had to find one phrase to describe this it would be &quot;A waste of good production&quot;. That fight was the only thing this show had going for it and that&#039;s exactly why it makes me so sad...<br />
<br />
Story/Characters:<br />
Awful. Horrible. Disgusting. I can&#039;t even find the courage

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338326">
        to describe this abomination to which I am subjected every week. It honestly pisses me off to think that someone got paid for writing this and yet... Our main character is your run-of-the mill loser that has the power to transform into a big teddy dog thing, along with a great smell ability, in a sense making him closer to a non-teddy dog thing. Most of his character so far revolves around his perpetual mental breakdown over &quot;losing his humanity&quot; even though he can freely transform back to his normal self as he wishes. The other main character is a sadistic bitch that&#039;s seemingly written as to be as hated by the viewers as much as possible and then the writer tries to make us sympathize with her or whatever. Long story short, the plot is all over the place, the characters are soulless and the epitome of bad writing, their interactions shallow and cringeworthy and generally this whole thing is akin more to a crappy fanfic than a professional manga that deserves an anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
This is the part that&#039;s the saddest about this show. The animation is good. The character designs are well-done, backgrounds are good albeit nothing too special, but the fight choreography and animation clarity is so good, it wouldn&#039;t be a stretch to say it&#039;s the best out of all this season&#039;s shows. Pine Jam is a literally who studio that has made only a handful more, borderline relevant shows, none of which had been action shows (they were actually pretty average), so I really must wonder what they would put had they worked with proper good source material. Well I guess their work does put a positive dent into this atrocity.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I&#039;m not someone that desperately seeks for &quot;deep&quot; shows with intricate plots and complex characters. Sure I definitely appreciate those but I believe myself to be just as capable of putting my brain to sleep and enjoying a chill feel-good show or a show with good action. However even as I try to do just that with Gleipnir, my brain is rudely awakened every few moments to scream &quot;What ?!&quot; or &quot;Why ?!&quot;. This show is not something uninteresting, it&#039;s something bad. It gets unbelievably cringy at times and briefly siphons away the smidgen of enjoyment that it managed to build up.<br />
<br />
I get sad even thinking what kind of good manga was sentenced to not receive an anime adaptation just so that this obscenity could.

    This shit was garbage alright, but I thought it was going to be the type of garbage that I would enjoy like of which the Highschool of the Dead. Don’t get me wrong, the first half of this show was enjoyable. It had an interesting premise, fights, ecchi fanservice, etc. The second half of this show was where it fell apart for me. <br />
<br />
What initially was going to be about an adventure between a boy named Shuuichi and a yandere girl named Clair to find out the reasons behind her sister’s murdering of her parents, to the boring stale talking about nonsense with maybe a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346285">
        few actions here and there. <br />
<br />
The show started it off strong. We were introduced to the main male protagonist Shuuichi who was bestowed with an ability to turn into a monster that resembles a teddy bear. This ability gives him an abnormal amount of strength, power, and agility. However, he doesn’t know how to use this power to his advantage -- at least effectively. This is where Clair, the main female protagonist, comes in. You see, she’s the yandere of this show, but not too extreme like the which of Yuno Gaisai. And she has a motivation that is at least understandable, unlike Yuno. Just like any Yandere, she is badass, cool, sexy, and can knock you out in one punch. She’s also merciless. If you rubbed her in the wrong way, you might as well be dead. What’s her involvement with Shuuichi? Well, she pilots Shuuichi’s monster.    <br />
<br />
Clair can pilot Shuuich’s monster form by going inside the body of the monster. That’s right, when Shuuichi is in his monster form, people can get inside it. However, just like any living beings, the monster’s inside is always hot and humid like a sultry day. Thus, you will always see her wearing bikinis or swimsuits because you know, for fanservice. And yes, there will be plenty of ass shots. <br />
<br />
The premise of this show sounds all fine and dandy until the show introduced aliens. That’s right, ALIENS. Instead of focusing on finding the truth behind Clair’s sister, we have to follow our two main protagonists’ journeys finding these alien coins, basically the MacGuffins of this show. These alien coins are needed to be collected and delivered to the guy -- who’s an alien -- at some random vending machine somewhere in Japan. The thing is, what happens after they delivered the coins? Will the alien tell Clair about the truth of her sister? Or will the alien use the coins to summon an alien invasion? We don’t know. The show just introduces some of these random asspulls to explain these powers for the sake of explanation. What’s next? A full-blown war with other aliens? Fuck this show. <br />
<br />
After the reveal of aliens, the pacing of this show slumped. It went from pure action to stale talking after Clair and Shuuichi joined a useless clan of people who can turn into all sorts of things. They have a common goal: collect as many alien coins as possible. Along the way, they fight other clans for domination. However, in all of these fights, Clair and Shuuichi were the only effective ones, the rest of Clair and Shuuichi’s clan were just useless.<br />
<br />
This show’s production quality is surprisingly outstanding. Especially with the smoothness of the action scenes. Outside of that, the attention to background details, character designs, and lighting was mediocre. <br />
<br />
This show isn’t worth watching because for the majority of the time there aren’t many things going on. The dialogues are plain and servers pretty much no purpose. Unless you’re in for full ecchi, it’s not an enjoyable show.  <br />

    So I never planned on watching this show. I thought the premise of turning into a monster was pretty rad until I saw all the screenshots and clips of him being a goddamn furry suit and being controlled by some psycho yandere. I don&#039;t recommend it. It may sound cool, but it&#039;s just weird and uncomfortable and terribly confusing.<br />
<br />
My roommate and I decided to watch this for shits and giggles. It&#039;s HORRID. There is all kinds of sexual harassment within the first episode alone! Fem MC is so hypersexualized for being around 15/16 years old and male MC is bland and weak-willed despite having his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341395">
        weird powers. The relationship between the two is nothing but blackmail and emotional manipulation.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of plot holes??? Like, I understand that vending machine guy will probably get explained later but what the fuck is the deal with the stupid coins? How did Elena get a second coin and why did she give it to Clair after MURDERING THEIR PARENTS?! If Elena turned into a monster while wearing her school uniform, how did Clair even get a hold of it?<br />
<br />
And the track n&#039; field girl? What was the point of her murder other than to provide a plot point for Clair to hop inside Shuichi&#039;s furry suit? She was literally one of the only leads to figuring out where the monsters and coins came from and they MURDERED her, then pretended like it didn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
I like gore and violence in anime but this is just a poor excuse for it. Half of the situations are pointless and a waste of time. And that one classmate of Shuichi&#039;s, Nana? What the fuck is up her? Is she just a &quot;love rival&quot;, despite having no true interaction or connection with Shuichi?<br />
<br />
I will give credit where it&#039;s due; the animation for the battle scenes is beautifully simplistic and flows nicely. The soundtrack for the show is not terrible - like something that fits the scenes but not something you&#039;d go out of your way to listen to, ya know?<br />
<br />
The concept of the monster wishes is wonderful and makes sense. As my roommate explained to me, their monster forms reflect the users wishes. The track n&#039; field girl wanted to be stronger, so her monster form allows her to be faster, stronger, just like she wanted. And Elena? She used her wish for Shuichi which is why he became a mascot, something to be controlled, and she became a shadow; essentially &quot;nothing&quot; as a result.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m gonna keep watching just so I can keep shitting on this piss-poor excuse of a psychological horror/drama.

    Ok, now hear me out, this shit is raunchy as all hell and if you don&#039;t like excessive gore, excessive violence, or excessive &quot;coincidences&quot;, then this show isn&#039;t for you, but if you want to just unwind, let your brain soak in some catharsis  and have a very strong immunity to all the above due to the fact that you&#039;ve been in the anime community long enough to know about this website then you&#039;ll probably have a good time. There are some pitfalls that other people watching this show have put themselves into though that can taint there experience of the show. One don&#039;t

        try to put yourself in the protagonist shoes and live in this world through him, there are shows out there for those who like doing that with super cool and awesome protagonist but Shuichi and Kurea are just real people in this world that you can relate and empathize with, but they are first and foremost there own people. They have there own personalities that you get to know and love throughout the series. Dos don&#039;t come expecting a traditional story either, this is no hero beat the big bad villain isekai, this is just everyone trying to accomplish there own goals with the action only happening because of people helping or hindering each others goals, its a psychological thriller not some shounen arc of the number 1 hero bro. That being said this is a great anime to watch

    My personal opinion on this Anime is it&#039;s Overdone, The Anime trying too much to make everything unique/unusual/weird, and by everything i mean &quot;EVERYthing&quot;. <br />
From mcs odd character to scenes trying to make you amazed, and for some people or younger new audience this could work wonderfully because it blew their mind. <br />
But for me i cannot buy it, its just too much of a mess. paired with load and load of sexual innuendos and ecchi scenes which I usually don&#039;t care about, but at this point it&#039;s this show main selling point.<br />
The Fight Scenes and Art is above average by today standard, but not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337307">
        special<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not hard to guess why people who did, like this show, to sum it up It is &quot;male fantasy with supporting premise&quot; and I&#039;am sure many will hate it for the same reason, and that&#039;s fine because if you can enjoy a show then good for you, Or if you don&#039;t, just let the people who enjoy it enjoy it.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
<br />
This show is About a teenage boy who one day suddenly get an ability to transform without himself knowing the reason why. this boy is weak willed and try not to stand out &quot;At all&quot;, He also really really nice and doesn&#039;t want to do bad things, you get it. This boy also very smart, but I&#039;ve forgotten that he&#039;s supposed to be smart by the half of first episode. The only normal aspect of his character is his teenage boy sexual desire. Some people doesn&#039;t like this kind of Mc and is a dealbreaker. For me its whatever if it contribute to the plot and/or its necessary for the plot and character development/interaction with other characters.<br />
<br />
The other main character is a girl which nothing much could be said about beside she&#039;s almost emotionless, weird and little bit crazy. I find it hard to relate too both Mc especially the girl(But she&#039;s there not for you to relate to, she can just strip and there all the persona you need).<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
The ecchi scene are good, if you like ecchi then you would enjoy this show more, but for more mature audience there are too many ecchi scenes in one episode so you cannot just ignore it<br />
I cant stop thinking of The MC superpower while it is unique it is also for the sake of ecchi.<br />
There&#039;s no strong reason for the Mc to fight other than helping the girl, but sometimes the reason isn&#039;t what necessary to be enjoyable watch, What make this a hard watch is compilation of all the things the show presented

    Well, it is not today that we see shows that deceive by their relevance in debates in the forums.  It has become common to see not-so-good animes stand out, while others that need more attention cease to be seen, precisely because of their not-so-good numbers, when it comes to popularity.  Sword Art Online, Mirai Nikki and Darling in the Franxx are clear examples of too popular animes.  While there are established shows that are not even commented on: Monster, PPTA, Tatamy Galaxy, etc.  Where do I want to go?  Is that Gleipnir was one of the anime that backfired and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365785">
        will always be remembered, whatever the anime did.<br />
<br />
Gleipnir is the type of anime that divides opinions between the anime of the season.  Whether for the story, or for the relevance that the anime had, the show was constantly questioned about what different it would bring (besides the dog costume, of course).  The anime has a clear difference between being the darling of many and having an absolutely weak and dull story.  I felt it myself a lot while watching.<br />
<br />
At first, we saw a pair that met by &quot;chance&quot; and decided to fight together for coins, that can make any wish come true (obviously, restrictions like resurrection exist, which is a positive aspect in the coherence of the story).  In the end, the anime left more questions than resolutions.  Shuichi&#039;s past, Alien&#039;s goals, confusing dramas and narrative have been punished over time and haven&#039;t resolved at all.  Neither the action scenes, nor the team coin search arc saves the anime.  Things were artificial, they gave no emotion and were uninteresting.  I&#039;ve seen this happen before, even this year, with Darwin&#039;s Game.  Gleipnir worsened the situation.  The dramas were not coherent and had many exaggerations.  All problems were solved with deaths, fights or something, it seems that the characters do not know how to talk harmoniously (the suicide scene was very uncomfortable).<br />
<br />
The end doesn&#039;t like it either, the quality only declines even more.  A bad resolution, which gave aspects of a &quot;coin hunt, part two&quot;.  And speaking of the coins, I didn&#039;t really understand their purpose.  Is it really a device used only to place orders?  Alien does not seem reliable.  Even in his dialogues with the other characters, all I understood was that he would need coins to rebuild his ship and return anywhere on the map.  But what would he gain from seeing a possible carnage happen in his eyes?  This is the most correct method to do?  Honoka should be feeling uneasy to see this in the sky ... No, wait!  Oh, never mind.  Even the &quot;death&quot; concept was broken and Honoka became a protector of Kaito.  It seems that the same consistency that I praised has been destroyed, doesn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t totally disregard the show, its first half is okay, because in addition to starting the work well, it managed to bring a darker side that perpetuated until the end.  In that sense, I did not feel an exaggeration, besides supporting the idea previously.  But I think that was left out in a very abrupt way, since the rest of the show just used confrontations as a way to explain who is the strongest among the characters.  A fake and very destructive technique, which degredolated Gleipnir.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t question the production, nor the staff&#039;s attempt to improve the anime, it was a decent job.  Sometimes, it is necessary to watch some work, even if it is bad, to appreciate the effort of those who made the anime.  It is a pity to see that they were unable to make the work good.  For me, Gleipnir is nothing more than a popular anime and that, again, will always be commented for having failed, when it comes to pretending to be good.  Even though it has more seasons, I don&#039;t think it will go to a good place in the end.  There is the manga, which has advanced things a little more ... but, frankly, I am so tired of your work, that I will wait some time to read the original material.  Overall, the anime only has good production and good opening and closing themes, because otherwise, it was a complete show of disinterest.
