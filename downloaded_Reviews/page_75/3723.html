    ----SPOILER FREE REVIEW----<br />
<br />
A T-rex professor, a homo girafe, an exhibitionist mole-rat, a hermaphrodite hyena, an unbreakable badger, a star panda, an ever-dying sloth and a pero-pero obsessed cute loli wolf. That’s just a little part of the mess that you can find in this hilarious and smooth anime. <br />
<br />
Murenase! Seton Gakuen or Seton Academy: Join the pack! has finally finished airing and damn, it was a blast all along. <br />
<br />
If you think that’s an uninteresting furry anime, you are missing something big time. Throughout my review I hope you will see this anime in a clearer light which is absolutely well-deserved.<br />
<br />
<br />
First a quick resume: Seton

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332487">
        Gakuen is a slice of life, comedy, school anime. Classic. Except there are only 2 humans in the entire school. Yes, all the other students are animals in the true sense of the word. <br />
<br />
The story follows Jin Mazama, our lonely human, as he enrolls into Seton Gakuen as a sophomore. Jin despite all animals (quite the height if you ask me), so what is his surprise when he encounters Hitomi Hino the beautiful second human-girl in the school. As his desires and dreams keep getting wilder, he stumbled across the path of a little pink ball of furry. That’s Ookami Ranka, our cute loli wolf whose dream is to build her own pack…starting with Jin! <br />
<br />
Now, let’s break out the different aspects:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story itself is quite simple as most of the comedy/school anime. While the story is simple, the show stays quite entertaining because once in a while, when a new animal is introduced or do their “specific animal things”, the narrator explains the “Did you know…?” in a funny way with instructive chibby drawings. Still good to take that general knowledge while laughing and be like “Wtf…?” ^^’ You will have some good anecdote to tell your friends who wouldn’t have known that their friend is an animal expert.<br />
Not much left to say about the story but you do have quite some surprises along the anime that you wouldn’t have think of.  – 8/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The characters design is quite simple for the animals, but they hit right on the spot. If you have followed your biology courses in school and watched 1 or 2 animal documentary you should be able to recognize most of the species shown (“And what if I watched Interspecies reviewers?” -Keep your mouth shut, pervert)<br />
Frequently it’s just the head and the body design in the uniform that are representative of the animal. From time to time it’s a human figure but with an animal part (ears or tail for example) and occasionally the whole body is shown. <br />
All the cast is well written, they are faithful to their specific and respective animals’ characteristics, so it brings many elements of humor throughout the show. – 8/10<br />
<br />
Animation: <br />
<br />
Now that’s the point I want to bring up. Seton Gakuen’s animation is clean af. The backgrounds are okay but what strikes the most is the details and the diversity of the animations of the cast. Just go take a glimpse at the opening to give you an idea. Did you ever see a more animated opening? Just be careful if you are epileptic. At first look, it seems like a giant mess (which is quite right to depict the f big zoo that is Seton’s school) but once you look closer you can see all the little things that proves that some work had been put into it. A lot of work.<br />
<br />
The movements are fluid and it’s simply great. The faces of the member of the casts are very expressive and can display a wide range of emotions. Studio Gokami which has done anime such as Tsurezure Children and Kiniro Mosaic did a great job for this anime.<br />
<br />
One thing I also want to point out is the fan-service. Maaaan there is little fan-service in this anime, but it’s done damn good. Trust me when I say that soon enough there will be Hitomi doujinshis popping out faster than the coronavirus cases. <br />
– 9/10<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The opening song is very catchy, that’s what you expect for this type of show and it’s done good! Meanwhile the ending song is a little troll (ever wondered what a crying wolf sound like?).<br />
<br />
The VA are on-point, they really fit their character. Sometimes they try to make their own animal noises which is really funny to listen. (Watch the previews!) – 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: <br />
<br />
Overall, I loved Seton Gakuen. Watching it with my friends got us bursts of laughter and we just simply had a really great time.  – 10/10<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
<br />
To conclude, Seton Gakuen is breath of fresh air in the comedy type of anime.  If you wanna have a fun time watching a short (but educational!) comedy filled with joy, love and drool from Ranka-Chan, why not grab your confinement kit and simply Join the Pack!!  <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!<br />

    How can you not love this show? It&#039;s fun from start to finish. Always giving me a number of laughs throughout each episode. You can say for sure. &#039;I&#039;ve joined the pack.&#039; You should too!<br />
<br />
While it might be weird in some sense, seeing the characters the way they are. With males looking like the animals, and the females looking like humanoid versions of them. But I see that as something different and to stand out. As for the characters themselves. Ranka is just a delight, she&#039;s so energetic, and protective wolf. A loveable dumbass. The sloth is just pure laughs really. so is Yukari for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327645">
        that matter. Hitomi is an angel, bless her. While poor Jin has to deal with all this, he&#039;s a good guy, but the way he reacts to things will always be funny to me.<br />
<br />
What I like about this show too, is that it stays true to animals in general, as in what real animals are like in sense of what they like and what not. I feel like that&#039;s a nice touch.<br />
<br />
The opening of the show is so catchy too, and it&#039;s a great listen. One of my favorite openings of the season for sure. It&#039;s so upbeat and great. Plus the opening itself is a laugh too. Ranka is speedy lol.<br />
<br />
The art is really great and well detailed. It really is good looking. The colours are bright and lovely to look at.<br />
<br />
Overall, you should check out this show! It&#039;s a bundle of laughs, and many more to come!

    This season so far has been really damn good for comedies. Interspecies Reviewers, RikeKoi, Eizouken, Oshi ga Budoukan, Bofuri and now Murenase! Seton Gakuen. This anime is by no means an absolute masterpiece, but it is really damn fun.<br />
<br />
The story follows Jin who lives in a world full of humanoid animals while himself being a human. Sadly, Jin absolutely despairs animals. It becomes even more complicated when Ranka, the cheerful wolf, wants Jin to join her pack. Jin at first refuses, but after the other human Hitomi creates a cooking club which Ranka calls her pack, Jin reluctantly joins. And with that, a bunch of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327643">
        antics ensue, featuring dinosaurs, lion love stories and naked mole rat-girls.  <br />
  <br />
The characters are pretty okay. There is a wild variety of characters and the anime constantly adds new ones so that the character cast doesn&#039;t feel stale, but the main ones are pretty weak imo. Ranka can be whiny and Jin waaaay too synical, but both have fun remarks from time to time.  <br />
  <br />
The art okay, the sound is pretty good (the ED is so cute), but the thing that makes me love this anime so much is the charm. This anime is incredibly charming. Along with the fun cast, the anime also features plenty of animal facts. These animal facts then also aply to this anime which creates characters and a lot of good punchlines. The anime also does a bunch of extra little things to make the anime just a little bit special, like how the sloth is present but barely talks or else she loses too much energy, or how we constantly keep up with a lion love story, or when a speech buble appear the characters break the fourth wall and actually interact with the speech bubble, there was so much love put into this anime.<br />
<br />
So yeah, this anime is definition of fun. It does have some flaws here and there (like the annoying main characters), but those can be easily ignored for how charming this anime is.<br />
<br />
If you like highschool comedies, this will be right up your alley.

    Murenase Shiiton Gakuen (Seton Academy) is amazing, amazing in the fact that within a span of 12 episodes, it managed to make me dislike animals.<br />
<br />
On the surface, this show doesn’t raise too many red flags. Besides, we’ve had other anime about the animal society in recent years such as Beastars. The problem about Seton Academy lies in its story execution and character cast. People may see this just another genre cliché milked by school academy tropes. When you combine that with an academy of animals, there’s hardly anything original about the storytelling. And you’d be right. When the audience first meets animal hater, Mazama Jin,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332493">
        he’s nothing more special than an average teenager with a teenage crush on Hino Hitomi, who happens to also be a human. The story tries to adapt and evolve from its initial premise but never chooses an opportunity for development. That’s because his life is now gotten more chaotic than ever after being involved with an animal pack, led by the overenergetic wolf, Ranka.<br />
<br />
I really wish this anime had an auto-mute whenever Ranka opens her mouth. Being a wolf and fiercely protective of her territory, Ranka explifies just about everything I hate about children: loud, annoying, impulsive, and always tries to have her way. Watching her character behavior equates to watching a 5-year old fighting over food with their sibling. Unfortunately for Jin, he has to deal with her behavior on a daily basis. And that doesn’t even count the fact that she is a living object getting in the way of Jin professing his feelings to Hino. Speaking of which, Hino is thrown into the show as a nice type of girl; think of the ‘girl next door type’. It doesn’t take long for Hino to somehow also get entangled into the Ranka’s daily misadventures. To add fuel to the fire, the show somehow manages to throw her into embarrassing situations without batting an eye. The show doesn’t take time to truly develop either character or their relationship. It instead recycles the endless clichés over and over until it milks it dry. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I’m not particularly sure what type of audience this anime is aimed at. With minimal story direction, you’d think this appeals to slice of life fans looking for an extra dose of popcorn entertainment. But no, that’s not where the appeals lies. The show lacks the realism of a human storyteller. It puts overemphasis on the animal society that there’s no time to find life quality. Watching the series feels like the author wanted us to believe in this animal society, taking place in an academy. The animals takes on human roles such as the students and staff. But in reality, these character roles are deconstructed that results in an insufferable character cast. It challenged me to name one character that truly felt worth investing time into and in the end, I came up none. <br />
<br />
Then, there’s the problem with character relationships. Let’s start with the most normal, being the pair of Jin and Hitomi. This is nothing more than a fantasy daydream saturated with character delusions and idiotic fantasies. While many anime of similar genre follows the trend, this show somehow manages to add them without a shred of shame at any chance it gets. The more this show aired, the more these delusions became more like a way of adding extra TV time for each episode. On the animal front, delusions sometimes gets raunchy and suggestive as we have to remember that they behave just like animals. The anime also takes pleasure to show as much as fan service as possible when given the chance, such as with Ranka’s impulsive licking or Miki’s near naked outfits. The character relationship between Jin and Ranka is like compared to a babysitter and a baby. Jin literally has to hold her back sometimes to avoid public problems. Why? That’s because Ranka seems to have the mentality of a kindergartener. Oh and I’m afraid the rest of the cast isn’t any better. For instance, the female koala Shisho has the animal behavior of a sloth and you likely won’t remember a single dialogue in the episodes she’s in. Others such as Komori or Mei Mei fails to capitalize on their own character personalities to be something unique. When I watch either of them interact with others, it reminds me of elementary school, the days where children behave like annoying children. Even some of the more fierce and masculine characters such as the lions aren’t what I pictured them to be. It’s too bad really because this could have been a somewhat entertaining educational exploration of an animal society. But instead, the creators made this look like a horrible meme with unfunny gags and endless amount of idiocy.  <br />
<br />
Somehow, I made it through this anime without smashing my TV screen. This show looked like one written by a zoo fanatic but completely fails to mesmerize the audience with their ideas. With little to no story direction and an absolutely insufferable character cast, it truly deserves the score it gets. Hopefully after reading this review and if someone recommends you to watch Murenase Shiiton Gakuen, you turn your head away and say “no”.

    Murenase! Seton Gakuen is a lighthearted school comedy, but in order to set it apart from the countless others of its genre, it needed a twist. So...the entire academy with the exception of the protagonist and his love interest are animals! Therefore I&#039;m obligated to use awful animal puns. The show is simplistic but actually really howlarious, I&#039;m not lion! It&#039;s a solid easygoing show and I ended up wolfing down each episode&#039;s classy comedy content.<br />
<br />
I had initially thought that this anime would lack depth and that it would slowly trudge on like a sloth, but it&#039;s littered with cute episodic stories that highlight each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332491">
        of the characters. There&#039;s also some deeper meaty substance when it comes to the portrayal of the relationship between the animal hater Jin and the energetic wolf girl Ranka. I was surprised at how much I had fun with each episode and how they would even occasionally bring some depth to some of the characters. The show gets bonus points for actually bringing up some fun facts about animals from time to time. I have no idea if they&#039;re always valid, but I respect shows that can incorporate a bit of educational knowledge into their story without it being a hindrance to the actual narrative. And the way that the anime included some of the more humorous animal characteristics such as female hyenas having...*ahem*...BOTH privates really elevated the anime further. There&#039;s just a lot of koalaty to be found in Seton Academy!<br />
<br />
The cast of characters are a colorful bunch that really breath life into the show. Now there are a lot of them for a single cour anime, and it&#039;s true that most of them fall to the background after getting their own dedicated episode. But don&#039;t worry, this isn&#039;t a cat-tastrophe by any means. This isn&#039;t a narrative driven story but a comedy based one, and I believe that keeping each episode fresh by shining the spotlight on different animals each week kept the show engaging and fun. Whether it was Miyubi&#039;s constant deaths or Meimei&#039;s masochistic tendencies, there was always something enjoyable to watch. This exotic group causes a lot of pandamonium for Jin, who just wants to spend some time with Hitomi, the epidomy of femininity. Of course we can&#039;t forget the ever present wolf girl Ranka, who&#039;s sheer positivity and energetic nature were incredibly endearing. And you gotta love her licking and barking. Despite Jin&#039;s tsundere nature and claims that he doesn&#039;t like her, Ranka almost never loses her upbeat nature, which I appreciate. Though I guess that means she&#039;s not much of an aware wolf. This is a comedy anime first and foremost, and I believe that the success of such a show hinges on the quality of the cast. And while these aren&#039;t the most developed characters or anything, I&#039;m pleased to say that I was thoroughly entertained by their antics. <br />
<br />
Now I know that I&#039;m not a koalafied art critic or anything, but I found  the animation to be the weakest part of the anime. In the beginning, it just looks low budget, which is unfortunate, because the visuals probably turned a lot of people away from the show who probably would have enjoyed the actual content of the anime. But this anime did something incredibly rare, which is improve vissually as it went on. Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I thought that later episodes featured much more detailed art and pretty aesthetics. We get an assortment of cute character designs and many of the characters are pretty expressive. I just feel like the animation lacked consistency. On the flip side, I absolutely loved the voice acting since the beginning. The high pitched animal noises that the seyiuu were making were both hilarious and adorable. Especially Ranka, whose loud, high pitched voice ALMOST ventured into the realm of annoying, but it was just too cute to not like. And the way that she sang the ending theme song, voice cracks and all, was just so howlsome and precious!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll conclude by addressing the elephant in the room, which is do I recommend Murenase! Seton Gakuen? I would say that it&#039;s quite the entertaining anime, and if you just want to watch something fun and don&#039;t mind some weird animal shenanigans, then I&#039;d say go ahead and give this a shot. It&#039;s not purrfect by any means, but if you like a good school life comedy, animals, or a crazy combination of the two, then you should totally watch this anime and join the pack! Thanks for bearing with me to the end!

    It’s an animal trivia-based absurdist comedy. It’s good. If I had to describe it in one word, I’d call it “dumb fun for smart people with refined taste and appreciation for wit.” Here’s what a comedy series should do to be a 10:<br />
<br />
- Out of all the animal-factoids-applied-to-a-humanoid-society shows of the last few years this one is easily the most ingenious in the way, well, in the way the animal trivia is applied to the humanoid societal circumstances and situations (taking into account that the end-goal here is making gags).<br />
<br />
- The comedy is consistently funny, again, because the gags are artfully built on the trivia

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332492">
        foundation. I repeat the same thing multiple times because it really deserves to be emphasized: THIS SHOW IS VERY, VERY CLEVER IN TURNING THE NATURE DOCUMENTARY MATERIAL INTO HUMAN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. On top of that, it does not concern itself in the slightest with the pedantical adhering to reality (have I mentioned the comedy here is “absurdist”? Because the comedy here is absurdist). Instead, it liberally mixes scientific facts and urban legends based on whichever will be funnier in a given moment, and this unfettered approach works wonders. Yet, the show never fails to point out when a piece of trivia it uses is not real, which is also important for keeping it dapper.<br />
<br />
- The characters are likeable and their relationships are “investment-worthy” (believable and interesting to follow). Same deal as in the paragraph above, the characters’ personalities are based on either the real or the folklore traits of their corresponding animal base, and the exact degree of their “animalness” changes arbitrarily based on the necessities of a good joke. While the story’s format and the sheer number of the cast members doesn’t exactly allow for the super complex character arcs, everyone has a clearly defined personality, interacts with the other cast members in a logical way based on how their personalities match, and has some goals and aspirations that steadily progress as the plot progresses.<br />
<br />
- High-effort anime adaptation. The easy place to point this out is the OP/ED. The OP manages to convey every major character’s role in the story in just a few short seconds, while playing thematically fitting jungle music. The ED is simply a work of art. Things like these are your flags - whether you are familiar with the source material or not, they let you know that the anime adaptation’s creative team have put some actual effort and passion into their work. The source material here isn’t mindlessly copy-pasted or mindlessly abridged - things are reshuffled, rewritten and repurposed in order to work better in a different medium that has different strengths and limitations, while preserving the soul of the work. There is more than one case of an episode being stitched together from the parts of five different non-consecutive manga chapters (and I mean “different story arcs” kind of non-consecutive) and it looks completely seamless to a naked eye.<br />
<br />
9.5/10 for a consistently funny, thought-provoking, and high production values comedy series.<br />

    You know what the Ancients always say: &quot;Birds of a feather flock together.&quot; And in the world of the anthropomorphized animal kingdom such as this, whether there&#039;s some form or (valiant) escape or not, this animal academy has it all, nooks and crannies that&#039;s enjoyable to the same degree. This is what this show encapsulates them all into one school comedic package that anyone can pick up and enjoy from start to finish. And for once, both the manga original source and anime are on par with each other.<br />
<br />
The story of humans being in the animal kingdom is relatively unheard of (unless when it comes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332489">
        to prey and predator), but that&#039;s what happened to male MC Jin Mazama. Being someone whose abhorrence with animals has carried his senses from young, an animal school like Seton Academy wouldn&#039;t be his best shot (but decides to make the best anyway by finding human girls like love-interest Hitomi Hino) and make it out alive, all in one piece.<br />
<br />
ALAS, meeting someone coincidentally like Ranka Ookami the wolf just begs his sanity, and you&#039;d know when wolves like to mark people as part of their pack, is when Jin always marks Ranka as the &quot;irritable flea&quot; of the group (despite her calling Jin the &quot;boss&quot;), but doesn&#039;t want her (licking) love shoved in his face. All in all, these animals which arrive by proceeding episodes all shoved into Jin and Hitomi&#039;s cooking club, as stupid and questionable as it sounds, makes for some fun comedy pertaining to each and every animal species&#039; quirks.<br />
<br />
Character-wise, it&#039;s easily a 50-50 combined win for this series. In the cooking club, from adorable Ranka to strong koala Komori and sloth Miyubi (who ALWAYS &quot;Die!&quot; out of comedic laziness) to cat-centric Kurumi, if it&#039;s taking the animal kingdom into the human context, it succeeds somewhat. Remember, ANY and EVERY animal is shown to great detail of how they resemble in real-life, bar none from some differences that are made to characterize (e.g. hyena-girl Yena who acts like a tomboy despite being female). To make the experience turn up a notch, the &quot;scientific&quot; narrations provide a great depth of knowledge based on the highlights of the animals shown and given time to mold their characterization (it was a good time learning from the humans&#039; standpoint as well). And of course, the lion-impala running gag moments of King Shishino and Shiho Ihara (by which if you&#039;ve watched the show, you&#039;d know what I mean). In all sense of the word, if animals are your thing, then this show can satisfy your eyes. The character category is why this show truly excels in its own right.<br />
<br />
With Studio Gokumi helming the production and Cygames being the overall producer, having that &quot;Uma Musume&quot; effect from 2 years ago still rings a lot in my head as far as memories of unique stand-out horse girls go, and this show is no exception. Clearly the Cygames effect just can&#039;t be outclassed when it comes to the specials of standouts from Seton Academy&#039;s footing to all of the character cast (plus the background notables). The same can be said on Studio Gokumi&#039;s side with good artwork and decent animation that overall, I&#039;ll give it a pass for not trying too hard, but having just enough to suffice for the inevitable that the series has offered, much more than actually showcasing the low budgets (which are STILL a sacrificial point, needless to say).<br />
<br />
The musical side though, it was decent overall while the only notable was the OP however. Trying to cram a lot of the key settings and the eccentricity of the characters in a song that&#039;s as unique as idol-centric music was a nice treat to listen to every week, and it did not get old. What got old was Ranka&#039;s ED, but really, a good effort for trying on VA Hina Kino&#039;s part to act on Ranka and her &quot;Ookami Blues&quot; putting a spin on being alternating between cheerfully happy and sad moments.<br />
<br />
All I can say is, it was fun while it lasted. School comedy in the animal kingdom sense is somewhat of a subgenre twist according to the settings here, but while there are hits and misses, generally this is a good show to relax to (while it&#039;s not on the Iyashikei side of things). Not great, but no slouch either.<br />
<br />
Animal lovers of all ages, resound at the beauty of this show, and you&#039;ll never be disappointed. If your answer is a resounding &quot;Yes&quot;, come along to Join the Pack at Seton Academy!

    A generic psuedo-harem ecchi show with an arrogant protagonist who despite being a rude ungrateful ass somehow quickly becomes surrounded by friends. Oh but the girls have animal ears and tails this time, that&#039;s never been done before right?<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a reason why this show only has the male anthropomorphic animals with the females basically human girls badly cosplaying animals, it&#039;s for the cheap sex appeal to compensate for the uninspired writing. <br />
If they actually wanted to focus on just the animal fun facts or the &#039;comedy&#039; and rely on that for a good experience, then there&#039;d be no reason to have the female animals look

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328352">
        like girls in cosplay, but they don&#039;t, they&#039;re relying on the ecchi appeal to pull in the immature demographic for views. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen others comment on this show saying because it&#039;s a comedy it shouldn&#039;t be taken seriously, but in reality they&#039;re just making excuses for how bad the writing is and I bet you they aren&#039;t watching for the jokes. <br />
The comedy isn&#039;t even good either, most of it relies on Jin being a rude asshole to Ranka and most of the other students because he hates animals for some reason, despite living in a world where you can communicate with all of them!? Or cheap ecchi jokes, like the school president being a naked mole-rat girl who&#039;s embarrassed to wear clothes. Such an amazing pun that was clearly written for the laughs and totally not as an excuse for her strip constantly! Oh and she doesn&#039;t actually get naked either, she keeps her underwear on even in private with her other naked mole-rats, showing it&#039;s not about her species but instead for more cheap sex appeal and ratings. <br />
<br />
If ecchi and generic slice-of-life are your thing, then by all means watch this show. But if you&#039;re over puberty and looking for a show that does something new or has some substance to its writing/humour, stay far away from this garbage heap.

    Hmm, more semi-furry anime.<br />
<br />
Alright lads, this anime is very weird but at the same time quite good. The character designs are interesting. The females have the ears and a tail while the males are just anthropomorphic animals. The comedy is fairly funny, but as we all know that comedy is relative so some may not like this. The Opening and Ending are both great. Opening is catchy with cool visuals. Ending is more sad lyrically, but the music is still good and is sung by Rankas voice actress. <br />
<br />
Story: So, we follow Jin Mazama who is one of the two humans in a school filled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329031">
        with animal human hybrids, but the thing is he hates animals for the reason that a group of bears once bullied him. He accidentally hits Ranka with a pineapple of all thing during the welcoming speech. He later goes to the cafeteria and meets Ranka yet again but this time Ranka invites him to her pack. Of course he refuses but later on after another human Hitomi Hino joins Rankas pack and then Jin also joins. Hitomi creates a Cooking Club and all of them join in and also few other people Yukari Komori who is a koala and Miyubi Shishio who is a sloth. We follow them and their daily whacky adventures while meeting new people. We also got a tournament episode or as they call it &quot;a field day&quot; where every species can flex on other with their natural powers. <br />
<br />
This is a very funny and light-hearted comedy anime with of course many character who are waifu material. I personally would recommend this to everyone.

Murenase! Seton Gakuen (2020)<br />
<br />
Join the pack. Yes, please. <br />
<br />
For me I found this show a triumph. It contains many things that I love and therefore is one of my favourite shows. It does deviate from its source material but then many adaptations do. You can only adapt so much in a tough industry.  <br />
<br />
When I first noticed this show on the site before it aired I began to read the manga of which is ongoing. I am very pleased with how the show runs in this hilarious slice of life comedy in a school. <br />
<br />
I was immediately in the show itself happy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332549">
        see the dinosaur teachers they are just amazing. <br />
<br />
It is odd in some ways that the males are the animal and girls are demi-human but personally I have no complaints. This is especially hilarious with King Shishino and Shiho Ihara in their situation. <br />
<br />
A big shoutout for all the lionesses who are adorable. <br />
<br />
The story itself just revolves around Jin who has been emotionally damaged when younger by animals so acts to dislike them but in reality, he is a harshly worded tsundere. Ranka is his partner to his own dismay in some cases but also not in others. She is a cute wolf. <br />
<br />
The art of the show I personally think for the show itself is great. It does exactly what it needs to do consistently throughout the show. <br />
<br />
The OP for this show is great, it is so memorable and great to listen too. The ED is more calm and different but is still great. Voices are superb in Japanese. Ranka has an amazing voice and hats off to the VA because she is such an adorable character. <br />
<br />
In terms of character, there are a fair few but the main characters revolve around the cooking club and the side story of King Shishino and Shiho Ihara.<br />
<br />
Cooking Club:<br />
<br />
- Jin the main as said is a harshly worded tsundere. He does care for Ranka more than he shows but does slip up at times. <br />
- Ranka is a super cute pink-haired wolf girl with a noticeably unusual voice that is adorable. <br />
- Hitomi exists as like Jin another human who is therefore in Jin&#039;s interest by species.<br />
- Yukari is a green-haired koala that has questionable eating habits. <br />
- Miyubi is a blonde sloth. She suffers often a fate expected of a sloth. <br />
- Kurumi Nekomai is a pink-haired cat. She is the best character for me since I love catgirls. She is a tsundere but her tail gives her away. <br />
- Meimei is a panda who is a complete masochist and loves the attention she gets from Jin which is in contrast to her pampered lifestyle. <br />
<br />
The Couple:<br />
<br />
- King Shishino a male lion as expected in beast form. He is pretty funny and makes for a hilarious side story. <br />
- Shiho Ihara an impala is a cute demi-human girl that makes again for the funny scenario.<br />
<br />
Others of note: <br />
<br />
- Kuroe Mashima a zebra demi-human that builds the first few episodes. <br />
- The rabbits are pretty involved and pretty funny in the aspect they contribute. <br />
- The lionesses are also pretty great and fit the gal style well for those it applies. <br />
- Kurumi&#039;s cat friends are all amazing because cats. <br />
- Yena a female hyena with identity issues. <br />
- An a neanderthal who makes for the final part. <br />
- Man the mammoth who is a loli female effectively. <br />
<br />
Special mention for her cameo appearance is Suimori Chii a common vampire bat that in the manga is super cute and on par with Kurumi for best girl. Seen during the festival. <br />
<br />
There are many other characters to see and know in the show and the quantity in the detail it is shown is what makes the show great. <br />
<br />
With this, it helps the enjoyment with the facts that Jin comes out with all being true and the narrator facts being true too. It is great that many of them act how they should do as the animal but in a more civilised way. One example of this is how the female rabbit&#039;s act is true to their nature. <br />
<br />
The show covers a fair amount of the source material but also leaves plenty of room for another season. <br />
<br />
The show has a great dynamic with how it flows through and the enjoyment it brings. I looked forward to the OP every week. I looked forward to Ranka and Kurumi and what shenanigans will be had this week. <br />
<br />
In the end, for me, this is an excellent show that ticks many boxes to a very high standard. There is a special coming too towards summer 2020 and hopefully, it can be continued in the anime with a season 2 followed afterwards. <br />
<br />
The source material continues forwards and is definitely worth reading too.

    As this anime ends , I&#039;d probably say that this was just one of those harem themed anime where there weren&#039;t any competition for the guy&#039;s affection, and quite frankly there isn&#039;t a lot of them animes like this where it&#039;s the girl who has to try hard to wind over the guy&#039;s affection, also this probably the only anime where we see a female character taking the lead when it comes to being the &quot;BOSS&quot; of the group, so:<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Pros: Ok, so the plot ride on that usual harem genre, but unlike the usual, the plot itself wasn&#039;t more like guy like certain girl but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332531">
        another girl keeps the guy from ever having a serious relationship with the girl that the guy like, also this has that certain situation, where it wasn&#039;t the harem that was being portrayed around here but rather the relationships of the members of the &quot;Cooking Cub&quot; as they go day by day of being able to proved that different species can get along......<br />
<br />
Con: given that this was the usual harem themed anime, it still relies on the short romances that the club members have for the guy.....<br />
<br />
Verdict (6/10)<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Pros: It may have that usual ecchi element but it was mostly limited to Miki Hadano, though the most intense one would be with Mashima Krone in the beginning and Hino Hitomi at the end. <br />
<br />
Cons: Thought there was an onsen service and beach service don&#039;t expect any boob flash from Hitomi nor with anybody else.<br />
<br />
Verdict (6/10)<br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
Pros: Well, I can say for sure that studio Studio Gokumi did choose the right seiyuu to do the voices of the characters most especially when they choose Kino Hina to do Ranka&#039;s voice and there that opening theme &quot; &quot;Gakuen Soukan Zoo &quot; by Ryouri-bu and ending theme &quot;Ookami Blues by Kino Hina.<br />
<br />
Cons: It was kind of a waste that the seiyuu who did Shishio, Miyubi&#039;s voice <br />
Kohara, Konomi was basically a waste of the seiyuu&#039;s talent, also the who did the Mammoth Girl&#039;s voice sounded pretty much like a reatard.<br />
<br />
Verdict (7/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Pros: Well, I did say that having an MC like Jin who wasn&#039;t much of a nice guy, in fact he&#039;s one guy you&#039;ll like to hate, but here he&#039;s an exception , cu&#039;z he really did played his tsundere role very well, now I don&#039;t know about you but TBH, I really do find Ranka being this yauidere dere dere to Jin as rather annoying and if this anime&#039;s manga series I would prefer that he ends up with Hitomi, if not IMAO it would better that it gets a harem ending. <br />
<br />
Cons: Thought Ranka does provide the comedic aspect of this seires ( Anime and Manga) she was pretty much an annoyance that I would have prefer that Jin just simply ignores her when Kronoe was having fun with her, also I kinda hate that Hitomi becomes this yuri magnet for Yena and Ann, now if Ann was looking forward to make them mordern humans to go extinct, then she doesn&#039;t have to put up a sweat given that Jin might end up with Ranka and Hitomi might end up having a yri relationship with her and Yena.<br />
<br />
Verdict (8/10)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Pros: It wasn&#039;t a chore watching it.<br />
<br />
Cons: Nothing to mentioned.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Verdict (8/10)<br />
<br />
Even thought, this maybe the usual harem anime, it was just worthwhile watching it, but for this to have a season 2, well IMAO that just pushing it.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    Seton Academy: Join the Pack! Review<br />
SPOILER FREE<br />
<br />
<br />
Intro<br />
After witnessing a fair amount of drama surrounding this show from the furry community leaking into the anime community, I decided to give this show a shot. Fueled by an urge to support a series that was falsely slandered online, I finished Seton Academy; and overall, it wasn’t that bad!<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story of Seton Academy is very limited compared to other anime, while not falling to far behind from others of its genre. It follows a human named Jin enrolling at a school called Seton Academy filled with animals, all of which he hates with a passion for mostly unexplained

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332527">
        reasons. After he meets a human girl named Hitomi, he feels as though his experience at the academy will finally be turned around. When he finds that Hitomi is rather sympathetic to the other species of the academy, he inadvertently becomes part of a multi species harem under the guise of a cooking club. The story is obviously not a very important part of the show, because it is mostly ignored in favour of bolstering the other departments of the show which make it worth watching. Be honest, if you are watching Seton for the plot, then you need a better hobby.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art of SA is wholly unremarkable but is rather important to discuss at least for a bit. The main reason I decided to watch SE is because of the drama that it garnered during its pilot, when it is revealed that the main premise of the show is a mix of real animals and kemonomimi. There was no mention of SE’s art direction before its anime adaptation, but after certain furries found this show, there was quite a bit of uproar about just that. I’m very impartial to kemonomimi, and anthropomorphic styles both, but the needless conflict about it bugged me quite a bit. If a viewer wants anthropomorphic style, there is more than enough content surrounding it online, even Beastars caters directly to that crowd in the anime space. Let the people that want to watch a show for kemonomimi do that in peace, this show clearly wasn’t made to be accurate in that category… it’s a harem SoL. Nobody complains about Cells at Work cells being humans and not round unicellular blobs, because that’s the appeal. Rant aside, the art does more than enough to convey themes and characters but doesn’t overachieve in that sense.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
There isn’t much to be said about the sound design of SE. Like the story, that simply isn’t a big focus. So even though it gets a lower individual rating, it won’t matter as much as the others do towards the overall score. There are no bangers to be found here, but the ED is enjoyable, and sound effects realistic which can be said add to the overall comedy of the show.<br />
6/10<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The characters of this show are very good. For the genre, they each have surprising depth even if it’s not exactly how more sophisticated shows might portray depth. Each character doesn’t vary far from the quirks that each animal they’re based of off might have, but each animal’s shortcomings irl are real shortcomings that the characters experience and can overcome. Each character, like other harems, have two-dimensional identities, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because it helps the main three characters: Ranka, Jin, and Hitomi become more developed. Those three, by the way, are all very likable and help with this show’s enjoyment. I won’t give specific characters, because the joy of this show is slowly getting introduced to all the characters and their quirks.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
If there is one aspect this anime excels at, it is enjoyment. Seeing the progression of characters being added and seeing how real-life aspects of their animals affect them is always a treat and did not get old even up to the loli mammoth they added because mammoths were smaller than people think. Small things like that add up to give this show a unique dumb enjoyment not often found. Many shows worry too much about being the next masterpiece like death note, or the next needlessly ecchi show like Ishuzoku Reviewers. This show knows its place very well in the anime community, and caters extremely niche, yet very broad at the same time. If you can get past the entry barrier of the female and male animal split there awaits a very enjoyable anime to take your mind off the scary events ongoing in real life.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
SE is hyper focused in certain aspects to maximize the strong suits of its genre. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing to some watchers, but it could be off putting to others. Thus, it finds itself in a limbo of not being dumb fun, but also not very serious either, if that interests you then I highly suggest Seton Academy.<br />

    Ok, as I have seen in previous reviews, a lot of people do like this show, so here <br />
am I to tell you my opinion.<br />
I do not really like shows where there are actual animals, demi-humans are good enough, you should not cross the border.<br />
Of course there is Ranko which is pretty cute, cannot name other characters cuz of spoilers.<br />
I never thought I would ever find OP that irritating(its no better with ending).<br />
But I gotta admit, i learnt something from this show, so Imma give it 5 stars.<br />
If you are into animals, this anime could satisfy your needs.

    Kemono Friends: School Life Edition<br />
<br />
Welcome to Seton Gakuen, where the teachers are literally dinosaurs and the students are anthropomorphized animal-human hybrids!<br />
<br />
Jin Mazama voiced by Haruki Ishiya hates animals but accidentally enrolled to Seton academy however he becomes smitten with Hitomi Hino voiced by Yume Miyamoto HOWEVER Ranka Ookami voiced by Hina Kino a wolf wants Jin to be in her &quot;pack&quot; as she wants to have a colorful cast of different species to be in her pack. Hitomi on the other hand creates the cooking club where Jin joins to spend more time with her however Ranka and the latter on, Yukari Komori voiced by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332536">
        Misaki Kuno a koala who wants to eat tasty new food, Miyubi Shishi voiced by Konomi a sloth that &quot;dies&quot; from &quot;overwork&quot;, Kurumi Nekomai voiced by Sora Tokui a cat joins the cooking club and comedy hijinks ensues.  Due to Ranka&#039;s overactive and helpful nature is how she bring sin all these animals into the cooking club and because of this the club goes beyond six members thanks to this.<br />
<br />
The comedy if anything from Murenase Seton Gakuen revolves around the animals and how they&#039;re &quot;nature&quot; translate into the hijinks into the anime and that Jin and Ranka and the cooking club needs to fix, be it if it&#039;s a lion who falls in love with impala to a    <br />
sports festival...with animals in where Miyubi wants to TAKE PART IN IT!??!?!. This does take the comedy to crazy levels merely due to the premise itself and majority of the time it lands as it&#039;s both realistic due to how informative it is about the animal in question of the episode to the character interactions with those animals in question that makes the comedy rather funny AND informative.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are pretty well done for a comedy anime as yes they do have some running gags about them like Ranka and her clinginess to Jin and JIn wanting to find ways for him to be alone time with Hitomi and backfiring to Miyubi&#039;s deaths and whatnot but as the anime progresses and the new character verge to the cooing club ALOT of great interactions happens and best part is that the anime&#039;s structure doesn&#039;t reset itself, thus as more characters comes into play, they sometimes have a cascading effect towards the cooking club one way or another. Of course there are some isolated episodes like their look at the Sea division of the Seton Gakuen but for the most part, due to how the anime&#039;s cast grows, the character interactions and thus little developments with the huge cast grows at that too.<br />
<br />
Ok now for the elephant in the room...or more like human in the room this time, Jin as a character will probably be the most divisive character in the anime due to how hostile and annoyed he is to ALMOST every character in the anime besides Hitomi and wants nothing to do with him. On one hand he does help with the what Ranka wants to help with, bu on the other hand in more comedic moments he wants nothing to do with Ranka, so take JIn like you will, even LA can&#039;t pin Jin down...he can be a good one liner due to how informative he is about animals as much as he hates animals, but on the other when he&#039;s extremely hostile to Ranka and even the animals outside the cooking club, he can be VERY aggressive. In a ways it&#039;s like Noah from Noah&#039;s Ark being pissed off that he&#039;s stuck with animals for the rest of his life with NO human interaction.<br />
<br />
The animation done by Studio Gokumi was pretty consistent and detailed all things withstanding thanks to how good the character designs were as well as all the crazy reactions from ALL the characters were as well as the decent backgrounds etc. From the character designs themselves, the female characters have the typical anime anthropomorphized form to them (well cept Hitomi cos she&#039;s you know HUMAN) while the male characters have more animal features to them. From this Studio Gokumi overall did a great job in the animation while LA will also praise the manga author Bungo Yamashita for creating the world of Murenase! Seton Gakuen whereas it&#039;s an amalgamation of what if? of humanized/antromorphized animals co-existing with humans.<br />
<br />
The voice cast is actually pretty great in all honesty from Yukari Tamura as the student council president Miki Hadano, Tomokazu Sugita as King Shishino the big lion on campus, Sora Tokui as Kurumi Nekomai, Misaki Kuno as Yukari Komori, Konomi Kohara as Miyubi Shisho, Yuu Serizawa as Mei Mei, Yume Miyamoto as Hitomi Hino and finally Hino Kino as Ranka Ookami. Probably the MVP is easily Hina Kino as the hyperactive genki wolf Ranka but LA would also like to give it to Misaki Kuno as Yukari because of that one koala scream she did because WOW...it&#039;s like Hawkform Seven Deadly Sins x 100 screaming cadence, LA was actually quite impressed nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Murenase! Seton Gakuen does go into an sorta finale arc once Anne Anetani voiced by Sumire Uesaka arrives where she struggles in having a crush on Hitomi while trying to &quot;achieve her goal&quot; and the WHOLE club is affected during the cultural festival. Nonetheless this breaks form the isolated &quot;animal&quot; episode. Either way, typical finale arc with a change in tone, which LA didn&#039;t mind.<br />
<br />
Murenase Seton Gakuen is both an informative school comedy about the animals and their interactions with other animals AND the humans that are in school with them. If anything it&#039;s not Hitomi and Jin in school with dinosaurs and animals, it&#039;s Hitomi and Jin being the zookeepers and finding ways to fix problems with the academy zoo with a wolf, sloth, cat, koala and panda all helping and this kinda premise though LA wasn&#039;t interested at first, as soon as LA watched it, LA was hooked and LA had fun with this anime ALL the way through.<br />
<br />
So why not &quot;join the pack?&quot;

    Seton Academy is one of those shows you look at and think &quot;Wow, this looks really dumb.&quot; but you would be wrong. <br />
<br />
~~~May Contain Spoilers~~~<br />
<br />
This show has a purpose. That purpose is supposed to teach you that no matter where you come from or what you look like you should make friends with everyone! Overall the show is very light-hearted with very mild &quot;uncomfortable&quot; scenes. Almost every episode tries to put a point across, mostly friendship related. such as getting along with this person, setting aside differences, and just dong judge someone by looking at them.<br />
<br />
All around I enjoyed this show a lot. If you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332523">
        are one of those people that don&#039;t really understand furries or animal people this show might not be for you. BUT... Half the people look humanish so its not really that bad. Overall I would watch the first episode and if you don&#039;t like the way they look or act you should probably stop because it doesn&#039;t change much.

    The show is funny but not sure who are the right people for this kind of show, it lacked the progression between the 2 human main characters. Art and sound are fine with the exception of Ranka&#039;s annoying voice. Totally zero character development which is a letdown. <br />
<br />
I have to admit that the only reason why I watched this is because of the Dino school staff, I particularly liked Terano sensei and was hoping that they would give the Dino teachers more screen time but they didn&#039;t which is quite disappointing<br />
<br />
I would have preferred if they focused a little more on the character relationship development

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333460">
        and it lacked a proper story but overall I did enjoy the comedic part of the show.<br />
<br />

    Murenase! Seton Gakuen is an anime about a couple of humans or rather the human male Jin experiences on an school for animals.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything too special but good enough to enjoy it as every character and their way of acting is explained with their real life counterpart.<br />
<br />
The art is colorful and someone may think that it&#039;s aimed to children but it has quite the amount of fanservice.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, Jin isn&#039;t a bad character but sometimes it&#039;s hard to sympathize with him as he tends to be too hard on some of his classmates, yet still redeems himself everytime by helping them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332764">
        at the end of the episode. I wouldn&#039;t call it a case of tsundererism but sometimes he doesn&#039;t make too much sense.<br />
<br />
Overall is a serie easy to watch and one of these you must watch this season.<br />
<br />

    Murenase! Seto Gakuen, was a good show. A fun watch with fun character. I love the animal character they have here. Various cute animal out of nowhere and join the cooking club. Lucky Jin, with how hate Jin to the animal, he always get into the problem to the all cute animal girls. My best scene was in MeiMei episode. How cute their relations. Sadly, it wont long last. Yet, with the focus of the genre do not come to any relationship, i can&#039;t do anything to help. Maybe a bit too over reacted at some scene. And i dislike so much about Hyena persona.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332634">
        But its okay afterall. Since they just prove, that they have a good character with cute and fun persona as a unison Lol. Dont get me wrong.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is my shortes review, because this anime can not watch continously at one day. But, its okay. This show actually pretty fun and give a prospecting promising one of this year series. How detailed narrator give information can not missed my judgement here. It was so amazing. How they put it with best momment, the interaction was so smooth. Sometimes, maybe a bit too rushed. The side story also a good approach to show some more unique dedications. But, my complaint just one. The ending. Its awful, non sense, can not bring my enjoyment at other previous episodes. Damn, with that problem, and other unnoticeable-with-no-explanation reason, i just wanna put my rating to the story section at 7. An average story with an awful ending. Really apreciate if the studio give their best video to improve my complain. Can they?<br />
<br />
For other aspect like music, sounds, art, characteristic were good. Maybe not be the best. But not bad at all. I smirk with the animal sound, and mixing it with female acting realy make laugh. 8/10 for them, which is include to the art one. Enjoyment shall be the integration to all aspect. Same as the overall section. By clearing my intentions there, i will give my enjoyment for some conditions. First, story telling quiet well enough explanations, and it plot was good. The aspect to this some was average, 5 point. With that plus my reason aboves, the total shall be 6 points. Second, character development was nice, or unique, and strong enough to surpass the plot advancement to the story sake. With that i may come my score to the 8, since i like how Jin&#039;s character so well change every episode. His interaction over other female animals was good. Even, his characteristic is horrible, but that just make this anime likeable by me. With that, i give 8 to compare all of the problem, and give total character point to 8 aswell. 8 plus 6 is 7. So that is my enjoyment and overall points for this show. Not bad nor best at my common sense of decision.

    This show is just plain lovable adorkable hilarity. You have a human guy Jin who hates animals who ends up going to an animal school where all the guys are full anthro and the girls are human like with animal ears and tails. Then comes the absolutely adorable pink wolf Ranka and ridiculous hilariousness comes afterwords.<br />
<br />
The big thing that draws you in with this is just how much nuttiness comes out of this, and how much you can laugh at how everyone works off each other. While the characters are simple, you still feel for them and watching how they bounce off one another and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328351">
        their odd animal traits, like constantly dying sloths, naked mole rats who get embarrassed by wearing clothes, and a lion in love with a impala (a kind of gazelle) just makes you connect with them in some odd ways you wouldn&#039;t normally think of. <br />
<br />
The artwork and music is good, but nothing to write home about. The voice work though is quite fun and it&#039;s hard not to feel the effort the VA&#039;s are putting into this.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing this show is missing is a main story, but it&#039;s not really the kind of show  that wanted to have an all encompassing story to begin with, so it&#039;s more slice of life nature is sufficient to what it claimed to be giving out. <br />
<br />
One thing i wasn&#039;t expecting to get going in is the educational aspect this show has. While none of the info is really all that useful, it&#039;s fun stuff you could be like &quot; hey here&#039;s a odd little fact to either interest or horrify you&quot; with someone.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is quite a fun show, with a lot of odd ball hilarity and some odd ball connections between the character that might hit you somewhere you were not expecting.

    Give this show a shot if you enjoy fun humor and interesting banter. I love this show!<br />
<br />
The story is not in-depth or complex like you would expect from something like Death Note. It&#039;s light-hearted and fun but you still look forward to what happens next episode! <br />
<br />
I have no issues with the art. Personally I think it fit perfectly with the style and tone of the show!<br />
<br />
Characters were loveable. You&#039;ll understand what I mean from the first episode.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. What stood out for me was the humor and concept. Well executed in my opinion.
