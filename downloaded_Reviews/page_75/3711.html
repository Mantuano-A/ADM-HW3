    My first review ever, couldn&#039;t have chosen a better anime. several rewatches later and I finally decided to write reviews for every precure season. <br />
I will start by saying this is the best anime original and magical girl series to have ever been created, this is not up for debate, simply facts.<br />
The OG precure season and my introduction into the precure series as I&#039;m sure it was the same for alot of other precure fans. This season has one of my favorites ED&#039;s and the OP is a classic, the story is simply amazing, the music as well was amazing, the art is just what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review408054">
        you&#039;d expect from an anime made in 2004. Overall a masterpiece among masterpieces. Nagisa and Honoka will forever be icons in the magical girl world.<br />
<br />
<br />
also small side note: this is a great starting point for beginners and it is where I started, though you can&#039;t go wrong starting with any other season, coming from a precure veteran having rewatched the entire series multiple times I&#039;d say starting with &quot;futari wa precure&quot; is the best way to start the series and from there going in order of release.

    We&#039;ve reached the end of magical girl month, so let&#039;s dive back into the Precure franchise. It wasn&#039;t that long ago that I looked at Doki Doki Precure, one of the more recent installments in the franchise. This time let&#039;s go far, far back to 2004 when Toei animation first started the franchise with Futari wa Precure. Was the series as good back then or is this one of those franchises that got a rough start? Let&#039;s take a look and find out.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Young Misumi Nagisa is in her room when she notices falling stars. One of them crashes into her room, hits her in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179123">
        head and turns out to be a strange creature that had turned into a cell phone like device. He calls himself Mepple and asks Nagisa to take him to Mipple. She goes out, following his directions only to run into a classmate she barely knows, Yukishiro Honoka. The two are attacked by a strange villain called Jean Luc Pisard, who looks like he belongs in a Kabuki theatre. To fight him, they hold hands, go through rainbows and transform into Precure. After fending him off they find out that Mepple and Mipple are denizens of the Garden of Light, which was invaded by the Dark King. In order to save it they have to defeat his minions and get the seven Prism Stones, two of which they already have.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s open, as usual, with the narrative problems. The first is that the story arc is kind of bizarre. It&#039;s like the writers thought that the series was only getting twenty six episodes only to find out that it was going to be nearly twice as long when they&#039;d already set everything up for the finale and they had to backtrack to rekindle the conflict. I&#039;m glad that the series has the extra twenty three episodes because a lot of them are really good, but they still involve a lot of re-treading, at least in terms of the conflict. Another issue is that the characters who are supposed to be aiding them are frequently pretty useless. Take Wisdom as an example. He&#039;s so useless that the one time he actually does anything he has to be told to act by Pollun of all people. Bloody Pollun.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m going to talk about the gratuitous romance separately since I wouldn&#039;t call it bad, but I also wouldn&#039;t call it a good element since it is pretty pointless. However, it is kind of interesting in its execution. What do I mean by that? Well, it has to be the most passive aggressive inclusion of a gratuitous male love interest ever. It&#039;s like the writers were told that they had to include a male love interest but they didn&#039;t want to so they gave the guy a boyfriend who would always be by his side and engage in typical romance story tropes with him. Like one running happily to the other and apologising for making him wait. They sometimes bring up Nagisa&#039;s crush on him and then use it as an excuse to develop her relationship with Honoka while avoiding doing anything between her and him. It&#039;s like they&#039;re actively sabotaging it with the combined power of yaoi and yuri. To be fair to the writers, if I was writing something for a studio and they insisted on it having het I&#039;d do pretty much the same thing and it does lead to some funny moments.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a lot about the series that&#039;s praiseworthy. Futari Wa has a lot of really fun and funny moments, including an episode that focuses on Honoka&#039;s dog taking care of a puppy. More magical girl series need episodes about dogs. But it&#039;s not all fun. There&#039;s some emotional depth to the series. It manages some really good tragic moments. Sure, they&#039;re used sparingly, but they&#039;re still there and they really work. There are some good tense moments too. The series is also good at building up major plot points and giving them a strong payoff.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Nagisa and Honoka are really strong leads and they have an excellent dynamic. Their families and friends are well fleshed out, with pretty much all of them having verisimilitude. There are also some strong interactions with them and their family and friends that really help flesh out their characters. I even like Fujimura and his boyfriend, and it&#039;s rare to find a likeable character who is technically there as a gratuitous love interest.<br />
<br />
The villains are the big weakness. They&#039;re largely pretty one-note characters without much personality. To be fair, there is a reason for their actions that makes sense, but they still aren&#039;t developed or interesting in the least. There is one major exception with a sympathetic villain who gets complexity, but I won&#039;t spoil who it is. I also kind of like the two butler Zakenna. They aren&#039;t developed but they are pretty hilarious. The Garden of Light denizens are another weakness. Most of them are just bland. The exception being Pollun. If he&#039;s not as annoying as Ai was in DokiDoki, he comes really close. He&#039;s bratty, obnoxious, frequently throws tantrums where he repeats the same phrase in the most grating manner possible and just causes problems for everyone. Especially the audience.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art and animation are largely really good. Futari wa has good designs, except for the second set of villains who just look boring. It also has really good physical action sequence and detailed backgrounds. The monsters are nice and creative and I do like the little black stars who start apologising when they lose. They&#039;re simple but well done. It does suffer a bit from repetitive stock footage. Especially in terms of special attacks. Nagisa and Honoka have two major attacks they use in the series and the animation used for them setting up even looks pretty similar. The big difference between them is what kind of beam gets fired. They get downright lazy with the Queen of Light too. Her design is pretty cool, but she doesn&#039;t really move or change expressions.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Honna Youko and Yukana both deliver strong performances as Nagisa and Honoka. Really, most of the cast does really well in their roles. Sendai Eri and Kiuchi Reiko both do really well too and Ono Kenichi makes for a pretty intimidating villain. The big issue is Ikezawa Haruna. She&#039;s not a bad actor, but she does voice a character who constantly whines, yells and is generally just painful to listen to. Honestly though, I don&#039;t think anyone could have done better with a character like Pollun since his main purpose as a character is to be an annoyance. The music is stellar and there are several cases where they incorporate lyrical works into episodes to great effect. The choir episode in particular.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
I touched on this a bit when talking about the romance, so I&#039;ll refrain from repeating too much of that. For ho-yay we&#039;ve got Fujimura and his boyfriend. There&#039;s a bit of les-yay between Shiho and Rina. The main source of les-yay comes from our leads, Honoka and Nagisa. Even ignoring the rainbows and hand holding, though they hold hands about a hundred and thirty three times, there is a lot of homo-eroticism between them. For every awkward scene that goes nowhere with Fujimura, Nagisa gets ten really adorable scenes with Honoka. These two talk about how close they&#039;ve gotten and share a bed while holding hands. They also play Romeo and Juliet and Nagisa forgets her lines and speaks purely from the heart in an amazing scene. Even with the gratuitous male love interest, the series earns a 6/10 for ho-yay.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Futari wa Precure is a really strong series. It has a nice level of emotional depth, it&#039;s fun, hilarious. a lot of the characters are well developed, the action is great and the acting is strong. Still, it does suffer from some story issues, Pollun, bland villains, Pollun, over-used stock footage, Pollun and some laziness. My final rating is an 8/10. I do suggest checking it out if you&#039;re a fan of magical girl works or if you like super subtexty les-yay. So, that&#039;s it for magical girl month. Next week we&#039;ll open February with Natsu no Arashi.

    I am a big fan of magical girl genre, especially older-style. I kept seeing Pretty Cure for ages and I finally gave it a try. It was a pleasant surprise. The story is in continuation despite being randomish at times, the girls level up in character and they don&#039;t magically know what to do from the get go. Very good and fun.<br />
<br />
The story is enjoyable. Nothing too special, but interesting regardless.<br />
<br />
I truly love the art so it gets a 10 from me as does the sound. I rarily do not skip openings and this one I *never* skipped. <br />
<br />
Characters are amazing. I don&#039;t know do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303023">
        I prefer Nagisa or Honoka.<br />
<br />
In general, I truly like this show and anyone who likes the genre will have fun. It&#039;s not hard on the brain, but well done. I usually review only things I really like so, obviously, a 10 - or rather 9.5 from me.

    Let me say, if you like heroines, watch it!<br />
I liked this anime because it was one like I have never seen. I&#039;ve watched Sailor moon and Powerpuff girls z(and afterwords I started watching Sailor Moon Crystal), but this one stuck out to me.<br />
I honestly don&#039;t know why exactly, but maybe because they&#039;re basically powerless without each other. They can&#039;t even transform by themselves. In Sailor moon, usually not all the sailors are present. In powerpuff girls z, They can kind of survive by themselves, but are still stronger together.<br />
Perhaps it&#039;s because there&#039;s only two people. In the other animes, there were more people.<br />
Perhaps it&#039;s because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165237">
        their powers are more associative with each other thus making a better team. If you notice in the other animes, they work side by side, but don&#039;t seem very connected. <br />
P.S. I tried making this without spoilers, I&#039;m sorry if I did.

    NOTE: let me just say that i watched the Dub on YTV first,then i started with the subbed version since i was tired of waiting for the new episodes on YTV.<br />
<br />
Ok.Pretty cure.How did i start watching it? Oh thats right.Because of the lack of anime on Bionix,YTV put pretty cure on.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is your typical Magical Girl anime. Save the world with frilly outfits,abnormal powers,and beat up bad guys. But there is one aspect of pretty cure that sets itself apart from every other magical girl anime out there. The fighting. the fighting is much more shonen (like punches,kicks,throws) yes there is a huge amount

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23753">
        of rainbows and light and sparkles,but Cure Black and Cure White can only use it when their together,unlike anime like Sailor moon,when each girl can use their power wherever,whenever. Also,another huge aspect in pretty cure is the fact that no boys come to the aid of the superheronies,nor do they really need it. In most magical girl anime, there is a boy doing the whole puch-out! aspect,while the girls use a magical spell or wand type thing to help out the guy. Pretty Cure do it all on there own.they destroyed a huge minion of the dark side by using a really cool attack called &quot;pretty cure marble screw!&quot; No boys allowed to interfere. the Art is so-so,but none the less pretty.The sound is average(in the sub) but if you seriously want to try this out,DO NOT WATCH THE DUB.IT SUCKS!! The voices and script are totally mixed up,and the opening is trash.just don&#039;t.please.the characters are also quite average,but Nagisa and Honoka cannot be one without the other.<br />
<br />
Overall I very much enjoyed this anime,untill the second half,when the whole Pretty Cure thing got boring and i dropped watchnig it. If your looking for a fresh,new twist on magical girl genre,watch pretty cure,or even shugo chara!

    I am on episode 26 and thus far it is a fine show. the story is your typical mahou shoujo setup with the all the standard fare. i would attribute the story&#039;s downfall to the fact that the target audience for this show is probably that of a much younger age group.<br />
<br />
my issue with the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; would be that there is never a time when you can emotional invest yourself in the lives of these magical girls, and that is a real shame because Honoka and Nagisa, as character types, have great potential. i wish i could say the same for their furry friends... at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9040">
        times i wish that they would dispose of their cell phoned sidekicks-mepo!<br />
<br />
the girls transform together, they call on their powers through an elaborate creature-infused cell phone &amp;amp; card system. with one swipe, journey through an epic transformation with music to match. the way they fall into place right before they let you know who they are and what they plan to do with you, is thee sweetest part of the transformation for me. <br />
<br />
the battles happen according to a formula that you pretty much get by first couple of episodes and it DOES get stale.  i wish their attacks had been upgraded by now  or they would get new ones. <br />
<br />
what i would like to see are more episodes that deal with the girls&#039; daily lives with no episodic battles... they have 49 episodes i am sure they can find a way to spare a few.

    This is the original Pretty Cure serie and is a good season to start Precure. Is weird how can some Precure fans judge this show  because this story is great and it shows what Precure is about. <br />
Friendship is the most important thing and the characters portray this very well. The characters´s development is great  and there are very emotional and deep episodes. Misumi Nagisa and Yukishiro Honoka are like ying and yang.Nagisa and Honoka didn´t start close from the beginning and had to overcome many obstacles to become  the best friends.  They complement each other no matter how different they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195926">
        are. Nagisa is a girl who loves sports and has a tomboyish personality menawhile Honoka is a very smart girl who is very calm.  But both have other sides of their personalities, Nagisa can be very  girly and romantic  when she thinks about her love while Honoka is very strong when she has to speak her mind. They are the Pretty Cure team  who use their own physical powers more than magic powers which make them  a very unique  team in magic girls series. <br />
Not only these two are interesting, but other characters are as interesting as them, specially a boy named  Kiriya.  Futari wa Pretty Cure is a very heartwarming anime that  can give hope  to the audience. I  really recommend this season. Hopefully Precure fans who never watched this will give it a chance.

    (as written on the Hateful Anime Truth on Facebook)<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t judge me on this line alone; I love some obscure anime. And thus I chanced upon Futari wa Pretty Cure about 6 years ago in a newspaper review in The New Paper. The preview picture looked a bit intriguing to me, so I gave it a shot.<br />
<br />
Basically, what do you get when you pit your typical Mahou Shoujo anime, with a genius directing mind? You get what Sailor Moon failed to do. Pretty Cure is one of those easy-to-skip over animes because of its looks alone, but when you find out it&#039;s done by the directing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31021">
        mind of DBZ director, Daisuke Nishio (which is why he&#039;s in my favorite people list)... you&#039;ll probably still not be impressed. But regardless, that&#039;s why I&#039;m here. Let&#039;s get on with the review.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The sad thing about 99% of Mahou Shoujo animes is that, there really isn&#039;t MUCH story to cover at all. They&#039;re usually filled with filler, followed by a fight, followed by the girls WINNING the fight, followed by more exposition, followed by end credits.<br />
<br />
Now when something important DOES happen, they actually focus on that one element throughout the entire episode, and it usually lasts about 3-4 episodes total before it building up to the final battle.<br />
<br />
Precure is no different from normal Mahou Shoujo animes. It falls victim to filler, but really plies its trade when it comes to the important details. For story, not much to go on, but at least it&#039;s important.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The artists must have been on SOMETHING when they came up with this crackshot of a transformation sequence. The detail that goes into making the outfits for the girls, along with making the attacks really put the detail levels up to a high.<br />
<br />
I applaud ANY artist and animator of any Mahou Shoujo anime, and Precure is no exception.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
For an anime based on friendship, overcoming hardships and fighting the darkness in our hearts, the difference in the two main lead heroines is like night and day. You have Nagisa, the sporty, tomboyish one and loves sports, and then you have Honoka, the strong, silent type who is also the school&#039;s resident genius.<br />
<br />
See what I mean by night and day? How these two came to be friends is your imagination... but it&#039;s blatantly obvious how they became friends.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t really skip over this anime if you&#039;re an anime enthusiast like me. But if magical girls aren&#039;t your thing, you can stay away from this anime if you want. Those who do want action in something this cute should probably give this a shot.<br />
<br />
Overall, highly, HIGHLY recommended.

    I&#039;m a big fan of the magical girl genre, so I decided it was about time I watched Pretty Cure, a show which has had 7 seasons so far. I don&#039;t know if the other six seasons are any good, but the first one certainly wasn&#039;t, which has put me off watching the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
Basically, Nagisa and Honoka meet Mipple and Mepple and find out that they&#039;re the legendary soldiers, Pretty Cure, destined to protect the Garden of Light from the Dark Zone. And that is pretty much it. The entire series is basically filler, with Nagisa and Honoka fighting one enemy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47325">
        after another from the Dark Zone in every single episode. There are no major plot twists and the romance between Nagisa and Fujipi-senpai doesn&#039;t seem to go anywhere. Possibly the most interesting thing that happened was the introduction of new enemies halfway through the series.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
The art was the best aspect of the show for me. There was nothing wrong with it, but at the same time, it wasn&#039;t amazing. I did, however, like the character designs and the Pretty Cure costumes. Other than that, nothing really stood out for me.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
The sound was not particularly memorable. Like the art, it was acceptable, but uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
Nagisa and Honoka had the potential to become excellent characters - if they had been given any character development, which they weren&#039;t. Nagisa also got on my nerves with her constant wails of, &#039;Arienai!&#039; As for Mipple and Mepple, I seriously wanted to strangle them. They were the most annoying mascots I&#039;ve ever seen in a magical girl series. Porun was also incredibly irritating, and I found myself growing a large dislike for pretty much everybody in the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
As I said before, the whole series was pretty much filler. Whilst I enjoyed the battle scenes in the first few episodes, it soon got stale and boring for me. I never enjoyed it and I ended up forcing myself to watch it, sticking to a strict schedule of 2 episodes on weekdays, 5 at weekends, so I could finish it as soon as possible. Watching it felt like a chore.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
Pretty Cure is probably the worst magical girl show I&#039;ve seen. It was boring and unenjoyable and I wouldn&#039;t reccommend it. Of course, it&#039;s all a matter of taste - there&#039;s many people who have loved this first season and given it 10s.  Perhaps the other seasons are better - this one, however, was very disappointing.

    A lot of the older &quot;fighting hero&quot; type shows have something about them that all the modern day ones do not. While I&#039;m unsure what that is, it always seems to be the 90&#039;s shows that entertain me no matter what their target demographic is.<br />
<br />
Pretty cure is almost exactly what you&#039;d expect a magical girl anime aimed at pre and early teens, to be. Each and every episode is an excuse to kick ass. However unlike some shows of this age, Pretty Cure ties it all in despite being 49 episodes long, making it seem like there are no fillers and every episode, whether it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179753">
        even just be character development, is there for a reason. They go though their everyday school life while dealing with things an everyday student of that age would deal with. Only, to make it more entertaining, they throw in magic powers and someone to beat up every episode with the final battles spanning over a few episodes.<br />
<br />
The art, for today&#039;s age cant be held much for trail as what&#039;s released today is much sharper and higher quality, not to mention the animation progressions allow more moving objects to be on screen at any one time. However for it own time of the late 90&#039;s, this is surprising well done, even for a childrens show. The occasional 3D for some items or major beings, while is clearly noticeable in the show, it still blends in astoundingly well. From there the rest of the animation can be jumpy at, time of large battles and seem like too much is happening too fast. However rarely does the animation noticeable stand out from the background and scenery as it all blends well and makes it all seem it was made together and not animations done over a still canvas. But then comes in irritably noticeable time scenes are reused. Some to the point where you lose count and just make you skip past it back to the actual show.<br />
<br />
Music was very off and on. Many times were themes reused every single episode. Although there were a few themes that will actually make you move to the beat they&#039;re that catchy. Whether you like rock, jazz, orchestra or something more funk. Precure has it and it does it well.<br />
<br />
Character is everywhere. From main to secondary and villains. Everyone has their own personality and for a school setting, they&#039;re played amazingly on key, its astounding how relate-able they can be. While there main two heroines are the shows main focus, there are episodes where even the secondary character get a lot of character development and it really works with tying into the main characters story line as it is called upon and mentioned in later episodes.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is... Well quite touch and go, while it has many entertaining parts. It has just as many cringe worthy moments that made you want to skip ahead. They seemed to go quite hand in hand as every second episode one or the other seems to happen. Lastly while each episode, when you take out the into and endings, is about 21 mins you still end up skipping more when you take into account the reused scenes that get really freaking boring to see every single episode.

    Don&#039;t make this your first Precure.<br />
<br />
I had mixed feelings toward this series even beyond the halfway point before I made up my mind on what I thought of it, and those thoughts never really changed or felt challenged afterwards: that this is a wholly average, yet enjoyable series.<br />
<br />
The show developed a good bond between Nagisa and Honoka and fleshed out their respective personalities quite well. This extended to the fairies also, which is more noteworthy in Mepple&#039;s and Popo&#039;s cases because I didn&#039;t like either of them at first. The villains&#039; personalities and motives fluctuated a lot in quality, but overall I thought they were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review247280">
        quite serviceable.<br />
<br />
The plot was a lot more shaky and was the overall low point of this Precure iteration. Although there were definitely highlight episodes in relation to the plot, the big picture always felt very simplistic, and while that in itself isn&#039;t a bad thing, the straightforward nature or the villains&#039; goals (regardless of their motives) combined with the repetitive feel this iteration had at times made the majority of the plot aspect feel lackluster. I do caveat that the ending was still pretty great and surprisingly bittersweet though.<br />
<br />
Regarding themes, this is the first Precure I&#039;ve encountered that was so theme-light, which unfortunately also contributes to its non-standout nature. There&#039;s a vague idea of never giving up and keeping hope that is conveyed, but little more.<br />
<br />
And as for the action, the Precure claim to fame, it was serviceable and on occasion well choreographed, but rarely ever well animated. For as much as I&#039;ve seen Futari wa Precure hailed for the Cures getting their hands dirty with the action, I can&#039;t help but think those claims are somewhat exaggerated.<br />
<br />
All of that being said, aside from some of the repetitive aspects there&#039;s very little I could point to that the series actually did &quot;wrong&quot;, and the characters carried it pretty well enjoyment-wise. Futari wa Precure did the bare minimum I&#039;d require from the mahou shoujo genre and as such it will in some ways work as a baseline for me going forward. This show is the line where, if a mahou shoujo isn&#039;t at least doing this well, I&#039;m going to start levying criticisms more heavily and will consider dropping the series.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if you can handle the repetitive aspects in Futari wa Precure, you can probably handle them in, say, Sailor Moon as well, and Sailor Moon gets much much better than this series does when it gets good, so if given the choice I would rather relegate this series moreso to people who are already mahou shoujo fans or those who really want the historical context. It&#039;s just not standout enough to recommend to most people outside those categories.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re interested, then go for it. Just be aware of where your expectations ought to be. Even within the Precure franchise there are iterations better at pretty much anything you could want from a mahou shoujo, be it great characterization, a great plot, great thematic development, or just great action. As such I&#039;d ask that others don&#039;t base their views of the franchise on this installment, especially if they insist on this one as their first Precure.

    Being an avid PreCure consumer, I really wanted to like the first season. The main girls are very easy to have a fondness for, even though, disregarding an episode or two, they are written with very one-dimensional personalities! One of them is the brute and the other is the brains! It wouldn&#039;t have been so hard to endure the first season, if it hadn&#039;t been for the horrible video quality. The static and cracking in the audio made it so that I could barely sit through a couple of episodes, without getting a headache, and the soundtrack was filled with belches and gooey-sounding noises that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review368963">
        didn&#039;t jive well, in a cartoon for GIRLS! Despite my criticisms of the first series, I will try the subsequent seasons out, after my eardrums have recovered!<br />

⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️<br />

I had high hopes when I first watched the pilot episode of &quot;Futari wa PreCure&quot; — like the first season of To LOVEる, there seemed to be a sense of aesthetic camp: after the mascots propositioned the girls to become magical girls, the two of them asked a ton of questions and made meta-references to other cartoons. It wasn&#039;t the usual docile nod that a magical girl gives when her friend is in trouble, or something; it was like two normal friends in an anime, who actually have the mind to see the dubiousness of their situation. It reminded me of the magical moment in To LOVEる, where Zastin (an armored space invader) walks upright on Rito&#039;s bed, while speaking in Takehito Koyasu&#039;s voice, and it naturally freaks the poor kid out! <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, &quot;Futari wa PreCure&quot; drops the notion of having an interesting, magical girl narrative after episode one... it momentarily resumes the unique vantage point in ※episode eight. The rest of the series is basically a monster-of-the-week bonanza — fighting various tokusatsu-like, human replicants! There are typical tropes seen in Japanese children&#039;s series, like: a school trip gone wrong, parents get captured by the bad guys, and Honoka even has a crush on a generic guy, named Fuji-P, despite there being implied &quot;ho yay&quot; between her and Nagisa!<br />

※Mr. Nishio is the main director on the project, but the only episode that I liked out of the first season of forty-nine episodes was Episode 8: &quot;Pretty Cure Breaks Up! Isn&#039;t It Too Soon For That!?&quot; and incidentally, that is the only episode that Takuya Igurashi directs.<br />
<br />
Commentary: The original Pretty Cure series was handed off to several different directors during its production, because of this the tone felt odd and often very disjointed. The audio quality is some of the worst that I&#039;ve ever heard, and the earliest full-length anime TV series that I&#039;ve seen is from 1972. This series originally aired in 2004 and the DVD release has audio with static loud enough to pop my ears. The sound effects are very squishy sounding and gross, not something you want to hear in a cartoon made for little girls... not to mention that there were really jarring cuts between: the scenes, the eye-catches, and the transitions from episode-to-episode. Mr. Nishio made the same mistakes in his production of &quot;Air Master&quot; — but that was more tolerable, because the mood in that show makes it seem as if the slipshod visual direction was intentional, because of the campiness of the plot. I feel like I would have at least rated this series two scores higher, if the experience of watching it wasn&#039;t so grating.<br />
<br />
Takuya Igurashi (episode director), notable works:<br />
* Ashita no Nadja ✅<br />
* Bungō Stray Dogs —series ✅<br />
* Captain Earth<br />
* Ojamajo Doremi —series ✅<br />
* Ōran High School Host Club ✅<br />
* Soul Eater ✅<br />
* Star Driver ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: The aforementioned &quot;Episode 8&quot; is a clear cut above the rest. Even on a low budget, the way the shots are framed makes the bland series seem like there&#039;s more to be said. This episode really conveys the two girls dual personalities and their feelings for each other, more intimately than all of the rest.<br />
<br />
Good Seiyū Work = ✅<br />
<br />
Really Enjoyed the Seiyū&#039;s Performance = ✅ ✅<br />
<br />
One of Luna&#039;s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅<br />
<br />
Yōko Honna as Nagisa Misumi (&quot;Cure Black&quot;), notable roles:<br />
* Asta, .hack —series<br />
* Vermouth, Detective Conan ✅ ✅<br />
* Iva, Karneval (TV)<br />
* Ange, Koisuru Tenshi Angelique<br />
* Taeko Okajima, Omoide Poroporo (&quot;Only Yesterday&quot;) ✅ ✅ ✅<br />
* Vasilisa, Toaru Majutsu no Index<br />
* Lalaco Godspeed, Uchū Patrol Luluco ✅<br />
<br />
Commentary: Ms. Honna characterizes Nagisa&#039;s haphazard, adventurous personality very well. Her stubborn, yet caring attitude towards Honoka is apparent in her subtle gestures and tones. Wonderful work!<br />
<br />
Yukana as Honoka Yukishiro (&quot;Cure White&quot;), notable roles:<br />
* Yuri Tanima, Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach<br />
* Mina Nakanotani, Air Master ✅ ✅<br />

<br />
Commentary: Ms. Yukana does such a great job at making Honoka adorable, studious, and although she can be harsh, she is a really good friend to Nagisa. Her cerebral and attentive attitude often gets the two of them out of some sticky situations. Excellent seiyū!<br />
<br />
Overall, this series was the weakest link, along with the television series for &quot;Smile PreCure!&quot; — the film for that show was pretty dang awesome, though! As I stated in the introductory paragraph, I will try another season, in the &quot;Futari wa&quot; continuity, I haven&#039;t watched this particular series in a few years, so I think I should be fine now! I give &quot;Futari wa PreCure&quot; a 1/10 — the croaky audio quality, the modest variety of animation frames used, and unambitious script-writing left a lot to be desired.<br />

    I love magical girl themed anime&#039;s and thought i&#039;d give this one a go; My expectations were let down started off pretty well enough.<br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
Nagisa and Honoka meet Mipple and Mepple and find out that they&#039;re the legendary soldiers, Pretty Cure, destined to protect the Garden of Light from the Dark Zone and rest was fillers. I enjoyed the story but after a few ep&#039;s got boring and the fight scene&#039;s were becoming dull repeating the same battle movement and till half way through 1st one marble screw! 2nd rainbow marble screw such creativity and really original. Most of the ep&#039;s were just nagisa and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47641">
        honoka going to school and they get attacked by dark zone i got bored half way through but i kept to it and watched it all.<br />
<br />
5/10<br />
Art was decent enough well drawn backgrounds and the outfits i liked weren&#039;t over the top but yet keeping the magical girl theme.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Average for a magical girl anime; wasn&#039;t that bad but wasn&#039;t really that good either.<br />
<br />
Character: 3/10<br />
Nagisa and Honoka I liked them as characters and did have the potential to be good characters but after awhile nagisa got annoying and wanted to hit in the face. Mepple+Mipple annoying mascots ever existence and porun i wanted to strangle him and shut him up. not much character development at times i could connect emotionally to the story but was very rare.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3/10<br />
I didn&#039;t really enjoy it that much some aspects that pealed to me while others just annoyed me to no end.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3/10<br />
I didn&#039;t really want to bother with other seasons after watching this one; Was boring and poorly made i wouldn&#039;t suggest this one to any-one to be quite honest.<br />

    I&#039;m a Pretty Cure fan and I love this series!But this season is not for me.. I already watched other seasons and in comparison with this one, the others stand out so much more! I know lots of people love it but it&#039;s an okay season at best..<br />
<br />
STORY 4/10<br />
The girls find two fairies and become Pretty Cure, together they have to fight agains the Dark King and his minions and protect the garden of light and that&#039;s it. The story is decent enough to a magical girl series, not many twists happens and after the 2nd half the plot is very repetitive and boring.<br />
<br />
ART 7/10<br />
It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review349731">
        good, it had great moments in some fights but that&#039;s it, doesn&#039;t have much to talk about it. <br />
<br />
SOUND 6/10<br />
It&#039;s fine, I barely remember any soundtracks but I think they do their job well!<br />
<br />
CHARACTER 3/10<br />
Nagisa is kinda annoying with her crush on Fujipi and how she&#039;s always mumbling about being a Pretty Cure and such, overall very annoying for a main character. Honoka is good, but she&#039;s barely explored, besides having a friendship with one of the villains, Kiryia, she doesn&#039;t get any spotlight. The fairies are terrible and super irritating, sometimes I just wanted to throw them far away or strangle them, sorry. The bond between Nagisa and Honoka is very well done in the first episodes, but after that nothing much happens and the series gets very static. However the bond between the fairies and the girls is pretty bad, most of the time they&#039;re just being annoying to the girls and they never develop from that or have any changes. As for the villains, they exist that&#039;s it, there&#039;s nothing interesting to talk about them,except for Poisonee, yeah I think she had cool strategies and a good design. Overall the main characters are meeh at best, they barely get any character development. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT 3/10<br />
The 1st half is okay, the first episodes were interesting enough, cause we got the bonding between Nagisa and Honoka and we also get Kiryia changing sides, but after they &quot;defeat&quot; the Dark King for the first time, the plot got super boring and I barely could have any enjoyment from it. I just finished this season cause I&#039;m a Pretty Cure Fan, if I wasn&#039;t I would probably just drop it. Tbh, I wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone to start with this season, if the person wants to get into the PreCure world. Just start with other more great seasons, there are a lot of them. <br />

    I&#039;m not sure how much Toei had planned for Pretty Cure, but I really doubt that, at the time of this review, they expected it to be already close to start its 16th entry with Star Twinkle. In my way to watch all the franchise it finally came the time to tackle the original, that I wouldn&#039;t recommend as your first Precure, the fantastic main duo makes this anime well worth a watch and did overall did a great job building the foundation for one of the most successful series in Japan.<br />
<br />
The premise is pretty simple yet effective: A big baddie wants to take over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297839">
        literally everything with the power of the seven stones, and to prevent that, our main characters, with the help of strange but pretty cute creatures, recieve the power to become Precure, giving them superhuman powers that they will use in big amounts to kick the ass of any villain (mostly in a monster of the week format) that comes to take the stones they have while hopefully trying to recover the other ones lost.<br />
<br />
Outside of the obvious action elements that the series has due to the premise, what really makes or breaks the franchise to me is the characters and their interactions, and I think that they did a great job with the first main characters of Precure. Nagisa and Honoka are two girls with very different personalities and nothing they really shared outside of being in the same class, but after becoming Precure they are basically forced to be close to each other in order to save the day because they can&#039;t transform individually, this means lots and lots of interactions between them and if they weren&#039;t entertaining and the development of their friendship wasn&#039;t satisfying the series would have fallen apart hard, but that thankfully isn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is pretty good but nothing special with an exception. The mascot characters are good source of comedy (especially Mepple and Nagisa moments) but sometimes they can be annoying as well, especially in the second half of the series, the villains are pretty one-note but their interactions and personalities are solid and quite entertaining to watch, there is a exception to that with one of them which is a character I personally loved due to his personal struggles, lastly there is the classmates which get the spotlight from time to time and while they aren&#039;t particularly memorable, they always give a push for more development for the main duo.<br />
<br />
Now it&#039;s time to comment the other part of what makes Precure be Precure: the action scenes, and boy this first entry already did a very nice job showing that element! The fights are well animated and fun to watch, with lots of punches, kicks, and whatever movements the girls think of to gain the upper hand. They also get hit back hard and in some cases the situation is completely overwhelming for them, especially when the villains attack personally and not via calling a monster (something that Futari wa does way more than the other Precure I watched), this makes the fights tense which only adds to the enjoyment. The music of this anime is also solid with some rarely used (which is a good thing) inserts that add a lot of impact to the scenes where they play, making them very memorable.<br />
<br />
Even if maybe I didn&#039;t talk that well of the side characters, all I have said so far has been pretty positive, so why do I say that I don&#039;t recommend it as first Precure? Well, this anime honestly suffers from repetitiveness. This isn&#039;t something particular from this entry due to the monster of the week format of the franchise (and I suffered it pretty notably with the first half of Heartcatch too) but while others like Princess or Hugtto use well their settings or themes to give variety, or Smile just does whatever it wants and it&#039;s freaking hilarious, Futari wa gets quite stale even when switching focus to side characters or events like Nagisa playing lacrosse or the small romance element this anime has with a senpai of her.<br />
<br />
As the first entry (and so the one that has to create everything for the rest to adopt, change and/or improve) it also struggles with the transformation scene of the girls, and in general with the stock footage used, being pretty unimpressive, the girls also do attacks together and so one pretty much only sees two or three different magic attacks through the series in comparison to the better looking and more varied attacks that future entries have for the characters.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the story of this first season is also split into two parts, with the first being pretty well paced but the second not adding enough to keep things fresh even if it still has nice episodes and more satisfying development for the main duo. I read that this series was originally meant to be two cours but went longer (up to the nearly 100 episodes including the sequel Max Heart) due to its popularity, and if true I&#039;m not surprised at all with how I felt about the second half and worries me a decent amount for how the sequel will avoid getting stale.<br />
<br />
Did that put you off? I can totally see why people would dislike this anime, way more than with any other Precure I watched so far (that to be fair are mostly the praised ones), yet I think that this anime is nice and well worth a watch thanks to Nagisa, Honoka, their interactions, and the already awesome fights this franchise has from the first season, but for that I think that one already needs to be into Precure thanks to another entry to know well what the franchise is capable of to get really in the mood for this one. I have read from other people (and I feel that I myself would have felt the same way) that started with Precure via Futari wa and eventually quit because they found it too repetitive and expected the rest of the series to be the same way. I&#039;m sure that some people who will read this review actually watched this one first and loved it and watched the rest too, but from my point of view I would recommend to try some other ones first (and I have/will write reviews for them too!) Before watching this one.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, while flawed, Futari wa Precure is an anime that also did things right and created the starting point of an amazing franchise that keeps providing hours and hours of fun up to this date, stay strong Precure!

    The mahou shoujo genre has come a long way since its beginnings in Himitsu no Akko-chan, and today it is almost as wide as pizza topping options. We have series that are cute and series that are dark; series with magic beams of lights and series with mecha piloting; Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen and Mahou Shoujo no Ore. Things have changed a lot since the sixties, huh?<br />
<br />
One of the stepping stones of these changes is Futari wa Pretty Cure (literally “We Are Pretty Cure”), which started airing in 2004. The first in a franchise that nowadays includes more than fifteen titles, this series was one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294306">
        of the first to join the idea of physical action with the concept of the magical girl. The power of friendship is discussed as a theme when applied to the way Nagisa and Honoka — the two girls in the title — learn how to connect to each other despite their different dispositions and interests.<br />
<br />
I started watching the anime with the intention of learning a little more about the mahou shoujo genre, but, after 49 episodes, I have to say I am disappointed. <br />
<br />
The framework of the story is simple: Nagisa and Honoka are chosen by two beings from a parallel universe called “The Garden of Light” to protect the Prism Stones, a bunch of jewels that hold the power of creation. To get those stones, the villains use evil spirits called Zakenna, which possess the objects around the Pretty Cure and turn them into monsters. The plot never really goes beyond; we don’t know where these people came from, where are they going to, what exactly are they and how things work in their world. Simplicity can often be a positive trait in a series — here I am thinking about series like Bleach, so lost in their own plot points they’re never going to get out of that mess —, but here it ends up leading to shallowness. It’s hard to worry about the destiny of the Garden of Light when we’re too busy wondering why is their queen giant and how can she speak without moving her mouth.<br />
<br />
The episodes are mostly formulaic, intertwining problems that the girls face in their day-to-day lives with their Pretty Cure fights. That is not a negative aspect in and of itself; times were different and it was more important to have a long contract than a practical plot. What truly annoyed me about this is the way everyone — villains included — go out of their way to keep this formula, for *no reason at all*. Why do the villains care that no one at the school figures out Nagisa and Honoka are the Pretty Cure? I don’t know, but there they go, conveniently putting all the other girls to sleep before summoning the Pretty Cure to a fight.<br />
<br />
By the way, the villains’ lack of common sense comes dangerously close to stupidity. They soon figure out the girls’ civilian identities, without any big “eureka moment” — and proceed to do nothing useful with the information afterwards. Barring a few exceptions, they never go after them at their home, only at school, and conveniently after classes. They never go straight for Mepple and Mipple; they always wait for the girls to transform and fight them. They get to the point of *saving them* from *their own attacks*, because “it would be harder to get the Prism Stones from you if you’re dead”. I’m sorry, but isn’t it easier to take something off an unconscious person?! Nagisa and Honoka are always yelling about how “they’re never gonna forgive” the villains for some reason or another, but, considering everything they *could* have done, I think the girls got off easy.<br />
<br />
Most of the villains also lack personality or interesting motivation; they have a single funny character trait and that’s about it. This a problem with most of the secondary characters, but for one or two people (Honoka’s grandma, you’re a lighthouse in a stormy sea of shoujo). I have to acknowledge the fact that the anime tries hard: conflicts are set up some episodes before, and their consequences continue to be brought up episodes later; characters we met in standalone episodes show up again with the marks from their contact with the Pretty Cure. But, in the end, it seems like the interactions lack sincerity? To me, the big emotional moments always feel a little forced — though that might be due to the fact I never managed to get into the series’ way of doing things. (And the less we say about how annoying Mepple is, the better.)<br />
<br />
The animation itself was another thing that bothered me. Yes, it’s pretty amazing to have magical girls punching the villains on the face, but Nagisa and Honoka fight like string dolls. Getting stronger because of the transformation is one thing — changing directions mid-jump to spin like a drill is quite another. The visual aspect of the characters is great (with the exception of Belzei, who looks like a Dragon Ball Z background character who was rejected from Freeza’s army), but the girls are often badly drawn and badly animated, even in traditionally important moments like their special attacks.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, the soundtrack is good; it’s comforting when it needs to be, exciting otherwise, and it probably constitutes the only interesting aspect about the villains. The opening song is surprisingly catchy, and not in a bad way; it’s easy to catch yourself singing “pretty de, cure-cure” without meaning to after watching five episodes at a time. My biggest problem was the ending song, which not only has nothing to do with the show at all, but is also filled with weird screaming in the background that totally kills the mood. The studio’s decision to keep it as the only ending theme for the 49 episodes *and* to choose it as the girls’ choir song later on probably didn’t help any.<br />
<br />
In the end, I must say that, for such an influent anime series, Futari wa Pretty Cure lacks quality. There are good moments, but, even at its best, the series doesn’t quite catch up with other classics of the mahou shoujo genre. That said, I can see that there was an effort to build a good story, which is a point on its favor. I am sure many people have had fun with this series and many more will have fun with it in the future, but, in my opinion, if you’re looking for mahout shoujo anime that *really* makes you feel something, you should skip this one.

    Synopsis &amp; Plot:<br />
	Pretty Cure is the first Precure! of the Precure! series. It features Nagisa Misumi and Honoka Yukishiro, two girls of Verone Junior High’s 2nd year Sakura class. One night Nagisa makes a wish to be noticed by boys instead of girls and is greeted by a strange creature named Mepple from the Garden of Light. Honoka finds a box containing a cellphone that turns into Mipple, the Princess of Hope. Mepple and Mipple were sent from the Garden of Light to find Pretty Cure and gather and protect the Seven Prism Stones from the inhabitants of the Dark Zone. From that point on,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34971">
        Nagisa and Honoka fight the Dark Warriors as Cure Black and Cure White to protect the Garden of Light and their own realm, the Garden of Rainbows. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
	Nagisa Misumi is the ace of Verone Junior High’s lacrosse team and Honoka is a member of the science club. The most compatible match? Hardly. But the two make it work over time. Nagisa is tomboyish and athletic and it shows when often she spaces out to think about takoyaki or chocolate. Honoka on the other hand is more literal and at random times blurts out information that really doesn’t need to be known. The combo of the athletic Nagisa and the brainy Honoka makes for interesting interaction between our Precures throughout the series.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Graphics:<br />
	The art in the anime is acceptable; nothing to particularly wow you but it’s nothing that will turn you off either. At some points in the series, you’ll notice the quality of the art being a little lower than usual while at others, you’ll notice it better than usual. This being a Mahou Shoujo, I have to talk about the transformation scene in the art section. At first, I wasn’t impressed with it comparing it to things like Sailor Moon, Nanoha and Corrector Yui but after a while I got used to it. Their Precure attacks were particularly fun to watch, especially in the second arc of the series. In fact, they were one of the highlights of the episodes :D<br />
<br />
Music &amp; Sound:<br />
	The opening and ending themes were typical cardboard Mahou Shoujo songs; perky, upbeat and girly. At first I listened to them but after a while you just find them stuck in your head playing over and over all perky like. On the point of voice acting, Yukana’s voice as Honoka jumped out at me instantly. She’s so kawaii ^_^. Nagisa on the other hand is voiced by Youko Honna who I’d never heard in an anime before. At the beginning I thought her to be a little annoying but by episode 10 or so, I got used to her catchphrase ‘Arienaiiiiiii’ every episode. One thing that I HAVE to mention talking about voice acting was the way they said the names of their attacks. I never got tired of hearing them chant ‘Black Thunder! White Thunder! Pretty Cure Marble Screw!’ all through the series. I was able to pick out Yukana especially from the duo and she sounded extra cute saying it. All in all, a great job by Youko-san and Yukana-san.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Closing Comments:<br />
	Being a fan of Mahou Shoujo because of their light friendly atmosphere that’s able to pick me up when I’m feeling down or just in the mood for some cute. Pretty Cure was no disappointment. It was a little slow at times and I thought the story dragged a little toward the end but Mahou Shoujo fans will like Pretty Cure. The typical and cliché elements like young love and balancing their fight for justice with their regular lives are important in this series and it shows up quite a lot throughout the show. All in all I gave the show a 7. It lost points for slow pacing, the drop in art at some points and the cardboard sound of the opening and ending. Despite these things though, a mahou shoujo should take some time to watch this enjoyable series. <br />

    This is your cliché magical girl anime, but as one of the first (and THE first of the precure series), there is something nostalgic about it. <br />
<br />
The characters are likeable enough, and though it&#039;s been a hot minute since I&#039;ve seen it, I remember really enjoying the story itself. It kind of builds the world of precure, giving it a history and context. <br />
<br />
The transformations are cute, the outfits are cute, everything is very cute. What really deterred me is - and this is a personal preference - I&#039;m hard-pressed to enjoy any type of entertainment without romance. The show/movie/book has to be AMAZING for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396136">
        me to look past a lack of romance.<br />
<br />
That said, there&#039;s a brief romance between a couple characters in this show that at least kept me hanging on. Bottom line: if you enjoy magical girl anime and you want a taste of nostalgia but you&#039;re sick of rewatching Sailor Moon, this is a great choice!

    EDIT: Fixed up some writing errors and strange wording<br />
VERY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD<br />
Also: I wrote this at like 11 PM on my phone so it may not <br />
<br />
<br />
Futari wa Pretty Cure is the first series in an extremely long magical girl franchise, Pretty Cure. To put in perspective how long it is, at the time of this writing, the name of the 16th series had just been announced (Star Twinkle Pretty Cure). Because of this series&#039;s popularity, a sequel was created, then another sequel, and another...<br />
In fact, Precure was originally going to be only about 26 episodes and end at what is now the mid-season finale

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292435">
        fight with Kiriya and the Dark Zone but because of popular demand, more were made.<br />
<br />
When I first watched this show I didn’t care about the action, only the magical girls :/ I actually discovered the Precure franchise while watching my younger sister play GirlsGoGames. They have 5 Precure dress-ups (which was really strange because at the time only 1 season was licensed in America) with the theme for this show playing in the background. A few months pass and I’m browsing YouTube. I find a video called Top 10 Magical Girl Transformations or something like that, and I clicked on it (I used to watch a ton of magical girl transformations just by themselves). At least half of the list had Precure transformations so I decided to look the show up. Later that day I started watching it and it’s now one of my favorite magical girl anime.<br />
<br />
STORY: 7/10<br />
The story is above average, but if the 2 main characters didn’t work so well together it would probably be just your run-of-the-mill “save the magical cute creature planet from the generic dark kingdom” story.<br />
<br />
ART: 6.5/10 <br />
The artists were not afraid to bend Nagisa’s and Honoka’s bodies around for the crazy fight scenes—and that’s perfectly okay. It gives the show an art style that I feel really mixes shonen art and shoujo art together, which I liked. However, that’s only in fight scenes. The rest is just an average 2000’s anime with mostly mouth movement. <br />
Also, I really like the outfits: they look like a classic magical girl outfit with the front bow and all but also very practical. They don&#039;t have layers and layers of ruffles but are still cute.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10<br />
My favorite part of this show is the soundtrack. The orchestra makes the music seem more dramatic and really adds to all the epic battles and even the slice of life scenes. I actually have a CD from this show because I love the soundtrack so much. The OP and ED are really catchy too. I think the OP won a “best theme song of 2004” at some anime award event, but I’ll have to make sure.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 6/10<br />
The worst part of this series is definitely the characters. While the two protagonists are very well developed, most other characters aren&#039;t, especially the villains. A few examples of good characters other than Nagisa and Honoka are Kiriya and Honoka&#039;s grandma.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 7/10<br />
Despite my complaints, I really love this anime. I don&#039;t think that the staff at Toei were originally expecting for the show to be as popular as it was, however, they learned from the mistakes in this season and continued to improve. The show is mostly uphill from here. I think if you like magical girl, action sequences, orchestral music, and the power of friendship (I enjoy all of those things)you will really enjoy this show.<br />

    This was my first introduction to the precure franchise and I deeply regret it. I should have just watched the show that initially got me interested in the franchise from the beginning, Heartcatch Precure, but no, I just had to be stubborn about it and convince myself to start at the very beginning. <br />
<br />
At first, I was kind of intrigued because, as a fan of the magical girl genre, I&#039;d rarely seen a show with only two magical girls. Usually, the shows either tend to have a large group of girls or focus on one single protagonist, so I thought it was a bit refreshing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340387">
        Plus, their concept was kind of unique too, or at least the black and white character design certainly was. The girls themselves aren&#039;t that unique personality-wise. It&#039;s basically ying and yang, they&#039;re opposites of one another. One is smart and sophisticated and the other is a sporty tomboy. Honestly, I think that the characters are the only thing pulling this whole show together and making it barely watchable. <br />
<br />
The story itself is pretty poor, really basic plot and very repetitive. Objectively, the show is about a 5, average, but since it&#039;s so repetitive it turns unbearable after a while. In the beginning, I was really trying but the more I watched, the more bored and just tired I became of this show. There&#039;s 49 episodes of basically the same thing over and over. I simply couldn&#039;t take it anymore and so, had to drop it, something which I rarely do. And I honestly couldn&#039;t care any more or less whether or not the story gets better later on, it&#039;s just not worth it. <br />
<br />
Anyways, after this I watched Heartcatch Precure and absolutely loved it. Didn&#039;t need to watch any of the previous shows in order to get it. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, whatever you do DO DON&#039;T WATCH FUTARI WA PRECURE AS YOUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THIS FRANCHISE! It&#039;s one of the weakest out of all the precure series. Just watch whichever one that interests you the most. I personally recommend Heartcatch Precure and Smile Precure!
