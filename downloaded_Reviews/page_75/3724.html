Personal Opinion<br />
So I&#039;ll confess... ever since I had an embarrassing walk-in by my friends when I was intently watching Sailor Moon when I was 7 years old, I have avoided the mahou shoujo (magical girl) genre of anime.  A week or so before writing this post, I managed to convince myself to get over this irrational fear.  So now i write this post as my first completed Mahou Shoujo anime in over 11 years.<br />

Okay, so to tell the truth, Nanatsuiro Drops isn&#039;t like most mahou shoujo animes.  From what I read, a lot of MS animes have romance in as a side-genre... In Nanatsuiro Drops, Romance is the main genre and MS is a side genre.  ND is nothing more than the cute story of first love.  ... okay that was an understatement.  Nanatsuiro was probably the CUTEST lovestory that I have EVER seen.  Just every aspect about it warms your heart.  Sumomo, even though her crying can get annoying, is one of the cutest protagonists that I&#039;ve ever seen.  She&#039;s incredibly shy, somewhat weak, has a tendency to cry, quite clumsy... As Konata from Lucky Star would say... &amp;quot;She&#039;s a walking pillar of turn-ons&amp;quot;. And the show only gets cuter... especially when the main two character deals with their feelings for each other.  And then, when it got to the ending.... It melted my manly heart  :_)<br />
<br />
There were a few problems with some of the characters, and I would&#039;ve liked to see more background info on a lot of the characters<br />
<br />
Other then that... this anime is an instant remedy to depression that can be taken many time without fear of overdose.<br />
<br />
RATING: 8/10<br />
<br />
Similar to...<br />
- Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora<br />
Both are tales of first love, and both couple have to overcome obstacles<br />
<br />
- Shakugan no Shana, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya<br />
Same art style in all of these three.  In fact, the character artworks are done by the same person.

    &amp;ldquo;First love that encompasses you&amp;rdquo; is the tagline of the anime title Nanatsuiro Drops.  A seemly contradictory tagline to what seems to be a magical girl anime.  However, in reality Nanatsuiro Drops is more of a sweet story of one&amp;rsquo;s first love than a magical girl anime.  This is unlike most magical girl anime, where the love story is tacked on.  <br />
<br />
The first thing I noticed was the art style and the animation.  The colors were bright yet very soft, almost dreamlike.  Its quite unique in that respects, the only comparison I can make is with respects to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3178">
        flashback scenes in Mizuiro (2003).  As I said in my Mizuiro review, the art/colors gave it a nostalgic/warm feeling.  The designs in Nanatsuiro Drops are really close to the original ones done by Noizi Ito (Shana, Haruhi, etc), in fact it&amp;rsquo;s the closest I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in any of her works adapted to anime.  In addition, her designs are freakishly cute and combined with the warm/soft colors it creates quite a unique atmosphere.  The ost also adds to the atmosphere, especially during the magical girl scenes.  There&amp;rsquo;s a mysterious/magical feel to the music during those scenes.  The other BGM tracks give off this really warm feel that&amp;rsquo;s very consistent with the anime in general. <br />
<br />
Story-wise, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this as well as all the cliques.  Really not much to say here in regards to the story.  The characters are also pretty clique.  Also, did I mention how much Sumomo cries way too much?  Well she does and cries for the most seemingly pointless things.  I guess that&amp;rsquo;s just the way she is.  Don&amp;rsquo;t watch this if you can&amp;rsquo;t stand crybabies or else you&amp;rsquo;ll end up throwing things at your screen.  However, what makes Nanatsuiro Drops are the cute interactions between the characters, especially between Tsuwabuki and Sumomo.  Their growing relationship is as innocent as you can get, once again referring back to the tagline &amp;ldquo;First love that encompasses you.&amp;rdquo;  There is no sexual tension what so ever, and their thoughts are as pure as you can get, realistic, no but this anime is all about idealizing one&amp;rsquo;s first love.  Which reminds me of the source material, an eroge, a fact that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really accept because the story is do damn innocent.<br />
<br />
Nanatsuiro Drops is a predictable clique filled story that is freakishly cute, in fact its probably too cute for its own damn good.  In addition, the story and the characters are simple, yet nevertheless quite charming/entertaining to watch, a fact that I refuse to acknowledge in real life.  Now if you excuse me I need some insulin shots.  <br />

    This anime is a different form of magical girls that focuses more on the feelings they share between the two main protagonists. The character developments or the change in their characteristics are very classical. This is also a new form of magical &amp;quot;fighting&amp;quot; that doesn&#039;t really fight so if you like cute and peaceful things, it will be ok. The happiness that built up from the beginning leaves you a strong impression at the end where the characters have to endure hardships and sorrow.<br />
<br />
Regard the fact that the characters are cute, the story is nice, it adds a slight touch of humor from time to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1753">
        time makes you laugh out loud once in a while.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for an anime with good animation, this anime is  for you, if you are looking for a magical story with a romantic theme, this anime is definitely for you. If you are looking for an awesome anime overall, this anime is right on the bull&#039;s eye. <br />
<br />
PS.: If you cannot stand cry babies, this is probably not suitable for you.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
I started watching this show with no preconceived notions whatsoever; only learning of it&#039;s less than desirable eroge origins after looking into it a bit more. My initial reason for watching Nanatsuiro Drops was plain and simple: the character design. Yes, very shallow I&#039;m aware. I happen to be a fan of Noizi Ito&#039;s work and had become intrigued when I saw some of her illustrations in one of her art books. Oh how wrong I was.<br />
<br />
Nanatsuiro Drops is a magical-girl, romance anime adaption of UNiSONSHIFT&#039;s adult dating sim of the same name. The initial premise is quite cliche: Boring male student

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9261">
        (Tsuwabuki) encounters magical girl (Sumomo), shenanigans and romance ensue. However this story has a mild twist: Tsuwabuki accidentally drinks a magic potion (conveniently occurring through a mix up of cans between himself and another individual). The result of said potion is Tsuwabuki&#039;s transformation into a small stuffed lamb doll who is referred to as Yuki. Conveniently, the only way for Tsuwabuki to transform back into his human form permanently is if he aides Sumomo (&quot;his chosen girl&quot;) in collecting the Seven Stardrops, all the while hiding his true identity from her. Tsuwabuki transforms to his human form only on a new moon, allowing for some time to confess his romantic affections for Sumomo later on in the story. Nanatsuiro Drops is full of such convenient plot twists; Sumomo just happens to be incredibly advanced in her magical spells with little development or indication of improvement she simply manages to cast spells, the only explanation being the fact that her mother was a brilliant mage. There is no basis for Sumomo&#039;s development  as a magical girl other than her lineage and we are not provided with a sufficient answer. To make matters worse, the mahou-shoujo element of Nanatsuiro Drops begins to fade into the background as the story progresses; it is ever present but feels somewhat tacked on as the focus shifts to the romantic relationship of Sumomo and Tsuwabuki. As the story progresses, the increasing plot twists  become both predictable and incredibly convenient to the point where the story begins to lose any shred of believability or originality it may have initially maintained.If you want something on the lines of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha or Card Captor Sakura, with likable characters and a plot that can be taken somewhat seriously you should probably opt out of sitting through the meager 12 episodes that Nanatsuiro Drops has to offer.<br />

The music for Nanatsuiro Drops is quite mediocre, much like the anime as a whole. The light-hearted girlishness of the OP is fitting and serves to not offend the senses. The BGM is slightly flowery, not really my cup of tea, but again very fitting for such a cute anime.<br />
<br />
It is in the character department that Nanatsuiro Drops truly fails in. We are presented with Tsuwabuki, a boring drab male protagonist who possesses anti-social tendencies and who&#039;s personality seems to be on par with that of a dish-rag. He is the epitome of the generic male lead: apathetic outlook on life paired with interchangeable  characteristics. Sumomo, the main female protagonist can be viewed two ways: either you see her as a super adorable &quot;moe&quot; type girl along the same lines as Mikuru from TMHS (minus the chest of course) or you see her as the incredibly whiny, weak willed sorry excuse for a protagonist that I perceived her to be. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this girl is cute as hell but her consistent crying throughout the series is most irritating after a while. She cries in nearly every episode, a strange notion considering the fluffy, cookie-cutter nature of the story and the world around her. One would assume she wouldn&#039;t have much to cry about but that seems to not be the case. The other characters making up Nanatsuiro drops are standard fair: a rival that morphs into a friend by the end of the series, a supportive &quot;no questions asked&quot; type best friend, a young and attractive male teacher who conveniently is also Sumomo&#039;s uncle and a vast source of knowledge on the seven star drops...you get the point. The only positive thing I can really say about the characters is the fact that the minor characters were not heavily involved in the story. By this I mean we were spared the melodrama of a love-triangle that would have ultimately made this show even worse than it already is.<br />
<br />
For such a short series, it sure became tedious to watch fast and I had to force myself to sit through the rest of the episodes. I just couldn&#039;t get into this. It felt like the target audience was somewhere along the lines of young girls around age 10-12 looking for a feel-good story to sink their newbie anime teeth into, so to speak. A strange notion considering the eroge origins of Nanatsuiro Drops. Despite it&#039;s origins however, NanaDrops is refreshingly innocent, representing a simplistic and highly idealized take on love and relationships. Despite my very low rating, I would definitely recommend this to a younger girl just getting into anime or someone who just wants some mindless fluff. If you&#039;re looking for anything more than that however, you are sadly out of luck here.

    Story: If you love cute then this is the show for you! the story is soooo cute revolving around 2 main characters and their relationship between themselves and others around them, the magic part of the story is also quite nice but they dont last long so thats no problem<br />
<br />
Art: The art is great! i love the style of the eyes and the colours of it, the arts of the magic spells and beautiful ^^<br />
<br />
Sound: Nothing much to say here but some of the background music suits the scene too<br />
<br />
Character: Great development between the 2 main leads and as well as other characters around them<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1536">
        i loved this show its cuteness is 100% and the main girl lead makes it even cuter!<br />
<br />
Overall: All in all i love this show but the magic scenes could do with a litte improvement as it was too basic.... but other then that the cute story and characters were wonderfull! ^^

    I started watching this anime with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. I was just looking for something cute and fluffy and got something completely unexpected. Where this anime is listed as a magical girl anime (and it is) it is so much more than that. The romance in this anime is better than most in any that I&#039;ve watched before.<br />
<br />
The story line was great. This is the first anime I had watched with less than 26 episodes and felt satisfied with the ending. They made you love the characters and by the end you&#039;re cheering them on. The whole &quot;collecting stardrops&quot; thing is typical of any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15405">
        magical girl anime, but the way they didn&#039;t center the entire show around only catching one stardrop each time made me happy.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t watched this in a few days so I&#039;m not really sure how great the sound track was but I went ahead and gave it a high rating. My theory is, if you don&#039;t remember that you hated the sound then they probably did their job right...and if you remember it being brilliant and want to buy the cd then they did an exceptional job. The sound was not exceptional in this one, but it was acceptable. <br />
<br />
I loved the characters...namely Tsuwabuki (Yuki-chan). I thought they were all memorable and you end up feeling for them in the end. There are a few characters that are unexplained and don&#039;t really have a role in the show, but the fillers aren&#039;t as bad as most magical girl anime shows. <br />
<br />
Overall I gave this anime a 9. I was plesently surprised and this is probably one of the maybe two magical girl anime that I would reccomend to those that usually don&#039;t buy into cutesy frilly anime shows, but do enjoy a good romance.

    I have to be honest here; the first impression I had about this anime was less than stellar. This anime has a high school boy as the main character and on top of that, he turns into a sidekick so I expected a lot of perverted moments (despite how cute and colorful it was). Granted, this series was originally an eroge but, with the exception of a few moments, this anime was a lot cleaner than I thought.<br />
<br />
From the beginning, we learn about the main characters we’re going to focus on: Tsuwabuki Masaharu and Akihime Sumomo. It’s shown that Tsuwabuki isn’t that sociable with others,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179292">
        although it seems he’s more introverted than shy or deliberately anti-social. As for Akihime Sumomo, it’s clear that she’s extremely weak, very emotional, and very sensitive.<br />
<br />
This series is actually more focused on the romantic relationship between Tsuwabuki and Akihime than the magical girl aspect. The magical girl aspect, though, is pretty important to the story and the way that the two (unknowingly) bond. After all, Tsuwabuki is her secret sidekick!<br />
<br />
From what the teacher told Tsuwabuki, because of the potion he drank, the transformation to the cute lamb doll is based on the moon’s phases. As long as the moon is out, he’ll turn into Yuki-chan (the name Akihime gave him) until the night’s over. However, during the new moon, he won’t transform for that night while if there’s a full moon, he’s to remain in the sidekick form all day and night – until sunrise. It’s surprising, though, they didn’t do an episode on that (especially since it’d be ripe with fanservice and shenanigans).<br />
<br />
The catch, though, is that Tsuwabuki is not allowed to tell Akihime who he actually is because, otherwise, he’s going to be a stuffed animal forever.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Akihime, or also known as Prima Plam, runs into a rival – a girl from Figurare named Nona Yuki (or Prima Asparas). From there it’s better explained that the reason why Akihime and Nona are capturing the seven star drops because it’s an annual competition between two schools in Figurare: St. Asparas and Pramu Clovis. However, since the student that was initially chosen from Pramu Clovis got sick, they gave the power to Akihime.<br />
<br />
While Akihime herself is weak, she has an innate talent with the “recipes”, or spells, that she uses to catch the star drops. For a while, Nona was determined to figure how and why she was able to until she stumbled about Karin, a legendary Prima who disappeared eighteen years prior to the story after capturing the seven drops. Soon, she was able to put two and two together about Karin and Akihime so (as well as the teacher’s connection with everything), she starts practicing to have a friendly duel with the latter.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Akihime is getting herself stronger, emotionally and mentally. For a while, she had depended on her best friend, Nadeshiko Yaeno, who didn’t seem to mind one bit. In fact, when Nadeshiko saw Akihime capture a stardrop, that was when Akihime revealed her secret to her and she took it in stride.<br />
<br />
Throughout the story, though, it seemed that it was going to be a harem (and it easily could have been) but Nona didn’t seem to be all that interested in Tsuwabuki besides some choice scenes for the misunderstandings to happen. At least, though, they didn’t drag it on for too long and it was pretty painless.<br />
<br />
For an anime that focuses more on the romantic aspect more than the magical girl, it did a decent job on building a relationship on the two main characters. They grew from classmates, fellow club members, friends, and then finally lovers. Granted, with the limited time, the build up suffered a little bit but Tsuwabuki did see her in many different ways, especially during his time as Yuki-chan (which was five months).<br />
<br />
When they did get together, the viewer could easily tell that they genuinely love and care for one another – there was an actual relationship instead of just getting Character A and Character B together. They did go out and they did do little things around school that high school lovers do. In fact, they actually kissed! More than once!<br />
<br />
And when the sad moments came, it came and it hit hard. After Nona became obsessed with becoming more powerful, her ladle got out of control and Tsuwabuki had no choice but to reveal himself as Yuki-chan to help Akihime since she was the only one who could stop it.<br />
<br />
One could feel the sadness Akihime had and the determination to bring him back to his normal. One could feel the emotional hit when the teacher revealed that he’d lose his memories of his time as Yuki-chan once Akihime gathers the last stardrop. And when it happened, it was hard.<br />
<br />
The pain that Akihime had during the last few episodes really had a strong impact with how much she loves Tsuwabuki. During the last few episodes, since Akihime was done with being a Prima, she kept doing her daily activities.  After a month, Tsuwaburi finally remembered, at the very least, the feelings he has for Akihime.<br />
<br />
This anime really does try to focus on the relationship (or at least one aspect) between a magical girl and her sidekick, especially since this is in the sidekick’s point on view, but in the end, it was mostly a romantic story rather than a magical girl one. The story was fine for what it was and it was done fairly well within the twelve episode count. Could it have been paced better? Sure, but pacing’s not necessarily the problem here. The problem could be in the animation itself – it’s a little outdated and it’s very awkward in some areas.<br />
<br />
There is quite a bit of slapstick but the humor is decently timed and done well enough to get some laughs. It’s a bit more balanced in this instance but there were moments where it could have been cut out entirely.<br />
<br />
The music for the anime is fine although sometimes it felt really out of place for the ending song to come on (and it’s a bit annoying at times) after a rather serious moment. There are violins and it is a bit distracting but other than that, it’s nothing to really talk about. The music’s there but it does its job.<br />
<br />
It’s also very colorful and aesthetically pleasing, although the art for the girls’ eyes could have been toned down a bit. It would have worked better not to be too cutesy or to try to emulate the visual novel’s original style.  There’s a lot of star imagery but it’s so pretty. It’s really gorgeous but the animation could have been a bit better.<br />
<br />
As for the series in its entirety, if someone wanted something that focused more on the romance than the magical girl aspect (but wouldn’t mind it either way), this would be a good series to watch. It does drag a little bit in the beginning but once Prima Asparas shows up, it picks up its pace.<br />

    nanatsuiro drops is a great anime for love.In my life so far watching all romance anime,i am very sure that nanatsuiro drops is the best among all i hav watched so far.First love that encompasses you.Tsuwabuki Masaharu is just a normal student,not very social.One day he meets a new student named Akihime Sumomo and Sumomo&#039;s best frined Nadeshiko Yaeno.He turned into a doll by accidentally bumping into a servant of Nona Yuiki from figurae.The only way for Tsuwabuki Masaharu to turn back to normal is by collecting 7 stardrops with the help of the chosen girl that the teacher told him and the girl was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19580">
        Sumomo.Tsuwabuki think Sumomo was a shy and quiet girl but when he become a doll and was with her, he found out slowly that Sumomo was actually more than just that.He also suddenly started falling in love wit her as well.This anime shows about first love and the main characters,Tsuwabuki Masaharu and Akihime Sumomo become a couple and they faced many obstacles to overcome for their love.They both stood strong and hang on to their love.Nanatsuiro drops is a very warmful and touching love story and it caught my attention.Their love is pure and innocent.To my opinion,i believe that nanatsuiro drops is defenitely best love anime for me.I was so touch and i cry so hard watching the anime.Especiallly the final episode ^^,when Tsuwabuki Masaharu remember Sumomo and went to her at once.He kept his promise that he will love Sumomo once again even when he forget everything.I was crying so hard and it really touch my heart.I am glad that they two got back together ^^.I just love this anime so much and if possible if they make a season 2.....................i would be overjoyed.To me,Nanatsuiro drops taught me that love does not need a reason and it doesnt matter who said love is ridiculous.When you truly love that person,you will realize what it means to love.It will lovely dovey and happy to be with the one you loved at  but there will moment of pains and sadness and even obstacles.But no matter what,i will be with the  person i love and stay together even if everything in my life go wrong.I believe that love is something amazing and mysterious as we dont really know it ourself but it gave me meaning to my life and i believe in that love.I think i went off track wit my opinion..............i love this anime and the both main characther Haru and Sumomo so much until i don have any way to express my feelings for this outstanding anime.I will never forget this anime as well as  sumomo and haru as they love each other.

    I&#039;ll start of by stating that the series is based on an eroge, that alone should&#039;ve prepared me for what I saw, and in some ways it did, however, being the bastard that I truly am, I still feel the urge to lunge at this show with the critic&#039;s lumber axe of death and despair.<br />
<br />
Going over everything that was bad about this show would surely take up alot of space, not to mention leave a bitter taste in your mouth and making you believe I&#039;ve got nothing better to do than complain, which is sadly true... Anyway! The show is pretty much your average lovey-dove

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1820">
        magical girl high school comedy-romance, filled with clich&amp;eacute; characters, situations and dialogue and/or actions. Basically our heroine is a petit, flat-chested but-oh-so-cute shy and kindhearted person. Our hero is a glasses-wearing, somewhat buff and well-sculpted, bad haircut, anti-social douchebag who seems to have severe issues with his parents considering the fact that you never actually get to see them even once. The plot then? Nothing I&#039;ll even waste time on telling you, you can pretty much guess what it&#039;s about from the title anyway. The plotline is really unoriginal and you can guess the outcome of nearly every episode, not to mention the music constantly reminding us of what mood we should be in. Also, the animators seemed lazy and though it&#039;s common I suppose it still bugs me whenever I see the same lazy animation-clip re-used over and over. The show&#039;s sweet and cute and has most of the time a happy feeling about it. There&#039;s a lot more I could whine about but by now you&#039;ve probably lost interest anyway, so I&#039;ll move on.<br />
<br />
The good things about this show is, despite it&#039;s unoriginality it still kept me watching. This might be because I got to see a living sheep-plushie have a bath in the all-girls&#039; bath at some summer camp, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s not all, or else I feel sorry for myself. It&#039;s got some fun moments and even though I&#039;ve seen most, well all, of the jokes before, I still can&#039;t help myself to cracking a smile and laughing at some of them. The show&#039;s sweet and cute and has most of the time a happy feeling about it, sensitive types might find the sad moments sad too I suppose.<br />
<br />
Music and sound were, as usual, good and all but nothing that was exceptional or will make you line up or order the Original Soundtrack or Drama CD from Japan.<br />
<br />
Summarisation, already here? Who cares, you&#039;ve stopped reading anyway! It&#039;s an unoriginal, clich&amp;eacute;-filled, predictable and happy love-story which actually reminds you of most Hollywood-made films. It&#039;s not bad, some jokes are fun and what not, but it&#039;s nothing new or exciting really and most viewers will probably yawn or sigh about as often as they&#039;ll laugh and smile or cry, well, if you cry when watching this then you&#039;re a complete wuss and I&#039;ll hunt you down with a lawnmower!<br />
<br />
... Seriously, if you get teary-eyes from this I&#039;ll come around and smack you with a rolled up newspaper!

    An anime which will give you the feeling of watching something cute and sweet.<br />
<br />
Story [8/10]: The story had a typical but good plot. There are basically two worlds a magical world called Figurare and a Human world  Retroscena. A contest between two prime magical institutes from Figurare is conducted every year, where an able contestant from each (they are called Stellar Spinners in the shows) is selected to collect seven of the many star drops that fall out into Retroscena. The female protagonist, Sumomo, is somehow involved in this contest. Her opponent is Aspalas from Figurare. The story chronicles the contests between both the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review55109">
        Spinners in their quest to collect 7 star drops. Now where does the male protagonist fit into all this. Well as the synopsis says he accidentally turns into a stuffed sheep (and a very cute one too) in the mix up. His teacher explains the situation to both and Sumomo who doesnt know the identity of this stuffed sheep decides to help him. Now to turn him back to normal 7 star drops need to be collected which can then be used as a medicine to wash off all magical transformations. Thus starts the journey of Sumomo and Tsuwabuki as the stuffed sheep to collecting the 7 star drops while also contesting with aspalas. <br />
<br />
Though there are quiet a few scenes shown of Sumomo and Aspalas trying to catch the star drops they are not well executed. Their actions are not swift nor are the spells. From where are how the spells occur is never once explained. Magical recipes suddenly pop out for Sumomo during their contests though she&#039;s never studied magic before. A major disappointment in this department considering the fact that this story is supposed to be of Magic genre.<br />
<br />
The other part of the story about feelings slowly developing between Sumomo and Tsuwabuki are nicely done though. Not exaggerated or dramatic. But shy and cute. Loved watching them and I am pretty sure all of you who like to watch a slow and shy romance between a couple will definitely enjoy this.<br />
<br />
Animation [5/10]: Animation lacks the swiftness required during the contest scenes between Sumomo and Aspalas. Their movements at times are awkward. Other than that its okay.<br />
<br />
Art [9/10]: Liked the way the characters were drawn. Really cute. Landscapes are beautiful.<br />
<br />
Sound [8/10]: The Opening song is catchy. Background music in the series is good. Voice actors have done their parts well.<br />
<br />
Character [5/10]: The most noticeable of the characters were Tsuwabuki&#039;s friends. Though he is extremely less talkative and does not mix up too much with others in his class his classmates are his good friends who always try to bring him in their social circle. Yaeno, Sumomo&#039;s childhood and best friend is a good supporting character. But in terms of characters development you wont see too many changes in other characters except for Tsuwabuki and Sumomo. However, atleast no one&#039;s annoying.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [7/10]: I loved seeing the awkward romance develop between the main protagonists during the show. Loved seeing the cute sheep form of Tsuwabuki too. But apart from that the story overall is very weak. The plot had potential and could have been executed better by showing some details of the magical spells or some history of the contests, why the star drops fall and why only on the human world and not the magic world, etc. So all in all if you have much free time on your hands then maybe its okay to watch it once.

    Yay, this is my very first review i&#039;ve ever write! (And sorry if this sucks).<br />
<br />
Story : This anime is not your typical mahou-shoujo genre, Nanatsuiro Drops is more focused to the romance side than the magical side.<br />
<br />
Art : I really loved the art, its so cute and colorful.<br />
<br />
Sound : The OP of this anime is really standard.<br />
<br />
Character : The character design of this anime is really cute, especially Sumomo, but she cried too much and it annoys me when i watch it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : i really enjoyed this anime very much even though im a boy. I know this anime is targeted for a teenage girl

          <span style="display: none;" id="review32893">
        but i still watched it.<br />
<br />
Overall : This anime is very recommended for those who like a cute, lovely, and heart-warming romance story.<br />
<br />
&#039;&#039;First love that encompasses you&#039;&#039; really encompasses me. <br />
<br />
Total Score : 9/10

    At first I only saw pictures of the main character, thinking she was really cute. I never knew it was an anime so it was quite a surprise when I found out the title of it after about a year.<br />
It is a magical girl/shoujo anime so it was a bit predictable, but I don&#039;t mind that, as long as it had the sweet part of romance and since it did, I adored it.<br />
The art was extremely cute which was what drew my attention at first. I found that the story was sweet and amusing. I like how the romance between the two characters (Sumomo+Masaharu) wasn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review33958">
        so rushed and that there were episodes where we see their romantic moments. A lovely combination.<br />
I thought that the actual main character of the story was quite irritating at the beginning because she would always cry over little things, but as the story progressed, it lessened and she became stronger. The small little stuffed animal thing was quite unoriginal. Most magical girl series usually have a small companion like in Shugo Chara, Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne and Cardcaptor Sakura. The only difference here was that Masaharu would change forms during the night and stay human in the day. Also the twist where he would stay human in a night of a new moon.<br />
Overall, I really loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone who&#039;s into things with magic and romance ;) plus the fact that the ending was quite predictable but bitter-sweet &gt;.

    I have never really been a fan of the over-used-genre of the &quot;magical girl,&quot; but I had read that this series seems to take you by surprise and allows you to see unexpected side to the genre. So i decided to give it a shot, and here I am writing a review on it.<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story was pretty generic, the whole &quot;having to collect an object” (in this case Star Drops) to save someone or something. Even though this anime kept to that, I kept wanting more and more because in its own way, Nanatsuiro Drops kept a fresh view on the magical girl cliché

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99409">
        and managed to turn it into its own story. The romance was pretty pure and light-hearted which melded well with the story.<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The art was pretty well done, the magic was quite beautiful and the character and background surroundings were pretty well constructed.<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
There’s not much to complain about with sound and the music played fit the anime well. Although the music really wasn’t an major detail in this anime, it did help bring out emotions and added to the overall feeling Nanatsuiro Drops emitted.<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
While the characters did lack some background details, they still held their ground. I enjoyed the characters in this anime because their personalities shined through and overall added to Nanatsuiro Drops story.<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
I really enjoyed Nanatsuiro Drops, and would give a thumbs up to any romance anime lovers out there that are looking for a sweet and light-hearted romance that will keep you saying “awe” until the very moment it ends.<br />
<br />

    Nanatsuiro Drops is a tale of love at first sight between the main characters sumomo and haru.The difference is that this falls under the magical girl genre so expect there to be magic invovled and there you have it, a unique story of love thats will melt your heart.<br />
<br />
The story was unique in that while it is a typical love story with quite predictable theme of love so do expect it to be a bit cliche at points, however, the magic theme totally warps an ordinary story into one filled with twists(especially towards the end, there are more twists). However, the story is obviously one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7975">
        of pure fantasy and lacks realism in its content, it is very idealistic, so for those who cannot stand a story that differs from the harshness of reality i suggest you don&#039;t watch this. This show may also be seen as a bit childish to some, but i feel that its just because of the happy endings and stuff. Also unlike other magical girl animes, there isn&#039;t a real enemy in the show and not much fighting invovled so if you&#039;re looking for action this is definitely not for you. As mentioned just now, there isn&#039;t much fighting, this is because the main genre in this anime is actually romance and magical girl is a secondary genre. The genres this anime would fall under are manily romance, magical girl and perhaps drama(not so much of it though), oh and school of course. <br />
<br />
The art isquite good and it suits such a warm hearted and touching story. The colours are also quite important and have been used well to bring forth the atmosphere. The artist was also very good at portraying sceneries which is a key factor in this anime.<br />
<br />
The sound was excellent, not because i loved it(If i did then it would have gotten 10 ...perhaps..), but because of the excellent execution of the inserts(insert songs) throughout the story, i really brought out the atmosphere and helped to invoke deep feelings that would resonate throughout your body. The Op and ED songs were also suited in their meaning through the lyrics though not so much to my taste. This is probably one of the better animes i have seen using sound.<br />
<br />
The characters are of course another good point in the show. While there is a lack of focus on the supporting characters, the main characters are given ample show time and this helps bring out the romance and meaning in the show which is depicted through them.owever, i felt that the characters though lacking a bit in depth were still able to draw the attention of the viewer.<br />
<br />
I actually enjoyed this anime a lot, because being a romance and drama fan i like this kind of show though i was not so hopeful for the magical girl genre. The supporting characters helped to bring out the comic relief in this anime so the characters were still used quite adequately and the cute animations and jokes(not too lame) helped to make the show more enjoyable.While this show was a fairly lighthearted show, the twists towards the end still managed to capture the audience attention and create an atmosphere of suspense in which you are eager to know what happens next.(though the beginning does not have so much suspense...so you might have to endure a little at the start before it gets more interesting.)<br />
<br />
Overall, For such a short anime, i think that it does quite well in all areas of the show though lacking in some areas, which could only be improvd through a longer time span(e.g. depth of character). Besides that i would actually give between an 8 and 9, truly on eof the better animes i have seen in a while. So if you are looking for a touching, heart-warming story along a fantasy setting then give this anime a try.
