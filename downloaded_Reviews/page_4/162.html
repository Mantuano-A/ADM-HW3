    Every season there is one entry the anime community overhypes beyond belief and this time it&#039;s Kaguya sama.<br />
<br />
Story? There’s no story beyond two teen high schoolers failed love attempts at getting the other person to confess. Fans have dubbed Kaguya sama as the &quot;Death Note of romance&quot;, which is laughable because the mind games here are pretentious, basic tactics. <br />
<br />
The comedy is hit or miss most of the time, with the odd joke being able to crack a smile from me. The jokes and gags are repetitive and become stale e.g. the skit where the President and Kaguya gave love advice dragged on too long.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304925">
        The episode about the wiener joke (no, I’m not kidding) was so childish.<br />
<br />
The characters are a bunch of troupes who receive no character development: Kaguya is a rich, childish, pampered tsundere with barely any endearing qualities. Chika is the cute ditsy airhead, Ishigami is the depressed emo okatu that fans relate to calling him &quot;our guy&quot;. He&#039;s easily the worst character because of how one dimensional he is and all his jokes being so predictable e.g. &quot;oh no, Kaguya is going to kill me! I&#039;m going home President!&quot;. The president is the hardworking and studious guy. He’s the best of the main cast in my opinion. He&#039;s the most interesting, relatable and got varied comedy. <br />
<br />
The main problem with this show is the narration. The narrator might as well be his own character with how overused it is, to the point it becomes overbearing and annoying. The writer clearly didn&#039;t grasp the concept of &quot;show, don&#039;t tell&quot; because i don&#039;t want to be told about the characters and their thought process like they’re puppets. I don’t know why the narrator is keeping score of their matches because it ultimately amounts to nothing and we get the same rinse-repeat scenario next episode. He’s often mentioning stuff that’s obvious on screen with info dumps, which is jarring because it comes across as if the viewer is too stupid to think for themselves.<br />
<br />
I’ll give it to A1, the animation is great, the osts are good and the stylistic presentation is visually impressive enough for you to overlook most scenes taking place in one location. The opening visuals are creative, however the opening song is cheesy and the ending is forgettable.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kaguya sama is a fun rom-com, but it&#039;s cliche and filled with troupes that would otherwise be criticised in other shows. The dynamic between the two leads doesn’t change as they are no closer to confessing to each other than they were at beginning. It&#039;s baffling to see so many positive reviews and the amount of praise it’s received when it lacks substance and does nothing special compared to other rom-coms.

    Confessing love to someone is one of the most intimidating challenges we face in our lives. <br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama: Love is War takes this relatable fear to the extreme. This anime isn&#039;t your average rom-com; it&#039;s a fight to the death between two stubborn geniuses in a battle of who will confess first. Kaguya Shinomiya is the wealthy heir to a corporate enterprise, a prodigy of course, but sheltered, with far more pride than common sense. Her adversary, Miyuki Shirogane, comes from a much more humble background, a workaholic to reach the top of his class, but unfortunately, he has little experience with anything else. Despite wildly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305091">
        different upbringings, they share many things in common; stubbornness, unrivalled intelligence, egos more inflated than two hot air balloons, and they&#039;re both hopelessly in love.<br />
<br />
Rather than merely confessing, they use their intellect for schemes to make the other confess their love first. Fear rejection is too much for their overly inflated egos to handle—this makes their attempts to trick each other over-the-top and hilarious. Still, the underlying motivations of their outrageous scheming are heartfelt. It&#039;s always evident that they&#039;re in love. Whenever they come close to confessing, they immediately fall deep into their egotistical personas and shrug it off. <br />
<br />
Truthfully, I should hate Kaguya-sama. I prefer romances that focus on development and believable relationships—rather than awkward interactions until they finally confess in the final episode. Kaguya-sama&#039;s main appeal is cringe-worthy teasing, and it&#039;s abundantly clear we won&#039;t get a confession anytime soon. Albeit with the stakes raised so high that its psychological warfare is comparable to Death Note. You may think a premise as simple as this would grow tiresome. Still, it continues to raise the stakes. The directing is phenomenal. People often complain that nothing changes through the series—but they&#039;re overlooking details. The relationship gradually progresses, and each chapter has permanence. The student council room changes, past conversations are referenced all the time, and their attitudes change. Kaguya and Shirogane start as very cold, keeping conversation to a minimum, then they become more open with their personal lives. Of course, they retain their professionalism. Another complaint is that the jokes are repetitive; this isn&#039;t entirely offbase. As the show progresses, each characters&#039; sense of humor changes. They begin to understand each other more; as such, their banter becomes more personal. <br />
<br />
Each character fulfills a distinct comedic role. Shirogane, the student council president, and Kaguya, his vice, both at the top of their class, are always the center of their school&#039;s attention. They&#039;re geniuses but also crazy in love with each other. The supporting cast and even the narrator add so much more to the comedy. They all have fantastic chemistry with one another. Even the smallest mannerisms and reactions put you into the character&#039;s mind, conveyed through close-ups and internal monologues—this clues us in on how each of them feels, from a wild comedic display to a subtle emotional response.<br />
<br />
Chika, the student council secretary, is the embodiment of chaos and the straight man in the comedy routine. She unknowingly intervenes in the intense battles between Kaguya and Shirogane to hilarious effect. Although she acts airheaded, she&#039;s intelligent, talented, and has more life experience than both of the leads combined. Then there&#039;s the always anxious student council treasurer, Ishigami, who makes a late appearance in the show. He&#039;s likable for his long-running gags and banter with Kaguya. We often see Kaguya and Miyuki&#039;s nefarious strategizing from the side characters&#039; perspective, revealing how ridiculous they both look. It gives the show a welcoming sense of self-awareness. <br />
<br />
Every joke lands with a powerful impact because of the audiovisual feedback. Every sound effect is pitch-perfect. The melodic orchestral music constantly changes to complement wild tone shifts; it&#039;s nothing short of brilliant. The opening credits beautifully showcase the cast and the exaggerated mind games with an aesthetic reminiscent of studio Shaft. The theme song is so damn good; it is unlike anything else in anime nowadays. The third episode&#039;s notable ending credits are impressive, too. Chika&#039;s dance was rotoscoped with expert detail rarely seen in big-budget productions. Talent like this is hard to come by. The artist, Nagisa Sugao, must have days animating that one-and-a-half minutes of intricate animation. She not only came up with the dance herself; she performed it to get replicated with animation. If that&#039;s not the ideal blend of talent and passion, I don&#039;t know what is.<br />
<br />
What elevates Kaguya-sama&#039;s great comedy material far above any other rom-com is the exceptional directing from Shinichi Omata, among other industry experts. Known for his work on Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, he brings brilliant storyboards, a considerate eye for framing, dynamic direction, and creative budget distribution that takes what could have been an average adaptation to the best this season has to offer. This anime&#039;s excellence is thanks to perfect production management. Even with as little animation as this show has, there is always something moving onscreen. If a shot lingers, it&#039;s to highlight emotions without any dialogue, like the moment Kaguya admired her nail polish on the way to the club. It&#039;s brief, but it tells us exactly what she&#039;s thinking. <br />
<br />
Scenes blend into each other seamlessly. Objects fade into one another—and the transitions never break the 180-degree film rule. I counted more than a dozen match cuts in a single episode; The level of detail put into storyboarding each cut is impressive. I have nothing but admiration for the director. Background art transforms to reflect the character&#039;s inner monologue&#039;s mood, indicating how they overthink even the simplest of exchanges. The breathtaking animation only gets used to highlight pivotal moments, such as when Kaguya and Miyuki come close to kissing. Emotional character-development moments are highly memorable because of this extra attention to detail. <br />
<br />
Omata employs a frenetic style to emphasize punchlines and give importance to every bit of dialogue. Reality occasionally bends to create incredible and abstract visuals, which makes potentially mundane punchlines incredibly intense. These moments reflect just how exaggerated the crazed characters perceive their mind games to be. On the far end, the show straddles the line between slapstick comedy and an all-out thriller with static lines overlaying close-ups as a character verges closer to defeat in a battle; this is what makes Kaguya-sama so funny. Kaguya and Miyuki have astronomical IQs, but they use their intelligence to do the most idiotic things because they&#039;re afraid of having their hearts broken. It&#039;s so painfully relatable. The mind games they get lost in are entertaining, but they&#039;re so misguided in their approach to love that even their failures are hilarious to watch. They&#039;re both walking catastrophes. Thankfully the show acknowledges this and pokes fun at them through irony and sarcastic supporting characters. Its visual excitement, music, and wildly contrasting tones craft a dynamic comedic experience. <br />
<br />
Confessing your love to someone is terrifying. Growing up is an even more formidable challenge. Kaguya and Miyuki are slowly but surely navigating through their complicated emotions. Masterfully timed jokes, expert directing, and relatable characters—this show has it all. No matter if you love or hate anime romcoms, this takes the standard genre tropes and subverts them in new and exciting ways. Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an outstanding series that anyone can walk away from wholeheartedly adoring.

    To describe Kaguya-sama: Love is War as a battlefield of love, between two prideful geniuses, who see confessing as a sign of “weakness” is well—sort of misleading.<br />
<br />
Not because these type of scenarios don’t happen throughout the show, but more so because I’m not entirely sure that it is accurate to describe the characters as “prideful” or even “geniuses”; and that might be the biggest issue the show has.<br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama begins in a very direct way; the whole idea of the show, everything about Miyuki and Kaguya, and their relationship is thrown at us through a narrator. There is no build up of their relationship, we are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304854">
        told they are in love and we are immediately expected to care. As a result, I found it difficult to ever form a sort of solid connection with the characters, to ‘root’ for their romance, to think their ridiculous antics were always funny. Miyuki and Kaguya have little chemistry. It feels like I am missing something. With more care given to the characters, this show really could have been something special.<br />
<br />
I can imagine this could have been salvaged, if the characters proved themselves so charismatic and fun that they would eventually become completely endearing. But the characters never really had a consistent personality. Because let&#039;s be honest, Miyuki and Kaguya are not always ‘prideful’. The are constantly shown as vulnerable, embarrassed, and shy. Highlighting those parts about them were easily the worst bits of the show. When they were smart, cunning, devious, it lead to the best and most hilarious moments. The author probably did this to make them more relatable and cute, but I ultimately think it negatively impacted the show. Some of the situations Miyuki and Kaguya go through are so trivial and childish that only sheer ridiculousness of their characters could have made it genuinely hilarious. When we know that the basis of their resistance to being open to one another is rooted more in shyness than pride, it makes the situations come off as more silly than potentially hilarious. It should have gone all in on making them scheming egomaniacs, for the sake of the humour.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes the show did have moments where the characters acted the way I hoped they would—and it was funny. Various moments of the show proves itself as creative, enjoyable, and worthy. Chika and Ishigami served as good side characters, although it may have been a little too obvious that sometimes they were just there to steer the direction of the joke. The art style was bold and outwards. Over time the show starts to get a bit more ‘normal’ looking, but I do appreciate shows taking a step outwards to make it more memorable. <br />
<br />
Many times I was left feeling like some potential was being wasted. The show does stick to a formulaic way of having a ‘winner/loser’ in every bit, which didn’t always work. Sometimes it seems like the direction of the joke was radically shifted for no other reason than to just create a winner or a loser. I never found the narrator useful, and at worst he was just annoying. The show should have been more free, less confined to one particular style. Often it came off as settling.<br />
<br />
The most disappointing thing about the show is how good it could have been.<br />

    Considering the circumstances that have lead us to these conditions, I conclude the state we&#039;re currently facing is refreshingly cuddly in a soothing manner. <br />
<br />
I.e. How cute.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really like A-1, but this time they are doing pretty darn impressive job. Even the character design which A-1 fucks up approximately 100% of the time is quality here. Unbelievable. Sure the stares and GAZES could deliver more, and the how cute moments can only be so cute, but otherwise this is a ridiculously high quality adaptation which success was unpredictable. <br />
<br />
The first and last thing that stands out here is the directing. Those who have seen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300680">
        basically any anime at all will immediately recognize that this style is close to SHAFT&#039;s Shinbou Akiyuki, who is known as the nro. 1 anime director in the world pretty much. The director of Kaguya seems to be his old underling/coworker and, needless to say, he has learnt a great deal from the master himself. However -- unlike Tomohiro, who is the underling of the other big anime director (2nd biggest if you will), Ikuhara Kunihiko -- Kaguya&#039;s directing is much closer to its director&#039;s very own innovation, and to say that this is just a copy-paste would be a blind insult. This man has vision and style and doesn&#039;t seem to be afraid of anything. This is creativity and detail at its finest. It&#039;s rare to see modern anime even try and even more so: to success at anything new, but what our director, Shinichi Omata is doing here is nothing less than impressive. It&#039;s damn fresh to be accurate. Fully approved. <br />
<br />
Now that this nerd stuff out of the way, the content:<br />
<br />
&#039;Love is War&#039; is a rom-com series aimed for mature audience. It centers around 2 main leads and few other leads who are kinda as important as the other two but also practically in the side roles. Our main &#039;couple&#039; are Shirogane and Kaguya who have made the concept of &#039;love&#039; their battlefield. In this battle they are quite literally trying to outwit each others with the power of psychology, logic and pure rhetoric. Why do this, then? Because they both share this fundamental idea that love is weakness of the mind and confessing it an act so against ones pride that doing so makes them.. losers. So, what they are doing instead is try and make the other one confess first. Hence the battlefield. <br />
<br />
The series heavily relies on both: interactions between characters and silent monologue that plays inside the heads of our different POV&#039;s. The catch being how different the characters are inside their own head and how they appear to others in real life. They have lots of personality and can show different sides of it. Perhaps my favorite part of all of it are the &quot;war planning&quot; and also how overly dramatic Kaguya often is. To say few words about the other cast members, Fujiwara is criminally cute and the rest are pretty much weirdos. <br />
<br />
There is one entity in the series that is highly important to the overall execution and that&#039;s the narrator. He appears to add lots of missing links and initial reasoning for the characters&#039; thoughts, actions, and real purpose among other things. It balances out the comedy and &quot;plot side&quot; of the series as well as simply makes the overall narrative work/more solid.<br />
<br />
As of currently, I&#039;m extremely happy with this show. There are no major issues, only few small things that are questionable but also necessary to make the series&#039; core idea hold water. As far as rom-coms go, this is already among the better things anime has to offer. Also +1 for Fujwara&#039;s dance scene which animation budget is higher than the entire season of Date A Live III&#039;s cashmoney.

    Almost every time someone talks to me about a romantic comedy, they&#039;d would mention how well the romance is delivered. Then along came this show called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that goes beyond than just being a romantic comedy. In a landscape dominated by recent isekai shows, there’s a need for fresh air. Kaguya-sama managed be just that. <br />
<br />
Aka Akasaka is somewhat of a new author in the manga world. Prior to this series, their only work I was familiar with is Sayonara Piano Sonata. When Kaguya-sama began serializing, I knew there was something special about this series with the way it introduced its story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304850">
        and characters. Do note that the anime adapts chapters not in a chronological order but takes them to make the overall tone of the show flow better. Every episode contains at least 3 segments from certain chapters. There’s also some that are structured with continued storytelling but nothing too complex. With that being said, I think it’s important to realize what this show really is.<br />
<br />
First off, I would say that while this anime contains rom-com tropes, there’s also an insightful amount of dialogues that breaks from its traditional norms. Some will easily notice the mind games and dialogue wars between our two main protagonists – vice president Kaguya Shinomiya and President Miyuki Shirogane. Both are part of the prestigious school in Japan known as Shuchi’in Academy. While the two obviously develop feelings for each other, the show pits them into endless series of love battles. Their pride is on the line and neither are willing to confess their love. The English title also translates to “Kaguya Wants to be Confessed” so fresh anime viewers may wonder who will really be the one confessing in the end. That’s where the juicy part of the show comes in. You see, every episode contains segments about romance along with the constant mental battles between our two protagonists. From the very first episode, we see how much both characters value their pride. Their status at school are role models that everyone looks up to for their intelligence, looks, and position. In other words, Kaguya and Shirogane stands at the top of the mountain at Shuchi’in Academy and their only opponents are each other. Or is it? Because the more I watched this show, the more I realized the length both characters go to try to get the others to confess. This results in hilarious segments that drives the main plot. While both characters lack experience with love, they have many talent in other fields such as academics. In essence, the show manages to produce an immense amount of humor with the love war concept. <br />
<br />
Taking a look at each character on an individual level, Kaguya and Shirogane are actually quite normal despite being larger than life characters. However, the show portrays Kaguya as a girl who is obsessed with Shirogane. The extent of her mind games sometimes goes to extreme lengths such as trying to prevent Shirogane from leaving school, planting movie tickets, or even as something silly as fighting over a piece of cake. The result of these scenarios often end up with consequences or misunderstanding. This is where the show’s absurdity and humor comes in. Because of how hard both characters try to defend their own pride, they create a fake persona of themselves to each other. Nonetheless, it seems at times, Kaguya does have genuine feelings for Shirogane such as when she gets jealous of him interacting with Chika.<br />
<br />
Ah yes, Chika Fujiwara. If there’s anyone in this show that could set off more reactions, it’s her. She’s like the catalyst for Kaguya’s mood swings in particular when interacting with Shirogane. Jealousy is easily shown on Kaguya’s face in early episodes and that’s thanks to her personality. In general, Chika is known to be disruptive to the school council. Whether she’s conscious about it or not, she often sets off absurd moments in the show because of her unpredictability. However, I think Chika’s presence in the show should be appreciated for exactly what she is. In fact, I categorize Chika as somewhat of anti-thesis of the main characters. She isn’t afraid to speak her mind and is very open about being herself. This is very different compared to Ai Hayasaka, Kaguya’s valet. Hayasaka takes on several personalities that can be hard to distinguish the real her. While being a supporting character, I find her role in the show important for being supportive of Kaguya. <br />
<br />
As with many rom-coms, it needs to have male characters that aren’t just alpha males like Shirogane. This is where Yu Ishigami comes in. Having an inferiority complex, he doesn’t have nearly as much as pride in himself as Shirogane. Unlike him, Ishigami isn’t a real genius but he tries hard in things that interests him. The more I watched his character interactions, the more I realized how real he is compared to the others. He can be rather relatable for his social status and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the anime needed someone like him too. That being said, outside of these characters, there’s only a small handful that gets spotlights such as Shirogane’s sister. There are occasional side characters that reinforces the themes of love in the show but these often don’t greatly influence the show’s plot. With everything being said, I think watching Kaguya-sama takes an open mind to accept what this show offers while also enjoying what you may not often find in rom-coms.<br />
<br />
One of the interesting things I noticed is the production staff involved in the show. It consists of ex-Shaft members such as Shinchi Omata and Kei Haneoka. Director Shinichi Omata manages to capture a unique theatric feeling with his clever approach. For those who are familiar with Shaft, it can at times feel similar in style with his craft. Many scenes in the show has a dynamic transition that is impactful ranging from a character expression to the clever timing of the dialogues. Indeed, a show like this needs careful timing to deliver its dialogues. Even a narrator is here to speak for its plot. The animation quality is also polished with stellar effort and manages to capture the magic of the manga. We’re so lucky to have this adaptation with a golden treatment to be honest. Oh and who can forget the theme songs for the show? The opening contains a spy espionage-theme that matches this show in perfect union. It also contains choreography that shows the mind game themes without holding back. Simply put, it’s mesmerizing. Similarly, the ED theme songs are decorated with colorful aesthetics. There’s even one particular episode that had Chika perform her own ED theme because that’s just how damn good this show is.<br />
<br />
I love the manga and the anime gave me a similar sensation. Sure, not all the chapters were adapted but that’s not the point at all. It managed to be rise above mediocrity of rom-coms by appealing to a variety of story gimmicks. The characters manages to deliver their lines like a theatric play filled with charisma and talent. While the story can feel repetitive at times, it’s thanks to the heartfilled humor that will always get you engaged. Kaguya-sama sets a gold standard for a romantic comedy that’s so much more than just confessing love.

    A masterpiece that evokes every emotion I want to feel from a Romantic comedy.<br />
President Miyuki and Vice President Kaguya are in love with each other, but both view themselves as the ultimate object of desire, and thus see no reason to confess, in fact when you are as perfect as they are shouldn’t it be the duty of other people to aspire towards you? However, this is quickly revealed to be a front used by two egotistical Teenagers who can’t quite work up the courage to ask out their crush. What follows from this is a sequence of over thought-out plans in order to force

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300691">
        the other to confess. The comedy in the series comes from its hyper-dramatization of the utterly mundane. Asking someone to the movies is a complex web of intrigue, a game of 20 questions is a western shoot-out, and cat ears are banned by the Geneva convention. But no matter how well-laid the plans of Miyuki and Kaguya, destroying them is but child’s play to their secretary, Chika. This show would be amazing even if it was just comedy, but underneath the absurdity is a sincerely heart-warming story of teenagers learning to move past their flaws, insecurities, and other problems. We are given enough reminders that beneath all these mind games between the two leads there is genuine and sincere emotions for the other. So even though they never confess outright significant progress is still made in the characters’ lives.<br />
<br />
A fast frenetic directing style gives the characters so much life even though all they are doing most of the time is thinking in a room. It’s not afraid to break away from reality constantly keep its visuals engaging, and the camera loves to spin, swing, and slide across the main set; Maneuvers made possible by some excellent use of CGI and compositing. Character expressions are exaggerated in creative ways, and the voice actors bring their A game to match the animation. Much like Jojo the color swims to match the mood of a scene, and combined with an eclectic collection of background music serves to set the tone perfectly for most scenes. Character movement is usually quite fluid. Aesthetically it knocks it out of the park. Not to say every frame is a masterpiece, as the cut corners are quickly discernible to a practiced eye, but the peaks far outnumber the troughs.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically fantastic and narrative-ly ingenious: A show people must at least try.<br />

    Disclaimer: This is a more critical view of Kaguya sama than something commented just on pure enjoyment overrall.<br />
Kaguya sama is one of the newest and most popular comedy animes in the current times, be it due to simple jokes being shared or the dance in the ending that literally everyone decided to talk about, however, the overall quality of the anime itself should&#039;nt be ignored because like everything else, it has it&#039;s flaws.<br />
First of all, the anime is extremely episodic almost to the point of being predictable, it sticks to it&#039;s formula and never decides to change or take absolute advantage of being formulaic which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300705">
        ends up in it being repetitive, still fun due to the visuals and somewhat great jokes every now and then but, critically speaking it&#039;s far from being as perfect as many reviews i&#039;ve seen here make it out to be.<br />
Also, the direction is overall pretty weak, it&#039;s an extremely visual style that reminds a bit of what studio shaft&#039;s directors tend to do but the way the director applied those tecniques makes it more something visually interesting that good unlike the huge majoritiy of the works by shaft.<br />
And Lastly, the characters themselves are pretty &quot;ok-ish&quot;, they sure are fun to watch but they lack some depth to them, even if you argumente that it&#039;s unnecessary for a comedy series to have a bit of complexity, Kaguya sama tries to actually be a romance at times to try going further into developing the relationship between the main cast so, if it&#039;s attempted by the author, even if weakly, automatically makes the argument invalid and compromises a bit more the anime.<br />
Well, concluding it all, Kaguya sama is a weak anime and far from being the best of the current season, however, it&#039;s a fun ride, not a perfect one and even less one that deserves a nines and tens but one that should be taken a look if you want just a pretty nice comedy.

    I must be to old to like this anime.<br />
<br />
There is no story, it`s all about 2 young students who are afraid to show their real feelings.<br />
And then it`s only short stories, 3 or 4 in 1 episode.<br />
<br />
It`s really boring, Chika is somewhat amusing although not really.<br />
Maybe if the characters would evolve, but they don`t.<br />
<br />
The main characters are showing bold and all knowing, but they are really as insecure as a little schoolgirl<br />
Maybe i have seen to many of this genre, but it just doesn`t interest me at all.<br />
Watch this if you like to see insecure students bumbling around, otherwise don`t waste your time on this<br />
<br />
perhaps

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301405">

    This is one of those special anime that perfectly represents why I’ve been sticking with anime for so long. Love is War exudes brilliance with every fiber of its being. It has so much going for it, and offers something that practically everyone can enjoy. In simpler terms, it’s just so damn good bruh! What, don’t believe me? pfft, how cute. Let me lecture you on why this anime is pure excellence. <br />
<br />
Psychological battles of wits have always excited me. It’s quite exhilarating to witness two characters going head to head against each other not physically, but mentally.  Anime RomComs with interesting and dynamic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304852">
        characters can always be a joy to watch as well, especially when they take an unconventional approach to the genre. Love is War is a crazy mix of both of these genres, almost like it’s the illegitimate love child of Death Note and Toradora. And let me tell you, this anime is super legit. <br />
<br />
It doesn’t take a love detective to figure out that overachieving student council protagonists Kaguya and Shirogane have a thing for each other. Yet they’re both so hilariously egotistical and out of touch with reality that they constantly attempt to coerce the other into making the first move, since in their minds, doing so would be a major sign of weakness. For the person who confesses first…*dramatic pause*…loses. Funnily enough, I believe that the person who takes the first step in starting a relationship is actually the stronger one, but that’s not how these two see it. Their relationship is portrayed brilliantly in the anime, and the amount of entertaining scenarios that these two find themselves in during each episode is just mind boggling. Plus the three major side characters, Chika, Ishigami, and Hayasaka, are all hilarious, and they simply further add to the greatness of the show. <br />
<br />
Love is War is one of those rare anime where it actually gets better and better in practically every regard after each passing episode. Seriously though, all concerns and doubts that I had about this show after watching the first episode were completely obliterated from existence as it went on. And then the anime decided to straight up surpass my expectations for it, it’s just that awesome. Of course, while many of the show’s successes are noticeably apparent, others require you to look a little deeper into the anime to discover. <br />
<br />
Something that I didn’t realize until the later portion of the anime was just how much Kaguya develops as a character. I was so focused on the comedy that I almost missed it, though her growth is pretty subtle. I discovered that Kaguya becomes significantly more expressive then she was in the earlier episodes, and seems to have really come out of her shell.  What I believe started as a mere fleeting interest in getting the highest ranked student at her academy to fall for her blossomed into a truly heartfelt love for the student council president. I won’t get into Kaguya’s backstory, but let’s just say that feelings and love are quite foreign to her. Yet through her many interactions with Shirogane, she starts to understand how to feel, and this causes her to both show and perceive real emotion. Yes, she was always a fun character from beginning to end. Yet while the initial battles Kaguya waged against Shirogane primarily focused on her amusing ability to plan her strategies incredibly far in advance, her only desire was to win and make Shirogane submit to her. However, with her later battles, they just felt more genuine, like she was legitimately trying to make Shirogane confess to her because she actually loves the guy and is just too awkward and nervous to make the first move herself. The fantastic visuals help to further emphasize this, as we constantly see her flailing about in embarrassment and being all blushy blushly when in the presence of Shirogane as she starts to spend a lot more time with him. Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but damn it, the author is a certified genius for writing Kaguya’s character in such a compelling way.<br />
<br />
It’s development like this that really gets me to appreciate both the character and their respective show. Yet although Kaguya is the protagonist, what probably ended up as the most popular thing about this anime was Chika. More specifically, her dance. <br />
<br />
The Chika dance sequence alone is enough to give this anime high marks in both the visual and sound departments. Her dance literally has the power to save anime AND cure crippling depression at the same time, it’s just that good. Now I’m not well versed in the mechanics of animation, but I do know that the style used to animate Chika’s dance is quite expensive, so major respect to the animators for putting so much effort into constructing such a special dance. A-1 probably had to steal the budgets from some of the other winter seasonals to pull this off, but it was totally worth it. Now I don’t want to overshadow the rest of the animation in Love is War by just talking about Chika’s dance, because the entire show is aesthetically charming and distinctive. <br />
<br />
Stylistically speaking, I noticed that this anime utilizes tons of unique visual techniques that really bring things to life and add even more layers to the anime. While the setting of the show predominately takes place in the same old student council room, every single scene is still unique and fresh thanks to the innovative visual effects used each episode. It’s kind of hard to explain it without actually showing the visuals, but if you watch the show, you’ll understand what I’m getting at. Though the greatest accomplishment in the animation department would have to be the character designs. Not only do they look great normally, but the characters are constantly animated in different styles that keep things fresh and further heighten the comedic value of the show. They’re drawn in such a variety of designs, from horror-esque to chibi-like. Each and every frame just seems to have been created with so much care. In an age where it feels like most animators just put the bare minimum into their shows, it’s refreshing to see an anime given so much attention to its visual quality and special effects. Props to A-1 Pictures.<br />
<br />
Voice acting is superb. I initially wasn’t certain how well Kaguya’s seiyuu would work when I first saw Kaguya’s character design, but I soon realized just how perfect a fit she is. She just breathes so much life into Kaguya, who is already a superior character. The rest of the voice actors do a phenomenal job as well, and their expert line deliveries further heighten the effectiveness of jokes. Also, the weird little noises that the girls, particularly Chika, occasionally make are just great. Like, how cute can they get? The theme songs are nice and the soundtrack does its job well.<br />
<br />
The cast of characters are truly the fuel that bring this anime to life. When the core cast is as small as it is in this anime, the likability of these individuals can really make or break the success of the show. For me, I ended up liking every single one of the characters. Like, a lot.<br />
<br />
So Kaguya is best girl for me, and if you dare disagree…then that’s okay too! I’ve already talked about some of the more prominent aspects of her character, but I’m not going to pass up an opportunity to further praise her. First of all, she’s absolutely adorable. Especially during the bed scene in episode 9, where all I could think was how cute can this girl possibly be? I love her color palette because red and black are obviously the best colors. Her awkwardness combined with her intellectual brilliance is incredibly fitting. What truly makes her shine though is her relationship with Shirogane. The two of them just complement each other so well. Shirogane himself is a workaholic, and I wish that I had half of his work ethic. Just half, since any more would probably cause me to keel over from exhaustion. Seriously though, with the way he works, I don’t know how this man manages to stay on his feet! Like Kaguya, his social ineptitude is matched only by his intelligence, and the combination just works. <br />
<br />
Chika is the most entertaining supporting character I’ve seen in a long time. I was trying to think of one of her finer moments to use as an example of why she’s so amusing, but then I realized that they’re all good. Love detective Chika. Volleyball coach Chika. Cheating at card games Chika. Ramen connoisseur Chika. The list goes on. Chika’s ditsy nature and complete obliviousness to her surroundings are incredibly charming. She just brings a sort of energy to the show that increases my power levels tenfold whenever she’s on screen. Ishigami is the fourth and final member of the student council we’re introduced to, and he’s like the most relatable dude ever. He really is our guy. I can connect with a lot of his monologues on a spiritual level, and his introduction into the show was when it really started to become something great in my opinion. The final character that I’d like to give a shoutout to is Hayasaka. She is Kaguya’s attendant, and her dedication to helping Kaguya get together with Shirogane is admirable. She literally gets them in the same bed together at one point, so good on you Hayasaka. <br />
<br />
To sum everything up, Love is War works because it’s actually funny. Like with every comedy anime I watch, I was worried that the jokes would eventually go stale and the show would get boring as it progressed. I can tell you with absolute certainty that this isn’t the case with Love is War. Each episode actually seemed to get even funnier than the last, and this ended up being one of those rare anime that actually got me to laugh out loud. Yes, comedy is subjective. But there’s such a diverse agglomeration of jokes to be found here that it just feels like this anime has something for everyone. The entertainment derived from watching something is, for me, the most important aspect of a show, and Love is War completely nails it in this regard.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a quality anime that I would wholeheartedly recommend watching for the comedy alone, not to mention the plethora of other great things that this show brings to the table. Love is War is not the anime we deserved, but the one we needed. Like, desperately. Hopefully future comedies, and all genres for that matter, will follow Love is War’s excellent example. And hey, a season 2 wouldn’t hurt as well. Let’s get it done A-1, cause I simply need MOAR!

    This is not good.<br />
<br />
The whole show got popular and keeps getting popular thanks to a meme of a dancing lady. A lot of people consider it the best comedy show they have seen, and a lot of people dislike the fact this is called a comedy anime.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m on par with the last example, this whole show is extremely repetitive and predictable, you can pretty much predict what&#039;s gonna happen in the next 10 minutes, without the help of any spoilers, most of the jokes and comedic parts are hardly funny or as you would like to call it &quot;sarcastic&quot;. It was a premise with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303342">
        name of something so intriguing as &quot;Psychological Comedy&quot; but ended up being your next Sword Art, it is almost childish to call this Psychological just because of camera angles, and because some characters &quot;threat&quot; each other with words when both of them don&#039;t even know the meaning of love.<br />
<br />
The whole direction of the series keeps going down with every episode and skit looking the same as before and the same as every other A-1 Pictures anime. Keeping the formula of generic episodic series.<br />
<br />
The characters are (as mentioned) like any other characters the studio has produced, even if they are not made by the same person, their personalities, traits and such are always the same, lacking depth and complexity in their development. <br />
<br />
The show itself started slow, and with forced comedy that barely made me smile, it is indeed a weak anime when it comes to this season. Would i recommend this? No. Would you enjoy it? Probably. Did I enjoy it? No.<br />
<br />

    “See, this show&#039;s what having a good director can do for your fuckin&#039; show. You can make A-1 Pictures look like a competent studio. That&#039;s fucked up!” -DEEsidia from REVEL HOUSE, 2019 <br />
<br />
Pride is cruel and ignorance is bliss, and when love is war, feelings are the casualties. Kaguya-sama is this concept taken to a hilarious extreme, with two teenage egotists trying to manipulate each other into confessing their feelings as every idea they ever had gets trampled on. This show thrives off its comedic timing, with tons of audiovisual flair, character chemistry, and wild ideas for our main leads to plan around and exploit.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304882">
        With A-1 being listed as the studio behind this, I’m sure some alarms were triggered, but thanks to Rakugo director Shinichi Omata, everything listed prior is utilized spectacularly.<br />
<br />
Shinichi Omata brings a ton of life to this anime with his stylistic flourishes. A lot of the time, backgrounds and camera movements are incredibly stylized, adding to scenes of characters overthinking things. Whenever a character starts freaking out or shouting in an over the top fashion, several grainy motion lines consume either the characters or the backgrounds. The ED themes have some creative visuals as well. These and more all add so much character to the visuals, which is a blessing since despite the fun character designs and facial expressions, the artwork dips a surprising amount early on, and the sparse CGI models can be pretty terrible. Thankfully, the visual inconsistencies and blemishes are so infrequent that the expressive visual flourishes and amazing shots more than make up for them.<br />
<br />
On top of the great visual comedy is the actual character comedy, relying on bombastic personalities and their chemistry with one another, including the narrator of the show, who provides a healthy dose of both on his own whilst poking fun of our main leads. Shirogane’s an over-the-top serious character, constantly shouting despite always maintaining a sense of authority, combining the general style of Gendo Ikari from Eva with the ridiculously dorky yet serious nature of someone like Yamamoto from Tylor or Sora from NGNL. It makes things all the funnier when he’s undermined by love interest Kaguya Shinomiya, who constantly wants to retain her air of refinement and superiority despite being a sheltered, jealous dork who gets flustered at the drop of a hat. However, the character that steals the show for me is Chika Fujiwara, the busty wildcard cloudcuckoolander --think Mayuri from Steins;Gate but probably evil-- who’s constantly making Kaguya jealous and single-handedly dismantling everyone around her and whatever they try to do. This doesn’t include the times when Chika has to teach Shirogane how to do things, which brings her immense pain. A close contender for best character is Ishigami, who appears halfway into the show, and is as paranoid and ridiculous as he is sensitive and adorable. It takes half the show to introduce him, but some of the show’s most gut-busting moments come from him, especially when he reaches critical sass levels. Lastly, there’s our helpful deadpan character in Kaguya’s maid, Ai Hayasaka, who has particularly great chemistry with Kaguya as she attempts to help her earn Shirogane’s heart. Somehow, she has the most surprises up her sleeves. The random tertiary characters are all entertaining as well, thanks to the comedic and sometimes emotionally resonant writing of a well-balanced and vibrant main and supporting cast. Each skit tells us something new about these characters. Combine that with their chemistry and the sheer number of skits, it leaves these characters feeling incredibly rich, on top of being varied and colorful. You can honestly make a case for any of the 5 major characters being the best, which is a great sign.<br />
<br />
Kei Haneoka’s music does a good job complimenting the show’s calculated absurdity. The OST often cycles between being as bombastic as the scenarios they support and being whimsical, meme tracks that play over sequences such as a comedic explanation of the game 20 Questions. The OP &quot;Love Dramatic feat. Rikka Ihara&quot; by Masayuki Suzuki is one of the standouts of the season, boasting a jazzy, almost James Bond-like feel with the sneaky and sometimes psychedelic visuals to match once the song reaches its chorus. It matches the personalities of the main duo quite well and how they treat these scenarios like mind games. Sadly, the EDs don’t live up outside of the visuals and the meme factor of Chika’s ED. That, however, is a small loss.<br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama is one of the funniest and most well-directed shows I have seen in a long time. This outrageous premise certainly won’t appeal to everyone, especially to those who hate the concept of two main characters pussyfooting around confessing to each other. However, the wonderful cast, humor, and visual direction more than make up for any possible annoyance that otherwise may have caused me. Nearly every skit and episode build upon the last. If you want your fix of romcoms or shows starring manipulative egotists, this is almost certainly the anime for you. It’ll probably stay in my holy trinity of comedy anime for quite some time.<br />

    “Wieners sliced to look like an octopus!  They really exist!  I want to try one…” — Kaguya Shinomiya<br />

“Ohh, gawd.  Did I accidentally stumble upon Shokushu Goukan….(again)?!” — Krunchyman<br />

Overt references to tentacle erotica aside, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an anime about two people — Kaguya and Miyuki — who secretly love each other, but are unwilling to confess their affections in fear that the other person will gain the upper hand.  This, invariably, commences a series of events in which Kaguya and Miyuki attempt to psychologically outmaneuver one another, generating a conglomerate of awkward/comedic circumstances.  Whether or not these ventures

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300685">
        result in genuine laughter is a matter of comedic taste, but it won’t stop me from telling you my thoughts on the matter.<br />
<br />
Love is War presents a situation that is all too common in preteen-to-teen years, that being: “I love you, but I’ll pretend otherwise.”  The school milieu, along with pent-up hormones, forces numerous young-adults to experience these contradictory feelings towards one another, resulting in numerous awkward/hilarious situations.  For Kaguya and Miyuki, these situations involve Death-Note-level internal monologues where they battle one another in a metaphorical game of cognitive love-chess.  It’s actually fairly entertaining (albeit in a foolish way — which is precisely the way I like it, uh huh huh).<br />
<br />
The best moment of the series, thus far, was when Kaguya (a sixteen year-old girl, mind you) thought that her “first time” was a reference to kissing, instead of sexual intercourse.  Her naive innocence propelled her to claim, “I did it to my newborn nephew,” which resulted in horrified looks from Chika and Miyuki; I was laughing my balls off!<br />
<br />
Love is War is not the type of series that will blow your socks off, yet its coquettish dynamic between Kaguya and Miyuki has a certain charm that is not easily consummated in the genre.  The jokes, themselves, are more miss than hit, but the ones that do hit are exceptionally hilarious.  The direction of the plot seems quite obvious (an eventual confession by either Kaguya or Miyuki, or both at the same time), but the journey towards their declaration of love is quite humorous, plus the ending dance by Chika is dope as f—k!

    I despise A-1 Pictures. They either make average shows out of good source material or make absolute trash. You can imagine my disappointment when I saw that a manga with a score of about 8.65 was given to A-1. And judging by that 10 in the top right corner, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I saw the first episode of this show.<br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama is the funniest anime I have seen since Tanaka-kun, which says a lot since the latter is my favorite comedy anime. The sheer ridiculousness of the plot is hilarious. Death Note-level mind games are woven into a story about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300718">
        two high schoolers who are pretty much too ashamed to ask each other out, and to top it all off, everything is over-dramatized.<br />
<br />
The one good thing about A-1 is that they get insane budgets for their anime. Every technical aspect without exception is wonderful. Perfect art, great OSTs, great VAs, one of the best OPs I&#039;ve ever heard, and that Chika dance ED from episode 3.<br />
<br />
Overall, Kaguya-sama is pure genius. An ingenious and novel plot, great characters, and a massive budget are apparently enough to create a masterpiece. Kaguya-sama is hilarious, heart-warming, and original, which is everything most romcoms are not.

    A random day back in December 2015 had me giving a chance to at that point very recent manga called Kaguya-sama after the cover grabbed my attention, not too many chapters after I already fell in love with it and it eventually became my favorite work ever and the one that I was waiting like crazy for an adaptation to happen, and when that time came… oh god, they couldn&#039;t have delivered harder!<br />
<br />
The main duo of this story are Kaguya and Miyuki, the two students at the top of a highly renowned academy and the two most lovable tsunderes out there, consistently trying to outplay

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304863">
        the other into confessing their love to hilarious results. These two characters come from very different perspectives (she is from a very rich and influential family with questionable raising standards and has been sheltered from the outside in the process, while he has to work part-time together with all the stuff he does to help his family, this man needs to sleep) and this is so, so nicely used for both comedic elements and also for the more dramatic parts that this work has, that give fantastic character development and make us understand and love them even more than before.<br />
<br />
Together with those two, the student council also has two more (and equally awesome) members that bring extra dynamics to the interactions and comedy. Chika is a completely chaotic element to the tactics of the main duo, with her personality completely clashing with all the strategies they might have prepared. Lastly, we have ourguy Ishigami, the man, the legend, this man is so lovable and the perfect mix of “dude, wtf” and “stop being relatable”, protect at all costs.<br />
<br />
A-1 Pictures is a studio that gets a lot of hate that I can&#039;t agree with at all, the way they work with different staffs leads to very different results, but any studio is pretty hit or miss anyways, and when this one goes all in very few deliver as hard, so I was very optimistic towards them getting this anime, and yet they surpassed my expectations, hard. The directing of the series is just fantastic, with so many great shots, camera movements, perfectly executed timing on the character reactions to add to the comedy, lots of extra details… just wow. <br />
<br />
Another thing I want to praise is the voice actors, who did such an outstanding work in the way that makes you think “man, they sure had fun recording this!” I have nothing but good things to say about them, and I especially want to mention Yutaka Aoyama, the narrator of the series (such a key element of Kaguya and he did it flawlessly, so many laughs!) and Aoi Koga, who I already had the fortune to hear about thanks to her secondary role in the also fantastic Aikatsu Stars, which made me see before this anime started that she was the perfect fit for Kaguya&#039;s character, who gives a hard work with her switches between absurdly adorable and quite terrifying due to her way to be and that she did so well.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so happy that this anime got the popularity it deserved (thanks Chika dance for helping with that) and I hope that this is just the first from a lot of seasons that this work needs so badly, I 100% recommend you to give this anime a chance if you haven&#039;t yet, you won&#039;t regret it!

    2 geniuses trying to feel superiority by making the other confess first! This has got to be one of the best scenarios ever!<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
Let&#039;s get this straight, I don&#039;t love the studio that makes this anime and feel as though their animation is solid but not great, however, holy shit! The visuals in this anime are so impressive, it reminds me of something Shaft would produce which I love, most people are going to be pleasantly surprised at how great the animation and the art in general is! Sound wise, I have 0 complaints! Voice acting is spot on with a very underrated funky OP and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300689">
        perfect ED for the anime. The sound gets an 8 and the art gets a 9!<br />
<br />
Plot/Characters:<br />
The show is episodic and within each episode, it&#039;s broken down into even smaller parts which makes for a non-stop funny entertaining anime that&#039;s consistently great throughout! My main concern with the plot is that it seems to start to get repetitive after a while but honestly I don&#039;t give a fuck due to how great EVERY episode is! Fucking hell... the best cast of characters this season easily! The main characters have amazing chemistry and juxtapose perfectly with the airhead secretary! This dynamic between the characters is perfect and sets up for a perfect balance of tense and hilarious sequences! The plot gets an 8 and the characters get a 10<br />
<br />
Overall: <br />
I don&#039;t have any major faults to talk about this anime! It&#039;s been a non-stop exciting, hilarious show fuelled by a fantastic cast and I hope that it&#039;s repetitiveness doesn&#039;t make it stale after it&#039;s completion! I&#039;m honestly blown away at how there isn&#039;t a single episode where I don&#039;t feel as though the 25 mins we&#039;re actually 5 mins! Each episode is so entertaining that I lose track of time; because of this it gets an enjoyment rating of 10 and an overall rating of 9!

    Kaguya-sama: Love is War <br />
<br />
As much as this show can be as stereotypical an anime can be, it wasn&#039;t a surprise to see the show using the same tropes used in the past, in these days finding out a new way to make a love comedy anime interesting is quite hard. So rather than focusing on changing the tropes, other aspects of the anime can be changed to make it alluring towards the viewer, and that&#039;s what this anime did. <br />
<br />
Rather than focusing on the plot of the story, since hardly there is really no plot, it&#039;s focused more on the antics,  plotting of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305112">
        the characters, to make the other one confess their love. The synergy between these characters is what separates this show towards all other love romantic comedies out there, all the characters are in a way, in correlation to, connected to each other to make out the perfect chemistry. The side characters are there to break the ice between the two tunnel visioned main characters whilst adding a sense of unpredictability between what can happen. <br />
<br />
Their problems isn&#039;t so special as much as they are quite pointless, stupid and illogical, mostly focusing a lot on the little things that doesn&#039;t necessarily move them forward to a better relationship, in this, they conduct such activities into a day to day basis, which leads them into questionable situations they put themselves through, with this style, it wasn&#039;t as so much serious but rather more of a casual, funny, watch. Whilst it is casual and funny, the anime still manages to be able to transfer into a comedic situation into a serious situation in a way that looked natural, therefore opened up a new path for more in-depth development towards the characters and the problem that they face. <br />
<br />
The voice actors have played a big role in bringing out the character&#039;s sense of personality, as well as the narrator playing a part in bringing out the show&#039;s tone and mood. The character&#039;s are easily likable and cute, with their set of unique personalities that defines them respectively and sets them apart. The soundtrack is nice as well. <br />
<br />
In conclusion Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a defining example of what love comedy shows should strive to be and what it can be. With it&#039;s allure of likable, funny, unique characters, and a little twist in the genre, it has proved itself to be a must-watch for everyone to at least try, and decide for yourself it&#039;s sense of worth. (How cute). <br />

    I’ve seen plenty of romantic comedy anime series that draw interest with their own sort of game, but never before have I seen such a series like this one strut their stuff and dance it out like this one.<br />
<br />
Adapted from a seinen manga series published by Viz Media and Shueisha, produced by A-1 Pictures, and directed by Mamoru Hatakeyama (the very same person who contributed to the likes of SHAFT shows like Madoka Magica and Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko), “Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War” is a rom-com show that seems to be aimed more for mature viewers due to its rather unique and twisted take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304874">
        on the generic tropes of most other shows in the same genre. Having heard good stuff about the manga source, but still being initially apprehensive due to my past experience with most rom-com shows, I headed into the show with midline expectations. What was bestowed before me was something so amazing that even what will be stated in this review probably won’t do enough justice to describe its value and complexity.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
Taking place in a typical-looking school setting of Shuchi’in Academy, Kaguya-Sama uses a semi-episodic format where each episode consists at least three segments, focusing on the two primary characters, Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, as well as the three other recurring support cast members with whom they’re heavily associated with. In almost every segment, Kaguya and Miyuki wind up in an epic battle of mind games and psychological warfare with the primary goal of trying to get the other side to confess their feelings. Instead of the usual tropes with most rom-coms where neither party takes the initiative due to both believing they’ll be rejected, Kaguya and Miyuki both refuse to make a move due to both being heavily convinced that the other DOES have romantic feelings and is on the verge of surrender or admittal of those feelings. This is because both sides believe that the concept of love is a sign of mental weakness and that a confession is equivalent to throwing aside their pride and making them essentially the losers. The ensuing mind games result in hilarious, bombastic, and overly dramatic moments of internal and interpersonal dialogue. From a personal standpoint, Kaguya and Miyuki’s clash of wits doesn’t just seem like a battlefield to me, but something along the lines of a crazy dance-off or truth-or-dare game, similar to what I’ve seen between the likes of Light Yagami and L in the immensely popular horror/psycho show known as Death Note. <br />
<br />
In many of those ridiculous bouts, Chika Fujiwara often steps in to interfere as a third-party member and basically break up the amusing tension between the two main characters, thus helping the show’s direction not become painfully predictable. The two other notable support characters, Yu Ishigami and Ai Hayasaka, also function as additional gears to the machine that drives and expands upon Kaguya and Miyuki’s relationship as well as displaying their own unique individual perks that can occasionally draw more interest to them than the two primary protagonists. The three supporting characters not only add more composition to the story, but they also keep the regular doses of comedy from being boring or redundant. The narrator occasionally chimes in to explain the situations at hand and/or who won or lost the bout to add a tad bit of that cinnamon to finish off each segment.<br />
As funny as this show can be, beneath all the buffoonery are the heartfelt stories and backgrounds of young adults growing up and trying to address and move past their own individual difficulties (especially that of Kaguya). We should also be reminded that despite all the comedic gags, there is, without question, notable progress is steadily made between Kaguya and Miyuki in terms of their undisclosed feelings for each other, regardless of whether or not they ever confess to one another.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION/SOUND:<br />
I don’t always feel easy with A-1 Pictures, but their work here is absolutely amazing. Not only is the overly stylish SHAFT-like quality something for the eyes to behold and never lose sight of, it genuinely feels like scenes that have been literally ripped straight out from the manga source and bestowed with life and color. The usage of ever-changing camera angles actually helps to add to the “comedic tension” of each segment. The over-the-top exaggerations of facial expressions and the alternating of colors, tones, and highlights are set to complement the sense of tension or relief with each progressing scene. There is little or no issues with animated movement; in fact, it’s quite fluid and aesthetically pleasing for the most part.<br />
<br />
And oh yeah, about that ED theme featuring Chika’s dance moves…apparently one of the team members of the group that animated that particular segment is originally from Kyoto Animation, a studio known for its transcendent animation quality and character designs. No wonder why the entire dance routine invested more budget than the entirety of ToAru Index III and Date A Live III combined (and that’s still an understatement, in all honesty).<br />
<br />
The soundtracks are amazing and fit the contrasting moods of each scene, from the brief laid-back moments to the frantic scenes of the mind games. The opening theme is really catchy and represents the funky and energetic side of the story, while the ending theme gives more of a slightly somber but hopeful side, and it actually reflects the sad backstory and internal mindset of Kaguya, in particular. The voice acting is beyond amazing. It adds more emotion and life to the scenes and the characters as it synergizes with the complementary choices of animation. I’m pretty sure the seiyuus here had WAY too much fun with their scripts here, especially the guy who voices Yuu Ishigami, in particular.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
For this particular review, I’ll keep the rundown of the recurring characters short but sweet, because all five of them are of equal importance, in my opinion, even though I’m aware that the story is still centered on two of them.<br />
<br />
Kaguya Shinomiya is a multi-talented individual born to a wealthy family and literally has everything in terms of money and luxury. She is one that rationally and meticulously carries out her plans with that wealth and influence to outrageous lengths during her mental bouts with Miyuki. However, the flip side of her presents an extremely somber and tragic individual, bound and sheltered by the chains of family obligations. Because of this background, she is not adept with common knowledge like health education and internet usage. While she may be cold and snarky, she genuinely longs for true kindness, which propels her obsession to get Miyuki to confess.<br />
<br />
Miyuki Shirogane is an underprivileged but diligent young man who had to claw and scratch his way to the top of the student council via hard work and determination. He constantly works to assume as a perfect image and role model, to the point where it often became detrimental to his health. Miyuki is not one to easily go for luxury and expensive gifts, due to his poor background, and values money a lot more than most people. Whenever he’s involved with Kaguya, her reputation often intimidates him to the point of insecurity, causing him to overthink even in just minor situations. On the flip side, Miyuki is a genuinely kind and virtuous individual who cares more about the well-bring of others over his own objectives. This side of him can very well be the salvation that Kaguya needs one day, considering what was mentioned about the dark side of her own background.<br />
<br />
Chika Fujiwara is essentially the closest we get to having the straight man in this show. The way she conducts herself has essentially made her a popular meme. She is a lively eccentric individual whom almost always has a smile on her face and looks to have fun with her fellow council members. Her actions consists of either coming up with odd activities and ideas to being the unpredictable wrench thrown in the machine that drives Kaguya and Miyuki’s battles. She does the latter NOT because she is clueless, but more so because she doesn’t see the point of the squabbles in the first place. Chika is also very devious and underhanded when she tries cheating in many of the games that she comes up with, though she is exposed practically every time. Due to her childish antics and carefree nature, Chika’s role, as mentioned much earlier, serves to give more composition to the two main characters’ relationship as well as the settings around them.<br />
<br />
Yu Ishigami is a prime example of an extreme introverted individual. Due to an inferiority complex, he often has a pessimistic and depressing view on life, and will often go on the most epic of rants about stuff like youth, “normies”, and breast sizes. Ishigami is a character I really enjoyed due to his snarky and sarcastic remarks, which can often land him in trouble with either Kaguya or Chika (or both). Despite this part of him forged by his unfortunate past experiences, he is genuinely a nice guy willing to help others just like Miyuki, even if it is detrimental to his own pride and dignity.<br />
Ai Hayasaka is Kaguya’s personal valet and close friend, employed to the latter’s family. She can adopt multiple personalities to cater to each different situation she’s in, though her true one is not that much different from that of Kaguya. She is very loyal and caring for Kaguya, to the point where she will readily oppose the orders of the Shinomiya household. That one particular scene where Ai mumbled “drop dead, a**hole” toward Kaguya’s unloving father was a huge sign of that fierce loyalty.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:<br />
Needless to say, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the show. There was never one episode that bored me in particular, as the show’s comedy pretty much evolves on the fly. It was hard for me to really point out any major issues or pet peeves I could’ve had with most rom-coms nowadays. Nearly all types of emotions were elicited for me, from the sheer joy of laughter, to the frustration of missed opportunities, to the feelings of depression given by a certain character’s backstory (in case, Kaguya’s). While the pseudo-episodic nature can have me rushing to prepare myself for the siegeway to the next segment and the stare-downs during the bouts may feel like there could’ve more to them, they weren’t too much of something to call flaws for me, and in the end, I left the show with a huge feeling of satisifaction.<br />
<br />
OVERALL:<br />
Kaguya-Sama may not necessarily be a masterpiece in most people’s eyes, due to the its rather unique nature and segmented, semi-chronological format and crazy over-the-top visual presentations. However, if you like comedy in general or want a new twist to the potential of what rom-coms can achieve, then this show is more likely for you. Even if you’re the casual viewer, this show is one that you should at least give a shot with, as this is easily among the best things that anime nowadays has to offer.

    &quot;If I cover my ears, then my hands aren&#039;t free to protect my belly button!&quot;<br />
- Shoki no Chika<br />
<br />
Reminder: this review does not include any element of comparison with the manga and contains just a little bit spoiler (not too much). Of course, I have read the manga and it is very good, but I&#039;m not the kind of person who would want to compare an anime to its original source (it&#039;s kinda pointless to compare 3 hours of Grisaia to the 50 hours of its visual novel, for the sake of example); (and English is not my native tongue).<br />
<br />
Because tradition dictates it, here is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304865">
        short introduction to the anime: read the synopsis! Okay… You have a cool and smart but poor blond president, a very candid oujo-sama (how cute!), a perverse… I mean cute secretary and an otaku gamer treasurer.<br />
And if you want to distinguish yourself from the plebe: if you are asked to choose between the vice-president and the secretary, say that you prefer the girl with white hair and blue eyes! She is the real hidden heroine of this anime! (Or if you are not into imou… then just say that the best girl is the maid.)<br />
<br />
So, let&#039;s get to the heart of the matter: what makes Kaguya-sama so good? Of course, it&#039;s a comic anime, so if the number of your laugh while watching Kaguya-sama is close to zero, then you&#039;ll certainly find it bad. As for me, even before the anime finishes airing, I have already rewatched it at least three or four times, and I’m still dying of laughing every minute, and sometimes every twenty seconds.<br />
Yes, I am an extreme case of someone who loves this anime.<br />
<br />
So, you have your answer. Kaguya-sama is so good because it makes you burst out laughing. Do I need to bother myself more than that? The humor of this anime is simple, made up of sitcomics, facial exaggerations and overreactions (Chika!), misunderstandings, puns, childish jokes (chin chin!)... All of it made me laugh.<br />
Furthermore, there is also a romance that is developed, which can both make us laugh and simply make us appreciate what it has to offer. The interactions, dialogues, in addition of making one laugh, are very fluid, dynamic and well juxtaposed, which are not useless chatter as in other comedy animes.<br />
All this makes up the remarkable staging of the characters, their interaction and their daily life (in a way). You can enjoy Kaguya-sama without necessarily laughing at each of its gags, because the anime also offers moments of slice of life, school life and it most often brings us closer to the characters.<br />
<br />
Among those who did not like it, I bet some will justify the &quot;why they did not like it&quot; with arguments such as: &quot;the jokes were repetitive&quot;, &quot;oh no, it’s another cliché romcom&quot;, instead of saying that this is just not their type of humor. Of course, sometimes a repetition of a scheme or the same element can destroy the enjoyment. However, this is not systematic, and Kaguya-sama is proof of that: from the first to the last episode, there was not a single one in which I did not burst out laughing. Regarding the &quot;cliché&quot; matter, it would be selfish if you were to impose your point of view, because by &quot;cliché&quot; it actually depends on your anime experience and culture, and sometimes one could not be bothered by the cliché or even enjoy it! (Gotoubun, Monogatari Series…)<br />
<br />
So, to put it simply, it&#039;s my anime of the season, and I&#039;m glad I can say it. I loved this anime so much that I would say it&#039;s the best comedy anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my life (yes, I’m an extreme case…), and I hope that it would encourage you to go to read the manga! (some chapters have not been adapted)<br />
<br />
To conclude with a personal point, I loved the opening and endings of this anime (Chikatto Chika Chikattsu of course), the charadesign is magnificent (especially the girls&#039; eyes) and the seiyuu are always at the top of their performance!<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it, thank you for reading and feel free to give me a feedback.

    I did not like the series, most people say that this series is innovative ... but I say, in what innovates? same composition of characters in any romantic novel (the 2 tsundere protagonists who like each other, but none dares to take a step to the point that it becomes annoying, secondary characters whose only function is to look silly on screens to make people laugh no deeper development).<br />
<br />
In my opinion until the anime of ueno-san is better than this since at least does not have the typical composition among its characters.<br />
In short, I do not see that people see this anime when there are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303296">
        much better romantic comedies.<br />
<br />

    &quot;O kawaii koto~&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine if Death Note was a romcom. Imagine that Light and L were not trying to outwit each other with the world itself at stake, but rather just that they actually liked each other romantically but were too shy and awkward to just it outright. Do you think that sounds ridiculous? Maybe, but that&#039;s more or less the idea behind Kaguya-sama. Well, except it&#039;s not yaoi of course.<br />
<br />
If you ever need a benchmark for how to do a romcom really damn good, then look no further than this. There really aren&#039;t many series within the genre out there that can manage to not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304861">
        just be cute and hilarious, but actually quite intelligent as well, but Kaguya-sama does it all. The anime follows the daily lives of Shirogane Miyuki and Shinomiya Kaguya, the top two students at Shuchiin Academy, and also president and vice president respectively of its student council. They&#039;re both geniuses and they&#039;re also both hopelessly in love with each other, however they&#039;re also... two tsunderes incapable of ever taking the first step themselves. In fact, due to how proud they are, they think confessing to someone is a sign of weakness as it implies that the one being confessed to is more valuable and desirable than the person doing the confessing, and this fact combined with their shyness have them both 100% determined to never make the first move. Instead, they both try to do everything they can to mind game the other into confessing to them first, no matter how complex the scheme required to accomplish that may be. As a result, you have a perfect setup for complete and utter hilarity.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a brilliant concept in general and it&#039;s executed really well, mainly thanks to how loveable the characters are and how the chemistry between them works. The show is definitely not just about Shirogane and Kaguya: the other members of the student council are just as important to the anime&#039;s enjoyment. The cheerful and free-spirited secretary Chika is the consistent X-factor of the series who always ends up somehow interfering with the main duo&#039;s carefully thought-out plans and flip everything on its head, whereas the introverted and somewhat paranoid treasurer Ishigami is probably the most normal and relatable character in the show, although I wouldn&#039;t go as far as to call him the voice of reason either. In any case, the point is that they&#039;re all very different from each other and they work perfectly together as a group as they all operate in harmony to emphasize each other&#039;s gags. Kaguya-sama is a comedy first and foremost, operating in a “one sketch per chapter&quot; basis in the manga, and in the anime they&#039;re essentially doing three of those scenes per episode. Now that is not to say that it does not have romance too, but it is a very slow burn on that front, and at the very least in the span of what the anime covers, it is not really the primary focus.<br />
<br />
Kaguya-sama is a very well-directed comedy show that makes great use out of a brilliant original concept, and really anyone with a decent sense of humour should be obligated to check it out. Great narrative, surprisingly good production value by A-1 standards, and just a very charming series in general.<br />
<br />
PS: Chika&#039;s dance as the ED of episode three is probably the greatest thing you&#039;ll ever see.
