Twenty five more episodes worth of charming romance and competitive karuta fun? Yes please. But don&#039;t expect a balance between the two; there&#039;s more latter quantity than the former, and whether you should be satisfied or not is up to your preference!<br />
<br />
Who expected, or even acknowledged beforehand, that the true presence of competitive karuta would be ever so fierce and exciting from its outline? Well, I sure certainly didn&#039;t when I started from season one. Karuta is more of a complicated sport than popular ones such as baseball and basketball, and the entirety of season one teaches that it requires much more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103483">
        than just reaction timing and memorization to win against other players. I enjoyed season one thoroughly, but watching karuta itself doesn&#039;t just hold its exciting entertainment factor by itself; there&#039;s a much larger insightful fulfillment that keeps its presence in each and every match. It&#039;s certainly more complicated than just slapping cards in front of people.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s what the second season is all about: Karuta, karuta, karuta! Chihayafuru 2 is a direct sequel to its previous entry, Chihaya and her team now in second year of high school. Chihaya is determined to, not only win the individual matches tournament upcoming to earn the Queen title, but to win the team tournament too, as well as establishing more members for the Mizusawa Karuta Club. It sounds difficult, and possibly silly considering it&#039;s still studying period, but this is Chihaya we&#039;re talking about; the pretty tomboy with a mind of karuta and karuta only. Who&#039;s going to stop her?<br />
<br />
Despite being a direct sequel in terms of story, it does have its noticeable differences. Hardly any distinct features are involved mind; it&#039;s more of taking a step up on its previous features that made Chihayafuru for what it is. The central feature of the second season is the sight of karuta matches itself. If you wished for much more screen time on people competing in karuta from the first season, then you&#039;ll be delighted to know that your wish has be gracefully granted. If you&#039;re for the romance and sweet relationships though, as well as full development between the childhood friends Chihaya, Arata and Taichi, then you might be a little more unfortunate than Taichi himself.<br />
<br />
The execution of each specific karuta match are all intense as ever. I&#039;d say that probably more than half of the entire season covers the moments of the involvement of karuta matches, and without its sole execution the series wouldn&#039;t have been as exciting throughout. Its execution is graceful yet powerful, as well as being a little in-depth in its playful manner, from thought processes of the players themselves to tackling particular cards pronounced from the reader. Some scenes, preferably the opponents winning their cards against one another, can be striking in a single movement, maybe even breath-taking. The careful use of atmosphere and enthusiasm of winning or playing makes use of, and surpasses, the original Chihayafuru style from the first season. With the accompany of animation and the soundtrack, as well as different sorts of techniques and tactics used from each and every player, the passion and spirit created from these matches are very sensational whilst keeping the original, youthful atmosphere of the series.<br />
<br />
But karuta isn&#039;t all just intensity in its matches. Season two explores the sport in a more exhaustive manner than the former season, and not just directly but indirectly too. Karuta is exciting because of the players themselves, but not solely because of their different levels of skill, style and tactics; it&#039;s more so as to why they&#039;re playing in the first place. Motivation, determination, pleasure, teamwork, whether its for a special someone or a particular goal, is all present in the characters of Chihayafuru. And karuta itself explores the different reasonings for lots of different players involved in the matches, which branches up the pasts and difficulties those characters have inside themselves. Realization can succeed to develop a character in a flowing manner, and that, despite it being a win or a lost, they learn something precious and important for their lives by their opponents.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s the reason why this season, or the entirety of the series in this case, are filled with a great amount of extremely heart warming and tear worthy scenes. You&#039;d love to cheer on one of the characters, like Chihaya, in a match to achieve her dreams, but that can&#039;t be entirely the case when the determination and reasoning of the opponent is involved too. Even when one seems in a tight or hopeless situation, you know how slump you&#039;re going to feel if the lost is given instead of a win. The motivation for each characters, even and especially side characters, are real. They&#039;re hardly one dimensional, and the match doesn&#039;t only determine if one has won or lost, but if their hard work and conviction has really paid off. The character&#039;s important speeches and actions boil down to karuta, even if slightly, and proves that the competitive sport has created a new light for these people; for something to devote and work towards to and be proud of it.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a plus too that the characters are in a wide range of variety, in both their motivation and personality. I can say without doubt that every single main and side character are likable and interesting, or at least from my preference. Nevertheless, there&#039;s a good deal of depth spiraled in each character, and most aren&#039;t so evidential until later on. They appear as mere opponents, not cardboard cut-outs but ones you wouldn&#039;t actually feel for if they lose. To be likable or not, they have distinct tropes that creates their characters, which are also for comedic factors which is a plus. But when their matches start, their pasts and goals begins to establish, and despite rooting for the other opponent because you&#039;ve spent more time with them, your understandings for the character gets established as well. I find that the characters of the series all play out with interesting personalities, mysterious or not, and that their love for karuta is evidentially taken care of, rather than just written on the spot.<br />
<br />
The series doesn&#039;t actually consists a whole load of content you&#039;d expect from a two cour season. The speed of pacing is evidential throughout the series, as some matches can actually last longer than a episode or three. To consider it a problem in the fact that a little more content could&#039;ve been included wouldn&#039;t be hugely anticipated, but it hardly is a problem if you consider wisely. Matches are, as explained earlier, made extremely well with a great deal of enjoyment factor, and the long scenes allows the different insights of each character to develop and to be explored. The pacing is necessary for this, as well as being able to build tension and anticipation on who would win or what will happen next. Though some of the matches can be predictable, the series focuses more on the depth of the players instead of the actual results itself, and plus it relies heavily on execution rather than shock factor, in which was a sensible decision to choose for a series like Chihayafuru.<br />
<br />
As for the romance side of Chihayafuru, season one definitely contains a bigger portion of it. That doesn&#039;t mean to say that this season doesn&#039;t consist of no romance, but unlike the first season there are no episodes that fully dedicate the love between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. The story behind all this continues, but doesn&#039;t develop so much throughout the series, rather it&#039;s used effectively throughout the minds of the stated characters; which leads to the motivational stories behind them that connects them to karuta in the first place. For those who side for more karuta though, it&#039;s presented in a manner that doesn&#039;t greatly effect the drama and tension in the series, so enjoyment factor would hardly be bumped down because of the romance.<br />
<br />
Production values for the second season are not the greatest and grandest, although this is to be at least expected for 50 episodes altogether. However, animation is handled with great care and is used efficiently; both animation and sound are created well for the distinct atmosphere and style for Chihayafuru. Often, still shots are used for the usual swings and hits on the cards, but with great speed and accompany of sound and different textures of colours, as well as various effects in the scenes, it doesn&#039;t fail to look awkward or slow in any of them. Budget can look pale from far distances in shots, but when the more graceful or powerful scenes come along, the backgrounds and detail can look anything as beautiful with a fluffy aura or tension effect surrounding it, depending on the scene. It does this when necessary and makes the scenes even more memorable than it already was.<br />
<br />
The youthful atmosphere is also accompanied by a very expressive soundtrack, applying brand new songs as well as ones from the first season. They are often orchestrated with light instruments like piano and strings, though does consists of acoustic guitars, bass and drums, and even pipes, flutes and traditional drums comes in the soundtrack. It gives a wonderful personality for the actual series to use, and although most are light-hearted or light-weighted, they&#039;re used really effectively in contrast of its atmosphere. The volume is oriented carefully so that the sound effects makes the karuta matches a lot more practical and engrossing for the viewers, building up a better experience to watch.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m glad series like Chihayafuru are still being aired. Produced by Madhouse and presented from the director of Cardcaptor Sakura, Chihayafuru manages to be an extremely enjoyable series with what it has to offer, not holding back with its execution on the theme of karuta. Anime doesn&#039;t necessarily need shock factor for a viewer to be surprised, and this series proves that execution is anything but less important than surprises. It&#039;s quite astonishing for me as to how much love I can express for a series I certainly didn&#039;t expect to ramble about, and especially one about a sport I have never heard of in my life until I started season one. It goes to show though that even such premises can contain a lot more potential than anime ideas that are more accessible for viewers, but fail to deliver because of its execution or lack of exploration in its concept.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t regret starting Chihayafuru and its sequel; the only regret I&#039;ll have is not being able to play proper competitive karuta because I&#039;m in the entirely wrong place. But at least Chihayafuru was a charming experience, and I hope it inspires even more people out in Japan to compete in karuta than season one already has.

    As the two seasons present themselves much as a continuous series, with little to set them apart, this review is made and posted for both seasons of the series.<br />
<br />
If there is one word that describes Chihayafuru, it is &quot;passion&quot; - indeed, &quot;Chihaya furu&quot; means passionate. On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you&#039;re typically served the main characters&#039; opponents&#039; motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters&#039; journey through the world of this sport,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105381">
        and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that&#039;s the gist of it.<br />
<br />
While it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won&#039;t find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned &quot;passion&quot; as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something.<br />
<br />
Another thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the &quot;I want to win&quot;/&quot;This is my motivation!&quot; portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it&#039;s a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner.<br />
<br />
Aesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors&#039; performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction.<br />
<br />
When all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn&#039;t a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series&#039; focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series.

    So, you ever tried something in your life and wanted to be the best? Well, I mean in terms of not really being the best but to try your best. Then, you realize that you journey to success is a lot harder than you ever imagined it to be. There are obstacles such as competition, stress/anxiety, and other factors that can influence your path to that destination. However, there are some people who just loves to try in order to become the best of the best no matter what the outcomes are. For a certain young girl named Chihaya, the journey continues with this brand

        new sequel by the name of Chihayafuru 2.<br />

Finally, Chihayafuru is back with the sequel known as Chihayafuru 2. I was quite excited when I heard the making of a sequel. When Winter 2013 came, I was even more thrilled. Indeed, the series comes back full force with its card game of karuta. Make no mistake, Chihayafuru 2 is the direct sequel of the original series (season 1) written by Yuki Suetsugu. The series continues from season 1 with Chihaya and what she does at best: playing karuta. Now, not everything is the same of course because there are various changes to this season. However, this sequel still achieved satisfaction for me and I am grateful to say that I enjoyed this series quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The series still adapts the same theme of karuta. It&#039;s a game played in Japan based on traditional anthology style of compiling Japanese waka poetry. Of course, the idea of card games incorporated into animation form isn&#039;t anything new to the entertainment realm. In fact, series such as the popular Yugioh franchise and Cardfight Vanguard have already adapted these themes. What makes Chihayafuru 2 stand out though is the way the games are played. Rather than just mind games being played between players as a way to gain dominance against one another, karuta also tests the wits of competitors in ways they&#039;ve never done before. It requires quick thinking, skill, memorization, and a little luck to pull out victories. For Chihaya, victory is something she always aim for between herself and her teammates. It&#039;s may just be a game but for her, it&#039;s also a dream and she hopes to reach make it into a reality; a dream of becoming the best karuta player in Japan.<br />
<br />
As expected, the competition and intensity is high this season especially with both new teammates and adversaries introduced. Among some of the returning characters includes both Chihaya&#039;s childhood friends Arata and Taichi. Both of them are skilled karuta players although they have conflicting views on one another. Fresher new faces includes Sumire Hanano, a fresh new face who makes her debut. Unlike Arata or Taichi, she lacks the skills or experience of a pro. In fact, she is one of those girls who is much more interested in boys and her appearances rather than the game of karuta itself. Her eyes is set on a particular character in the series and often tries to win his affections. At the same time, she views Chihaya as a sort of &#039;love rival&#039; despite the fact that there is nothing going on between her and Sumire&#039;s crush. Needless to say, the romance of this sequel is somewhat higher than its original series. Oh and who can forget about the love triangle between Arata, Chihaya, and Taichi? The one in the middle is Chihaya and she&#039;s the center of it all.<br />
<br />
Among one of the key components to succeed not only in karuta but also in life is teamwork. Sometimes, you can&#039;t rely on everything yourself. For a certain individual, this is especially true. Yes, I&#039;m talking about Sumire. Teamwork is important no matter what a task is. Without teamwork, a team will fall apart and conflicts will arise. As thus, this season has a lot of that expressed through directly in the form of karuta matches. There is also this feeling of suspense I get throughout each and every karuta match. It&#039;s hard to tell sometimes who will win when both teams are so dynamic and focused in their ambition to win. Each team in fact is also unique and has their own trademarks. Among some of these trademarks can be humorous but dangerously effective at the same time. Then, there&#039;s the concept of strategies involved in karuta. It takes practice to perfect these strategies in order to succeed. After all, Arata wasn&#039;t born as a prodigy and Shinobu wasn&#039;t born as the Queen. You get the idea.<br />
<br />
The karuta games itself stays consistent and once again brings back the nostologia of this sequel. Honestly, I miss it. I also liked the concept of the game as more strategy, intensity, and anticipating your opponent&#039;s every move in order to respond accordingly. The game itself also seems to be difficult to master as it requires memorization and various strategies. Just like in the real life game, karuta also requires quick movements and intuition. This is especially true for taking your opponents&#039; cards in order to gain the advantage. To add to the serious atmosphere of the show, most players has his or her definite style of play. It even comes with a unique outfit too sometimes with pretty kimonos, team headbands, or in the case of Shinobu...that adorable T-shirt that you can&#039;t help but keep your eyes off of.<br />
<br />
The bond between the various members of the team is also an important aspect of the sequel. In fact, throughout later episodes, members of Chihaya&#039;s team demonstrates skills like they&#039;ve never done before. This is seen in both their team and individual matches. It&#039;s the results of their practice and competing against other members throughout the series. At the same time, we can also trace their emotions through the bonding they have and the passion they share with karuta. Whether these emotions are joy, tearful, romantic, or intense, all the members of Chihaya&#039;s team shines through some way. As that being said, it&#039;s a good idea to keep watching this show and appreciate what they&#039;ve gone through.<br />
<br />
The plot direction of sequel seems to be a bit sluggish. It seems that some of the karuta matches are extended and the pacing becomes almost unbearing to endure. It certainly does not help with an recap episode at one of its more crucial points of the series. Additionally, despite the initial romance being set up somewhat in the beginning of this series, it seems to fall apart and remains more as a background theme. There are moments when the &#039;love triangle&#039; is bought up again but most of it remains more as as minor setback. It&#039;s no surprise though as the majority of the show is focused on karuta as that&#039;s what the series is about. It puts karuta to test for the characters and develops them both physically and mentally. Finally, the show seems to also play on an idea of anticipation. It&#039;s clear that some fans from season 1 would like to see some potential matches or rematches. However, some of these left me mixed impressions by the way they were executed in particular of a rematch later on. The shows&#039; pacing pushes that anticipation so it takes some patience to get through.<br />
<br />
As for the artwork, the series remains artistic and natural. It doesn&#039;t&#039; try to force any fan service at all nor does it make the characters look outstanding. Even with the looks, Chihaya looks like a normal girl but with a powerful dream. The rest of the casts also remains consistent. In particular, some of the younger players of the show gives off that look of innocence and youth. It symbolizes youth in the case of growing up and playing karuta as a way to achieve success. The josei like backgrounds and atmosphere gives off that ideal atmosphere of karuta game. Additionally, the fast pace and camera angles reflects on the intensity of the competition.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack gives off that feeling of nostologia as well. The OP song &quot;STAR&quot; by 99RadioService gives an impression of some of the potential competitors in the series. The background music leaves behind that feeling of intensity and also rejoice throughout each karuta game. Finally, I thought that the VA did their jobs right in particular some of the more experienced players such as Shinobu and Arata.<br />
<br />
For fans, this show is definitely something worth time to enjoy and appreciate. It is also essential to watch season 1 before picking up this sequel as this series continues directly from its previous season. If you&#039;re looking for a colorful cast of characters, then you&#039;re definitely at the right place. Even if you don&#039;t like the idea of card game themed series or in general, karuta itself, it should could be a refreshing watch. It&#039;s about learning how to appreciate dreams and to walk a path to success with yourself and your teammates. I appreciated this sequel and definitely did not regret watching this. Chihayafuru 2 is worth the watch even if you&#039;re not into the sports genre. It&#039;s refreshing and takes on the idea like karuta like never ever before.

    This will be my first review I&#039;ve ever made, so i&#039;m sorry if this wasn&#039;t as good as you&#039;d expect.<br />
<br />
I started off watching this anime because my brother recommended me it, so if it wasn&#039;t for him, I wouldn&#039;t have watched it. I started off watching the first season, and I just thought that the art was pretty good, it wasn&#039;t the best but the main characters attracted me, Chihaya mostly. So therefore, I really people out there to watch this anime too, or give it a try because it&#039;s not too shabby.<br />
<br />
So this anime you might think, is just a plain old Japanese card

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95827">
        game. It&#039;s not, well too Chihaya it isn&#039;t. When Chihaya was younger, her school had karuta tournaments which means she would know how to play it a little because their shcool taught her. One day, a new transfer student arrived. and he was in Chihaya&#039;s class, his name was Arata, he didn&#039;t really talk much, then Taichi started bullying him because he never talked.<br />
<br />
I know this Anime isn&#039;t finished yet, well it&#039;s at 16 episodes, for me, but when you read this the series might have already finished. <br />
<br />
Story [9/10] - I gave this anime a 9/10 for story because I like seeing the main character just own people, people at the same time, it&#039;s funny, maybe a little romance. I hate it when the main character is completely hopeless and the story line makes no sense, as if for this anime, every thing made sense from the start. <br />
<br />
Art [8/10] - The art is very good, it&#039;s not like super professional but it works. The art is kind of unique, I don&#039;t see this art much at all. The only thing that made me not give the art 9/10 or 10/10 was just the eye lashes, I don&#039;t know I guess it&#039;s just a pet peeve.<br />
<br />
Character [10/10] - The way they made it so Chihaya had a goal in life made it more interesting, from the first episode [ season 1 ] to now, it actually explain a lot about most characters, un-like some animes. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment [9/10] - I really did enjoy this anime series, even though this whole anime is about a bunch of people who focus on playing a card game to become the best, it some action in it, like sometimes Chihaya would get in sticky situations where she doesn&#039;t know what to do, but if she loses the game, she tries to learn what she did wrong and try to over come it to become a better karuta player.<br />
<br />
Overall [9/10] - Overall this anime was great, most people might no know about this anime because I don&#039;t see this on top animes, but don&#039;t underestimate it, it&#039;s very good in my opinion.

     I&#039;m going to be writing this review in assumption that you, the readers, have already watched the first season of Chihayafuru. I dove into this second season with high expectations from the first, and *most* of those expectations were satisfied. We follow Chihaya and everyone else into another year of karuta, drama, and romance. This season explored new themes and served as a lovely follow up to the first.<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Chihayafuru&#039;s story is mostly known for two things: romance and karuta. If you were looking forward to more romance between our three main characters this season, then I suggest you look somewhere else. This portion

          <span style="display: none;" id="review107427">
        of the story has a huge chunk of karuta and focuses mainly on Chihaya and her friends&#039; abilities, motives, rivals, and passion. While the romance may be minimal, the amount of drama and emotion has not changed a bit. The matches have gotten more intense, to the point where you feel the character&#039;s pain, pressure, and happiness. Each new enemy gives our team more experiences and lessons, making them stronger and stronger. The story for the second season lived up to the first and did well. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9.5/10<br />
The characters of Chihayafuru make the show pleasant and fun to watch. They&#039;re portrayed in a way that makes you feel like they&#039;re your friend and all you want is the best for them. Chihaya, the main heroine, is the same as always: hyper, passionate, ambitious. This season we really see her grow as a karuta player and as a friend as she faces trials and challenges. Taichi, the first main hero, goes through development as well. A seemingly perfect boy with his own problems, we come to see him for what he truly is and wish for nothing but his happiness. And finally, Arata. Portrayed as a karuta prodigy but also a dear friend to Chihaya and Taichi. His relationship with these two is heavily explored upon and is very pleasant to watch. Overall, the characters in Chihayafuru are full of life, growth, and development.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The sound effects and soundtrack for Chihayafuru 2 are incredibly breathtaking. The opening and closing songs are sweet and calming, matching the tone of the show. The music played throughout scenes and matches bring out the emotion even more, serving its purpose well while being a delightful treat for the ears. Every sound effect throughout the anime is spot on, from the heavy breathing to the whack of hands to the tatami mat. The sounds of Chihayafuru are beautiful and help tell the story even better than expected.<br />
<br />
Animation: 9/10<br />
Chihayafuru has a reputation for being an aesthetically beautiful anime, and its animation quality and colors help uphold this reputation. I can&#039;t describe it as anything else other than clean and beautiful. The small details, colors, shadings made me feel like I was watching a painting in motion rather than an anime. The quality was beautiful and the designs were fantastic. However, there were some scenes where the character designs looked sloppy and quickly done. Rather than that, most of the art in Chihayafuru 2 left a great impression on me.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9.1/10<br />
The animated sequel to Chihayafuru did justice to its predecessor. Although the main reason for the animation was to bring in more sales for the manga, it still gained high respect and a lot of good feedback. Mostly everything about the show was done in a way that compliments the themes of the story. It&#039;s unknown whether or not a third season will be made, but many (including me) hope so.

    &quot;Impassioned gods have <br />
never seen the red that is the <br />
Tatsuta River.&quot; <br />
<br />
-Poem 17 of the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu <br />
<br />
The poem now most well known to viewers of Chihayafuru was written by Ariwara no Narihira, detailing his unsuccessful relationship with Fujiwara no Takaiko. After falling madly in love with each other, the two would be lovers attempt to run away from the palace. Naturally, given the rather wispy and nostalgic tone of the poem, this attempt failed in a spectacular fashion. Despite this, Ariwara no Narihira became well respected much later on and was most likely the basis for the nameless hero of &quot;The Tales

          <span style="display: none;" id="review102879">
        of Ise.&quot; His name, along with other famous poets, such as Ono no Komachi and Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, were later included in the Thirty Six Immortals of Poetry. <br />
<br />
History lesson aside, the poem invokes an impression of a deep crimson color, both literally and figuratively. The literal reflection of the water and the red of passion and emotion. The second season of the sleeper hit &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; certainly adds to the overall experience of the series, building on the budding character relationships and the surprisingly intense matches of karuta. Virtually unknown to most before watching &quot;Chihayafuru,&quot; I can say with confidence that the game of karuta depicted in the series is as action packed as a card game based around classical Japanese poems can get. &quot;Chihayafuru 2&quot; builds largely on what made the first season successful, but seems to crank up the intensity to sweltering levels. <br />
<br />
Of course, if you happen to be reading this review and have not yet seen the first season of &quot;Chihayafuru,&quot; do yourself a favor and watch the first season before naturally going on to the second season.  <br />
<br />
The story continues the adventures of karuta-obsessed high school girl Chihaya Ayase and the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, as they reach greater heights, challenging themselves and the swarms of intense competition around them. Highlights of their karuta careers involve the high school and national tournaments, events that are a central focus to the members of the karuta club. The first and second season differ in that the second season focuses much more attention on the tournaments and the individual mindsets of the characters. Character development takes place during the fierce matches everyone plays and the interactions during down time. Karuta, despite the rather simple premise of matching one half of a poem to another, takes a surprising amount of stamina, speed, and strategy. Chihaya comically seems to immediately fall asleep at the conclusion of her matches, a cute way of relating the tremendous physical and mental endurance needed to play competitively. <br />
<br />
A popular dilemma for club based shows are the disturbingly small amount of members becoming a major problem for school administration, and of course, the club will be disbanded if they don&#039;t find new members. Chihaya and the team manage to find two freshman to fill the empty spots, managing to find two people with very different reasons for joining the club. The two new members, Sumire Hanano and Akihiro Tsukuba, are honestly overshadowed by the beloved returning members, but their presence gives interesting contrast to the veterans of the team. For Sumire, who joined only to get closer to the club president, Taichi Mashima, and for Tsukuba, who joined to learn the mainland version of karuta, their growth and development towards their love of the sport and the team is a wonderful journey. <br />
<br />
While karuta remains the main focus of the show, another major focal point of the show is the love triangle between Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata Wataya. The first season introduced this romantic subplot and highlighted mostly Arata&#039;s struggle to come to grips with his grandfather&#039;s death and the return of his old friends and Taichi&#039;s exasperated attempted to get his dense childhood friend to notice his sincere feelings for her. As Chihaya&#039;s love for the game of karuta grows, she begins dedicating more and more of herself to becoming the best she can be, coming to terms with her current relationships and her shortcomings as both a karuta player and as a normal person. Romance is definitely in the air, with looks of longing from Taichi, Chihaya&#039;s fascination with Arata, and Arata&#039;s desire to reunite with his old friends. There are some very beautiful scenes involving bringing the poetry to life and trying to understand what the poet was trying to convey, using images of summer days long past and flowers adorning the trees. Romance amidst classical poems can only add to the flowery nature of this series&#039; romance and the passion for both others and the game itself. <br />
<br />
In regards to animation quality, it is still excellent and crisp. Set in everyday places like school and classrooms give little room for diversity, but the artwork for &quot;Chihayafuru 2&quot; is vibrant and rich with color and light. Sparkles of sunlight bask the rooms of competitors and drops of rain accent the storm outside. Some of the most beautiful scenes concern explaining the meaning of the poems, invoking rich metaphors of ancient Japan, with calligraphy, flowers, and the gradual changing of seasons. Flashes of red, mountain ridges, the ever expansive sea and falling snow are just some of the images portrayed. It adds a more literary and poetic beauty to a show set in modern times. <br />
<br />
A familiar soundtrack accompanies the show, and adds to the mood of the show. The opening theme is &quot;STAR&quot; by 99RadioService, who also did the first season&#039;s opening, and the ending theme is &quot;Akane Sora&quot; by Asami Seto. Regarding the ending theme, it is played in different fragments at the end of the episode, and eventually the whole song can be heard if you string together the related parts. It was a fun way to get a glimpse of the wonderful full song, and the sweet, emotional music was a great way to end another intense day of karuta. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chihayafuru 2&quot; is my personal winner for this season of anime, and I am sad to see it go. Remembering my thoughts all the way back to the first season, I am surprised that a show with such a niche game could engross me so much. I looked forward to this show every week, and my Fridays are going to be a little less cheery with &quot;Chihayafuru 2&#039;s&quot; absence. Shows like these invoke emotion and transport viewers to the heated world of sports and makes the characters so much more likable, so much so that we will be cheering for their victories and feeling down at their defeats. This sequel builds on the world of karuta so expertly built in the first season and adds another layer of intensity and beauty, sometimes even exceeding the success of the first. <br />

    Chihayafuru season 2 is pretty disappointing.<br />
<br />
This season is incredibly slow compared to the first season. The main characters were developing well last season but they ground it to a halt in this one. Every match feels exactly the same, just with a different set of faces. The Mizusawa gang seemingly loses all confidence at the start of every match, but by the end of them, win or lose, they&#039;ve got Superman levels of confidence. EVERY match. <br />
<br />
This season has got more inner monologue per 26 minutes than any single human is capable in a day. The directors insist we know what all 100+ characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326709">
        thinking at all time, even when they are completely irrelevant to what&#039;s going on in the episode, and they insist on making every thought as detailed as a doctorate&#039;s thesis. The directors also insist on making every single emotion, positive or negative, super dramatic, as if our characters are trying to defuse a bomb. ALL THE TIME. Chihaya could be about to fart during a match, you would&#039;ve thought she just received a letter informing her that her mother died with how intense her reaction is. It takes so much away from the more genuine moments of the season.

    Hyakunin Isshu (literally &#039;hundred people, one poem&#039;) is a Japanese card game typically played with a collection of two hundred cards. Each poem in this collection is by a different poet, and split into two halves: the first half for reading, the second for grabbing. In a match, the reading halves are then called out, and pairs of players must race to grabbing the corresponding second half of the poem. Chihayafuru excels by making this game of stratagem into something too human to ignore. It has no regard for how silly or strange a passion for the game may be, because the only thing it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197220">
        concerned about is engrossing you as if you were a part of the deck itself. <br />
<br />
Whereas the first season primarily concerns the importance of friendship, the second is purely about self-improvement. A recurring theme is now the conflict between working for yourself versus working for others, and that is carried by the overarching nature of the storyline. It&#039;s  nothing extravagant, but gives a new side of maturity to a cast that was originally unrealistic or, in some cases, delusional. More notably, it makes it seem as if the characters are actually learning from the mistakes they commit—not only in karuta, but in life. Arata also has to make some tough choices between his reputation and friendship with Chihaya, all thanks to the perpetually active nature of the game. His motivation through loneliness goes directly against Chihaya&#039;s love for teamwork, but the schism continues to drive them forward. Always nice, huh? <br />
<br />
Still, there is an unshakable feeling that this package wouldn&#039;t hold up on its own, or that the handling is the only thing keeping the show afloat. Don&#039;t get me wrong: it&#039;s pretty decent, but I firmly believe that this series only works as television. The suspense from episode to episode would be completely nullified in the continuous nature of a movie or manga volume, or even the pages of a book. It is dancing on a sheet of thin ice that it never manages to break through, where a breakthrough would be more than welcomed. That aside, the experience you&#039;ll get here is fairly lovely.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s mostly thanks to presentation. As always, this show can stretch out mere in-universe minutes over an hour without becoming boring or too slow, more so now than ever. The art remains crisp and pastel, animation is consistently steady, and Madhouse never slips up. Music is seen as a way to add suspense or atmosphere and not much else, but it&#039;s a perfect way of handling things in a game where sound can be key. Some of the poetry readers sound better than ever, so I even have to ask myself if they hired actual professionals to do it. Either way, it should be enough to keep you happy. <br />
<br />
Basically, the second season of Chihayafuru shows notable improvement over the first while offering a promising future for the franchise. It continues to take its time with story and characters, but given the manga&#039;s sales, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a third anime season was soon announced. Oh, and you might wanna prepare to binge watch it.

    Combining my views on both seasons-<br />
<br />
A straight 10 for everything in this show.<br />
<br />
Story: The topic is difficult. Karuta is not a sport that any of the people outside Japan can relate to. And I don&#039;t think even in Japan this sport would be too famous. But this game has an extremely interesting concept of combining the Japanese poems with cards. For any sports anime the matches of that sport need to crafted extremely well for the show to get noticed and appreciated. This show does exactly that. The pacing of the scenes aptly builds up the atmosphere of an exciting match. <br />
<br />
Art and Animation: Well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117717">
        drawn characters and backgrounds. And fantastically animated matches. A card game like Karuta which involves fast moves on taking the cards which have poems written on them can be quiet a difficult challenge. If the animators would have tried to bring in too many slow motion scenes in trying to explain the moves, the matches would have looked dull. Also if only fast moves from the players were shown to showcase their skill in taking the cards, then it would have been too difficult to understand the sport at all. This is where narration by the characters from time to time on the moves helps understand their opponents moves. The animation has a very good balance of the fast+slow motion scenes to make the match look convincing and very exciting.<br />
<br />
Sound: Do I need to even say anything about this department? I have always experienced that Japanese voice actors express their characters emotions extremely well. The most important characters to voice in this show- the readers of the Karuta matches- they need to have the perfect pitching and tone for the Karuta players to recognize the letters being spoken clearly to take the cards as fast as they can. All voice actors do a brilliant job in voicing the readers. I loved that part in the show where 3 certified reader examiners are examining a reader during a match and under pressure he loses his rhythm. Actually till that point I didn&#039;t realize how important consistency in reading would be required for the players in general to focus. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit here, Miyano Mamoru&#039;s voice always catches my attention immediately.  He has done a brilliant job once again in voicing Taichi who is perhaps the most complicated character to voice in this show after the readers, since there needs to be the perfect pitching and tone for expressing his emotions throughout the show.<br />
<br />
And yes the background music for this show is just awesome. hats off to Yamashita Kousuke-sensei for a wonderful treat for the ears. Plus the OPs and EDs for both seasons are beautiful ! I personally loved the Akane Sora ED<br />
<br />
Character: I loved all the character personalities. Chihaya the airhead, Kana-chan the literature freak- I loved hearing to her explanations of the poems! You really do start to like the poems in the show once their meaning is explained so beautifully. maybe some of you can even make out while they are being read if you pay close attention. Komanu-kun&#039;s meticulous data collection and analysis of his opponents is another interesting way to build up strategies within Team Mizusawa to beat their opponents. And Taichi- I always felt his memorization skills are out of this world. To be able to keep track of all the poems that have already been read out during the match and then build a strategy for taking the cards was just awesome. I also loved his indirect way of expressing his feeling towards Chihaya. I really really hope his feelings are reciprocated by her someday &gt;.&lt; Arata is also a sweet person with godly skills. His cross countering wne taking cards against the match with Nishida and Queen was excellent !!  All the opponents in the show also have unique skills which have been nicely showcased in the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall: Though it was difficult at the beginning I loved watching this show for its excellent direction, pacing, animation, sound, some very meaningful dialogues, poems, the characters, the exciting matches and the relationships especially between Team Mizusawa&#039;s players. Each player supports their team members wholeheartedly. their were 3 occasions where I was crying like an idiot- When Chihaya suddenly cried after the Concert band gave their best wishes to the Karuta Club via their performance (in ep 07 of s2) before the nationals started 2) when Mizusawa won the Tournament as a team (ep 19 in s2) 3) when Taichi made to Class A (ep 23 in s2). All three scenes showcasing the emotions powerfully and very subtly !!<br />
<br />
Overall I had a wonderful time watching this show. And am praying hard that the story will get a closure with a season 3. A must watch !!

    (This has been slightly adapted from my reddit thread)<br />
<br />
(This is a review for Season One and Season Two)<br />
<br />
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms. A simple phrase that is said multiple times throughout the show, but truly invokes many different feelings: anxiousness, trepidation, excitement, confidence. What lies within Chihaya Furu is a spectacular show which has now become one of my all-time favorites.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Chihaya Furu has a simple story. Our main protagonist Ayase Chihaya is looking to become the Queen, or the best &quot;karuta&quot; player in the world. I think the phrase &quot;it is not the destination that matters, but the journey&quot; fits the show perfectly.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review160923">
        The show gives us Chihaya&#039;s goal early on. But it is not this goal that truly matters, it is what she encounters along the way that defines the story.<br />
<br />
So, why is the journey so important? What I found to be the most compelling was the struggle. Nothing ever comes easy for Chihaya and crew, and it really shows. Every match is a battle. Every match counts, whether it is for practice or it is their chance to advance to the next Class level. They all experience incredible highs and soul-crushing lows. During the matches, you are rooting for them to win, you want them to succeed. But a lot of the time, they don&#039;t. And that&#039;s what I liked the most; it was real. Chihaya isn&#039;t some karuta God right out of the gates. She experiences these amazing fights that test her both physically and mentally, no matter the opponent. However, when they do overcome their tough obstacles, you feel elated and revel in their glory right alongside with them.<br />
<br />
At this point, I need to talk about the game they are playing. &quot;Karuta&quot; or Hundred Poets, is a game that pits two players against one another in a game of quick reflexes and memorization. Being from America, I had no idea what karuta was at all before watching. But now, I feel as if I have a complete understanding and could even attempt to play others at the game. Granted, I would not be that good! But this is another strength of the show; it does a fantastic job of explaining all of the rules, all of the penalties, and all of the scenarios. Each match is looked at in-depth, and it never gets boring. You never feel as if they are repeating their motions, despite doing the exact same thing for 50 episodes.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Chihaya Furu is definitely a feast for the eyes. It becomes apparent right from the OP that the quality of the show is high, and it never falters all the way through. Starting with the environments, the show actually has quite the variety of set pieces, from cherry blossom roads to the shrine at Omi Jingu. The majority of the show takes place within buildings and on tatami mats, but when it is, the show loves to peer into the players minds, giving us beautiful, intense, or serene backgrounds to fit the mood at that moment.<br />
Something that I don&#039;t say about a lot of shows is how well done the lighting is. I was always amazed by how the sun struck the characters faces or how the lighting affected the scenes at night or within the rooms.<br />
<br />
In terms of animation quality, the most important part and coincidentally the best part, is when they are playing karuta. In particular, the swinging and motion of the players&#039; during every match was always well done. There would be quick-motion stills and slow-motion segments. There were in-real-time swings shown as well. Basically, witnessing the actual playing of the game was never boring and I was always hooked to the matches.<br />
<br />
The character designs were actually quite different from what I have seen in most shows. The best way to describe it would be &quot;mature&quot;. Sure, there are some who are slightly more &quot;anime&quot; then others (Desktomu, Retro, etc.), but the main players (Chihaya, Taichi, Arata, etc.) seemed like &quot;proper&quot; people. It simply added to an already amazing experience.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
By far the strongest part of the show is its characters. I cannot stress this enough; EVERY character is good. And there are a lot of them. Why is this the case? This is because that not only are the main players heavily developed, not only are the supporting characters heavily developed, but also the other sub-characters are developed to a great degree. As I said earlier, every match matters, and in the same vein every OPPONENT matters. The show actually takes considerable time to explain many different character backgrounds to let us understand where they are coming from and how they go about playing the game. And in this way, you care even when the one&#039;s you are not rooting for lose.<br />
<br />
On that note, Ayase Chihaya has become one of my all-time favorite characters. She is funny, beautiful, friendly, passionate, strong, emotional, and any other descriptor you can add on to her. She experiences the most change throughout the show, and rightly so. What I loved about the show in particular is how she doesn&#039;t grow simply by playing more. She grows as a person and especially as a player by learning from those around her. She becomes better at memorization through Taichi. She loves the poems through Kana. She utilizes the data gathered by Desktomu. She becomes stronger thanks to Porky. She gets more accurate by watching Shinobu. She takes every match seriously and because of that she constantly betters herself throughout the entirety of the series.<br />
<br />
And this is true for all of the characters. They use one another to eliminate their weaknesses and develop new strengths. You care about all of them, especially the gang from Mizusawa High. Each of them has their own style of play, even Chihaya, but it&#039;s their sense of family and teamwork that elevates them beyond their opposition.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
I actually thought the ED for both seasons were nice (season 2 more so than season 1), and the second season&#039;s OP was good, but I have fallen hard for season 1&#039;s OP, which can be listened to here. It always got me pumped up for the episode to come and I would always find myself singing along (or at least trying to!) with the lyrics and bobbing my head with the beat. This is now also one of my top OPs all-time, too.<br />
<br />
But what the show does great sound-wise is definitely the rest of the soundtrack. The battle music, the winning anthems, the ominous tones of imminent defeat; each piece of music fits perfectly with the mood they are presenting and really helps to give each scene a better overall atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Finally, the voice actors and actresses did a wonderful job in their roles. Chihaya, Taichi, Kana, Desktomu, Porky, Sumire, Tsukuba, etc. all had did their roles beautifully. Especially Arata, he and his Grandpa have this somewhat unique voice/way of talking (it&#039;s apparent when he says &quot;Chihaya&quot;) that stood out the most. Among all of them, Chihaya shines again, and she was always a joy to listen to.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
If it is not already apparent, I love this anime. I think I would go so far as to say it is now in my top three all-time. Everything about it is fantastic, and I can&#039;t really seem to find too much of a fault with it. Season 2&#039;s pacing is somewhat slower (for obvious reasons I will not mention), but I never felt as if the show was going too fast or too slow.<br />
<br />
There are genuine, real moments that will make you cry. There are heartwarming moments that will make you appreciate the characters on the screen, and make you think about similar experiences in your own life. And the show is also surprisingly funny, too. The humor is not in your face, but situationally relevant and always made me laugh.<br />
<br />
I would often find myself breathing in deeply with Chihaya to calm my own nerves. I was constantly rooting for Taichi to overcome his terrible luck. I was smiling alongside Arata as he played the game he loved. The show really got to me, not only as a fan of anime but also as a person; I really care about these characters and want them to succeed no matter what may come there way.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Great, Chihaya and the crew&#039;s journey is filled with every emotion possible<br />
<br />
Animation: Great, beautiful scenes, lighting, action, it has it all<br />
<br />
Characters: Great, some of the strongest characterization I have seen in a show<br />
<br />
Sound: Great, season 1 OP is to die for, entire soundtrack fits everything perfectly<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Great, this show needs to be seen by all<br />
<br />
Final score (both seasons): 10/10

    This series is excellent- I first found it as a Manga, but when I couldn&#039;t access chapters 49-88 I found the anime. I fell in love with this amazing anime because it is simply different. It steps out of the majority of it&#039;s genre stereotypes and appeals to it&#039;s audience in unconventional ways. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story works so well for me because it takes something as generally dull as a competitive card game, that is accessible to a huge variety of people- and uses that diverse range of characters and their different reasons for loving karuta to make the viewer falls in love with the game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99447">
        as well. <br />
I&#039;d never heard of it before watching the series and now playing it one day is on my bucket list.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
I have little to say on the art other than- it&#039;s beautiful. It&#039;s attention to the content works extremely well. Using karuta and the poems as the inspiration for the artwork and animation serves to immerse the viewer into the story and feelings of the characters.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound is very well done- I don&#039;t know enough about it to go into a detailed analysis, but it works to enhance the humor, the gravity, and environmental atmosphere that the characters are in. It makes me want to cry in frustration, joy and amusement at all the right moments.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This is where this anime really stands out for me. Not necessarily in the main characters (who are brilliant in their own right) but in the supporting characters as well. Very few of the characters that get even a little bit of screen time are in anyway dull or generic. <br />
The main character- Chihaya is possibly the most endearing female lead I have come across (she&#039;s a close rival with Koizumi Risa from Love*Com). She isn&#039;t the most original female lead character- predictably beautiful and kind and silly- but she has an intensity that makes it impossible to dislike her.<br />
The two main male characters- Taichi and Arata play off one another in a really great way that makes what could have been two very generic characters- the quiet, intense, glasses boy with talent, and the popular intelligent perfect prince, into something much more than that. This love triangle *that appears pretty much in the first episode so I wouldn&#039;t consider it a spoiler* is also something of a reversal of the norm- instead of the prince being the unattainable, it is the intense glasses boy- and he is unattainable in ways other than in romance, which makes Chihaya&#039;s relationship with Arata much more interesting.<br />
The more minor characters are all fantastic as well- Chihaya&#039;s teammates, rivals, and teachers are all substantial characters that interact with her and each other in tangible and touching ways. A lot of them are not stereotypically attractive- they are really a bunch of oddballs that Chihaya is able to reach through Karuta, and they all develop and grow and enjoy their lives because of it. They aren&#039;t your stereotypical oddballs either. They&#039;re all a rather different breed.<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoy watching this anime and recommend it to anyone that&#039;s looking for a refreshing take on the sport/shoujo/shounen genres.

    AND IT CONTINUES .....this anime is just beautiful. If I had to choose one word to describe this show, it would be that. Only very rarely do sequels get to be as good as the first season, and this is one of those. If you have seen the first season then I am sure you can agree as to just how masterfully the producers create the world that Chihaya lives in. It makes you want to play and learn along with her! <br />
<br />
All the wonderful characters are back in Chihayafuru 2, and they even introduce a few newbies. I will admit however, that the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97729">
        characters aren&#039;t as enticing as the original cast. What really keeps me waiting for the new episodes to air is Chihaya&#039;s love life. I find myself rooting for her to finally open her eyes and realize! The writers keep hinting and as the viewer it kind of drives you nuts! Haha, but that just may be me though. Becoming the top team, and the drive to beat the Queen are another big storyline factor this time around. I&#039;m desperately hoping one of those two things happen by the end of this season!<br />
<br />
The storyline aside, the imagery and sound are a HUGE part of what makes this anime so special. I had to give it a 10 for on both counts. You really see the passion in their eyes, every sweat, every piece of magic behind the game ....the art really pulls you in! You feel what they feel. <br />
<br />
Overall, I&#039;m left wishing there will be yet another season to this anime and it does Chihaya and her friends justice.

    A bit disappointing after Chihayafuru.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, Chihayafuru 2 is still very good anime.  Of the ~200 anime series I&#039;ve seen, I&#039;d easily rank it in the top 10%.  However, it is pretty much a sports/fighting anime, whereas the original series was more about story and character development.  So if you got hooked on the original for those reasons, consider yourself forewarned - you&#039;re not gonna see much of that in the sequel.<br />
<br />
In the original series, most episodes were a self-contained story.  A character(s) would encounter a problem or a situation, struggle with it, and overcome it, and grow in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review100553">
        the process.  Meanwhile you got to learn more about the characters, the game, and there was some movement on the meta-plot involving the love triangle.  Occasionally there was a 2-parter with a cliffhanger in the middle, and there was one multi-part storyline if I remember right.  But overall the series covered a lot of time and subplots in 25 episodes.<br />
<br />
There is very little of that in Chihayafuru 2.  It has eschewed the endearing character-centered formula from the original, and replaced it with the standard sports/fighting formula of long, drawn-out confrontations.  The focus is now on the matches and how they play out.  The vast majority of the episodes are play-by-play sequences of the tournament matches.  There are even one or two matches which span two episodes.  That&#039;s right - whereas the first series would spend at most two episodes to cover an entire *tournament*, the sequel spends that many episodes on a single *match*.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s all very well executed, and I&#039;ve been glued to every episode so far.  That&#039;s why I still gave it a 8 for enjoyment and overall rating.  But that&#039;s almost entirely because I&#039;ve seen the original series, care about the characters enough to patiently wait for the meta-plot to progress, and now understand enough about the game to follow what&#039;s going on.  If I had watched Chihayafuru 2 first, I probably would&#039;ve dropped it after a few episodes - sports/fight anime are really not my thing.<br />
<br />
I can understand why they did it.  The original series did a pretty thorough job covering the basics of karuta, so all they have left is the meta-plot and showing you the finer points of the game.  Well, if they move the meta-plot too quickly, then the series is over.  So they have to create most of the drama using the finer points of the game.  It&#039;s done very well, and if you like sports/fighting anime you&#039;ll probably love this.  But as someone who was attracted to the original story by the characters and their development, I was only able to rate the story a 7. <br />
<br />
The art is just like the original.  Could be better, but very good with no major flaws or annoying quirks.  Well, the faces have no noses when viewed from the front, but that&#039;s pretty common in anime.<br />
<br />
The sound is better than the original.  Maybe it&#039;s that the focus on matches that allows for more dramatic music.  I dunno.  But I felt the music added a lot more to the series than in the original.<br />
<br />
Character development as I explained is minimal.  They add new first-year students to the club (in fact the first few episodes where they&#039;re added are very reminiscent of the original series).  But then the series quickly shifts focus to matches.  In the last dozen or so episodes (only 22 eps have aired so far), the new characters have been limited to a few reaction shots.  They probably could&#039;ve been removed entirely without drastically affecting the series.  The original characters are developed, but mostly in the context of the game (e.g. learning new strategies for playing).  Ironically, the character who seems to be getting the most personal development is the background-character/symbolic antagonist Shinobu.<br />
<br />
Still a very good and recommendable series, but very different in tenor than the original.

    Some increased schizophrenic pacing and frustrating storytelling lead to an experience that is slightly less satisfying than the first season. Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181593">
        rhythm and tone of the readers and the game overall, it was a really engaging experience. The characters develop well but I would have liked to see them go just a bit further. I will likely dig up the manga on this one, I think this series would be much better had I read the manga first.

    Wow, just wow - what a series. In this review I&#039;ll be covering both season 1 and 2, since I cannot imagine anyone who has finished season 1 would not immediately rush out and watch season 2. Spoiler free review and thoughts to follow.<br />
<br />
If you ever wanted a sports anime to actually have some romantic elements in it (although fairly subtle/light) then you cant go past this one. It is a top notch sports style anime in the tradition of Haikyuu, Kuroko no Basuke and Hajime no Ippo, just written from a Josei/female protagonist perspectibve. Such a perfect match, with the tension of the games,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213164">
        mixed in with distinctive likeable and diverse cast and such strong character development. <br />
<br />
You can&#039;t help but fall in love with each and every character. You will laugh with them, feel their pain and joy and just have such a good feels trip watching this series. As they grow through failure and defeat, you will share their bond and savour their victories and successes.<br />
<br />
The art is top notch with great character design and a beautiful colour palette. There is some slightly distracting CG sequences but I honestly didn&#039;t mind it too much. The music, OP and ED pieces suited the show perfectly. I loved all 4 pieces. I also loved the seiyuu who played Chihaya - just a beautiful voice. If you enjoy a classical type of voice, in some ways like Hayami Saori - both spoken and singing voice you&#039;ll enjoy this performance.<br />
<br />
The only downside as is typical in josei, rather than sports anime is the open ending. I have yet to see a series that just ends with some closure - perhaps because the manga is actually still ongoing. I can only hope that a season 3 is produced at some stage. <br />
<br />
So what are you waiting for? One of my favourite anime, easily top 5 in any list of sports anime out there. Watch this one. Highly recommended.

    ちはやふる 2 is a charming sequel to the popular first season. A truly captivating show and a very successful mix of the sport genre, with exciting competitions and the subtle sophistication of the Shoujo genre through friendship bonds. If you enjoyed the first season, this gentle, yet passionate continuation of sport and drama is sure to appeal to you too.<br />
<br />
Story: funny - doing the same thing, but a bit different (9/10)<br />
In the first season, the story is in the foreground and introduces both the characters as well as the traditional Karuta. Now that we know the setting and the characters a little better, story and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337839">
        plot take the opposite path, and that is exceptionally well done, by the way. What I really appreciate about this sequel is that the plot is emphasized but not in the foreground. The pleasant pace also gives each character enough time to develop their own convincing and interesting personality, which was created for them in the first season. The common thread of the story ties in seamlessly with its predecessor. The series shows how all the members of the Mizusawa Karuta Club prepare for the group tournaments and the individual matches. Its their second year and they have trained hard for a long time. Chiyaha has high goals for all members as well as for herself. There are nice side stories, such as gaining new members and a reunion with an old friend will also be included. Everything garnished with all kinds of small and bigger obstacles as well as exciting matches, with opponents who are up to the challenge. So it will be exciting!<br />
<br />
Characters: The characterization &amp; the bond of friendship are brilliantly deepened (9/10)<br />
One reason why the series is so much fun is the passion that every member of the team has for Karuta, as well as their very different personalities. They complement each other and yet sometimes they quarrel. Now, new characters are added in this nice mix. The main cast only briefly, because in my first season review I already described them a little, but a few words more about the new characters.<br />
Hanano, Sumire:<br />
Her character is a good example that a book should not be judged by its cover. The first impression is superficial, vain and her main concern is to find a good-looking friend quickly. It is obvious who is the right candidate in her eyes. She is direct and doesn&#039;t mince her words, but nevertheless it quickly becomes clear that there is more behind it than the sometimes wayward nature and sarcasm. Her jealousy also shows a sensitivity, and some of the Hyakunin Isshu&#039;s poems can affect her. Give her some time and I am sure that a very nice scene with Kanade will reward you for it and that a little light of sincere interest and responsibility will shine through.<br />
Tsukuba Akihiro:<br />
Also the second new addition, is a bit strange. Actually, Akihiro is a nice guy, if it weren&#039;t for his imposing behavior and his pride, which at first glance seems unjustified and exaggerated. He is talented and has already successfully played a local subspecies of Karuta in his home community. However, his exaggerated ambitions drives him to use underhanded methods to achieve his goals. His skills cannot yet match his ambitions, but once again it is clear that the Mizusawa team is indeed a team and will integrate his skills.<br />
Ayase, Chihaya:<br />
A gracious, quirky, a little stubborn karuta enthusiast who alone makes the show worth seeing. She is the driving force and also provides much of the comedy. On the other hand, her straightforwardness and honesty are also the backbone of the team.<br />
Ooe, Kanade:<br />
Kanade is the best example of the series&#039; clear connection to the reality in which we all live. She is not a catwalk beauty, like many of the other characters, but a sweet, wonderful, kind, brilliant girl with a big heart and a lovely soul. Her character can also develop in regard to the first season. Her great passion for Japanese poetry is further strengthened in her effort to read the verses aloud.<br />
Komano, Tsutomu:<br />
A very similar fate is shared by Komano, who may not really correspond to male ideals of beauty, but who is blessed with an excellent mind and understanding that will show him completely new ways in human terms. He develops new skills and refines his style. In my opinion, his development is particularly well designed. He realizes his progress with realistic speed and convincing abilities that fit his character type well.<br />
Nishida, Yuusei:<br />
Nishida is also not a representative of an ideal of beauty, but I have perceived his character as particularly positive and he also has a lot of experience in Karuta. Similar to Komano, he has a very good ability to observe, which enables him to recognize and analyze the movements and the way of playing in combination with his knowledge of Karuta. Already in the first season it showed that he has team spirit. He tries to realize his personal dream, but when the going gets tough, he stands by his comrades.<br />
Especially nice compared to the first season is the variety of capable opponents.<br />
<br />
Visuals: As the first season, the art is very pleasant &amp; animation good, but a little inconsistent (8/10)<br />
The sequel is still strong in terms of production values and diversity of character. The character design is excellent, especially with regard to the three main characters. One is attracted by the beautiful faces and especially the eye areas with their richness of detail give them a very appealing charm and a special highlight. The adaptation of the wonderful manga by Suetsugu, Yuki was well done by the art department. Despite the emphasis on attractiveness, the series remains aesthetic and realistic. One can now object that not all the characters looked so appealing, and that&#039;s not entirely wrong, but it underscores the reality. Not all people have a beautiful appearance, but that makes nature up in other ways. I already explained this thought in the character descriptions. A graceful detail of the art that was already used in the first season are the charming accents that underline the shoujo character, such as falling sakura leaves and soft pastel- colour tones. Another nice side effect of the target group &quot;shoujo&quot; is, that one waits in vain for awkward action sequences, unaesthetic fan service, and in addition, the chibi effects are used rarely and pointed.<br />
The movements of the individual Karuta players in the tournaments are smooth and with the very good camera work, every match is incredibly exciting. In addition, the camera angles are perfectly matched to the panning and tilting movements to get a great shot of every card played and get the maximum effect out of every scene. The animation in the tournaments is a pleasure, but there is an imbalance to the normal scenarios of the series, so that the impression of inconsistency arises. This is hardly noticeable because the captivating characters are artfully staged, especially in the scenes that do not contain dialogues and you can only hear their thoughts. It is also apparent that the depictions that are a bit more distant are less detailed. I know, it&#039;s lamenting at high level, but Madhouse has the skills and abilities to provide that level.<br />
<br />
Music: emphasized in the right way without exaggeration, good VA &amp; OP / ED (9/10)<br />
The background music was composed by Yamashita, Kōsuke, and adapts very well to the emotions of each scenario, without sliding too much into the sentimental. The way in which the musical arrangements harmoniously emphasize the overall picture of the series is impressive and creates just the right mood for the audience.<br />
In addition, the series receives a very nice OP as well as very appealing Eds.<br />
The OP is again from 99RadioService and is entitled STAR. The music is a little less rock than the OP from the first series and sounds a bit more mature. The lyrics fit very well with their reference to feelings and promises from the past. The animation for the music is structured similarly to the first season and shows places, people and offers a foretaste of what will follow.<br />
The ED of episode 1-24 is the title &quot;Akanezora&quot; and is sung again by Seiyū Seto, Asami. It is a soulful and beautiful song about a romantic autumn walk and the memory of a loved one. The song is carried by Seto-san&#039;s voice and has a wonderful tempo. The animation is moodily chosen and brings the memory to life by turning back the time from teenagers to carefree childhood and showing the three friends together.<br />
The ED title from the first season &quot;Soshite Ima&quot; by Asami SETO was also played in the second season as an insertion song in ep 20.<br />
In the last episode the title &quot;youthful&quot; is chosen again as ED, I love this outstanding song.<br />
The dialogues are consistently clear, the sound is balanced between music and dialogues. In addition, the pleasant animation of the Karuta matches is enhanced by a beautiful stereo effect that even makes the tension audible.<br />
Among the Seiyū, I noticed Kayano, Ai as the spokeswoman for Ooe, Kanade. I like her pleasant, gentle, yet passionate way of speaking the poems.<br />
As in season one, Ishizuka, Unshou&#039;s voice is one of those that caught my eye (ear). I like his interpretation of the role of Harada, Hideo, with his deep voice and paternal severity in his tembre.<br />
And this time I will also praise Hosoya, Yoshimasa, for his performance as the voice of Wataya, Arata. I wanted to do that in season one because he did it very well, unfortunately I forgot it last time. His dialect (Fukui-Ken) is very different from standard Japanese. However, some words are similar to Kansai-ben and sound nice and friendly to me. I&#039;m weird, I know -_o <br />
I haven&#039;t written anything about subtitles in my reviews yet, so I decided to add it. The subs are timely and error-free, but you should be aware that sometimes a wall with subtitles is displayed, so you will soon be very familiar with the pause button. <br />
<br />
Chihayafuru 2, straight to the point, it&#039;s definitely worth seeing. The second season reached the splendor of the first season. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason not to see this show. It convinces with great characters, good art and animation, an elegant and very appealing sports anime, which merges with a really well done soundtrack to a great overall picture.<br />
I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching.

    This is my first ever review and this might not be as helpful.. Hehe.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
<br />
I think that the plot was amazing!! It was very unique and very interesting. I&#039;m not very interested in animes that involves sports but this was a very fantastic anime and I just loved it. I rated it a nine because it was ALMOST perfect. The story could be a bit slow and drags through out the episode and just cuts off to the very exciting part, then the episode ends, leaving you eventually hanging. Cliffhangers pretty much on every episode and I would always check everyday to see if there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review101193">
        was a new episode!! <br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
HOLY MOLY!! Their eyes are amazingly gorgeous!! Especially Taichi&#039;s ^_^! I just love the animation and like I said, their eyes. Chihaya is freaking beautiful, and Taichi is FLIPPING hot. I love these kind of Art. It somehow reminded me of Kimi Ni Todoke, just a bit.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
The sound was not much of a big deal to me but I think that the sounds were pleasing.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, the characters were very lovable and inspirational. But what irritated me a bit is that I really wanted things to happen between the main three characters Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata. But then Chihaya is waaaay too into karuta. But I guess it&#039;s not the anime producers fault since the anime was not listed in the romance genre.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Even though there weren&#039;t any romance, I wanted to have atleast a bit of signs of pairings in this anime. I do ship TaichixChihaya ALOT but I am also considering about shipping ArataxChihaya. I really like this anime. I enjoyed every bit of it, watching this anime wanted me to play Karuto soooooooo bad!!-_- It looks really fun and I grew interest in it!o: <br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
Just an outstanding anime. I&#039;m really glad that I found this anime and watched it.

    Chihayafuru season 1 and 2 are a rather strange phenomena for me. When I read the show description back in my pubescent days I was disgusted. What a silly sounding show I thought. I&#039;d seen the good reviews and knew people liked it, but it celebrated such a bizarre piece of Japanese culture that I found my British mind struggling to grasp at the idea of a competitive game involving poems being enjoyable. But colour me as pink as Taichi&#039;s hair I was an immediate convert! This show is a shoujo claymore, cleaving you with it&#039;s girly aesthetic till you are but paste on the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review367378">
        ground. It&#039;s lavish and gorgeously romantic and the main character is a pretty girl with a rock for a brain. What a mysterious female fantasy... This show definitely wasn&#039;t a favourite on first watch - some of the matches can feel like they drag, and actually understanding the game they are playing is nigh on impossible due to it&#039;s reliance on kanji. But if someone could sample those poems being sung out in this anime and put it on their mix tape, I&#039;d be your first buyer. I&#039;ve watched both seasons of this anime enough that each climactic moment makes me tear up and the shows run time just breezes past because it&#039;s familiar and homely.  This is never a story that you would see outside of anime/manga and it&#039;s outstanding. I love it deeply.

    Finally...Chihaya&#039;s second journey is over.<br />
My initial response was this; who&#039;d have thought that an &quot;old&quot; element such as karuta would produce two masterpiece animes? Indeed, who huh. If I did, I&#039;d have gone and taken all the credits. Ah well.<br />
I have written the review for Chihayafuru as well, and when I did, I was quite glad that the second season had begun as soon as I had finished the first season. Pretty fortunate of me if you asked.<br />
Now that I talk about this, let me just tell a little story about my God-given timing. For those who haven&#039;t seen Steins; Gate, just ignore this and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review105157">
        go to the review written below.<br />
My brother is also an anime lover (He&#039;s not really Otaku...cuz, well, he&#039;s not that serious) and told me to watch Steins; Gate if I didn&#039;t want my life wasted.<br />
However, I fell asleep right at the end and told my brother that STEINS GATE WAS BORING. (Blasphemy! Burn him! oh wait I said it...)<br />
My brother was shocked. &quot;It was? But...there&#039;s no way!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah it was boring. It was so boring that I slept.&quot;<br />
&quot;....When did you fall asleep?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right after the elevator opened and there was a blinding light.&quot;<br />
My brother cried out of my God-given timing. He asked, almost begged me to watch the after of that blinding light. I got annoyed and watched it after two days.<br />
&quot;Yeah, he got the mail. Yeah he&#039;s kinda distressed. See, elevator open......................................&quot;<br />
I finished it in one day. I slept only 2 hours that day.<br />
Haah......<br />
Anyways, I loved Chihayafuru, so I was pretty certain that I was going to love this one too. However......I don&#039;t know why, but I just don&#039;t get that feeling I got from finishing first season.<br />
<br />
*Minor Spoiler*<br />
Maybe it&#039;s just because I&#039;m pro-Mashima, but I didn&#039;t like where the story was going for this one...or maybe I&#039;m solo...(sob)<br />
*End of Spoiler*<br />
<br />
Still I enjoyed the second season to much of my part. It was weird for me to sweat cold sweats from just watching anime. That never happens....right?<br />
Well, anyways, let me start with the review.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
To see the reason, just go to the bottom and read the last paragraph. Just make sure your hands are empty cuz you might throw them into the monitor.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
Need a question? Really, the story was so densely packed and perfectly  fitted that I was swallowing my saliva from just watching them. And mind you, I was watching this in my school, with a teacher behind me. The way the author creates a godly suspense and &quot;event&quot; after another made me almost spew my heart out (means my heart was thumping too fast in my country&#039;s dialect). I really didn&#039;t like where the romance seemed to go, but still this is another way of capturing audience, so I will allow it....probably.<br />
Speaking of romance, the romance did elaborate itself more in this season than the last one, and, according to other reviews, ideas are pretty much divided with romance being an important part of story and unnecessary &quot;annoying&quot; part of the story. However, I don&#039;t see why romance can be annoying to some people. Chihayafuru was never a series of karuta battles. It was a development of a character who likes karuta. If the author wanted to show karuta over the development of the story, the author would&#039;ve created a shounen anime that illustrates the epic sportiness of karuta. That wasn&#039;t the case. The author wanted to develop both Chihaya and karuta. Either was important. Moreover, since romance became a strategy to develop karuta, it was never an annoying factor.<br />
Simply put, don&#039;t underestimate the power of love.........huh?<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
Loved it, I&#039;ll admit. However, I didn&#039;t quite get the feeling I got from watching season one. The first season was as if I was in naniwa river, listening to the beautiful melodies of the certified karuta reader, looking into the blooms of &quot;such blooming autumn red&quot;. For this one......I don&#039;t know, it felt a little too rushed. It was as if the anime production studio was no longer focused on its aesthetic beauty and more on the production benefits. In other words, while the first season&#039;s art felt like a beautifully designed katana that took years to finish, the second season&#039;s art felt more like mass-produced katana. It felt too &quot;artificial&quot; (I&#039;m putting quotation because it is really artificial).<br />
Of course, I can&#039;t be biased and say that the art was artificial for all of the anime. It was near the end I felt this &quot;artificialness&quot; As mentioned earlier, the production profit had a lot to do with it.<br />
Still, the art was lovable...just not as much as the previous.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Although I haven&#039;t said it, I have three musical talents: absolute pitch, perfect memorization and tuner pitch. Most people are probably aware of the first term, but maybe not the second and third, because they are terms I just came up with. First, absolute pitch is ability to tell the pitch of the sound with just hearing. Second, perfect memorization (which I came up with) is 1) ability to memorize song fastly or 2) ability to memorize every single details of the song in a short period of time. Fortunate or not, I&#039;m both (I say &#039;or not&#039; because when I memorize a song--be it a sexual song or political song--I never forget it). I consider, therefore, sound aspect of an anime quite seriously. I don&#039;t live in Japan, and so do not really care about the background or the adversary of the anime, but I do care about sound quality. In the first season, I gave ten for the sound because of its dramatic timing and proper tune. For this season too, I would have given a ten if not for two things--one, the ending doesn&#039;t fit to karuta. The ending of the first season is so loveable that I listen to it even now. It might be because I&#039;ve never listened to the full version of the song, but the song was in six eights, giving it a rather upbeat rhythm. It was not something you&#039;d want to give as an ending for a traditional anime such as chihayafuru. I&#039;m not saying that I didn&#039;t like the music. I just mean that the song didn&#039;t fit the occasion. Opening too, was rather irritating. If there is one thing I hate the most, it&#039;s ruining the song of a good singer because of the horrible tune he/she sings. Imagine LiSA or linked horizon singing hare hare yukai. Does it ever fit? The singer for Icon/Takaroni has a wonderful voice and I like how he mild out his voice when he reaches a high tune to give a peaceful melody, very much like karuta. This song wasn&#039;t as bad as LiSA singing hare hare yukai, but it was like her singing crossing field. Crossing field is a good song...at the start. However, it ruins itself at the climax by repeating G and A. Repetition of a short melody is NEVER a good idea. When Chihayafuru II did the same thing...I almost threw the computer away. The chord didn&#039;t fit or have complete coherence to each other.<br />
Another thing I didn&#039;t like was the BGMs. I didn&#039;t expect the second season to have a completely different sound from the first season. Still, the BGMs were exactly the same! I wanted to hear at least one or two new rhythms. Listening to same BGMs for nearly 50 episodes is both boring and tiresome. Also, the dramatic timing and appropriate choice of sound was a little flawed. It&#039;s not that it was no longer there, but it was that compared to the first season second season had less dramatizing by sound.<br />
...A little disappointed I was.<br />
Still, this could only apply to me, so rather than giving my desired score, I compensated it with 8. After all, not many audiences are as hard on BGMs and op/eds as I am.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Chihayafuru did it again.<br />
One thing I said while writing the review for the first season is that greatest animes rarely have extras. Another thing I haven&#039;t said is that I am also a writer and I don&#039;t like any of my characters being heard for ten seconds and no more. Chihayafuru, of course, had such characters, but that was natural, given the genre of the anime. This isn&#039;t exactly shounen. However, all the characters who had been named were developed wonderfully. For example, Retro (he might have different name in accordance to the tlr) deployed some beautiful scenes that, I can almost say, was main-characterish. He is an obvious minor character, but the words he used and ideals he had touched me and changed the anime as a whole. An anime with all the characters getting involved...now we don&#039;t get to see those too often, do we.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
What can I say? It&#039;s karuta. It&#039;s more breathtaking than watching boxers kill each other.<br />
<br />
For all of you who came all the way down here, I just wanted to tell you something; I don&#039;t write as much in aspects with high scores because I don&#039;t see the need to elaborate on it. While it&#039;s true that I have to explain the reason for their high scores, it is very difficult to elaborate on their outstanding quality without spoiling. So...sorry, but.<br />
JUST WATCH IT. IT&#039;S GREAT, I&#039;M TELLING YOU.

    I don&#039;t usually write reviews on MAL ever, but this show just... It just needs it. If you&#039;re about to watch this show, you&#039;ve already seen the first season so I&#039;ll just skip on the contents and go straight to what makes Chihayafuru 2 amazing.<br />
<br />
This show is just consistently great. The character interactions and development is top notch. There is never any downtime and any time spent on any character or event has a purpose. The characters feel genuine and they feelings really permeate through to the viewer. The karuta matches are tense and no outcome is ever predictable, making for a very enjoyable watch.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103011">
        Even then, when the focus is not put on the karuta matches, you&#039;re never left waiting for another one to begin since there&#039;s always something interesting going on between the characters.<br />
<br />
While this show doesn&#039;t have extreme heights, it never has any lows and just consistently gets better every episode. Everyone I&#039;ve recommend to watch this and the first season have enjoyed it thoroughly. I do believe that this is one of the best anime to have been made in the recent years and I give my regards to Madhouse who&#039;s made this and quite a few other amazing anime all possible.
