    Raising a child isn&#039;t easy, and every parent or guardian knows just how taxing all of the daily tasks can be, the sacrifices that need to be made in terms of work and social life, and the almost constant stream of considerations and worries. The truth is that looking after children is one of the biggest causes of stress and grey hairs (or hair loss), amongst adults, but given that the majority of people in the world are (or will be), parents, it&#039;s a little odd that such a major topic is still a rarity in anime.<br />
<br />
The again, who wants to watch a show about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review44359">
        the trials and tribulations of raising children, especially when the steady diet of fanservice, explosions, brainless muscular heroes, top heavy heroines, nonsensical plots, pseudo-psychology, quantum-hokum, etc, are apparently what passes for entertainment these days. It&#039;s a sad fact that in a medium where literally any story can be told, the ones that may actually cast anime in a positive light are constantly overlooked or ignored completely.<br />
<br />
Which is why Usagi Drop is such a rarity.<br />

Adapted from the josei manga by Unita Yumi, the story begins with Kawachi Daikichi, a 30 year old salesman who has returned home to attend a family funeral. During his stay he finds out that his deceased grandfather had an illegitimate daughter called Kaga Rin. Nobody knows who the girl&#039;s mother is, so the family begin arguing over who will raise her until Daikichi, who has become increasingly annoyed and disgusted by their behaviour, asks Rin if she wants to live with him.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop is one of those uncommon adaptations where the anime has tried to stay true to the source material, and while that does place a number of limitations on it, the series also manages to retain the charm of the manga. The story develops at a measured pace that can sometimes feel a little slow, and there&#039;s a surprising lack of over the top melodrama that is so often a hallmark of shows like this. The plot takes a much more mature approach to the issue of parenting than one might initially expect, and while certain problems that Daikichi is faced with are specific to Japanese society, the overall theme is one that will resonate with anyone who has raised children.<br />
<br />
Which is also the reason why some viewers may not enjoy this anime, but we&#039;ll get to that in a bit.<br />
<br />
In addition to the story, the artwork also tries to stay as true as possible to the source material. The characters are depicted in a stylized form, and the rather simplistic approach to emotions is surprisingly expressive. The design is focused on showing each person as an individual not only facially, but also in their build, posture, and even their movements. The animation is fluid, if a little utilitarian at times, and it&#039;s clear that attention has been paid to each character&#039;s physical traits and personalities. In addition to this each episode is preceded and concluded by short, but rather charming scenes that are notable for the watercolour style palette that is used in them. The dichotomy between these scenes and the style and colouration used in the main body of the narrative adds a nice, almost picture book touch to proceedings.<br />
<br />
Between these shorts and the story proper lie the opening and ending sequences, both of which are designed with children&#039;s paintings in mind. The opening theme, &quot;Sweet Drop&quot; by Puffy AmiYumi (yes, they of Teen Titans and Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi fame), is a surprisingly well suited J-pop song that&#039;s very much in keeping with Rin&#039;s character. In contrast to this the ending theme, &quot;High High High&quot; by Kasarinchu (a pop duo consisting of a beatboxer and a guitarist/singer), is more reflective of the overall atmosphere of the series.<br />
<br />
As for the background music, Usagi Drop features a variety of tracks that are generally quite mellow or upbeat, but every so often the score is punctuated by a slow, simple piano piece to highlight the more sensitive moments of the story.<br />
<br />
Now it&#039;s a trite thing to say that good acting can bring any type of story to life and give it the feeling of something new and different, but in this case it&#039;s actually a true statement. The simple yet natural script allows the seiyuu far more room to express themselves than one might expect, and with little in the way of manufactured melodrama, all of the cast (especially the child actors), are able to deliver some truly worthwhile performances.<br />
<br />
The most interesting character in Usagi Drop is, without a doubt, Kawachi Daikichi. Part of the reason for this is because much of the story is told from his perspective, but he&#039;s also one of the most defined adult male leads in anime to date. From the start he is shown to be a complete individual with his own thoughts, habits and values, and rather than trying to develop him, the narrative is more focused on evolving him through his relationship with Rin, and the problems, worries and sacrifices he works through in order to be a good parent.<br />
<br />
On the other hand Rin is very much how one would expect a child of her age to be - inquisitive, precocious, and somewhat withdrawn around people she doesn&#039;t know well. As with Daikichi, she doesn&#039;t really develop as a character, but instead what the viewer is shown is a little girl who is slowly coming to terms with her new life and coming out of her shell. Now this is surprising as it&#039;s a clear message about how resilient children actually are and how they are able to cope as long as they know they have the support of the adults who care for them.<br />
<br />
Speaking of support, aside from the two leads there are a surprising number of well written characters in Usagi Drop, both adults and children, and it&#039;s their presence in the story that really rounds out the whole thing. The particularly strong friendship between Nitani Kouki and Rin for example, or the slightly befuddled attraction between Daikichi and Kouki&#039;s mother Yukari, all add to the overall charm of the series. In addition to this, one of the things that really stands out about Usagi Drop is the lack of angst where relationships are concerned. While there are events like the death of Daikichi&#039;s grandfather, these don&#039;t cast a pall over the narrative, and this allows for some interesting interactions and dynamics to emerge, the prime example of this being the bond that develops between the two lead characters.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop is a simple, straightforward and charming tale about what it means to be a parent, and while the story and characters are presented in an ideal form, this doesn&#039;t really detract from one&#039;s enjoyment of the show. It goes without saying that anyone who has experience of raising children will be able to relate more readily to a number of the themes in the show, but it should be pointed out that the plot is simple enough to allow anyone to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to why some people won&#039;t like this series.<br />
<br />
Aside from the sometimes slow pace, the main theme of the show is one that many younger fans (and even a few older ones), may not like, especially if their penchant is for action, heavy melodrama, etc. On the surface it can seem as though Usagi Drop is nothing more than another lighthearted slice of life drama that&#039;s only different from the likes of Aishiteruze Baby because a full fledged adult is cast in the role of parent instead of a teenaged playboy, but there&#039;s more to the show than that.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that this anime is one of those rare titles that doesn&#039;t use the word &quot;mature&quot; as a marker for violence, gore, sexual content, etc, and this makes it almost unique when one considers the shows that have been released this past year. The emphasis on realism, albeit in an idealized form, may also be a factor as there are a few people out there who want pure fantasy and escapism.<br />
<br />
Whatever your opinion or taste, one thing remains true - Usagi Drop is clearly aimed at a more mature audience than the norm. The fact that it doesn&#039;t demean the creators with pointless gore, violence or fanservice, or insult the viewer&#039;s intelligence by explaining everything that happens, are what sets it apart from many other slice of life shows out there.

    “Daikichi… Daikichi, wake up.” <br />
<br />
“…mmhhh… Yes.”<br />
<br />
I’m happy. Why? Well, because this show did so much right that it’s tough not to be. Usagi Drop stayed true to the essence of the manga (before the timeskip) and didn’t stray far, if at all, from the original story progression. It captured splendidly the little nuances of an abnormal parent-child reality.<br />
<br />
Our lives are full of insignificancies. Waking up irritable and half alert, washing your teeth, brushing your face, fumbling to find your valuables, grocery shopping without a list. The shit we wade through daily but clean up and forget soon after. These are experiences almost all can relate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43431">
        to but never share with one another because it’s stuff not worth sharing. Then of course, spliced in between those bits of irrelevance are the undoubtedly meaningful moments to be remembered. And we want to save those precious moments by documenting them. It’s in our nature to try and preserve the best times of our lives in some form or another. So when something like Usagi Drop comes along that personifies ‘life’, in both the boring and the beautiful, we’re able to really connect with the characters and their story on a more personal level. <br />
<br />
Rin is modest, caring, independent, and responsible. She’s very mature but then not without those traits which you find ever-present in kids around her age. Joyful, curious, and downright adorable! In terms of lovability, she’s on par with Ushio in my book. You just want to squeeze those little cheeks and embrace her till she dies of asphyxiation. She’s that HNNNGGable. Needless to say, her expressions are genuine signs of love and appreciation, even for something like a poor attempt at tying pigtails. How she feels shows on her face clear as a sunny day. And the window through which we get to see all these sides of her is Daikichi.<br />
<br />
Daikichi’s a very straightforward guy, both in personality and appearance. On top of that, he’s nurturing, compassionate, and protective. A little awkward at times but it comes with the job. Not to say I don’t like my dad, I love him, but Daikichi is the kind of father I wished I’d had growing up. He juggles his new responsibilities well with work and still manages to maintain a good relationship with everyone around him. Standing in as a guardian for your past grandfather’s illegitimate kid probably isn’t easy so I think he deserves a break here and there for his goofups. Watching Daikichi is a true breath of fresh air what with all the high school/university kids hogging most of the attention in anime. What you get is a middle aged guy just trying to do his best to provide for himself and his new little house warmer.<br />
<br />
TWO little house warmers considering the frequency of Kouki’s visits. He and his mother are two more people you’ll find to be endearing as they interact with Rin and Daikichi. Aside from his apparent cheekiness, Kouki’s a good kid and it shows in his submissive yet protective behavior towards Rin. Looking at their close friendship and the overt chemistry between Yukari and Kawachi, it’s quite easy to envision them becoming a family in the near future. In fact, beyond the show’s conclusion you could say they’re already family.<br />
<br />
And because of the relatively fluid art and animation, we’re able to see how they become so close. Soft watercolour-esque scenes start out each episode before the opening song rolls. It’s really a nice way of preceding the bulk of the episode. Character designs are markedly simplistic but there’s no need to fuss over it. With some added touches of realism, it’s nice knowing they do change clothes each day and night and that Daikichi does grow a stubble if he doesn’t shave every day like any other grown man. The backgrounds are subtle yet detailed; from pavement cracks to packaged market meat, everything in view is easy on the oculars.<br />
<br />
To supplement the animation is the writing which shines through in the dialogue. Ayu and Tsuchida’s performance as the voices of Rin and Daikichi leave little more to be asked for. Thanks to them and all the other seiyuus, the talking that goes on in the show becomes one of its strengths. For example, in one episode, Daikichi and Harumi, Reina’s mom, have a serious discussion about Harumi’s marital problems which is eavesdropped on by Rin. But noticing this, Reina takes her aside and shows her how she copes when mom and dad don’t get along. Not something seen every day, you get both the child and parent’s perspectives of when things aren’t going so smoothly at home. Really, kids are keen in times like that and it’s great to see that the anime picks up on this detail. And it’s not only those I’ve listed who have depth of character but everyone has their own charm about them and grows, if just a little, in their own way in the span of only a year.<br />
<br />
Now soundwise, the piano melodies and environmental acoustics fit well with whatever present surroundings were onscreen. The opening/ending songs are two very cheery jingles. Catchy it was but not enough to my taste to warrant a replay every week. Though, I would’ve never known that the group who did the opening is the same group who did the Teen Titans theme song (one of my favorites) had I not looked it up. Nostalgia, woo! From their tower they can see that all together, the music worked in pacing the way scenes played out.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop was an engagingly heartfelt tale of an atypical family living and learning how to adjust to their odd circumstances and the intricacies it affords. It handled themes like the importance of family values and the trials of child raising with great consideration for its audiences. <br />
<br />
Despite its title I advise against dropping this anime because sitting down to watch Rin and Daikichi go through child/parenthood is an experience to be cherished. And I, for one, certainly have.<br />
<br />

    Secretly funded by the Japanese government to combat declining birth rates, project &quot;USAGI DROP&quot; targeted a very specific, generally non-reproductive demographic of the Japanese population: the otaku. At the core of the project was a 11 episode television series that was specifically designed to thoroughly rouse hibernating paternal instincts. Researchers noted a 41% increase in the desire to have children in males in their 20s to 30s who watched a single episode of Usagi Drop. Researchers also noted that of that 41%, 77% of those males explicitly stated that they wanted daughters. One of the biggest advantages project USAGI DROP had over its predecessor, project

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46997">
        MINDLESS ECCHI is that it instilled the desire to propagate in its viewers rather than the desire to merely fornicate. Researchers of the project also documented what later became termed as the &quot;Usagi Drop effect;&quot; after watching an episode of Usagi Drop, viewers would often ramble off a list of random names before being able to engage in proper conversation. After a conducting several widespread interviews, researchers discovered that these ramblings were the external symptoms of an internal debate that was common among all viewers of Usagi Drop; the viewers consistently tried to decide what name they wanted to bestow on their offspring after watching an episode of Usagi Drop. After these very promising test results, the Japanese Government gave the project the green light and the anime aired in the Summer of 2011. They are expecting great returns in nine months.

    I have watched every single slice-of-life anime since 2005 and Usagi Drop still manages to easily stand out. A good amount of slice of life shows focus on pumping high school girls full of moe and or filling their daily lives with excessive drama and irrationally difficult people. Usagi Drop, however, portrays itself in stark contrast; unforced, un-contrived, and totally natural, the show manages to make its characters and events truly heartwarming without having to resort to overcoming some out-of-place difficulty or killing off characters.<br />
<br />
Now more than half-way into the season at episode 6, all the characters have managed to display a definite depth of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39739">
        personality and emotion that most other shows never achieve. Daikichi, his mom, his sister, Rin, Haruko, and even the controversial Masako all refuse to be classified down into silly anime stereotypes. Though they each have their own problems in life, they all manage to radiate a heartwarming and real aura. In their actions and words the mature audience can easily spot a heartfelt kindness and the tender je ne sais quoi of life. The characters are, in fact, more than just characters in some story.  <br />
<br />
And although Usagi Drop still holds an intrinsically touching storyline, it delivers it in pleasant harmony with its characters, its art, and its background music. The audience is transported into the somewhat daunting life of a single Japanese salary-man and sudden father. Yet despite this bleakness, we see the world of Daikichi and Rin as a place filled warmth and a firm sense of family. The chorus of music in the background, neither harkening doom nor hollering gloom, is instead a duet of simplicity, playfulness, and nostalgia. The environmental BGM seeks to neither to overshadow nor contradict the characters, but instead augment gentle Daikichi&#039;s kindness, precocious Rin&#039;s sweetness, energetic Gotou&#039;s friendliness, etc. <br />
<br />
Next, the opening theme, Sweet Drops by Puffy, is a touch of crayon magic mixed with a well-performed song that perfectly captures the pure and innocent love so subtly themed throughout the show. This show is quickly leaving the realm of simple afternoon entertainment and entering the realm of heartwarming artwork.

    To be Frank, I was skeptical about committing to watching Usagi Drop having read all the manga. Adaptations are great and all, but boy oh boy the direction source material (manga) took betrayed my expectations, leaving me doubtful about this as a whole.<br />
<br />
Now, I can safely say I&#039;m glad to have watched this amazing experience. <br />
<br />
So how do I describe and score Usagi Drop? Well, this happens to be one of those shows where numbers just won&#039;t do, and an in-depth analysis is quite frankly overkill. I can talk all I want about the premise, the execution, the pacing; none of this will do it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181577">
        justice. But heck, I&#039;ll give it a shot just for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
We follow our Main &quot;protagonist&quot; Karachi Daikichi, a single 30 year old man whose grandfather has recently passed away. At his grandfather&#039;s funeral, he meets his grandfather&#039;s  daughter, Kaga Rin; age 6. <br />
<br />
Hmm.... Ok... So this little girl is his....<br />
<br />
Moving along, Both the two meet and under the rather dreary atmosphere of mourning adults, Daikichi takes Rin under his wing and thus begins Daikichi&#039;s new life as a parent. <br />
<br />
Pretty basic premise... Meh, not really. Transition into parenting/parenthood is a topic RARELY touched on in anime. Why? Doesn&#039;t sell... Anyways, the story focuses heavily on Daikichi&#039;s and Rin&#039;s new life, how they adapt, perceive, and going about the day. Now remember, Daikichi has been a single 30 year old working and drinking regularly, having only to care and feed for one person. Let&#039;s add another expense to deduct from your income... Don&#039;t forget, kids have soccer (football) games and stuff. Better to make some time in my already dreadfully unflexible schedule..<br />
<br />
Get the picture? Good, but ultimately, the story only moves forward with each new experience both Rin and Daikichi undergo. With that, we see that as time goes on,  they change and develop together.<br />
As far as pacing and progression goes, it&#039;s relatively slow paced... Then again, with an awkward number of 11 episodes, this seems appropriate. Each episode never seems rushed.. Scratch that, each scene never seems rushed. The story isn&#039;t overly complex, so holes aren&#039;t an issue. All in all, the only word to describe the story is simple, and that isn&#039;t such a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Fans could give this a 10, those without a heart could name it plotless. Depending on what you&#039;re expecting, it could go either way.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
This was a surprise considering Production I.G touched this one up. If we look at Production IG&#039;s other works, we see something completely different from what you see here. Please be aware, this is a pleasant surprise. Thumbs up on this one.<br />
<br />
The show comes off as.. Rather childish, but it isn&#039;t that big of a deal considering that kids are involved in the story after all. In fact, the art is rather fitting, and in those few moments throughout the show, I stared in awe at the magnificently drawn and animated scenes. This might be a surprise because the art is so simplistic. Character design, lighting,  the background. Nothing held extraordinary detail except, again, in those few moments of high interest and excitement, although &quot;excitement&quot; isn&#039;t so appropriate to describe this.<br />
<br />
I must compliment the pastel, water color-y (forgive me as I am uneducated in accurate art terminology) scenes through out the series. It&#039;s very different than what many people are probably used to seeing on the current market.<br />
<br />
That being said, because of how boldly the art is presented, the different art style showing off as strongly as it does might end up being a miss for many.<br />
<br />
So how do I sum up the art? Like the story. Simple, but sweet, with a touch of magnificent sprinkled in. It isn&#039;t Shinkai breathtaking, but it is very pretty.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8 <br />
<br />
Character voices are appropriate for the whole cast. I might have a problem with only one character, but she&#039;s completely overlook able in comparison to everyone else. The sound track was well done, though Unmemorable. Heck, everything was done satisfactorily here as the pleasant background music compliments the &quot;feel good&quot; atmosphere. The music even addresses the more dramatic scenes with ease. The OP and ED are nothing too special, but very fitting to the theme of Bunny Drop.<br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
<br />
Now, this may seem like a slice of life show, and it is, but the abnormal time frame this series has may seem rather stressing to many viewers for a variety of reasons. For example, many short series fail to develop their characters since, like in life, time is limited, so you can only dedicate so much screen time to the various resources the director deems necessary.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Usagi Drop nails that instinctive preconception to the ground. With only two main characters and very well-paced story, there is this strong feeling of satisfaction when you watch Rin and Daikichi grow both as individuals and as a family. We even see there is more to the supportive roles than what we are presented with prior to their continued appearances. The show addresses how Daikichi feels and grows quite clearly, which then leads the viewer to imply a few thing about Rin. While Rin arguably is very static in character, we must realize that she is a 6 year old. A child whose mind is still in development. Realistic? Appropriate? Do you have a problem with this ideally perfect little girl? Stuff your whining and refresh your perspectives.<br />
<br />
By the end of the show, I came to realize what a delight It was to watch Daikichi &amp; Rin grow as characters. It made me reflect on how I’ve changed over time as well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
A rare delight and one of the best shows of 2011. It&#039;s hard to explain why this anime was so successful. The story is a heartwarming one, packed with many little lessons on ethics(morals?) and such. Going into the show, you might find plenty of the characters relatable even. Maybe this caused me to reflect on my childhood and outlook for my future. Usagi Drop offers something for everyone to relate to and enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this gave you enough insight as to whether or not you should pick up Usagi drop. Be aware, the intended audience is much older folks (midde-age even), not really specifically targeting teens or young adolescents of the sort. Still, the show is appropriate for a broad audience. If you&#039;re looking for action, harem, an intricate story, you&#039;ll find none of that here. What exists before you is a really simple but sweet treasure. I encourage you to give this show a shot at becoming what could be one of your favorites of all time. My only complaint with Usagi Drop is that it was given a measly and awkward 11 episodes. <br />
<br />
Final thoughts? It was far from perfect, but Usagi Drop did so many things right that it doesn&#039;t even matter.<br />
<br />
I hope this was helpful. <br />
<br />

    To: Anime Fans   <br />
<br />
   Since there is only one episode of this out and I can&#039;t speak for the whole thing, of course, but I do want people to know that this one, so far, is definitely worth watching and why I think in the future it will be well worth your time.<br />
<br />
FIRST RESPONSE (Literally minutes after finishing my first watch through of the first episode. I actually posted it as a comment then copied and pasted it here because I thought it fit well.)<br />
<br />
  Wow, simply beautiful and intriguing, this episode alone could stand on it&#039;s own. I know

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38826">
        there&#039;s going to be more and that awesome but in retrospect it may not, hopefully will though, live up to what this has episode portrayed and what I expect to be the standard for the rest of this anime&#039;s duration. Overall it&#039;s a great set up to what could have a wonderful, touching, deep, story with vivid and evolving characters to bout. But that&#039;s to be seen; for now, my hopes are high.<br />
<br />
   Now for the review portion of this review.<br />
<br />
STORY: I don&#039;t want to say much into this regard as there has been only ONE episode but I can say confidently that it will be good...if not played out, but good never the less. I say this only because I have seen these types of anime before and if the birth mother is ever out of the picture to start then, naturally, she will re-enter the frame. But as a famous quote states, it&#039;s not the path you take but it&#039;s how you walk it. Ok that&#039;s not famous (I actually just made it up) but you get the picture. I read some complaints about how you don&#039;t know enough of the story and how people are feeling lost. My only response to that is...IT&#039;S THE FIRST EPISODE! Give it time. If they revealed all at the start why would you watch it? Suspense is key to good ratings and they know this. I think they did a great job, but I&#039;ll talk about that later.  Moving right along,<br />
<br />
ART: Now I&#039;m no art major nor do I claim or want, no offense, to be one. As a person who can only draw stick figures, anything that has any sembalnce of resembalnce to reality is good (that&#039;s a tongue twister), does that make this anime good? Yes, to me at lest. I have seen plenty of anime and have come across ones that even I don&#039;t care for but the art style here really seems to flow with the feel of this show. It&#039;s calm and smooth. It&#039;s dull and faded. It&#039;s bright and happy. It&#039;s perfect, in my none expert&#039;s opinion. The art will add a level of feeling to the show that mere story or characters could bring (not saying those aren&#039;t equally as important). And so we&#039;re off to the next one,<br />
<br />
SOUND: ...? Um...Hmu.....I...no that&#039;s n...it&#039;s...I...well its sound. I have never really understood this one. The again I watch streaming anime so the sound quality is not on par all the time. But, I expect it&#039;s more for the action animes, the one with a lot going on and what not, but for this anime I am at a lose for words (I know! Me! Well actually you don&#039;t do you? O well) Lets just say the voice acting is stellar, as usual (SUBS NOT DUBS), anyway, the music all fits well, nothing played that seemed out of place or that distracted me in anyway from the anime and the goings ons. Moving ons,<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: Oh My God! (I know who types that out anymore?) That&#039;s just how excited I am to see how these characters will progress! The first episode did an amazing job at setting up each important character. Not letting on to much into anyone&#039;s past but giving enough background information so that you can feel a certain level of understanding towards most of them. Lets go down the list: <br />
  Rin. Quiet and reserved, never went out of here way to defend or react to anything that happened, with one exception. She only had about 4 or 5 lines but actions speak louder then words (who said that? Hold up one second...to Google! Well I heard that Mark Twain said it, also that some old German writer coined it, also that a 5 year old said it as his first words. That was a pointless expedition, lets return to the review, shall we). The one exception that I mentioned earlier...um spoiler I guess...is when Daikichi asks if she wants to live with him and she runs to his side. Can&#039;t wait to see what changes she bring to Daikichi and herself. <br />
  Daikichi. I was having troubles trying to pinpoint his specific character. At first I thought he was a loner and not socially aware, someone who throws them self into there work, that&#039;s how I justified a social loner getting a phone call in the beginning. But he acts and reacts to well in a social setting. So I moved to, not a social loner, but a self proclaimed loner, no matter what, I can tell he is a loner in some form or another. He was always segregated just a little bit from the group, even though they are his family, like sitting away from the table, actually noticing and paying attention to Rin, simple things that are both in his personality and his manner of speech. Cant wait to see how he changes, as fore-mentioned in the paragraph above. <br />
  Haruko. I don&#039;t know why but I feel like she will become an important character later in the show (god I hope I&#039;m not wrong here). I cant say much about her character as she had little lines and even less air time but her presence made an impact on me, though that was probably because her child was quiet prominent. I&#039;m going to go out on a limb and say she will, most likely, be Daikichi&#039;s love interest; however, if they are related disregard all of this. I say this because there was no indication that she was related to Daikichi. I know she has a child but there was not the slightest inkling of mention to a husband. Though it troubles me why she was, at all, at the funeral. Also, Daikichi was caught starring at her. This is what probably peaked my interests. For know just note I said this and disregard it if I&#039;m wrong.<br />
In summary (of the character portion) Rin is quiet, Daikichi a loner, and Haruko possibly a insectual love interest, all show great promise and I cant stress enough how much I can&#039;t wait to see their growth. <br />
<br />
I have high hopes, very high hopes. Don&#039;t let me down Usagi Drop.<br />
<br />
P.S. Rin has the most adult face I have ever seen on an anime child. There normally so bubbly and cute but hers is stern, beautiful and elegant and reminds me of some other female (adult) character I&#039;ve seen somewhere...can&#039;t quiet place it though. Also, disregard the ratings I just thought I had to rate it and it wont let me change it back to nothing so I set them to all 10&#039;s in expectation of my high hopes being fulfilled. <br />
<br />

    God. I suppose this was best time in my life for me to watch this series. I just went through a lot of stress with family and this really helped me understand some of the things that go on when you&#039;re a parent, even a single parent. I&#039;m not gonna say the cliche stuff like &quot;It&#039;s never easy being a parent.&quot; and I can&#039;t say anything from experience, as I am not a father or legal guardian. But I was raised by a single mother without a father in my life until 7 years ago.<br />
<br />
This review is going to differ from my other reviews in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review143149">
        the fact that I can&#039;t really find anything that was wrong with the series. It was cute and it was heart warming. There was no action, that wasn&#039;t what the writer was going for, and that might push a few people away because a lot of people watch anime for an unrealistic story that goes away from what happens in reality. This series provides that realism that is missing in so many other series that I have seen. It is really nice to see a realistic series once in a while. The animation really fit the feel of the series.<br />
<br />
But onto the other aspect that I loved. The characters. Mostly Rin. I loved Rin because i could relate to her. And she has made it up in the list of my favorite fiction characters for that reason. I also loved the Daikichi on the main fact that he took this 6 year old girl, whom he had never met before, into his home and raised her as a daughter. There are other characters I liked. Nitani reminding me of my own mother and Kouski reminding me of a few childhood friends.<br />
<br />
This series really it hit it in the heart for me. It didn&#039;t cry, but I related to a lot of the things that happened in the series.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict:<br />
If you want to watch a heart warming series. Watch this one. It doesn&#039;t have action, it&#039;s not overplayed. And all the characters feel more or less original and human.<br />
<br />
9/10

    Story:<br />
<br />
There really isn&#039;t that much to say about Usagi Drop.It&#039;s a feel-good story about a man rediscovering/ or discovering for the first time on the true joys of life through the child rearing of his adoptive daughter, Rin. There isn&#039;t anything groundbreaking or particularly unique with the plot but it will definitely pull on your heartstrings and you&#039;ll come out out of the series with a simile on your face<br />
<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
The art-style of Usagi Drop is something that follows the original art-style from the manga faithfully and to put it bluntly its unique. Its a style of art different to the trends of modern anime but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173359">
        it has an innocent and whimsical joy that seems to capture the essence of the show . Though beware if you are something who judges an anime but this aspect can be hit or miss. 5/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The Voice-Acting in this is spot-on for Rin, the voice-actor in the Japanese Dub did a fantastic job in capturing the lovable innocence whilst also not giving her that annoying vocal pitch that children tend to have in anime. The other voice-actors were decent, nothing really stood out and they did their jobs. The OP and the ED are adorable, especially that Opening which captures the innocent joy and love between the two main characters. 8/10<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
This is where i think the anime shines. On a technical viewpoint, Usagi Drop is not the an artistic wonder but the characters that have been created and terrific. You feel like all of these characters are real, that their personalities and actions can all be attributed to something someone in that demographic would do. Rin, in my opinion is the stand out character, she mixes in that innocent joy without the grating annoyance of anime children. She simply is a joy to watch 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can&#039;t already tell from my review that I love this anime, then well let me state it a secondary time. I love this anime, I had a great time watching it and its one of the few that I could be bothered to a) Marathon and b) Repeat Watch. Usagi Drop is not a technical masterpiece, don&#039;t watch it for stunning animation, deep philosophical story line or jaw-dropping sound; you watch this for its fleshed out characters and for those moments of just heart-tweaking joy. 9/10<br />

    This is definitely a slice of life anime, yet something is different about it. The style both in the art and story telling is breathtakingly simple. It is the story of a 30 year old man who takes on the task of raising a child. A 6 year old girl no less. The child of his grandfather, his illegitimate child. <br />
<br />
Usagi drop presents us with a very simple yet complicated issue which plagues society daily. How does one deal with a child? How would you raise her and what do you teach her? How do you share memories with them that you do not both

          <span style="display: none;" id="review41303">
        have? Children are smart, they can make a connection if you mention the simplest things, and there is nothing you can hide from them. How do you calm her heart, when she notices that her life is different from her peers? What can you do? This show does not answer these questions, it just makes you wonder more about them. The simple story is sweet and heart felt with every event. One can relate to this child as we&#039;ve all felt the same way when we were children. Will he really be back to pick me up? will i just be abandoned (in this case, again)? What is death? Just like anyone else in the world but a child&#039;s especially, trust must be earned and this is made more complicated in a society where it has become customary to trust no one.<br />
<br />
The art style is simple again just like the story and fits the feel of the show perfectly. The section before the opening theme in every episode is done in a way that feels as though the line art was handed to a child to fill in the colors with her marker set, giving that section a very strong reminiscent feeling.<br />
<br />
The music, consisting primarily of piano solos sometimes accompanied by strings, kicks in at the perfect times fading in and out seamlessly. They are not grand scores but are beautiful nonetheless. At key moments the director sometimes chooses to have the music go silent, leaving only the key background noises and the voices of the characters, and he uses this to great effect. It can be said the music is as light as a child&#039;s emotions, void of the heavy ideals of a grown up, easily carried away by the breeze of the moment.<br />
<br />
Over all this is a very sentimental show, and completely character driven. By it&#039;s nature it is very VERY slow paced, however it would not have the same effect otherwise and i would not have it any other way. As long as you do not mind a slow paced show i recommend this to anyone who likes emotional ones.

    UD is a parenting manual. It is an anime that deals with the issues of raising a kid and how you must pretty much sacrifice everything for it. There are no boobs or giant robots here; this is so much slice of life it is practically bleeding. <br />
<br />
Story: <br />
30-year-old bachelor Daikichi decides to adopt his recently deceased grandfather&#039;s love child Rin as a way of flipping the bird to his snotty relatives. Domestic bliss ensues. <br />
<br />
The story started off very powerfully and was very cunningly adept at tugging on heartstrings the way it portrayed a neglected but very sweet child building a trusting family relationship

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43647">
        with an adult who was clueless about parenting but nevertheless grew to be quite good at it. Then, somehow, each succeeding episode focused more on making a point about how wonderful/terrible parenting is rather than telling a story. Much like real life, the plot shows random stuff happening within the span of a year without much cohesion. While this is not a bad thing per se, the story would have benefited from some sort of conflict and climax. A plot, in short, is missing. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Daikichi is a stoic character taking everything in stride with admirable patience. He is a lovely character to watch as he faces the terrors being a parent: from arranging for daycare to discovering a pool of piss on his bed. His spontaneous act of reckless kindness at the beginning slowly forms into a bond of responsibility with his adopted daughter. His interactions with the other characters make him realise things he had never before thought of. Very solid character development.<br />
Rin is the adopted daughter. Simply put, she is a fictional character. The only way a kid her age could be as cute, polite and sweet is to shoot it full of Valium. Leaving this detail aside, she also has excellent character development. Little by little she is shown to come out of her shell and finally come to trust her substitute parent completely. <br />
Masako is Rin’s biological mother who dumped her. Refreshingly, Masako is not portrayed like a filthy demon from hell but as a real individual. She made her choice and we see her dealing with the consequences. Still, I expected her part to be slightly more important.<br />
Rin’s classmate Kouki &amp; his single mom are pretty much permanent fixtures in Daikichi and Rin’s life. They are a form of mirror to our protagonists, so similar in their single parent family structure yet so very different in character and dynamics. <br />
The rest of the characters are also very realistic. Slice of life up to 11. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: <br />
Excellent animation. Realistic backgrounds, awesome details, very fluid motion. The studio worked their asses off on this one. Also, as a neat bonus, the first minute or so is done in soft watercolour-y style. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Discreet. It underlines the emotional parts and fulfils its function simply and cleanly. <br />
OP &amp; ED: truth be told, they annoyed the hell out of me so I skipped them every single time.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
This is tricky. While I&#039;ve enjoyed this show, its realistic characters and its window into Japan&#039;s family ties it ultimately failed to move me. The first three or four episodes were dynamite but then it fizzed out. Too much moral lecturing on the virtue of sacrifice, too little structured plot. I am glad I watched this but I don&#039;t feel the need to keep this or watch it again. <br />

    Usagi Drop started out as a manga by Unita Yumi. The anime adaptation was handled by Production I.G. It&#039;s also the second Josei series I&#039;ve been asked to review. The other being Nodame Cantabile. Let&#039;s take a look at Usagi Drop and see how it compares.<br />
<br />
The story follows a man named Daikichi who goes to his grandfather&#039;s funeral only to discover that his grandfather had an illegitimate child named Rin. His family treats her like a nuisance, which angers him so he makes a snap decision to take custody of her. You know, like all of those other stories where someone without kids is somehow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98819">
        forced into looking after one. The anime follows the two in their daily lives as they grow closer and as Daikichi uncovers information about Rin&#039;s past. There&#039;s really not much in terms of an actual story. The biggest negative is just that the series is largely boring. A bunch of ordinary events like a kindergarten graduation or visiting family may be a natural part of life, but they don&#039;t make for an interesting or compelling narrative. Not unless there are some really spectacular characters behind them, but I&#039;ll get to that in a bit. The most tension you get is that Rin comes down with the flu for all of an episode. The series tries to maintain a humorous tone most of the time, but most of the jokes aren&#039;t really funny. They&#039;re just like those stories that  some parents tell about their kid doing something kind of stupid that the parent finds hilarious but no one else actually cares about because it&#039;s not really funny but you feel compelled to fake a laugh to be polite. To give the series some credit, there are some cute moments and Daikichi&#039;s search for Rin&#039;s mother is kind of interesting. It also avoids the cheesy romance plot that usually comes with &quot;single person is compelled to look after a kid and discovers the &#039;joys&#039; of parenthood&quot; stories.<br />
<br />
Then we have the characters. The kids in this act like actual children which translates to them being pretty obnoxious most of the time. The only real exception is Rin, who&#039;s, thankfully, the one we spend the most time with. She can be annoying at times, but most of the time she&#039;s mature in enough ways to be tolerable. Most of the adult characters are just kind of boring. They spend a lot of their time focusing on their kids, which kind of reminds me of some people I&#039;ve known who were interesting before they had kids but won&#039;t shut up about their kids now that they&#039;ve had them and aren&#039;t interesting anymore. Now, before you send me a bunch of angry messages, I&#039;m not saying all parents are like that. I&#039;m specifically talking about parents who don&#039;t have interests outside of being parents or don&#039;t seem to since all they ever talk about is their children. <br />
<br />
The art in this is kind of sketchy. The opening scenes for every episode have this kind of chalky unfinished look and then it transitions into a more complete look. Initially I thought that they&#039;d just run out of time and hadn&#039;t been able to completely finish, but after a few episodes it became clear that it was just a very odd stylistic decision. They also have some very strange moments where the character&#039;s faces convert to a very minimalistic style which I think is done as an attempt at humour, but I&#039;m not sure since it can be hard to discern what&#039;s supposed to be funny and what&#039;s just whimsical. The backgrounds tend to be pretty plain. Most of the time the characters and various objects do look pretty nice though. The flora especially. <br />
<br />
The cast in this is decent enough. Although not really anything special. the music is kind enough to play an effect most of the time something funny is supposed to have happened. Which is kind of weird. Did they just know the material wasn&#039;t going to actually be funny and having a character hold a sign saying &quot;laugh&quot; would&#039;ve been too obvious? The music is pretty fitting for the series. It&#039;s slow and soft. <br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 1/10. Most of the focus is on six year olds so it makes sense that there&#039;s not yuri in this. <br />
<br />
So, that&#039;s Usagi Drop. Honestly, I&#039;m not in the demographic for this since my general reaction to children can best be summed up as &quot;meh.&quot; It&#039;s a mostly light-hearted and very dull series. There&#039;s nothing egregiously wrong with it, but you probably aren&#039;t going to be entertained by it unless you really like children. For myself, I give it a 5/10. Meh.

    Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air for those who are a bit tired with the excessive amounts of fanservice, dull characters, and even duller plots that seem to plague the medium. For once we can have an anime that touches upon issues in a serious and honest manner, while having just about the right amount of lightheartedness and humor that prevents the series from getting too heavy. The result is a heartwarming, feel good tale that manages to allow viewers to empathize with the characters and perhaps the show as a whole to be adorable without feeling that they are being insulted.<br />
<br />
Visually, Usagi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43291">
        Drop is pleasing to the eye, and the watercolor style art creates a pretty distinct effect-- it also looks different.  It&#039;s not the most breathtaking artwork out there, but it&#039;s consistent and you never get a feeling of blockiness that tends to happen with the cheaper animated works. It also gives off kind of a nostalgic feeling that makes me feel like I&#039;m watching a family oriented children&#039;s cartoon, but not in a bad way.<br />
<br />
The visuals also go really well with the audio, most notably the opening song Sweet Drops. &quot;Yay, everything is happy and cute&quot; is the mood I get from it. Overall, it&#039;s very upbeat and optimistic<br />
<br />
But while we have this atmosphere of idealism and happiness, the story itself isn&#039;t all just a happy world where nothing can go wrong. Indeed, the very premise is about a child by name of Rin who has no one that wants to take her in, and a lot of her family didn&#039;t even know she existed. It&#039;s a terrible thing for a child to feel unwanted, yet here we have the relatives playing hot potato with a child. On the other hand, taking care of a child isn&#039;t exactly something you can just do, and this is what the story will go on about. Answers aren&#039;t easy and clear cut.<br />
<br />
Enter Dakachi; a man that is still single and has no idea of how to raise a child. Naturally the folks around him aren&#039;t exactly confident, but since he&#039;s the only one that will step up to the plate.<br />
<br />
The anime takes us along with Dakachi and Rin, as well as their friends and family on a journey of growth.  Dakachi must learn to raise Rin, and Rin must learn to recognize this man that just took her in. Naturally it&#039;s not exactly an easy process, and I really enjoyed how gradual the anime made the process. Never has an experience about the typically boring routine of people&#039;s lives been so entertaining.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop isn&#039;t the most exciting of animes, nor is the plot the most complex, but watching the characters gradually develop into people that are more able to handle the difficulties of life makes this an outstanding watch. It truly does justice to the term &quot;Slice of Life&quot;.<br />
<br />
So if you need something a bit different, but is also light and relaxing, I wholeheartedly recommend this. Perhaps it&#039;ll allow you to see anime in a better light, or even be able to share this with other folks without having them look at you funny.<br />

    Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don&#039;t mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters&#039; lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review86807">
        little aspects of ordinary life that make people who they are. Bunny Drop is one such work, and it executes this beautifully. It&#039;s a small, unambitious story about ordinary people but it carries itself with a certain measure of refined dignity that&#039;s rarely seen in anime in general, let alone the slice of life genre. It has genuine insight into parenthood, but it never talks down to its audience and you don&#039;t have to be a parent to get behind the story. This is quite honestly one of the most accessible anime I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
The staff of Production IG handled this show with the sort of nurturing care rarely seen in a slice of life anime, which usually tend to get the short end of the stick production-wise. Backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, colors are warm and rich, and even when the character models go into super-deformed mode (which happens often) movements are fluid and quality control remains excellent. Of particular note are the opening segments of each episode, which are animated in a soft crayon-esque style reminiscent of a children&#039;s storybook. That&#039;s to say nothing of the charming character designs. Every character is distinctive in an understated way that isn&#039;t too far-removed from reality. Family members really do resemble one another (which is especially great since this is a show about family), but not to the point that they could be called carbon copies. The children are cute without defaulting to an overly moe-fied style as Japanese animation is wont to do. This is a spectacular visual effort that sets the tone for the show perfectly.<br />
<br />
The music is mostly comprised of low-key string pieces, and can best be described as charming for its gentle, sincere simplicity. It can get a bit repetitive, a good portion of the soundtrack is comprised of several different instrumentations of the same basic piece, but perhaps due to the series&#039; short length it never wears out its welcome. I&#039;ve seen longer anime get away with worse, so really I have no complaints.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s one thing about anime voice acting in Japan that makes it perfectly suited to this kind of show, and that&#039;s their willingness to fill their child roles with real children. It does happen in the States occasionally (Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist comes to mind immediately) but it&#039;s not nearly as common. Rin, her friend Kouki, her cousin Reina and several minor child characters are all played by age-appropriate voice actors, which makes them sound genuine as only real children can. Ayu Matsuura in particular does a great job as Rin, and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to hear more from her in the years to come as she grows and matures into new roles. The adults sound pretty good too, at least to my ears. The lack of a dub does create a problem for some potential viewers, though, which is unfortunate because otherwise I&#039;m fairly confident I can recommend this series to just about anyone.<br />
<br />
Bunny Drop is first and foremost an emotional series. It&#039;s a pretty consistently upbeat series but it never goes too far into &quot;flowery sunshine and rainbows&quot; territory. This show works because of how true it is to the small, understated moments that a parent and child really do share every day. These moments never feel unnecessary because Daikichi is as new to Rin and to parenting as we are (unless, y&#039;know, you&#039;re already a parent), so we get to discover these things as he does. Both Daikichi and Rin have time to develop in small, believable ways and build a realistic family relationship. Daikichi is always well-meaning, and you never doubt he&#039;s suited to raise Rin, but he does run into a lot of problems that he overcomes with believable difficulty. Rin, meanwhile, is a well-mannered girl who is in some ways wise beyond her years, but she still faces common everyday problems for a child her age like wetting the bed, and she confronts these problems as any child would, so even when she acts a bit old for her age you never forget she&#039;s six. The two of them complement each other sweetly but never come across as saccharine--no small feat. They&#039;re not particularly complex characters, but they&#039;re still charming and memorable, and feel like real people rather than archetypes.<br />
<br />
Actually, &quot;charming&quot;, &quot;memorable&quot; and &quot;real&quot; are good ways to describe the entire cast. From Daikichi&#039;s family to Rin&#039;s playmates, they all act remarkably true to the people we could really meet at these various stages in our lives. The show uses its surprisingly large cast to its full advantage, with every character acting as a foil to Daikichi and Rin in some way or another. For example, there&#039;s Daikichi&#039;s mother Sachiko, who&#039;s already been through everything Daikichi is going through right now, and his sister Kazumi, who&#039;s on the cusp of starting a family of her own. Both of them initially question Daikichi&#039;s decision, but after warming up to Rin and reflecting on their own lives we do see them change for the better in little ways. The lessons are simple but important ones, and they come across naturally through everyday interactions rather than being crammed down our throats.<br />
<br />
If there&#039;s one character in this series who deserves special mention, though, it&#039;s Masako, the mother who abandoned Rin with her father. When Daikichi meets her, she&#039;s nothing like he expects her to be, and it turns out her reasons for leaving Rin are more complex than pure apathy. She&#039;s focused on her own career and not at all suited to being a mother, but despite her efforts to distance herself she can&#039;t help but care about Rin in her own way. She doesn&#039;t feel that she was ready to be a mother, and maybe she&#039;s right, but that doesn&#039;t make her a bad person. That the show managed to portray her in such a light is probably its greatest achievement, and the closest the series comes to delving into the dark side of parenthood. Her character arc is so good, in fact, that it casts the show&#039;s greatest flaw into sharp relief.<br />
<br />
You see, Bunny Drop falls into a bit of a comfort zone, in that it&#039;s severely limited in its thematic and emotional spectrum. Not that it doesn&#039;t bring anything meaningful to the table, but the picture it paints of parenthood is a little too rosy to encompass the full experience. Daikichi never really messes up, the little mistakes he make and the details that slip through the cracks are quickly forgiven and forgotten, and many of the difficulties he and Rin might have to face are discussed but never actually portrayed, such as the possibility that Rin might be teased for her family circumstances. Am I being too cynical? Perhaps, but it&#039;s arcs like Masako&#039;s that prove that the show can strive for something more without sacrificing its purity and sincerity; Masako wasn&#039;t in the right, exactly, but what she did was still understandable, sympathetic even, and it shed light on some truths about parenthood that are rarely addressed. The show needed more material like that, but aside from that one arc and a pretty powerful opening episode (the scene where Daikichi takes Rin home is actually a great moment), Bunny Drop systematically dodged every opportunity to become something more. I mentioned Daikichi&#039;s mother earlier, and on a whole I didn&#039;t dislike her character, but one thing that bothered me was that even after she warmed up to Rin she never apologized for treating her so coldly early on. That&#039;s something the show would have been better for confronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run.<br />
<br />
What we&#039;re left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can&#039;t write it off as meaningless fluff. It does have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it&#039;s true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll on the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps that&#039;s for the best, as I&#039;ve had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but even if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn&#039;t make it good. Not that it&#039;s bad, mind you, it&#039;s certainly better than seeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that&#039;s too bad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series&#039; charming tone, so I can&#039;t fault it too much. Some anime just aren&#039;t meant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good.<br />
<br />
Bunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It&#039;s not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is it the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire show. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe you&#039;ll get more out of it than I did.

    Children are no easy task to take care of. They require a lot of attention and patience to deal with. As a child, I was reckless and very stubborn. I&#039;m glad my parents dealt with me and loved me for who I am. Though when a family member dies, a person can change in a way to make them more secluded and feeling alone, but when someone reaches out to you with love and care, they can change back.<br />
<br />
The story follows a girl named Rin and she was an unknown child belonging to an old man named Souichi and when he dies, she&#039;s left alone.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166477">
        No one wanting to take her into their care knowing the problems a child may cause,  she&#039;s left there not knowing what to do. Angry at their reactions Daikichi, a middle aged man, takes Rin into his care with open arms.<br />
<br />
After the whole affair and Rin starts to live with him, the anime follows their daily lives and the bond that the two start to grow for each other. Over time they begin to have a real father-daughter bond and both love each other greatly. Showing a realistic approach to how children act in this anime, it&#039;s something everyone can relate to and genuine enjoy to watch a family grow and love each other.<br />
<br />
Characters being a key role in any slice of life, this has one of the best character development and realism in each of them. They all have a realistic personality that anyone can relate to such as panicking when their child is ill for the first time, meeting new parents and wishing your kid to have a good day.<br />
<br />
You&#039;re introduced to Rin, a girl who is quiet and shy towards the rest of the family at the start of the anime. Through the bonding with Daikichi and her new parent, she gets to be introduced to each family member along the way and truly starts to love each and one of them as real significant people in her life. She&#039;s a normal girl with trust issues at first and problems that every child goes through, such as wetting the bed. She&#039;s mature for her age, but still childish in many points. <br />
<br />
Next we have Daikichi, he&#039;s a middle aged man who has no experience with children, but takes Rin into his home with open arms and learns as the time goes on. With the role of being a parent, he learns a lot about taking care of children and the habits of being one. He soon starts to focus on Rin and asks for a job position change so he can get off work earlier just to pick her up.<br />
<br />
The art is something that really compliments the mood of the anime in a way that gives it a childish feeling, but also giving off a warm feeling through the entire anime. The scenery was always nice to look at and made it really nice with the light color palette that the anime has. All the characters are given really nice detail with their facial structure and nothing is overly emphasized. <br />
<br />
The opening is a really cute song that supports the theme of family. The background music always fit each scene regardless if it was supposed to be a comedic scene or a serious scene. Along side the great characters you have wonderful voice actors to give them life and bring more to the table to offer. With Rin they used an actual kid as a voice actor which gave the anime a whole better sound to it rather than the usual adult voice actor.<br />
<br />
Overall this is an anime that is very realistic to which anyone can relate to. The concept of family and learning parent hood is something that is often overlooked and rushed with people today. The character development is very true to their personality and lets them shine from start to end to make a heartfelt anime that any true slice of life fan would enjoy. I recommend this to anyone who&#039;s looking for something relaxing and adorable to watch!

    Script - A guy takes care of a girl. Implications? She gets happier than before. Guy becomes more responsible. New connections are established on a superficial level and by the end what you have is a guide on how to raise children that actually doesn&#039;t work. Why? Because the child in question isn&#039;t a child, but an adult. A smaller version of it at least. She&#039;s so mature it is not even fun to see the protagonist parenting, we know it is not necessary. The only reason why the initial relationship between the two takes place is that she&#039;s traumatized due her father&#039;s death. That

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262134">
        leads to a very interesting moment when she&#039;s afraid of death and all, but it ends there. So in every episode you have a minor struggle and the bigger one is present in all episodes, that would be both trying to act like a natural family. However, that&#039;s already solved in previous episodes and I can&#039;t see signs of such struggle, making the plot tiring and boring. I don&#039;t care about parenting for the sake of parenting. Put something interesting in between such simplistic events otherwise no way it&#039;ll end up being poignant at all. The dialogues are rather normal and full of sameness and tropes like the one where the father says he&#039;s not going to do something, the child drops the head in disappointment and right after the father says he&#039;s going to do something else for the kid&#039;s amusement. How cute, I&#039;ve seen this just a couple of million times. The only credit I can give this show in terms of maturity is the fact it does not create stupid situations that would never happen in real life.<br />
<br />
Cinematography - Watercolor amuses me at some points, but suddenly everything goes normal again and there&#039;s nothing attractive about characters&#039; look. Camera angles are captivating at times, like in the first episode where they&#039;re utilized to construct a non-verbal relationship between the protagonist and the little girl. However, I&#039;ll not go as far as saying it impressed me overall, just decent enough and that&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The opening represents the growth process through plants just like in the actual story&quot; Obvious, Captain.<br />
<br />
Sound - I love tracks that keep playing all the time in most slice of life because there wasn&#039;t that much of effort being put in their production. The opening and ending are cool. Voices are not forced what is cool, but besides the girl&#039;s one that actually conveys some emotion in emotional moments, there&#039;s nothing special at all.<br />
<br />
1234 - zzzzzzzzz going to kindergarten zzzzzzzz going back from kindergarten zzzzzzzzz poop jokes from the boy who&#039;s there for some reason zzzzzzzzz *WAKING UP* did it end? Cute show. What happened again?<br />
<br />
Guy takes care of a girl very realistically during almost 4 hours. It&#039;s not bad, but not my thing either. I like parenting, but I don&#039;t like hearing from other people how they raise their children nor seeing it because it gets boring pretty fast. Usagi Drop could&#039;ve been great if only had explored themes or created bigger struggles for its characters. I heard from someone that the manga contains Incest, now that seems exciting.

    Beautiful...a word often used in the realms of the arts, except of course in anime. Anime is often comical, action packed, suspenseful, mysterious, heart-warming...but it is rare when one can truly describe an anime as being beautiful.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop is that anime. A show that, from the very beginning, knows exactly what it is, and is completely unapologetic about it. It&#039;s the video game without any combat, the movie without the almost naked woman, the novel where the main character is not the most important. Usagi drop breaks down all boundaries by attempting to break none. Tension, real tension, over tiny bumps in the road, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190065">
        substantive emotional feedback in the most mundane circumstances is what makes Usagi Drop stand tall above all other slice of life anime, and most others for that matter.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
Simplicity is the name of the game. Written out, the plot of Usagi drop would be an advanced kindergarten book, but that doesn&#039;t matter. No ridiculous plot twists, just an anime which attempts to shine a light on the inherit beauty of kindness, children, and life. But that is not to say the anime is too slow, rather it is paced perfectly throughout the episodes.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Nothing to say here. The art style was different, but it fit well with the theme of the anime.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
The sound track, like the story is simple. The voices and acting is well executed and directed.<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10<br />
I will only address the two main characters here. Daikichi is written excellently, he is nonchalant about most everything, but is easily freaked out by new things that Rin does or new experiences with Rin. Like a real person, he isn&#039;t some hell spawn constantly begging for the audience to feel for him, he&#039;s just a guy living an almost normal life.<br />
<br />
Rin is written like a child, and while it&#039;s strange to say, her, as a normal child, is incredibly refreshing. She isn&#039;t a target for emotional outpouring, she&#039;s just a child who behaves like a child. She&#039;s the weird combination of shy and outgoing that children tend to be.<br />
<br />
Like the story, the characters are written without anything particularly impressive, if you don&#039;t count behaving like humans without seeming impossibly cool or outrageously clueless impressive in an anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
Usagi Drop is just a good watch, and it is very easy to watch....I gave it a 10, so I obviously enjoyed everything...

    “Give me more episodes!”<br />
<br />
That was how if felt by the end of the series. There was just something magical about the series and it started to grow on me. I started off appreciating the show but not really enjoying it, but by the last episode I could not help but feel that another season of this series would be something nice to have.<br />
<br />
Going home from his grandfather’s funeral, thirty-year-old Daikichi is floored to discover that the old man had an illegitimate child with a younger lover. The rest of his family is equally shocked and embarrassed by this surprise development, and not one of them

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88213">
        wants anything to do with the silent little girl, Rin Kaga. In a fit of anger, Daikichi decides to take her in himself. As Daikichi nurtures Rin, he started to understand the struggle while at the same time the joy of parenting.<br />
<br />
The characters are realistic and are characters that you would be able to relate to. As such, you feel a bigger impact of each episode’s situations and you feel like you are part of that family as they go through their times of trouble when adjusting to the life of parenthood.<br />
<br />
Daikichi is a salary man who has spent his life as a single 30+ years old male without much thought about the future and thus struggles with life as a parent when it is suddenly thrust upon him. His character is so confused when it comes to most of the things regarding childcare and is essentially just taking things as they come which always makes it a fun to watch when he suddenly realises some of the simple things that are important to a kid.<br />
<br />
Rin takes on the role as the “mature/wiser” child who still retains her immaturity despite her maturity. She reminds me of kids who have gone through a lot and thus are wiser than the other kids around her age yet her behaviors and knowledge when it comes to things are still that of a kid. I think that is a good thing because that is essentially what her character is meant to be and her complicated past reflects in her behaviour and attitude. If only kids were like that these days. Oh how times have changed.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are also interesting to watch. Each of them have their own unique personality that are once again very nicely executed and easy to relate to.<br />
<br />
I love the pastel tones that are used for this show as it really gives that gentle and soft feeling that compliments the style of the show very well. <br />
The character designs take some getting used to since they are not similar to the generic style which our eyes would be used to but they are also not too drastically different.<br />
<br />
The one slight flaw of the show is the music, and while it is not bad, it is not memorable. It works as a part of the series, but the opening, ending and all the music in between do not stay with you long. That is probably just as well because what should stay with you after watching Usagi Drop is the show, and perhaps the music is an intentional after-thought.<br />
<br />
At eleven episodes, you really don&#039;t have an excuse to not watch this series. Usagi Drop will make you cry, it will make you laugh, and it will make you believe that there are beautiful things in this world and help you hope for a better tomorrow for all those who are shoved to the margins by society. I can&#039;t give this series a high enough recommendation, but it should suffice to say that you need to watch this show and hope that more studios are willing to break the mold in the future.<br />
<br />
This is a relaxing, gentle family drama series that will leave you with a heartwarming feeling at the end of each episode. To me, ‘relaxing’ would be the key word to describe this series.<br />
<br />
There is nothing over-the-top when it comes to this show and it is simply just a good and enjoyable series to watch during your off time.<br />
<br />
Rin, why you such an awesome child?!

    I fell in love with a 6-year old. Please don&#039;t call the cops.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A 30 years old man &quot;adopts&quot; a six year old girl out of pity and has to live with the consequences of suddenly becoming a &quot;father&quot;. That is technically all there is to it, but it is more than enough to work with. After all, the life of a child is full of events, a lot is changing and on top of that, we have 2 characters who have their lives turned upside down from one day to the next. All this is shown through Daikichis eyes, which is the perspective I can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review204167">
        relate to a lot more. It also makes Usagi Drop as sweet as a candy cane. This is slice of life done right, a little bit of drama here and there but ultimately a ride of fuzzy feelings and smiles. The only downside is that it&#039;s way to short with only 11 episodes.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Despite being focussed on a cute little girl, the anime does not fall into &quot;moe territory&quot;. It is cute and simplistic, but nowhere near the point where you could get the feeling it is forced. Being a story about children, Usagi Drop is bright and colorful, which fits this show very well. I also liked to see some normal looking adults for a change, you rarely have that in anime either.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening theme is kinda childish, fitting the anime well (fitting seems to be the major word of this review) and it is pretty catchy. Yet, it is not that great in my eyes, but as I mentioned in other reviews, this may just be a case of me having a very different taste in music. Pretty much the same goes for the ending. Something Usagi Drop really shines in though is the voices. Rin is voiced by an actual child, making her sound very convincing, but the others aren&#039;t bad either. Soundtrack is spare but never distracting.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The main selling point of this anime. Rin is the most adorable child you will ever see (spoiler: your child will not be this well-behaved) and it is pure joy seeing her grow from the shy little thing in episode one to the happy, normal kid in episode 11. Daikichi does a really good job being a father for her. His initial decision was pretty crazy from a realistic point of view, but he knows this as well and keeps improving to make Rins world a better place. The rest of the cast was okay, none of them stood out as special, but I guess that was not the point of Usagi Drop anyway.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I have a working day of about 8½ hours plus 1½-2 hours of driving. When I get home, I just wanna relax and have some fun. When I tuned into my daily dose of Rin, I felt at peace. It made me think that life is good. To watch a child grow up can really be all the joy you&#039;ll ever need and I think I can finally understand parents who give up everything for this one little thing.<br />
Okay, that was very cheesy, I apologise.<br />
Usagi Drop will give you a good feeling, wether you like children or not. As long as you don&#039;t mind the slice of life genre, you should definitely take a look at this.<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
9.0/10

Usagi drop was an anime that went under the radar for most on it&#039;s release, but has in the past few years grown to be a fan favorite slice of life series for casuals and otaku alike. I decided to check it out as I usually love cutesy slice of life, comedy, dramedy type stuff, but I went in with in caution because of a bad &quot;The Promised Neverland&quot; &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot; burn, but my worries quickly subsided. The story follows Daikichi Kawachi, a 30 year old bachelor working a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366088">
        good job, trudging through life blindly. However things take a turn when Daikichi&#039;s grandfather unexpectedly passes away, and the family finds out he had illegitimate daughter, a quiet, shy, but cute little girl named Rin. The family isn&#039;t treating her very well, even as far as verbal disrespect at the funeral and when the family gets into a spat about who would take her in, Daikichi is surprised at how rude everyone&#039;s being and decides to take in Rin for himself. The story that ensues is one of the cutest, heartwarming and eye opening experiences I&#039;ve had, teaching about the wonders and horrors of raising a child and of course the responsibilities. I won&#039;t go any further into the story as I think everyone thinking about watching this SHOULD watch it. It truly changed my outlook of raising a child and what it should be like and the unfortunate reality of what childhood is for some kids. <br />
<br />
Now you saw the rating the anime is an absolute masterpiece in my eyes. As a very stubborn person, if an anime is able to change my view on something that&#039;s automatically huge points, and with great visuals, music, characters and writing there&#039;s not much to dislike<br />

Now when you read the title I said to come read this paragraph if you were interested in checking out the manga, if you were hungry for more content. Here&#039;s a word of advice. DONT. Really. The manga &quot;ending&quot; is an absolute atrocity that throws out all of the heartwarming, cute, loveable goodness of the majority of the manga and the entire anime, and I think it&#039;s fair to say that it straight up ruins it. It of course doesn&#039;t affect my thoughts on the anime but theres a bitter taste in my mouth when I think about the canon timeline of the story. As much as the manga ending is canon, me and most of the community who know of it, don&#039;t acknowledge it. So yeah, don&#039;t read the manga and don&#039;t look at the Crunchyroll spoiler tagged comments, or the comments on the last episode at all and don&#039;t look at the manga ending unless you want a bitter aftertaste after the huge sweet sundae that is Usagi Drop.

    As a kid, I often searched for inspirations through celebrity pop stars, acclaimed sportsmen, and even fictional characters wearing underpants outside of their trousers. Whilst all that time, the tall figure holding my right hand was, and still is, the biggest hero of my life.<br />
<br />
Kanta Kamei gained lots of fans in 2011. Prior to that, he was involved in some other works, too, but this was his biggest and most successful role. As the director of Usagi Drop, he boosted confidence in 16 and 17 year olds into thinking doing “it” without protection might not be that bad.<br />
<br />
Daikichi attended his grandfather’s funeral and brought back

          <span style="display: none;" id="review72087">
        with him his 6 year-old aunt, Rin. Detested by his relatives for disowning her, Daikichi couldn’t forgo his sense of duty and adopted Rin on impulse. This might make Daikichi sounds irresponsible, he isn’t. Our protagonist quickly became aware of the needs to change his lifestyle and adapt. He accepts this wholeheartedly. You will see how the rapport between the duet flourishes into a father-daughter affinity.<br />
<br />
The relationship between Rin and Daikichi grew episode per episode. From what was an escape route becomes much more to Rin, her trust to Daikichi becomes that of a pure and innocent dependency. Throughout the 11 episodes, every little aspect, from planting Rin’s birth tree to doing Rin’s hair, add to strengthen their sense of comfort around each other. Without a mother in the house, Rin, somewhat, takes on the role and tries her best to fill the shoes. As mature as Rin might appear, she is and does act like a 6 year-old. Rin’s eyebrows curl when she’s irritated and her eyes portray a genuine surprise and excitement when she catches a glimpse of something new. You will see, but might not notice until it has happened for an extended amount of time, how Rin shifts from the sluggish girl who lost hope of being loved, to the spirited, big sister that is top of her class. Even Daikichi’s mother, who wanted to feed Rin to the wolves, begins to take a liking to Rin and labels herself as Rin’s grandma. This is, actually, a realistic character development.<br />
<br />
At times, Daikichi’s clumsiness will make you laugh at him and his abashment behaviour would make you pity him. But it’s the times when he shows his sense of duty, which would enact you to look up to him, carving a much stronger image of his character.<br />
<br />
The support cast carry weights as well. Daikichi’s two sisters provide insights from different angles into marriage, the conflicts that Usagi Drop didn’t make Daikichi and Rin go through, you can catch a sniff of from the supporting characters. After becoming a parent himself, Daikichi meets new people he would not have had otherwise. For example, Yujiari Nitani (voiced by the same seiyuu that voiced Lelouch from Code Geass…) gives this series an additional dimension; romance between Yukari and Daikichi is subtle but distinct. More significantly, Yukari can be seen as a mentor, for she is a more experienced and dependable single parent. <br />
<br />
Animation is well done, Daikichi moves like a giant when he walks whilst Rin skips next to him like a child would. Art is generally, crayon and childish looking, but by no means under-detailed. The manga has lots of frames for simple and short passages and its drawings are extremely clear, but the manga didn’t hint how an anime adaptation should look. This left Production I.G to make that decision themselves; the colour pallet they chose is very fitting of what the series projects and I am happy with their interpretation.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu for Rin did excellently for her infantile role. In fact, Rin is voiced by Matsuura Ayu, a 10 year-old girl, who later voiced for a supporting role in Eureka Seven AO.  Daikichi was voiced by Tsuchida Hiroshi, whose other roles were of mostly in shounen series, from evil scientist to Wolverine. It is nice to see Hiroshi attempting such a caring and mature role with a softer voice and doses of slapstick humour. Soundtracks are gentle, the opening and ending theme songs are very nursery.<br />
<br />
Heart-warming and comical moments help balance the serious topic of “how much one is willing to sacrifice for another’s child?” The comic-relief present here would not work in all series, it works here because Rin is just so cute. The V-shaped grin and button eyes are adorable; I too, would quit drinking and smoking for her sake and centre her as my priority. Never do I want to see those soulless eyes on her face again. The pace is slightly slow because nothing really dramatic happens in the series, but its charm accumulates through their daily activities and interaction with society.<br />
<br />
Usagi Drop does a good job in making you think raising a child can be a very rewarding tenure, an extra pair of hands around the house, cook the breakfast and water the garden. But what it pulls off even better is aspiring how being a parent, beyond its sacrifices and uncertainties, is the sudden realisation and transformation into a knight-in-shiny-armour to an innocent and naïve little sprout that would bloom into whatever form, shaped by the guardian’s influence. The growth of this intertwining and indivisible bond is to be forever cherished. Usagi Drop allowed me to discover all this alongside Kawachi Daikichi.<br />
<br />
