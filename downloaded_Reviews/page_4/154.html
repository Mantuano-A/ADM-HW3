In the second season of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Rimuru is mainly interested in creating equality for fantasy beings and humans. It would involve negotiating property, spheres of influence, and moral ideals with other races. If that conflict sounds interesting, you&#039;ll be disappointed. The story sweeps the perceived plot under the rug in favor of a one-sided war and meaningless dialogue. I would have preferred to see Rimuru gain equality for his people diplomatically as they hinted at. Instead, we got a formulaic fantasy war that became entirely pointless in the end. If you liked the first season

        of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime but wished it had been edgier, you might enjoy this.<br />
<br />
Despite the copious amount of dialogue, Slime is incapable of intelligently resolving conflicts without having characters fight. Aside from slightly better than average animation quality, Slime is similar to every other action isekai clogging up the seasonal anime roster. You could argue it&#039;s because the main character began a civilization, but it&#039;s surface level. Why is Rimuru&#039;s society so perfect? Why doesn&#039;t it have any problems? It&#039;s because he is perfect in the eyes of the author and the audience. He&#039;s written for you to project yourself onto a seemingly flawless hero. The weirdest part is, no one questions him. He&#039;s always right. The show had chances to prove it is mature by letting its dead characters stay dead. But death is never permanent unless it&#039;s the bad guys.<br />
<br />
The first half of the season spins its wheels like a carriage slowly approaching a cohesive story. Rimuru and co. fool around, and it is more or less what you&#039;d expect from an OVA of a typical anime. Plenty of fanservice to go around, the same lame jokes, no character development. The only &#039;story&#039; in this section is exposition dumps. Through conversations with aristocrats, Rimuru makes trade agreements for supplies. Their negotiations involve drinking alcohol, then immediately agreeing with each other. It’s boring. Rimuru still goes off on tangents explaining his next plans as an almighty leader to no one in particular. His dialogue continues to feel like meaningless word salad ripped directly from the light novel. He narrates to the audience as if the author has never heard of the term &quot;show-don&#039;t-tell.” The writers were somewhat aware of how dull the script was because Rimuru has a few unfunny quips to break up the monotony. The English dub makes more attempts at humor. That&#039;s even less funny than the Japanese jokes. His jokes read like they were written by middle-aged investors rather than someone with a sense of humor. The rest of the cast doesn&#039;t add to the humdrum script—or much of anything.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to care about any of these characters. Rinmuru&#039;s followers have individual drama, but it ultimately has no bearing on the story. Despite being nice to everyone, Rimuru doesn&#039;t seem to care when his people die—and I can&#039;t blame him. The side cast simply vomits exposition to progress the plot, and all of it is presented as slide shows that drag on for minutes on end: similar to The Promised Neverland S2. <br />
<br />
Compare these characters to the cast of Re:Zero; there are fewer of them, colorful personalities, they each get backstories, and the hero needs their help to succeed. Most of all, they have enough depth to intrigue us. In Slime Time, Rimuru can do everything on his own. There are unnecessary characters, and the relevant ones barely get characterization. Even the most present side characters are fanservice vehicles. Like Shion, AKA boob woman. In case you forgot her (I don&#039;t blame you), she is Rimuru&#039;s secretary who doesn&#039;t do anything except flop around and throw tantrums like a newborn child. Shion is your typical power fantasy waifu bait—she&#039;s inexplicably in love with the main character. Despite having powers, she constantly needs help, not just physically, but Rimuru needs to pacify her when she behaves like a child. It was almost laughable when we found out she was unceremoniously killed off-screen, along with scores of Rimuru&#039;s citizens. It was glaringly obvious they&#039;d be resurrected by the all-powerful Rimuru. At least that annoying scantily-clad loli was absent this season. <br />
<br />
The most memorable subplot told a sappy love story between two irrelevant characters. Their relationship progressed too fast even to care. Still, it was an attempt. The woman was a cliche damsel in distress; despite having powers (like Shion), she&#039;s incapable of doing anything independently. Hilariously, she even gets a powerup when her boyfriend hugs her. Unfortunately, the couple became little more than Rimuru&#039;s toys. In the eighth episode, Rimuru brutally murdered her. He declared, &quot;You need to die,&quot; with no explanation, then killed her in front of her lover. They embrace melancholically, he screams, she dies. Shortly after that, he reveals he had to rip out her heart and replace it with a new one to prevent the demon lord from controlling her. It&#039;s pretty convoluted, but what confused me the most is how unnecessary it was. Rimuru could&#039;ve easily done the replacement quickly, in private, or at least warned her boyfriend first. But no, this is Slime Time. Rimuru plays with their lives and our emotions for artificial drama. This scene is a microcosm of the show&#039;s biggest problem: The sad moments are inevitable and blatantly mapped out. If a villain dies, they stay dead, but the good guys rarely die permanently. I&#039;ve seen people defend this lack of stakes by saying, &quot;It&#039;s a comedy show. Of course, they come back to life.&quot; But why kill the characters, to begin with? There&#039;s nothing funny about it unless you find ridiculously predictable writing hilarious. <br />
<br />
Warning: Discussion of sexual assault below.<br />
At around the halfway point, the most contrived conflict in all of Slime Time began. One of Rimuru&#039;s civilians, a goblin kid, gets falsely accused of sexually assaulting a girl—and that&#039;s how the war ignites. Although the second season&#039;s political backdrop is one of uncertainty, it is not why the war began. Rimuru and his followers want things to change, namely integrating his mixed-race society with the homogeneous human civilization. The church represents the humans, who want society to regress—to achieve this, they endeavor to genocide all monsters. Rimuru&#039;s solution to the war is to win the war in five minutes (even those who surrender) and colonize their land. I cannot root for a protagonist who willingly kills people who surrender. That&#039;s a war crime in our world. Though I suppose that makes Rimuru no different than the average politician in the US. He&#039;s like the US president of the isekai genre. <br />
<br />
To tell you the truth, none of this intriguing political tension began the war—just comically evil villains who stirred drama for the sake of it. The girl who accused the goblin smirked menacingly when all the townspeople believed her immediately. It&#039;s lazy writing, at best. At worst, it shows the writer is out of touch with reality; women rarely falsely accuse men. Portraying these kinds of shallow conflicts makes women who speak up about sexual harassment only adds to the stigma that they deserve to be ashamed and discredited. If you&#039;re familiar with these kinds of controversies, you&#039;ll know the anime community harbors an inordinate amount of people who harass the victims. I should&#039;ve known Slime wasn&#039;t above using these tinker-toy Shield Hero plot devices. <br />
<br />
One of the girl&#039;s partners, a human with dark hair and a hoodie, is a 1-dimensional pervert—no different from Sword Art Online&#039;s antagonists. He objectifies Rinmuru&#039;s female companions by saying, &quot;I&#039;ll make her my slave. I&#039;ll torture her until she cries and begs for forgiveness.&quot; Then when he fights Shion, he makes her collapse. He smirks creepily, and the camera is below her boobs. It&#039;s trying to make the threat of sexual assault titillating. This hentai-tier screenwriting does nothing but pander to the lowest common denominator. <br />
<br />
The accusation leads to an all-out war fueled by racism towards the goblins. When Rinmuru sees the aftermath, he realizes there are consequences to his actions: Humans kill and injure his orc followers because of prejudice towards monsters. Long ago, he told them never to belittle other races, making them too trusting of bigots. What is the message? Racism is inevitable even if you attempt to be amicable. The problem with portraying racism in a fantasy setting is, creatures like goblins and orcs are fundamentally different beings (and predisposed to violence). There&#039;s no comparison to the real world. <br />
<br />
On the production side, there&#039;s a noticeable decline in quality: animation shortcuts, dull fight scenes, simplified character designs. There were times it looked like they used background art assets from roadblocks. Stiff CGI character models were placed right in front of the camera—it&#039;s like they didn&#039;t even care if we noticed it. The excessive still-images extended dialogue scenes, which likely caused some of the &#039;tell-don&#039;t-show&#039; problems. Montages, telling, not showing. Too many recaps every episode—there was a maximum of three minutes of recap in episode nine. Even if you were a fan of the first season, you would have trouble not noticing the blatant production problems in this one. At the very least, the opening and ending tracks are unmatched as usual.<br />
<br />
Part 1 of season 2 was a waste. Rimuru gained yet another powerup with little to no effort, turning himself into a God. In Part 2, he will embark on a quest to defeat this antagonist—a comically evil demon lord. He is wholly devoted to saving his friends from imminent danger, and to do that, he must become the new demon lord. It won’t raise the scale of Rimuru&#039;s powers to new heights, and the demon lord will likely be easily defeated. If it miraculously becomes good, I will eat my words.<br />
<br />
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime plays it safe by never letting anyone ever be in danger. There are no stakes, no real threats, and as a comedy it&#039;s worthless. This is a show that treats its viewers like children who are incapable of losing their favorites toys. It had one major opportunity to prove it could kill off side characters and become a fantasy series worth taking seriously, but it isn&#039;t. It wasted its last chance.

    When Tensura season 2 was announced last year, I instantly leapt for joy at the opportunity to see some of my favourite LN scenes adapted. I loved the job 8bit did with the first season and was confident that the series was in good hands. Fortunately, I had my faith rewarded with a great first cour.<br />
<br />
All the things that made tensura a hit when the first season aired are back and even better than before. The comedy, world-building, political drama and strategic planning that separates Tensura from other contemporary isekai are here in spades and make the second season very enjoyable. Like most things, Tensura’s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388160">
        first cour is not without faults, however.<br />
<br />
While it was great to be back in Tempest and see some of my favourite scenes animated, too often this season there was poor pacing and anime original time wasting recaps. They really begin to be noticeable around halfway through the cour. Several scenes really could have been condensed into a few minutes rather than taking up half of an episode. When you get to these points it’ll be pretty apparent what I’m talking about, and unfortunately they prevent me from giving the season the highest possible grade. Thankfully, 8bit did such a stellar job on the final 3 episodes that it’s almost enough to make you forget about those issues.<br />
<br />
Despite the pacing issues that the middle of the cour had, I was extremely pleased with the overall job that 8bit did in these first 12 episodes and I’m looking forward to what will be an even better 2nd cour, based on the volumes I assume will be adapted. If you were a fan of season 1 of Tensura, it goes without saying you’ll want to check this out. Tensura S2 Pt.1 gets 9 sages out of 10.

    [Overall score: 6.90]<br />
This season is a mix of half disappointment with half satisfaction. Half disappointment because the pacing has been absolutely terrible for more than half of the episodes, and half satisfaction because they redeemed everything with the last 2 episodes.<br />
<br />
5 out of 12 episodes are Rimuru doing Rimuru things, just like in the previous season. And then, the story suddenly takes a 180. Half of the episodes are just boring. It’s so boring that the first few episodes feel like fillers. We should’ve gotten the entire Rimuru becoming Demon Lord thing way before, yet it took this many episodes. If you’ve read the manga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388167">
        or the light novel, the pacing will be a huge issue to you. The biggest problem with this season is the terrible pacing. I don’t know what went wrong, but the pacing was so horrible, that even though I’ve read the manga once, I went back to re-read it.<br />
<br />
Shion was killed in the process of all the chaos, but of course, she wasn’t killed because there ‘happens’ to be some way to bring her back. I think this death was completely meaningless if they were gonna be alive again through some kind of magic.<br />
<br />
And of course, for some unknown reason, the anime decided to make Rimuru less badass than he was in the manga.<br />
“In other words, because you valued your own pitiful life more you’ve decided to damn my people.”<br />
This was the line that made me think that Rimuru finally had a change in his attitude, which of course, he didn’t. Because first, it was left out in the anime, second, moments after that he forgives Myulan. I don’t know why 8bit decided to do this, but it definitely wasn’t the right call.<br />
<br />
And don’t you think that it’s a bit ironic, how Rimuru is apparently ‘merciless’ towards the soldier who marched on Tempest, but then again, he simply forgives Myulan. The soldiers were in worse position than Myulan, if they didn’t follow orders, their family back home might’ve been killed. Some of them weren’t even involved in the killing of Shion and others, some of them were simply following orders. But of course, Rimuru is allowed to mercilessly kill all of them. Why? Because they aren’t cute anime girls. Why did Rimuru forgive Myulan so easily, without literally ANY FORM of punishment? Well, because she’s a cute anime girl. Isn’t it rule no. 1 to never hurt a cute anime girl no matter what kind of evil shit they do?<br />
<br />
And then the author tries to justify this shit cause by saying that he forgave Myulan because he needed Youm’s cooperation. It’s honestly such a laughable reason, I always get a big laugh when people try to defend Myulan or Rimuru for forgiving Myulan. Who cares about Youm? Who cares about Falmuth? Rimuru can be friends with Dwargon and all other countries while not giving a shit about what happens to Falmuth, but no, for some reason he needed Youm.<br />
Even Gabiru is more useful and important that Youm. This guy literally fell in love with a woman he barely knows, after staying with her for a few days. He loves her so much that he can even go against his master that he knew longer than he knew Myulan. He loves her so much that he can lay down his life for her or atone for sins she committed. It’s almost like he’s never been with another woman. And yes there’s some other beastman which I don’t give a shit about, that also likes her and will lay down his life for her. So she got 2 people in her harem within a few god damn days.<br />
<br />
Rimuru is the protagonist and the sole MC of this anime, yet side characters get more screen time than him. Good side characters like Benimaru and Souei barely get any screen time, side characters like Gabiru and Geld get too much screen time. The characters are a mess. The newly introduced ones are even worse, especially the antagonists. The antagonists are laughable. Every bad guy has a motivation or a goal, but these new antagonists don’t have any of them. The bad guys are terribly written, it came off as the author miserably trying to portray these bad guys as truly evil and annoying. Did the author succeed? Only partially. They are still horribly written. The king of Falmuth is a king, but he’s probably the most braindead character in the entire series. Almost makes you wonder, how did he become a king of an entire country?<br />
<br />
The animation is an upgrade since last season. It’s probably the most impressive thing about this season. But yeah, it’s okay, it’s nothing impeccable or remarkable enough to talk about.<br />
<br />
The soundtracks may be the second most redeeming thing, some time they decide to put some cool soundtrack over fights, which I can appreciate. Other than that, the opening is absolutely remarkable. It perfectly fits Tensura’s theme.<br />
<br />
I admit, this season has been lackluster and final 2 episodes could only do much to save the entire anime. Every other episode, other than the final 2 episodes, felt unimaginably boring. There were less fights last season yet it managed to stay more interesting than this season. Since I’ve read ahead into the source, does it get any better? Yes, probably..? I can only hope that the next season won’t have this pacing.<br />
<br />
Do we have something to look forward to? Yes, and that is Tensura Nikki. Unlike this season, Tensura Nikki will stay true to it’s core. If you want a wholesome, light-hearted side story, this is god damn it. Dare I say, it’s even better than the original. It feels less like a filler than the first 4 episodes of this season.<br />
<br />
As for this season, since it still has those key elements of Tensura and also a proper plot that works.. somehow.. a 6.90 will be the most accurate rating I can give to this.

    I won&#039;t be going into spoilers too much, though take that as a grain of salt since I usually have the habit of including them without really paying attention.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
I loved the first season, and it is indeed my favorite isekai which shouldn&#039;t really be surprising considering it&#039;s popularity. And so because of that, season 2 is still a 10/10 in story. It&#039;s a continuation and there hasn&#039;t been any new time skips and so, it&#039;s easy to pick up from the first season which I&#039;m really relieved about. <br />
Only small drawback was episode 1 when it had a small recap of around 2 mins,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review378481">
        which you can just skip. And that isn&#039;t enough to lower the score from a 10. <br />
<br />
Art: 9/10<br />
The characters and the feel is the same. I&#039;m really, really happy about that. It also looks really good. I don&#039;t really know what else to say other than it&#039;s still as amazing as it was in season 1. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The voice acting and sound effect are absolutely amazing, as it should be. Of course I don&#039;t really know what else to say in this category since as long as the story is good, I usually forget about stuff like sound and art, or at least don&#039;t pay as much attention.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
The characters are entertaining and funny the same way they were in season 1. Also I heard that the upcoming arc will be absolutely amazing and show the main characters from a different view point which I&#039;m really excited about.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
The humor is the same. Which I love. It has one of the funniest scenes in all of anime, especially in episode 3. But besides that, the characters, the world and everything else is just fun to watch and see how they evolve.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Basically, it has almost 0 drawbacks, and even if it has some, they are way too minor for me not to give this a 10/10. So far, it&#039;s one of the best and most entertaining isekai out there.

    &quot;Note, this review doesnt contain spoilers&quot;<br />
<br />
My god....never did I undertsand the hype of this anime. I talked to some people on Discord  why they liked it and they said, &quot;I like the slice of Life elements in the anime&quot; and &quot;the anime is funny&quot;. And still I dont understand, yeah I could see the slice of life elements but people this season die right and left and show blood because the anime is trying to be &quot;DARK&quot; but still the style is to childish for the theme of the anime itself. I dont like this anime maybe becuase it isnt for me or the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388165">
        show is just objectivley bad just like my English.<br />
<br />
Story-<br />
The story of this season expands the worldbuilding and  introduces new races and characters and also the racism against humans. As I already said in the beginning of my review that people are dying right and left and its up to our Main Protaganist to revive pointless chracters but hey, he has to do it because the story tells him to. Look, we dont get a sad but good anime like AOT where a lot of characters die and where you are like damn, they will never come back but in this anime its like &quot;Oh no, this chracter died, anyways&quot;. Fucking stupid. And its never established why humans are racist against monsters, is it becuase they are &quot;Different&quot;. How the hell do humans have this much power, they arent as strong as orcs, they cant live as long as elves and they dont have that good of a smell compared to beastman but still they have this much control. Couldnt the anime focus more on that instead of our Protaganist killing a bunch of meatballs. An other problem with this anime is that the Protaganist is just to OP. The tension is just removed and I just dont care about any fight in this show because I know how its going to turn out. Also I dont understand the side-quest because those are fucking lame but hey, we got to have them or else we will lost our fans. And what the hell is up that the Mc is teaching a bunch of kids how to use magic, never understood that part but you know what. I dont care really, becuase of how bad the story itself already is. Also, the pace is insulting for how fast it goes but thats not that big of a complaint.<br />
<br />
Characters-<br />
Characters in the show belong in 3 catagories and none of them are well written or funny in any kind of way so lets talk about that.<br />
<br />
1. Comedic characters<br />
2. Fanservice<br />
3. Pointless side characters<br />
<br />
1. Man oh man, why are there so many characters in this catagory. Like 40% of all chracters of this show belonged here. In the entire 12 episodes of season 2 I didnt laugh or smile a bit. I was like, &quot;can this already end please&quot;. For some reason the comendy is just bad in this show, characters make funny faces and annoying sounds and think I am supposed to laugh, the jokes get repetitve and just badly written just like the characters them self. And lets go back to an other point. Because so many characters in this show are &quot;Comedic&quot; is even trying to make the anime &quot;DARK&quot; an extremly stupid idea. For other anime like AOT its justified because there only like a few characters and they are also well written. So, please stop doing this to me.<br />
<br />
2. I dont even have to explain myself do I. Female chracters with boobs of the size of her head is already enough to make me hate an anime. Exept ofcourse if she is well written, well saidly no. None of the Fanservice characters are well written. Its just becuase the author didnt have a plan what to do in certian scenes so he was like &quot;hmmm, boobs are a good idea&quot; please, give me a break. I think like 15% belongs to this catagory. But still, fuck that trope man.<br />
<br />
3. Well, I dont understand but I cant even name a single character in the show besides the main character. This just shows that this show is just filled with pointless side characters that have something to say because of bullshit. I dont know why and how this happend but they could have at least some well written characters right? Sigh, I guess not. Verry sad indeed. And I dont know if I just dont pay a lot of attention or if the show is just bad.<br />
<br />
I forgot to talk about the protaganist but he is the best witten character in this show but that isnt really a plot-twist because he has the most screen time. I liked him more in his slime form then in his loli form because that is such obvious fan service. Not the worst Isekai Protaganist but not the best either.<br />
<br />
Sound-<br />
I tought it sounded fine, nothing special.<br />
<br />
Art-<br />
As I already said, I think that the art style is not that bad but if the show tries to have some darker elements, the art doesnt work well with that but the art isnt really that insulting like devilman crybaby,&quot;Cough,Cough&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-<br />
I dont know how I feel about the show but maybe its just me. Maybe this isnt my cup of tea and maybe it isnt even meant for me but I just didnt enjoy it alot. Yeah some of the fight were verry well animated stil, I knew how the fight was going to end and that kinda ruined it for me. Also as I said, the characters themself are just bad and dont add anything to the story or the anime. This wasnt a fun experience and thats sad becuase I expected more.<br />
<br />
Overall-<br />
You know how I feel about this anime. In my opinion it isnt a good anime and is as good as the average Isekai. It tried to be something diffent and they did it kinda, but still I see this anime as not good and I hope the next season isway better and fixes some of the flaws this season has.

    I absolutely love this anime. There nothing more to say. It has loveable characters and an overlooming plot despite the anime being very casual. I have long awaited the season 2 of this anime and it has not failed to deliver what it has before.<br />
<br />
Tensura (abbreviation) is one of those adventure anime that leaves you wanting to know what happens next and how our little slime friend has evolved. Season 1 ended with some loose ends but was very satisfying none the less and I wouldn&#039;t expect anything different from season 2 keeping its enjoyable aspects all throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
I was able to enjoy this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review377328">
        anime VERY MUCH because of the wacky situations our main character gets into and the not so much wacky situations about the typical demon lord being the enemy. If you like casual anime with aspects of comedy, yet want some action, this anime is perfect for you!<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is great and I personally love it. I would definitely recommend this to basically anyone.<br />
<br />
I would like to give it an 8.5/10, but since that is not allowed, an 8/10 will have to suffice.

    That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime’s title is about as straightforward as it can get. It’s about a character that got reincarnated as a slime and now lives in this other world as one. We’ve all come to know Rimuru now as a charismatic leader with real life knowledge and skills imperative to his people. He has earned the praise and trust of his friends and comrades. From season 2, we witness Rimuru’s development as a character as the slime that got reincarnated.<br />
<br />
While this season doesn’t start off with epic battles, it does show that Rimuru can solve problems with diplomatic skills. After

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388163">
        all, action and violence doesn’t always decide victories. Through negotiation, we hear Rimuru’s wise words and show that when needed, he can be very clever with his way of words. The Kingdom of Eurazania in particular has a leader who isn’t exactly very softhearted. Applying his skills and experience, there’s no doubt that Rimuru carries his role as an exceptional leader. Thanks to their negotiation, not only are battles avoided but they’re able to gain access to new technologies and trust with another kingdom. It’s the type of sweet victory with no casualties or regret.<br />
<br />
Because of Rimuru’s abilities and great potential, it would seem that not every country see him as a dependable ally. The Kingdom of Falmuth in particular realizes that Rimuru may be a great threat and doesn’t take long for them to take action. And honestly, trying to invade a nation immediately sparks a war. Should we be surprised? In reality, no. However, it’s honestly depressing that peace can’t be maintained in their world and no one is truly safe from certain kingdoms from fulfilling their own interests. Tempest’s people learn first-hand what it means when it means to be invaded with innocent lives at stake. It’s a brutal reality to accept but when war happens, that means causalities. To make matters worse, Rimuru has to be concerned about his own life when he encounters Hinata Sakaguchi, a skilled warrior with the intention to assassinate him. In one of the series’ pivotal battles, we see Rimuru’s combat skills again this season. And to no one’s surprise, he hasn’t lost a touch.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the citizens of Tempest, without Rimuru to lead them at the time of the attack, the city took a heavy hit under the siege. It’s hard to say this but if you’re a fan of Shion in this franchise, then I’ve got some depressing news to bear. She’s not just the only causality of the invasion either. The invasion itself also breeds fear, hatred, and an emotional anger that I’ve never seen in the likes of Rimuru before. Even as a slime, his behavior mirrors those of a human and it’s quite realistic on many levels. Luckily, Rimuru’s strategic mind always look for solutions to problems and we find out that what’s dead may not need to stay dead. In addition, this season reveals more about Rimuru’s past life and what he was like as an actual person. The deep dive into Rimuru’s character remains important as he works tirelessly to lead his people. The planning of his strategy to protect Tempest and also defeat the invaders is an example of his growth as a character.<br />
<br />
How much should you ultimately respect Rimuru comes down to your impression of his actions. At this point, I think it’s safe to say that Rimuru is much more than skilled fighter or leader. His influence has become so great that other kingdoms knows his potential. There’s even assassinations put on his head as an example of Rimuru’s testament in power. To further his potential, Rimuru even goes to lengths to bring back the dead, something that goes against the natural law of order in the real world. Whether you agree with Rimuru’s action can be debatable. However, we must acknowledge his feats and achievements in this season.<br />
<br />
Action does indeed speak louder than words. Rimuru’s leader for the Tempest people knows no bounds when it comes to his accomplishments. Watching this season shows that Rimuru is more about just winning battles. He’s there to win the trust of the people and during difficult times, he goes to unimaginative lengths to unite them. That’s what I call the suitable leader and honestly, I don’t think there’s anyone in the show that’s more suitable to represent Tempest. As dramatic as this season sounds though, there are still moments of humor from Rimuru’s perspective. He hasn’t lost his softhearted personality either and is still open to making jokes. That being said, season 2 is a blessing to us, especially if you’ve waited for over a year. There’s not much waiting left for part 2 either because we’re getting more Tensei Slime goodness this Summer.

    :: This review was written after watching all 12 episodes and may contain some spoilers ::<br />
<br />
TenSura season 2, marks the return of our favourite slime: Rimuru Tempest, and his journey&#039;s crest and troughs of running a nation. A season filled with political satire, laughter, and violent beatdowns, it has a bit of everything. So while trying to keep this review as succinct as possible, let us dive into hopefully, not a bad review of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2.<br />
<br />
:: Story ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
The story of this season can be compared to that of the thrill while riding

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388161">
        a roller coaster—from exploring the banal aspects of lore building, to portraying many of the series&#039; most memorable moments yet—while the initial part of the cour worked on fixing the plot holes and building up tension, the endgame went all in for the action. Rimuru&#039;s wrath precipitating his growth to becoming a Demon Lord, will remain one of my favourite scenes ever. Also nobody can overlook Hakurou&#039;s redemption, and Shougo&#039;s macabre yet satisfying beatdown at the hands of Gerudo. The story is in no way left wanting, and I feel it lays a robust foundation for the later seasons to reach sterling heights!<br />
<br />
:: Art &amp; Sound ~ 10 out of 10 ::<br />
Although the art of TenSura can look a bit shabby, it perfectly complements the music, that never fails to disappoint. And by ringing together celebrated musicians like TRUE and STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION this time around, added that extra cherry on top. By conflating the silly yet beguiling art with some of the most ethereal music out there, I feel like this season of TenSura absolutely nails this department.<br />
<br />
:: Characters ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
The characters for the most part, at least the ones who play a significant part on the story, remain the same. The first season had a very amiable cast, hereby, this season also rubs off a similar vibe. The only &quot;new&quot; new addition to the cast is Mjurran (not including Diablo cause of his appearances in the OVAs), and I find her the weak link of the show. Her character and the way she is portrayed is just so soporific. Other than that, the characters of this show invigorate the overall enjoyability of the show.<br />
<br />
:: Enjoyment &amp; Overall ~ 9 out of 10 ::<br />
I have had a blast watching this season, it embellished my Tuesdays with joy and laughter. It was one of, if not my favourite anime of the season. Watching each episode was a riveting experience, and couldn&#039;t wait for next week to dive into the next episode. The conglomeration of beguiling story telling, good art, top-notch music, winsome characters bounds me to give this a 9. Can&#039;t wait till the part 2 drops this July!<br />
<br />
:: PS. Cheers to the peeps who got the &quot;not a bad review&quot; reference in the beginning. &lt;3 ::

    One of the best anime i ever watch.<br />
<br />
this is my first time to make a review. I love this anime until I finish the whole series of stories in the manga. Also i always watch every episode on this anime. Very outstanding<br />
<br />
If you find this anime from season 2, you better start from season one. And the advantages of this anime, even though I have read the manga, I am still enthusiastic about watching the anime.<br />
<br />
I gave it a 10/10 for the anime, and a 9/10 for the manga. Hopefully this year a new edition of the manga will come out<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Art: 10<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Enjoyement: 10<br />

    The first season is too good to be true. I prepared for this anime by watching the whole season 1 before it airs. But, now, my hope is all shattered. This season has the laziest writing. They are constantly talking. Too much attention on the unnecessary problems and stupidly long planning. It wants us to believe something is happening but in reality, nothing interesting is happening. The animation is still good but the story falls flat so hard. So, 5 is a fit.<br />
<br />
This is so frustrating. I am really looking forward to a good season but it seems it won&#039;t happen.

    :: Tensei shitara slime datta ken season two is something we have all been asking for. I really loved the first season. I waited three whole years for this season to air. Hopefully this season was worth waiting three years. You can say this season has all the elements the first season had plus some more new elements that would make you jump off your seats. <br />
<br />
::Minor Spoilers<br />
Story 9/10: This season is a bit more intense than the previous season which was a bit more happy-go-lucky. In the previous season Rimuru Builds a Nation now he tries to protect it from other Nations.Each episode left

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388155">
        me so hyped. This season has a pinch of Romance too (I am not a big fan of it though). You can understand when you watch it.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10: There art is so beautiful. I really love the art of the setting of the anime. The way trees are colored are so beautiful too. I love how all the new characters are drawn especially Mjurran (So cute).  :D<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10: The opening and Ending of this season are pretty good.The voice acting is on spot and all the sound effects merge with the background.<br />
<br />
Character 8/10: All the new characters this season are well drawn and I really like all of them.Like I said I didn&#039;t really like the romance between Mjurran and Youm cuz you dont understand why they hell they even love each other.In one episode they are complete strangers and in the next episode starting Youm sleeps in Mjurran&#039;s lap (Really pissed me off). But otherwise everything is on point.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10: As a very big fan of &#039;Good&#039; isekai I really enjoyed this season. I really liked all the action scenes. If you are gonna watch this season you are not gonna regret it.<br />
<br />
Bye-Bye!!

    well after watching 6 episodes I got to know that the first four episodes are for story development. ***For the haters: who thinks that the four episodes are filler episodes, I would like to gladly say that THIS IS NOT A RE:ZERO where for every episode there&#039;s a twist. This is TenSura and it will be TenSura.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk slowly now:<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Rimuru&#039;s Busy Life&quot; : <br />
<br />
This one explains us about the recap (just for some 5-8 min) of Season 1 and the developing relationship with Animal Kingdom. Well this is a good episode as there is some recap and talking about the post-Charybdis war. Well the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380289">
        behaviour of that white tiger girl pissed me too. So I would like to give 3.5/5<br />
<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Trade with the Animal Kingdom&quot; :<br />
<br />
Yep the fight between Shion and the white tiger. I thought that there will be a good beating for her. But Albis stops it and says that it&#039;s just testing them. Well if that become a big fight and shine killed that tiger there might be a war with Animal kingdom. Hopefully the peace restored and now everyone&#039;s is enjoying the days in Capital city Rimiru. But here comes the twist why did the king Gazel invited rimiru. Hope I will see it the next week. A new character called Mjurran is introduced and she works for Clayman. Let&#039;s see what happens. I would like to give 3.5/5<br />
<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Paradise, Once More&quot; :<br />
<br />
Here comes the most funniest episode of Season 2 part 1. Well we know those ELF ladies actually from s1. Now Rimiru and the brothers along with Gobta will enjoy there. But the most wicked thing is when shona finds about this.... I hope if I were reincarnated into a slime better I don&#039;t piss her off. The Clayman&#039;s subordinate Mjurran power is shown. She&#039;s powerful and she defeat Youm with a single spell. She joined him. Hmm a betrayal concept? My rating: 3.75/5<br />
<br />
<br />
4. &quot;The Scheming Kingdom of Falmuth&quot; :<br />
<br />
Ya in this one the war arc starts right now. Mjurran came to tempest and visited Shion and Shuna along with Youm. Gobta and You fight with OLD GEEZER is pretty funny. Some romantic interests are developed. Introduction of  FALMUTH kingdom is done and their plan. Three otherworlders?? Not same as rimiru, I mean they are summoned right? Let&#039;s see how the trio gonna destroy the kingdom. (Basically I was pissed off, for insulting rimiru). Millim&#039;s looking mad, what might have happened? I like to give 4/5<br />
<br />
<br />
5. &quot;Prelude to the Disaster&quot;<br />
<br />
Well in this episode  I missed Rimiru but I think this episode is the core of the arc. It start&#039;s with a pure breeze of Lovey-dovey moments between Youm and Mjurran. Well Clayman finds about it and grants her a wish to save him if she successfully deployed a anti magic field. Well the beastman Grucius find she&#039;s the subordinate of Clayman. Youm hears this and confess his love. Pretty cute right? But still she deployed the anti magic barrier. On the other side Millim declares war and The three otherworlders are provoking Shuna and Shion. A Holy barrier is deployed and weakens the monster. A major development in the story. My rating 4.5/5<br />
<br />
6. &quot;The Beauty Makes Her Move&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm I can&#039;t say what&#039;s going on but I feel so sad. Like I&#039;m falling down in a black hole. This episode makes me to feel like that. Hinata vs Rimiru is seen, damn Hinata she&#039;s not listening to him and attacks him. Meanwhile in Tempest, everyone is attacked. Gobta and Hakurou gets a slash and shion gets an attack too. The tempest is plunged into chaos. At the end rimiru is stabbed by Hinata...... Damn I can&#039;t write this!!! My rating : 5/5<br />
<br />
7. &quot;Despair&quot;<br />
<br />
So here comes the end of battle between Hinata and Rimiru. Well it comes to rimiru&#039;s win by escaping cleverly. But the sound effects are fu**ing awesome. Tempest is totally covered in blood and the villagers trying to hide it from rimiru but he got to know when Mjurran shows him. That was the first time I saw rimiru&#039;s eyes were scary. But great sage sort it out. At the end rimiru got to know that Clayman&#039;s is pulling strings. My rating: 4/5<br />
<br />
(Hey you damn director, increase the length of the episodes. those 23 minutes were like 5 min to us!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
8. &quot;Hope&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I think if any slime fan didn&#039;t cry in the episode starting... they are not.... <br />
This is a pretty good episode. Well it&#039;s starts with Mjurran, and how did she attack and everything. But the episode turns pretty intense at Shion&#039;s death. Well I cried today at this scene even though I know what&#039;s going to happen. But Eren.. (FROM S1) she reaches the tempest and tell her about a fairy tail about reviving from death and OUR BADASS RIMIRU WANTS TO BECOME A DEMON LORD NOW!!! pretty interesting right? also he saves Mjurran and request YOUM TO BECOME A KING OF FALMUTH!!! Let&#039;s see what happens next..  Rating: 4.5/5<br />
<br />
9. &quot;With everything&quot;<br />
<br />
I can say that this episode will be a low scorer than the remaining episodes for this season. In this episode there&#039;s a recap what happened till now for the first half. YOU&#039;LL FIND IT BORING FOR SURE!! <br />
But don&#039;t worry. The next part will be a slight okay except the last 5 min. They will be planning to deal with the Farmus kingdom and devise a strategy. AND THAT 5MIN END IS RoCkINg. It&#039;s like Calm before the storm. Overall the episode is not upto hype. But it&#039;s okay to watch. Rating 2.5/5<br />
<br />
10. &quot;Megiddo&quot;<br />
<br />
If you watch this episode then I don&#039;t need to tell you how&#039;s it. A REVENGE-TIC Episode for the first time in my life. The animation was crazy and the sound... Guys we need to give him an award for it. Hakuro vs the other worlder , I got what I want. I don&#039;t want to extend the review.Because it will be a spoiler... But today&#039;s episode is LIT!!! Rating: 5/5<br />
<br />
<br />
11. &quot; Birth of Demon lord&quot;<br />
<br />
See you on March 16th

    It’s hard not to feel at least somewhat conflicted with this first part of the Slime’s 2nd season. Part of it comes down to how inconsistent and middling the show is, but there’s another reason for this. That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a series built around its novelty value. <br />
<br />
The gimmick of a slime building and ruling a nation from scratch was a refreshing one, as it allowed for straight-forward fun and more vibrant animation than what one would expect from most isekai. Of course, when the charm of its premise wore off, the latter half of the first season petered

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388216">
        out with less interesting arcs. However, the presentation still had some fun tricks up its sleeve to keep the experience less dry than some of its contemporaries.<br />
<br />
With Slime 2, there’s novelty in watching a seemingly benevolent leader witness everything crumbling down before he administers karmic, cataclysmic retribution. Despite the show’s reputation as a charming, vibrant isekai that’s more palatable than most of its brethren, it’s never been a stranger to darker storylines and plot points. Rimuru himself was never averse to combatting enemy armies in order to protect his kingdom and forcefully expand relations. It’s just that this time, things are personal and as such, this first cour is the story of how Rimuru becomes a triumphant and mildly tragic war criminal who has to rethink his approach to inter-kingdom relations. It makes for a fun experience on the surface once those moments hit, but that’s more so because RImuru and the show extent actually have the balls to get this bloodthirsty, rather than due to good writing.<br />
<br />
In spite of the main gimmick being warped into something far darker and more dramatic than usual, the show never quite lives up to the heights of S1’s first arc. Where that arc was well-paced and laid down its more dramatic moments with tact and not a lot of redundant exposition, Slime 2 does the opposite. This is most apparent with Youm’s subplot with newcomer Myulan, as she constantly monologues about how in spite of denying her own feelings for him, Youm is such a fool for trusting and loving her considering she’s being sent by Clayman to assist in Tempest’s destruction. The entire middle portion, once the show transitions into its big arc, is a slog where the fights become more about the inner monologues and explaining each other’s powers and positions than the actual fights, which aren’t that well-animated outside of a few solid cuts, anyway. The pacing also feels really weird, as in we get moments like the aforementioned that linger on extraneous nonsense or how episode 9’s conversations and pity party could have been truncated if not for how it inserts a recap at the very start with S1 footage. At the same time, some scenes don’t get enough time to breathe in the middle episodes, like with Youm’s romantic subplot developing way too fast.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most distasteful moments in the mid-section involve the otherworlders, a pair of humans from our world who act as repulsive brats that try to purposefully and falsely accuse some of the Tempest goblins of sexual harassment in the case of Kiara, and comment on how they want to makie Shion and Shuna into his sex slaves in the case of Shougo. Disregarding how the latter feels even more discomforting given the existence of a certain Healer show this season,  this is just a really gaudy attempt at getting us to further hate characters the show already convinced us were pieces of shit. Clayman, the main antagonist of both cours of S2, has far more restraint with how he’s presented, allowing him to maintain a level of presence and villainy without the show having to go overboard on him being a manipulative scumbag. Even the king of Farmus, the antagonistic force of this cour, doesn’t feel this gratuitous, considering how the otherworlders reek of more rancid LN titles like Akashic Records. It’s fun watching them get their comeuppance thanks to the final ⅓ of this cour having some solid cuts as the baddies get squashed. However, it’s not the easiest to get invested in.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is also the show’s cast. Slime has never had a particularly memorable cast, as most were just Rimuru’s lackeys with a few personality differences that get exploited for some decent gags and explosive moments. However, they certainly don’t get a chance to be more interesting this season. Even in the set-up phase of the first 4 episodes, we still have particularly embarrassing moments like Shion wailing cuz Rimuru wouldn’t take her with him. A lot of this was easier to deal with in the less dramatic arcs of S1, but since this season becomes more focused on serious storytelling, it’s hard not to feel at least a little empty when the show doesn’t tighten up its characterization or even feel particularly brutal when shit hits the fan. <br />
<br />
Rimuru himself has some cool shots to express his sorrow and silent wrath in the final few episodes, and those imposing moments land quite nicely. However, the novelty of his charm has worn off now and he’s kind of a boring protagonist without too much to make him particularly compelling or memorable when the show switches from cutesy hijinks to serious warfare. The finale does bring back the charm of him being very reactive and willing to use his previous world’s knowledge in quirky ways like with the naming of Diablo. However, moments like this and him being a bitter, sore loser in ep 6 are a bit too rare. <br />
<br />
When he crosses that line to get revenge on Farmus by mowing down hoards of soldiers that weren’t even part of the initial invasion that burnt his kingdom, even though there are more benevolent reasons attached to this, it’s not as easy to get on-board with as the show wants it to be. In fact, no one objects to or feels reservations about this, not even Youm, who hails from Farmus. Actually exploring the morally gray nature of his actions this season considering he’s forced to rethink his stance on humans, would go a long way to add weight, drama, and humanity to this conflict. However, tension is only allowed in the shortest of bursts, and it favors an explosive ass kicking gauntlet with a tinge of vague tragedy, as opposed to doing anything that would prevent it from both having its cake and eating it too. The least it could do is be more ruthless in some of the violence on display in the final few episodes, but alas, that’s not the case. Slime 2 is a bit too toothless for what it shows outside of some cool finishers.<br />
<br />
The presentation in S2 is passable on its own merits, but pales in comparison to the vibrance of S1, even if both entries are rather inconsistent in terms of artwork and sometimes animation quality. While there are some sick moments like Hakuro’s final move against Kyouka or the explosive final move Hinata lands on Rimuru before the latter escapes, there are also several jank moments throughout even the better episodes. Atsushi Nakayama went from assistant director of S1 to the primary director here, and the vibrant animation and fun, playful multimedia menu explanations for Rimuru’s powers have decreased. Both that and Rimuru’s playful visual interactions with “the great sage” are dramatically doned down outside of the finale and maybe one other moment this season. Additionally, some of the fights this season, particularly in the middle, look downright terrible compared to most of S1. Moreover, there is a surprising amount of lackluster CGI, particularly for the invading army of Farmus. There’s also just generally less visual flair here, which is best evidenced in the character of Diablo. In S1 ep 24 and the OVA episodes, his introductions had a sinister, grand presentation with some of the most striking visuals in each of these entries. He commanded a serious, sinister presence, even when the visuals of S1 sometimes failed to match that in his big fight scene. His summon in S2 had some shades on that, but he feels far more subdued compared to before since the visuals barely capture how imposing he is. There are some fun moments with how flamboyant and eccentric he can be, but the point still stands.<br />
<br />
Even the audiovisuals of S2 are at least a little weaker, but that’s mainly thanks to “Storyteller” being one of the weaker TRUE anisongs, and “STORYSEEKER” from STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION being a far cry from S1’s EDs. It’s a shame that neither Azusa Tadokoro nor Takuma Terushima had songs this season, but eh, maybe in the next cour we’ll get something from them. The actual OST done by Elements Garden  is still fine, with some suitably somber or epic-sounding tracks that feel more notable in the last 5 episodes. The series doesn’t even reuse as many tracks from S1 as expected, which is nice, and the sound effects are as crunchy and bass-boosted as ever. <br />
<br />
To move onto another positive note of Slime 2, the first 3 episodes do still retain the magic of S1’s early episodes, barring the aforementioned scene of Shion crying. Revisiting the Drawf kingdom and the Elf tavern was pretty entertaining. Jokes such as dwarf king Dwargo lecturing Rimuru for his apparently weak speech towards the former’s kingdom, and having that echo in the back of Rimuru’s mind when his apology towards Shion and Shuna for sneaking out with the boys to the Elf tavern result in him eating Shion’s food for a weak are pretty fun. Watching Rimuru navigate politics with the Eurazania kingdom with liquor and some 1 v 1 battles with Shion and Youm against some of Eurazania’s best was cool. There are other fun gags and moments here, and even a few glorious bits later on like with what Rimuru decides to do with Youm, Myulan, and other newcomer Grucius in episode 8. However, the show can’t exactly go back to all of this without cheapening some of the drama presented here, even if the end game of the season inherently does that to some extent despite how brutal a lot of moments in the penultimate episode were. Well, the show does go back, and that’s part of why the show being somewhat toothless and completely unnuanced in the handling of its more serious and grim moments stings so much. <br />
<br />
This is actually where the structure of the series comes in. On some level, this is the fault of the original material, but it’s taken to a whole new level with this adaptation. With S1, the creative team and producers had a hard time settling on how long they wanted the adaptation to be, which led to a very jittery 2nd half that had to skip the first half of arc 4 just so it could get to the part with the kids to end the season on something resembling a climax. This left the Eurazania and Farmus set-up for this season. Given that S1 ended right before the arc everyone had been waiting for, a lot of people were frustrated when S2 had to come back to what was left behind just to provide context for what the rest of the season was poised to adapt. <br />
<br />
A problem that was averted by the finale was the seeming lack of presence Millim had this time around. In episode 8, Eren details a fairy tale to Rimuru after explaining the truth about her and the party she traveled with back in the first arc. This fairy tale meant to give Rimuru some hope, just so happened to be Millim’s tragic backstory presented in a form reminiscent of a hybrid of motion comics and stained-glass windows, and adds a lot to the show’s worldbuilding. In spite of what the entire scene means for the narrative, it was one of the best moments in the show for the sheer level of context it provides that add to some of the more likable side characters (who kinda just show up here) and to elements that could be exploited in the future. Up until this point, Millim herself only appeared once this season...in a 2 second scene with no dialogue because the anime wanted to show that Clayman is sending her to wage war on Eurazania that way Rimuru has his hands full with two war conflicts to resolve. However, the finale brought her back to fight Eurazania’s lord, Carrion, in a big way with one of the coolest battles in the series. Her finisher was particularly glorious to witness, more than rectifying what was initially a strange issue with this cour that could have been indicative of the structuring of the adaptation.<br />
<br />
The finale itself is probably the best episode of the season, with how it sets up the future conflict in an exciting fashion while showcasing some of the vibrance and charm the series strove to have with RImuru’s and Benimaru’s “password” fiasco as well as the last two scenes of the show. In spite of the myriad of issues the arc itself had, it at least ended on a high note.<br />
<br />
The 2nd Season of That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a rather conflicting experience. Before and at the end of the big arc the season adapts, there’s still some of that charm that made early S1 so refreshing. However, the arc itself, and even some of the build-up to it, are rather laborious at times and laden with obnoxious issues reminiscent of the worst LN anime. It’s not even as boring as some of latter-day S1, let alone as unenjoyable as the frustrations mentioned above could make it seem. There’s still some enjoyment to be had with Slime 2, just like before. While S1 definitely petered out after a while, it was perhaps the most charming isekai anime out there prior to Bookworm. However, now we have better options, and the show really does begin to stumble under the weight of a more serious direction and the structuring problems it dealt with as an adaptation since S1. There is some mild satisfaction and surprise in watching a show like this get as dark as it does by the end, but it doesn’t entirely stick thanks to certain plot points, the suboptimal writing of the show’s villains and drama, and how the show never goes hard on its morally gray ideas and sheer brutality. <br />
<br />
There are several hilarious moments, especially early on, and some of the fights are relatively entertaining. Unfortunately, the show’s foundation really needed to be better if it wanted to execute a more expansive and dramatic arc with the finesse it once had in simpler times. Slime 2 part 1 isn’t a complete waste, but it’s about on par with S1’s weaker arcs and it doesn’t even look as good as before. There are several fun and amusing moments, but once the straightforward fun and novelty wear off and it’s time to be more critical, it’s hard not to acknowledge that we’re left with a bit of a mess. Hopefully the second cour picks up and the Shizue arc can finally have some real competition for &quot;the best arc of Slime&quot;.

Ever think that you&#039;re getting tired of the average isekai trash with a plot where there isn&#039;t an end premise? With average characters getting OP powers? No character development? An Average fantasy world with average magic? With little to none enjoyment at all?<br />
<br />
Well you&#039;ve come to the right show, Slime gives you: <br />
<br />
Average isekai plot with an end premise. A character getting OP powers however he isn&#039;t the only one OP (more of that later on in the story). Amazing world building with character development. Easy to understand fantasy world with intresting magic system. Lastly, it is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review386246">
        filled with pure fun.<br />
<br />
Simply put, it isn&#039;t the perfect show it had it&#039;s up and downs with 8bit presenting it, however that doesn&#039;t make it another &quot;average isekai trash.&quot; metaphorically speaking it&#039;s an &quot;Above average isekai.&quot; In fact, i believe it doesn&#039;t stand out at all when compared to something like Overlord or Re:Zero. However that doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t any enjoyment at all.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not as perverted as Mushoku tensei, It isn&#039;t a snoozefest like Cheat magician, There isn&#039;t a gimmick/ twists like Re:zero. It&#039;s not as stupidly overpowered like Demon king academy. It doesn&#039;t try to disguise itself making us think that it isn&#039;t an average isekai, no. It&#039;s the &quot;ideal&quot; isekai. It has every trope in every average isekai we&#039;ve seen but does those tropes in a way that doesn&#039;t make it a snoozefest.<br />
<br />
Personally i would rate 10/10, but without biased opinions it&#039;s a hard 8.3-8.5. It&#039;s one of the shows that from the outside looks like your average Ugly Bastard. But in reality it&#039;s a diabetic enthusing vanilla

    loved the first season but not sure what changed in the 2nd season that has made it completely unwatchable to me. the plot lines, characterization, and dialog seem like they have all dropped off a cliff.<br />
<br />
 remiru seems bland now and their focus on the drama of the town has sapped all the comedy and laughs i got from him in the first season. wasn&#039;t expecting it to be as good as the first season but this just feels rushed and uninspired, like your typical hollywood cash grab.<br />
<br />
 i keep watching more in hopes that it turns around but i think this is probably just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382642">
        a lost season and hopefully someone in charge will realize how bad it is and fix it for season 3. if it even gets a season 3, could definitely see it being canceled after this season

    I loved the first season and was looking forward to season 2.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed how the first season built upon itself, episode by episode. It was relaxing, entertaining and also made me smile in some parts.<br />
<br />
However, so far, in my opinion, the second season really poor. At first, nothing is happening.  It would be alright if there was either a slow acceleration of the plot or just a plot twist, but what happened during later episodes feels non-consistent. Random people come killing the whole town. An op enemy shows up, attacks, and disappears just like she appeared. I mean, ok. It is up to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review381524">
        creators. However, it does not give me the same vibe as the first season. Not by a longshot.<br />
<br />
In the end, I would like to remind you that it is just my opinion and you are free to like it if you do not mind what I did. It is just that I am a little bit sad since I was really looking forward to the second season.

    Boooooring and slow paced so far spending  whole episodes just talking nonsence .<br />
when i  watched the first season i thought this one would be better with more action but they seem to stretch the story and make unnecessary dialogues and scenes ,wich makes it so boring<br />
I fell like i&#039;m watching a channel 7 drama series. <br />
first season i gave it an 8 overall mainly for the story and character développement,in my humble opinion when you make a first season like that you must make a better 2nd season not destroying it .<br />
watching these 8 episodes was a pain in my butt <br />
i think

        we dont mind good speeches and peaceful times but when you give characters great powers like those and them make them drink and farm all the time that destroys the whole purpose .

    As much as i love the series, this season tries really hard to change it.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m rating it purely based on my feelings and the assumption that anyone watching it, or planning to, is already familiar with the show and Isekai Genre in general. <br />
<br />
While the plot, characters and setting is still great, whole season feels extremely dragged-out, slow paced to the point of not being enjoyable anymore.<br />
There should be a proper balance of action and world-building given the source material, but the directing decisions are just poor. Instead of building tension, they are becoming frustrating to the point of killing the tension they were meant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383633">
        to make.<br />
<br />
Spoiler ahead.<br />
<br />
Shion&#039;s death is one of the main reasons for which I&#039;m rating the show as I am.<br />
We&#039;ve been left in suspension wondering what have happened to her for 3 whole episodes, just to be told in one moment, that she is dead while giving us hope of resurrection, in a way, that it would be weird if it didn&#039;t happen.<br />
<br />
They could have feed us with despair for 3 weeks, instead they gave us one minute of sadness and rapidly cowered it with pleasant possibility. <br />
The impact of her death was dumbed down and lowered to the point as if it never happened, knowing that she will get revived soon enough.<br />
<br />
Reoccurring flashbacks and retrospections are not bad a bad thing if there is a healthy amount of them, but if there are too many, like in this case, it starts to feel as if the show has nothing to offer.<br />
<br />
Repeatedly reoccurring flashbacks, even from one episode back, dragged-out non important scenes. All in all, compared to previous season, I cannot rate it better than I am doing.<br />
If this was how the first season was made i highly doubt it would become so popular with all Naruto-filler-esque feeling it gives.<br />

    I went in expecting the worst, and it did not disappoint. As with the first anime, it is nothing but a power-tripping main character defeating your generic super evil villain which is designed solely for the viewers to hate. There is nothing of value to this anime, it only exists for the viewers to live vicariously through the main character.<br />
<br />
The characters are bland and shallow; there’s your generic female sidekick, another girl whose only personality is her breasts, and two generic males who we know nothing about. They all exhibit sameface; the only way we can distinguish them is the gaudy color palette used on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393809">
        each character: the main character is a bright blue, the main female sidekick is pink, the other girl is purple, and one male is red. They have no backstory; there is no emotional attachment to these characters, and as such, they can only be distinguished by their hair color.<br />
<br />
The animation is similarly of low quality. In one scene, they allocate two frames for a tiger-drawn carriage. Their paws just go up in one frame, and down in the other. In other scenes, you have your typical still frame fights, and panning shots of similarly still frames. I&#039;d wager that this video https://youtu.be/240Vq6tIxio has more keyframes than the two seasons combined. It&#039;s also obvious that the penultimate fight scene involving the main character is lazily animated. The main character&#039;s attack seems to have been designed to avoid having to animate complex moves.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about the story. It&#039;s your typical overpowered character power-tripping fantasy. We meet a few villains; most of them are framed as edgy, pure evil, with no complex personality; just someone that presents a barrier for the main character that everyone roots for to be crushed. The main character first faces off against a villain who overpowers him. He retreats and as he lost his sidekick, he suddenly gains more power, to the point where he can just massacre the tribe that said villain belonged to. After the initial confrontation with the main villain, she is nowhere to be found. Her entire tribe is massacred with her nowhere to be seen. She was only there to provide a minuscule bit of tension and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the conflict within the anime is weak, as the main character is overpowered. When some of the supporting characters died, there might’ve been hope for some tragedy in this story, to provide a little depth. But as expected, their deaths were not permanent. Through some plot device, the main character&#039;s sidekicks are magically revived, and all goes back to normal. To some extent, it plays out much like a sitcom. The laziest plot device of this entire series is &quot;the sage&quot;, a voice in the main character&#039;s head that is nothing more than an exposition machine. It powers the main character and grants him increasingly powerful abilities, in addition to spitting out verbatim exposition, with no attempt to integrate it into the story. The anime doesn&#039;t even attempt to animate an actual character to deliver said exposition; it&#039;s either a voice in the main character&#039;s head or a glowing sphere. He doesn&#039;t make much of an effort to acquire his superpowers either; they are just granted to him by the sage when the plot deems it necessary.<br />
<br />
All in all, this anime was nothing but another generic isekai designed for the viewers to live vicariously through the main character. It has no value; it&#039;s just another cash cow in a sea of mediocre anime. It&#039;s the poster child for modern anime: poor plot, terrible animation, bland characters, fanservice, nothing but pandering to a wide audience.

    Overall: 5/10<br />
As a big fan of the first season, I gotta say I was thoroughly disappointed with this season of slime isekai. Not only did we have ~3 filler episodes at the start of the series, but the overall pacing has been sub-par, especially when compared to the 1st season. Guess that&#039;s what happens when you&#039;re dangerously close to where the manga currently is and you&#039;re not planning on taking a long-ass break like Black Clover.<br />
<br />
What the 1st season excelled at, including pacing and the blending of action and worldbuilding, has been performed very mediocrely this season. However, I will say a lot of these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388181">
        issues can be chalked up to the horrible production Slime has gone through overall: for those that don&#039;t know, we were never supposed to get a season 2, but the higher-ups relented after seeing the success and popularity of season 1. <br />
<br />
Story: 4/10<br />
I still enjoy the premise of the story: typical isekai setting, but our reincarnated protagonist is very pure and wholesome instead. The 1st season was very clearly a wholesome take on the generic isekai genre, and this season was very clearly meant to start flipping that on its head. While that the tone did start to change this season, I can&#039;t say I was a fan of how it was done.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, season 1 was meant to be the only anime adaptation of the manga/light novel. As a result, it ended up skipping the content we see in the first 3-ish episodes. Why they decided to include this I have no fucking clue, since it didn&#039;t add enough development to the story to justify taking up ~3 episodes worth of time, especially when you consider the other content they chose to skip in later episodes that actually would&#039;ve provided more insight into the world, story, or other facets. If you consider how horrible the higher-ups behind Slime are, it&#039;s pretty clear that this shit was added to stall and milk more money.<br />
<br />
Aside from the filler episodes we got, the overall pacing this season has been subpar. Hinata vs Rimuru took much longer than it needed to, and I literally spat out my lunch laughing when I saw Myulan posing for like 3 minutes straight or so, just spitting out a very empty monologue. Like what am I watching right now? As I brought up earlier, moments from the manga were skipped for god knows why that could&#039;ve added much more depth. Myulan&#039;s romance with Youm was better developed: it feels very random in the anime. After the attack on Tempest and Rimuru&#039;s return, we had more interactions between Rimuru and humans willing to help like the merchant from Blumund: this provided way more character development for Rimuru that we never got to see in the anime. We also completely skipped Ranga and Gruciu&#039;s conversation about demon lords, which adds a LOT to worldbuilding.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, I absolutely hated how they handled Rimuru&#039;s interaction with the Falmuth army and king. The manga portrayed everything in a much more sinister, horrific tone befitting of Rimuru&#039;s rage at the time, while the anime went with a very light-hearted, and comedic even approach. In the anime, Rimuru has a long-ass civil conversation with the king before chopping his arm off. In the manga, Rimuru exudes a demon lord aura, before immediately cutting off the fat fuck&#039;s arm the second he starts talking big. The difference in directional choice here is staggering and baffling, with the overall direction for episodes 10 and 11 was decent at best, just like the pacing for the whole season.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
While the animation has been mostly nice, I was really 50/50 on the animation of Rimuru&#039;s attack on the Falmuth army. The animation for merciless and meggido was sick. But the animation (or lack thereof) afterwards was quite sad. <br />
<br />
I could list so many ways they could&#039;ve gone about making the episode much darker, making Rimuru more evil and scary, etc. etc. but I won&#039;t bother. I just implore you to check out chapters 65 and 66 if you&#039;re really interested. It&#039;ll give you a sense of how much violence/horror was censored and fluffed up in the anime (Geld vs. Shogo was significantly more bloody and gruesome than the animation made it out to be) as well as how much better content later on (compared to the first 3 episodes) that added to worldbuilding was skipped.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
Just like the animation, the sound and use of OSTs were good at most points, but there were some that really stuck out as being poor taste. Specifically, the music being played over Rimuru&#039;s slaughter using Megiddo. Why are we getting cheerful music here? This is supposed to be a very dark moment and a crucial turning point for Rimuru. Playing optimistic, happy music doesn&#039;t really fit in thematically at all. <br />
<br />
That being said, I will applaud Gobta&#039;s voice actor for killing it during the death reveal scene, and the use of OST in the background. Very fitting, and one of few actually dark scenes executed properly this season.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
A lot of crucial character moments were not done right or just outright skipped, especially for Rimuru the fucking protagonist of all people. <br />
<br />
Just look at chapter 66, and tell me Rimuru isn&#039;t an absolute chad or badass. He not only has to hold himself back from killing the king outright the moment they meet, but he constantly intimidates and pressures him, making it very clear who&#039;s boss and who isn&#039;t. Rimuru in the anime? Has some tea with the king, remains collected even when the king is spewing bullshit, etc. etc. We never see Rimuru close to snapping or starting to live up to his name as a demon lord. <br />
<br />
I get that Rimuru is normally supposed to be like this: calm, collected, willing to try peaceful options first, but the whole point of this arc was to show that even he could snap when pushed to his absolute limits. This is also a big turning point since he&#039;s gotta realize that peace won&#039;t be as applicable to everyone as he would like it to be, and also since he actually has to kill humans now. We just don&#039;t get this same character development in the anime. If I never read the manga, I wouldn&#039;t even assume Rimuru has undergone some sort of change: he looks and acts almost exactly the same as before.<br />
<br />
Even the crucial introduction of Noir/Diablo is rather subpar: we skip over a lot of his initial interactions with Rimuru after being summoned, which leads to rather mediocre character development for him. Likewise, a lot of small character interactions amongst each other or with Rimuru were skipped, which makes Rimuru&#039;s primary group seem significantly more one-dimensional than they actually are.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
This season of Slime is nowhere as good as the 1st season, especially when you consider how much better of a job they could&#039;ve done. If you truly want to enlighten yourself, I suggest you read chapters 63-68 of the manga: it&#039;ll really make you realize how many amazing moments were delivered in a sub-par moment or skipped entirely. Moments that I was really looking forward to seeing animated, like Rimuru&#039;s demonic aura and slaughtering of the army, were completely flipped around and ignored/replaced with much more light-hearted fantasy shit. Disgusting. Interesting and meaningful character interactions were forgone for 3 filler episodes. Again, disgusting. All that being said though, this season is a serviceable adaptation of the manga content. But that&#039;s about it: mediocre when it could&#039;ve been so much more, and that&#039;s more depressing than it is disgusting.
