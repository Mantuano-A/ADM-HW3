    Sangatsu no Lion&#039;s first five minutes contain a scene I might characterise as one of the best in animation. A boy listlessly wakens, drinking out of necessity, dressing out of obligation, and leaving his sterile apartment out of confusion, an existence so fragile it could perish with the wind. He doesn&#039;t say anything. He doesn&#039;t tell people about his problems. He just moves on with his life. <br />
<br />
At first I did not understand why this scene had such an impact on me. I thought it could have been the beautiful music, or perhaps the captivating artwork so characteristic of Shaft. That wasn&#039;t it. What overwhelmed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242894">
        me was how illustrative it was of human life. <br />
<br />
People often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;life-changing&quot;. Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all.<br />
<br />
To say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one&#039;s quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft&#039;s greatest accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Sangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series&#039; protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him.<br />
<br />
There is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people&#039;s happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei&#039;s problems, while significant and real, aren&#039;t much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei&#039;s journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.  <br />
<br />
Rei&#039;s eventual breakdown is one of the story&#039;s most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told &quot;no, you are wrong&quot; does not do anything to help fix a person&#039;s issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He&#039;s just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers.<br />
<br />
The scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only 90 seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei&#039;s growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still &quot;something&quot;. Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei&#039;s evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change.<br />
<br />
Many aspects of Shaft&#039;s production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode&#039;s shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn&#039;t require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It&#039;s nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo. <br />
<br />
The music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time &quot;Sayonara Bystander&quot; began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn&#039;t a reaction I normally have towards music.<br />
<br />
One could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters&#039; lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don&#039;t think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn&#039;t really in need of an ending. There&#039;s no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei&#039;s life and those of the people around him. His depression persists, and he remains an imperfect and flawed person, even if he now has friends and family by his side. He&#039;s still searching. He&#039;s still running. Perhaps that will change by the end of the second season or the manga. Maybe it won&#039;t. And that would be completely fine. I don&#039;t believe there is anyone, even on their deathbed, who has ever been complete as a person. We start imperfect, and we end imperfect, gradually, yet surely, evolving, unchanging.<br />
<br />
With most reviews, I feel compelled to discuss the anime in a mechanical way. &quot;The animation was nice&quot;, &quot;the characters were developed well&quot;, &quot;the plot was inconsistent&quot;. It is because most anime feel crafted, like a specimen of sorts to be examined. How is this piece? How is that piece? Sangatsu no Lion never felt that way for me. It&#039;s bigger. It feels more real. And so I can&#039;t help but write something more personal, too. <br />
<br />
Is Sangatsu no Lion better than Honey &amp; Clover? Maybe. Is it the best anime of the past decade? Perhaps. More than that? Could be. It is difficult right now to answer with complete certainty these questions I have been posing myself. Time is the best judgement, I feel. But I can say, without question or hesitation, that Sangatsu no Lion is the only anime since Touch that has had such a profound and visceral impact on me. And Touch was the best anime I had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Sangatsu no Lion is a statement that unhappiness is OK. Being depressed, unsatisfied or stressed does not make you weak - it makes you human. And so I find it appropriate to close with a quote from Hinata:<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you say at a time like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say to do your best.&quot;

    My opinion:<br />
To be honest, I’ve always found reviewing slice of life series to be difficult and unpleasant, doing it is just tedious.<br />
In recent years the anime production standards have steadily dropped culminating with the winter 2017 season which is filled with generic otaku-targeted shows, and thus 3-gatsu no Lion distinguished itself by having a more “serious” tone and being better, compared to the vast number of shitty series that aired at the same time.<br />
I usually avoid watching slice of life because, in most cases, the story is nothing special and the pacing is slow, leaving me unsatisfied and on the brink of falling asleep in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245178">
        front of the screen. Unfortunately that perfectly applies to 3-gatsu no Lion’s case.<br />
<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
3-gatsu no Lion revolves around Rei Kiriyama and his everyday life, portraying Rei’s struggles with his past as well as the difficulties he encounters as a professional Shogi player. <br />
<br />
With the show being part of the SoL genre, one can anticipate the story being dull with a fundamentally slow pacing that gradually tests your patience for the duration of the 22 episodes, and that it does.<br />
The story is simple, not original or engaging in any particular way, it holds no hidden messages or deep meanings and develops at a pace so slow that sometimes makes you doze-off in front of the screen. Well, to be honest, the show does hold a few &quot;hidden messages&quot; about family, life and such.<br />
The show’s plot just plods along, inducing a comatose state that is very difficult to recover from.<br />
<br />
To my pleasant surprise, 3-gatsu no Lion contains some drama as well as comedy having a few entertaining and gripping moments, covering and merging multiple tones, alternating introspective and dark scenes with lively and funny moments, features which helped progress the story in a more fluid way while the show did a fairly decent job explaining the Shogi game in a way that anyone can understand.<br />
The short flashbacks to Rei’s past were some of the very few things I liked about the execution of this show, execution that was tedious except for a few exceptions to the rule.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7/10<br />
Although 3-gatsu no Lion is a character-focused show I was not impressed with its performance in this category, not even in the slightest.<br />
The characters are decently built also being decently developed but at the same time they are stagnant and ultimately feel bland. I personally did not find the characters to be likeable or relatable to nor particularly deep or intriguing. <br />
<br />
Rei Kiriyama is a 17-year-old boy who had a harsh childhood during which he faced many difficulties and sad moments. The difficulties he experienced as a child traumatized him and drove him to become an introvert who spends most of his time alone, studying Shogi, game which is his “passion”. <br />
By meeting the Kawamoto family, the changes in Rei’s behavior and personality are put into motion, he slowly meets and starts to interact with more people while exploring his own emotions and getting to better know himself.<br />
Rei’s parents passed away due to a car accident when he was just a child, leaving him alone in a world he did not know or fully understand. After the loss of his family, Rei secluded himself in the Shogi game, considering he had nothing left aside from that game. No relatives were willing to care for him but fortunately, one of his father’s close friends was kind enough to welcome Rei in his home and treat him like part of the family, but in that man’s home Rei will continue to face difficulties and sadness, being resented by the other two children. <br />
While trying to escape from that pressure, Rei decides to live alone in Tokyo and work as a professional Shogi player in order to pay for his expenses. <br />
As the story develops so does Rei&#039;s character.<br />
<br />
Kyouko Kouda, Rei’s older adoptive sister, is a self-centered and egoistic young woman who has no real worries other than her relationship with Gotou (the bad guy), a married older man who also happens to be a professional Shogi player. <br />
Kyouko has no issues standing and watching Rei getting beaten by Gotou and when in need of help she has no issues going to Rei’s house looking for help like nothing ever happened. She is described as a “witch” by Momo, the youngest of the 3 Kawamoto sisters.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: 8/10<br />
The animation and art are beautiful as well as the color palette which is very nice, featuring colors according to the tone each scene employs and clearly conveying the feelings and emotions the moment carries.<br />
The character design could have been done better and there are some minor flaws in the animation but other than that I have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Both opening and ending themes are great, arousing and inducing a certain mindset for the viewer to have as well as setting the mood for the show.<br />
The OST is very good, working in tandem with the animation and perfectly conveying the emotions each scene carries. <br />
The voice actors did a great job interpreting the characters, I particularly liked the 3 sisters’ voices and also the voice of the pets.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
I’ve always said “Why watch slice of life when you can go out and do the real thing?”.<br />
Watching 3-gatsu no Lion was a fairly bad watching experience, the show being very dull but having some entertaining moments to maybe remember.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.4/10<br />
3-gatsu no Lion is a show that I found difficult to finish and that made me constantly feel like I was wasting my time. I would not recommend watching this show unless you are a fan of the slice of life genre or you want to fall asleep.

    3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft&#039;s other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei&#039;s journey. <br />
<br />
8/10 Story:<br />
The story resonates with me a lot. It&#039;s like a combination of figuring out life in the present and how to deal with your past at the same time. The story is more than just about shogi, it&#039;s more about the player. How he decides what pieces to use, what pieces to move, and try and overcome his next opponent/obstacle. It also applies to his life. He has his new family which currently guards him and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242870">
        his past (pieces he lost) which keep coming back to attack him. <br />
<br />
9/10 Art:<br />
This is pretty self explanatory. The art is unique and defines each situation perfectly. You can properly see how everyone is feeling in each scene. It&#039;s powerful and really makes you think back when you were hurt but then got through it thanks to a loved one. <br />
<br />
9/10 Sound:<br />
The opening/endings always seemed to tell Rei&#039;s story just by listening to it. Everything was made well to fit the mood. It wasn&#039;t forced like laugh tracks from 90s comedies but I knew when to smile, be sad, and root for them thanks to the sound. <br />
<br />
8/10 Character:<br />
As far from how much I like their characters, It&#039;s pretty much 10/10. The only reason it&#039;s an 8 is because some of the characters got underdeveloped in comparison to the main few. I love them all as characters from their realism, supportiveness, and silliness. Even the characters we know little about, I wanna know more about them cus they seem interesting. Rei&#039;s sister, Rei&#039;s future opponents, and pretty much everyones past. <br />
<br />
8/10 Enjoyment:<br />
3-Gatsu was that one anime I kept coming back to weekly. It was at times heartbreaking, heartrelieving, and at times very intense. I enjoyed the characters and the story that came with them, but at some points it was a little slow. I enjoyed it overall, and was happy as fk when they announced season 2 coming soon.  <br />
<br />
9/10 Overall:<br />
Another one of Shaft&#039;s animes that I actually liked. Hope you give this anime a chance because everything about it is relatable and enjoyable at the same time. <br />

    The way 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes like a lion) is written is like a poetic adventure. Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.<br />
<br />
The creator of the series is Chica Umino. Some people may recognize her work such as Honey and Clover. As such, character designs represented in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review242873">
        show may feel familiar. However, 3-gatsu no Lion stands out on its own as we are introduced to Rei Kiriyama, a young man known for his professional shogi talent. Rei may seem like a successful person at first glance but deep down, he suffers from many personal issues. The show explores those issues in ways that really makes us curious not just about his life but how society, relationships, and a career can influence a person.<br />
<br />
From the first few episodes, it’s clear that Rei has talent when it comes to shogi. People even label him as a prodigy with a unique gift. Yet, Rei feels isolated in society as his real parents no longer exists in his world. However, fortune does smile on him as he meets Akari, Momo, and Hina, three sisters with gentle hearts that welcomes him as their own family. I have to admit, those very first few episodes gave me a realistic impression of Rei’s character. There are those in our world where a prodigy can feel so alone. The expectations from their peers, coaches, and fans really put them on the edge when they deal with competition against rivals. For Rei, it seems even worse because of his unsociable personality and the fact that he has a strained relationship with his adoptive parents. On a professional level, his career hasn’t really bloomed in his adolescence years. Sound something similar? Once in a while, I’m sure we’ve heard similar stories in the news before too. Viewers coming into this show should really expect to see why Rei feels the way he views society and how he adapts to make his life better for himself.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of memorable moments in this show but perhaps one of the most influential is how Rei develops relationship with the people he meets. He’s not an outgoing person and most of the time, he seems to keep to himself. This is evidenced by the cynical thoughts and narratives he voices in his head. Often times or not, Rei has trust issues towards others because of his past. The show cleverly does a good job at storytelling as we see glimpses of his past in multi-chapter arcs. Rei’s personality is strongly influenced by his past that carries into the present. Fortunately, not everything is gloom and doom because Akari, Momo, and Hina brightens up Rei’s life. They are like the light of his dark tunnel and we see how they are able to give him affection and treat him like a real family. Their influence in the show changes Rei as he realizes that he can trust certain people. Rei also becomes more aware of how being together with people is better than being alone. That’s really what makes the storytelling and character of this show intriguing. We see the mistakes that Rei makes and life lessons he learns from. Rei’s confidence grows and he begins to develop meaningful relationship with others. <br />
<br />
Besides the Kawamoto sisters, the show also offers a colorful cast of other characters. One of the most noticeable is Kyoko, the daughter of Rei’s shogi teacher. Throughout the show, we learn the negative influence she has on him. The way this show expresses human emotions is most evident when Kyoko and Rei are in the same segments. To name a few, we got jealousy, hate, pity, among others. The way Kyoko taunts Rei can also get uncomforting to watch with her snarky attitude. What’s important though is to understand her role in the show. It’s not to just to make viewers despise her but also how Rei’s negative side is often bought out in the worst way because of her influence. <br />
<br />
That being said, the series also has a colorful cast of characters on the professional shogi scene. Rei’s self-proclaimed rival Nikadou brings in many of the comical moments between them. Kai Shimada, a man in the late 30s, also has influence on Rei as he learns quite a bit from him throughout the show. Masamune Goto, a man that has a very complicated relationship with Rei’s father stands out as a seemingly main obstacle in Rei’s life. From this series, Rei experiences different feelings when it comes to facing off against his rivals. The in-depth narratives accompanied by the inner thoughts from his shogi matches gives us even a better insight of Rei on the competitive scene. <br />
<br />
Now, I am not an expert on shogi but it’s fair to say that 3-gatsu no Lion knows its content when it comes to game perspective. While the show heavily involves psychology in those shogi matches, there’s also strategy that is narrated and presented. Colorful imagery is also added to make the matches look larger than life. Even though the show can feel very melancholic, it still has many moments where it can draw an audience’s laughter. The shogi matches, character relationships, and even non-human characters such as Kawamoto’s cats are just a few examples. In fact, the show seems to not forget any character throughout its recourse. Unfortunately, this 2-cour adaptation is simply not enough to cover everything. The manga is still ongoing and as faithful as this is adaptation is, there’s still plenty that are left uncovered. Perhaps another season can explore more options but in a span of 22 episodes, that’s not really happening.<br />
<br />
Adapted by studio Shaft, it’s pretty recognizable that 3-gatsu no Lion has its style. While Shaft’s iconic head tilts aren’t the main factors when it comes to art direction, it’s still very Akiyuki Shinobish. Inspirations are drawn from the flashy segments, dialogue usage, and background imagery are just a few to name. It feels experimental at times while demonstrating a superior feel of realism. One thing I was really impressed by is how almost every camera shot focused on Rei reveals his feelings. Character designs are influential by the author’s works and very faithfully adapted from the manga. That being said, Shaft’s art style may not be for everyone but for 3-gatsu no Lion, it hits the nail in the coffin. <br />
<br />
3-gatsu no Lion may not be a show about music but even its soundtrack works effectively thanks to the talent of its production staff. The melancholic atmosphere is well choreographed with cleverly timed OST. The theme songs very well fits with the show’s themes. In particularl, Bump of Chicken’s OP song “Answer” really bought out the psychology of the show. However, I think the biggest praise should be given to Rei’s voice actor, Kengo Kawanishi. The way he voices Rei makes him feel very believable especially during powerful moments. Voicing a character like Rei honestly feels difficult but he pulls it off without trouble. Finally, the show’s narratives remains strong throughout the show. Rather than relying on a narrator, it doe the storytelling itself with its characters.<br />
<br />
Watching 3-gatsu no Lion feels very different compared to some of the other shows I’ve watched in relating to exploring the growth of a prodigy. It not only has heavy characterization but the psychology of the show gives a unique feeling of its storytelling. The relationship building and realism really gives slice of life more than just every day adventures. Because for circumstances, every day is a challenge for Rei as he takes on himself. Whether it’s in life or on the competitive shogi scene, we can see how Rei develops as a person. I can’t safely recommend this show to everyone however. It’s definitely a show that isn’t for anyone’s taste and for manga readers, you may feel slightly disappointed by what’s still left out in the dark. Yet in the end, 3-gatsu no Lion is able to breathe life with its powerful direction and a story of compelling melodrama. <br />

    One of the most underrated anime of Fall 2016.  Overall rating [9.3/10]<br />
<br />
Story [10/10] - This is not your typical anime with exposition, climax, and resolution. It&#039;s like you are reading a book. And in this case, a very good one. The experiences come fast and furious for the main character, but the center of his universe is definitely &#039;shogi&#039;. Also, you don&#039;t have to be a shogi expert to watch this although it has a &#039;game&#039; tag on it. You will love how the story goes from silent to being dramatic, and from that to being so comedic. One time you will be crying,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233610">
        and then the next thing you know you&#039;ve been laughing along with the character&#039;s dialogues. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art [10/10] - I&#039;ve watched a fair amount of anime, and I speak for everyone when I say that this kind of art style is very unique. The way how every scenes were drawn into perfection, and how it can easily change your feelings toward the story make this anime one of a kind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound [10/10] - The opening and ending songs were performed by BUMP OF CHICKEN. So you can expect for it to be good. The soundtracks for every scene are on point. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character [8/10] - Although the main character has a deep background. It&#039;s not that rare nowadays for most of them to have a very tragic backstory. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment [8/10]

For starters, this anime could be close to a masterpiece. Why you ask? Well I&#039;ll tell you. It&#039;s animated by Shaft, who are known for extreme narrative and story abnormalities. Now that may sound bad, but the story so far has been directed beautifully. The way the story dives into the sadness of our MC&#039;s past really tugs on the heartstrings, but at the same time his current life is filled with happy moments that are heartwarming. The mix of drama and slice of life can get confusing or even annoying but I think that&#039;s just what makes this show really good.<br />
<br />
What is important to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233642">
        note is that while having a main character such as Rei Kiriyama, a tragic backstory is nothing original. One might find that cliche or distasteful; however the mystery of his past as well as the growth of Rei as a person is what makes you feel the emotion the director is trying to impose.<br />
<br />
You don&#039;t have to like or know anything about shogi to enjoy this anime. And trust me, there is more to this show than just shogi. Rei&#039;s everyday life is incorporated with happy slice of life scenes featuring the Kawamoto sisters (Akari, Hinata, and Momo). They help Rei understand the beauty behind life, and not just the struggles of it. Besides the story, the art is outrageous and surreal, but not realistic. Don&#039;t let that throw you off, because it still captures the moments of emotion in detail. The OP and ED are sung by BUMP OF CHICKEN (who are a very good band), and both songs are aesthetically pleasing and catchy. The characters and atmosphere make this show enjoyable as well and make you feel a part of the story. The OST helps with this, as it&#039;s vivid and picturesque.<br />
<br />
Overall, give this anime a chance. You might find something you&#039;ll enjoy a lot. [Will update this if the anime changes]<br />

    &#039;3-gatsu no Lion&#039; had a promising start but then lost it at the end of Season 1.<br />
<br />
*please note that this is only a review of season 1, i gave season 2 a 5/10*<br />
<br />
Story: 3 (Poor)<br />
I have to say that the beginning was very engaging. The idea of shogi and the struggles you could face mentally was a new concept to me. However, as the show continued, it became quite boring and repetitive, and that very quickly. Dialogues between the characters were becoming bland and it seemed like the creators focused on the gameplay dialogues &quot;move pawn to etc.&quot;, rather than the dialogues in crucial moments.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review346821">
        I feel like the lack of enthusiasm shown really made the show seem repetitive. A lot more could have been done with 22 episodes. It had such a good start but it didn&#039;t reach my expectations.<br />
<br />
Art: 7 (Good)<br />
At first glance, I was not a fan. But as I continued watching, I started really liking it. The animation is really beautiful and unique. Kudos to the animators!<br />
<br />
Sound: 6 (Fair)<br />
Background music could have been better.<br />
<br />
Characters: 2 (Dreadful)<br />
This is my biggest issue. Characters. I&#039;ll just say that there was no character development from any character. Rei Kiriyama might have had some, but it&#039;s not significant. And he&#039;s the main character. The show introduced bland, boring characters who were not likeable at all. I also felt like there were a lot of &#039;filler&#039; characters, as in characters that were introduced for the sake of having more characters. Why introduce them when they won&#039;t be interesting or get any development? Especially the main character and the three sisters. More could have been done with these characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 3<br />
Throughout the whole show, no episode or part seemed engaging or &#039;ooh, I think I should concentrate on this part&#039;. I took my time with this series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 3<br />
This anime was so disappointing. It had the potential to be a masterpiece but the pace and lack of development stopped it from being so. The flimsy plot and poor set of characters brought this show to a lower level. This is why I can&#039;t rate &#039;3-gatsu no Lion&#039; more than a 3/10.

    Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll try to be as spoiler free as possible while pointing out what I think worked and what not.<br />
<br />
Story: 3<br />
In a few words, the story in Sangatsu no Lion is &quot;playing shogi&quot;. For as much as I would like to say that it talks about a kid growing, fighting his fears, learning how to relate to other people, eventually understanding how to live one&#039;s life, all of this is just barely touched, focusing more on &quot;what if I moved the pawn in A7 instead of B2?&quot;. In 22 episodes, absolutely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review291968">
        nothing relevant happens. No epiphanies, no events, no change, or if something happens, it&#039;s brushed off in an incredibly simplistic way. <br />
We could think that since this is a Slice of Life, it reflects reality as it is, and oh, it does it perfectly. But please don&#039;t tell me that your usual, every day, routine lives are worth a series. Mine, is not.<br />
<br />
Art: 6<br />
For as much as I love shaft, the style here is pretty different from their usual. The colour palette, the watercolour-ish style, the animation itself were really pleasant to watch, as they give a warm vibe when it&#039;s needed, but doesn&#039;t work so well in the more &quot;cold&quot; scenes. Also, the classic shaft antics recur here as well, and maybe, they weren&#039;t so needed. What really bothers me here is the character design. From the beginning to the end of the series, the characters lose more and more punchiness and details, starting from a very specific character design (those mouths, really?) ending with a generic character from any other series of the last decade.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Not much to say here<br />
OTs and EDs are not so bad, but also not memorable. I finished the series half an hour ago and I already forgot what they sound like. Same goes for the background sounds and music. About the voices, the cast is galactic, it worked pretty well.<br />
<br />
Characters: 3<br />
Let&#039;s say you try to give an honest vote to your completely normal neighbour, or the guy that used to sit on the left corner in your classroom. That would be pretty hard, I imagine. The same goes here. The characters are completely normal people, but instead of having those many hues a normal person would have, they are just parodies of their &quot;IRL&quot; counterparts.<br />
The MC is the usual &quot;kind of problematic&quot; character. Introvert, social issues, no friends, focused only on shogi. You keep watching him doing nothing, saying a lot of &quot;I will whatever&quot;, then going back doing nothing. Just stupidly thinking about shogi. So much to forget to drink for days! Can you imagine that? <br />
The female cast is the &quot;obliviously-incredibly-good-and-sweet-girl-that-oh-so-love-to-help-you-for-whatever-reason-and-obviously-loves-sweets&quot;. As too often, the women in Sangatsu are put in the kitchen or related domestic areas, and those are the only moments in which you see them. Since it&#039;s a shogi anime, you could think there are also female shogi players, but no, the only one that you can see doesn&#039;t play anymore. <br />
Is the rest of the cast worth mentioning? the fat but passionate kiddo, the cold and invincible player, the mentor, the blonde with weird haircut guy?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/ Overall 4<br />
I think I said everything I had to, with very bad grammar and vocabulary, though, but since this anime has been so hyped up, I could not keep it in.<br />
Sangatsu no Lion fails on every front. It fails in narrating a story, even a slice of life story, introducing elements that will be lost in the next scene, breaking tragedy or tension with out of place comedy, but still failing with both of them. It fails with its characters, with too good or too bad people that could exist in other genres, or using cliched characters that, as usual, follow the flow with no question asked. It also fails with the art, lowering the quality episode after episode.<br />
<br />
So, there are a lot of way better anime out there. Go see them.

    Ever since Akiyuki Shinbo joined as director in 2005, Shaft has been on a rampage, pushing its avant grade cinematography (and head tilts) to the limits. And now that they&#039;ve made a name for themselves (and the fact that they&#039;re all out of source material on the monogatari series), they have started to calm down. Compared to last year&#039;s Owarimonogatari (and the subsequent Kizumonogatari movies this year), they have a Slice of Life entry this fall season by the name of San-gatsu no Lion (or March comes in like a Lion). Based on a well received ongoing manga, the story revolves around Kiriyama Rei, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233520">
        high schooler and a pro shogi player, living an independent life in a rather empty part of town. Having lived through a mountain of trouble as a child and not-so-good experiences at his foster family, the repressed emotions and lack of &quot;love&quot; (if you will) has made him depressed and lonely inside. The only thing he has left is his career as a shogi player, which, sadly, started with a lie. So, a life (and mental sanity maybe?) built on such a feeble foundation can only last so long. And so it all starts to crumble and he starts going into a downward spiral.<br />
<br />
But fear not, all is not lost yet. Enter the three Kawamoto sisters. Having gone through some rough times themselves, they had one another to lean on, and so they live their modest lives full of happiness and laughter with the occasional sad reminiscing. And thankfully, they drag our protagonist into it, and it acts as a sliver of hope in his life. His interactions with them and the subtle changes they cause in his personality seem to be the main focus of the show. <br />
<br />
Now, there are a few things to watch out for, if you&#039;re thinking of picking this up.<br />
Number one is the drama, the kind of drama where there are lots of tragic flashbacks and broken, damaged characters. If you find characters wallowing in depression appalling, this might not be your cup of tea. Though I would say that the creators have put a lot of effort in Rei&#039;s backstory as it feels &quot;legit&quot; and in-sync with his character.<br />
<br />
Second, is the game of Shogi. They say shogi is like chess, except that it&#039;s not (well it is, in essence, a strategy game). Compared to the 16 pieces per player in Chess, Shogi has 20 pieces; there is no queen, and two new pieces - silver general and gold general are in play. Even the board is different (its a 9x9 instead of an 8x8). Point is, if you don&#039;t know shogi, parts of the show involving it - like the surprised look on players when the opponent makes an interesting move (a shot of the board with all the pieces, a move, and cut to character&#039;s face), or analogies/metaphors relating to our main characters life, will probably make little to no sense (or won&#039;t have the desired effect).<br />
<br />
Number three is Shaft. Now, I already said that they&#039;re trying to calm down, and they are, I mean, 5 episodes without a head tilt (Shinbo must be screaming in frustration, good thing Kenjirou is in charge), but, it&#039;s still Shaft. And I&#039;ve seen some people complain about the artstyle. Thankfully, it all isn&#039;t as erratic as the monogatari series and I am fine with it. Heck I love how they keep the contrast when switching perspectives from the depressed MC to the cheerful sisters (love the color palette too, and the opening).<br />
<br />
Conclusion. I like where this is going. I like that the main character is &quot;damaged&quot; damaged and not just damaged for plot&#039;s sake, his backstory really gets me. And I am interested in how far down he is going to fall before he gets over his past or if the past is going to come back to haunt him, either way, he will face it and that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking forward to. Also, this is Shaft and I have hope that they aren&#039;t going to mess this up. But if they do, I&#039;ll update this.

    This review will cover both seasons of March Comes in Like a Lion.<br />
<br />
Well here we are my 100th review.<br />
<br />
It has been long and emotional road of great and awful animes but somehow I made it to 100 reviews. I personally wouldn&#039;t made it so far without your helpful and constructive feedback that you have given me over the years.<br />
<br />
Naturally I decided to do something special to make this occasion and So I decided up a anime that I truly loved and that anime in question is 3 Gatsu no Lion or March Comes in like a Lion in English. First aired in 2016 the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317281">
        has gained a strong following over the years for it&#039;s strong characterisation, masterfully handling of serious topics and fantastic art-style. <br />
<br />
I previously watched the series when it was airing and I loved it. When Aniplex announced and released the English dub for season 2 I decided to re-watch the series in it&#039;s dubbed form and I love it even more to a point where I ultimately decided to write a review for both seasons. It was that amazing. More about the Aniplex&#039;s Dub later but first let&#039;s talk about the plot and characters and why I adored it so much.<br />
<br />
The story follows a shogi prodigy named Rei who lives by himself. Despite living along Rei is far from a stable individual as suffering from numerous issues such as social anxiety, depression and loneliness that prevents him from connect to anyone due to his tragic past.<br />
<br />
He soon the Kawamoto family a trio of sisters and their grandfather who run a traditional Japanese pastry shop. They too have dealt with pain and loss. Now Rei must learn to socialise with other people and understate his triumphs and failures as human being in order to defeat his social anxiety and depression.<br />
<br />
Saying that the story of March comes in like a lion is outstanding wouldn&#039;t give this series any justice. This is easily the best put together anime I&#039;ve ever seen from this decade.<br />
<br />
Where do I honestly begin maybe with the first episode. This is easily the best first episode I&#039;ve ever seen in anime because not only it does an outstanding job at establishing Rei as a character by diving in social anxiety mindset. The first episode also does a fantastic job at establishing it&#039;s own tone to the viewers. The first 10 minutes of episode 1 has a melancholic feels that showcases the darker side of the series while the most of the second half of the series shows the more lighter side of the series where everything is all happy and bubbly. Normally this tonal combination would totally back fire but it didn&#039;t because March Comes in like a Lion understands tonal shifts.<br />
<br />
Out of the anime I&#039;ve seen March Comes in like a Lion is one of few series that is able to hand it&#039;s tonal shifts. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I had with Your Lie in April outside of the hamfisted executed themes and monologues was the tonal shifts that series had the worst tonal shifts I&#039;ve seen in my life because not that series were executed incredibly poorly as it pop out of nowhere (mostly thanks to Tsubaki) but it actually did more harm to an already problematic series. Episode 1 of that series was prime example of that issue.<br />
<br />
March Comes in like a Lion doesn&#039;t do any of that. It know&#039;s how it&#039;s dark and light tone well and it&#039;s know how to switch between theses two without feeling awkward or out of place. The tonal balance of March Comes in like a lion helps the comedy and drama flow better and speaking of drama let&#039;s talk about it.<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like a Lion is heart a drama. From the first minute of episode 1 season 1 to the last minute of episode 22 of season 2 we see the well crafted drama play out as it greatly affects every single character in the show. <br />
<br />
The drama also allows us to dive into the characters motivations and ideals for various characters and shows for a tremendous job of it. This is main reason why March Comes in Like a Lion is not a shogi sports anime. Sure the series has a lot shogi matches to a point where they were frequent tournaments that are filled with competitors who want to win however the show completely destroys the generic I want to be the shogi player like no one ever was as the show does a brilliant job at exploring the competitors true motivations of winning.<br />
<br />
Rei is a competitive shogi player that has to win various tournaments if want to support himself in life. He&#039;s not doing it for recognition, he&#039;s not doing it to be the best shogi player in the world he&#039;s doing it as a career to support himself, or he will be homeless.<br />
<br />
That not all March Comes in like a lion has to offer. The series is also a beautiful coming of age tale. In season 1 we see Rei as a depressed anti-social individual who is trying to live his life as a professional shogi player. However, thanks to Akari and the Kawamoto he starts to open up to people more to a point where he starts to help people with their problems in season 2 which I will talk about in a bit.<br />
When the show is not being a heavy character drama show becomes an engaging and grounded that is filled with fascinating character chemistry and interactions that only strengths the already strong characterisation of the series.<br />
<br />
Season one of March Comes in like a Lion is a masterpiece on its own right that can win various anime awards inducing anime of the year. Season two on the other hand takes the already masterful season 1 and takes it to another level. The majority of Season two is focused on the topic of bullying and how bullying can affect others.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, this topic was masterfully executed thanks to not only having some of the best writing to ever exist in this medium but it&#039;s also the subject with respect and care. Watching this bullying arc is like watching an actual human being getting bulled in front of your eyes. It was portrayed beautifully thanks to the brilliant direction and writing.<br />
<br />
Season 2 of March Comes in like a Lion is without the best anime squeal I have seen from this medium as it took everything that was brilliant in season one and expended to new heights. My praise of season two doesn&#039;t end there. The rest of the arcs in season two were also fantastic.<br />
<br />
They may not be as emotional compared to the bully arc but they are still strong arcs in the own rights. My favourite arc of season 2 not counting the bully arc is the Old Gen vs New Gen Shogi championship arc aka Sakutarou vs Shimada.<br />
<br />
Despite being the only arc of the series that focusing primarily on it&#039;s supporting characters which was a nice change of pace for the series it is a very a fantastic written arc that communicate the theme and topics of sacrifice, retirement, generation, and passing to torch.<br />
<br />
The visual imagery also enhances the mood and atmosphere of the match as this is not just an another typical championship shogi match. It is a match that would change two individuals as people especially on Sakutarou&#039;s end who despite surviving as a shogi kishou all those years had to see his peers die over the years just to get to that spot that he&#039;s currently at.<br />
<br />
March Comes in like a lion is not a just story it is a tale of ambition, passion, love and emotion that highlights the best and worst aspects of life in a more grounded way and for that reason alone as many others things I said before March Comes in like a lion is one of the best stories I&#039;ve ever encountered in any medium.<br />
<br />
The characters in March Comes Like a Lion can be best described as real human beings.<br />
<br />
At first glance Rei may appear to be another typical self insert tragic character that you have seen before however the series immediately throws that exception out the window. From Rei&#039;s emotional out bursts, unpredictable thinking to trying his very best to improve his social life towards others Rei is the embodiment of a flawed who&#039;s trying to improve his life before the world crashed down on him.<br />
<br />
His character development over the course of the series is historically amazing as he goes from an anti-social lone wolf who just wanted to play shogi just, so he can live to a more social and friendly person. Sure he still plays shogi just so he can live but thanks to character development we Rei go out of his way to help people in need. The best example of this is with the bully arc in season 2. Rei could have easily ignored Hinata&#039;s bullying issues by just ignoring them and continue playing he&#039;s shogi matches just, so he can live. Rei fortunately not only helps Hinata with her bullying problems he a sacrifice a decent amount of shogi time he&#039;s only source of income.<br />
<br />
Yes, it does hurt having a reduced income just to help a friend but Hinata and her family helped him defeat the darkness of depression in season 1 and that was a good trade off.<br />
<br />
This is my favourite aspect of March Comes in Like a Lion.<br />
<br />
Character development that is left intact across seasons.<br />
I have seen many anime from this decade where character development were not left intact across seasons/ story arcs. Certain shows will either repeat character arcs due the authors using a wonderful plot device that is called amnesia or even worst characters contradicting their development after they were developed in previous seasons/story arcs.<br />
<br />
March Comes in like a Lion doesn&#039;t do any of that. It perfectly develops its characters and that development stay intact across seasons allowing for more character development in future arcs.<br />
<br />
A perfect example of intact character development is shown with the second protagonist of the series Hinata.<br />
<br />
Hinata is the second of the three sister&#039;s of the Kawamoto family.<br />
In season 1 she&#039;s assisted Akari overcome Rei&#039;s depression and social anxiety in season 1. She becomes the primary protagonist in season 2 with the Bully and graduation middle school arcs and man she was a beautifully written character. The way she developed over the course of the bully arc was not only splendid site on to see visual storytelling perspective but it so relatable to the eye.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite being the victim of bullying she never gave her strong will to the bullies as she is reminded determined to shut down the bullies even it may hurt her mentally in the process.<br />
<br />
Add up her bubbly and determined and you got yourself a wonderfully crafted character that highlights the best and worst of life from a child&#039;s perspective.<br />
<br />
Finally we have the final main character of the series Akari.<br />
Akari is a fantastic character if I ever saw one. Akari is the guardian angel for because it wasn&#039;t for her then Rei still be on path of darkness and social anxiety. She was the only one that fully broke Rei dark shell. Yes Hinata and Momo assisted Akari into breaking Rei dark shell but Akari not only drag Rei out of he&#039;s dark shell into the light but she also only character that understood him of what he was coming from.<br />
<br />
Just like a person taking a orphan homeless kid into they home who has been mentally and physically damaged from they former orphanage. That&#039;s not all to Akari as character. In season 2 bully Arc we the viewer start to see signs of Akari being a broken individual.<br />
<br />
Despite being the mother substitute for Hinata and Momo she has faces has own struggles that affaced her as a person. In episode 5 Someji made a strong statement of Hinata&#039;s bullying situation which he said &#039;&#039;There is nothing wrong of helping a friend in need&#039;&#039;. That statement affected her as mother figure because compare to him she doesn&#039;t have the strong will to deal with theses things due to pressure.<br />
<br />
As the arc progressed Akira starts trying to be a strong mother figure who doesn&#039;t let pressure talk over her mentally.<br />
<br />
 Her character development in the bully arc is showcased at the climax of the bully arc with Taiga&#039;s mum. The way she conflict to her showcases how much she has grown as a person On top of her incredible character development across the season&#039;s she&#039;s a very nice and caring person who tries her hardest to people in need hand that&#039;s the reason why she&#039;s my second favourite character in the series.<br />
<br />
The supporting characters are just as great and complex as the main characters. They all that have they quirks and personal struggles that plays off with the show core themes. Some personal favourite characters include Shimada, Harunobu, Touji and Takashi.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters in March Comes in like a Lion are just as fantastic as the plot.<br />
<br />
Studio Shaft is known to have fantastic production values that add more detail and flare in they and March Comes in Like a Lion is no different. The artistic direction and the use of sharp/soft colour palette really brought the world of March Comes in Like a Lion to life. <br />
<br />
This is only enhanced with the gorgeous animation that is filled with emotion and atmosphere. Naturally this is a shaft production so you can expect their signature pops of colour and head tilts. It may be random but unlike all other shows from Studio Shaft they don&#039;t abuse it all that much. Add this up the show&#039;s fantastic visuals storytelling that only strengths the show core themes of depression, emotion, bullying and sacrifice and you got yourself a beautiful series that is style and substance. Great job Shaft.<br />
<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like A Lion visual presentation is only made better by the wonderfully composed soundtrack done by the very talented Yukari Hashimoto.<br />
<br />
Melancholic and soft tracks perfectly set the mood and tone of the series. The emotional tracks that played in the series only strengthen the narrative and presentations as when there is an emotional moment the tracks rises up just to amply the emotional moments in the series.<br />
<br />
 <br />
This is thanks to the March Comes in Like Lion fantastic sound direction. It knows when to play various tracks at the right moments and it knows how to fade in and fade out the tracks at any given time. <br />
<br />
All the opening and ending themes were incredible as not only the songs are great it has a lot of symbolism that accurately captures the show&#039;s themes. <br />
<br />
When I heard, that Aniplex Of America was going to dub both seasons of March Comes in Like A Lion I was very excited how the show was going to fare in it&#039;s a dub. Needless to say, the dub of March Comes in Like a Lion didn&#039;t disappoint me one as this is one the best dub I heard for Aniplex it also, in my opinion, surpasses the already amazing original Japanese audio.<br />
<br />
 Despite many of the English Actors not having previous roles, they managed to bring out A game as every single dub actor did a tremendous job with the roles that they were given. The best performances in the dub were the rising stars Kayli Mills as Hinata and Khoi Dao as Rei. Overall if you are looking for a great dub that is on par with the original Japanese audio I strongly recommended the dub.<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like a Lion is a series that impacted me of not only how I view anime as a medium but it also impacted me as a human being. It is a series that soul-crushing broke my heart but the same rebuild it with it&#039;s wonderful characters that represent the highs and lows of humanity and life. The beautifully crafted story arcs that have a purpose, masterfully written characters that were well written, the fantastic production values that was only made better with the beautiful melancholic soundtrack.<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like a Lion is not just an anime it&#039;s a masterfully created human and thematic study that would make any cry and because of these reasons March Comes in Like a Lion is not only the best anime I have seen from this decade but it&#039;s also one of the favourite things ever.<br />
<br />
Yes, there were others anime from this decade that I called masterpieces in the past however they all palls in comparison to the beautiful piece that is March Comes in Like Lion which is a true masterpiece of an anime that changed my life forever.<br />
<br />
Thank you Studio Shaft for making this masterpiece a reality.

    SHAFT previously installed a pretentious series that suffers from a massive diagnosis of what I like to call dialogue schizophrenia, making a guy with ahoge hair look cool while he continually sexually assaults lolis; it reined in unlimited amounts of money, yatta yatta (muting the preface point with that because this studio is the bane of my existence).<br />
	<br />
Still riding on the Bakemonogatari cash cow, I&#039;m sure that they realized that adapting one of Chika Umeno&#039;s works (the mangka behind Honey &amp; Clover), along with adding the overzealous, overly angular, dialogue heavy monologuing with a sexually ambiguous, teenage misfit boy that this would be a self-defining

          <span style="display: none;" id="review288247">
        hit among narcissistic, Tumblr normies. I&#039;m 100% sure that they weren&#039;t blind to their potential viewers.<br />
	<br />
I mean, they surely didn&#039;t know that the internet would fill Reddit forums with social justice powered, too deep for you conversations and people would GIFing the overly artsy and talkative moments, right? Let me clarify this for those you who didn&#039;t know, just because something is pretentious and artsy DOES NOT mean that it has any substance! The package is often different than the content. Just imagine if A-1 had directed this instead of SHAFT.<br />
	<br />
I thought it was high-budget trash, quite frankly. If you want to see tons of money put into in-your-face conveyances of depression while watching a rather privileged orphan whine to himself in exaggerated monologues while he’s allegorically drowning, than this is the series for you! This show is the primary example of what we you would call &quot;victim culture,&quot; which I absolutely hate about modern day society. <br />
		<br />
I say privileged, because the unrealistic degree of how nice people are to him is uncanny. I understand people being nice to someone because their mother, father, and little sister died. And somehow, to make it more dramatic, they show Rei, the main character, looking at their corpses in the morgue? Who lets a child look at their family&#039;s bodies like that?<br />
		<br />
But, back to my point about the weird way every single character bends over backwards to make Rei happy, no seriously. EVERY time Rei is depressed: his teacher, a family that takes him in like their own, and a rich kid that he beat in shogi either talk about how great he is, or give him back pats.<br />
		<br />
I&#039;ve seen this before, I mean MC privilege is a dilemma prevalent in anime. It frustrated me, because it was like a self-insert fan-fiction or like Tommy Wiseau from The Room with side characters that I like to call “two-dimensional-encouragement-puppets.” But it frustrated me more, on top of everything, that main character still angsts dramatically with internal monologues. Many people on the interwebs even find this little shit &quot;relatable&quot; or &quot;likable&quot;. One of his angsts were that his adoptive father loved him more than his two ACTUAL kids (***MC privilege***), so his step-sister was violent and made, what seems like consensual, sexual advances at him.<br />
		<br />
I know that realistic teenagers like to wallow in their own sadness, and feel alone and alienated, but is this something that should praised? No. This is why teenagers are often made fun of. The main character is such a genius at shogi that it is stated in the show that he makes more than his HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. What does he have to complain about? <br />
		<br />
He has:<br />
•  A professional shogi career.<br />
• Unanimous accolades from everyone, except his bipolar step-sister.<br />
• A family who unconditionally loves him and takes care of him, even though he&#039;s not related to them by blood.<br />
•  Friends and a school teacher that go out of their way to cheer him up.<br />
			<br />
As someone who was adopted, I would have killed to have my life laid out so cleanly in front of me. Where are these all of these allusions to suicide and self-hate even coming from? People complained about the melodrama in Your Lie in April, but at least there was a character that was dying from a disease, that, you know, had a reason to angst or freak out. <br />
		<br />
The banality of this series is astounding, Rei loses a shogi match and doesn&#039;t eat for days and more allegorical drowning. I get that he&#039;s a child genius, bordering on Asperger&#039;s, perhaps? Who knows? The series doesn&#039;t really clarify what the hell is wrong with him. It got better toward the end of the series, because it focuses on other characters like Kai Shimada (he has Kaiki Deishuu&#039;s voice actor) that made it bearable. <br />
		<br />
This anime could be categorized along with the Monogatari with how absurd it is. I mean, there&#039;s angst, then talking cats, depression metaphor then cute girls making food and talking about cute stuff. SHAFT treats you like you&#039;re some kind of intellectual when they go into the 3deep5me fucking dialogues ー that the main character has with himself. He&#039;s like one of those goths that writes poetry by candlelight.<br />
		<br />
Overall, the visuals are pretty and music can be enjoyable at times, except when they insert precocious French music in episodes for no real reason. This series is what it would look like if a hack art student had gallons of money to dump into a project like SHAFT, who not-so-secretly embodies the spirit of an avant-garde student that lives in Calabasas, CA.<br />
		<br />
I give it a 2/10, though barely that. I nearly dropped this garbage because of how silly and immature it was. I felt like putting my head into a cheese grinder after every episode. You would need a bidet and a degree in licking assholes to enjoy this show.

    Story 5/10 <br />
Since the show has a good rate I forced my self to watch it but I didnt feel anything from the show but a little motivation that shimada and rei may give me. The progression of the story was slow alot of characters r presented but they didnt do much or play a real role for the show and aswell their developpement was poorly made (like misumi, takahashi, tsujii, hanaoka...) Animals speech are pretty not necessary since they speak for nothing... Mostly jokes r really really bad i never laughed after watching those 22 epsiodes but i guess comedy isnt the aim of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317318">
        the show. However the story about a young adolescent who has lost their parent in a accident but thanks to shogi and his relatives managed to find a reason to live and to change his life is decent.<br />
<br />
Art 3/10<br />
I hate the art and the way they draw characters expression when it came to joking... So childish and annoying.<br />
<br />
Music 3/10<br />
Musics r bad they arent made to be listening many times. I put 3 for the first op of the show.<br />
<br />
Character 5/10<br />
I dislike so much Nikaidou omggg and all of this over reaction he got. Didnt like Hayashida aswell i find thay he lack of charisma for a teacher, his reaction is so chiddish sometime. And Misumi and his cat (what does the cat do in the show ? Nothing ! Exactly just like Misumi him self ;) ) However i still put 5 for Shimada who inspired me alot for his motivation and his determination for shogi.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10 and Overall 4/10<br />
Didnt enjoy the show because above :D. I found the rythm was very slow bc of those characters that doesnt have a real impact in the story.<br />

    Dear MAL members, do not be fooled like I did by the high score that this series obtained.<br />
<br />
Spoilers ahead<br />
<br />
I came across this anime which not only obtained an overall high score, but also received plenty of high scores by other reviewers. Hence I was excited to watch this series. However after finishing all 22 episodes, I was left disappointed and wondered what did this anime have that deserved the high scores it obtained? <br />
<br />
Unlike run with the wind, whereby they made running interesting, this anime made shogi look difficult and boring to someone who does not know about the game. The rules and how the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312753">
        game is played is never really explained other than a brief introductory in the form of using cats to make it look cute. The creators of the anime seems to be talking down to the audience as they literally have to portray the rules of shogi being explained to kids. <br />
<br />
I felt that they could have spent more time in explaining the rules and gameplay<br />
more in detail like having a new Shogi member whom just join the association being shown the ropes, instead of that few minutes of explaining to the two kid sisters on how pieces move. The reason is because we are being informed a lot of time throughout the anime, of technical jargons such as 7c rook which without knowledge of the game or proper introduction, the viewers like myself are left wondering what they all mean<br />
<br />
Shogi aside, I also do not understand a few things about the anime. Why is there a need for the mc to attend school? It is shown a lot of times that he would rather be somewhere else like attending a Shogi tournament than be in class. Is it to show his human side like him wanting to have a normal teenager life? If that is the reason, it seems counterproductive as it shows him having disdain towards his fellow students. Instead of reaching out to them, he eats by himself during lunch. They did show him attempting to reach out to his classmates but in the end he falls short of actually making contact with them but shows what he perceives as will happen in his mind and decides not to approach them instead.<br />
<br />
If this is how the mc is going to behave, why bother showing us his pass childhood as what is happening now is the same as when he was young. Is it to make the viewers empathise with him? After all this is the lifestyle he choose and he seems to be happy with it so why does the viewers need to relate with him? <br />
<br />
Back to my question of why the need to show the mc attending school. It is definitely not about him passing his exams to obtain his certificate for his future career because we have been told he already chose to be a professional Shogi player whom apparently earns more than his teacher. Is it to make friends in his life? If that is the case than why didn’t he actually bother to attempt to make friends? All we are told, the answer to him attending school is to experience high school life like this is some sort of plot amour so that this anime could incorporate high school for the sake of it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of making friends, there is this three sisters and the other Shogi player Nikaidou that he did make friends with. Why the need to go to school to make more friends when he already have those which he could strengthen the bounds with. The school part could have just been cut out of the anime as it serve no purpose other than to show that the mc values Shogi above all else including a normal teenager life. I feel that the time the mc is shown as attending school should have been given to those four as it make more sense in character building.<br />
<br />
If the anime wants to include drama besides Shogi, I felt that there should be more development among the mc and his foster family instead of the story of the other Shogi player Kai.<br />
<br />
Overall if you like me who still do not know what is 5d pawn, 7c rook or 2f knight, after watching this anime, I would advice to skip this anime. This anime is neither good in explaining the game Shogi nor portraying a good drama.<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s difficult to review slice-of-life shows through a critical lens. It&#039;s the one genre that is seemingly immune to poor reviews, simply because as long as the show is comforting, then it&#039;ll get a good score. I particularly like it when slice-of-life intersects with progress. Last year&#039;s Comic Girls did that, as well as Barakamon a few years back.<br />
<br />
One of my first favorites when I became an anime junkie was Hikaru no Go, which also centered around a competitive board game. With 75 eps and a controversial ending, it has largely faded from memory today. But it was enjoyable, and Hikaru had significant growth throughout

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303059">
        its run.<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like a Lion explores much of Rei&#039;s past. But I felt empty when the show didn&#039;t use this past to really affect the person he is now. And at the end, I felt the same way he did. Nothing much got accomplished during S1, and I didn&#039;t feel Rei had grown as a person. Instead, he was still wallowing in self-pity. Without significant progress, S1 felt like a disappointment.<br />
<br />
It didn&#039;t help that the humor in the episodes felt completely forced, as the artstyle turns into chibi silliness. This is supposed to relieve the view from the seriousness of Rei&#039;s depression, but I felt it was out of place and more annoying than how it was used in Your Lie in April.<br />
<br />
Hikaru no Go inspired a generation to learn Go, including more than a handful of western fans at anime conventions. I don&#039;t think March Comes in Like a Lion will do the same with Shogi. I hope S2 impresses, I really do. But S1 was a slog to get through with its strange chibi takes and generally inconsequential cast.

    This review is for people who don&#039;t like Slice Of Life anime and find them boring and unbearable to watch but want to venture into the world of Slice Of Life anime.....This is NOT the anime to start!!<br />
<br />
I ventured into this anime hearing good things about it from all sources such as people recommending it online ,the fact that it won at the cruchyroll awards and also that fucker The Anime Man praising it<br />
<br />
Plot/Story<br />
When it comes to anime , im all about the action and higher meaning even sprinkle a little symbolism... But the story, for me,  was too dull. I mean its slice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313896">
        of life and i did not have any high expections to start with but the plot here was all dull. It fails to grab the watchers attention in my case,Kiriyama who is an expert shogi player has the attitude of someone who has just given up on life,he is just so dull ,so unenergetic that he makes you feel the same way too when you watch. Kiriyama&#039;s tragic life story begins later on but by this time I was so uninterested to even care but for the most part,the plot is kiriyama going to his shogi matches,kiriyama going to school, kiriyama going to akari&#039;s place and helping them with whatever problem they have. But seriously this Anorexic kid&#039;s pitifull state of mind was the most off putting thing<br />
<br />
Art/Sound<br />
The art is good for the most part,I really like and appriciate the small things such as momo&#039;s design suiting her personalitiy,and the cats etc but there are certain things i don&#039;t like ...such as the fact that i HATE the way kiriyama&#039;s mouth is shaped .....sometimes especially when he is annoyed its really bad. The voice Acting was Superb! Couldn&#039;t have asked for better.... all the voice actors were so in tune with their characters and it was just a perfect fit espcially momo ,the cats and Kouda<br />
<br />
In the end I&#039;d like to state again that i wrote this review for a very niche group of people but you are free to take from it what you will.thanks for taking the time to read this

    Sangatsu no Lion is filled with important life lessons that is taught to us in style. It has great music, quality animation and a fantastic art style. All of this added with the writing makes for an experience to say the least.  I want to also mention that the first episode of this show made my heart ache pretty hard and it didn’t take long to understand why.  I felt like I understood Rei’s character quickly because I was Rei at one point. I did everything not because I enjoyed it but because it was necessary, I was unsure of what I really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326671">
        wanted to do and how I wanted to live. I felt like I could disappear at any moment and no one would notice. Communicating with others was a chore and all I could really do is sit there and stare blankly at the person I was supposed to be communicating to. Looking back, it honestly felt awful. <br />
<br />
Story/Characters/Writing (9/10):<br />
<br />
The story of Sangatsu no Lion can be simplified to it being a story about life, but it is much more intricate than that. Like shogi there are many different pieces involved each with different roles to play. The author used shogi as a tool to give the viewer more insight on the characters and on life, this is done very well. Rei is the character who rightfully gets most of the character development. Other characters like the Kawamoto family is also focused on but nowhere near as much. I was completely fine with this as I was much more interested in Rei than others. The side characters are well used to further develop Rei’s character while they themselves get developed little amounts at a time.  My biggest problem with this show was its comedy. Although it may not be tagged as a comedy, there was still a considerable amount of comedy in it, and it was very hit or miss. Sometimes it got a chuckle out of me, other times it just felt forced. <br />
<br />
Art/Animation (9.5/10):<br />
<br />
Each episode is presented to us with unique visuals that reflects what is being said perfectly, this all thanks to studio Shaft’s creative way of adapting works. Each time they switch styles it doesn’t throw me out of the experience, in fact it makes me feel more involved with the characters. They somehow made each style perfectly embody what the characters were trying to convey.  Although I’m usually not into the more bright, bubbly type of art akin to shoujo works, I felt this was done extremely well. <br />
<br />
Sound (8.5/10):<br />
<br />
The voice actors did a wonderful job portraying their individual characters. Almost all lines I felt were delivered very well and held the emotion they were supposed to. The soundtrack was also very good. It was done by Yukari Hashimoto the same composer as Penguindrum, once again she delivers a wonderful soundtrack. I feel this one was even better though because of what Sangatsu no Lion is. I especially love the delicate piano pieces. <br />
<br />
Overall (9.1/10):<br />
<br />
This is very good, more than that even. I think this first season of Sangatsu no Lion was a considerable amount better than the second season. I could relate to it much more than the second season making it much more emotional than the second season. It has fantastic writing, its art and animation is too good, the voice cast is great, and the soundtrack is also very great. The only thing that held this show back from getting a higher score was its comedy. <br />

    “The further you go, the steeper it becomes, and there won’t be anyone around you.” – Rei Kiriyama<br />
<br />
I feel I lack the vocabulary and eloquence to adequately express how special Sangatsu no Lion truly is, but i&#039;ll attempt to do my best nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Depression is a silent battle. Constantly waging war against yourself. What happiness you can grasp is constantly sinking into an ocean of nothingness. You are nothing, you have nothing. <br />
<br />
Sangatsu no Lion does not shy away from showing it&#039;s viewers the reality of the soul crushing torment that depression is. The protagonist of the story isn&#039;t a faultless man embarking on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317565">
        the hero&#039;s journey, he&#039;s apprehensive, unsure of himself and engulfed in loneliness. Although this may be the case, Rei is a hero. A champion for the broken, a beacon in the night. He is you and I. <br />
<br />
Rei&#039;s battle with depression is captivating to say the least. Losing his family and being adopted into another, he uses shogi to appeal to his foster father and gain his approval. Through his immense talent and hard work he becomes a professional in the shogi world, but as a side effect he alienates his adoptive father&#039;s biological children. He then decides to live alone and chase after shogi, isolating himself. It&#039;s at this point that the story begins.<br />
<br />
The vicious cycle of win or become nothing becomes Rei&#039;s life. He isn&#039;t satisfied with how things have turned out but he continues to press forward because that&#039;s what is expected of him. His life has essentially become a vice as he suffers quietly in solitude.   <br />
<br />
The show is by definition a sports anime and doesn&#039;t shy away from that fact. Even if you were to peel away the dramatic story elements, the direction in the each shogi match is stellar. Every move is tense and efficient, as the players place their shogi pieces down with a satisfying clack, demanding the other player acknowledge their move. It&#039;s all extremely atmospheric, and you feel as if you were sitting right next to the board. Chika Umino has a deep understanding and respect for shogi and it definitely shines through.<br />
<br />
Now, to pivot back to story elements.<br />
<br />
The world of professionals is cutthroat and Rei soon comes to realise that the only way for him to remain one is to douse the hopes and dreams of each opponent he defeats. But why should he? Why should he be the one to attain victory? Why him? <br />
<br />
Through all the uncertainty, self-doubt, self-loathing and pain, a figure appears and lends a hand to Rei as if to pull him from the depths of his mind to start anew. Akari, Hinata and Momo Kawamoto are thrust upon him.<br />
<br />
Like Rei, the Kawamoto&#039;s have also experienced loss, the tragic death of their mother has left them incomplete. Broken but united, the Kawamoto family embraces Rei as one of their own. Through all of the pain, Rei begins to learn of the struggle of others. The Kawamoto sisters are as human as he is, they also all share the pain of losing a loved one and this commonality bonds them to each other. Scenes of Rei surrounded by the girls and simply having a conversation were enough to bring me to tears. The only way I think I could describe Rei&#039;s relatonship with the Kawamoto household in words would be &#039;sweetness&#039;. It&#039;s this same sweetness that Rei must separate himself from as he feels he isn&#039;t deserving of it.   <br />
<br />
Depression is an irrational beast by nature and overcoming it is a arduous process. Through all the success he&#039;s achieved and friends he&#039;s made, he still feels lonely. This is the painful truth of mental illness. However, Rei decides to leap forward into the abyss and towards finding his own undeniable happiness. To say Rei&#039;s journey is inspiring would be an understatement. As someone who has battled with chronic depression for a majority of their life, Sangatsu no Lion portrays how isolating and painful it can be perfectly.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen Sangatsu no Lion criticised for it&#039;s slow pacing while I on the contrary believe the slow, methodical building to be a necessity. Each character has a role, every dialogue exchange and scene has a purpose, to have such a unique and dynamic cast of characters would be impossible if it weren&#039;t for that fact that they all have backstories and lives that are completely fleshed out and interesting. You can&#039;t rush greatness.  <br />
<br />
As this is an adaptation, an animation studio must adapt it. Shaft&#039;s unorthodox approach to storytelling has often been hit or miss with me, ventures like the Monogatari Series often take a wildly esoteric approach to storytelling. The director of said series, Akiyuki Shibou, steers the ship that is Sangatsu no Lion. At a first glance I was definitely worried that he would employ the same over the top, no holds barred direction style that he&#039;s come to be known for but to my surprise he shows a more restrained, thoughtful direction style. Characters in close-up slowly turning to one another, quick cuts of a noisy shogi player fidgeting, it all lent itself to the atmosphere quite well, suffice to say I was surprised, even beyond that I was thoroughly and consistently blown away by his direction. Paired with Chika Umino&#039;s visionary level of storytelling, Sangatsu no Lion became a living, breathing creation. The art and music perfectly compliment each other as you feel chills run down your spine in tense scenes and your heart filled to the brim in the Kawamoto house. It&#039;s all masterful.<br />
<br />
Through all of the suffering and anguish, the clouds will eventually part and you&#039;ll be exactly where you need to be, this is the powerful sentiment the show carries. Misery is combatable, you just need to be brave enough to face it. There is beauty in life, you just need to be able to see it. <br />
    <br />
Sangatsu no Lion might be the most powerful piece of media I&#039;ve encountered to this date and for that i&#039;m eternally grateful. <br />
<br />
Please watch this show.<br />

    WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW<br />
<br />
March Comes in Like a Lion. The show that disappointed me in a multitude of ways. Having already seen (and reviewed) the second season of Sangatsu No Lion, this review will be rather short. Indeed, I feel as if everything that the second season does and fails to do, the first season does in almost exactly the same fashion, albeit in a way that manages to be less engaging, more frustrating, and ultimately less deserving of a high rating. Indeed, it’s very hard for me to see this season as anything more than an average show that I wanted to love and was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339011">
        disappointed with time and time again.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the basics. This show, produced by shaft, tells the story of a male Shogi prodigy who learns about relationships as he navigates life as a young professional. This premise is actually really interesting and unique: when was the last time your last MC made it through on professional board game playing? Rei comes from no privileged background, he has no untold prophecies surrounding his birth, and generally avoids some of the tropes surrounding shounen/seinen protagonists. Yet he somehow fits many other tropes: entire family died in a tragic accident at a young age, has a foster family that resents him, lives alone and broods over the city in an isolated training dojo. Maybe I could turn a blind eye to this if the rest of the anime actually came across as the slice of life that MAL has listed in the Genres category, but it doesn’t. Rei’s entire life is one of battle after battle punctuated by angst and attempted comedy scenes. <br />
<br />
But no, one says. You’re missing the point: 3-Gatsu is about relationships and learning how to live with others. That, I can say, is true, but the show fails to provide good character development requisite to such themes. The show involves a huge breadth of characters that are shown as little more than skin-deep. I’d like to take the Kawamoto household as an example. Although improved significantly in the second season, Hinata is little more than a source of distraction to both the audience and the MC, with the writers contributing to her character a vapid interest in sweets, shogi, and anything else related to Rei. Surely the death of his wife and daughter, along with the disappearance of his grandchildren’s father and his role as major provider for a sizeable family, would lead to some interesting insight into Someji’s story? Oh no, he only exists for some comic relief and to spur Rei and Nikaido on. Akari’s role as stand-in mother for her own two sisters, along with her own task as provider rather than following her own dreams? Nonexistent, because according to the writers, all she cares about is her own cooking. Even Momo seems to be present only for cute preschooler appearances and to remind Rei about his own departed sister. <br />
<br />
This superficiality is particularly frustrating when you realize that Shaft is capable of good character development, but places it in all the wrong places. Every opponent that Rei faces is carefully scrutinized and analyzed with 100% focus that soon dissipates as soon as he inevitably wins the match or loses and returns home to brood. If only the writers could develop the other main characters, or heck, even the protagonist himself, with such intensity! Instead, they are relegated to supporting roles, either to supply filler episodes while Rei does his thing or to provide bizarre, poorly-draw caricature insert scenes that I think are supposed to be funny or something. If you’re like me, you’ll probably laugh just because how out of place they are. Even the actually interesting and round characters – Shimada, Gotou, and Nikaido come to mind – somehow remain endlessly on the fringes, given frustratingly little further development. <br />
<br />
I’d like to return now to the main point that I made in the review of the second season, as I think it rings true here too. 3-Gatsu is a superhero anime masquerading as a slice-of-life. Rei behaves so incredibly unrealistically that it’s hard to see otherwise. Neither I nor the vast majority of the people reading this sentence are capable of supporting ourselves, in high school, by playing exceptionally good board games, winning against seasoned veterans while a curated rival spurs us on. Yet we are capable of retreating within ourselves, having difficulty forming and creating good relationships, and dealing with loss and heartache. I feel that Shaft tries to make its viewership identify with Rei through the latter characteristics, but still attempts to show his superhuman powers by means of the former. Perhaps this odd juxtaposition of incredibility and believability is attractive to some people, but I found it hard to live with. I said this before and I’ll say it again: I think this anime would have been significantly better if it was about a normal, unremarkable kid navigating loss and building relationships, without the need to defeat boss after boss in a game of prodigious power and skill. Or, alternatively, not marketed as a slice-of-life at all and given all the free reign of fantasy that so many superhero anime already show.<br />
<br />
I think I’ve said all that I want to about the first season of this show. My second season review (first ever on this site!) is a far deeper look into my criticisms of this series and covers in depth some of the same points that I alluded to here. I realize that this show is incredibly well-received, at least on MAL, and giving the show a 5/10 might seem suspect, but in my opinion the show’s many shortcomings surpass its limited strengths.  <br />

    I&#039;m Brazillian, so I&#039;m not very welcomed with writing in another language, I ask you to be patient with my grammar and my English :). To summarize, Sangatsu no Lion is a seinen, very similar to a slice of life so if you don&#039;t have quite alike from this genre than it&#039;s better to think twice before watching it. The story maybe not be the best one, but it&#039;s great and delivers us the best of its premise. The art (as you may see) it&#039;s outstanding, we find beauty in her simplicity. The moments of tension are well animated, for example, when the characters are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356556">
        being suffocated by a situation, we can feel it with them by means of the art, and by the immersion that the anime passes. The characters are consistently written, focusing, of course, Kiriyama Rei, the protagonist, an adolescent with a lot of problems (anime classic). However, this DOES NOT make it like any other seinen. When I first saw it, I thought that a shogi anime would be fucking boring, but I&#039;m glad I was wrong. The level of immersion is absurd, so I enjoyed a lot this show, and, the things I most liked, were the lessons that the anime passes, principally about valorizing the small things around you (as cheap as can sound). So I put this in a DEFINITELY MUST WATCH LIST. <br />
<br />
<br />
The overall is 10 so I hope all the enjoyment you can take from this anime.<br />

    Talking about Chika Umino&#039;s work is hard because her writing is something that always hits me very strongly. The way she describes mental illness, anxiety and youth problems is something absolutely touching and sometimes agonizing because, at least for me, is really relatable. Honey &amp; Clover is my all time favorite manga, but this time, 3-gatsu animation is somehow a different kind of Chika&#039;s work. Relief happens less often and the excruciating feeling of drowning in negative feelings is more constant. Episode six was hard to watch non-stop. Maybe because now it&#039;s a story mainly about sadness, loneliness and depression. And that is actually something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233654">
        impressive. Even though I don&#039;t really understand nor think about Shogi as an interesting sport/game.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10) is my favorite part, just like in H&amp;C. Her style is so cute &lt;3 I love the details of the eyes, the cute animals, and now, the TALKING animals! Oh gosh, so much cuteness for my heart to handle.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10) is simple, yet quite pretty. I barely noticed the background soundtrack - and I always do it strictly! Guess the story steals all the atenttion from it. Also, the dubbing is awesome! The voices of the characters fit perfectly, especially the female voices - that are also very cute.<br />
<br />
3-gatsu is about Rei&#039;s pain, most of the time, and this end up building our point of view about the rest of the story and the other characters (9/10) in a very strict way - probably because all the narration of the history until now was made by the protagonist only. But all of the characters are unique in their own way and full of characteristics that hold our affection with the passage of time. And these characteristics are so real that it&#039;s hard not to feel close to them somehow.<br />
<br />
Story (10/10) is amazing and yet kinda hard to go along with. The pace is purposely slow - and that makes it sometimes really deep and tense. Still, that is a perfect way to demonstrate how depression works, it&#039;s a perfect way to show to the viewers how hard is to feel anguished like that, how difficult it is to have a mind so full of thoughts and fears like this. I was positively surprised by this story that deals so well on the subject of psychological illnesses in a such intense and emotional way. After being so disappointed with various Japanese anime/manga that treat mental illnesses as banal or irrelevant things, watching 3-gatsu was somehow inspiring. I saw myself in various problems that Rei had, I could feel in my skin how scary some moments he spent were. And a show that creates empathy towards this issue is fantastic and without a doubt deserves all the credits. <br />
<br />
Probably not everyone will like or even truly understand it, but I think it was worth the time for all those who have been teenagers without friends at school, and didn&#039;t know how to express their feelings or had family problems/losses. <br />
<br />
3-gatsu is a story about trusting others, discovering your own strength and weaknesses, about letting it go and moving on.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m very glad I&#039;m having the chance to follow this series and I can bet some will like it as much as I do. And I really hoping for an emotional and very happy ending full of tears, just like Chika did in Honey &amp; Clover.
