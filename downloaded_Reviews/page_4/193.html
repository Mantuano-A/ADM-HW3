<br />
Many people will be confused by that statement, especially as the show is very clearly labelled and marketed as a children&#039;s series, and as everyone knows, kids shows are rife in anime. The problem, however, doesn&#039;t lie in the fact that this series was initially aimed at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22100">
        children, no, it lies in the fact that this is one of those rare anime where age boundaries are no longer relevant.<br />
<br />
The majority of people may not consider that to be a problem, however one should remember that whenever a series is labelled as a kid&#039;s show, the majority of older audiences will automatically avoid it, regardless of how good it is (and before you ask, yes, I have done this too).<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin is based on a series of light novels by Uehashi Nahoko, a name that fans of Seirei no Moribito should recognise. Directed by Hamana Takayuki (Toshokan Sensou, Sisters of Wellber, Chocolate Underground), the anime adaptation, like SnM, follows the plot of the light novels as much as possible.<br />
<br />
The story is about a 10 year old girl with green eyes called Erin. She lives with her mother Soyon in Ake Village, a place where creatures called Touda (large, lizard-like animals with horns), are bred, reared and cared for. Soyon works as a &quot;beastinarian&quot;, and is considered by many in the village as the best, and Erin, who is a quick learner and very clever, wants nothing more than to follow in her mother&#039;s footsteps.<br />
<br />
Fate, however, is a cruel mistress.<br />
<br />
This series is truly remarkable in several aspects, not the least of which are the scope and complexity of the plot and the huge amount of detail in the story. At 50 episodes though, it&#039;s not surprising that the series would have a good deal more depth than the norm, however in this case the fact that the show is based on a series of books also plays a major part. The story itself covers a number of disparate, seemingly unconnected, threads and, as the plot progresses, these are deftly woven together to create a tale the likes of which hasn&#039;t been seen in anime since the advent of The Twelve Kingdoms.<br />
<br />
Now one would think that an adaptation of a novel would feature some decent writing, and Kemono no  Souja Erin is no slouch in this department. The pacing and dialogue are all exceptionally well handled, and the plot is allowed to flow rather than to stop and start. That said, there are some recap episodes scattered throughout the series, however rather than simply being a simple cut and paste episode, there has been a conscious effort to include these as part of the narrative.<br />
<br />
And speaking of narratives...<br />
<br />
One big surprise while watching this series (at least for me), was the narration of the story. Throughout each episode there is a voiceover providing summaries of certain events and occurences, both historical and otherwise, however it&#039;s the style of the narration that is surprising as, at times, it can make one feel like they&#039;re listening to a fireside fairytale rather than watching an anime.<br />
<br />
One of the sticking points for many people is the look of the series. Goto Takayuki&#039;s character designs, while being charming and expressive, reinforce the perception that this is simply a kid&#039;s show due to their simplicity. The backgrounds and settings are unusual in that the series adopts a simplistic, yet stylised, approach, giving the anime the feel of a picture-book for the most part. <br />
<br />
The animation throughout the show is very good, and both characters and creatures move in a very natural manner. There is also a small amount of cel shaded CG in the show (they just couldn&#039;t resist - it&#039;s a Production I.G. series after all), however this is limited to the Touda and Beast Lords. There are also some extremely good visual effects throughout the series, especially where creatures are concerned, and these add to the quasi-mystical element of the series as a whole.<br />
<br />
One unusual aspect of the visuals is the artwork, and by this I don&#039;t mean the backgrounds. While Kemono no Souja Erin is marketed as a children&#039;s show, some of the artwork, while being stylised, is actually quite graphic at times. Violent scenes are sometimes depicted in a manner similar to animated cave paintings or aboriginal works, however there are also occasions when death and violence are shown in a straightforward, no nonsense manner. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve heard it said that this series is sanitised in certain respects in order to appeal to children more, however I have to disagree with this argument. The depiction of how the kingdom of Ophalon fell is, by the standards of any kids show, very graphic indeed.<br />
<br />
In terms of sound and music, both are very good throughout the series. The show makes great use of aural effects, from the crooning and growls of Beast Lords, to the rumbles and wistling screams of the Touda. The effects provide the anime with a depth that is often missing from other &quot;kid&#039;s shows&quot;, making the world more alive, more real.<br />
<br />
The voice acting throughout the series is exceptional, with the biggest plaudits going to newcomer Hoshii Nanase. Her protrayal of Erin possessed a charm and brevity that is surprising given that this is her only anime role. The rest of the cast, all of whom are experienced seiyuu, are equally as good, which makes Hoshii&#039;s achievement all the more impressive. As far as seiyuu go, one can fairly expect good things from her in the future.<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin is one of those shows that not only uses music as an emotive tool, but also as an integral part of the story. Thematically the music ranges from some rock style guitar tracks to melodic piano and harp pieces, with a number of different styles and renditions used throughout. While this may seem like a haphazard approach, the wide variety of tracks available works extremely well throuhgout the series, often enhancing the mood in an extremely subtle manner.<br />
<br />
One key thing about the music though, is the OP and ED, as the series has two of each. The OP  for the entire series is called &quot;Shizuku&quot;, and from the beginning up to episode 30 the track is performed by Sukima Switch. From episode 31 though, the track is then performed Hajime Chitose, and adopts more of a kabuki style than the previous Peruvian flavour. The first ED, &quot;After the Rain&quot; by Cossami, is an upbeat, yet slightly bittersweet, ode that has a distinctly childlike feel to it. However, from episode 30 onwards the ED changes to &quot;Kitto Tsutaete&quot; by Takako Matsu, a track that is both more melodic and more mature. This change is actually significant in terms of the series, and not something that has occurred on a whim, and by the time you reach episode 31 you&#039;ll understand why the ED was changed before the OP.<br />
<br />
As for the characters, suffice to say that Kemono no Souja Erin has some of the best development I&#039;ve seen of a main character in anime. While the majority of characters are developed to greater or lesser degrees, the show is focused on Erin in particular, and her growth from a ten year old girl to a mature young woman is handled in a sensitive and realistic manner. Granted the series has periodic time leaps and some episodes focus on other characters, but these are very minor deviations from what is effectively a continuously developed character. I haven&#039;t seen this much concerted growth of one character, well, ever to be honest, and that&#039;s part of the beauty of the show. The fact that it devotes so much time and care to Erin, but doesn&#039;t ignore the other characters in favour of this, makes for a character that you can truly care about. <br />
<br />
One thing that did standout for me though, was the amount of symbolism ascribed to each of the major characters. The Queen&#039;s symbolic nature is mentioned heavily in the series, as is that of the Beast Lords and Touda. However, there is one major symbolic aspect that many people miss because it&#039;s so obvious. Erin&#039;s name means &quot;wild apple&quot;, and as everyone knows, the apple is the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. When one considers Erin&#039;s life throughout the series, her inquisitive nature, curiosity, and non-conformity make far more sense<br />
<br />
A point about Nukku and Mokku though. While their inclusion is very much comic relief, they are noteworthy for providing Erin with a sense of continuity, and their continued presence is more to help with her development than to amuse the audience.<br />
<br />
So don&#039;t hate them too much please.<br />
<br />
I will be honest and admit that I was both surprised and enthralled by Kemono no Souja Erin. The series is both charming and original, and while there is a degree of sanitisation to make it appeal to children, this never actually goes to the point where adult would be put off watching the show. The anime is adventurous and playful, yet sombre and deeply political at the same time, one of the many dichotomies and conflicting ideals that occur within the series, and it&#039;s great to finally watch a series that harks back to those around when I was a child (e.g. The Mysterious Cities of Gold, Ulysses 31, etc). Nowadays they may not be considered decent viewing because of how they look, however those shows, like Kemono no Souja Erin, all had a deep and complex tale to tell, one that was far more mature than most would initially believe. <br />
<br />
That said, it&#039;s a given that some people may not enjoy this show. Fans of Seriei no Moribito should definitely try it, as both series are equally enjoyable for very different reasons. The show may also appeal to those who want something charming, yet with a little bite to it, or to those who are looking for worldbuilding in the style of Twelve Kingdoms. <br />
<br />
A word of warning however. Younger children may not enjoy this series as even though much of the violence is stylised, the aural effects and music enhance the visuals, and all three give the imagination a good old kick. Older kids may enjoy the series though, especially as it&#039;s one of those rare anime that doesn&#039;t assume it&#039;s audience is made up of morons who need everything explained to them.<br />
<br />
This show has pretty much everything one could want from a series: politics, love, betrayal, assasination, history, religion, war, friendship, joy, sadness, terror, a touch of mysticism, and more besides. <br />
<br />
Given the content though, I can only wonder how anyone could consider this to be simply another &quot;kid&#039;s show&quot;.<br />

    [Edit: This review was written when I was still at episode 14. The anime turned out to be a real gem, a true masterpiece. Hopefully my review was a help to get you watch this amazing anime. &quot;Kemono no Souja Erin&quot; was my best random pick. Finally being able to finish it, I am glad that my short review during the premature stage (then still a very new show and just started) got many fans interested, and by the time it finished airing, entered Top 100 Anime of all time. But to all honesty, this anime is worth a place in Top 20 in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14405">
        shelves of Anime Masterpieces.10/10.]<br />
<br />
First of all, don&#039;t judge an anime by its art-work and NO, this is NOT a children&#039;s anime.<br />
<br />
Before I start writing a review, here is a quick advice: Watch the First 6 episodes and then rate this anime and tag it as a children&#039;s anime if you want. After watching first six episodes, you will not be able to avoid this anime anymore, because it happened to me and now i know how wrong it would have been if i dropped this anime without even going to the main storyline.<br />
<br />
Short Plot:<br />
<br />
The plot is set in a world of fantasy beasts. Erin, a ten year old orphan is the lead character of the anime. Her father, the son of village chief had long passed away leaving her mother Soyon, a beast doctor when Erin was a toddler. Brought up in a single parent family by her mother Soyon, Erin is a quick learner, and everyone loves her for her intelligence she has been gifted with. <br />
<br />
The village breeds and nurtures wild beasts called &quot;Touda&quot;, in our world, it appears to be a larger species of Komodo. Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_dragon  <br />
<br />
Erin&#039;s mother Soyon looks after the Toudas, the fearsome beasts that are used for military purpose. Great wars have been decided by the superiority of touda-army and thus upbringing toudas have become a profession of many villages. Erin, with her amusement and delight watches as her mother Soyon looks after toudas. from aka-chan (baby) touda to monster kiba (huge touda reared up using special treatment and care) Soyon looks after many of these wild beasts and the best beast trainer and beast doctor in the village.<br />
<br />
However, Soyon always faces harsh remarks from some villagers as she has been from the Kiri tribe. The Kiri tribe is a tribe that isolated themselves from regular people for long and rumors say they rely on forbidden teachings and beliefs. A notable appearance of the Kiri tribe is that, they have midori (green) eyes and hair, which Erin genetically got from her mother.<br />
<br />
But most of the villagers love hardworking Soyon and her lovely little girl Erin, as Erin&#039;s energy and enthusiasm runs through every corner of the village and her presence can be felt always.<br />
<br />
Erin, growing up with the teachings, the wisdom and the warmth of her mother, and days ahead are full of promises as she decides to follow her mother&#039;s footsteps and become a beast doctor herself until....<br />
<br />
(this is where you pick up the anime from, episode 6)<br />
<br />
Review: <br />
<br />
The story is by far the best in recent times. this anime has so much to offer and I am amazed with the settings it made up (first 5 episode) before turning into an absolutely heartbreaking and at the same time heartwarming story.<br />
<br />
Most of the characters are already developed, it is only Erin and the two sons of the duke, and the heir to the queen, Seimiya who are going through the age of development.<br />
<br />
The sound is amazing. the background songs give a nudge of tenderness and at the same time fills your heart with warmth.<br />
<br />
The animation style is different and probably the reason why this anime scored so badly. I myself decided to hang up this anime after watching the first 3 episodes since I didn&#039;t like the animation style at all. but I had plentiful time and ran out of ongoing anime and decided to give a go after a friend suggested me that i will miss it if I don&#039;t pick the show up. <br />
<br />
I did and watched two more episodes and thought &quot;Is it really worth it?&quot; I am glad I decided to give another try, but was telling myself episode 6 will be the last if this anime doesn&#039;t pick up any pace. And boy am not i glad that I did!<br />
<br />
Episode 6 and onwards have been absolutely amazing. I am now at episode 14 and cannot wait for more. This anime is probably the best anime of all the anime that started since January 2009 and sad but true, people will overlook this anime because many couldnt bear the slow pace of the anime at the start and above that, there is this animation style.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime has been almost a masterpiece.

After I received a small hole in my heart after watching The Twelve Kingdoms, I was searching around for a nice fantasy anime with a certain scope and detail in a fantasy setting.  I did not know that my small open wound would be ripped further and leaving me *gasp* in further pain; anime is my heroin.<br />
<br />
[review begins]<br />
We begin the story that would have had the typical children&#039;s story feel, yet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36448">
        as the memorable character Erin encounters her major lessons in life particularly of death and passing, she develops a strong trait of maturity and her resolutions after each trial is really admirable.  Yes, Naruto might have a similar lesson, but the story of Erin is something that I find more invoking of feeling and somehow more consistent as she continually remembers her saddening past and tackles the future.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The presentation of Erin is without a doubt unique, with its rustic-fantasy themed colors and selection in music.  The only potential flaw that I see in the series is the continual reuse of certain scenes.  Everybody&#039;s tolerance differs, but even as a person who might finish a 20 minute episode in 5 minutes (hell why not read the manga), I found myself watching through 99.9% of each episode.  The pacing is that good.<br />
<br />
In terms of pacing, the series has two time skips, which implies a total of three sections to Erin&#039;s life (about equally divided throughout the series).  Each segment of Erin&#039;s life is again, well-paced with enough development in each episode to seem seamless.  There are two filler episodes however, before the third time skip and I skipped over them to get into the real meaty juicy part of the main plot.  What one should note, however is that Kemono no Souja Erin is an anime with several layers and three very different stories.  In the beginning is the childish dream/anime that is similar to the story of a small blonde haired girl who lives in the mountains.  As we progress it&#039;s the academic life of a beastarian scientist, and finally it&#039;s the story of a national hero who is involved in court intrigues and romance.  It is this miraculous bilsdungroman across genres that I think makes Erin not just a 9.8-star anime, but a 10-star.<br />
<br />
The realistic lessons and involving, touching lines, dynamic character portrayal, and a plot that is just &quot;so right&quot; all deserve a good watch.<br />
<br />
[warning]<br />
There is the end of my review, and I have to say, I was really finding myself in withdrawal, but I&#039;m more seriously addicted than I ever expected...this is more serious than heroin<br />
<br />
PART II<br />
...<br />
I find that one of the more critical, compelling, and powerful moments in a series, just like human life, is in its poetic end.  This series has been adopted from a series of novels, and as expected, the level of a conclusion of this anime is to me, so touching.  Hell I&#039;ve been crying throughout all the sad parts in this, and the last time I can remember crying was that first pokemon movie when I was really young...heck<br />
<br />
This series to me has been a really moving piece with a similar impact to the Studio Ghibli movies, only that the artistic force has been slowly growing since each episode.  To me, this is one of those animes that I will remember and cherish, a true masterpiece in my eyes.  <br />
<br />
I think that I&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s not the special effects and sophistry of an imagery that makes a series worth watching, but the cumulative effects that pass to its viewer a deep sense of understanding.  It appears to me that this anime focuses on a very beautiful story on the nature of relationships between species and the question left unanswered- will human relations be the same?  This is a question I&#039;ve also considered and I&#039;m sure that many others have also wondered, thought, and perhaps gave a small sigh of despair.  <br />
<br />
I think that this is a masterpiece with a few small flaws if one considers them flaws.  The messages throughout this series become increasingly complex and always emotional and powerful.  How will I ever find an anime to match this I wonder (funnily I was watching Morbito: Guardian of the Spirit) before this (same author and animation studio(?) I believe).  It&#039;s just a small coincidence.<br />
<br />
Again, I think that most can understand and truly appreciate this series.  It goes beyond simple &quot;character development&quot; and the sense of realism and life is apparent.  I do hope that you&#039;ll all take the moment to enjoy this experience.<br />
<br />
Thank You~<br />

My mistake, there were actually 3 time skips ;)

    Prologue:<br />
<br />
Lands bound by Magic, Lore, and Myth brimming with fabled creatures and tall-tales are the life force of fantasy-based works. Works of Fantasy tend to be products of pure imagination; the bridge between “what is” and “what can never be” often makes these works innately tantalizing. They have the ability to transport the audience into the fantastic, the absurd, the unreal, but, magic and trickery of the imagination displayed in effective works can invert these “fairy-tales” into something that feels far more real.<br />
<br />
The aforesaid effectiveness depends primarily on one element when it comes to Fantasy, and that is world-building. There is nothing that single-handedly matters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219187">
        more within this genre than its setting and the internal mechanics and laws that bind it. Consistency plays a crucial role here. Among the creations that have excelled with this element thoroughly – both internally and externally – one truly stands out as a defining work within the animated medium, and that is the tale of Kemono no Souja Erin or Beast Tamer Erin. <br />
<br />
And the tale goes something like this:<br />
<br />
I.     The Girl with the Emerald Eyes<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away lived a girl named Erin with bright emerald-stained hair and eyes. Erin lived in a simple town, with her mother and friends, where she spent her days quelling her curiosity. A quick-witted child Erin was, with a never-ending desire to learn. <br />
<br />
Erin’s town was like any other small town in the old days, but one thing that set it apart was that it bred and nurtured creatures called Toudas (wondrous reptilian-like creatures), which were the military force of the overseeing kingdom. The town and its people were responsible for the well-being of these beasts, and no other person was more fitted for this responsibility than Erin’s mother. She was a Touda specialist and a descendant of the clandestine Mist People (who are feared and isolated for their strangeness and rumored magical capabilities). Immune to the realities of her world, young Erin dreams of nothing more than to follow in her mother’s mystic ways, but then, one day…<br />
<br />
An ill-fated event forces Erin into an unknown world torn between beast and man, where her realities, dreams, and fears all collide simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Thus, the 50-episode series - adapted from the fantasy novels of Uehashi Nahoko - chronicles the evolution of Erin and her world through a superbly crafted coming-of-age tale. <br />
<br />
II.     The World &amp; its Dwellers<br />
<br />
The world of Erin looks like one out of an old medieval fairy tale: filled with rustic, pastoral towns’ part of a bigger kingdom nestled in lush, scenic landscapes stretched under an ever-changing sky. The subdued use of cool and warm colors keeps the world pleasant to look at, and it’s also accompanied by fitting music. The frequent use of lutes, harps, and other stringed instruments are used to create a very appropriate atmosphere that not only refines the world but enriches it. <br />
<br />
These small towns are ruled over by a Queen whose empowered by legend and divinity. There are intricate social, political, and historical nuances interwoven throughout the narrative that function to explicate the world. The lands feel enchanted, but they also carry a sense of closeness because of the universal struggles that define them, such as the ongoing political strife between kingdoms, or the perpetual battle for control waged by Man on Nature. Yet, none of this is imposed in a detached, impersonal, or heavy-handed manner, rather explored through the eyes of the inhabitants and creatures that dwell in it. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the fantastic or magical element in this series is also very well handled, for even though the realm is based on magical properties, it never once uses that to be lazy or as a device of convenience to introduce or resolve a plot point or character dilemma. This allows every facet of the show to shine on its own, and every element then builds the world further, better, and expands it beyond its own horizons with a swanlike grace. Consequently, the narrative not only maintains its world cautiously but advances it with a consistency that is imperative in a work like this (The gaps inherent to any work of Fantasy have to utilize some mode of reconciliation so that the viewer is able to walk that bridge, [willingly] suspending their scrutiny, and allowing them to sink into the world being presented. That persuasion has to manifest consistently). The internal mechanics effectively keep the world tied together with candor and believability. <br />
<br />
Not only are the internal mechanics of the world woven with a master’s stroke, there are some external additions that heighten the “fantastic” feel. For one thing, the story is often narrated by an aged sounding woman, who often introduces, recounts, and explains the story in an eerily familiar way. This gives the feel of being literally told a story, and then slowly falling into the rabbit hole of events as the pages turn. Often time, external narration can feel jarring or alienating, but the way it’s utilized in Erin is incredibly fitting. This bedside storytelling sort of keeps a nostalgic flame of “story-time” burning throughout. <br />
<br />
Besides the narration, much of the story is reflected through the eyes of Erin, and her friends (human and non-human alike). The world of Erin is indeed one to praise, but the cast is no less impressive. There is a diverse range of characters that accompany the plot of Erin, and all of them are individualized in a manner that speaks not only to how well they are “developed”, but to the overarching world and plot: everyone feels necessary and has a role to play. Motivations are extensively explored, thereby making most characters greater than the sum of their parts, and not easily definable with black and white terminology. Yet more than motivations is the relationship and bonds created between the characters that really add elasticity and dimension to the respective personalities. As a result, there isn’t much superfluity to be had or cardboard cutouts to fill up space which makes the cast fairly dynamic, with purpose, and entirely enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Yet, it would be a disservice to the work to leave it at that. It must be noted that Erin herself is one of the best-crafted characters I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing within this medium. The phrase “the journey is sometimes more important than the destination” perfectly captures how Erin’s characterization is approached. A huge part of character development relies heavily on this “journey”, and the series handles this with the utmost excellence. The prime reason for why Erin’s character is so effective is the balance of internalization and externalization. Effective development depends on many elements but these two factors really play a difference here. They can basically be thought of as internal, unsaid characteristics (internalization) versus how those elements are then externally embodied (externalization). How Erin’s, and by extension, her journey are presented are one of the same; one cannot separate the two, and a perfect example of the two aforesaid elements. This keeps her character steadily palpable while fleshing her out with proper momentum, and eliminating any obtuseness or ambiguity. This often translates into the viewer fully empathizing and understanding the character, because they can comprehend the situations being presented, and more importantly, feel as if they are a part of the journey that Erin goes through. <br />
<br />
III.    The Moral(s) of the Story<br />
<br />
The most interesting bit about this work is that it’s marketed for children, which explains some of the nostalgic factors, devices, and generally simplistic philosophies/presentation. This, however, is a gross understatement since Erin features some intensely dark moments, and mature themes that can be reduced for argument&#039;s sake, but when holistically evaluated, are quite heavy. This isn’t actually that surprising since many of the tales we encountered during our childhood are layered with complexities that if re-explored would probably retune our initial perceptions. Erin too follows this format, without the sugar-coats. If there is light, there too must be dark - as children, the latter part often gets understated, but it still exists, and Erin embraces that entirely without falling back on “magical” happiness. Even though everything comes together, Erin focuses on what it takes to get there, thereby moving beyond the “and they lived happily ever after” conundrum. This is why I hesitate to call this purely a “children’s show”, and would much rather opt to call it one with universal appeal. <br />
<br />
Essentially, the world of Erin is one full of wonders and complexities, but it conveys many things at heart that are powerfully human. There are plenty of themes and “morals” that are internalized smoothly with the characters and plot, and thus, feel a part of the narrative. For example, the depiction of man’s continuous struggle with the elements (including him/herself), and the powerlessness and devastation brought upon by such a struggle is depicted in a way that’s unparalleled. Much of this is shown in a very “as is” light, but along with the implications of what such a dichotomy entails. Yet, it’s unlikely to remain just observers. The series does a splendid job garnering complete investment in the problems, and nuances of this world without force-feeding any of it. <br />
<br />
Mushishi is probably the only other series that I can think of that translates that specific theme/struggle as potently as Erin does. Of course, the difference in how the stories reconcile and resolve this struggle is extremely different but the undercurrents of each tale flow similarly and naturally together, as the river to the sea. <br />
<br />
IV.    Sticks &amp; Stones, and Farewells<br />
<br />
It’s obvious that I’m a huge admirer of Erin, and have an immense amount of respect for everything about it; from its writing to its atmosphere. However, as with anything, it isn’t perfect. The biggest issue with this series is undoubtedly the pacing. First, there are a rather unhealthy amount of flashbacks infused into the work, which makes the series feel a little dragged out. Whether the intent of these flashbacks is to continuously be informative in nature, or for emotional impact, the frequent use of them feels a little manipulative, and excessive. Second, due to constant reiterations of past events, the slowness of the series becomes quite tangible at points, which gives off a very imbalanced impression. It’s not enough to go into full filler territory but often treads on the line between necessary and filler. <br />
<br />
Even with its slow-seasoned, and at times, repetitive nature, Erin transcends all of its flaws effortlessly. <br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin  is truly a testament to the power of imagination - one that that revamps the fantasy genre’s lore and law - and should be experienced by all for its enchanted lands, mystic dwellers, superb story, and of course…<br />

        any sort of overarching structure. It is merely my personal thoughts and things I&#039;ve realized while watching the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin’s story can easily be enjoyed on the surface level, but I feel that there is far more lurking beneath the surface. Despite initially appearing as a simple bildungsroman, in actuality, it is a tale of far more, encompassing existentialism, the will to live and is concerned with inspiring change, shattering codes, boundaries and obtaining free will.<br />
<br />
There is a huge emphasis on codes and restrictions through the series. Beastinarians of Ake Village, including Soyon, are required by code to raise Touda with the silent whistle and benetrophic water. Additionally, Kiba’s must be taken care of extra carefully as they are a prized possession to the Grand Duke. However, Soyon breaks the Aohroh Code in two instances when she dissociates with the Aohroh by marrying into the village, and again by using the Renditioner’s skill to save Erin during Touda Trial. Soyon is consistently seen to be in deep thought, questioning her job and reaffirming whether she wants Erin to follow in her footsteps or not. She states that by taking care of the Touda with benetrophic water, they get stronger on the outside, but something weakens elsewhere. This “something” is connection, which is further emphasized throughout the series. She does not hesitate to blow the silent whistle in instances of danger, demonstrating that she truly understands the circumstances of her job, despite also stating that she dislikes using the whistle. Right before being taken to Touda Trial, Soyon tosses away her silent whistle. By tossing away the silent whistle, Soyon finally rejects the codes and pursues her own ideals. The aforementioned instance when she commits the crime, serves as an act of rebellion, solidifying her resolve.<br />
<br />
The series also uses nature to parallel the situations and events of individuals. On many occasions, flora and fauna are used metaphorically, such as in the case of when a cocoon lays in a tree and a bird waits to attack it, Erin herself portrayed as the cocoon, in turn, representing Erin’s vulnerability and sensitivity regarding the death of Soyon. In another case, two leaves diverge on a river’s surface and a tree which Shunan and Nugan had grown together, is chopped down, symbolizing the change in mindset of the two, deciding to take different paths. For Nugan, this is him breaking away from reliance on his brother, stating that he always thought his brother made the correct decisions. This change signifies that he can think for himself. Another example is when Jone sets up a new beehive and Erin watches the queen bee enter it, waiting and watching as the rest of the bees to follow her in. She then asks why the bees don’t simply escape. Jone replies by saying that the bees follow the queen. Jone teaches Erin that both the queen bee and worker bees were born the same, yet the queen is what determines everything. This reflects the way the citizens of the kingdom follow the Shin-Oh, almost blindly. Codes are shown to be broken with Psy-Gamul, considered traitors, who turn against the Shin-Oh and instead find the Grand Duke to be a more suitable ruler. This causes them to support a revolution.<br />
<br />
Nugan’s dependence on himself is shown in the instance he obeys Damiya in deploying a second Touda battalion in the final episode. He declares that he has thought through his decisions on his own and takes the opposite path of his brother, demonstrating his free will. On the other hand, Shunan represents “breaking free” when he turns against Seimiya and later joins with her, overwriting what it means to be the queen. The view of Seimiya’s line being a god, is shattered by the act of joining with Shunan, a normal human being. This, in turn shows signs of rebellion for both Shunan and Seimiya as they reject their sacred ancestry. The Shin-Oh herself, is revealed to be “blind” when she ventures outside the palace in order to visit the newborn Ohju in Kazalm. She is astonished by how beautiful the country is, revealing that she was largely unaware of outside matters. This is further exemplified when she remains unaware of the danger an Ohju presents and also by the fact of not knowing why the Ohju Canon’s were created as well as how her ancestors descended from Aphon Noa and history of Ophalon. Her character ties in with Seimiya and Tahya, portrayed as a bird trapped in a cage. The Shin-Oh and Seimiya were trapped within the palace, which served as a cage. Damiya sends a model of the palace to Seimiya as a present, revealing how he has her entangled. Damiya also appears to be the cause of the Shin-Oh’s obliviousness and in this way, he manages to entrap her as well. The Shin-Oh, in learning about the past as well as experiencing the outside world for the first time, to a degree, frees herself from her own ignorance. Damiya is also shown to break the codes, though necessarily in an optimistic sense, by constructing an elaborate scheme to take the throne. His approach is treasonous, breaking moral codes, as he calculates the attack on the Shin-Oh, one of his own kin, eventually leading to her death, as well as the hidden, aforementioned secondary Touda unit. He also breaks boundaries by attempting to engage with an incestuous relationship with Seimiya, incest being something usually out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Nukku and Mokku, despite usually being called out as annoying comedic relief characters throughout the series, actually show some minor development in episode 25, when they run an errand. They lose the money they were given and are forced into labor to try and earn it back. This is when they realize the value of “hard work.” Their backstory shows them constantly slacking off and running away from the task at hand, but a change is reflected when they commit to clearing out an entire field. Erin serves as a catalyst which allows Nukku and Mokku to break away from the old, lazy versions of themselves, inspiring them to work harder at Kazalm. Later on, after Erin receives her graduation diploma, it is revealed that the two have been promoted to full-time chore boys, in turn, further reflecting their growth. The change from passiveness to putting forward action is another key topic touched upon within the series, explained in a bit more detail later.<br />
<br />
Kirik himself is also portrayed in a similar way of being manipulated by Damiya, while believing that he is doing justice. His ideals lead to creating his own personal cage and he only realizes this after failing to finish off Ialu. Kirik shows development throughout the series as he questions whether he himself is the cage which binds Erin, when he poisons an incoming Ohju and reports details to Damiya in the palace. The flashback of Tahya is played repeatedly, emphasizing how obsessed he has become with “breaking free” and creating a society in which the “pure” can live. He later realizes that Erin is the most “pure” one as he sees her flying on Lilan, Tahya’s image reflecting from within her. He addresses the sincerity of her intentions, feeding into his eventual changing of sides. Ialu makes this clear and breaks his mask, representing Kirik “breaking free” from his role. He is later shown to trust Erin when he visits her upon being wounded. This is the instance which represents the aforementioned “changing of sides”, and he proceeds to assist Ialu in fighting off the newly employed Sezans.<br />
<br />
Aside from Soyon, there are two mentors who also assist in guiding Erin’s development through the series. Jone being the first, who takes after Erin and gradually acts as the foundation, expanding her view of the world. He is shown to be extremely passionate about teaching, to the degree of hiding a room of teaching material and deeply pondering whether he wants to tutor Erin or not. Honesty and dedication is shown through his backstory in which he was fired from being a teacher due to a student of his who attempts to commit suicide. This student abuses his parents’ authority to obtain test questions ahead of time, and Jone realizes this, causing him to swap his test before distribution. Jone realizes that if his students cheat they will only be lying to themselves, and in turn, will never be able to reach their full potential. Jone acts as a role model for Erin, while Erin re-ignites his passion for teaching. Jone is even seen as a father, as “father” is what Erin calls him at the end of episode 27, indicating the degree in which Jone has impacted her life. He is the key which helps Erin break out of her psychological trap, explained in more detail later on, allowing her to move on. This is further demonstrated after his death, in which Erin visits his secret base, thanks him for everything he has done, and commits to working the hardest she can. Esal, like Jone, acts as a mentor for Erin, and she is shown to be a respectable character, wanting only the best for her students, yet challenging them in various ways. She is what allows Kazalm to appear similar to a safe haven in Erin’s eyes. Upon admitting Erin, Esal instructs her students to disregard the fact that Erin is of the Aohroh, and this later contributes to Erin realizing that “it’s okay to be different.” Esal also tries not to treat Erin specially just because she has the responsibilities of taking care of Lilan, and expects her to still manage to keep up with the rest of her peers, confronting her when her grades begin to slip and allowing her to fully understand what comes with her job when she asks her to prepare a will. In this will, she tells Erin to acknowledge that it is her own stupidity which brought her to the grave, and this helps reinforce the reality of potential death. She also thinks several steps ahead, carefully considering the danger stemming from Erin’s disobedience of the Canons, yet still allows Erin to pursue her ideals. However, the relationship between Esal and Erin is not simply of teacher and student, but rather of teacher and teacher. There are many situations in which Esal is clueless of what to do, such as when Lilan refuses to eat despite all the methods she and Tomura attempt, and also when Lilan gives birth and she admits that she lacks the knowledge to do anything. Erin helps Esal realize that she had believed that humans and Ohju could not be connected, merely because there was no evidence of it; the only experiences the Ohju had with the teachers was being knocked out by the silent whistle, only to later find food mysteriously appear. Erin’s treatment of Lilan shatters her beliefs as she acts more like a mother figure, directly feeding and playing with Lilan. This causes Esal to work with her towards studying Ohju in a new light, exploring the idea of treating the Ohju more humanely. By episode 43, Esal also grows to deeply respect Erin’s character after Erin loses her fingers, yet still remains determined to set Lilan free.<br />
<br />
At Kazalm, we also have Erin’s fellow classmates who serve to assist and cheer her on during her struggles, as well as Tomura, who initially undertook care of Lilan. Upon meeting Erin for the first time, Tomura pays little attention to her, but quickly feels jealous once his role of taking care of Lilan is threatened. He believes that nobody can take better care of Lilan than he can and is stubborn in attempting to solve the problem of making her eat. Lilan had been injured prior to arriving to Kazalm and was nearly starving to death. She was afraid being in a new place and movement would cause her wounds to re-open. Tomura sticks to the conventional methods described in the Ohju Canons of blowing the Silent Whistle to knock out the Ohju before feeding them. As previously described, as a result of this, the Ohju had little actual interaction with humans and Lilan needed a sort of mother figure in order to eat. However, Erin shines light on different methods of care and connection, shattering Tomura’s perception that he is best fit to take care of Lilan, and similarly to Esal, calls upon the idea that humans can interact with Ohju. In the end, he fully yields Lilan’s care over to Erin and breaks free from his pride and stubbornness which would have otherwise killed Lilan if it had continued. He comes to accept defeat in this case and gradually grows to respect Erin, encouraging her as a fellow classmate.<br />
<br />
The series also transcends gender roles. It is implied that women in such society are typically married off at an early age, Erin and Jone visit town and someone states that 14 is an age suitable for marriage. The question of marriage is brought up again when Jone asks Erin at one point whether she wants to continue with him and be married off, or pursue her own path. Erin decided to reject the marriage resulting in her stay in Kazalm and her studying under Esal. She, and Esal, break the said gender roles by becoming instructors, and Shiron by fighting expectations enforced upon her. Shiron struggles with gender roles as her father states that women cannot become teachers. This causes her to study at Kazalm to prove a point by wanting to quickly take care of an Ohju. Her development sparks from learning genuineness and the will to live. She initially attempts to study by the book, but later discovers that there are things which one must experience to truly learn; Erin’s class takes place outdoors, in which her students are allowed to explore on their own, reflecting her character and beliefs that seeing something with one’s own’s eyes can be just as effective as conventional studying. Shiron remarks that the books state nothing about Ohjus giving birth, which brings up the contrast between “experiencing something” and “learning about an experience.” By the end of the episode, both Erin and Shiron’s characters are developed. Erin is shown through another lens, taking on the role of a teacher for the first time and her bravery is shown when she assists Lilan in giving birth as she gets continuously battered, yet gets up each and every time without fail. This causes Shiron to recognize that it is Erin’s resolve which made her into a teacher at Kazalm, not her grades. She is shown to adopt Erin’s way of thinking when she gives up her book and decides to see things with her own eyes.<br />
<br />
Ialu is shown to break codes when he refuses to follow the orders of his superiors, by making a fuss and failing to eliminate Nukku and Mokku. He fails to protect the queen on the ship and later leaves the Sezan code through marriage, as he states that the Sezan are not allowed to marry. Sezans are typically supposed to protect the queen until death, and at one point, the Shin-Oh ponders upon how much of Ialu’s life has been wasted protecting her. Later, he is dismissed from his role as Sezan and this can be seen as another act of “breaking free.” He is given the ability to pursue a life of his own for the first time instead of being chained down to the duty of protecting the royalty. Ialu also seems to experience change due to Erin. He acts coldly to mostly everyone around him, but holds a soft spot for Erin and gradually opens up over time, the two become comfortable enough to share secrets with one another, Erin with her past and Ialu with his. In another instance, when Erin attempts to explain the significance of the Ohju Canons, she calls in Ialu to the table-side, showing the connection they share. This gradual change in Ialu representing him, breaking away from his old self. Ialu is even shown to be accepted by Lilan in the instance when he is being pursued and Lilan is able to hide him beneath her.<br />
<br />
Erin herself stands as the greatest heroine I’ve seen in the entirety of anime. She shows an obvious curious side, but also a subtle “rebellious” side throughout the series as well when she sneaks into the Touda pits to search for the missing baby Touda against Soyon’s words. She also deliberately looks in the room which Jone bars off and stands up against Ialu when Nukku and Mokku are threatened. Like Soyon, she struggles a lot with codes. Upon arriving at Kazalm, she realizes that there are rules that she needs to obey, and spends time learning them; she is overly curious and spends too much time in the library, causing her to be late for meals and she asks too many questions in class, not realizing that she is not in a private tutor session and that there are other students trying to learn as well. She breaks the Ohju canons by raising Lilan without the silent whistle and instead employs her own methods of treating her like a wild beast. Her approach emphasizes connection, something which the Aohroh were working to prevent. The series demonstrates the importance of said connection, as the bond between Erin and Lilan is strengthened throughout the series. Kazalm itself, also breaks the code by refusing to report Erin to the palace and attempting to hide her when the Shin-Oh visits. For a long stretch of episodes, Erin also struggles to deal with Soyon’s death, the same scene being put on repeat and she appears to be stuck in a psychological trap. In episode 27 however, she seems to be liberated from the trap, with her newfound experiences with Jone as the way out, Erin resolves to living in the present rather than the past. She recognizes that she cannot change the past, but can change the future, which is further pondered upon towards the end of the series. Erin realizes that the beast and beastinarian experience both joys and sorrows TOGETHER. She is shown to break the codes again when she breaks her own moral code, by blowing the silent whistle and using it as a tool to control Lilan. The fact that Erin dislikes using the whistle and initially resolved to not blowing, and also that Lilan refuses to disobey those who blow the whistle, reflects the shared suffering between the two. However, Lilan also breaks her “codes” when she breaks away from her natural instinct. Upon attacking the Touda riders, Lilan initially succumbs to bloodlust and goes berserk, just as how the tragedy occurred. This serves as a reminder to Erin that Lilan is a wild beast as she had looked upon Lilan as if she would not purposefully harm anything; she remarks that “looking at them now, it’s like it never happened.” Prior to the attack on the ship, instances of danger Lilan presented were purely accidental, Lilan attacking Erin due to being pricked by the brush. After the attack, however, Erin is reminded of the danger which comes with her responsibilities, similarly to how she seems to develop a fear of Touda after experiencing Touda Trial. Early on in the show as well, Erin learns that Touda aren’t just cute wild animals. When she realizes that Lulu’s ear web must be cut off, she recognizes the degree in which humans manipulate the fates of such beasts, and in that, she sympathizes with them. Seeing Lilan overtaken with bloodlust creates a rift between Erin and Lilan and Erin finds it difficult to approach the cage for several days. The incident with the whistle further expands the crack in their relationship, causing Lilan to this time, show signs of rebellion, having an ill-attitude towards Erin’s commands up until the final episode. However, by the end of the series, signs are shown of their relationship being repaired. This is revealed when Lilan breaks free from her inner nature. In episode 50, upon being forcefully sent away with the silent whistle, Lilan does not succumb to bloodlust and is able to rescue Erin, rebuilding the trust the two thought they had lost.<br />
<br />
The series has a lot to say about relationships as a whole with the Canons and fear of the Ohju representing the social barriers restricting a person from forming relationships. These barriers lead to a lack of understanding, in turn, causing the country to divide and clash. There appears to be discrimination between “Wajyaku” and “Holon,” the discrimination itself showing how they are bound by barriers, preventing a deeper understanding between the two groups. The Aohroh wish not to repeat the tragedy, leading them into creating the Canons in the first place, barring relationships and representing how people shy away from such connection. They choose to “sacrifice” the connection in order to prevent the tragedy, instead of embracing the connection to create said understanding. Erin focuses on the latter option, breaking these said barriers by forming a relationship with Lilan, something never seen before and overwriting the “known” fact being that beasts will never befriend humans. The beasts themselves, confined, also embody how people are confined. Erin asks whether beasts were created for the sake of people, and it is only when humanity breaks free from this mentality in which relationships can be formed. Instead of approaching the Ohju with fear, she approaches them with care and compassion as shown when Erin attempts to demonstrate that she is an Akun Mei Chai with special powers. In this case, Erin knows that Ohju are sensitive to emotion as well as the fact that they have a circle of personal space and that they generally do not listen to those who blow the silent whistle. This understanding allows her to play her harp and remain safe as she approaches. The person following her, who demonstrates “a lack of understanding of Ohju,” violates personal space and is nearly killed as a result. In another instance, when Erin visits Seimiya as she is bathing, she assists in shattering the barriers once again, making her aware of her history and in a broader sense, acts as a kind of mediator which allows Seimiya to accept Shunan’s proposal. It is the destruction of such barriers which allows their joining, which symbolizes the “understanding” and “relationships” that people refrain from developing. By breaking down these barriers, Erin emphasizes taking the first steps in forming connection instead of shying away as this connection is essential for a greater understanding of one another.<br />
<br />
The will to live is also explored throughout the series. Soyon’s final words to Erin were to “live on and find happiness.” There words stuck with Erin and this causes her keep on living, no matter how harsh the circumstances become. Despite being in a seemingly hopeless situation after being impaled with in arrow in the final episode, in the middle of the battlefield, bleeding out while being chased by a gigantic hoard of Touda, Erin still retains the will to live on. The will to live is also shown with her encounter with Ialu. Erin convinces him that there are “still things he can protect with his hands” after tending to his injuries. In a second encounter with Erin, Ialu discovers the will to live he decides to keep on fighting until the end, while also telling Kyle that he plans to return alive. His duels with the new Sezan and Kirik demonstrate his strong resolve to keep going. Erin also seems to imbed the will to live in Kirik, when he turns to her for medical support and she tells him not to die. Kirik plans to commit suicide by taking on Ialu, but Ialu convinces him otherwise. He provides him with an escape route and against all odds, manages to survive and see the sunrise. He is later shown to have lived on as a medicine seller in the epilogue, helping to cure people rather than poisoning them, demonstrating his reformation.<br />
<br />
Another question brought up is “action vs. passiveness.” This is a contrast between the Aohroh and Erin as the Aohroh have already submit to merely “watching” things play out, while Erin seeks to make change through her own actions. Erin confronts Nason by explaining that he has already “submit,” meaning that the Aohroh have accepted things as they are, and have given up without even trying. Erin however, is shown to believe that effort can make a difference. She is shown in many instances, going against what is considered to be acceptable, in one case, even refusing to protect the queen (something considered to be betrayal) to preserve her own moral values. The series challenges and breaks free from the idea of a pre-determined future as it questions the “futility” of action. Early on, Erin recognizes the entire life cycle of the Touda. They are domesticated in villages with the silent whistle and benetrophic water. They are raised and trained, and then eventually sent into battle where they fight until death. She recognizes how futile the act is of attempting to make connection with such beasts as she knows they will be killed off eventually anyway. Similar questioning occurs when Erin realizes that Lilan will never be able to live in the wild and questions whether all her efforts are in vain. However, the concept of futility acts as another barrier within the series in which Erin breaks. She comes to a realization that even if putting forward effort may be rendered useless in the end, the act of NOT putting forward the effort is even worse and completely erases the possibility of change all together. She also decides that hope does exist, and, contrasting with the Aohroh, concludes to not give up on trying to make a change. Despite resolving to never using Ohju as tools of war, she “breaks” her own statement, resolving to make a change when she sends Lilan to save Shunan. This displays how she truly believes her actions can make a difference. Her mentality even touches upon life itself, as she “struggles to live in any way she can” throughout the series and is not concerned with what it all means. This demonstrates how she has transcended meaning itself, in other words, she does not even need meaning to live on. Even if there is no light at the end of tunnel and even if everything is worth nothing in the end, Erin tries her best to live the best life she can. This is one such series which has really hit me the way Texhnolyze has.<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin is a series about breaking codes, living and liberating oneself. One interesting aspect is how the show itself is transcendent of age. With its child-like storybook-esque presentation, the series can easily be assumed to be targeted towards a younger audience. However, it is a series which breaks conventional age restrictions by being applicable to everyone. It encompasses universal subjects in building relationships, yet still remains layered so that an older audience can appreciate it. The series places a large emphasis on challenging what one opposes. It says to stand against things which one believes deserves a change. Throughout the series, Erin is shown to display great care for the beasts she tends to, and disdains the idea of binding them by human codes. She then works towards changing society with efforts. Erin’s name, in the context of the show, means “mountain apple” and she symbolizes such in various instances, such as the opening and final scene as the show. Erin herself can be the “fruits of labor” as she calls to action herself, and those around her. Interestingly enough, Lilan’s name means, “light” and light is something which plants need to grow. Lilan allows Erin to break free from her childhood innocence, and illuminates the harsh realities of the world, causing her to conjure the determination to make a change. This series is powerful and inspirational, a flawed masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.<br />
<br />
 It is a series which has truly made its mark on me and one I will continue to analyze in the future. :)

    While it may strike as inconsistent to rate a series a 3 when I &quot;finished&quot; 50 episodes of it, there is one essential reason, that is pacing of this series. Not only is the pacing typically slice-of-life slow from the very start, but it has the most self-indulgent use of flashback I have ever seen. By the midpoint of the anime, flashback starts taking up easily perhaps 1/10th of the total time. We already saw these events, and they are already in our heads. Bringing the same events up as much as five or ten times is a horrible abuse of our viewership. Maybe it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23915">
        was for the kids, but it was a horrible mismanagement of structure.<br />
<br />
Also, this anime seems to exist in some bizarre world where, despite there being super skilled assassin type figures and two types of invincible beasts, poison ends up being the most worrisome agent of life. I think the plot spends as much time on poisonings by the end as it does touda.<br />
<br />
I did enjoy core elements of the plot, and that is the main reason I finished the anime. I liked the focus on Erin, and I could even forgive her being the typical &quot;supergenius, super caring&quot; character who can do absolutely no wrong because of the nice voice acting and the interesting progression of her life. I also liked the touda, though I liked them less once another super invincible creature was introduced. I felt that both touda and beast lords should have been introduced right away, or it should have only been one the whole way. I felt that after Erin&amp;Jone, the anime struggled to ever keep itself at quite the same depth of interaction after moving to focus on beast lords. It especially struggles to make any action feel slightly convincing, and several conversations as it goes on become more and more incredibly tedious, e.g. Erin talking to either queen.<br />
<br />
This is absolutely a children&#039;s anime, and I do not see why everyone is trying to vehemently deny it. The first OP and ED, the narration (utterly childish storytelling tone, constantly interferes with the quality of interaction with the story), and interaction between characters (Erin and her mom, the Queen and anybody, Erin and Yuuyan, any and all explanations about anything ever from one character to another) all make sure that this cannot progress above being childish. People can try to use the more violent moments to write it away, but the art contradicts that. Also childish are all depictions of Erin imagining anything horrible happening (the last example episode 44, 19:30 or so in, when she pictures what is happening at the academy).<br />
<br />
The music is very nice sounding, especially when you have only heard each song once (with the exception of the song that inscrutably rips off one progression from Trigun). Unfortunately, they ram the same songs into your ears relentlessly, and eventually at very wrong moments. <br />
<br />
Not much really needs to be said about the art, since the flaws are much more glaring than usual. Sometimes the mistakes are much more glaring (like when the touda are swimming underwater episode 7 and llook like barrel of monkey figures). Also, lots of shots that are the same shot being panned very slowly, or zoomed out from very slowly. Kid Erin is a bit annoying to look a thanks to her eyes (not that any character&#039;s wayward pupils are any fun to look at). The Beast-Lords, paraded as a paragon of beauty, are actually ugly beasts in motion, and simplistic when &quot;shining&quot; and flying to save the day.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really have to rate this anime a waste of anyone&#039;s time. It loses what depth it has as it goes on, it struggles to balance the time and how the time is spent on any action, and everything is far too predictable. It is enjoyable enough, and there are plenty of cute moments, but it cannot be said to be worth anyone&#039;s time due to the length - it should have absolutely been a normal anime season, not 50 episodes.<br />
<br />
Oh, like a lot anime and manga that lack substance, this series spends a lot of time making up for it pretending that characters going &quot;oishiiiiiii&quot; and talking about food should actually be entertaining. Like always, it definitely is not appropriate outside an anime or manga about food. I did not keep any official count, but surely somewhere around ten times.

    I&#039;m going to draw a middle line on the debate surrounding the &#039;childrens anime&#039; tag and just suggest that this is &#039;all ages.&#039; Much of the scenic artwork found in Kemono no Souja Erin is deeply reminiscent of Folk Tale art, and I would go so far as to say that the show follows such a line in terms of story as well. This isn&#039;t to say that its in any way juvenile, it isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
The depth to this anime is truly exceptional, to the point where I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever seen its like. The plot builds slowly, and meticulously. Each new episode lays down

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16355">
        new stones, each building on the last, constructing the world with considerable attention to detail.<br />
<br />
This story could quite probably have been told in 26 or even 13 episodes, thats the feeling I&#039;m getting as it progresses (this being written with 17 episodes out so far). However the story hasn&#039;t been drawn out so much as each character and element of the world has been allowed to grow organically over time.<br />
<br />
This is an epic tale with epic presentation, with an artistic style I can&#039;t really attach to anything else I&#039;ve ever seen.  I can only imagine that once this series is done it will take on a life of its own; but, even now as its running I can think of no other anime I was ever less likely to stall or drop.<br />
<br />
This is as close, I think, as an anime can get to a truly good book. A must watch.

    Yep...the time has come. I&#039;ve been gradually watching this series for about 3 months and now it&#039;s finally time to give my thoughts on it. This isn&#039;t going to be easy. On the one hand, I really love this series. I added it to my extended favorites without hesitation. The first 20 episodes are absolutely amazing! It&#039;s still the best anime adaptation of a YA novel that I&#039;ve seen. I think it&#039;s quite a bit better than Moribito or Shinsekai Yori.<br />
<br />
However, Erin also has some issues. From roughly episodes 20-40, the anime just pulls the drag chute and becomes unbearably slow. The 2 god awful

          <span style="display: none;" id="review343159">
        comic relief characters get a full episode. We get I believe 3 flashback episodes. There&#039;s a mini arc where this girl comes to Erin&#039;s school and is jealous of her, which feels like the most pointless of filler. It doesn&#039;t flesh out the world or tell us anything new about Erin&#039;s character. Most of these episodes just waste our precious time and accomplish little else. Then the final 10 episodes are a mad dash to finish the plot and it isn&#039;t nearly as satisfying as it should be. With 50 episodes, none of the character arcs should feel rushed or unearned, but that&#039;s exactly what happens to poor Ialu. The ending is just kind of...meh. <br />
<br />
Imagine a soccer team going up 5-0 in the first half, then they barely win the game because they scored 3 own goals in the 2nd half. That&#039;s basically what it feels like to watch Erin. It&#039;s positively maddening at points! Here&#039;s an anime example. My generation grew up loving DBZ, which is divided into 4 arcs: Saiyan, Namek, Cell, and Buu. If you ask ANYONE what the worst arc is, they&#039;ll say the Buu arc. We all know the Buu arc is kind of shit. Toriyama will admit the Buu arc was kind of shit. He had stopped wanting to write the series and was basically writing random nonsense to get the manga cancelled early. Despite all of that, some of the most beloved moments in the franchise are from the Buu arc! Vegeta&#039;s big sacrifice. Mr. Satan&#039;s unlikely friendship with Fat Buu. The fusion dance. Super Saiyan 3. Krillin and 18 being the most wholesome couple in the franchise. ALL of that was Buu arc. Let&#039;s get back to Erin. How many of my top 10 moments came from the last 30 episodes? I would honestly say 1. Maybe 2 being generous. The last 3/5ths of Erin are WAY worse relative to the first part than the Buu arc is worse than the rest of DBZ.<br />
<br />
Erin takes place in a fantasy kingdom where the borders are constantly being defended by knights who ride giant lizards. Basically flightless dragons. These soldiers live extremely hard lives, but the people in the capital city are oblivious to their sacrifices and look down on them. Sort of like the Night&#039;s Watch. Or more accurately how conservatives think urban liberals look down on, spit on, and fail to appreciate the US military. Erin is born in a village whose entire existence is to breed dragons and prepare them for war. Despite this, Erin is a cheerful and kindhearted child. Erin&#039;s mother Soyon is a dragon veterinarian and loves Erin dearly, but Soyon ends up having to make a decision that she knows will cost her own life. Soyon calmly accepts her fate and decides to spend 1 last peaceful day with her daughter before her execution orders come in. This episode is so touching and beautiful that the anime is in solid 9/10 territory. Erin tries to stop the execution, but fails. She drifts downriver and ends up being adopted by a kindly old teacher named Jone. The episodes that show Erin gradually bonding with Jone are also incredibly heartwarming and awesome. Then Erin goes off to vet school to care for these legendary pokemon called Beast Lords and this is where things go downhill. I&#039;m not going to summarize the entire series, but trust me on this one.<br />
<br />
Erin is the main heroine and BY FAR the most loved character in the show. At first, I thought she was the sweetest little girl in existence. How could you NOT love Erin? She&#039;s the nicest person ever. She&#039;s the greatest genius her kingdom has seen in 100 years. She&#039;s absolutely fearless. She&#039;s a moral paragon like Superman, representing all that&#039;s good and right. She&#039;s a musical prodigy who can instantly play the harp at an expert level on her first try. She&#039;s the first to tame a legendary pokemon and fly around on it in over 1,000 years. She performs a human surgery with zero practice because she read it in a book once and she&#039;s Erin god damn it! If I was being generous, I&#039;d describe Erin as a Christ figure. If I wasn&#039;t in a great mood, I&#039;d say she&#039;s one of the worst Mary Sues I&#039;ve ever seen in anime! I&#039;m not saying this because she&#039;s female. I have no sexist intent here. The original novel is aimed at 12 year old girls and I know it was written to create a flawless role model. It&#039;s silly for a 32 year old guy to call this character boring, because I&#039;m NOT the target audience. I don&#039;t want to rain on little girls&#039; parade just to be a dick! However, Erin has gained this weird reputation as an elite anime, and I mean ELITE. As in your first time listening to Wagner&#039;s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg elite. As in it&#039;s so transcendentally rich that you get carried away and feel you&#039;re superior to your fellow man just for liking it. THAT level of monocle sporting elite. With a reputation like that, I would expect a protagonist that at some point has a moral struggle or makes a single wrong decision. <br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s Erin&#039;s love interest Ialu. This fucking guy. He starts out as this cold, badass killing machine who says he has no right to shed tears or have emotions because his hands are just SO stained with innocent blood! For most of the series, this guy is like a cross between Edwin Cullen of Twilight and Heero Yuy of Gundam Wing. You can really tell this was written for tween girls. In fact, I wouldn&#039;t even say he&#039;s as well written as Heero Yuy! At least with Heero we see his first time accidentally killing civilians and his descent into a heartless soldier of death. We don&#039;t really spend any time with Ialu. We&#039;re always told and never shown. Of course, when he sees little miss perfect Erin, his icy heart just INSTANTLY melts for her. Also he&#039;s around 20 and she&#039;s 8 when they first meet. It&#039;s that sweet innocent girl x bad boy couple that was very dominant after Phantom of the Opera and Disney&#039;s Beauty and the Beast. After the time skip, Ialu has shifted from a very grey character to a pure good guy. He has ONE line about how he doesn&#039;t deserve happiness after all the atrocities he&#039;s apparently committed, but Erin says &quot;Nah, you&#039;re a good dude&quot; and that&#039;s it. That&#039;s his redemption arc. Erin, you had 50 episodes. FIFTY. DAMN. EPISODES. This isn&#039;t easily excusable for me. I swear to God my Elfen Lied fanfiction did a better job on this topic. As in I actually spent WAY more time and effort on Lucy&#039;s redemption than the writer/director of Erin did on Ialu&#039;s redemption. I&#039;m not a professional writer, nor a good writer by any stretch of the imagination. When I can look at a sub-plot and think, &quot;yeah I could write something better in 30 minutes&quot; it&#039;s a problem.  <br />
<br />
So where does that leave us overall? It&#039;s very hard to say. Part of me loves Erin and wants to cheer it on to become the highest rated YA novel anime on MAL. I will still defend Erin over Shinsekai any day. I&#039;ll gladly die on that hill. At the same time, I feel frustrated that Erin&#039;s flaws and the sheer extent of these flaws aren&#039;t brought up as often as they should be. These aren&#039;t just minor nitpicks. In Galactic Heroes when a fleet is caught in a pincer formation and you snarkily think, &quot;Why can&#039;t they just go up and down? They&#039;re in outer space!&quot; That&#039;s a nitpick. That&#039;s being Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. Erin&#039;s flaws are sizeable. It makes me wonder if people actually finished this series or just watched the first 20 episodes and put complete on their MAL profiles. Having said all of that, I WOULD still recommend Erin. It&#039;s a very good anime. It&#039;s just that for me it didn&#039;t quite live up to its reputation. <br />

    Nahoko Uehashi’s Kemono no Souja Erin is a “hidden gem” anime. While more people have seen/heard of Uehashi’s Seirei no Moribito, not nearly enough people have seen this beautiful series. I could babble about how much I love this series for hours, but, instead, I’ll try to tell you why (and why it’s 9/10 instead of 10/10!).<br />
<br />
This review is spoiler free! :D<br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
While it’s story made for children, Kemono no Souja Erin addresses adult topics at a mature level. The target audiences’ age is somewhat irrelevant, because the characters bloom, especially Erin. She’s a child character the viewer can admire and adore. Following her journey

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194490">
        through childhood and into her teenage years, she comes to life as one of the most well developed characters I’ve come across.<br />
<br />
But her light does not darken the supporting cast. Each character presents a unique personality ranging from quirky to noble. The show masterfully explores the inner conflicts of good, bad, and neutral characters. <br />
<br />
Better yet, most characters have significant relationships with more than just Erin. Erin serves as the story’s heart, but each relationship adds another dimension to the story. <br />
<br />
Erin, though, does form many relationships, most of which I find touching, healthy, and beautiful. Each person Erin knows shapes her life and identity, guiding her and creating a strong, passionate woman and one of the best female protagonists of anime.<br />
<br />
The cast is flawed but well explained. It’s easy to fall in love with at least half of them, and you’ll understand their motivations. The series also presents different point of views. While it usually favors Erin’s, other people are not condemned for their individual beliefs. <br />
<br />
There is a catch.<br />
<br />
This anime was made with children in mind. In light of the dark concepts this story touches on, the anime added two characters not included in the original novel. Unfortunately, these characters simply distract you from the story. They, unlike the others, receive little to no development and serve mainly as comic relief. To me, they degraded the show a bit, which is why the characters are 9/10 instead of 10/10. <br />
<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
<br />
The journey starts slow and gradually grows into an epic battle between countries. The first episodes seem very slice of life, but, in truth, Kemono no Souja Erin is a story about Erin’s life. Erin is like a fly with a spider web being woven around her. She becomes central to the conflict that builds during the show’s many episodes. However, she remains unaware of this and follows her own path without realizing where it’s leading her. Masterfully interwoven into her story are characters that move the central plot forward.  <br />
<br />
The show advocates protecting nature and bonding with animals without condemning humans or those who use animals. It presents each point of view fairly and shows that life isn’t always black and white, that what’s “right” is not always feasible. <br />
<br />
Again, however, the anime has a knick that the original story didn’t include: two clip-show episodes and dozens of flashbacks. There is even one critical scene that is often shown two or three times in an episode. The series political labyrinth coupled with young age of its intended audience, it recaps plot points constantly. Without all of these flashbacks, the show could have been 5 or so episodes shorter. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the show focuses more on characters than plot, showing how their personal experiences, beliefs, and choices move the plot forward. With characters as fascinating and complex as Ial, as conflicted and passionate as Shunan, and as wise and sweet as Shinou, letting the characters lead the story was a wise decision. Instead of having plot throw and toss them around like a ship at sea, these characters’ well-developed and explained actions guide the plot. <br />
<br />
Art (and cinematography in general): 10/10<br />
<br />
Drawn in a unique style I find reminiscent of Native American art, the anime feels like a work of art. That alone makes it worth watching at least once. The style is flat and geometric with bold, bright colors that help bring the story to life. <br />
<br />
However, the symbolism in the art is blatant—remember, kids are supposed to understand it.  <br />
<br />
(music)<br />
<br />
A weak point of the show, the music leaves much to be desired. While most of the songs are fine, the action songs distract the viewer more than anything else. It threw me out of the story once in a while, but Kemono no Souja Erin had the power to quickly pull me back in.<br />
<br />
(angles)<br />
<br />
Clever, very clever. This show uses its unique art style to help express emotion, dramatize scenes, and avoid more graphic content. <br />
<br />
(intro/outro)<br />
<br />
This show has two intros, though both use the same song sung by different artists. I enjoy both the intros and believe they do a good job of capturing the heart of the show. The first outro is clever and cute, but the second is more a string of pictures than anything too creative.<br />
<br />
Female Representation: 10/10<br />
<br />
This comes as no surprise. Erin is amazing, and she is not the only female. All the women have their own strength. We see them in positions of power while others are powerless. They are allowed to stand on opposite sides and are just as interesting as the boys. No one is sexualized either. And, thankfully, the men are not thrown to the wolves to make the females interesting. The entire cast is very well done.<br />
<br />
Sub vs Dub:<br />
<br />
The show has not been dubbed, but the sub is filled with emotion and well done.<br />
<br />
Warnings: <br />
<br />
The flashbacks will likely irritate you after a while, and you can skip the clip-show episodes. There is one bizarre scene with singing  . . . It’s supposed to be cute, but it felt out of place to me. Despite being for kids, this show has moments of gore and violence. It also deals heavily with death, so just keep that in mind. Also, the two added characters are extremely bothersome. Just ignore them and don’t let it take away from this beautiful tale. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
Without the excessive flashbacks and additional cast members, this show is an easy 10/10. I fully believe if this show wasn&#039;t labeled a &quot;kids anime&quot; more people would&#039;ve have seen it. There is a very good reason why this show is ranked #110. It is heartwarming yet heart-wrenching tale, a story for all ages. <br />

    Kemono no souja erin is about a girl thrust between two warring nations; she seems to be able to control beasts.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m giong to keep this extremely short until i watch mroe, then i&#039;ll edit.<br />
<br />
Kemono no souja erin is NOT a childrens book anime from what the other reviewer said. If one thinks of prejudice, death, politics, wars and folklore as a anime for children, you have downs. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll just note that the animation style may not suit everyone as it isn&#039;t what anime norms are today; with having said that, the characters look great, and the buildings although different have a certain charm, a charm

          <span style="display: none;" id="review14296">
        that i find more attractive, ever play valkyria chronicles? it reminds me of that kind of animation. <br />
<br />
the music is very befitting of the background and only adds to it.<br />
<br />
Voice actors are pretty good.<br />
<br />
Even though I cannot divulge more information at the time, i recommend giving this show a try, and i&#039;m sure it will get much deeper as it is a 50 episode anime.<br />
<br />
Sure if you wanna be judgemental and not give it a try be my guest, but on the same note, one might say that the writer of seirei no moribito wrote this story as well, and with that, i take my leave.

    &quot;Kemono no Souja Erin&quot; is an anime with great plot potential, well build characters and pleasant design, but unfortunately - horrid storytelling and structure. It takes 50 episodes to tell the story (which is supposed to be understandable, since it&#039;s long one), but dragged scenes with badly animated conversations, and lots of flashbacks make you feel as if it should be done in 26 episodes instead - and maybe it should have. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned, the story has great potential - we have our main heroine that we meet when she is still a little kid, we watch her grow, mature, and struggle, through all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26847">
        the hardships she has to overcome. In the same time the story gives us insight about what is going on in the country where the heroine lives, introduces us to the royal family, and some political intrigues. The characters presented have different backgrounds and aims but all of their stories intersect at some point. This is what you normally call &quot;great storytelling&quot;, but the thing is - the anime is horribly slow and not well planned. It could have been so much better.<br />
<br />
Many people claim that slow plot development of &quot;Kemono no Souja Erin&quot; simply builds up the atmosphere, and in some episodes - maybe they are right. But in most of them - no sir. Many episodes in this anime show action that could be presented in 10 minutes but goes on for 20. And yes, some very good series do this and are still great, but this anime it&#039;s not the case, because the means through which the creators prolong the episodes are mainly flashbacks, still shots of scenery and conversations presented to you in few still shots of people sitting next to each other. In other words - this is a prime example of poor directing and lack of money for animation. In some episodes you will see the same scenery scene even 6 times (I counted), and the flashbacks that remind you what happened few minutes ago. And why would somebody do that? Of course, not to animate anything else. This does not count anymore as &quot;building up the atmosphere&quot;. It really, really doesn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know what happened during the production of &quot;Kemono no Souja Erin&quot;, but something must have gone wrong. The way it is done really makes you feel as if it should take 26 episodes and nothing would be lost- it shouldn&#039;t be that way because the story is really good and complex. It is simply a shame that it went the way it did - it could have been a real anime gem, but it&#039;s not. You get bored, you see the same scenes you saw few minutes ago, you look at the endless still shots of scenery, and you don&#039;t get enough satisfaction. The poor directing and planning turned this story into and average show. I can only guess the novel is amazing. &quot;Seirei no Moribito&quot; by the same author, came out to be a MUCH better anime. Check it out instead. <br />

    Kemono no Souja Erin is a good choice for you if you want to watch a series aimed for children that tries to build a fantasy world that has its own depth and use that to ingrain something into your moral fiber. However this immediately becomes a terrible choice if you can&#039;t handle its slow pace and its very poor choices in the sound department, which I&#039;ll get on later. And it&#039;s also an obviously terrible choice if you don&#039;t expect it to treat you like a dumb kid who needs flashbacks every few episodes to be remembered what happens and don&#039;t like being to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review229615">
        be expected to sing along the songs just because there are lyrics on screen.<br />
<br />
Let me get out of the way the things the series does right before I start complaining. The most impressive aspect I found in the series is the world building. Which is one of the most important aspects in a fantasy series, as these type of settings try to present a different world, a world that has its own complexity and hierarchy. Erin especially succeeds in this aspect, as it manages to present a world with a functional government and detailing it rather well, presenting its inner conflicts and how it came about to be that way, presenting you its rules and what they&#039;re there for to prevent. And not only that, but it presented the misconceptions its people had about their own world, and how that influenced them later on. I didn&#039;t expect to come around to liking the world building of a series aimed for children, but I respected it and enjoyed finding out more about it. To give you some details about it, the default state described for the world, is that it&#039;s a country laid upon two layers. The queen&#039;s sector, which is the peaceful and residential part of the country, where everyone lives peacefully and they detest war and hail their queen as a blessing of the gods that holds everything peaceful. And the outer sector, the sector led by the Duke, who protects the sector of the queen from neighboring countries attacking the country, in order to maintain the inner peace of its sector. This created a tear in the country however, as the sector of the Duke despises the sector of the queen for being blind from the realities of war and the constant comfort they&#039;re showered with, while the Queen&#039;s sector hates them because they see them as brutes and barbarians who are disgusting for fighting wars and not leaving a peaceful life, despite they&#039;re in direct benefit from that.<br />
<br />
However, while I want to continue praising the series since there&#039;s some more positives to be said, a little disclaimer about the world building. The slow pace of the series and the constant flashbacks, will leave little individual thought and will make you figure out exactly how things will progress. The story is told in such a way that you can&#039;t miss any element and it will spoon feed itself after mashing itself into a bowl, so that any babyman without teeth can eat it. I&#039;ll go more in depth about these problems later.<br />
<br />
The other thing that has mostly admiration from me is the abundance of themes the series explores. It manages to explore themes of racism, prejudice, segregation, sexism, cruelty to animals, tragedy of war, basic human morality, the fact that pure intentions don&#039;t always lead to good results and other such things. It has a broad area in the things it has to say, and it&#039;s a good thing, considering how long it is. <br />
<br />
And it usually nails most of themes too, it just takes too much time getting there. The overabundance of flashbacks and oversimplification for babymen might kill some of their effectiveness tho.<br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s time to get the flashback talk out of the way. As the series progresses, the series makes it a point to cram in as many flashbacks as possible, to the point I think one particular one I&#039;ve seen at least 10-15 times after it happened. Possibly more. There&#039;s a lot of key events that are repeated to make sure that you get it, for the kids, to the point that you will get really tired after a while. To add to this, the series takes its time getting where it plans to go, spending a lot of unnecesary time on little things that just don&#039;t matter and are just wasting everyone&#039;s time. The time spent is spent randomly on children singing, or people singing, or repeatedly showing the scenery and background with the narrator spending way too much time reviewing the things that happen or talking about things that happened only a little while ago. With all of these things taken away, this anime could get considerably shorter, especially if you take away the two recap episodes presented when the timeskip appeared.<br />
<br />
As I&#039;ve said, this series seemed to have been designed to be child friendly, and I&#039;ve also mentioned the broad array of themes it explored, some of which mature. In truth, it isn&#039;t a purely child friendly series, as it features onscreen deaths, violence, maiming, and other such things, albeit censored, they still happen. So I&#039;ve decided to make a thing, starting with mild child friendly things, then progressing to the more savage stuff. There it is:<br />
<br />
• Songs played throughout each episode with lyrics on screen for the kids to sing.<br />
<br />
• There&#039;s a child protagonist with no flaws, for the kids, so they will have the right morals instilled in them, and her life is explored as she becomes an adult.<br />
<br />
• A constant showering of flashbacks, for the kids, as they need to remember the essential parts of the story and they won&#039;t be bothered by them.<br />
<br />
• Two hilarious characters with the type of slapstick humor that appeals to all ages. Their first gag is eating ass. For the kids.<br />
<br />
• Animals giving birth, like a baby goat coming out of a stretched out goatvagina, or a dragonreptile beast shitting out eggs out of their gaping anus, with extra detail on how flappy the anus is while shitting out the eggs. The shot after that, or before that, I don&#039;t remember, pans to a kid stunned with amazement and wonder. For the kids.<br />
<br />
• There&#039;s an episode dedicated to two gigantic birds in heat and them having birdsex, which was declared by the characters as the most beautiful thing they&#039;ve ever seen. The full scene has been uploaded to www.sexybigbirdslayinganegg.com. (I hope that doesn&#039;t exist. Follow your dreams, kids.)<br />
<br />
• Death of fictional animals with occasional blood displayed on screen with censored depictions of torn to shreds animals. For the kids.<br />
<br />
• Depictions of non-explicit maiming and characters being eaten alive, and other lightweight deaths, such as poison and offscreen and censored depictions through a less realistic artstyle. One of these tragedies happens while the japanese equivalent of buttrock plays on screen. Lyrics included. So the kids can sing. for the kids???<br />
<br />
• Incestuous marriage proposals. It&#039;s okay because mommy and daddy died when I was little. The fact that they&#039;re into it and the show is aimed for the kids might be the most redflag-ish thing in this.<br />
<br />
So earlier I&#039;ve mentioned recap episodes scattered when timeskips happen. So the show follows the story of Erin, as she grows from a child into a young adult. The most prevalent elements of her character is that she&#039;s a perfect innocent girl who aspires to learn and things animal cruelty is cruel and that everyone should stop it. Call PETA. Through Erin we learn of the world around her and the beasts she takes care of. We explore that animals can be dangerous, that it&#039;s tragic to shackle them, that they can be tools of war and other such things. Erin&#039;s not a really interesting character, as she has consistent personality traits and has only one goal in the story and that is to MAKE THE AMINALS BE FREE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! So if you expect the timeskip to change anything about her character, it doesn&#039;t. That&#039;s why I have nothing really to say about it. All it does is advance time when there&#039;s nothing happening in her life. All she is, is a great tool to explore the world, she undergoes no changes and there&#039;s no arc through which she goes through, but she is involved in everything because she&#039;s the main character. The only development she goes through is that she grows in height. Well actually... the closest thing to development for is a conclusion about beasts that the series is trying to lead us to but, Erin doesn&#039;t feel like she completely got there and is trying her best not to get there. What is interesting is how the world and the fictional animals, the touda and the beastlords, work, which are presented through Erin. They&#039;re part of the intrigue of the series, so I won&#039;t go into any detai about theml, since the series is a constant learning session about these beasts, until it isn&#039;t because the overarching plot kicks in.<br />
<br />
The overarching plot is interesting for the target audience chosen. It&#039;s the conflict between two sides of the same country, which act as crucial for each other. I can&#039;t detail much about how things go down beyond what I already said, but it&#039;s theme is that of equality between the citizens of a nation, and not just the royalty.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there&#039;s not much more to be said about the series except the god awful sound design but that&#039;s in a league of its own. The characters of the series are intriguing and bring some interesting facet or theme to it to explore. The only thing that might get annoying about them is when they keep showering us with flashbacks to understand that THAT&#039;S WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT CHARACTER! THAT&#039;S WHY THEY ARE THERE! THAT&#039;S IT! DID YOU FORGET? WE&#039;LL REMIND YOU! EVERY GODDAMN FUCKING TIME THEY&#039;RE ON THE SCREEN! What&#039;s also left to talk about is the animation, which has a simplistic style. Honestly, there&#039;s not really much to say here. I noticed that the characters lack pupils so I think that&#039;s what gave them a distinct feeling. I also enjoyed the switch in style whenever they needed to censor an onscreen event with a style reminiscent of cave painting spores and the style used for the background shots, which seems to be painted rather than handdrawn.<br />
<br />
NOW OK, LISTEN UP, LISTEN UP! Not only does this series have only a few songs, it has songs that you have to sing along because they put the lyrics on screen. Well, you don&#039;t have to, but the series aspires for you to be doing that. And it happens every episode. Does that sound bad? The highest point of the series for me was one of the worst possible moments to be doing that in the series. There&#039;s this character that gets eaten by wild animals, a moment that is supposed to be dramatic, right. Guess what happens? Yes, a song plays. It plays a song, with lyrics on the screen for you to sing. And the best way to paint an imagine for you without giving any information on what actually happens is this. Imagine there&#039;s a kid wearing a Sonic the Hedgehog T-Shirt walking on the street and all of a sudden dogs bite him. As soon as they start chewing and eating him, Escape from the City from Sonic Adventure 2 plays. And if you&#039;re curious what that is, I&#039;ll put the lyrics for that song at the end of this review, as well as what to type into youtube to play the song.<br />
<br />
To sum up what I said, Kemono no Souja Erin is a series aimed at kids that aims for mature themes, but it gets drowned out by its slow pace, its constant showers of flashbacks and the fact that it once again, aims it at kids. It has impressive world building but if you can&#039;t handle the problems mentioned earlier, especially a slow pace, you should avoid this. The show might be worth it for the world building and its well written fantasy setting, but other than that, I don&#039;t advice anyone on watching it. This show could&#039;ve been pretty good if most of the essential parts of the story were shown rather than it being so obviously dragged out and dumbed down. I could see this being really enjoyable if it was aimed in a different direction, as the fundation was very solid. I hope I&#039;ve given you all the information you&#039;ve needed. This is the end of the review, but!<br />
<br />
If you wanna get the full review experience, type this into youtube: Escape From The City by Ted Poley and Tony Harnell (City Escape Theme) and I&#039;ll give you the lyrics to this song so you can sing along. It&#039;s what Kemono no Souja Erin would&#039;ve wanted, whether or not you wanted to or not, and that&#039;s how I often felt while watching it:<br />
<br />
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br />
<br />
OH YEAH!<br />
<br />
Rolling around at the speed of sound,<br />
Got places to go, gotta follow my rainbow.<br />
Can&#039;t stick around, have to keep moving on,<br />
Guess what lies ahead? Only one way to find out!<br />
Must keep on moving ahead,<br />
No time for guessing, follow my plan instead.<br />
Trusting in what you can&#039;t see,<br />
Take my lead, I&#039;ll set you free.<br />
<br />
Follow me, set me free,<br />
Trust me and we will escape from the city.<br />
I&#039;ll make it through, follow me.<br />
Follow me, set me free,<br />
Trust me and we will escape from the city.<br />
I&#039;ll make it through, prove it to you.<br />
<br />
Follow me!<br />
Oh yeah!<br />
<br />
Danger is lurking around every turn,<br />
Trust your feelings, got to live and learn.<br />
I know with some luck that I&#039;ll make it through,<br />
Got no other options, only one thing to do!<br />
I don&#039;t care what lies ahead,<br />
No time for guessing, follow my plan instead.<br />
Find that next stage, no matter what that may be.<br />
Take my lead, I&#039;ll set you free.<br />
<br />
Follow me!<br />
Follow me!<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll make it through, oh yeah!<br />
<br />
i&#039;m fucking sorry, okay?

    The first word that comes to mind after watching Kemono no Souja Erin is LIFE.  It is a story of a young girl growing up and finding her own pathway, as her mother asked her to do, to live and find happiness.  It has a series of ups, downs and everywhere in between.<br />
<br />
I was introduced to this anime after watching How to Train Your Dragon.  The concept intrigued me, but I was hesitant because it looked more like a children&#039;s anime.  I was completely wrong.  While a child would enjoy this show, it has deeper meanings and ideas.<br />
<br />
Story: The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review36116">
        in itself if amazing.  As the anime progresses and Erin gets older, the story gets more and more complex.  It takes its time to explain details and feelings Erin has for her friends and animals she cares for.  At times, it can feel slow, but it can also be very soothing during these times.  I also recognized the relationship to Japan&#039;s history: the late Heian period.  Politics in the capital and war out in the countryside and what would have happened if they tried to sort out their differences.<br />
<br />
Art: For the most part, I enjoyed the art and style of the anime.  Occasionally, I would get a little annoyed when they would replay the same clips over and over.  Also, it would get distracting with the switch to cartoon violence.  But other than that, it was simple and well done.<br />
<br />
Sound: I really enjoyed the OP and ED songs, especially the first ED.  It was a fun, hopeful, and easily gets stuck in your head type of song.  Music was a big part of the anime, especially the lyre.  The music was well written and it could be very moving at times.<br />
<br />
Character: The anime really focused on the relationship between characters, especially with Erin.  One of the most heartwarming relationships is between Erin and her mother.  It made me feel like if I ever had a daughter, I would want her to be like Erin.  For every person Erin encounters, she leaves a deep impact on their lives.  Erin is a genius; also, she is incredibly humble and stubborn at the same time.  There is a contrast between Erin and Kirik; while had difficult histories and received similar council, Erin chose to move forward, while Kirik sought the path of revenge.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  While I didn&#039;t enjoy every episode, it was a fun ride.  It always left me feeling that I want to know what will happen next.  Also, as a mentioned before, it can be very relaxing to see Erin live from day to day, learning.<br />

    Fantasy anime have long been characterized by an abundance of wicked sorcerers and cute cat girls, but Kemono no Souja Erin features none of these tropes, instead drawing on elements from classic fairy tales. Its innocuous artstyle, which mimics the illustrations of Aesop’s picture books, exhibits an aura foreign to most contemporary anime fans. Coupled with its unremarkable first episode, the show is easy to dismiss as a childish folktale not worth the trouble.<br />
 <br />
This is a gross misconception. What begins as an everyday tale about a naive young girl and her mother gradually evolves into a profound saga of morality, politics, and self-discovery.<br />
 <br />
For

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248375">
        all its deceivingly harmless visuals, Kemono no Souja Erin hides one of the most well-presented and mature stories. People die, political intrigues take place, and an innocent girl is thrust into a harsh world beyond her understanding. These are only superficial elements, however, since what makes the show truly mature is its ability to explore trivial matters in a serious and realistic way. Perhaps Erin’s curiosity about her mother&#039;s career as a “touda” breeder might not pique everyone’s interest, but I was every bit as engrossed as our heroine in learning the process of raising these strange lizard creatures. Even when most of the show revolves around Erin learning seemingly mundane things like taking care of beehives or studying medicine, I never once grew tired of watching the show.<br />
 <br />
Why is that? Probably because of the rich dialogue prevalent throughout its episodes.<br />
 <br />
The nice soundtrack and pleasant visuals did wonders in enriching the story, but most of the credit goes to the compelling dialogue. The show does not waste time meandering with pointless conversations; every time someone talks, I learn more about their character. Erin’s inquiries are particularly interesting; not even the most insignificant unknown escapes her notice. Whether it’s about a strange plant or bizarre creature, Erin never tires of bringing up new topics to discuss with her mentor figures. The beauty of its conversations is primarily what gives Kemono no Souja Erin a unique sense of maturity unlike any other in the medium.<br />
 <br />
Of course, none of this would even matter if it weren’t for our impressive heroine. <br />
 <br />
To put it simply, Erin is a model female protagonist. She’s smart, talented, and dedicated—an impeccable feminist icon. She might be naive and rebellious at first, but after some timeskips, she grows into one of the most independent female leads I’ve ever seen. Erin is forcibly thrown from her home and is constantly on a journey to survive, yet the thought of losing hope never crosses her mind. What Erin lacks in strength and ability, she makes up for with quick wit and charisma. The best example for this is her fateful encounter with Lilan, a “beast lord” kept captive. Lilan has long been declared untamable, but by recalling some self-taught knowledge and the breeding skills imparted by her mother, Erin is able to soothe the feral creature. By performing this outstanding feat, Erin garners the trust of her classmates and teachers who once resented her, as well as Lilan herself. It’s a powerful moment that proves Erin’s sharp thinking and inspirational nature. Among all the female anime leads I know, Erin is second to none in terms of character development.<br />
 <br />
Speaking of Lilan, I have never seen a nonhuman character with half the depth of this majestic beast. Lilan can only communicate using bestial growls, but the affectionate moments she shares with Erin speak more than a thousand words. Whether taking Erin for a fanciful flight or terrifying those around her, Lilan can never be dismissed as a mere beast playing the role of Erin’s pet. She’s much more than that, and I daresay she has the strongest characterization among the cast—besides Erin herself. Although Lilan is aggressive towards humans, it’s hard not to sympathize with her when she displays her softer side around Erin. They become inseparable as the story unfolds, and by the end of the series, their unwavering bond is like that of a mother who finally reconciles with her long-lost daughter. Seldom does the medium present such a touching human-nonhuman relationship.<br />
 <br />
I have split opinions on the rest of the cast. John is a lovable father figure to Erin and the time they spend together is genuinely heartfelt. On the other hand, Ial-lu has the development of a pebble, and I find it difficult to point out anything I like about him. Princess Seimiya can sometimes get carried away with her extreme naivety, but such is expected from a sheltered lass. Duke Damiya and his snarky attitude is amusing, though forgettable. The sons of the grand duke, Shunan and Nugan, maintain an intriguing rivalry that later develops into a fascinating plot point.<br />
 <br />
As for Mokku and Nukku, they are undeniably the most irritating comic relief characters in anime. I’ll just leave it at that.<br />
 <br />
Occasionally, Kemono no Souja Erin stumbles in tying up loose ends. Who exactly are the Mist People? What’s the story behind the two nations? How exactly does ‘alimentary water’ tame the beast lords? These might sound like petty nitpicks, but I couldn’t help but feel dissatisfied without these answers. For a show with such phenomenal world-building, it’s only natural that nothing should be left unexplored.<br />
 <br />
Kemono no Souja Erin also suffers from pacing issues during its middle segment. For a series spanning 50 episodes, it’s understandable that recaps are necessary to keep the audience informed. However, the amount of flashbacks later is utterly ridiculous. Well-timed flashbacks can contribute to the story, but when the same scene is repeated eight times in the span of a few episodes, it’s simply just padding. The show’s middling budget is guilty of causing this, but alternate solutions could have been implemented instead.<br />
 <br />
Nevertheless, these faults become a passing memory once Kemono no Souja Erin reaches its heart-pounding climax. The story departs from its slice of life identity and turns into a high stakes political game before finally bursting into war. Tensions escalate, soldiers clash, and Erin is once again flung into a devastating scenario. However, since our heroine is no longer a timid young girl, the situation plays out very differently. Now wise, experienced, and backed by the mighty Lilan, Erin can steer the tides of conflict and take matters in her own hands. The grand finale is nothing short of breathtaking, and the only thing that keeps it from perfection is the unsatisfying resolution to the entire story. <br />
 <br />
Delivering an earnest coming-of-age tale under the guise of a children’s show, Kemono no Souja Erin is a fantasy epic that is sure to impress with its remarkable heroine, rich dialogue, and powerful themes. Although it suffers from an uneven cast and excessive flashbacks, the show’s beautifully written story ranks among the very best. Erin remains the finest heroine in the medium, and I’m willing to wait however long it takes to see if someone can steal her glory.

    I&#039;m sure that most of you have heard of anime such as Naruto, Bleach, and Sword Art Online, but haven&#039;t heard of Beast Player Erin. Truly a shame which anime are becoming popular and which are becoming overlooked and forgotten these days. Beast Player Erin is a series that isn&#039;t nearly as popular as other modern shows, but it&#039;s one that once you know about it, you&#039;re going to want to watch it, then you&#039;re going to love it, then wish you had known about it before and then be overwhelmed by the urge to re-watch it; this was certainly the case for me. I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169577">
        seen plenty of anime, and nearly none are as unique as Kemono no Souja Erin. Kemono no Souja Erin&#039;s anime &quot;style&quot; is one that is becoming more and more less common - becoming extinct which is very depressing to say. When I first heard that this was written by Nahoko Uehashi, the person who wrote Seirei no Moribito, I knew that I would be in for a great story, and I was not to be disappointed. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around Erin, a 10 year old orphan who lived with her mother in the Tai-Kou region in the small village of Ake. Her mother, So-yon was originally of the Mist People, an ancient clan who have members with green hair and eyes, and is rumored to follow in the ancient ways, practice magic, and hide in the mist. But despite her origins, Erin and So-yon stayed in the Ake village because Erin&#039;s deceased father was the son of the village chief and So-yon was the head Touda (dragon-like creatures used in the war) doctor. Erin&#039;s fascination and love for these creatures becomes the start of her journey to following her mother&#039;s footsteps to becoming a beast doctor herself. But through twists-and-turns, touching-tragic events, Erin becomes so much more; she works her way through to literally becoming a Kemono no Shouja. Unfortunately for her, she realizes that achieving dreams and ideals, while always maintaining happiness and innocence isn&#039;t something that&#039;s easy to do in reality. One night, the Kiba, the Grand Duke&#039;s strongest Touda, mysteriously die. According to law, since So-yon was the person who was charged with caring for the Kibe, the Kibe, she was sentenced to death. Erin the young child that she is, tries to save her mother, but So-yon refuses rescue, and Erin is swayed along the river as her mother is killed/eaten. The devastated Erin is taken into the Shin-Ou region and is found and adopted by a beekeeper. There, she learns of the &quot;King of Beasts&quot; the Ouju. Erin&#039;s spark for learning takes her to the Kazalm Ouju Breeding School, and leads her befriending a baby Ouju, Lilan. As Erin stays at Kazalm and spends more time with Lilan, she develops a miraculous bond with Lilan (and other creatures) that is said to be impossible and the result of this miraculous event? A civil war between the Tai-Kou and the Shin-Ou regions. <br />
<br />
When you first look at the overall story, it seems like a childish fairy-tail story about a young girl and all the wild-life creatures that live alongside humanity. And then there&#039;s the classic friendship bond development, and in the end there is a battle where the main characters fight through trust and love and eventually win. Well, this is not entirely wrong, but Kemono no Shouja Erin is just so much more. There is no age limitations for this series, anyone from all ages can enjoy this series, whether it be 8 year old kids, 18 year old teenagers, 30 year old adults, or 70 year old seniors; this series has appeals for every ages taste. Kemono no Souja Erin is not a short series though; 50 episodes, which could have been the show&#039;s downfall (boring with fillers) but this was not the case. This series takes full advantage of it&#039;s fifty episodes; it takes us though many years of Erin&#039;s life, allowing us to watch her develop slowly in a variety of situations, befriending and bringing happiness, peace towards species until finally the world around her is turned upside down, tragedies unfold, and we see the grand finale of what happens in the end. Although there are occasional brutal, grim and &quot;evil&quot; battles and and violence, the overall series was made for &quot;children audience&quot;, so it&#039;s not a main aspect of the series. The series intentionally keeps itself friendly and relaxing the covert use of narrations, memories, and quiet-smiling peacefulness, making it a loving family series. But the great part of the story is that despite it&#039;s friendly and relaxing scenes, it also retains a certain subtlety in its ambiguity towards its ideological dilemma and in certain relationships. As I&#039;ve said before, it&#039;s not entirely incorrect to call this series a fairy tale, but it&#039;s just so much more.<br />
<br />
Indeed, as you would expect from a 50 episode drama, the start of the series progresses rather slowly. But this story has just so much to offer; from a little girl&#039;s dreams, to societal laws that confine people and destroy people&#039;s lives, to heartbreaking tragedies, to losing one&#039;s will to live (psychological depression), to having loving people bring back your hopes of &quot;life&quot;, regaining your dreams, to befriending a &quot;true best friend&quot;, remembering what your late beloved parents taught you (memories~), to finding your true happiness, only to be threatened by events that could possibly crumble down everything that you&#039;ve spent your life building up, and all the meanwhile overcoming all the obstacles that are in your way, both physically and psychologically. The beginning of the series (6 episodes) centers around Erin’s daily life with her mother So-yon, and her interaction with the Touda and there is almost an ecological tone in the way we delve into the care of these beasts. At this point, nothing much happens other than the beauty or the nature/background art and design of the Touda, and the bond between Erin-So-Yon-Nature. And so... obviously some people will be hesitant to invest a full fifty episodes worth of time for a nothing-happens-much series... But I&#039;m going to warn you right now that if you drop the series, you will regret it for the rest of your somethings-missing lives. Starting from episode 7 until the end of the series, this series will for sure captivate you, and make you actually think, despite it&#039;s seemingly simple synopsis, the story is more genius and deeper(I don&#039;t want to sound like an English teacher but...) than it seems. The fundamental questions of human&#039;s connection with nature, and whether or not it&#039;s possible for humans to coexist with other creatures. In addition. Also delves into the concept of there being &quot;fate&quot; and &quot;destiny&quot;, or perhaps we decide our own lives? And perhaps the biggest concept of &quot;friendship&quot; and &quot;family&quot;. What does it mean to be a family? The series does not present a cliched or predictable conclusion to this ideological conflict, it maintains a sense of ambiguity and pragmatism that the show stays true to until the very end.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, one of the best things about this series is that it never fails to answer all plot-questions; there are literally no plot-holes despite there being so many things that occur, and [philosophical] questions that arise. The series honestly doesn&#039;t bluntly come out and use tons of symbolism like Neon Genesis Evangelion, and doesn&#039;t make it all that confusing to figure out such as Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, and doesn&#039;t have a straight-out answer/writer&#039;s belief to it&#039;s questions such as Serial Experiments Lain (btw this was confusing as hell), but the themes/questions/thoughts are left to the viewer to just decide for themselves what they think. It&#039;s not questions about world destruction, evil, corruption, and the universe itself, but more towards the beauty of relationships, human nature, nature itself, trust, children&#039;s dreams, finding happiness, and growing up (I said the audience was intentionally for kids). The story is easy to follow, so don&#039;t worry about being all confused with weird plot-twists, time-skips, etc... To briefly sum this series up: one of most heart-warming, brilliant, enjoyable stories ever written both inside and outside of the anime community. <br />
<br />
A story like this is nothing without the characters. Kemono no Erin has one of the best character developments I&#039;ve ever seen, with Erin as the basis. Erin is a wonderful, distinctive character – beginning the story with a great deal of optimism, far-fetched dreams and ideals, but through events, grows into a multi-faceted, intelligent, and admirable person who retains her fundamental optimism while being able to recognize contradictions in her morality and confront them head-on. Erin has to face the loss of loved ones, learn that life isn&#039;t necessarily fair the hard way, but through it all has to force herself to maintain a strong face in order to keep others from worrying to much, and eventually overcome the hardships and prevail. When her mother dies in the beginning, you can see her deal with psychological grief in a very realistic, sympathetic manner. It tempers her and makes her stronger in her determination and dreams than ever before. And even when she does make a mistake- a very permanent, painful one- she acknowledges that she was at fault and learns from her mistakes. Through constant struggles and lessons, this series will undoubtedly develop a bond between the audience and the characters, especially Erin which will only lead to a greater attachment to this series (I certainly developed an eternal-strong attachment). Considering this series is 50 episodes primarily focused on Erin, I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll see what I mean by developing a bond with her once you watch the series. <br />
<br />
There are a plethora of other characters, but none nearly as touching or significantly developed as Erin. But that&#039;s not to say that the series does a bad job developing these characters, because they honestly do develop their characters well. Each character plays an important part in the overall scheme of the story. One character I was very fond of was actually Erin&#039;s mother, So-yon who does come up throughout the anime through countless flashbacks of Erin&#039;s past happiness and struggles. So-yon clearly shows motherly affection for her daughter as she conceals Erin from the harshness of society/reality. When Erin questions some things about life itself and why people treat others so cruelly, why human beings and creatures are never &quot;united&quot; as companions, Soyon never fails to explain it with heart-warming &quot;deep&quot; meaning words that stay with Erin her whole life and serves as her wisdomatic teachings. There are other important characters such as the Seh-Zan who fights for neither sides of the war, eventually faces someone whom he&#039;s very close with to find out his answer of &quot;right and wrong&quot;. Other character&#039;s clashes and struggles truly bring life to this rather quiet story. Lilan, the Ouju was honestly the highlight of the series (heh... next to Erin): The beast&#039;s bond development with Erin-humanity is just touching/beautiful to watch~<br />
<br />
The art was magnificent. The art was honestly surreal; it made the series in it&#039;s entirety seem &quot;alive&quot;. The portrayal of nature itself, the lush forests and plains of green to the beautifully designed portrayals of all the creatures in this series, especially the Ouju, Lilan, just breath-taking. Erin herself as well as the other characters were all pretty uniquely drawn up in my opinion. The animation&#039;s seem like they&#039;re for a children&#039;s story show (bright and colorful), but I can full-heartedly say that the art is consistently of high-quality, not in the sense of Fate/Zero HD quality, but a different kind of high quality; you won&#039;t be disappointed. The soundtrack as a whole was average at best, and the series repeats a lot of the soundtrack over and over again. Furthermore, I&#039;m not exactly the biggest fan of the opening/ending themes, although I have to say that they were really unique and intriguing. But it&#039;s the &quot;other&quot; uses of the sound that this series really excelled at. The music was played at the perfect of scenes, and adds just so much emotion to each moment. The music enhances each event in a subtle manner, which most shows fail to do. The &quot;sounds of nature&quot; was perfection; The bristling of leaves/tress, The roars of the animals, The cries of despair; great use of aural effects. The voice acting in this series was phenomenal. Not much more to say.<br />
<br />
The show is one of the most pertinent examples of underrated anime I have ever seen which is why I&#039;m writing a review for this show; to spread word of it&#039;s greatness. With it&#039;s combination of heart-warming story, touching characters, beautiful animation, and old-style soundtrack, Kemono no Souja Erin is a show that is undeniably an interesting and wonderful watch.

    Story = 7/10 <br />
Directing = 4/10<br />
Character Development = 7/10<br />
Editing = 3/10<br />
Animation = 8/10<br />

<br />
While it is an original story with pleasing artwork (the background reminded me of stain glass windows), it is also very long-winded, over-narrated and annoyingly self-reviewing. At least 1/3rd of this production (maybe more) is past footage replayed again and again to the point of nausea. Many scenes simply linger too long on the screen. I found that my finger remained poised over the time-advance button throughout all 50 episodes.<br />
<br />
The story, while likeable, is produced &amp; directed in a bland style. The comic relief characters mostly fail in their mission

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25638">
        and are often annoying or awkward. The climax scenes are consistently and inappropriately violated by the opening theme song (complete with subtitles) marching in like Bozo-the-Clown at a funeral. <br />
<br />
For me, the visual aspect of animation provides a large part of my enjoyment factor. Any anime that avoids the bush-baby-eyed micro-mouthed syndrome, MECHA-SHAZAM-TRANSFORM gimmicks and looping graphics shortcuts that plague mainstream anime automatically receives my attention and respect. The visual aspect of Kemono no Souja Erin does receives high marks from me and is the main reason I lasted through all 50 eps. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is decent. I especially like the ending song, which was unfortunately replaced after ep 24.<br />
<br />
SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin begins as a gentle story of a wide-eyed nature-loving child (Erin) and her relationship with her loving mother, who is the center of Erin’s world. It is animated in a sunny pastel style and appears, at first, to be directed toward small children. This is reinforced by the narrator over-explaining, in the simplest of terms, every single plot development and emotion that Erin experiences, but in the 4th or 5th episode Erin has a front row seat to her mother’s execution wherein Erin repeatedly screams out while her mother is brutally mauled to death (albeit bloodless) by giant man-eating lizards in a long and drawn out scene (opening theme song included). Erin repeatedly relives this traumatic event in detail throughout the remaining episodes. All I could think about while watching this scene was that small kids are going to be watching this. Following the mauling, in the next episode, the only antidote that they offer to sooth the viewer’s trauma is an awkwardly presented farting beekeeper who has a sexual attraction for his horse and an Erin that recovers faster then I did. <br />
<br />
END SPOILER ALERT.<br />
<br />
I advise any parent to preview the first 5 eps before allowing young children to watch this show.<br />

    A girl and her extraordinary bond with wild beasts. An ancient secret hidden away by a mysterious clan that comes and goes with the mists. A growing conflict between the two great ruling regions of the land. <br />
<br />
Together, these narrative threads form the intricate web that is Kemono no Souja Erin, a coming-of-age story that slowly unfolds against the backdrop of political tension. Through the course of 50 episodes, these story lines gradually intertwine and eventually come together to deliver a somewhat clumsy but mostly satisfying conclusion.<br />
<br />
Kemono no Souja Erin is undoubtedly a slow-paced anime. It takes its time to set everything up, and some

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131337">
        viewers may find this unappealing. But for those who love to absorb themselves in fantasy settings, this show will not disappoint. The amount of detail that is meticulously crafted into the history and culture of the land is captivating. And because the relationship between man and animal is such a core element of the show, even the behavior of the beast-lords and their interactions with the main character Erin is explored quite extensively. <br />
<br />
Because Kemono no Souja Erin retains its leisurely rhythm throughout, this gives the show enough time to build upon its greatest strength: Erin herself.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that Erin is one of the most well-developed characters I&#039;ve seen in a storytelling medium, anime or otherwise. We smile with her and cry with her as she grows from a child — curious and endearing — to a young adult burdened with years of experience. From the get-go, we see that Erin is a bright and studious young girl, taking the opportunity to learn all that she can from her mentors. Each stage of her life is detailed in a humble and straightforward fashion. Her actions, decisions, and even morals are a direct result of the hardships that she has endured during the course of the story. Even as she grows and develops, one key characteristic of Erin remains consistent: her resolve. To be blunt, Erin is obstinate, almost to the point of stubbornness. She chooses to remain steadfast in her beliefs, even though she is quite aware of the consequences of the path she is leading. Don&#039;t be fooled by the negative connotation of these words though; they are exactly why Erin is such a human character.<br />
<br />
The other characters in the series are rather hit or miss. Some of them turn out to be bland and stereotypical, such as the main antagonist; others are not really explored fully, such as the Mist People. Furthermore, the comic relief duo of Nukku and Mokku may be appealing to children but will likely be irritating to more mature viewers. Several characters, however, play key roles in Erin&#039;s development and are interesting individuals in their own right, such as Ia-lu. But perhaps the most important characters in the show besides Erin are the beast-lords with which Erin bonds. Their attachment to Erin is very believable; it is touching and tragic at times, but never idealistic. Beast-lords are wild creatures after all, and they rightfully remain as such during the course of the series. <br />
<br />
My main gripes with the show may sound picky, but unfortunately they were severe enough to affect my enjoyment of the show. Recycled scenes and flashbacks are prevalent in the show; one scene in particular is replayed so often that it becomes grating, even though the purpose of repeating it is understandable — for reinforcement. Still, I believe that the show would have benefited from cutting down on the excessive use of such scenes. I also noticed that the same few insert songs were used in almost every episode, and many of them are inappropriately placed. The emotional impact of these songs would be greater if they had been used properly and more sparingly. And as mentioned earlier, the ending (particularly the very last episode) was messy and could have used more closure, especially since it was a 50-episode series.<br />
<br />
I feel like these flaws were the unfortunate result of the show trying to be family-friendly — an interesting dilemma indeed, considering that most of the story is presented with a level of sophistication that no child could hope to appreciate.<br />
<br />
The art in Kemono no Souja Erin is simple, unique, and has a very appropriate children&#039;s-book feel to it. The OST is pretty varied and ranges from soft piano tracks and ambient pieces to Oriental-sounding melodies and even electric guitar tracks. They add a nice touch to the show&#039;s atmosphere for the most part. The OP and ED in particular are of great significance; they are heartwarming at first, but both are replaced about halfway through to fit the change in tone of the series.<br />
<br />
If you can manage to ignore its flaws, Kemono no Souja Erin will shine for you — if you give it the time to do so, that is. For those of you who desire continuous plot development, a fast-paced narrative, or loud action scenes, this anime is not for you. It is an anime for those of you who simply desire a warm and well-told fantasy tale with a solid main character and a truly fascinating world.

    I&#039;ve got to admit that the moment I saw the anime’s image, I thought it was for intended for children BUT I was mistaken. There is an old saying that says you shouldn&#039;t judge a book by its cover and in this case it’s the anime. The plot was great, to be honest I found it promising and it’s really hard to find animes these days with great plots.  And the more I watched, the more I got hocked to it. The developments of the characters are slow in this anime. But that’s what makes its special and interesting to watch. As for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17771">
        art, it’s sort of weird at first but you will get used to it overtime. <br />
I guess all that’s left is for you to go ahead and see for yourself how good it is. I hope you will enjoy watching it as much as I did <br />

    Story:10<br />
<br />
The story starts off slow but its still good enough to keep watching,about episode 6 the story really kick starts and you really get hooked into it,the story is very original and very exciting to watch,but its very simple and straight forward which is a good thing ^^ .<br />
<br />
i found the narrator part in the start of the episodes kinda annoying cause it does this every episode but it still doesn&#039;t kill the episodes :)<br />
<br />
<br />
ART:8<br />
<br />
when i first saw the ART i thought its too childish but i reckon it suites this anime perfectly ,it feels like a children story book kinda art work  but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review23528">
        then again its only the background that feel like that , the characters look pretty decent.<br />
<br />
SOUND:8<br />
<br />
the sounds were AMAZING  it suited every moment although their were some parts that had rock type of music :), i love the song Kemono_no_Souja_Erin_-_Ai  its such a nice melody :) <br />
<br />
CHARACTER :10<br />
<br />
I love erins character shes sooooo lovable and strong willed , she reminds me of john of ark ,i reckon shes the best and most realistic  female character I&#039;ve seen.everyone else plays their part BEAUTIFULLY ,it never seems like its too much or too little. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
<br />
from the start to finish I loved every single second of it :)<br />
<br />
OVERALL <br />
<br />
i wish i can give this anime more then a 10 , i think this is the best anime to ever come out,ive learnt my lesson to never judge a book by its cover , i wasn&#039;t very keen to watch this but DAMN i LOVED IT.<br />
<br />
im sure another anime like this wont be ever coming out , this is easily in my top 10s ,remember to watch this up to at least episode 5<br />
<br />
this anime was soooo good to me that i stayed up till 7 am in the morning finishing this and i didn&#039;t go to work LOL but i dont recommend doing that but hahah

    I&#039;d recommend this anime to anyone. It isn&#039;t a children anime at all. It has War, Drama, Romance and more. There are parts that will make you cry, make you angry and more. Finished watching the Ep 26 Raw and was very moved. I won&#039;t go into what happens but I&#039;m sure everyone will be very touched by it :). <br />
<br />
This is an anime you can&#039;t miss watching!
