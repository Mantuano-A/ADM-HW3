    Most of you may know that Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is a remake of the 1970&#039;s space opera by the same name (bar the 2199). If one were to make a comparison of its significance to its importance of the genre, it is basically the Star Wars of Japan - the series that one would point to as a culturally significant moment in entertainment and the rise of the genre itself.<br />
<br />
In recent times, one becomes wary when they hear the word &#039;remake&#039; or &#039;reboot&#039;. Audiences have reluctantly witnessed so many beloved series, stories and characters get butchered in misguided and unnecessary attempts to be recreated.<br />
<br />
Thankfully,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121245">
        I am happy to say that Yamato&#039;s 21st century rebirth is done faithfully, respectfully, and masterfully.<br />
<br />
First, there is the story (9/10). Yamato&#039;s story is timeless - the people of Earth are fighting back against an alien threat to bring their planet to slavery or extinction. Humanity&#039;s last hope lies in the battleship Yamato, its crew, and a mysterious technology brought to mankind from a distant alien race of people called Iscandarians. Their destination - lightyears away, on the planet of Iscandar. In their path lie many obstacles, and every one a piece of the story and the puzzle. In this respect, Yamato&#039;s story is not difficult to understand, and is something you can appreciate at any age in any time. There are many developments and nuances that shape the story beyond its simple premise as the show develops, however. For the most part, it faithfully follows the original plot, and while I can&#039;t comment on specifics, I know enough to say that with confidence. It is not overly complex - there are also many things that are left to the imagination for the sake of not boring the audience. If you accept them for what they are and don&#039;t convolute them, it is, for the most part, flawless. This is, after all, a fictional universe.<br />
<br />
Now for the art (10/10). There has been some fuss over the stylistic changes from the original Leiji style of Yamato to the remake. However, I find them to be a perfect blend of the retro style and modern style - which still brings an incredibly refreshing artistic flair to Yamato that isn&#039;t seen anywhere today. Even if one were to miss the original style, I think it would be impossible to truly recreate it exactly unless you had all the original animation staff, and that is too much to ask for a 40-year old series. Nobuteru did an excellent job of revisiting the style of Leiji and bringing it to a modern audience.<br />
<br />
The animation is absolutely stunning. It&#039;s quite obvious there was a high budget for the series, and they use it in all the right places. Let&#039;s be honest - in the 70&#039;s, many of the technical challenges that came with animating epic, large-scale space battles were difficult to tackle with the technology of the time. While many are impressive, it&#039;s easy to see where they struggled to achieve their true vision. In 2199, the ships are 3D models, and CGI comes heavily into play during battle scenes. There was a time that this spelled bad news for mixing with 2D animation, when CGI suffered from a &quot;video game cutscene&quot; syndrome. But with today&#039;s technology, 2199&#039;s CGI is absolutely stunning, and blends beautifully with the show and the backgrounds. Every ship is masterfully crafted and detailed, and every nuance of the ships and the weaponry is nothing short of perfection. The excitement of every battle scene leaves you speechless. Fans of spaceships, fighter jets and miscellaneous mechanical things will be filled with nothing but glee.<br />
<br />
The character and 2D animation is equally as important, and is treated that way. There&#039;s a lot of expressiveness in every character, and it shows. There&#039;s a bit of fanservice and moe here and there, but nothing overdone. Yamato takes itself seriously when it has to, but it also has a bit of fun when it&#039;s appropriate.<br />
<br />
The music and sfx (10/10) adds another layer of immersion to the world of Yamato. The soundtrack is a lot of re-recordings of original Yamato tracks, with that 1970&#039;s sci-fi trumpets and backing vocals that many may remember fondly. If not, it&#039;s something that you hear very rarely these days, and is absolutely perfect for this series. It&#039;s enough that the opening is one of those songs you just can&#039;t skip - the rest of the soundtrack is equally inspiring.<br />
<br />
The sound effects, voices and ambiance is also well done. My favorite bits are definitely the sounds of the ships and the weapons during battle. There&#039;s nothing quite like hearing a flurry of lasers, rockets and explosions - and of course, the awe-inspiring Wave Motion Gun.<br />
<br />
The characters (9/10) of Yamato are stunning examples of common archetypes. There are brave heroes, loyal comrades, tragic villains, and everything in between. There is a very large cast of Yamato, so I won&#039;t dive into every character, but while many characters may seem stereotypical at first glance, Yamato never attempts to clearly define the difference between good and evil - at times, you will sympathize with the enemy, and you will question the motives of the heroes. It&#039;s one of those important aspects that helps separate the wheat from the chaff in this aspect. Still, there is a very classical story at hand, and with it come classic characters. But they are not as hollow and predictable as one more cynical may come to believe.<br />
<br />
Overall, there is not much more to say. I gave enjoyment a 10/10 because I always found myself looking forward to the next episode of Yamato - and when they came (the waits were quite long for those following the series release), they were over so soon because I enjoyed every moment.<br />
<br />
It is quite clear that the creators of Yamato 2199 had great respect for the source material and made every effort to craft a remake worthy of the name Uchuu Senkan Yamato. And in every aspect I would say they succeeded, and brought a story that deserves to be retold to a new era, taking advantage of the tools they have today that its original creators did not to remake Yamato in its full glory. And although the eye-candy visuals of space warfare are a spectacle in their own right, Yamato 2199 never loses sight of the story it is trying to tell and the cast that we want to root for, which is where many remakes of this era falter.<br />
<br />
This is a very rare and important piece of animation history - one that I believe deserves to be viewed and appreciated by everyone. I would recommend this series to absolutely anyone, even if they are not fans of sci-fi. If you want an example of a remake done right - this is it.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br />
<br />
Overall this show was an enjoyable watch, and one can sense that a lot of love and care was put into it. For those reasons, this is a very painful and disappointing review to write, but I feel it might be necessary to &quot;warn&quot; potential viewers about some elements of this series that are problematic. Specifically, the plot.<br />
<br />
I understand that this is an extremely popular and influential franchise, especially in Japan, and I also do agree that this is a very well-done remake.<br />
<br />
However - there are SEVERE issues with the plot of this series, issues that I feel are glossed over because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217415">
        of its &quot;sacred cow&quot; status in anime circles.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS BEGIN HERE - do not continue reading unless you&#039;re fine with that.<br />
<br />
- We are expected to believe, and major elements of the plot revolve around, the fact that Yuki, a human born on earth, looks virtually identical to the royal princesses of Iscandar, a planet more than 100,000 light years away, to the point of being mistaken IN PERSON by those familiar with the princesses, to be one of them; that she coincidentally was involved in an accident one year ago that wiped her memory, and coincidentally makes it appear that she may be an alien that appeared one year ago on Earth; and that there is no proof that she is an Earthling because both her parents are dead and there are apparently no individuals who knew her on Earth well enough, except her parents, to confirm that she was in fact living on Earth for more than a year. This entire subplot, which groan-inducingly becomes a MAJOR plot device later in the show, is one of the most suspension of disbelief shattering things I&#039;ve ever seen. I am at a complete loss as to how anybody can swallow this and call this particular subplot anything more than contrived.<br />
<br />
- At one point, certain crew members stage a coup/mutiny in order to enact a plan to move humanity to a habitable planet that the Yamato finds. Not only is this illogical in the long-term - what prevents the Garmillans from simply subjugating that planet as well? - but they stage this insurrection before the planet is even scouted. Perhaps these crew members, one of whom is considered one of the more intelligent individuals on the ship, should&#039;ve waited for more detailed reports on the feasibility of human habitation before initiating a violent mutiny. Bonus points: this plot point could&#039;ve been interesting if the planet was indeed fit for habitation. It is not - it is apparently currently home to massive killer insects.<br />
<br />
- Once the Yamato reaches Garmillas, the main antagonist, Desler, executes his secret plan: he flees the capital of Garmilas and then drops part of a colony on it. The problem with this plan is that there is no conceivable reason to do this. What POSSIBLE benefit does he gain from performing a colony drop and destroying the Garmillas capital? One could say &quot;to destroy the Yamato&quot; - is his plan then predicated on the Yamato deciding to dock at the Garmillas capital? In fact - *why* did the Yamato ram into the capital palace in the first place? Why not use the Wave Motion Gun to destroy Desler&#039;s Wave Motion Gun instead? Is Okita&#039;s plan to storm the center of a galactic empire with a strike team of, at most, a few dozen men led by Kodai, and somehow emerge victorious?<br />
<br />
- Desler is killed when the Wave Motion Gun backfires and his space fortress is destroyed. However, he later turns up to ambush the Yamato in his flagship that is powered by another Wave Motion Gun. How did he survive the WMG&#039;s explosion? Where did his new flagship come from? Why did nobody notice it? How did it reach the Gate before the Yamato? None of this is ever explained. Bonus Points: Yuki, who was ejected from an airlock and is mere METERS away from the exploding fortress, survives - though the blast not only clearly destroys the fortress, but completely incinerates a nearby battleship that is presumably more than a few meters away. Never explained. Forget about these little details when Kodai and Yuki get a great, emotional, romantic reunion scene in space.<br />
<br />
- The Yamato reaches Iscandar and discovers Mamoru had made it there after a ship carrying him back to Garmillas crash landed there instead. Again, there are too many plot contrivances to even discuss them all. Why Mamoru specifically? Why not a human presumably captured in the MANY skirmishes the Garmillans have already had with humans? In a journey of more than 150,000 light years, the ship happens to crash literally one planet over from Garmillas? Why did the Garmillans need human samples? Having transported those samples over such a vast distance, only to have them crash land one planet away, did they then respond by saying &quot;Well, that&#039;s a bummer. No need to investigate and see if there were any survivors.&quot;<br />
<br />
- The timeline for Mamoru, the core of the Cosmo Reverser, arriving at Iscandar is at most later than the Yamato setting sail. Meaning that Starsha was challenging the Yamato to make an unprecedented journey across galaxies for something that doesn&#039;t actually exist yet.<br />
<br />
- Iscandar apparently has a population of three (one after the other two sisters leave for Earth). Why this advanced civilization of superior beings would expend 66% of their population on the off-chance that the planet  Earth, which at that point was no different from the countless other planets subjugated by the Garmillans, could potentially reach them, is never explained. Having invested 66% of their population (No, I&#039;m not going to get over that), Starsha is then unsure if she wants to give them the Cosmo Reverser. She then gives it to them though, despite the fact that those in power back on Earth are shown to be corrupt politicians who initiated conflict with the Garmillans, and will presumably abuse the godlike power they now possess because humanity as a whole has not improved in any significant way to warrant giving them this power. Oops.<br />
<br />
- The infighting between the Garmillans is drummed up to eventually become a major plot element. Too bad we never hear anything about it again or get any kind of meaningful resolution.<br />
<br />
There are more (unfortunately, *many* more) plot points/devices that could be discussed, but I think the overarching point is clear: this may be a remake of an anime legend, great animation, great soundtrack, but there are major issues with the plot that simply cannot be ignored or dismissed.<br />
<br />
Is it a fun watch, and an interesting talking point for discussing the history of anime? Yes. But the illogical, contrived, and occasionally frustrating plot prevents it from being a great watching experience in its own right. Viewer beware.

    Note: This is a remake of the classic Battle Ship Yamato by Leiji Matsumoto which is one of the most revolutionary anime.<br />
<br />
Space Operas are very rare now a days in the anime industry. Just as the quality of mecha anime and it&#039;s audience has been downgrading and declining in favor of slice-of-life, ecchi and harem genres, space operas were always being overlooked at. After almost at least 40 years, one of the space opera classic during the 70&#039;s was given a chance to have a remake in order to introduce the series and gain a wider audience in today&#039;s anime community. But does the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120779">
        itself succeed? Let&#039;s check it out:<br />
<br />
Story/Characters:<br />
Just as the title implies, the show is set during year 2199 and the once blue, green and thriving with life planet earth has been reduced to a radioactive wasteland because of the Garmillas aliens which forced the remaining population to hide underground. However, a friendly alien race from the planet Iscandar contacts the human race and gives them blue prints to build a powerful space battleship capable of retrieving a device to clean planet earth before humanity disappears. As they resurrect the long sunken ship yamato, they then applies the alien technology that they got from a messenger that came from Iscandar, transforming it into one of the most epic and greatest ship that will venture through the sea of stars to save their home planet. Enter Space Battle Ship Yamato.<br />
<br />
Now i know most of you will think that the premise is pretty similar to Macross but the latter was aired during the 80&#039;s specifically after the success of an another behemoth called Gundam while the original Yamato was aired during the 70&#039;s. So therefore Yamato was the one who influence Macross. As i already said from the synopsis, this is a light years journey to Iscandar from planet earth and it will take a year in order to get through Iscandar and they also must retrieve the device in immediately before planet earth is forever doomed. As such we will encounter many kinds of phenomenon and typical issues from this long journeys such as trust issues, food shortage and of course battling their enemies, the Garmillans as they opposed the ship to reach Iscandar. Tactics to fend off enemies were heavily used and while the tactics many not be that good  as LoGH, it still managed to give the feeling of unpredictability of the battles, plausibility of the tactics that were used and you will always be in the edge of your seat with the epic space batles that were occurring in your screen and backing it by great animation and intense old school soundtrack. The series also dealt with mature themes such as racism, genocide and politics. There is also fanservice in this series. Oh, i didn&#039;t mention that? But don&#039;t worry the fanservice in this series is not like in your ecchi show where it&#039;s distracting. The fanservice actually have some subtility. For the most part.<br />
<br />
The characters were no slouch either. They were interesting and likable for the most part and the character interactions were well-written and probably the main forte of the characterization of the show. The way the Yamato crew interact is  just fun to watch. Oh sure there are some characters like our main protagonist, Susumu Kodai who sometimes acts like an angsty teen and some characters do too but they don&#039;t exaggerate to the point that it become annoying. They still act accordingly to the situation and maturely to many situations. Many of the stuff that happens throughout their journey have challenged the Yamato&#039;s crew beliefs about the war and this anime is also not entirely black and white where humans are automatically good, and the garmillians are automatically bad. There are both good and bad people from each side and some good and bad decisions and deeds that both the Humans and Garmillians have made. Okay, maybe i&#039;m saying the obvious but it&#039;s still worth pointing that out. The female cast are also strong individuals for the most part so don&#039;t worry about some very useless ass female characters that you mostly see.<br />
<br />
Overall, the story is great and the characters were interesting, likable and fun to watch to. If there are criticisms that i would give is that there are some more potential that the series overlooked. With a good world building that the show created, that show could have last in more than just 26 episodes and that is why some scenes in the series felt rushed, some characters are really lacking for being fleshed out and development, and there are some very questionable decisions during the end BUT it didn&#039;t really detract for my own personal enjoyment. The original Yamato is also only 26 episodes and most people would rage quit to a series which is over 30+ episodes anyway so 26 episodes is still fine as it&#039;s still be able to tell a great story in a series which the scale and world building is pretty big.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
The studios that brought to us the animation are studio Xebec and AIC. The animation, the crisp of the characters and design, heck even the CGI are just fucking stunning and beautiful. Although some might say differ about the CGI but i didn&#039;t really find any problem with it as it really works perfectly to the scenery of the series and the CGI only made the battles more epic and engaging. The director is Yutaka Izubuchi who is known for directing and creating RahXephon. He was also responsible for the character designs of Gundam Wing. Hideaki Anno worked on the story board. If you didn&#039;t know who he is then you&#039;re probably living in a cave. Akihiro Enomoto whom have worked as the key animator in Char&#039;s counterattack also worked on this anime. Anybody here whom have watched Char&#039;s counterattack knows that the battles there were simply one of the best mecha battle and the animation was just absolutely gorgeous. Akihiro also brought his forte into this series as the key animator in most episodes so therefore the battle scenes, as i mentioned before, were engaging, terrific and epic like Char&#039;s counterattack. It feels like real space ships are really battling it out. As most of the budget were used in the CGI and the battles, the character movements felt really poor in many episodes but you know what? Most of the episodes they spend were sitting in the ship anyway. Just trying to point that out.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Catchy and old school. Seriously, the opening song and the first ending song were retro songs during anime of 70&#039;s but it really fits perfectly well during the series(There are several different versions of the opening. The first opening is the classic version while the other version is still the same only much more modernized). I really appreciate how they decided to bring a retro song as an opening to a modern remake now it&#039;s stuck to my head and i can&#039;t stop humming it whenever i&#039;m taking a shit or taking a shower. The OSTs that was used were also very catchy and old school but still felt intense during the battle scenes. The voice acting is also very well done. Ono Daisuke as the voice of Susumu Kodai who also voiced Sebastian from Black Butler, Kuwashima Houko as the main heroine, Mori Yuki who also voiced Tomoyo Sakagami(Clannad) and Clare(Claymore), Yamadera Kouchi as the main antagonist, Lord Desler who also voiced Spike Spiegel from Cowboy bebop, Otsuka Houchuu as Shiro Sanda who also voiced Jiraiya from Naruto and other famous VA&#039;s. Aside from the the opening songs, the OST&#039;s while catchy doesn&#039;t really warrant to be listen on it&#039;s own which kinda of a shame.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
After watching LoGH and this, i am now craving for more space operas. This anime has many things that i could hope for. Engaging story, fun and interesting characters, beautiful ladies, epic and compelling space battles with great animation and a satisfying ending. It&#039;s really a shame that despite being a remake of a classic with great animation, anime like these is still being overlooked at the anime community today. Hopefully in the future, more anime fans would be able to watch this series and this is one of the primary reasons why i&#039;m doing this review right now. Whether you think this anime is great or not is still up to you of course but if you find this review helpful(which i doubt) and decided to watch the anime and think the anime is good, then please do recommend this to your friends. Then maybe there is hope for more space operas in the anime industry and for this sub-genre to completely not die in the anime realm. Well, it really won&#039;t because of LoGH(Although there is also only a handful of people who have watched this) but you get my point anyway.<br />
<br />
Verdict<br />
Story: 9/10 - Epic and engaging journey to save planet earth.<br />
Characters: 8/10 - A great cast and fun characters to watch to. Character development is there but lacking a bit due to the length of the show but characterization is solid.<br />
Animation: 9/10 - It&#039;s Fluid in the battles and the CGI is good.<br />
Sound: 8/10 - Nostalgic old school music and soundtrack.<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 - Never failed to entertain me and didn&#039;t make me bored while marathoning the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Final Verdict: 9/10 - Amazing anime and a great space opera.

     	To be called “The Star Wars of Japan” you must be doing something oh so right.  “Space Battleship Yamato (1974- 1975) was labeled as such. It’s a show so imbedded in popular culture that I had even heard of it. This was long before even watching my very first anime (To me known as “Star Blazers” for US).  It was truly the show of an age. Now fast forward to April, 7th, 2012, an OVA remake of the beloved classic begins its air time.  The final question of fans was. Will it live up to the original?  Or disappoint us

          <span style="display: none;" id="review122871">
        as much as the 2010 live action movie? Fans were treading carefully, hoping with all their hearts for a good adaptation (unlike many other shows of late). They looked for a great modern re- vamp; both in the visual and sound departments….. and that my friends is just what we got.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	The premise of   “Space Battleship Yamato 2199” is a simple one.”  An interstellar war against a mysterious Alien race known as “Gamilians” (who btw toooottaaallly aren’t alluding to Romans) has Humanity near extinction and the earth nearly uninhabitable in the course of 8 years.  Humanity has given a valiant effort, but is not on par with their enemy. Who by the way has shielding technology and interstellar flight.  But, there is hope, another alien race known as Iscanderians (the totally not alluding to Greeks people) give them the power to arm one ship with their ultra advanced technology.  They must now seek out Iscander and gain a device  know as the cosmos reverse system to save the Earth. This mission is then dubbed “The Yamato Project” and our noble crew heads out.  The Majority of the show is the crew of the aforementioned super ship “Yamato” heading out to Iscander, while encountering harsh resistance by their Gamilian foes.  The show does develop as it goes on. There are a few twists and we get to learn all the races motives and reasons.  Still it’s not a very complicated show; which in a way is where its charm lies. It’s very much akin to well “Star Wars”.  It’s an enjoyable show with very stereotypical, but well developed characters.  Its key level of enjoyment comes from the premise. The one ship vs the galaxy, and wits win the battles. It feels during these times much like an episode of “Star Trek”.  There are great moments of tactical fun in almost every battle.  They usually survive by using some tactical hat trick.  It’s the quick thinking, and patch work of the crew that make this show truly a gem. Its great scale, its fun battles, its tense moments make for an overall fun and well written plot that eventually ends in satisfaction; it’s just a treat to enjoy. (9/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
	The animation was handled by “Xebec” studios, which is a sub division of production I.G. I really cannot say anything bad about the animation. It just seems neigh perfect. Great effort was put into recreating the feel of the show. It did not use the original style, but went for a modern approach. It used CGI for ship battles, and normal safe, but detailed animation for everything else. All is just great. The CGI is some of the best I’ve seen in anime (though not U.S Tier CGI, cus America loves the stuff). It provides some AMMMMAZZZZZINNNG space battles. The animation is well done and details from the original show are kept correct.  Not really many flaws in sight (that is unless you don’t like CGI) (9/10)<br />
<br />
	Music was Handled by Miyagawa, Akira, who’s probably most well know work is… Kirby Right Back at Ya. What I will say he brought in the right people for the job (as the compositions were handled by various artists).  The openings were both well done. The first is a rescored/ revamped version of the original. The 2nd a modern original Op made by “UVER world” dubbed, “Fight for Liberty”. Both the ending themes were also done well, and both present a classic and gentle tune to the show. The Osts though truly shine. Every Ost fits the moment, from sad, to happy and just plain epic.  One of my personal favorites of the Ost’s in the show is the main theme.  The main theme is a sea shanty rehash of the 1st opening that sets the tone for most of the battles. It’s simply called “Space Battleship Yamato 2199” (srlsy I want to take on the Garmilian armada right now…. Come at me bro).  The other end we have the “Garmilian National anthem” it perfectly fits the nation and its proud people.  It’s epic and proud; it creates some of the greatest moments in the show. Such as when you seen their fleet rise up and this anthem plays …. simply wonderful.  What the show does lack in sound is the variance. The Osts pretty much are the same group played over and over again. They are no doubt excellent, but after 26 episodes it can try one’s patience. The Osts in Space Battle ship Yamato are simply great when they need to be. Yet, they are used over and over. All in all it does install a feeling of “retroness” that few can match with its sound track. Thus sound gets a (8/10).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	With a great ship, you need a great crew.  That is what the crew of the Yamato delivers in full. They are really are just archetypes, the main character with loss, his best friends, the staunch captain, and the super logical science officer. Yet, somehow these characters remain somewhat interesting; this is due to the excellent development. Each is stereotypical, but each learns, gains, and looses throughout the show. It’s the crew with there well written interactions goes about the marry task of 1 VS all. With great heroes you got to have some great villain’s, right? Yes, and in many ways the villains outshine the heroes in both motivation, and in charisma. They are in my opinion much akin to Kligons (though much better dressed). The Garmilians also get their development; they are humanized, but not enough that you root for them instead. They have families, and reasons to try to keep the peace within their empire. It adds some very interesting clashes in ideals between the apposing races. The characters in Yamato each get their time and development.  The reasons for their actions are clear to the viewer; though their characters are extremely stereotypical.  This in its own way adds to the retro vibe that Yamato installs, but also somewhat hurts it (but hey they are the originals)….. (8/10)<br />
<br />
<br />
	“Space battleship Yamato 2199” is truly a treat. Its simply fun, and installs a sense of “retro” upon you.  It uses well developed archetypes, fun and interesting plot twists, and great art /sound, to create an excellent remake of a timely classic. Very few shows recently have matched Yamato in overall enjoyment and quality. Yamato, is no perfect show, but is damn well better than most things right now. It is an anime not to be missed for both its fun and charm. <br />
Raptor-(9/10)<br />

    ::Note:: This is a co-written review with myself, Scamp, and fellow blogger and MAL user Shinmaru<br />
<br />
Scamp: Space Battleship Yamato is a TV series from 1974 by Leiji Matsumoto (well, mostly by Leiji Matsumoto, although it’s complicated) about a spaceship travelling across the universe captained by a man with a very impressive beard. It’s one of the most influential anime ever made, considered the point from which anime started to turn towards more serious and complex stories. I shall now ask you to completely forget all of that because instead we’re going to talk about Yamato 2199.<br />
<br />
Yamato 2199 had a bit of a strange airing run.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review113347">
        Each batch of episodes were first released in theatres as single movies, starting in April 2012, and later released in batches of 4 on home video. It wasn’t until April 2013 that its air run on TV even started. We’re 22 episodes in now, with the final 4 episodes to be released in October. Barely anyone in English speaking fandom is watching it, probably due to its weird release schedule and lack of availability. Which is a shame because it’s a complete remake that requires no knowledge of the original. It’s also a shame because it’s a damn fine anime.<br />
<br />
Shinmaru: What really gets to me most about Yamato 2199 is how important everything feels. Not important in the sense of grandness of scope (though there is plenty of that in the series), but important in the sense that everything matters, no matter how small the role a person has in the show. Everyone has a story to tell, thoughts running through their mind, and a heart beating strongly in their chest. The damn doctor barely does anything but get drunk as hell and make sure the captain doesn’t keel over before the Yamato accomplishes its mission, and he’s one of the best characters in the show. Yamato 2199 gives folks like the doc time to breathe and kick it with the captain to philosophize over a few drinks even though every episode counts down the time until the Earth is totally screwed. It’s a classy show like that, you see.<br />
<br />
It’s always a challenge to juggle a cast like this so expertly, but Yamato 2199 makes it look easy. Everyone gets the proper time they need to make the intended impression. Every interaction has the potential to be incredibly interesting, so when a character shows up who hasn’t been around for an episode or two, it’s like seeing a good friend who swings by every so often to tell a fun story. That warmth and familiarity is what really stands out to me when I think about the Yamato 2199 cast. Amazingly, the series has established that camaraderie on both sides of the conflict — battles are more agonizing than ever now, because I don’t want to see anyone die. They’re all so wonderful! Except for that fuckhat security officer, that is.<br />
<br />
Scamp: The appeal is very similar to that of Star Trek or Mass Effect in the way the character interactions play out. During the down moments you get to learn more about the characters as they sit around and chat. The discussion can be everything from big philosophical discussions about where they are going and racism against aliens to little things like relationships and the weather. These play into the usual climactic battle scene in each episode and arc, so you actually care about what’s going on both on a personal character level and broader plot-level. It’s really well paced, hitting your with the big dramatic moments at exactly the right moments so you understand just what it means to everyone involved when it happens.<br />
<br />
As Shinmaru said, they even manage to do this with the aliens. They’re a racist, fascist militaristic regime, but they somehow still feel human…err, I mean Garmillian. They have dreams and beliefs and friends and fears. Even the big boss, who originally appeared comically evil, has wormed his way into my heart through his loyalty and trust in certain commanders. You can start to see why these people admire and look up to him so much. There’s a touch of the Reinhard from Galactic Heroes about him, and that’s not just because of the blonde hair and fabulous cape. But seriously, fuck that security chief.<br />
<br />
Shinmaru: That Mass Effect comparison definitely works, particularly if you’re talking the first game, which feels a bit more old-school science-fiction than the other two in the series to me. It hearkens back to when science-fiction was often about pure exploration — worlds, people, concepts. It’s a journey to find and pick at the hard truths of the world. The Yamato has no choice, but to barrel toward its goal, but along the way, the crew cannot help but think about that journey. Are they doing the right thing? Are they doing this for the right reasons? The answers to those questions and others — if, indeed, answers even exist — are rarely easy or pleasant.<br />
<br />
You’ve probably gathered by now that this is not an entirely black-and-white affair. There are of course good and bad people on both sides of the battle, and good and bad deeds alike have been wrought by the Garmillians and humans. The hands of neither side are truly clean, but there is great dignity to the way people examine themselves and their beliefs. In the vastness of the universe, there is no absolute right or wrong; the Yamato crew comes to discover this time and again, and yet they press forward, unremittingly, if only because they must.<br />
<br />
Scamp: The giant pitched space battles can look a little odd. I attribute this to the CG animated ships looking eerily similar to the ships in Futurama, so at the start I couldn’t take any of the battles seriously. Thankfully as the story progressed, I grew to care about the characters and by extension the battles. Now they could make the battles just be cardboard cutouts of identical ships going pew pew pew with no attention paid to who hits whom with their laser beams (otherwise known as the Legend of the Galactic Heroes approach to space battles) and it would still be riveting viewing.<br />
<br />
If there was one criticism I could level at the show, it’s that it’s a little strong on the male gaze. The original Yamato had only one female on the entire ship while Yamato 2199 has several, so congratulations for progressing beyond the standards set in the early 1970’s I guess. The women do all have the exact same body type, packed into a skintight catsuit while the men all wear more sensible uniform. The camera really does like to focus on their shapely backsides. I don’t mind this as much as I’m letting on. It is a really great arse. I just wish the arses varied from girl to girl.<br />
<br />
Shinmaru: Yeah, I didn’t think the battles looked amazing at first, either, though they definitely looked a cut above most everything else that employs CG. But I’ve grown fond of the battles, even when they’ve done ridiculous stuff like have a ship that acts like a submarine in space through means I won’t mention here. Or maybe that’s why I enjoy the battles so much. But, yes, the battles grow in intensity and spectacle throughout the series, and once Yamato 2199 puts the screws into folks on both sides, then they’re that much more harrowing.<br />
<br />
I’m incredibly excited to see where the series wraps up with four episodes to go. There have been some great reveals regarding the nature of the Garmilas culture and how that relates to their intentions in the war that leaves me with little idea how everything will turn out in the face of the Yamato’s mission. There are so many possibilities; the only thing I am sure of is that the ending will be quite bittersweet, and it’s a feeling that Yamato 2199 has long since earned. The depth of character, story and craft give it a punch that is rare in many mediums, much less anime. I’m clamoring to see the conclusion, but I know I’ll be sad for many reasons when it’s finished.

    THIS COULD BE AN EPIC ANIME... but it falls short. Therefore only 7/10. You will enjoy it at first and then you will get disappointed, wishing it could be perfect. I hate anime like that. <br />
<br />
The story and characters have an epic potential but I don&#039;t know whether it is because it is an old anime or what, but the story has many holes, characters behave really shallowly a lot of times and the anime create really artificial moments in order to evoke a certain emotional reaction in the viewer. All of this makes you feel like the authors treat you as a dumb, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review174699">
        demanding or 12 years old viewer who can&#039;t catch all those obvious flaws.<br />
<br />
For example the crew needs to go asap to one place, but they debate whether to go to 2 other places before hand  and they decide not to go to not waste time. But 10 seconds later the ship&#039;s engine melt and they have to go to one of those places and after fixing the engine they suddenly decide to go to the other 2nd place. <br />
<br />
Or in a big fight in a really intense moment they portray a main character like he died from a heart attack and then 10 seconds later he is standing next to them completely fine with a doctor confirming everything is fine.  <br />
<br />
There is a lot of stuff in this anime like this that turns you off even though you really wish everything would be polished, because the story and characters have an epic potential if made right. <br />
<br />
The sound/music in this anime really suck ass, they are simple and like from 1960 but because you think the story and characters will develop so well you don&#039;t care about the sound, until you realize the story and cast falls short and they you feel disappointed even by the sounds and soundtracks.

    Remakes or reboots often get a bad rap in the anime community as many beloved series often get messed up and butchered in an attempt to add a more modern spin on an already old and classic series. Space Battleship Yamato 2199, however, is a remake of the classic series that is not only able to catch the spirit of the original, but is able to expand further and vastly improve and succeed on what the 1974 version couldn’t do in terms of production values. This OVA remake has become the pinnacle of what a modern space opera should be, and I’ll explain why this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337036">
        is a series you should definitely be invested in.<br />
<br />
Space Battleship Yamato, or Star Blazers as it’s known to us westerners, is one of the most influential and important series to have come out of Japan, and if you’re old enough, you might have seen it when it originally aired in the US in the early 80’s. The show’s themes and story influenced more serious works and series such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Evangelion and Macross; it’s the equivalent of Star Wars here in the west. <br />
<br />
The story of the show is orientated on the journey rather than the destination. Earth is under attack from an authoritarian space-conquering race called the Gamillas that threatens Earth to either be destroyed or enslaved. Humanity receives help from another alien race and are told to travel to a nearby galaxy to receive an item that can cleanse the Earth of radiation and make it habitable again. Humanity receives a capsule that allows for interstellar travel and a means to protect themselves from the Gamillas. We follow the journey of the crew that set out on a massive spaceship called Yamato (based on the famous WW2 Japanese warship) and the epic fights, hardships, and drama that the characters experience and overcome on their journey towards preventing humanity’s extinction. <br />
<br />
Even if the story is simple, what makes a simple story and it’s premise so engageable and thrilling are the different plot twists in each situation. As humanity’s existence is dependent on the success of the journey, each event has a great sense of weight and importance and can greatly influence the outcome of the story if anything goes wrong.<br />
<br />
One thing that the remake blows away the original series at is the artwork and animation, I can only praise at how fantastic it is. The original series is an unfortunate victim of old age and limited and outdated technology, meaning the animators were limited to what methods and techniques they had available during the production of the show, which shows as the show hasn’t aged all that well artwork and animation-wise. Luckily, technology has advanced far enough since then for the producers to use what is available today to its fullest extent. <br />
<br />
Being produced by Xebec and AIC, this series is some of the best works of art and animation to have come out within the last decade or so, especially from studios that aren’t as well known for their animation, or just in general, compared to studios such as Bones, Ufotable and Wit. It’s clear to see that they had a large budget to spend; the animation was fluid and the use of CG is some of the best, dare I say, in all of anime, that’s probably where most of the budget went to; that also allowed the series to have some awesome space fights. Most of the fights were in CG, but you can definitely tell that a lot of care and attention were put into each fight, since each ship and when they’re destroyed and each projectile being fired has a great amount of detail put into them. The producers were able to successfully add a more sleek and more modern touch to the art style, everything looks amazing, and I would go as far as to call it a visual masterpiece.<br />
<br />
Nothing fits perfectly with a space adventure series than an orchestral soundtrack, as the soundtrack for this show is another one of its high points. A lot of the OSTs for this show are re-recordings from the 1974 version, and if you’ve seen the original series before watching the remake, you’ll definitely be reminiscent of the old music. Each soundtrack is used perfectly to evoke and amplify different emotions for the viewer, whether it be intense music for the fights, the upbeat and cheerful music for the crew’s accomplishments, or the mellow and relaxing music in the background as the characters interact with each other and as the ship floats peacefully through space. The OP and ED are good as well. The OP is a revamped version of the 1974 version, which the lyrics sing about battleship Yamato; it makes you feel hyped up and it gives you a sense of nostalgia as well. The show has 7 different endings, and as usual with most anime endings, they are more slow-paced and mellow compared to the opening; the best ending song in my opinion is “Utsukushii Chikyuu wo Shiru Mono yo” by Aki Misato. Overall, the soundtracks for the show are very fitting and are used very well.<br />
<br />
One of the main differences compared to the original series are the number of characters, especially female characters. In the original series, Mori Yuki was the only female character out of the main cast of characters in the crew. However, we are introduced to other characters such as Akira, Niimi and Melda (and many more side characters), making the female cast for this show much stronger. The characters are created from common character archetypes, though it was executed quite well, we see them ranging from the brave heroes to the evil villains and everything in between, the cast is large and full of life. Most of the characters are likeable, well-written and developed, which makes the journey more interesting and fresh.<br />
<br />
We are often presented with the image of good vs evil in most series, we follow the main cast of characters who are the “good guys” who fend off and achieve their goals against the “bad guys”. This series takes a slightly different approach with that notion, different characters have different motives which can affect the outcome of the crew’s mission, whether it be their desire to achieve the mission or to rather resettle humanity on another planet, or to rule the galaxy with an iron fist or to fight off and defend oneself from a tyrannical dynasty, there are both good and bad guys on both sides and we get to see many characters who fit those descriptions. The character dynamics are well thought out and feel natural, and alongside their motives, the characters in this show are likeable and interesting and are overall very good.<br />
<br />
As a fan of sci-fi series and space operas, and that I’m studying astrophysics as a career choice, I found this show amazing and a joy to watch. This show has everything I hoped for a space opera to have; be it epic space fights, amazing music, great characters, fantastic animation, and a satisfying ending. This show is an example of what a modern space opera should be. I would highly recommend this show if you’ve seen the likes of LotGH or any other sci-fi/space anime. Overall, I thought this is a fantastic show, I might even boost this up to a 10/10 if I’m feeling generous enough.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 9/10

    Considering the very high rating, I&#039;m a bit disappointed. Sad to say, because it certainly had potential to be better.<br />
<br />
Characters are not very good.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s debateable whether this is sci-fi or not. If it is, then it&#039;s ultra-soft sci-fi, seems more like fantasy in space to me.<br />
<br />
Several underdeveloped and unresolved side-plots, even a few plot holes.<br />
<br />
In 26 episodes, It&#039;s amazing how little character development they&#039;ve managed to fit into such a simple story, considering other shows with way more complex stories does considerable more in half as many episodes.<br />
<br />
I think this show would be better off if it had spent more time on the characters aboard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335775">
        the Yamato and elaborated on the main plot. Instead it attempts to build an intergalactic universe it ends up not knowing what to do with.<br />
<br />
The visuals and music, however, that&#039;s what this show has going for it. The space battles are as pleasing and spectacular as fireworks on New Year&#039;s Eve. Also, it was cool watching an old WWII ship in space.

Remaking a classic is a pretty dicey proposition. Remaking a benchmark title is madness. Thankfully, the creators of Spaceship Battleship Yamato 2199 threw caution to the wind and faced the challenge head on. The result is a loving tribute to the 1974 anime that’s faithful without slavishly rehashing it.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
Story wise, things are identical. An alien race, known as the Garmillans, have pummeled the Earth with radioactive bombs. The effects appear irreversible until a second alien race arrives from the planet Iscandar with a miracle cure. The catch? The cure is only available on Isacandar. To get it, the Earth needs to send a ship across

          <span style="display: none;" id="review120789">
        space. And not just any ship–an old WWII battleship remade and outfitted with Iscandarian technology. Sounds simple right? Travel several hundred light years to an unknown world with a superior enemy trying to stop you. Oh, yeah–do it in just one year. If you don’t bzzzt. Time’s up. Point of no return.<br />
<br />
You’d think keeping so much of the original would hurt the series–make it predictable. It doesn’t. Yamato 2199‘s writers–and probably its storyboard director, Hideaki Anno of Evangelion fame–do a fabulous job reimagining the series. Each of the show’s 26 episodes feels fresh yet familiar. Yes, key events can differ, but never radically so.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
As for the leads–all the old favorites are back, beautifully reimagined by Yoshinobu Nishizaki. Yamato Captain, Okita, Susumu Kodai, Yuki Mori, Shiro Sanada, Daisuke Shima, Dr. Sanada, are all on board. The cast has a few new female additions, notably 2nd Lieutenant Akira Yamamoto, a brash pilot with a chip on her shoulder, Kaoru Niimi, a new science officer, and Yuria Misaki, a warrant officer who also runs a shipboard radio program. Likewise, the Garmillon ranks have a couple of fresh characters to play with. Their inclusion adds depth to the show, providing interesting points of view separate from the main characters without detracting from them.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
The Yamato itself has never looked better. Crisp, clean lines, more realistic perspectives, and fluid animation will delight Yamato fans old and new. And the battles? Breathtaking in a way not possible in 1974.<br />
<br />
How will modern anime fans feel about a new-looking, old-feeling throwback? Time will tell. Yamato 2199 lacks cutesy romances and harem situations. It doesn’t do super deformed often or blatantly. It avoids comic relief and adorable mascots. And you won’t find a whiff of brooding angst. What you get is an epic tour-de-force. A story of gargantuan heroism and courage unlike anything else in anime. Yamato hasshin!!!!<br />
<br />
5 out of 5 stars<br />
<br />

    WELL <br />
For about a month or so, i&#039;ve been in a rush after work to go home, and the reason for that was because, i wanted to make it on time. In order to watch this great Anime on TV. Every single day at work, i await, when I will be able to leave...<br />
An evening without Yamato is a day not complete.<br />
For anybody who went to High School the name Yamato is known. Cause it is not just the fictional name of the ship in Anime, for someone who are interested in Japanese History and more specifically Military History, like I am, we know much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421505">
        more about it...<br />
So a important History Fact must be mentioned. At the End of the WW2 the Japanese Empire built a warship of enormous Power it was the super Battleship Yamato. It took more than 300 US Military Aircraft to sink this monstrous War Machine. The Mission, which Yamato in real Life was to undertake, it was a suicide Mission. The Military High Command hoped, by sacrificing this ship they could save the Empire of the Rising Sun.<br />
Just like in this Anime, the Star Blazer Yamato must accomplish a Mission, which equals a Suicide, in order to save our Planet Earth. Traveling across vast ranges in the Universe, to another Planet, Fighting countless battles and surviving more than 300 Enemy Spaceships of different types, Yamato succeeds the mission in year 2199. All this Outstanding story is portrayed with amazing Art, no time and effort to details were speared. And the Soundtrack in this Anime is just Masterpiece.<br />
Every Character has their own role and reasons to fight in this war, and in the 26 Episodes all of that is mentioned, we get to know a handful of great characters. Just to mention several of them:<br />
Susumu Kodai, Yuki Mori, Daisuke Shima, Melda Deitz, Elk Domel, Wolf Frakken,<br />
Kaoru Niimi, Akira Yamamoto. <br />
My Advice would be, pay more attention to these characters.<br />
All of this summed, up, made my heart react to every aspect of this Anime. Weather it was a action scene, a more intense battle, or Plot Twist, which got me surprised. Or the few tears during the last Episode, which i just watched today.<br />
(Good tears I mean)<br />
All this is proof, what a great Anime this is. Nothing more, nothing less. I rated this Anime 9/10. And it really is one of, like 5 or 6, Anime i watched so far, that really deserve a score of 9. This really is a great Anime, Greatness at is finest, sort of speak. I recommend all of Anime Watcher to give this Anime a shot.<br />
It will be worth your time.<br />
<br />

    About two years ago, I watched through the original Star Blazers/Yamato series, as well as the sequel and inter-quel movies that accompanied them. While they each had significant flaws (under-developed characters, lack of world building, and short-changed arcs in the case of season 3), I enjoyed following the adventures of the Space Battleship Yamato from series to series thanks to its well-animated fight scenes for the time, thought-provoking (if heavy-handed), exploration of moral grey areas, and the inspirational message that no matter what happens, good will triumph over evil.<br />
<br />
I was ecstatic when I discovered the series was being re-made in the form of Space Battleship

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195620">
        Yamato 2199. With contemporary, more detailed character designs, smoother animation, gorgeous CGI fight scenes, everything seemed to be in place for an show that takes all of the good things about its foundation series and makes it better.<br />
<br />
For the most part in the first half of the series, this was true. But once the series had approached and reached its climax, I realized the show had short-changed many of the plot and character arcs that looked so interesting at the start of the series; almost as if the writers took the easy route and created moral compromises that were simpler for the audience to resolve and understand.<br />
<br />
Story (6/10): Yamato 2199 (or Star Blazers 2199 as it&#039;s called on the DVD releases from Voyager Entertainment) follows the same basic plot as its predecessor. However, several subplots are added that give the series much more depth and nuance than its predecessor. A botched attempt to deal with the invasion of the Gammilas is established, developed, and comes full-front about half-way through the show, relationships and conflict are established among members of the Gamilas staff (who now have distinct personalities), and Dessler is planning some sort of conspiracy he hasn&#039;t seemed to make any of his staff aware of. I have to go out and say that this series does an EXCEPTIONAL job of developing these plots bit by bit, giving them just enough time in each episode to give new info about them without giving away anything. This series kept me hooked week-to-week thanks to how much promising plot material was surely going to be explored late in the series.<br />
<br />
In addition, an plot thread following main heroine, Yuki, implies she&#039;s actually an Iscandarian Princess. <br />
<br />
Very intriguing stuff. But . . . Well . . . On the plus side, the series does bother resolving these plot threads. It just does so in a very unsatisfactory manner.<br />
<br />
Project Izumo&#039;s plan is dealt with in the course of just one episode (No. 16) and derails the sympathy and morality of the plan and one of its key members in the process. The intrigue of the Gamilas staff is dealt with when one, obviously evil member goes rogue, and no dissent and political backstabs are ever heard from again. Dessler&#039;s &#039;conspiracy&#039; turns out to be one of the most fool-hardy, and gratuitous turns since Prince Schiezel and Dewey Novak. And Yuki . . . don&#039;t get me started . . . But they resolved the arc in the worst way possible, simultaneously insulting their audience for thinking their conclusion on what she was was right.<br />
<br />
As opposed to leaving opportunities for audience interpretation and debates over whether certain actions or right or wrong, the series insists on telling us who the guys we&#039;re supposed to feel bad for our, and who we&#039;re supposed to despise. It&#039;s an uninteresting, linear way to conclude these arcs when it would have been much more effective to leave some ambiguity as to who is right.<br />
<br />
There is an arc I can&#039;t really go into detail on without spoiling the resolution, but it&#039;s yet another unnecessary turn that would&#039;ve made more of an impact if they had gone with a simple solution. Sometimes, it feels like the series just goes out of its way to make sure every questionable moral decision is either justified or downright wrong.<br />
<br />
There is only one episode completely segregated from the main plot, and its a story featuring the red robot, Analyzer, who is (thankfully), nowhere near as annoying in this show. The plot could&#039;ve been deep, but like much of the series, it was far too heavy-handed, and without reasonable rhetorical discussion to be worthwhile. Honestly, the backstory in the episode that was basically created for the sole purpose of providing paralells would have been a better way to spend an episode than what they decided.<br />
<br />
To its credit, though, the last few episodes of the show are okay. They wrap up the series well, and the deux ex machina ending of the orignal now has some explanation here. It wraps the series up well for the most part, but a crippling lack of explanation of a key background element where a huge leap in logic is made is never explained.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10): Yamato 2199 excels in the presentation department, particularly in its visuals. The traditional animation is smooth, each body movement serving a purpose in illustrating character. The updated character designs are much nicer and distinct looking than the ones in the classic show, and help give personality to the Yamato crew, as well as the Gamilas characters. There are a couple of off-model episodes (such as 11 and 12 when Xebec first took over animation duties from AIC), but otherwise, it&#039;s definitely solid.<br />
<br />
The CGI, meanwhile, is drop-dead gorgeous. Fights are rendered with far more sophisticaed animation than most TV computer generation. The models of the ships are extremely accurate to the ones used in the old show, with some additional designs and alterations to add distinctiveness. Explosions and particle effects are powerful and breath-taking to the point I eagerly anticipated each fight scene even more than I did in the old show.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): The scoring for the show is done by Akira Miyagawa, son of the composer of the original series. As a result, the majority of the tunes are snazzy remixes of the father&#039;s exceptional work, so it sounds very polished. It  gives the series a retro feel that meshes with the setting very well, as well as the themes of sentimentality. A couple of the tunes haven&#039;t aged well, and sound a bit too old, but the tunes work well for the most part. The opening is a remix of the old one, and is just as grand in scale as it has always been.<br />
<br />
The thing that stands out the most about this series&#039; sound, however, is the choice in ending themes. They&#039;re changed up every four episodes, and they each compliment the arc stories/themes exceptionally well. The first one, in particular, by Aira Yuhki, has become one of my favorite ending themes of all time.<br />
<br />
Character (6/10): Much like the resolutions to the plots, some of the character arcs are rather disappointing. You know it&#039;s bad when I believe the Yuki from the old series had more character than the one in this remake. In the first four episodes, Yuki is established as awkwardly polite with people she doesn&#039;t know, but abrasive towards the enthusiastic attitude some of her comrades have towards war. She&#039;s respectful to her superiors but feel people are too quick to assume war is the only option. Thus, her relationship with Kodai is tense, lessened when she realizes he&#039;s more human then he appears. After episode 5, though, the writers decided they didn&#039;t like the direction they decided to take her character, so they stopped her development. Suddenly, she turns into THE most generic main heroine I have seen in any anime I&#039;ve watched up until now. The writers never decided what new character traits to give her, so they never gave her a personality to fill in the void. As a result, the prominence she gets is very irritating and distracts from a much more colorful supporting cast.<br />
<br />
Dessler is the second big disappointment. Set up as an enigmatic ruler with his own goals who, nevertheless, is surprisingly kind an lenient with conquered species, turns out to be not nearly as complex as he&#039;s seem. Worse, he could&#039;ve easily enacted his plan because of how loyal his staff and people were to him, so his plot wasn&#039;t even practical in the least. I can&#039;t go into much more detail than that, but there is virtually no foreshadowing for it, and very little explanation as to why he&#039;d go to such great lengths.<br />
<br />
Other than that, though, the characters are pretty strong. Okita is as likeable an captain as he was in the original series, Kodai is more strong and confident in himself, making his inevitable rise to Captain more understandable, and his relationship with Shima is more genuine since the latter has a more vivid, friendly, enthusiastic personality.<br />
<br />
There are many, many more characters who I could talk about, but most of them are pretty solid. There&#039;s the witty scientist, Niimi, radio announcer Yuria, cocky gunman Nanbu, old engineer Tokugawa, there are a plethora of colorful personalites that sadly, only have the time to be somewhat revealed during the course of series time. However, each of them get enough development that you feel like you know them, and ultimately, you grow to care about them. In addition, there are a number of female characters added here (a quality severely lacking from the previous series), who all stand out in their own way. Pilot Akira Yamamoto, in particular, is an excellent character, and was teased as a possible romantic interest for Kodai, only for Yuki to take center stage with no explanation. Had she been the main heroine, this series would gain back points in its favor.<br />
<br />
The one other significant character who was interesting until, unfortunately, he wasn&#039;t, is the slimy security chief, Shinya Itou. He has an interesting dynamic with Niimi and oozes with so much evil, he&#039;s actually rather charming. Unfortunately, he goes insane half-way through when his plan starts failing, and boringly loses his composure (again, way too easy to tell who the bad guys are). He actually somewhat redeems himself later on, but it&#039;s not quite enough to sell me on the character.<br />
<br />
Then there&#039;s the Gamilas General Domel, who steals the show whenever he&#039;s on screen. He&#039;s easily in my top three for most favorite character in the series thanks to how straight he&#039;s played as a principled, sympathetic character who&#039;s, nevertheless, bound to Gamilas due to his code of honor.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (7/10): For all of the execution issues this series has (particularly when it comes to climaxes and resolutions), I enjoyed Space Battleship Yamato 2199 through and through. Sure, the first half was a lot better than the second, but the supporting cast and some of the main characters remained colorful, the visuals were top-notch, and the music was great. And even if the ideas were poorly-handled, the new concepts were great potential ways to improve on the original series. And, some of the new ideas, do work pretty well. The aforementioned fair treatment of races the Gammilas encounter? That was really cool, and it made the now justified pale-skinned Schultz a more compelling character. Even if a lot of the nuance is lost, there&#039;s still depth to much of what happened, and being a fan of the original series, all of the fanservice for super fans of the original series was great and helped me enjoy the cast even more than I would&#039;ve otherwise.<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10): It&#039;s littered with character flaws, and anti-climaxes, but I can still earnestly recommend this series. It does have a good supporting cast, solid visuals, and a good main character. Sure, it fails to realize a good bit of its potential nearly as much as it should, but fans of the original series and newcomers will still enjoy this series, issues and all.

    So at the time of writing this review i have seen this artwork twice. The first time was in 2013. Second time at the end of 2017, just a day before 2018.<br />
<br />
Now I must say that after seeing this for the second time I appreciated it more than the first time, perhaps because I tried to delve into the story more and deeper than I did the first time.<br />
<br />
The story itself is amazingly written and while it is a remake of the original series which aired 1974, the remake did not screw up. Every character in this series has a definitive personality which is the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266908">
        driving force for them and there are no characters which are sidelined after a few minutes of screen time. You can feel the personalities and the stories each one holds in them, and you will feel the loss when bad things happen.<br />
<br />
Although the pace of some episodes may seem fast and illogical at times, you have to take into account that the personalities and tasks which the crew members have did not completely take shape during the story, but before the Yamato was launched.<br />
<br />
 *paragraph minor spoiler warning*  For example we are told of the &#039;&#039;Yamato plan&#039;&#039; and the &#039;&#039;Izumo plan&#039;&#039;, both of which were set in motion a long time before the series started, which means the people supporting those ideas had done their choice long ago. And although we do not get a flashback for how these choices were made, it isn&#039;t necessary because what matters is that the choices exist. (This is related to one of the episodes)<br />
<br />
And as for the pacing, not everything happens exactly one event after the other, there are timeskips, it&#039;s just we aren&#039;t shown them because nothing special happens during them.<br />
<br />
Overall this OVA is a masterpiece with a great cast and a great story, and I highly recommend watching it, but to truly feel its greatness you have to delve into it emotionally and focus on the story, because even the smaller things have a meaning to them.<br />
<br />
///PS///Next is rebuking raegazel&#039;s review and why his arguments are false: **MAJOR SPOILER WARNING, read if you have finished raegazel&#039;s review or finished the series**<br />
(point by point)<br />
<br />
- I see no reason why a Terran human and an Iscandar princess cannot have identical looks as they are both human (Terrans and Garmilans were said to have the exact same body structure besides the skin color. While Garmilans and Iscandarians are not from the same planet, they are from neighboring planets, so the species living on either planets should have similar body structures.). And I neither see the reason why this should be a demerit for this story.<br />
<br />
- Time was running out on Earth(365 days to extinction when Yamato left) since Yamato was 35 days behind schedule and they had found a planet where humans could possibly live. While the chance of reaching Iscandar seemed impossibly small with the Garmilans trying to destroy Yamato, which hinted at the possibility of falling behind schedule even more. There was no way for anyone to know that there existed gates which could save time.<br />
      The tests on atmosphere and everything was done while the giant mutant insects could be handled with sufficient human weaponry. As for waiting for the actual tests to come back - the leader of the mutiny was the security Head not a scientist. As long as he got the minimal information that the planet was habitable, it was enough for him to make the decision that humans could survive on the planet, and he really didn&#039;t have much other choice in selecting a planet since that specific planet was the only habitable one in the nearby radius.<br />
<br />
- Why did Desler decide to drop a part of a colony on Garmilas? It was hinted several times before this episode that Desler wanted to get rid of the old Garmilas and him having Yamato get destroyed along with the destruction of the old capital was a bonus.<br />
    Yamato ramming into the capital was so the Desler Cannon couldn&#039;t be used. Okita didn&#039;t expect Desler to destroy his own capital and didn&#039;t expect him to have a ship to escape. In war taking the head of the leader is the main path to victory.<br />
    Not destroying the Desler Cannon with the Wave Motion Cannon is because of the energy amount required to destroy it, and Yamato also had to storm Garmilas and its defensive weaponry to get Yuki back as well.<br />
    Striking the center with a few dozen men is obvious, since if you can win with fewer casualties, why should you make more? Killing countless innocent civilians is not a correct way, especially because Yamato didn&#039;t have much other choice due to poor manpower besides using the Wave Motion Cannon to destroy the whole planet of Garmilas, which was frowned upon by both Iscandar and neither were the crew willing to do something so inhumane.<br />
<br />
-Desler was in his own flagship the moment he boarded the new capital and never left it. While the Wave Motion Gun that exploded was built into the new capital, he didn&#039;t fire the one on the ship.<br />
   Yamato spent supposedly several days on Iscandar(it is not specified besides the fact that they waited for some time). Desler had enough time to get to the gate first.<br />
    Yuki wasn&#039;t mere meters away. It was quite some time before Narron pushed the switch to overload the WMG. While again, the timeframe isn&#039;t specified, one can make assumptions if one pays close enough attention.<br />
<br />
- When Yukikaze was found by Susumu and Yuki, they only found 1 dead crew member. There was no trace of other crew members, while it was shown in episode one that there were atleast 5 on the bridge. This shows that there may have been other members captured, but only Mamoru survived the crash to Iscandar. There is no point in proving why he survived. And the crash was investigated. Starsha herself said she barely managed to hide Mamoru from Garmilans before they arrived. And it is not like they had much authority in Iscandar to do a large scale search as they worshipped Iscandarians as gods.<br />
<br />
- The core needed to revive the planet was memories of it. Starsha couldn&#039;t have memories of Earth without an earthling. Logical. She had the tool, but she needed a user for it, and there is no reason for Starsha to deliver it to Earth without making sure earthlings were worth it. There are no free meals.<br />
<br />
-  It was the task of Iscandarians to bring salvation to all intelligent life. Who is to say they didn&#039;t have a higher population before Earth? Who is to say they didn&#039;t do the same for other planets? It is several times mentioned that it is the task of Iscandar and its sole purpose to bring salvation to intelligent life. <br />
   Starsha is unsure because they turned the WM Engine into a weapon and probably doesn&#039;t even know that earthlings shot first in the war, although how much would&#039;ve changed if they didn&#039;t is up to debate, because Garmilans seemed to have a subjugation policy of surrender or die anyway. She based her opinion on Mamoru, the crewmembers she met on Iscandar and her sister&#039;s, Yurishas, views on the matter. It could be seen she was sad about Mamoru leaving her when she was speaking to the Core.<br />
<br />
-The infighting between Garmilans isn&#039;t necessary to know since the plot revolved around Yamato.<br />
<br />
So I have effectively overturned all the illogical so called *plot holes* as you call them.<br />
<br />

    A journey; a trek; a voyage, that&#039;s how watching Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 feels like.<br />
You know an anime is good, REALLY good, when 26 episodes completed in 4 days feels like 26 episodes completed in a year. This anime just drags you in.<br />
Now let&#039;s get to the review!<br />
<br />
Story:10<br />
The story of Uchuu Senkan Yamato is a simple one: A story of trials for salvation, just like those legends of the ancients. Though simple, it&#039;s executed well and remains entertaining throughout. There are no annoying sub-plots that detract the story, everything that happens is related to the main premise that is to reach Iscandar, which is great

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217383">
        and makes it epic. <br />
<br />
Art:8<br />
The art is matches well and is good, that&#039;s all. It remains consistent; no quirks or anything. and he art is attractive and conventional; not too flashy nor shabby which is great as it fits the more adult oriented nature of the series.<br />
<br />
Sound:9<br />
This score is mostly because of the main theme. UCHUUUUUUU SENKAAN YAAMAAAAAAATOOOOOOOOO. Instrumental or not I loved it. The voice acting was great too, and lively, many characters spoke uniquely such as Sado,Katou and Kodai Mamoru. The sound effects were fine too, nothing too unrealistic or crude. <br />
<br />
Character:9<br />
There were interesting characters from all the sides(Terron,Gamillian.Iscandarian,Zaltzi etc.) and none of them  felt empty,  you will give a damn about most of them. The only thing I didn&#039;t like and the reason I deducted one point was the lack of romance , I mean romance obviously played a part in the plot but there was not much of it. We get to see the outcome of the romance but not much of the buildup nor the transition.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10<br />
Why would you watch a series that you cannot enjoy? As said earlier, Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 is a journey and it&#039;s a very entertaining one. Dull moments are few and are quickly forgotten. I highly recommend this anime, like you should watch it now, like right now, what are you waiting for? Go!<br />
<br />

    I have not seen the original Yamato, so this review has not &quot;old-new&quot; hate or nostalgia. It&#039;s about Yamato 2199 as a singular anime series.<br />
<br />
Story 6:<br />
The story starts strong. The first 8-10 episodes were 10 story-wise, the next maybe an 8 , and around episode 18 and after 4-5 . <br />
I&#039;ve included a spoiler section at the bottom of the post. There I will tell you why such a low score but I advise you not to read it unless your 4-5 episodes deep into the anime.<br />
<br />
Art 10:<br />
It&#039;s beautiful. The backgrounds are great and vivid, the visual effects and animations are awesome and some can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208039">
        even make you re-watch the scene. I think this is this series strongest point. <br />
<br />
Sound 9:<br />
A great soundtrack, is one you don&#039;t notice. An epic soundtrack is one you notice in a memorable way. Yamato has just a great soundtrack. Nothing really memorable, but it fits great. <br />
I can&#039;t tell you about voice acting and stuff, because I don&#039;t know Japanese, the characters sounded convincing.<br />
<br />
Character 9:<br />
I really liked them. It&#039;s great the major characters have a backstory, a different motivation and inner conflicts. Also what I liked is that most of them stayed true to their character traits. They didn&#039;t over romanced it and that&#039;s good, because I hate that trend in animes. <br />
<br />
What I didn&#039;t liked though was some of the villains and that security leader officer, which felt a little too bleak and just put there so the story can have traction<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8:<br />
<br />
Since the story is getting annoying towards the end, it drags down the enjoyment. At first I was: I need to watch the next episode! but slowly it faded into: Just 6 episode left, I should watch them to finish the series already<br />
<br />
--------<br />
Overall 8:<br />
<br />
It&#039;s an enjoyable anime. It has a great premise and stunning visuals, and I really hope in the future they would take the main ideas and make a new one with a greater story and more compelling villains. If you liked Battlestar Galactica,Star Wars or any other space opera then watch this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
!! SPOILER SECTION !!<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The good:<br />
<br />
The story telling is interesting. I loved the fact they didn&#039;t started with Yamato, and they built up the tension and hardship earthlings face. <br />
I liked the idea of a superior technology embedded into a lower technology ship and how it takes everybody by surprise.<br />
<br />
Also the story shines when it doesn&#039;t take the obvious twists: like the fact Mori is not an alien or when they built up to an unnecessary and predictable XO selfsacrifice, then we realise it was just a bluff<br />
<br />
Another thing I liked it in the first part of the anime, is that there are shades of grey: the alien leader on Pluto doesn&#039;t really like war and all he wants is a better life for his family, humans actually started the war, Susumu is sometimes a dick etc<br />
<br />
The bad:<br />
<br />
The fact all aliens are too much alike humans even if they come from another galaxy. And even if we overlook this, because there really are some plausible explanations, there is 0 biodiversity even if the empire spans across 2 galaxies full of unique alien worlds<br />
<br />
Yamato is taking so many hits in battle, just to be as fresh as ever in the next battle which is then even more destructible, and still packs a heavy punch. It&#039;s stupid how in impossible situations there is always a lucky deus ex machina part... <br />
<br />
The last part of the anime is going full retard. Iscandar is so lame and barren and the princess living there is dumb like a brick. The fact humans reach there do nothing there, just get some boxes and then come back is dumb, because all they wanted was an 1 shot device that restores the earth, and there was no need for them there. <br />
<br />
Also is stupid to request for a ship to go the twin planet of the net superior enemy and on top of that then complain why you used a powerful weapon. The only way even the writers saw this plausible was from a plot device where they force the main fleet to be 2 month away. I mean what where the odds of that happen when that princess made her genius plan?<br />
<br />
The fact they reach there and on top of that solve the whole galactic problem with the dictator, destroyed a quarter of its fleet and war and so on . Why on earth they have to save everyone ?  Couldn&#039;t they just leave this be without turning Yamato in Goku 2.0 ?  <br />
<br />
Dumb plot devices and motivations towards the end: the terraforming devices is wait for it ... the main characters long dead brother. Yep. The prince of Gamillans after his presumed death, tries to take over Yamato, fails and then said: &quot;Lets suicide and stuff just because&quot;, or lets kill Mori just to revive hear 1 episode away because were out of ideas and we need some dramatic shit<br />
<br />
The list can go on. <br />
<br />

    Science Fiction always been one of my favorite themes, the incredible creativity that space exploration can use is in essence infinite. Unfortunately good science fiction shows are rare, and, Yamato 2199 is, in my opinion, not one of the good ones.<br />
<br />
The initial episodes were good, they had a slow pace with proper introduction of characters and solid world building. The plot went forward in an digestable and reasonable way. But it also became clear that this show wouldn&#039;t take itself seriously. Gradually it downgraded in quality, and, by episode 11 it became apparent that the story would just be your averagely bad dumb space soap

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371317">
        opera in space where everything follows the law of convenience to fulfill drama requirements. Actions made by characters are illogical or downright pathetic if it creates a bit of drama, the characters which at first looked like adults, gradually become emotionally unstable children with temper tantrums in space. Aren&#039;t this supposed to be the best humanity has to offer?<br />
<br />
It quickly became a boring show, with the typical space tropes kicking in, which it would be ok if they were well done. The lazy storytelling was overwhelming, no regard whatsoever for logic, and at least two absolutely unbelievable moments of outstanding ridiculousness that sentenced this show to mediocrity. And I mean it, this were among the worst scenes I ever watched in my life.<br />
<br />
But not everything was bad, animation, drawing style, effects, backgrounds, they had above the average quality for anime. It had good action moments, and, if one ignores the nonsense, it was a well paced show. The characters aesthetic design is quite good for my taste, and most of the characters were actually interesting, likeable and some relatable. The voice actors also did a good job, and a special thumbs up for the main villain voice actor, what a magnificient voice for that character and such a good voice acting. The last episodes were also ok, not over the top nonsense. This positives kept me going until the end, where usually I would have dropped it.<br />
<br />
In the end, its a real shame, this show could have been easily an 8/10 but it failed on key areas. A chain is as strong as its weakest link.

    For those that wonder about this anime, you might not partially like space-related anime. But I warn you, give this anime an chance. I wasn&#039;t too keen on watching this show but I gave it an chance. And guess what? I was surprised that I actually liked it.<br />
<br />
People praise this anime saying that this remake was made from an classic of an old anime. Now I see what they were talking about. I agree with them. This anime is awesome!<br />
<br />
When many people, hear remake or &quot;reboot,&quot; they get turned away but I assure you that this anime will meet your expectations and then leave you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178776">
        wanting more.<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
There is a strong story here. The planet Earth is fighting for it&#039;s survival, against an alien threat. Either extinction or slavery. But hope isn&#039;t gone for humanity. Battleship Yamato was built, in order, to travel across the universe to the aliens, Iscandarians, who brought a mysterious technology. They made it possible for the humans to build the Yamato. Obstacles are presented throughout their journey, expiring more bits of the story and the puzzle. The story isn&#039;t hard to understand but it is nonetheless enjoyable to watch. There are many developments and annoyances that help shape into something more than the simple premise of the story. For the most part, it follows the original plot, I cannot say what but I can say it follows it confidently though. It is not overly confusing or complex - there are also many things that is left for the audience to ponder and wonder so the they are boring them. If you expect more out of the anime and come in with a clear mind, you will be happy and see a flawless anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
The art was beautiful. Visuals were amazing. It was like a breath of fresh air when compared to other anime. Originality.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
I have no complaints with the sound. It was on point.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
<br />
There is a big cast of characters in this anime. Sometimes when that happens, it can ruin shows. But this isn&#039;t the cast. You see the brave heros, loyal comrades, tragic villains, and whatever else in between. Some characters may seem stereotypical but it soon changes as you watch more. At times, Yamoto, doesn&#039;t define the difference and you can sympathize with the enemy, questioning the motives of the heros. It&#039;s important that it separates the wheat from the chaff in this aspect. Still, there is a classic story at hand and classic characters. But they are not as hollow and calculable as one more suspicious may come to believe.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
This anime has a lot going for it. The story was awesome. A lot of the music was from the original, which was nice. Characters were awesome and I loved seeing the characters change and grow. There were different types of emotions being experienced.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I am happy to say I recommend this to anyone because it is that AMAZING. It&#039;s an awesome remake of an classic anime. It is very much re-watchable. It deserves the praise that it gets. I hope everyone else enjoys this anime as much as I did.

    Wow!  This show absolutely blew me away!  I haven&#039;t enjoyed a series so much in a long time.  I&#039;ve been going through movies and shows, from all sorts of genres and eras and styles, and rarely does anything have everything I want to see in an anime, and this is one of those!  I&#039;ll admit, I put off looking into any of the Space Battleship Yamato series or movies simply because the surface concept seemed so outrageous - a World War 2 style battleship...IN SPACE?  That&#039;s CRAZY!  I could not have been more wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
There&#039;s drama, space battleship combat, intrigue,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review151773">
        romance, loss, love, hope, despair, inspiring and despicable characters, great music (I love the intro, its like nothing else out there in this age of anime), great interstellar scenery and locals, and so much more.  The way the combat is played off as a mix between spaceships and battleship-era naval combat is an amazing style choice.  The true definition of a &quot;space opera.&quot;  Its almost a shame I&#039;ve watched this now as everything else I watch that tries to be anything like it will likely never be quite as good.<br />
<br />
Could I nit-pick the show if I really wanted to find something &quot;wrong?&quot;  Surely. Nothing can ever be &quot;perfect,&quot; but for me personally Space Battleship Yamato 2199 comes close.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, from start to finish, and for once feel truly satisfied by the end of the show.  I don&#039;t need to see more, I don&#039;t think anything was left out, and I don&#039;t disagree with the choices made.

    It is so difficult to rate. It&#039;s quite enjoyable but also has so many irritating faults. Not to mention that it&#039;s rated really high and by that was a total letdown.<br />
<br />
The overall idea is great and the only thing that kept me from dropping it. It was enjoyable but I&#039;m still half-thinking it was wasted time.<br />
<br />
-----possible spoilers ahead-------<br />
<br />
Plot is net, meaning more holes than substance. A wide universe but Yamato always manages to step into a trap when far away from enemy planet but can move easily when close to it. And the whole plot net is held together by string of once in a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review256888">
        life concidences. Yuki&#039;s appearance, the accident.<br />
<br />
The science is really bad. So bad that I wouldn&#039;t tag it as SciFy (Military too but on that later). First of all, I guess you figured out the author is really into boats and submarines. I could accept Yamato designed after a boat (but even that is so unrealistic) but putting in submarine surfacing or submerging for different situations like other dimensions is pure a-pull. And to expect me to believe races from far away use similar designs? And are really similar to humans (in both appearance and culture)? This is clearly a lack of imagination (and possibly of knowledge how evolution works). Then there are the canons that look like shell canons (and in fact are capable of shooting shells too which is the most impossible thing here), where no possible difference of how laser weapons work are thought of. <br />
Also, some currently unavailable technical improvements are used like powerful lasers, thrusters, FTL but everything still looks like 90s. It might be a remake of an old series but some visual improvements would have been nice. If the 70s version was the same then that was innovative but this just seems like low effort. And it seems like mediacal technology didn&#039;t evolve much except for some narrow areas (like prostetics). then there is the robot with AI but AI is not utilised much elsewhere as are robots in general. there is only 1 robot that can do everything but not specialized robots for difficult jobs that in the show are still done by humans. This is getting long and I could go on if I thought a minute.<br />
<br />
They are military but rules are only obeyed as long as they look cool. Not to mention that commanders do everything (then who does the commanding?), they are not superhumans who can do 3 people&#039;s work. Which military would allow a commander to go to the front lines and leave people under them to think for themselves?<br />
<br />
Characters are pretty decent, I&#039;d say definatelly get me invested in them, rooting for some and hating others. But there are moments where they are made out to be really dumb (but that&#039;s just bad writing). I would never say they are logically sound, for one thing they are placed in military hierarchy but don&#039;t care for it.<br />
<br />
While I&#039;m writing it, I do realize it has a lot of faults but somehow it&#039;s still enjoyable. Most of it&#039;s plusses are probably from the original and most of it&#039;s faults are probably due to lazy remake (either the 20 year difference was never thought of or the staff of the remake has no knowledge of technology or SciFy).

    I was originally going to rate this a 7, because while I enjoyed it, I didn&#039;t think the story was all that remarkable - heroes go out into space, defeat the universe, and save the planet - you&#039;ve seen it all before right? But then I considered how much I like the characters, and the little things that must have been thought about to make everything flow; there was nothing in the series that dragged on or rushed through, or that didn&#039;t somehow contribute to the plot or the characters, and it results in a very wholesome feeling anime.<br />
I&#039;m watching this as a person who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264805">
        is new to the series, so I can&#039;t really comment on comparisons to the original, but even so I could clearly see how it paid homage to the 1970&#039;s version, especially in the OP and sound effects, but also in the design of the characters, which had a modern polish, but still a recognizable retro feel to them. While it may be a little lost on people new to the genre, I&#039;m sure those who&#039;ve watched the original series will fully appreciate it.<br />
I was also surprised by how well CGI was integrated into this anime. Usually CGI in anime is enough to make a lot of people turn around and walk away right then, but, although it is still obvious when CGI is used, I didn&#039;t find it to be painfully so like in most anime. When working with complex moving forms like battleships - and then fleets of battleships - it&#039;s understandable why CGI was used, and although there are a few odd moments with water and explosions being overly detailed, generally it blends really well, although it probably helps that it&#039;s never applied to living forms.<br />
Overall, I felt the characters were all likable, and I really enjoyed the progression of their relationships, in spite of a few cheesy moments that were probably unavoidable being a remake from the 70&#039;s! Although the story may not be that original, when it first came out it probably was, and I think this anime, being well-made and well-rounded, truly deserves flagship status in this genre.

    So in the beginning I was super hesitant to give this a shot due to the low-ish ratings. OMFG I am so freaking happy that I forged ahead anyways. Seriously, this show is SO damn underrated ...<br />
<br />
 It has a superbly woven mastery to it that you just do not find in a lot of shows, and I love a good sci-fi.  Did I mention ACTION PACKED TO THE HILT?!! I know it is a remake so this opinion is based solely on this reboot. Are there a few corny moments that happen... yes. Will all be forgiven considering you will be hanging off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263182">
        the edge of your seat more than once? Hell yes. I so respect a well thought out, cohesive story with believable characters more than I detest any other flaws I came across. The musical scores were simply amazing and so well timed, seriously bravo. It gave me a James Bond-esque vibe and I watched every single James Bond movie as a kid, so perhaps I am slightly biased. The character designs/set/costume were different and intriguing. <br />
<br />
Best part? As an adult, I didn&#039;t feel like my senses were being dulled with fluffy filler or immature moments that I couldn&#039;t relate to. <br />
<br />
Cons: The ship designs could have been a bit more &quot;futuristic&quot;, but then again I believe the original story was written in the 70&#039;s/80&#039;s -  (it was so much action that after a while I didn&#039;t even care). The alien races were all a bit too &quot;humanoid&quot; and they could have done better than just changing skin color, although the creativity with the worldbuilding (to me) offsets this.  I wont spoil it, but the &quot;miracle&quot; that happens at the end might make you do an epic eyeroll. <br />
<br />
I give this a 10 due to the fact I was literally drawn into the story like I haven&#039;t been in ages, and for someone who is not easily impressed that is priceless.
