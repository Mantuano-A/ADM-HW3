    Re:Zero is about Subaru. He is the protagonist, the hero, and the center of the universe.<br />
<br />
I understand why people love Re:Zero. The characters are likable, it has high production values, it is genuinely scary at times, and the emotional climaxes are handled well. Most importantly, it is one of the best isekai anime out there. The rest of the genre pales in comparison. Despite its successes, I don&#039;t know where season 2 is going.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero is famous for subverting typical isekai power fantasy tropes. For the first few arcs, it stayed true to this premise. Subaru&#039;s power, Return by Death, means he can shift the spacetime

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358650">
        continuum at his leisure. He quite literally controls the universe. When he fails he simply tries again. He is like a child who continuously saves and reloads a video game whenever he loses a fight. Rather than living with the consequences, he retries until he gets the optimal playthrough. The narrative revolves around Subaru as well. We see every other character from his perspective.<br />
<br />
Subaru is capable of controlling his power at will. He can die whenever he wants. As painless or as painful as he wants. Watching him die time after time is horrific at first. Gradually, it desensitized me to the violence. When I first ran over a pedestrian in Grand Theft Auto, I felt pretty bad. After hitting the 100th innocent bystander, I didn&#039;t give a shit because they&#039;re NPCs. The only way Re:Zero thrilled me was by upping the violence, gore, and screaming. And this season did not disappoint me. Stabbing, dismemberment, decapitation, and so much more. Subaru&#039;s voice actor abused the hell out of his vocal cords to make such visceral screams. Yuusuke Kobayashi deserves an award for his dedication to the role. Listening to the visceral anguish in his voice gave me second-hand trauma. He embodied Subaru’s insanity. Putting aside the superb acting, foundational narrative problems persisted. The penalty for his Return by Death ability is supposed to be his loss of sanity, but it isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
Despite all of the gruesome deaths he experiences this season, he returns to normal shortly after resetting. His sanity survived starvation, witnessing his friends getting gutted alive, suicide, and many more horrific events. His ability to bounce back from his insanity initially impressed me. From the way I see it, he overcomes his trauma in an unrelatable way. He can vent his emotions to a multitude of friends. Few people are that lucky. Due to the nature of Return by Death, he cannot explain the context. Simply saying, “I am hopeless, lost, and I need help,” is enough. He has lots of shoulders to cry on. Having friends and family to support you is crucial to surviving trauma. I can relate to Subaru in this respect. Though, I lose empathy for him because he quickly returns to normal. One could argue he conceals his honest emotions. I would disagree. If this were true, the cracks would show and reveal his consistently broken mind. Last season, we got a glimpse of how PTSD destroyed him. Subaru&#039;s mental breakdowns were brutal. In this season, that development forgotten, spare for a few brief flashbacks. Subaru’s power only has one real drawback. He cannot control where the save points are for when he resets. This isn&#039;t much of a hindrance relatively. It&#039;s like saying my shotgun isn’t powerful because it has two barrels instead of three.<br />
<br />
I love death in Re:Zero. Death is when the show lets loose. The production values increase, the voice acting hits a fever pitch, and it’s completely chaotic. This season amped up the traumatic deaths above the first season. Despite being well directed, the episodic dose of ultra-violence was comparable to taking sleeping pills for a week. Eventually, you need more just to fall asleep. It stops being effective. Even Subaru became desensitized to violence. He watched people get murdered ruthlessly, sometimes he just stares at the carnage. The series is, thankfully, self-aware enough to address his unintentional apathy. He knows he can bring his friends back to life if they&#039;re killed. The only thing sad about the deaths is that the character loses any development they got in that time loop. We typically gain knowledge about said character’s personality, secrets, and motives, but their development is lost until the successful run. When someone is killed, they will come back to life in the next loop. The side-cast had very little development, as such their deaths rarely devastated me. Subaru uses his power selectively, indicating which of his friends are worth dying for. When Rem is comatose in the first episodes of this season, Subaru he immediately turns back time. When Otto dies, Subaru keeps going. All meaningful development is lost when Subaru dies. When Otto says he thinks of Subaru as his friend, it is emotional, but that information changed nothing. Now&#039;s the perfect time to digress and talk about the most underlooked character in the show. Otto.<br />
<br />
Otto is a kind, caring, loveable sidekick. For the duration of this season, he is a static character. He has a very wholesome crush on Subaru. I can&#039;t imagine why someone wouldn&#039;t like him, except Subaru. He acts grossed out by Otto’s affection. But when a girl becomes affectionate towards him, he reciprocates and trusts her. There are no other affectionate male characters in the show. I have no idea how he would respond to a man confessing to him. I doubt it&#039;d go well considering Subaru’s dedication to being masculine and heroic. And that&#039;s the single worst thing about Subaru. His hero complex. I hoped he would confront himself this season, but that was not the case. His toxic personality remained the status quo.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, Subaru is manipulative of Otto. He often cuts off conversations with Otto out of annoyance. For example, a supporting character calls Otto a cab driver and, of course, he is offended by this. Subaru smiles and says “I’ll pick up what’s left of you.” A darkly comedic joke. Otto responds with “Why is everyone so mean to me?” then Subaru quickly manipulates him by saying “What do you mean? Emilia only stayed safe because of you.” Referring to when Emilia passed out with only Otto nearby. Emilia is incapacitated and helpless a lot this season, like a damsel in distress. But her life was never in danger. Having seen the prequel film, Frozen Bond, I know she can hold her own in a fight. Otto blushes anyways, then happily rides off. Subaru turns back to the girls and snidely says “Too easy.” You’re a clown, Otto. A human punching bag. Know your worth man. Move on. The way Subaru treats Otto is emblematic of a larger problem I have with him. He&#039;s still a jackass with a shitty personality. They haven&#039;t subverted the typical self-centered isekai protagonist. That is just who Subaru is. Until he has a wake-up call, he will not change.<br />
<br />
I’m looking forward to seeing Otto&#039;s character arc next season. I’d also like to see Emilia more utilized. Emilia’s role in this season was much less than the first. She was present in every episode, but she had little agency of her own. In the second episode she said, “Next time, I won’t be the one who always needs saving. I’ll become someone who can help others.” After a whole season, that change never happened. She was still the same. I would easily pick her as my favorite character because of how she challenges Subaru’s hero complex. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen much in this cour. This season primarily consists of dialogue, lore exposition, and progressively frightening horror scenes. The dialogue is directed with the standard shot-reverse-shot style, which makes for very dry scenes. They spice up the frames with some visual symbolism. In an early episode, a knife is pointed at Subaru on a table when he talks to a comatose Rem. This happens directly after an incident involving a knife. He tells her about how he would die to save her. This is very unsubtle symbolism, but it is at least an attempt at visual depth. I was a bit annoyed the director used the same symbolic knife again in this shot. The heavy-handed symbolism spoonfeeds the audience. Unfortunately, this issue persists throughout the show. There were many wasted opportunities for great visual storytelling.<br />
<br />
Roswaal is a prominent character this season, whose aura is very enigmatic. His scenes with Subaru are tense and generally well written. He condescends to Subaru and clearly holds back information. The director could’ve easily made their conversations more thrilling with better framing choices. For one, he continues to use the shot-reverse-shot. What he could’ve done is show Roswaal towering over Subaru, like the intimidating foe he is. Roswaal is over six feet and Subaru is 5’8”. With a more creative framing, these scenes could’ve been great. Another thing to add, the soundtrack for Roswaals scenes induce anxiety so well. For the first three times. Hearing it for the fourth, fifth, seventh time made it lose its effect. Overall the directing is fine, but moments like this let me down. The director had another problem of using dutch-angles excessively. Dutch angles used sparingly to startle the audience and remind us we&#039;re watching a TV show. Instead, he just throws them in at random rather than building tension naturally through dialogue and creative storyboards. <br />
<br />
I hate to be the one to say this, none Re:Zero’s lore is interesting to me. It feels tacked on to Subaru’s journey to save Rem and his friends. Notably, this season is MUCH more lore heavy than the first one. Sadly, the show has a tendency to conflate plot with lore, except, they&#039;re not the same at all, but it spends much more time on the latter. The lore and Subaru are disconnected from each other. We’re introduced to multiple new witches, with a few fantastic character designs, but their dialogue is uninteresting. Like Roswaal, they speak superfluously to seem deep. It has an adverse effect, making them seem pretentious. I’m still trying to figure out if this was intentional or not. The lore delivered to us doesn’t affect much in the show’s setting. In fact, Re:Zero’s setting is very static. We never meet well-rounded commoners of this world. The only ones with dialogue are children, to make us fear that they will be killed, and others who deliver convenient information. We never get a sense of how the mythology from years ago impacts day-to-day life. If Subaru interacted with common people more, like Felt (I miss her), the setting would much more interesting.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero Season 2 Part 1 is an impressive display of an animation studio’s perseverance. The staff had to work from home due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Still, they managed to produce passable work. While its art is a step down from the initial season four years ago, I’m impressed with what they created. This season magnified all of the flaws of the first one, nonetheless, it is an engaging watch. While heavily flawed, this season provided more mysteries to untangle, thrilling sequences, and unrestrained horror.

    Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers<br />
<br />
&quot;When will the suffering end?&quot;<br />
Subaru enjoyed his slice of life time in Isekai Quartet but now his suffering once again starts with Re:Zero season 2.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
<br />
Alright, so there are a lot of mysteries that were not at all answered in season 1 and frozen bond OVA like:-<br />
Who is Satella?<br />
What happened to Subaru&#039;s life in Japan now that he has disappeared?<br />
What were Roswaal&#039;s true intentions?<br />
Why were Emilia and other people of Elior forest frozen? And who were the people who we saw in flashbacks in Frozen bond?<br />
Plus many more!<br />
We finally get to know more about Re:Zero world and a little about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358348">
        the other witches. Plus we also get to see a glimpse of Subaru&#039;s life before he was isekai&#039;d and also get to meet all the witches. <br />
We also see new archbishops in action though only for a while. Elsa is finally back and is ordered by someone to kill people in the mansion. <br />
Subaru has completed his first trial but unfortunately Emilia is too traumatized due to the first trial and is not able to pass it even after trying many times. But unlike Subaru whose trial was shown to the viewer, Emilia&#039;s trial is kept a secret for now. <br />
Puck hasn&#039;t come out since Emilia entered the sanctuary and considering how Emilia is traumatized due to Roswaal&#039;s plan plus the rabbits attacking the sanctuary, Subaru tries to complete all trials instead. <br />
But only failure awaits him in his second trial. So with the sanctuary sealed off and the rabbits about to attack at the same time when Elsa attacks the mansion, Subaru is in a tight spot now. Who to save? <br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
<br />
It could have been better but due to the pandemic, I guess it is to be expected. The art is more or less just like season 1.<br />
Though some scenes were beautifully animated like Emilia and Subaru sitting outside on a starry sky. <br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
<br />
The OP is a banger and ending song is decent. Some OSTs from season 1 are also used. New OSTs are also present and they are decent. <br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
<br />
Really loved Satella&#039;s dialogue when she confronted Subaru after he was traumatized due to his second trial. It was really emotional.<br />
Otto gets good development this season and his interaction with Subaru are good. Ram also gets a lot of screentime and helps Subaru. <br />
Garfiel seems like a mysterious character who feels like a friend in one loop and foe in another loop. Echidna at first seems kind and cute but her true intentions are revealed on how she tried to manipulate Subaru but thanks to Minerva her plan was foiled<br />
Emilia is funny and cute as always. Plus she and Subaru have gotten quite close after season 1. <br />
And after witnessing Subaru&#039;s first trial, we find out about his insecurities, his life and his relationship with his parents before he was isekai&#039;d. And as of now due to all the stuff happening this season, his suffering has gotten more intense. <br />
It was also good to see Subaru supporting Emilia after the trials and providing her emotional support. Emilia seems to have gotten quite <br />
fond of Subaru now and even got embarrassed. I love their interactions. Their relationship is very cute.<br />
Roswaal&#039;s character has always been mysterious but here we get to know how he knew of Subaru&#039;s ability to return and follows the plans that his gospel lays out. We also get to see Roswaal&#039;s true intentions and how he planned out many events in the story<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
Waited 4 years for this! I really enjoyed each episode. Can&#039;t wait for the second cour<br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
<br />
A lot of suffering this season for many characters. Really want to see how this mess will be sorted out.

<br />
Grief, trauma, sacrifice, burden, despair, depersonalization, and perseverance. This is what the dark and harsh reality of Re: Zero calls to wake Subaru up from his blind confidence and optimism before the light of hope and darkness of despair. It is a charm of suffering with a vicious substance in the depth

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358354">
        of loneliness. The world with shine and gloom bestows one’s fate to realize before his eyes and crawl through the walls of fear. The horror of solitude craves him to curb his fancy by the answer of truth. With answers and consequences, what fate will judge Subaru according to his deeds? <br />
<br />
With his weak yet “immortal’’ ability called Return By Death, Subaru must determine if his hope will either remain him standing or cripple him out till the corner of despair. Lost in the new world, he found his hope to grasp away from the solitude and build up with his smiles and plays as Emilia and others share the bond together. He truly wants to save his friends and comrades to stay away or fight through it, but his fanciful determination will result either in miracle or collapse. His ability considers as a reset button to move forward through a solitary phenomenon for altering his fate and judgment; however, the price of it, such as others’ forgetfulness because of dimensional hopping and the restriction to expose his truth behind the curtain by himself, is intensely flawed — delivering the chance for an alternative resolution within the plot as if he acquitted himself for cleansing his own sins. <br />
<br />
Tappei did an outstanding job at applying the Law of Equivalent Exchange to his ability, especially his weak physicality — making it a simple yet intense thrill to catch the audience away from its boredom of perfection. The suspense is masterful and consistent based on every context, which makes Re:Zero intriguing to let more fans craft more theories and questions as a layer of curious engagement. Moreover, his character means to be morally gray as he doesn’t look at the other side easily, which means he can be once a foolish and casual person like us to aggress somebody to those who might threaten him or not. He has his own priority, flaws, pride, ways of resolve, and love for Emilia as his “knight in shining armor” personality drives him to be whoever he is. He can cry as a wimpy bastard or a try-hard hero of himself, but his determination grasps it ever since he had been gradually developing by chasing his grit even further with alternative resolution. Through his behavioral process, he manages to stay casual without forcing himself to be an uninvited guest in front of a pillar of society. That’s what makes Subaru a human person and a true knight — not his own heroic and fanciful delusions which most people like Ram, Priscilla, and Julius despised him for his amateur overconfidence by his self-importance back from the prequel of this anime adaptation. <br />
<br />
He manages his personality to be uptight and miserable; however, Rem volunteers to be as one whom Subaru will vent out his drastic feeling that flows within him as the time of Episode 18 snaps him out despite resulting in an expected rejection. His vulnerability strikes him to grasp his confidence, but his lack of self-esteem asserts the reason for his failure. For now, he frequently realizes that the world itself doesn’t fulfill his fanciful wishes to become reality at all, which fate matters based on the context he made in the first place. It only works if the ethical standard has been met, and then Subaru will come for the rest. Hence, he is a well-written character. He consistently had gone through the process of Dunning-Kruger effect in a psychological sense based on his character from the midway of Season 1, and right now, we’re still looking forward to its next level…. I mean, this second season. <br />
<br />
From the reference of Dunning-Kruger effect to the extent of Subaru’s Peak of Stupidity till his Valley of Despair in the first season, the second season projects more about his Slope of Enlightenment through the Trial of Sanctuary by Echidna’s lost soul. It tackles more about the diversity of its gloomy atmosphere. The mechanism of reality with unawareness of difference is crucially perilous. Without facing it, there will be no point to gain the courage against others with dreadful courage and competence. <br />
<br />
Compared to most isekai series, Re:Zero subverts the common trope into its substantial value for achieving the unique message and formulating the setting to an authentic extent. The overarching plot has been connected, and the premise of this series becomes more lucid. Most characters are compelling to provide their own ideals based on the contextual background, and there are little to no nonsensical tropes to be presented in a big picture. <br />
<br />
There are also new characters being set up to their motive, creating its thickness of plot development, and some side characters are well-reserved for their own plot progression. Most of them aren’t just here to boost Subaru’s morale, they usually have their own priority which provides the importance of their livelihood as the role of themselves and society. Sometimes can be friendly, and sometimes can be contradictory. The “power of friendship” trope is well done with proper foundation of each other’s relationship as if most students are sometimes doubting each other for some tentative reasons. They have their own stories which affect how they have been nurtured ever since behind Subaru’s back, making them relevant in most cases. With proper consistency, it is understandable for audiences to pique their curiosity and craft more hypotheses based on the observation throughout every significant scene. <br />
<br />
The slow pacing of this season did a great job of building up more worldbuilding, character interaction, and lore for serving the premise to its promising level as the plot thickens further with multiple ways to ensure and stabilize the core theme of the story into a complex understanding of every fundamentals in a gradual manner; however there are some scenes that are rushed yet sensible to assert its foundation.<br />
 <br />
The story is written in Third-Limited narrative style, which Subaru always owns the spotlight of Re: Zero’s main storyline, and the narrative standpoint matches it up to deliver both contextual factors of shock and suspense. The plot follows in dimensional-hopping theory which most audiences think this is a time-travelling series; hence, it laughs me off whenever I mostly hear of its misconceptions. It fleshes out the message of the story and the concept of Subaru’s purpose and development for living in another world, especially Episode 4, which it also fills the space for making its premise to be more purposeful and adds the mystery or any substantial details on why Subaru was sent to this world to begin with. It also molds Subaru’s self-reflection during the time in his original world for projecting more leniency and understanding about his own character. The poignancy within Season 2 encapsulates and expands all the underlying feelings Subaru had before.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of minor details that have foreshadowed for the future occurrence within a big picture, and there will be more twists to come if you pay close attention to every little detail. These perceptible details throughout the series significantly matter the most for the plot progression to be understandable, and connecting each plot point with sensible pictures is worth engaging to liven the audiences up in a mindblowing extent. Moreover, the story puts so many obstacles and chilling aura as Subaru will face against the odds for his objective to pass the trial and deactivate the barrier of the Sanctuary. <br />
<br />
As a LN reader, I really hope this Arc 4 will give a proper and consistent adaptation since this is the best arc among the rest, and it did; however, there are some slight chances which disappoints me for a bit. Particularly, the animation quality and cut contents clouds me to clench my fist for a while; however, I don’t care about it since I’m all up for this beautiful and eerie story of a psychological drama and thrill in a visual manner because the rollercoaster is on the way. It also reminds me that they might cut some LN contents to avoid an excessive level of exposition dumps, and instead the anime adaptation prioritizes more into “Show, don’t tell” rule… or in other cases, “Show and tell” rule. <br />
<br />
There are also some episodes with dialogue-heavy standards, but it is essential and relevant to its case for building up more consistency and adding the layers of intensity and progression with more directional questions as the anime provides more exploration with subtle explanation. <br />
<br />
I wonder if some people say that the dialogues within Re:Zero are “systematically” jarring, then I totally disagree. First of all, dialogues are the key element to establish the characterization which provides what and how the characters are sharing and communicating in a way to create the social understanding between each other. If we say that the conversation is kinda “boring”, then have you tried chatting with others in serious times or listening to other people’s serious chat?<br />
<br />
If we often ignore the conversation from other people, then it doesn’t build up the social exposure to the point that we have to understand each other’s perception. That’s also the similar case to how Re:Zero achieved its dialogue system. It is systematically consistent to the point that every character has to articulate before it will become otherwise. Whether in hypothetical or moral sense, every human being is an inconsistent creature with limited thought process and biased morality/ideology, and with distinctions, there’s a serving purpose of your need to communicate. That’s why you need something to vent out your thoughts and feelings. <br />
<br />
If some audiences have reacted with their thoughts about the dialogue being “jarring, then that’s just a matter of your first subjective impression through how communication works. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the orchestral music hits the thespian or gloomy vibes with a phenomenal melody which enthralls more transverse atmosphere as it pleases our ears to render its theme with consistency. The symbolizing beats are presented well with contextual deliverance. It signals perfectly to every character’s tone as it builds up more aura and meaningfulness around them. Each scene comprises its suitable meaning, which it brings more vigor to express the stimulation between fear and courage. However, I despise that they mostly haven’t provided the time for opening and ending song to present within every episode, yet it also exchanges with more lengthy minutes to catch up the writing size into an essential and almost absolute extent for recognizing the plot progression into a comprehensible standard. Length-wise, it is appreciative to offer each episode with significant impact by providing more projection to adapt. <br />
<br />
In regards to the character section, please be aware of spoilers because I might go detailed for this. <br />
<br />
**WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT**<br />
<br />
At first, Frederica is introduced to be a new… or rather a recurring maid, as she formerly served Roswaal before the time of Ram’s duty. Her gentle personality has shown and explained about her professional experience of being Roswaal’s former and latter maid, so it suits her to be a person with decent help as a maid herself. Since there is an effect to forget someone’s existence, it also affects Roswaal to hire two maids, especially Petra. She also establishes a significance about her own character as she trains Petra to be a proper maid and also swear herself by the letter that she only got in her own hands as a hidden background about her — which we will get to know more about her later in the second cour. The twist of events is clear and connected between Rem’s occurrence and the purpose of their introduction; hence, it’s understandable.<br />
<br />
However, one problem in dialogue-wise, for example, is Petra’s inappropriate response which triggers something abrupt to progress the story in a silly way. Whenever I see her, I always cringe when she often baffles me and other compelling characters with awkward moments throughout every scene; nevertheless, I don’t hate her since she is a kid with potential. <br />
<br />
There is also another new character being introduced with relation to Frederica called Garfiel. Compared to Frederica, his older sibling, Garfiel appears to be a barbarous yet friendly character with strong finesse to begin with. At first, he remains intact and rational to the fact that he slightly cares for other people, especially Arlam Refugees, to have their sojourn. However, because of many loops from Subaru’s deeds, he alters his behavior to assault Subaru (and his other supporters/Arlam Refugees) because he senses an outgrown miasma throughout Subaru’s aura — dictating that he will protect the Sanctuary at all cost. He surely has his own deeds and priority with Ryuzu Shima’s help to establish his significance as a side character who will put himself as an obstacle against Subaru’s odds, making himself relevant to this case. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Otto has the support for Subaru, Emilia, and the rest of Arlam Refugees. He has the role to provide them with transportation, but it’s not just for that. He also has more responsibility to build more wholesome interaction with Subaru and Garfiel, ensuring himself that he will be in a great place for them — especially Otto saves and impresses Subaru with his timid humor and personality. However, Otto’s wholesome development has been wasted and paid by Subaru’s death loops to alter his destiny for a greater cause, but it doesn’t mean for him to be just a neglected accessory to Subaru’s eyes since Subaru himself wants to hide his burden and lift it up by himself. For now, he has a good potential to be a prominent character, and I hope the second cour will give him more screentime to showcase his significant greatness by helping Subaru out and determining himself to develop out of his comfort zone of timidity.<br />
<br />
Roswaal has revealed his importance and plot progression for serving his purpose with the Gospel which also has it with Beatrice, uncovering their agency behind them. Surely, they have a long-time relationship between both of them since they have been residing within the mansion for a long time, and the context makes sense as it is according to the plan. Beatrice, however, has some share of problems with Subaru about her supposed role which clouds her from being isolated. How she conveys her emotional confrontation with Subaru grasps her outstanding chance to vent out her feeling of solitude within her own comfort zone, conserving it to build up more layers about her for the potential development. Beatrice also represents herself as a hermit which makes her an intriguing and realistic symbol of an isolated persona. Similar to Otto’s case of development, she can be a suitable candidate for that as well — looking forward to getting out of her comfort zone. <br />
<br />
Echidna is also introduced as the Witch of Greed and a transcendental character by letting Subaru enter the Castle of Dreams. Her cold yet charm-provoking personality shines her gloomy aura to be a likeable and knowledgeable character as if she perceives logic through emotions just as she provides Subaru to confront his own past through his memories for his self-reflection. Her mild support to Subaru by his reminiscence helps the audience to know more about his character and build up a connection between the fantasy and the reality, which makes Episode 4 so special to our own eyes.  However, Echidna knows her own goal behind Subaru’s back and stabs it as she teases his intuition with her plan. Her sham and manipulative exaggeration hits the bullseye towards Subaru’s heart which surprises me by her deceiving plan, as her black-hearted aura impresses me more. Her greed and love for knowledge is intelligible. Her sense of hatred and dark humor conveys well, and we’ll see more about it. Thus, I really love her pride and competence of being the Witch of Greed which gives an impact of her neutral strength. Hence, she’s my favorite character.<br />
<br />
The rest of Witches have their unique characteristic based on their respective symbols. However, one of them doesn’t properly present their substance, such as Minerva’s obnoxious personality, and yet the charm of it is still there. The message delivers well to show how Subaru is judged by his own flawed nature and deeds, especially Typhon who projects Subaru’s sin within the depth of his inner core as being a “good” guy doesn’t mean to be truly a sinner. Each of their metaphors are simply considerable with their perceptible charm. Furthermore, we get to know more about Satella who isn’t entirely a “villain” character whom we thought to be, and her self-conflict is a minor point to recognize the value behind something we can’t see more about her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Elsa has reappeared once again to achieve her goal by putting herself before Subaru and his friends as their obstacle, making herself as a well-reserved antagonist. From the prequel, we can understand that her goal failed to achieve Emilia’s badge as she retreated from Reinhard’s abrupt help; however, this second season made a reservation for her to reveal her Plan B in a hidden manner. We really don’t know her motives behind the curtain yet, but the second cour will open the curtain for more explanation in a suitable time. Meili Potroute is also reintroduced as a hostile character alongside Elsa, and a minor detail from Season 1 makes a plot twist understandable when you pay close attention to it. Her introduction in scene-wise, however, feels boring yet equitable to play her own part. <br />
<br />
It’s grueling for Subaru to learn from his mistakes and face against the odds as he needs a harsh and gradual realization for his endurance against his obstacles before his eyes. “I know hell” is what creates his words for him to act, and that “hell” is a laudable metaphor to describe his clasp of strength for shouldering the burden and moving forward despite its vicious outcome. The heavy impact throughout his experiences is understandable, which in return, most audiences can connect their empathy with Subaru — conveying more concerns regarding his own concerns. He has a lot of aims to set and stand by himself up for persevering through many ways to alter his fate against itself. He plays the puzzles in which one or multiple moves will tear him down into pieces if he stumbles on the wrong floor, welcoming him to the pit of despair. If not, then there will be a light of hope awaiting towards the end of Sanctuary. Because in the end, the only way for Subaru to fix the situation is to fix himself.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Emilia will also face the trial by facing her tragic past that is still behind the curtains yet. For this season, we finally see her worthwhile flaw from being a “perfect” girl. Its twisted helplessness cripples her pragmatic mind in a discordant extent from bearing what comes before her as if she has been taking a lot of Math exams and being overly preoccupied by her restless yet twisted cloud of effort. Her uncontrolled state gives the impact to pull her away from blind of kindness. <br />
<br />
There is no world where we can escape that loneliness without changing the core. <br />
<br />
***SPOILERS END***<br />
<br />
In regards to animation, there are some episodes, especially Episode 6 and 12, which have rigid proportions and movements as if some animators have a hard time rendering the sketches due to some bit of miscommunication amid the quarantine period. This is one of a problematic category which slightly baffles me to enjoy less than the quality in Season 1. Some erroneous frames and CGI renditions can be noticeable for most audiences to identify its upsetting quality. Whenever I rewatch these scenes, I’d rather grab my dumbbells and do the squats to sweat out my frustration, and I’m not also the type who will just cross my eyes and say “Fine!”. Nonetheless, it’s still fine if the adaptation is faithfully well-done which it is truly as it is. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime adaptation has exceptional results to capture its aesthetic value to a further extent. As Season 1 delivers some weak conclusions within the second half, the first cour of Season 2 provides a high slope of twist to let the audience rise for an engaging rollercoaster ride. Oh, boy! It punches right through the feels with sensible foundation as this show serves like a dark chocolate with 25% of sweetness. The worldbuilding here is excellent as it builds up more atmosphere into a thematic balance between light and dark. Re: Zero is packed with epitome of suffering, perseverance for truth and doubts, horror of loneliness, and substantial depth of self-reflection through the mastery of melodrama with contextual deliverance. Forcing Subaru to confront the consequences of his many deaths is a masterstroke for the series, even before you consider the terrifying and heart wrenching way in which it was delivered. While Re:Zero is great at genuine horror and gore, it is in the psychological terror that this show truly shines. I can safely say that it deserves more acclaim because this season fills up more layers from what it lacks in Season 1, and it has fulfilled the promise. All I do right now is to sit back and relax to enjoy my smiles and frowns while connecting myself through its excellent narration with indulgence of an outstanding cliffhanger. If there will be a single teaser for Season 3 adaptation, I will moan and cry for it. Hence, it’s my all-time favorite anime. This show is highly recommendable if you already have watched Season 1. <br />
<br />
As the first cour offers more questions, will the second cour answer them?<br />

    I just finished watching the 4th episode of the Second Season, and I already watched the Director&#039;s Cut before it, and this my review:<br />
<br />
Great and a promising start for Rezero in all aspects, the drawing and effects were good, the Music was amazing probably it will be even better later, the story is great as always not like other isekai anime when the mc is overpowered ( well we all know about this since season one ), or when the mc become overpowered after struggling and training too much, No this is exactly the opposite, its a sad and hard journey full of continuing pain

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350422">
        both mental and physical for the mc, and this is what I like about this anime, not the other isekai anime which are full of cliche moments, anyways this season probably won&#039;t be different from the first I think it will be a replica of what happened, poor Subaru he will have to suffer again and again to fulfill his dreams, Hopefully, it ill continue like this with the addition of the new characters I think this anime will be in the top 3 list anime for this season in mal without a doubt.

    Here is my early review of RE: Zero, and if it lives up to it&#039;s previous season!<br />
<br />
It certainly does! It really picks up where we left off, and continues as if it was more than a one season show, which is great to see from an adored show. You won&#039;t go wrong with picking up season two, as we&#039;re in for treat, and you&#039;ll be glad to pick it up and continue it&#039;s story!<br />
<br />
The tone is what you would expect from this show, the art and the sound matching the themes of the show in general, being that they look great, but also match the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350388">
        current plotline within the show. Another plus for the anime in general, really well done there. Another point in the art is that in some places, it really looks stunning.<br />
<br />
As for characters? While the ones you already know are what you would expect of them, some new faces that have come so far are just as fun and entertaining as the cast from the first season. Every one of them feels unique and not out of place at all. Without any of them feeling out of place, or being straight up annoying in their characterization. They really push this new arc along really well, and bring good plot progression with who they are.<br />
<br />
All in all, is season two looking as good as season one? You damn sure it is.

    If the 1st season of Re:Zero was no masterpiece (but it was still damn entertaining) for you, then enjoy the 2nd season - the better contender for Anime of The Year title. You’re not ready, are you? I am not.<br />
<br />
*This review is subject to change from natural causes. It is written by a man who read the source material. Also, this review has not major spoilers, you can read safely before seeing the first episode.*<br />
<br />
The first thing you have to know - it’s Re:Zero. That’s right. RE:ZERO. There’s no REM:zero. What I mean, if you’re watching this series only for one particular character, in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350386">
        case - Rem, you should drop the series right now. Enjoy your casual stuff and have fun. Of course, there’s nothing wrong in loving Rem. I love Rem! She’s sweetheart. However, this series is not about her. She’s not the only one lovable and important character in the series. You have two options: Understand it, or not. There’s a lot of people who choose the second path understating the overall rating by their ‘1’ score. Their loss. They will miss the great show.<br />
<br />
For some people, the 1st season had no plot, central themes or objectives. There were three arcs, independent of each other, when the main character suffered. It has been called a suffer porn. Deviating from if it is right to think about it or not... If you’re one of these people, don’t worry, the 2nd season approaches. This time you’ll clearly see the main motivation for Subaru to go through an unknown world. The season adapts only one long arc, which shows us what’s standing behind Emilia Camp.<br />
<br />
The 4th arc is considered by the readers to be the best arc in the series so far. 25 episodes for one, single arc. That’s good news, as there will be a more attention to maintain the details. It’s also a split-cour season, which means the diligence is going to be even bigger. There are no place for slothful moves.<br />
<br />
It’s silly to say, that this season have for sure: wonderful arts; great animation or banger OSTs. I mean, not all episodes have been released by now while you’re reading it. I can’t write it until I watch all the episodes, it would be stupid and undermine the sense of this “review”. Although, I can say with confidence that after seeing all these PVs and all these released episodes so far - this season has got it. Character designs are changed by comparing them to these from the first season, but it’s a change for the better. Animation is at good level, the same as before. And sound effects chosen by White Fox are at the top-tier as always. And remember - All of this has been created four years after the release of first season, in times of pandemic, thereby season has been split-coured.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero is NOT a generic isekai. It’s something more in terms of this. It’s a well developed story with amazing characters. The fantasy with no bigger plot holes. It’s just a really long story and to know all the answers, you have to wait. The episode 18th of the previous season showed us clearly, that until then, you have watched the PROLOGUE of the show.<br />
<br />
It’s understandable that you may not like this title. Everyone has their own tastes and opinions. However, saying that Re:Zero is flat, generic, emotionless anime, where the side characters are empty, one-dimensional, not developed at all and they’re never asking for consent... - Sorry, but you just haven’t watched the series. You just skipped it. The show were playing in the background when you were not interested in watching and understanding what’s going on. I may not like a concept of the way how the author resolves many problems, I may not like a few characters, I may have a lot of complains… But it won’t change the fact, that this title has realistic, unpredictable characters who acts like real people, despite of being in fantasy world. The fact, that this show is not like the others. It’s too deep to looks like that. <br />
<br />
White Fox can boast of producing the two top-shelf titles. Steins;Gate and Re:Zero, which receives the first second season at the hands of this studio. We have nothing left than enjoying this show together! From square one… No. From zero.

    The term &quot;peak fiction&quot; often gets thrown around and has somewhat lost its meaning these days. Peak fiction, for me, is something that exemplifies masterful storytelling, world building and well written characters. The best of the best. The zenith of storytelling. Only a few series I&#039;ve ever read/seen have reached those heights. Re:Zero is one of them and is in indeed, peak fiction.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer, I am a Light Novel reader and Re:Zero is one of my favourite book series of all time. For that reason, I had a proverbial magnifying glass out when watching S2 cour 1. Looking for any type of adaptation, animation and artistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358349">
        errors. I genuinely found none. This first cour was one of the best adaptations I&#039;ve ever seen of a Light Novel and you can tell it was crafted with love and by fans of the series. <br />
<br />
The pacing and cinematography are done so well that it&#039;s apparent the staff fully understood the message of the 3 volumes adapted this cour and did an amazing job of translating it into the anime. Other than the second trial in episode 12, I can&#039;t really think of anything that was omitted or cut. <br />
White Fox continue to impress me as a studio. From Steins;Gate to Re:Zero they have consistently put out heat and it&#039;s great to see. <br />
<br />
Narratively, this season really starts the story of Re:Zero. Think of everything you saw in the first season as an appetiser of sorts for what we got in this cour and what&#039;s to come. The world and characters are so rich that you just get sucked in and want to uncover all of its mysteries. Speaking of getting sucked in, one really cool artistic choice that i enjoyed from this season was the omission of the OP and or ED on most episodes. White Fox prioritised storytelling over the intro and outro which allowed for much smoother transitions between episodes than most shows have. A minor thing that goes a long way for me.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Re:Zero S2 first cour was one of the best LN adaptations I have ever seen and did an amazing job of laying the foundation for what&#039;s to come in the story. It&#039;s a fun, wild, painful and beautiful ride that will leave you wanting more and more. Scariest thing is, we&#039;re just getting started. <br />

    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Has it really been over 4 years? Time sure flies fast and we’re in 2020, blessed with another infamous season of ReZero. Yes, I said ‘infamous’ because this isekai throws rules out the window. ReZero Season 2 makes its long awaited return for the Summer 2020 season after the inital delay. And what’s more? We haven’t even reached endgame yet. This is just part one of a long saga following Subaru and his despairing adventures.<br />
<br />
Coming into the season took me some bits of time to digest. I’m not going to lie, watching the second season since the break felt almost surreal at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358344">
        first. Since defeating the White Whale and Petelgeuse, he’s been traveling with Emilia. Everything seemed normal at first but we quickly learn a revelation in their timeline. Rem’s existence seems to have been forgotten by almost everyone except Subaru while Crusch seemingly also lost her memories. With such an opening episode, you can imagine the ride the audience will be in for. Furthermore, we are introduced to the Witch of Greed, Echidna, a mysterious individual with major importance this season. <br />
<br />
Who is Echidna? To put it simply, she is the character Subaru meets after opening the Sanctuary. With a cunning smile and intimidating presence, she invites Subaru to a tea party in some dimensional pocket space. It’s the kind of trickery this show pulls on its audience, by introducing mysterious characters and make us form countless speculations about them. Still, we have to keep an eye on Subaru as his adventure takes him to one world he didn’t imagine before: Japan. In episode 4, we are introduced to Subaru’s former home Japan where we also learn more about his parents. It’s an interesting concept added to this season because we didn’t learn much about Subaru’s family before. Furthermore, Subaru has to embrace the fact that he cannot return to his former life anymore. He is now part of something much bigger.<br />
<br />
From the first half part of the season, I must say that ReZero Season 2 isn’t shy to open the physical and psychological scars the show had before. From what we’ve seen, Subaru’s suicide attempt from early on shows how desperate he is to go back in time to save Rem. Of course, his plan doesn’t work and instead, he has to settle with another solution. That triggers the meeting with Echidna, who proves to be a dangerous individual, but different from many of the other character he has encountered. In fact, Subaru’s encounter with both old and new characters this season is perhaps some of his most memorable experiences. Among the returning character roster includes Beatrice and Elsa. That’s right, I just said Elsa. Hearing that name time should trigger some tragic memories for Subaru and she’s not here to play around. She still retains her killing instincts and it doesn’t take long for her to make a move. It seems the season adds more and more problems for Subaru to overcome but at the same time, he also makes some unlikely allies. Among them includes Otto Suwen, who risked his life to save him, and also considers him as a friend. Furthermore, Subaru’s unlikely alliance with the Sanctuary guardian Garfiel adds more firepower to the team. And if that wasn’t enough, how about a badass maid who can transform into a fierce beast? Meet Frederica, the older sister of Garfiel. With her beast abilities, you can bet that blood will be spilled in her presence. Honestly, having these allies gives Subaru’s a glimpse of light in his dark world. Maybe this season isn’t just a despair fest for him after all.<br />
<br />
Like the previous season, Subaru’s relationship with Emilia still remains important. Their tender moments shows trust and loyalty as the two work together to make the world right. Even if Emilia can’t remember Rem, she still wants to help him and seeks the truth. The truth may seem almost impossible to reach with Subaru encountering problems from every corner. In one of the later episodes, we’re introduced to other witches representing the seven deadly sins including wrath, gluttony, and pride. If there’s anything to learn by, it’s that you should never judge a book by its cover in ReZero. <br />
<br />
Watching ReZero Season 2 also shown me that the character Satella is merciless in her personal quest involving Subaru. Her shadow abilities is only a testament of her power but it’s the mind games she plays against others that truly shows her malevolence. If you don’t believe me, just ask Subaru when gets tormented by memories and having the words “I love you” repeated endlessly at his face. However at this point in the story, Subaru knows how to face despair and isn’t afraid to take risks like committing suicide. Remember, death is only just the beginning and possibly a salvation for others. An example this season is Beatrice as we hear her despair and reason to die. But as always, Subaru wants to be the person to resolve her problems. He’s the problem solver and thanks to his Reset ability, he can make the impossible, possible. If you’ve been watching ReZero from the start, you can tell how persistent Subaru is and the monumental risks he takes. He’s fought against fate, cheated death, and now is fighting against the unimaginable. Welcome to ReZero Season 2 where anything, and I mean, literally anything can happen.<br />
<br />
White Fox’s return to the sequel still carries their talent of animation despite the four year break. Have no fear as this season doesn’t suffer from any animation quality. We are still treated with the light novel-animated style of the character designs with an elegant world. And of course, there’s gruesome scenes with blood. I hope you don’t have a fear of rabbits because there’s going to be some gore feast. Character designs for the new witches are also decorated with fashion and aesthetics unique to each character. I think at the end of the day, it’s safe to say that ReZero Season 2 is in the right hands.<br />
<br />
Regardless how long it’s been, watching this season felt like exploring the deeper and emotional journey of a young man fighting to make a change. This has been a journey that chronicles the despair but also hope during the darkest of hours. In essence, Subaru represents a selfless protagonist that challenges the limits of impossibility. And there’s more to come! As this is only part one of season 2, prepare for another saga in this fantasy thriller.

Story- 10/10<br />
                   It&#039;s an isekai type anime. So definitely the story has to be good for people to take interest in it. Basically 2nd season is continuing just after the last episode season-1 without wasting time. That&#039;s a good thing tho. Many people were waiting to know the past of our MC and now we are going to see that in this season. Also he has to save Rem which cannot be done just by dying and going to past since the save point is where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350376">
        Rem is already dead. So overall story is going forward at a good rate.<br />
<br />
Art- 9/10 <br />
             I think the animation quality somewhat drop from what it was in the 1st season but it&#039;s still good. There&#039;s no problem with art.<br />
<br />
Sound- 10/10<br />
                   Sound is as good as in the first season or maybe even better. I normally skip the OP/ED of anime but i am enjoying this one.<br />
<br />
Character- 10/10 <br />
                      This is the part why so many people enjoy this. The character designs in this anime are very good. There are many characters about which we don&#039;t know much but slowly gets hints about them and then we try our own theories to guess about them. This makes this anime more enjoyable. Some new characters are introduced so far in 2nd season like Echidna, Garfiel, Frederica etc. which are also good. I am personally curious to know more about Emilia, Beatrice and Puck. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment- 10/10<br />
                        Enjoyment is 100/100. Since every aspect of this anime is great so it&#039;s definitely going to be enjoyable. <br />
<br />
Overall- 10/10<br />
                    <br />

Ah, after 4 long years, the long-awaited sequel to the 2016 isekai anime Re:ZERO ~ Starting Life in Another World has finally arrived much to the joy of anime fans and myself. The original season was one of the most popular anime of 2016. I’ll focus on not only how season 2 compares to the first season and how it improves upon the foundations laid by the first season, but also how it treats

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358371">
        the isekai genre as a whole.<br />
<br />
Re:ZERO is an isekai anime. It shares many tropes typical of the isekai genre by now. The first season came out in 2016 around the time the isekai anime trend started to boom in popularity. Now every season of every year seems to feature some sort of brand new isekai show. There&#039;s no doubt this recent &quot;success&quot; of isekai shows had some part to play in bringing back this beloved show. There are undoubtedly many people who are sick of seeing these new seasonal isekai shows, but this is not a brand new isekai anime of the season. It&#039;s a sequel to a pre-existing show from a few years back.<br />
<br />
Now with that out of the way, let&#039;s continue to the review. There will be no major spoilers of season 2 in this review.<br />
<br />
Plot/setting:<br />
Many isekai shows borrow a lot from other media like video games, especially from fantasy settings like Dragon Quest. This is very much the case with Re:ZERO, for the most part. But we all know that ideas don&#039;t mean a lot, it&#039;s the execution that matters. Unlike most isekai shows nowadays which employ worlds that are very game-y with video game UI and leveling systems, Re:ZERO throws all that away and opts for a slightly more realistic fantasy setting. The world of Re:ZERO feels like a world inhabited by people as opposed to NPCs. There are no in-game UI or level-up system. Instead, the only level up we get is the emotional development of the characters who inhabit this world. <br />
If you&#039;ve watched the recently released Director&#039;s Cut of the first season (which is missing from MAL&#039;s database for some reason) then you already got a sneak-peek into the beginning of 2nd season. If you haven&#039;t then don&#039;t fret, the extra post-credits scene of the DC ver. which sets up the 2nd season is included in the first episode. So basically the 2nd season starts off immediately after the 1st season. After 4 whole setup episodes, the fourth arc of Re:ZERO finally kicks off. And it finally covered some important story beats of the first season and also solved many &quot;plotholes&quot;. The show takes a very slow and promising approach in telling one of the best arcs of Re:ZERO from the novels.<br />
The story of Re:ZERO is continuous. Rarely does it leave you with any room to breathe. Every moment is tense and action-packed. No moments are wasted because all of it is central to plot progression in one way or another. Season 2 is only halfway done. Part 2 aka the actual meat of the season has been delayed to January. Some novel readers might even say the whole of Part 1 was just a setup for what comes after aka Part 2. Does that mean it’s not worth experiencing the first half of the story until the second half arrives? Absolutely not. Part 1 has its own stories to tell. Part 1 of Season 2 has some of the best loops in Re:ZERO history. Each loop has a mystery surrounding them which gets unveiled one after another in a very unpredictable manner. If you never read the novels and watch purely the anime, without spoiling too much, I’ll just say that you’re in for lots of surprises that drop like bombshells. Many of which are unanswered questions from season 1.<br />
<br />
Art/animation: <br />
I’m one of the few people who thought the anime art style of Re:ZERO season 1 didn’t match the quality of the light novel illustrations. They’re very close but they don’t quite nail the beauty seen in the ln illustrations except in a handful of places where the anime can outshine the ln illustrations by Shinichiro Ootsuka. He makes great art that’s difficult to emulate in animation. Season 2 art style is very faithful to the 1st season. However, I think the art style of season 2 is slightly more true to the light novel illustrations. <br />
The art of the world itself looks like a pretty generic fantasy setting. But the character design of the main and brand new characters is amazingly drawn and memorable. They don&#039;t seem out of place in any way except for, of course, the main character who is literally out of this world. This is more from the first season but his design does a good job standing out in the environment as an anomaly for that world.<br />
I don&#039;t really watch Re:ZERO for its animation or fight scenes. This show isn&#039;t about that. And it&#039;s definitely not about an overpowered MC destroying enemies like in a typical isekai power fantasy. There are a few well-done scenes that are handled amazingly in this part of the season. <br />
Now here comes a fun fact, every episode after episode 5 was drawn from home by the White Fox staff because of COVID-19. Season 2 was originally supposed to air in April right after where the Director’s cut of season 1 left off. And I believe at the time the splitting of cours wasn’t yet announced. They were delayed because of the inevitable. I’m happy to confirm that each episode after episode 5 was still handled well. There were some scenes with awkwardly drawn frames but nothing that breaks the immersion too much. I have faith that these few frames will get fixed in the Blu-ray release or maybe a Director’s cut version of season 2?<br />
And oh boy, despite the limitations White Fox managed to deliver oversized episodes. Most episodes were over 26 minutes long. And that’s WITHOUT the openings or endings included. Episode 4, which was one of the most important and memorable episodes of the entirety of Re:ZERO might just go down as one of the best single anime episodes of the year. The amount of emotion poured into that episode, and what comes after that are surreal. White Fox are masters at creating tense situations from the source material they adapt even more intense. One of my personal favorite shows of all time is Steins;Gate from the last decade. If White Fox can keep up the quality that they’re producing today, then Re:ZERO might just become their highlight show of this decade. And that’s saying a lot, since Steins;Gate is one of the best modern classics ever produced.<br />
<br />
Sound/music: <br />
Music has always been good in Re:ZERO. If season 1 was about memorable music then season 2 is about fantastic sound design. Season 1 had some amazing atmospheric tracks but season 2 blows it out of the water! Animation of the season might’ve lagged behind a bit because of real-world circumstances but holy sh*t, did they somehow manage to surpass their sound quality from 4 years ago! Important scenes are paired with music that makes them feel more intense. Scenes with mystery and revelations are also accompanied by appropriate tracks. Sadly some fan-favorite tracks like “Call of the Witch” are missing here. But I think some of the newer tracks more than make up for that by creating a moody atmosphere not present in the original. Trust me, watch this season with a pair of good quality headphones. You owe it to yourself!<br />
The opening of season 2 is absolutely phenomenal. The song performed by Suzuki Konomi is incredible and the animation that goes along with it is a significant step up from season 1&#039;s first 2 OPs. This is one of those hard to skip openings of the season. Just for the fantastic OP, I&#039;ll give this an extra point.<br />
The 1st ED to season 1 is memorable. Luckily we got a new ED that&#039;s amazing in not just presentation but also sounds the best out of the 3 ED there are. I don’t think it’s better than “Stay Alive” performed by Rie Takahashi (aka Emilia) but it still stands on its own and fits the theme of season 2 quite nicely. <br />
But unfortunately, as was the case with most the 1st season episodes there are more episodes without any OPs OR EDs than there are episodes with them. In fact, I only saw 2 episodes that included the OP, and a few more of them included the ED, but not the visuals. <br />
You know the opening and ending are good when you complain about the show skipping them for you and focusing more on the plot.<br />
The voice actors/actresses do an amazing job. Especially Echidna voiced by none other than industry veteran Maya Sakamoto. Her casting is perfect for the job since Echidna is one of the most important characters of season 2 and boy does she deliver.<br />
And speaking of characters…<br />
<br />
Characters: <br />
This is going to be my personal favorite part of this review. I&#039;ve always considered the heart of an isekai series to be the characters. Most isekai shows sacrifice story and world-building just to make fun characters. Many isekai shows with fantasy setting borrow your standard Dragon Quest-inspired worlds with a very generic plot like &quot;slay the Demon Lord&quot; or something like that and rely mostly on the characters to be an entertaining show. I wouldn&#039;t say the same is true for Re:ZERO, at least not completely. The world of Re:ZERO is fairly competent and will only keep getting better as more chapters are written. But it&#039;s the characters living in that world who are the highlights. And sure enough, the newly introduced characters in the 2nd season are fantastic, especially Echidna, who not only stands on her own as a beloved character but also furthers the lore of the series. She became the much-needed face of Re:ZERO after the fall of the blue-haired demon maid at the start of the season whose name I can&#039;t quite remember. At least for this season, Echidna is going to be the poster girl, not Emilia, and definitely not that ill-fated blue imouto (sorry). Echidna isn’t the only new character introduced into this season. But she sure stole the spotlight (and also stole many people’s hearts lol).<br />
Returning characters from the first season are still the same or went through drastic changes. Some are gone and may not appear in this season for plot-reasons. Characters such as Roswaal and Ram get some interesting development that sets them apart from their season 1 selves. And there are a few other characters returning from the first season who contribute a lot to the overarching narrative and stand out as more important than ever before. I won’t spoil whom I’m talking about.<br />
I wanted to dedicate a separate para for the main character.<br />
Subaru Natsuki must be one of the most overhated and misunderstood MCs of any anime in recent years. Not just because of the bandwagon haters for his rejection of Rem (which I find dumb) but because of his incompetence as a protagonist. The latter of which is totally understandable in the case of season 1. Lots of people judged him from the basis of 1 season which was an incomplete story. But Season 2 gives him an opportunity to grow past his past mistakes and become a genuinely likable character. If you&#039;ve watched till episode 4 then you know what I&#039;m talking about. <br />
The Subaru you saw in season 1 is not the definitive version of himself. And neither is the version in season 2. He’s a character who’ll continue growing as the story progresses. In many ways, Re:ZERO is like a character study of Subaru. An average guy from our world facing impossible scenarios in a different world. One of the best ways to force his growth has to be the trials of the sanctuary, which is an ingenious plot setup.<br />
The most disappointing character of this part of the season however is Emilia. Who remains largely unchanged from season 1. Instead of her getting more developed like the rest of the cast, what we see are only her weaknesses. This was definitely not her season. I expect her to redeem herself in part 2, just like Subaru redeemed himself in this part. As for the blue-haired demon maid I was talking about aka Rem, well I never liked her as much as the masses did. I thought she was good in the first season but in this season she was turned into nothing more than a plot device. I think we do deserve a break from her and let the other characters receive the spotlight. And so far they delivered. I wholeheartedly believe we’ll be fine without her for a while.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
I&#039;m someone who very much enjoyed the 1st season and was patiently waiting for a sequel. Now that my prayer&#039;s been answered I enjoyed every moment of season 2. Each episode of Re:ZERO ends with cliffhangers. And the ending of this part leaves us with a 3-month long cliffhanger. I genuinely believe the cliffhangers make the experience even better. This is something you won’t be able to experience after a certain amount of time passes. But it is still enjoyable to binge the series. That’s how I watched season 1 anyway.<br />
If you are someone who didn&#039;t like the first season or were put off by it before even finishing it then I don&#039;t know why you would want to watch this, but if you have an open mind then this season has the potential of changing your opinion about Re:ZERO (or the isekai genre in general?).<br />
<br />
I know I treated Rem, one of the most important supporting characters of season 1, too harshly in the characters section. But if your enjoyment of Re:ZERO anime is dependent solely upon one waifu then I don’t think this season is for you. Better not to watch it than be disappointed. <br />
But people who watched Re:ZERO for what it was rather than for the waifubait, like myself, can’t wait to see what’s to come next.<br />
Part 2 of season 2 has will air in January of 2021. And you bet I’ll be keeping my eyes on that one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of my ratings from the preliminary review largely stand true in my final review.<br />

    Let me start by saying that I like Re:Zero, in fact, it&#039;s the only Isekai that I like, but this season has been a disappointment so far.<br />
<br />
Unless you have been living under a rock these past years, you probably have heard by part of the source material readers about how the good the arc this season covers is going to be, often called as the zenith of the writing quality of Re:Zero, however, I have yet to see anything worthy of that claim.<br />
<br />
One of the first thing you will notice when watching this new season it&#039;s how the production values has been decreased. Albeit the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350384">
        first season didn&#039;t have the most impressive animation, it did the job well enough to be called at least &quot;good&quot;. Sadly, I can&#039;t say the same for this season. It may be related by the fact that the place where I watch anime probably has the servers located in Tibet, but the general quality of the animation of this season so far has been far from good; Character design is less detailed compared to S1, and animation often feels stiff and dull. While isn&#039;t terribly bad making the show unwatchble, it&#039;s still a detriment to the general enjoyment.<br />
<br />
And speaking of production values, we have of to go to the Sound deparment, and how does it hold up? Not too well really. In fact, before writing this review I spent about ten minutes trying to recall a track from the show (in the end I got nothing). In other words, the soundtrack is in my opinion, very forgettable. I could swear that I haven&#039;t heard a single background track in these past episodes, and I wouldn&#039;t be lying! But if it&#039;s of any help, I also don&#039;t remember a single one from S1, so actually this one it&#039;s not a downgrade compared to S1(yay!). OP and the little I&#039;ve heard about the ED is fine, but I highly prefer the ones from S1, but that&#039;s just personal preference. The sound effects pass mostly unnoticed, so I (also) don&#039;t have a single remark here. And as for the voice acting, it&#039;s probably the best thing about this season and it&#039;s for me what is carrying the show alongside my attachment to it.<br />
<br />
Leaving the production values aside, let&#039;s go with the story. Or that&#039;s what I would like to say, but since all the episodes thus far have been setup, nothing of relevance has happened. This is of course not a bad thing, but it restricts me of saying something insightful at all (if I ever did, of course). That said, the direction is really off, with some melodrama and misplaced comedy here and there. And it doesn&#039;t help the fact that the first episode is actually what should have been the last episode of the first season, making the pacing even worse (this was done this way for commercial purposes, I guess)<br />
<br />
But now let&#039;s get with the arguably worst part of this season: Characters and dialogue (mostly the dialogue). I don&#039;t know what exactly happened to the dialogue, but for some reason it all feels so unnatural and amateurish. And the same could be said about the characters, they all feel cringey, especially their interactions. And this it&#039;s something that surprises me since I always liked all the characters, but now I can barely stand them (especially Subaru). This is something I don&#039;t remember having a problem with in the first season, but that could be explained by the fact that when I watched Re:Zero for the first time I barely had any experience with the medium, so now watching this after being a little more experienced, it just doesn&#039;t feel right. And of course, there hasn&#039;t been any major character development, but this is to be expected as only 4 episodes has been aired. <br />
<br />
So is this new season of Re:Zero bad? I certainly don&#039;t think so, but from what I&#039;ve seen so far it hasn&#039;t impressed me (in a good way at least). But in any case, most of these &quot;flaws&quot; are not fatal, so there is a chance that this season will improve over the first season(except for the animation which I doubt will improve). All that remains is to see and hope that this is going to be as good as its predecessor.

    Four years ago, Re:Zero took the world by storm with its fresh and innovative take on the isekai genre, and it rekindled my passion for the anime industry. Now in 2020, a year plagued with disaster and disappointment for many, it has returned with a much appreciated sequel. Amidst the cancellation and delay of a plethora of anime as well as the release of a slew of rather underwhelming others, it was refreshing to tune in to Re:Zero each week to follow its engaging narrative and compelling cast. <br />
<br />
Though there&#039;s one integral character that I just can&#039;t seem to REMember for some reason...ok no, I can&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358346">
        do it. It hurts to even attempt a &quot;Who&#039;s Rem?&quot; joke! First it was &quot;I love Emilia&quot; and now this. Author Tappei Nagatsuki really likes to shaft Rem, doesn&#039;t he?<br />
<br />
But seriously, Rem is a divisive character with both intense love and vigorous hate directed at her. However, you can&#039;t deny that her season one performance potentially left the biggest impact on viewers from the show and heightened Re:Zero&#039;s popularity overall. Therefore, I&#039;m sure I wasn&#039;t the sole anime-only watcher who was a little worried about how the quality of season two would turn out with Rem essentially written completely out of the picture. Thankfully, Nagatsuki elevated his game when it comes to writing, and combined with studio White Fox’s excellent directing choices, produced a sequel that unquestionably has to be a contender for anime of the year. <br />
<br />
This season, protagonist Natsuki Subaru must once again go face to face with a seemingly unconquerable dilemma where he must strive to find the perfect way to unlock the ideal outcome and live. Season two presents his greatest challenge yet, and all twelve episodes predominately take place within the same time loop. Now some may worry that this perspective constitutes a slow pace, especially when compared to the first season. And I agree, the first three episodes did feel a little sluggish, and I admittedly wanted the anime to pick up the pace. However, this approach ultimately works to the anime&#039;s advantage by allowing for the necessary development of mysteries, world building, character growth, and more. <br />
<br />
Similarly to the previous season, the anime doesn&#039;t get boring with each life despite Subaru constantly dying and resetting to the same location. The loops all showcase a variety of diverse scenarios and feature different characters that work together to slowly unravel the intriguing secrets concealed within the story. And each time that you think Subaru might just succeed, cruel reality strikes him down, reminding us all that being Subaru is suffering. Honestly though, there’s just so much to unpack here that I’m trying hard to restrain myself from writing a lengthy dissertation on it. Ultimately, it’s better to experience the specifics firsthand, and I can vouch that it’s worthwhile to take the time to examine the intricacies of this surprisingly deep and clever narrative. <br />
<br />
And that way I don’t have to write a painstakingly boring summary of it for you to read, so it’s a win-win for everyone!<br />
<br />
Speaking of clever, I just love how Studio White Fox actually extended the length of many episodes by several minutes as well as removed the opening and ending theme songs in multiple episodes to allow for more time to expand upon the plot. Great directing choice. I also appreciate how they respect the intelligence of viewers. They don’t spoon feed us info and actually let viewers think for themselves. The clues are out there, and it’s fun to piece together some obvious conclusions with the hints properly laid out for us. Of course Re:Zero is not free of info dumps. The tea parties between Subaru and Echidna, the Witch of Greed, can be lengthy and a little confusing at times. I still mostly liked such moments a good deal however. <br />
<br />
The biggest glow up this season in comparison to the last would have to be Subaru. His evolution as a character is subtle yet brilliant. Subaru&#039;s first trial provided valuable insight on his persona, while also tugging at my heart strings. Seriously, it was one of the best episodes of an anime that I’ve seen period. Why don’t other isekai try a similar concept of having the protagonist visit his original world? Also, his tea parties with Echidna highlighted his oddly trusting attitude and also his general narrow-mindedness in regards to multiple scenarios, exemplifying his prideful nature. What’s even more interesting is how Subaru is becoming more and more detached with each passing loop. As he becomes desensitized to his own life and those around him after constantly dying, he actually starts to walk down the path that both Roswaal and Echidna have taken and are clearly pushing him towards. Which can be summarized as focusing entirely on finding the perfect solution with a disregard for how to get there. Essentially meaning sacrifices are irrelevant, which completely contrasts Subaru’s heroic mentality. I respect the way that he’s been written, and Subaru has definitely grown on me as a protagonist. <br />
<br />
One of my few complaints about the first season was that while I believe Emilia is a decent character, I thought that she needed to accomplish more to convincingly earn her title as main girl and was entirely eclipsed by Rem in the second half of the first season. This time around however, she was provided with ample time to truly shine. <br />
<br />
And...she still didn&#039;t do too much.<br />
<br />
But you know what? That’s ok. While she spends the majority of this season failing to complete a trial, I learned through her interactions with Subaru that the two really are meant for each other. Yes, shipping SubaruXEmilia might be shocking to hear from a &quot;Remfag&quot; like myself, but their interactions this season convinced me that they need each other at this point. Emilia really is Subaru&#039;s light, his purpose. He often loses sight of this, but when he rediscovers what he’s fighting for, he changes for the better. Now this seemed entirely one sided in the first season, but when Emilia isn’t rejecting Subaru for Puck, you can tell how dependent she is on him. Especially when she has a, to avoid spoilers, let’s say Yandere mode under certain conditions. I look forward to the continued development of their relationship. <br />
<br />
The colorful cast of supporting characters upgraded from being a simply quirky bunch to actually having some personality and motivation. Village girl Petra and magical loli Beatrice each got moments in the spotlight. Roswaal was clearly set up to be a suspicious individual surrounded by intrigue, and the eventual revelation of a portion of his scheme was satisfying. Heck, even Otto of all people had a great bro moment with Subaru. And Ram…is cool. Though obviously, this group still has some flaws. For one thing, I thought Beatrice’s whole fervent ordeal sorta came out of left field considering where she seemed to be at emotionally in season one. They’re still a really solid supporting cast in my eyes nonetheless. <br />
<br />
There’s also an assortment of new characters, however none of them really have had the chance to develop or really show their personalities yet with the exception of Echidna. The Witch of Greed herself is definitely a fun character and a positive addition to the anime. I liked how quirky and supportive she was but with the underlying knowledge that she would eventually reveal a more malicious nature befitting of a witch. The other witches haven’t had the time to do much yet, but the fact that there&#039;s a BDSM loli witch in an organic coffin who wants to eat me was enough to get me excited to learn more about all of the witches.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the visuals, character designs are vibrant and unique. The cast is incredibly expressive and the facial animations do a fantastic job at exemplifying each character’s pain, anguish, and suffering. Yeah, this anime really likes to highlight people’s misery! I enjoyed how the aesthetics would appropriately reflect the mood, such as the pastel color scheme utilized during Subaru’s first trial as well as the horror-esque effects applied for the yandere Emilia moments. The visuals as a whole were predominantly consistent, though there admittedly are some gaffes here and there in regards to designs and movement. <br />
<br />
The theme songs have the same energy as those present in season one, which was a positive for me. The soundtrack fits the mood accordingly. Whether it was playing more emotional tracks like during Subaru&#039;s touching first trial or more distorted sounds during disconcerting moments like Echidna&#039;s speech and literally every time Subaru dies in agony, the music elevated the impact of numerous scenes. Though what really blew me away was the voice acting. I forgot just how talented the seiyuu are. Rie Takahashi, Emilia’s voice actress, has got to have one of the most adorable voices on the planet. Plus her “aishiteru~” ASMR as Satella gave me chills. Also, Rem’s brief speaking moments in the show were literally ear porn in how sweet she sounds. Yeah, that probably sounds cringy as heck, but I can&#039;t deny the truth! Rem’s voice actress, Inori Minase, is just that good. The side characters like Beatrice and Roswaal all have unique vocal inflections that make them memorable as well. And of course, we can’t forget the believability of Subaru’s tormented screams courtesy of the great vocal talent of Kobayashi Yuusuke.<br />
<br />
Is Re:Zero season 2 better than its predecessor? Right now it&#039;s hard to say. We&#039;ll just have to wait for the second half of the season to air, which is something that I am highly anticipating and hyped for. What I can say however is that Re:Zero yet again blew me away. It expanded upon the characteristics that elevated the first season to greatness and impressed me with its excellent execution. Re:Zero isn&#039;t just an ideal isekai. It&#039;s more than that, and I believe it is a truly phenomenal anime capable of standing with the best in the industry. For me, Re:Zero is storytelling at its finest, and it&#039;s a show that I would most definitely encourage everyone to experience. <br />

    Since I&#039;ve read some plumb and dull reviews calling this series overrated without any attempt to state their reason for saying so I&#039;ll invalidate those rants with the following review, explaining the uniqueness and setting of this perfect cross of fantasy overload and the tangibility of the main character&#039;s mindset and being.<br />
<br />
Just read further if you have seen season 1, otherwise I really recommend watching and understanding it!<br />
The next paragraph is for anyone who didn&#039;t understand the richness of the first season so skip it if you&#039;re aware of it.<br />
<br />
Re:Zero is overall at first glance an action fantasy anime with an Isekai setting. After watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350489">
        the first season it should be crystal clear that this anime just uses these genres to maintain a setting for the more appropriate genres like Psychological, Drama and Thriller which will deepen the plot in the first season. The mastermind behind this must have realistically asked himself a lot of times how someone in this ridiculous fantasy driven world (which is by far not normal) could do something while holding no powers overall, regaining his sanity over and over while distinguishing absurd behavior from resonable actions. This all is getting triggered by the overload of all those crazy things which are happening to him, most of the time he&#039;s haunted by the curse which is also his only way out of a bad ending. And guess what? The character didn&#039;t press reset on a game and loaded a save file, he has to kill himself, therefore raised his madness every time he has to feel this brutal pain to regain a chance(!) to beat the unbeatable in a game of &quot;Guess the right answer out of ten thousand wrong ones!&quot;, since some of the right ways he chose are doomed by other factors he couldn&#039;t see coming. This conflicts, back and forth, getting rewared after all those horrible experiences and getting understood from his crush (I wouldn&#039;t call Emilia his love, this goes too far) shows how deep those characters are and how dull some people are out there, hoping to get another vanilla main hero who overcomes those things with ease since he&#039;s the hero (and he knows it). Therefore I&#039;ll say that you need a bit of empathy and compassion to understand the characters since they have more depth. And yes, it&#039;s normal for him to get upset and emotional if you&#039;re always confronting such miserable moments and it&#039;s beatiful to see that there are still anime out there embracing the humanity instead of illustrating it very dull. All of that brings me to the conclusion that this series is one hell of a ride which I could explain more and more and more and more deeply until the sun rises for the fifth&#039;s time, but I&#039;ll keep myself &quot;short&quot; and say it&#039;s one of very few series which deserves a 10/10 from myself (since perfection is such a huuuge statement).<br />
And then you got people telling him he shouldn&#039;t cry so much which explains the diversity of the rating, otherwise this series would have an overall rating of 9/10.<br />
<br />
Back to the second season. (I&#039;ve only watched four episodes, there&#039;ll be an updated version)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m really glad to see that over all those years the artstyle hasn&#039;t changed since this isn&#039;t always the case. Seeing the first episode I was instantly back on track, the transition between the seasons were super smooth without the need of extending it by a big throwback of what happened in the last season. The season starts were they left off, throwing you directly into the story with no warning so get your informations and knowledge together. The first and forth episode went on a little bit longer (~29 minutes) as the typical anime episode length which&#039;s totally new, but is crucial so that there will be no half assed cuts just to trim it to 24 minutes. There&#039;s a main plot / quest for this season which takes a different direction as the first season, but it&#039;s totally fine if there&#039;s something focus on in the second season since the rest of the story, character and all the details will be gradually introduced as we learn more about the main characters to build up more empathy (which happenend already in just 4 episodes). For me it&#039;s getting more and more understandable how Subaru acts like he does every now and then even though I had some assumptions already, trying to empathise with his mindset and behavior. I&#039;ve got some high expectations for this season and what I&#039;ve seen so far showed me that they could be met (future me insert here if it happened or not).<br />
<br />
Overall it&#039;s awesome to see this anime back in its style and glory. The rest will show itself in the upcoming weeks and episodes. See you then.

    I have an affinity for “Re:Zero” that I often struggle to divorce myself from when I’m looking at it objectively. I was two years out of high school attempting to navigate my adulthood, fettered by the shackles of wage-slavery, and weening myself off of an indulgent lifestyle that I feel the residuals of to this day. At the time, it seemed like anime was my preferred method of escapism, marrying the puerile wonder of animation with storytelling, two things that are very dear to me. There was a lot that I gleaned from Re:Zero, particularly in its cautionary tale about the potential ramifications of escapism

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350379">
        (in Subaru’s case, escaping to a different world did nothing for his self-worth). My maid waifu consolation prize must’ve gotten lost in the mail somewhere. <br />
<br />
Episode 18 of Re:Zero effectively reinforced the strengths in this show’s conflict when it was often lampshaded by tired fantasy minutiae/world-building, sky whales, and a perfunctory “Game of Thrones”-esque political subplot. I apologize if I come off blasé to any hardcore Re:Zero fans (full disclosure, I haven’t read the source and I’m not really all that interested in doing so unless the discrepancies are just THAT egregious), but in truth, none of these components that make up Re:Zero’s vertebrae enthrall me quite as much as the abrasive deconstruction of its main character’s psyche due to repeated trauma (I’m a sucker for the psychological). Re:Zero&#039;s centerpiece is Subaru, an unapologetically but deliberately flawed otaku self-insert that shines a light on the darker implications of that lifestyle.  <br />
<br />
The methodology behind making him such a transparent analogue for the people who are more than likely consuming his story, in my mind, makes him a cut above the rest when you look at other isekai protagonists. His only real boy-wonder superpower is one that causes him immense pain and stress, which is pretty counterintuitive but purposeful/subversive nonetheless. Due to his lifestyle in his previous life and admitted self-hatred, Subaru is a socially dysfunctional character. In Season 1, you got the sense that even in a normal setting, he’d struggle to even properly tie his shoes without being overcome with anxiety. Through his contempt for himself and an unmitigated onslaught of misery, Subaru’s deeply metaphorical plight as a character was one that I really sank my teeth into. Watching him spiral further and further into desperation and borderline insanity to find a way to overwrite his mistakes or even just to find a sense of normalcy in the world was something that I could easily latch onto. <br />
<br />
And I’m not saying it’s a terribly original concept to make the main character in your anime an otaku as to open a dialogue, I mean look at friggin “Welcome to the N.H.K.&#039;&#039; (not to say one is inherently better than the other). I can’t blame anyone for being averse to a character like Subaru, because he is utterly defined by his flaws and often confoundingly asinine decision-making skills. It goes without saying, but your enjoyment of this series will completely hang its hat on how much you are willing to accept Subaru as the focal character.  <br />
<br />
I&#039;d be lying to myself if I said I wasn&#039;t caught in the grips of this show&#039;s pace. But eventually, that petered out, and the reason as to why is quite simple. Subaru developed. The aptly named episode &quot;From Zero&quot; was a genuine clean slate for this character, and as a byproduct, this story can no longer readily rely on what it was that made it as effortlessly entertaining as it was to begin with. Now that Subaru’s arc feels fully formed, the only natural progression for this anime...is for it to just continue being an isekai, and that just doesn’t interest me. I saw very gradual signs of this in the later episodes of its first season (that friggin whale arc was rough man) but now the plot has essentially kneecapped itself by forcing its main character to move past what it was that made him mildly interesting. I’m not some sadist who needs this show to lean on the excessive gore and horror that mottled the episodes in its first season so it can return to its psychological thriller roots as to torture this guy. However, now that Subaru seems to be a new man (so to speak), the script DESPERATELY needs to give him something to make him interesting again. <br />
<br />
The first episode had the unique opportunity to rob Subaru of his mental faculties yet again by taking away the only person that gave him that modicum of self-worth...so why did they forgo that? Any sorrow or pain this character will feel from here on will just feel manufactured now that he has taken what has happened to Rem with a disappointing amount of stride. He even goes so far as to nonchalantly reaffirm to Emilia that Rem is “just as important” to him as she is, which is just insulting. I’m not even over the moon about Rem as a character, but she was the only one in the previous season whom Subaru was able to cultivate a genuine unconditional relationship with and resoundingly had better chemistry with him than Emilia. Watching Subaru and Emilia interact is like watching a one-sided relationship in some rom-com, and not a particularly good one. <br />
<br />
Re:Zero was never willing to get quite as intimate with its ancillary characters (although Rem comes somewhat close) as it was with Subaru. You can attribute that to this story being a first-person account from Subaru’s perspective so you will only get to know these characters as well as he does. By its very design, these secondary characters will never be as interesting as Subaru, and that’s because it’s not willing to compromise the spotlight in order to cut someone else open with that same psychological scalpel, even though that has the potential to greatly mitigate some of this show’s problems. Fantasy series will often balloon their casts with one-dimensional characters for the sake of making their worlds feel populated, and this show is no different. <br />
<br />
Getting smatterings of Subaru’s past life (while not entirely pertinent) isn’t a bad touch although the timing and context makes it feel disembodied from the rest of the story, I also don’t feel like this is entirely necessary. The art and animation look fine, there’s not much of a discrepancy between the first and second seasons. The opening theme is also not nearly as good as the previous two. I was surprised to find out that there wasn’t a change in director because S2 genuinely feels like it’s moving far too quickly for its own good. This season is slated to be split-cour which makes me curious as to how exactly it’s going to be compressed/edited for that purpose. <br />
<br />
Re:Zero just isn’t what it used to be for me. S2 has gotten off on the wrong foot and, in my view, does nothing but further obfuscate the strengths of its first season. It feels so neutered and sanitized now that its focal character has become such a blank slate. Instead of presenting fresh ideas and concepts, S2 is content with doing the bare minimum by playing in the proverbial sandbox all on its lonesome, and I can’t say I’m that interested in joining it. Even if it gets better, it’ll never have that same bite that it used to.

    Few shows in recent memory have been the center of as much controversy as Re:ZERO. While one side claims it to be an indisputable masterpiece, basing themselves on arguments like “Subaru’s realism” and the “deconstruction of the isekai genre”, the other is often of the opinion that it’s more spectacle than substance, repetitive shlock that often relies on shock factor more than anything. This division combined with 2016’s infamous “best girl” discourse has served to turn people off from any future installments of the series, and perhaps few can blame them for that.<br />
<br />
Now, taking all this controversy around it into account, is this franchise still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358375">
        worth a shot after these 4 years? Absolutely. <br />
<br />
The first season focused on a deeply personal character study of Subaru, his savior complex and his eventual self-awareness, with one overlapping character arc in the form of Rem’s. Delivering on every front from visual directing to its creative use of the episodic format, along with its thriller aspect, it’s no wonder it became such a phenomenon in 2016. But Subaru’s arc has concluded; his entitlement and attitude have been addressed, his character arc seemingly finished. So where does the story go from here? Does it turn into—perish the thought—another standard isekai fantasy adventure, the very thing fans claimed it to “deconstruct”?<br />
<br />
The answer is, thankfully, a firm no. Instead of going down that path in the next arc, the writer instead builds a complex web of mysteries and events, making use of foreshadowing laid down all the way back in the show’s first arcs. Every episode answers questions while bringing up newer ones, all of it leading to what might possibly be one of the most satisfying payoffs in the medium.<br />
<br />
But while the solid plot and mystery form the backbone of this arc, along with the more history-oriented worldbuilding, the characters are its true highlight. Each character has their own agenda, their own struggles and weaknesses explored across different timelines— and for such a large cast, each one of them is handled with care and has a strong reason for being part of the narrative (...okay, except Petra.) Without limiting itself to Subaru, Re:ZERO doesn’t hesitate to turn a character’s world upside down and challenge their worldviews. In Subaru’s case, this comes in the form of exploring the mechanic of Return by Death to its limits, with multiple twists and revelations regarding the ability shaping the way Subaru approaches it, allowing him to go through multiple phases of development. As for the rest of the cast, each loop allows the exploration of different facets of characters, in such a way that a single timeline wouldn’t allow, with special care not to lose important moments of development in “failed” realities. Different circumstances lead to different reactions, and sometimes a character’s reaction is different even in seemingly similar circumstances, throwing both Subaru and the viewer for a loop.<br />
<br />
That is one of the stronger aspects of Re:ZERO. It asks the viewer to think, hands them new pieces of the puzzle every episode and instead of outright giving every answer whenever a question is raised, it takes things gradually for a satisfying payoff in the end. It isn’t the kind of series you can sit down and turn your brain off to watch; you would still be entertained by the surface-level presentation, as it is in no way boring, but you’d be missing what the story really is trying to tell you. The amount of theorycrafting I see for Re:ZERO across different platforms, now and back in 2016, reminds me of the early days of the Attack on Titan anime and manga. These are the kinds of series that demand your attention, and if you’re willing to give it and engage with the material, you’re rewarded with layers upon layers of character work, foreshadowing and worldbuilding. <br />
<br />
The cynical proponents of “Re:ZERO is spectacle and no substance” would be half-correct; the spectacle is there, which allows the show to be entertaining even on a surface level. Who doesn’t love a femme fatale with an attractive design and a disturbing love for intestines? Who doesn’t like dramatic endings to timelines, even ignoring the subtext and meaning behind them, if any? Who doesn’t like perfect cliffhangers and title card drops? And yet, all that said and done, the spectacle doesn’t make up the main appeal of the series. Re:ZERO isn’t lacking in climaxes, and while undiscerning viewers may write them off as mere shock value, every one of those more powerful scenes serves a narrative purpose, whether it be to introduce a new factor to the narrative, showcase a certain character’s mindset and goals, or set up foreshadowing and new stakes to face. In the past, critics would often deem moments to be “suffer porn”, while ignoring what those moments mean to the overall narrative, the characterization or development they offer to the characters included within; central themes like loneliness, stagnation, self-reliance and twisted love are lost on some viewers, hung up only on the superficial layer of dark fantasy that adorns Re:ZERO. Those strengths almost make me want to forgive the existence of Petra, a minor character whose role is entirely limited to establishing stakes for Subaru in this first cour.<br />
<br />
On the more technical side of things, for the most part, Re:ZERO hasn’t lost its touch. While I have some reservations, big enough to prevent it from attaining a perfect score, the production is impressive on many levels. Yuusuke Kobayashi delivers a visceral performance as Subaru once again, with an astonishing voice range as he conveys moments of despair, relief and banter to near perfection. Rie Takahashi is another exceptional actress, from a kind voice that embodies the character of Emilia to a bone-chilling soft voice that almost feels like a twisted take on ASMR. Of course, Maaya Sakamoto as Echidna and many others deliver incredible performances as well, but the voice work isn’t the only triumph of the series’ audio presentation: the music is also what helps sell most scenes, from low &amp; frightening bells amplifying moments of horror, to strong and dramatic instrumental pieces that immerses you into the scene in moments of action or tension. I’d even argue that in terms of sound, this season ranks above the first, even with the latter’s legendary production value.<br />
<br />
The directing nails important scenes and doesn’t hold back the emotional peaks and gut-punches; the rest of the season is decent, still keeping the deliberate and clever framing choices the first season is known for, but also stumbling at times, unlike its predecessor. I feel like the adaptation could’ve done more justice to a couple of villains— thankfully, these misses are limited to a couple of scenes in the earlier parts. Director Watanabe’s ambition truly shows this season, his time in KyoAni once again showing through his use of soft colors in certain scenes, reminiscent of the famous 8th or 11th episodes of the first season.<br />
<br />
Everything I’ve pointed out were fairly minor nitpicks in an otherwise solid production; however, what isn’t a minor nitpick is the apparent downgrade in the art department. The unshaded ears discourse aside, this season feels like the characters’ designs have lost a lot of their flair and unique characteristics. This is especially felt with Emilia, as you’ll notice the contrast when you transition from the first season to the second. The new noses for the male characters are unnecessary unfitting, perhaps even ugly to some. Along with the simplified designs comes a loss of shading in general and a minor downgrade in animation (nowhere near AOT season 3 or, god forbid, SDS) which undermines a few scenes and characters, to a small extent.<br />
<br />
The reason why I hold this season’s production in high regard still, despite it not reaching the levels of Season 1, is simple: Re:ZERO is a passion project by White Fox. The studio doesn’t hesitate to skip OP and ED sequences to include more content in the episode, leaving as little as possible on the cutting room floor. Episodes are extended far beyond the usual time slot in the medium (and yet still feel far too short), up to half an hour to give more content, at the cost of ad revenue on Japanese TV that week. It’s an unusual, astonishing effort, especially given the current work-at-home circumstances. The first cour is 13 episodes, but amounts to over 16 episodes of content for any other series thanks to extended runtimes and skipped OP/EDs. I can only applaud director Watanabe for his special effort and dedication to faithfulness to the source, even if some cuts are inevitably made.<br />
<br />
Don’t go into this Part 1 expecting a complete exposition, climax and denouement. Arc 4’s is a complex plot with many overlapping character arcs, events and moving parts to keep track of, and it isn’t something to be resolved in 13 episodes. Mysteries are established, character motivations are hinted at or revealed, stakes which truly challenge the protagonist’s Return by Death are set in this Part 1. Everything else is reserved for the second part of this arc.<br />
<br />
Re:ZERO impressed me. After my disillusionment with the genre, an impactful and layered character drama that doesn’t hold back its punches, with a talented writer and an ambitious director to back it up, was the last thing I expected from the “isekai” craze. In very few series have I seen tweets about people calling or hugging their parents after an episode.<br />
<br />
For all the misunderstandings and controversy around it, Re:ZERO is a special series, one well worth the investment. I, for one, can’t wait for what’s to come.<br />

        Re: Zero. A series that exploded during its first season and it was at the peak of its popularity before the four years gap that diminished its momentum. Similar to Attack on Titan, Re: Zero brought something that was fresh and original -- in a sense. Especially when compared to a conventional Isekai. While Re: Zero was able to keep people hooked through its gores, shocks, and dark tone, it was never able to make people care about any of the casts. And unlike Attack on Titan, the world-building in Re: Zero is nonexistent. <br />
<br />
   I mention world building

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350394">
        because if the anime failed to develop any relatable cast, then at least make the world realistic. If not, make it believable. It failed at that too. All we get to see in the anime is characters traveling to different locations to uncover mysteries. After one location is reached, the anime moved on to the next. This is the problem. There are no breaks for explorations, which is detrimental because the audience couldn’t care less about what’s happening on screen. <br />
<br />
    Prior to the introduction of the villains of the Witch’s Cult, Subaru, Emilia, and Rem were traveling to participate in an event that would make Emilia the next ruler of a nation. The villains then ambushed them, killing most of the soldiers and injured Rem. This then prompts the story to take a different avenue -- which is to unravel the mysteries of Witch’s Cult and bring Rem back to peoples’ memories. Upon the introduction of, what seemed to be, the main villains of this season, we never get to see them again. Because of their absence, however, there’s no sense of danger. And what we end up with is Emilia and Subaru traveling to different locations to uncover what was set from the onset of this season. <br />
<br />
   The casts from the 1st season were all pretty much underdeveloped and the ones that did got some progression stayed stale. <br />
  <br />
   Emilia. With Rem being out of the picture due do coma, you would think that this is the perfect time for Emilia to shine. It’s entrenched from episode one that she wanted to help Subaru in any way she can. Besides her social status and connection to various eminent people to use as her leverage to gain information, she can’t do anything outside of that. Especially when it comes to situations that require physical need.  <br />
<br />
   We all know that Subaru is the embodiment of a pure person that will do anything for the ones that he holds dear to. As it was shown in the previous season, he was willing to die for it. But, given the fact that he’s stuck in a loop whenever he dies, he won’t hesitate to kill himself over and over if it’s in the name of helping people. That’s why this is also the flaw of his character. <br />
<br />
   He’s still the same person. He hasn’t had any character development because of his sole purpose in the series. Because of how the series set the circumstances for his character, he doesn’t fear death. It’s a tool that he can use to change and manipulate the events to his will. Thus, the guilt of killing himself won’t have much impact on anyone. Not even himself. And no, flashbacks doesn&#039;t count as character development.<br />
   <br />
   Overall, Re:Zero is a mediocre series with its own distinctive twits within an Isekai genre. It’s more of a slow-paced mystery series with not much of thoughts put into it. If anything, it’s certainly better than Sword Art Online.    <br />
<br />
Score: 4/10<br />

    Today on &quot;I can&#039;t understand why you like this sh*t so much&quot; We have Re: Zero.<br />
<br />
Where should I begin? Let&#039;s start with the main feature of this anime, the time reset is the most convenient plot armor I&#039;ve ever seen, just popping up in the most critical moments, thus destroying the development of the characters; because every time it happened, it fixed all the mess around, and it doesn&#039;t leave anything that we could consider substantial. I mean, let&#039;s take all the deaths that happened in the first season for instance. Why would you kill anybody dramatically if, at the end of the day, they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351839">
        will back to life? How exactly this will affect the personality of the characters, if every possible consequence just... vanish? Without mention that the checkpoints are most of them very convenient since they always went back to a moment at the story where everyone was alive.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a loser who says motivational speeches and has a superpower that turns him into a very op human being, since he&#039;s able to learn and fix everything because of the superpower he has, it results in something unfair; besides that his behavior is inconsistent, there are so many moments when he looks afraid of dying, despite he can return by death, and he has done that before already.<br />
<br />
The side characters are terrible, many of them are flat, with absolutely no development, and the few that are explore, just stay there to help the protagonist, they seem to have none of their own will, they just follow the desire of the protagonist.

    Praise us as we are tasted, allow us as we prove.<br />
<br />
As it says this season started with a bang and left us aww in the very first episode. It took some time too just come back from that shock.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
All the pandora&#039;s box are starting to come off as each episode is a thrillers of its own. And 29 might be the best episode of the series in a super emotional episode.<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
It got perfect art which it deserves. ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
Its getting better and better each episode.<br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
Nothing to say about its character are just too good.(ALSO I LOVE EMILIA)<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I never thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review351132">
        it could deliver like this absolute carnage. The only complain I have for it is 13 episode is too short for it TOO DAMN SHORT.<br />
<br />
Verdict: MUST WATCH X100000000

Re:Zero, a show that exploded in popularity back in 2016, and now after a 4-year break it makes it&#039;s long-awaited re:turn in the form of its second season; fortunately for me, I did not have to wait for 4 years for the 2nd season as I&#039;ve

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358355">
        only started watching it early this year due to lockdown. Re:Zero holds a very special place in my heart, as it&#039;s one of the few shows that always keeps me on edge with every single episode, and I loved this show to bits, and after watching the second season, I&#039;ve grown to love and appreciate this series more.<br />
<br />
Season 2 picks up where Season 1 had ended. However compared to the first season, this plot for this season seems to be more focused and with a clearer goal, Subaru and the gang trapped in Sanctuary, clear trials, and get out. But since it&#039;s Re:Zero we&#039;re talking about, it can&#039;t be that simple and easy. Slowly Subaru starts getting many more problems than he has ever gotten before, cornering him to the brink of throwing away his very humanity. With just the first part of the 2nd season, this is already feeling as intense as the first season, we get a lot more deaths than and of course more suffering.<br />
<br />
We also get introduced to plenty of new characters, but balancing it out to not have too much, and giving each new character a proper role to fulfill, and I&#039;ve always thought about this in Re:Zero in general, it does a really good job of managing it&#039;s characters without them just being filler and utterly useless, and with plenty of depth for each character, this season we get to experience more interactions and development with the relationships of the cast. Not only that we also got a lot more information about the lore of not only Sanctuary, the Witches, and Return by Death. But in typical Re:Zero fashion, for every answer we get, two more questions pop out. I am very thankful we already are getting many answers to questions we&#039;ve been asking 4 years ago, and I&#039;m hopeful that we get more answers in the 2nd half.<br />
<br />
The Witches are especially intriguing, I never expected them to act the way they do, I expected them to be more sinister, but it seems like most of them were just misunderstood. Echidona in particular is a very interesting character, she&#039;s someone who wants to satisfy her everlasting greed, and want to see every possible outcome. She&#039;s someone who doesn&#039;t comprehend human emotions and will do anything to satisfy her greed. The other witches&#039; mentality is really fascinating, Minerva wants to heal everything and prioritizes healing anyone that&#039;s hurt before herself even if it costs her life, Daphne wants to sate the world, but in doing so brought about ruin and despair, Typhon, at first just seems like a small and innocent child but her authority is something more dangerous than the other witches, Sekhmet is sloth itself by definition, even breathing is too tiresome for her. Carmilla has a shy and timid personality, however, she isn&#039;t someone to underestimate, her authority is something not to be taken lightly, and finally Satella and the Witch of Envy, this season gave us a LOT of information about them as they are apparently two different personalities. her &quot;love&quot; for Subaru remains a mystery, hopefully, we get more information in the second half.<br />
<br />
This season gave us more information to characters like Roswaal, and Beatrice, we got to know their goals and motivations as well as some backstory particularly with Beatrice. Garfiel on the surface seems like your typical Bakugo type character, but there seems to be more to him than meets the eye, and I expect Part 2 to give us more information about him and his past. His interactions with Ram are really cute as well. Otto became best boy in just one episode, my view of him from his introduction to now has changed significantly for the better, I first thought of him as a dick for pushing Subaru but now his actions are justified due to his Divine Protection, and him proclaiming to Subaru that he is his friend was just so wholesome, it made me tear up a bit.<br />
<br />
We also got more development for Subaru, giving us a whole episode dedicated to his backstory back in the real world, something no other isekai has done or executed properly, it gives us much more explanation to Subaru&#039;s character and why he acts certain ways in certain situations and it helps us understand and appreciate his character much more. He&#039;s a really great main character and by far my favorite character in the series, and one of my favorite of all time. It&#039;s honestly rare to get protagonists with as depth as him these days, and I appreciate the author for not making him another bland and generic isekai MC.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack for this show is amazing, however the lack of Myth&amp;Roid and also the lack of insert songs are disappointing, instead, we got awesome tracks. Voice acting is incredible as always. The opening although is cut most of the time, is still really good, the foreshadowing and symbolism are great. the ending song is best for me this season.<br />
<br />
I also appreciate the amount of passion and effort White Fox is giving to Re:Zero. Not only do they cut the openings and endings, but they also extend the episode runtime to add in more content, that&#039;s not something any show can just do, and it just shows the love White Fox gives for Re:Zero. I hope they continue to give what Re:Zero truly deserves, and I hope they continue to give Re:Zero the love and care it truly deserves.<br />
<br />
However there are also some problems I had, particularly with the adaptation, the art was simplified and some character designs do feel off sometimes, this is especially true for Episode 10 in particular, and not only that, animation took some hit as well, that is to be expected because the staff was forced to work in-home, due to the pandemic, although even before the lockdown, and the outbreak, the art of episode 1 - 5(Starting episode 6 onwards, the staff had to work in-home) was still lackluster compared to the first season, other than that I didn&#039;t have many problems with this season.<br />
<br />
It pains me to see when people call this show out as just suffering porn and just has good waifus, when it&#039;s more than that, and most people can&#039;t see it. Re:Zero is not a story about a guy getting dying in many gruesome ways just to get a harem in the end, instead, it is a story about a guy just trying his best to live his life, in a world where he doesn&#039;t fit it, where he has no purpose or goal, who despite knowing of his weaknesses and shortcomings desperately try to save those who are important to him, struggling and facing the consequences of his actions at the same time.<br />
<br />
With how the plot is shaping up this season, I&#039;m very excited how it would all turn out in the second half, considering the amount of buildup this first half gave us, I&#039;m hoping the emotional payoff in the second half will be worth it. I really don&#039;t know how Subaru is going to get out of this situation, this seems impossible, then again that&#039;s also what I thought of the second half of season 1. Overall, this season has been absolutely amazing. With each episode it just gets better and better, I&#039;m always at the edge of my seat every single week, anxiously waiting for the next, very few shows can pull this off for me, and Re:Zero is definitely one of those few shows. I absolutely cannot wait for Part 2, my excitement cannot be contained, this is going to be the longest 3 months of my life.

    As of the time I&#039;m writing this review I&#039;ve only watched up to and including episode 4.<br />
--UPDATE---<br />
I&#039;ve updated the review after episode 11. Please check the updated section at the bottom for more details. <br />
<br />
Story (9/10): <br />
<br />
So the hit or miss series Re:Zero comes back with a second season with more new mysteries and characters. With how the narrative is structured for this season it&#039;s clear to see that the world-building elements that were present in the 1st season will be used in the second season again to develop the world of Re:Zero through the trial of the sanctuary. The foreshadowing set up in season

          <span style="display: none;" id="review350470">
        1 pays off in the second season as we explore more deeply into Subaru&#039;s insecurities. The dialogue which is the single most important aspect of the story as it&#039;s told mostly through dialogue is done well. It doesn&#039;t treat you like a child to hold your hand and explain each and every single thing but rather helps you to figure it out. The dialogue between characters is often believable and genuine and characterizes them to be like real-life people you would know. The pacing has been absolutely amazing so far and in the latest episode it was 29 minutes! Overall the story so far has been great and hopefully we&#039;ll see some of the mysteries asked in season 1 be answered in this season.<br />
<br />
Art (7/10):<br />
The visuals are a bit disappointing. It isn&#039;t really anything special but just typical White Fox.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): <br />
I am of the camp that find the ED to be much better than the OP but so far the soundtrack hasn&#039;t met the standard that season 1 has set for the series. The sound is used to support the emotions that you would feel and doesn&#039;t feel out of place. Overall it&#039;s pretty good but nothing amazing. <br />
<br />
Character (9/10):<br />
The actions and motivations for Subaru that were shown in season 1 are finally explained in season 2 where we are shown the source of Subaru&#039;s insecurities which explains his (cringy) actions taken in the 1st season. Although Emilia is still your typical cardboard cut-out isekai heroine I imagine she&#039;ll be given more depth if she enters the trial.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9/10): <br />
So far I&#039;ve really enjoyed the show. I really hope to see the character dynamic between Subaru and Garfiel explored more deeply and that the new mysteries that season 2 has opened up with to be answered. I think if you liked season 1 you&#039;ll enjoy season 2 as well and if you didn&#039;t - at least give up to episode 4 a try. <br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
Okay. Some of the bigger mysteries surrounding S1 are finally answered in S2 and the pay-off is immense. Seriously, hats off to Tappei for the foreshadowing and writing in S1 that is finally rewarded in S2. Not only do the mysteries in S2 feel like they matter and are vital to the worldbuilding (for ex. compare this to the mansion arc which had no world building) they are built up in a way that allows you to deeply think and theorize with Subaru in uncovering  them in a way that is fun and challenging. The stakes feel much higher and the wall more taller. We see sides to characters that we&#039;ve never seen before (mainly Roswaal and Beatrice) and god is it entertaining. Their quirks which may have left some viewers feeling confused in S1 are finally explained. The events in S2 feel essential in helping us understand the mystery behind the world of Subaru and it&#039;s rewarding to the viewers because it helps us feel that the plot is going forward instead of at a standstill. People who complain that Subaru is a brainless simp will be happy knowing that Subaru&#039;s changed a lot from his simp days because of his new attitude in approaching problems and resolving interpersonal conflicts. The episodes keep getting better and better and at this point with how meticulously and thorough Tappei has been,  for leaving us breadcrumbs in this season and setting up the story for the next season, I think it would be a very rewarding experienece to commit to watching this, and when you do watch the next season - you&#039;ll be rewarded for your patience as it unravels all the mysteries. At this point in time I&#039;ll give it a 9.5<br />
