    I’ve been waiting for it since I finished the manga and finally, it’s here. Shingeki no Kyojin: Kuinaki Sentaku is better than I’ve expected.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
The story focuses on Levi’s past, as the title tells us.<br />
The first episode is about Levi, Isabel and Farlan living in the underground capital and “earning” money as thugs, in order to get the chance to live on the surface someday. Because of being captured by Erwin Smith, the three of them decide to join the Survey Corps. But unfortunately, it&#039;s not that easy. Councilman Lovof wants them to retrieve a secret document from Erwin.<br />
Coming to the second episode, the focus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171885">
        lies on their first days in the Survey Corps, as well as on the plan on how to get the document that Lovof needs. And their first expedition takes them outside the walls, where Levi, Isabel and Farlan have an encounter with their first titans. However, some unexpected things happen...<br />

Isabel and Farlan are two new main characters, who are companions of Levi. Farlan is cool-headed and calm, while Isabel is energetic and vivacious. We get to see more of Levi’s character as well, which I find really interesting.<br />
Beside new characters, we also see new sides of Levi and Erwin and get back-story of Keith Shadis, current Commander of the Survey Corps.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Great, as expected from Shingeki no Kyojin. Levi&#039;s face expressions look really intense, and the scenes, where the 3D maneuver gear is used are breathtaking. I especially liked the chase after Levi, Farlan and Isabel, as well as the fight between Levi and the titan, where we get to see a lot of action and emotions.<br />
<br />
Music 10/10<br />
Basically the same music as in Shingeki no Kyojin, and they use some of the soundtracks pretty well for emphazising the atmosphere of the OVA.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I really enjoyed every second of Kuinaki Sentaku. We get to see some new faces  and the chance to gain an insight into Levi’s past, before he joined the Survey Corps.<br />
<br />
Overall, I’m highly satisfied with Shingeki no Kyojin: Kuinaki Sentaku, although I think that two episodes aren’t enough for such a strong character like Levi. Nevertheless, they did a really good job. Definitely a must watch.<br />

    I have been looking forward to watching this OVA, as soon as i heard it was being made.<br />
<br />
Story 7/10<br />
<br />
This new installment of the Attack on Titan universe tells us a bit more about Levis&#039; past and how he joined the survey corps. All the while being introduced to two new characters, Farlan and Isabel.<br />
<br />
Characters 7/10<br />
<br />
Farlan and Isabel are two new interesting characters.<br />
Isabel seems to have a more childish attitude (A little like Zoë Hange), whilst Farlan is more responsible (taking care of his sick friend)<br />
Levi hasn&#039;t changed at all. Still the same guy as always. Still cleaning.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
<br />
Holy shit is the 3D maneuver gear awesome!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171637">
        We are given an intense and thrilling chase scene with LOTS of 3D maneuver gear usage. Animation is really fluid and the underground environment is a breath of fresh air.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
The voice acting is as always great and we are given a new soundtrack to fit with the chase scene. Lots of new 3D maneuver gear sounds is also heard.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
I just fucking loved it! Everything from the throwback with Levi cleaning, to the soundtrack and action scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
<br />
If you liked the original Attack on Titan show and want to know more about the world and Levi, then this is a must watch!

        I have got to say that ever since I read the manga and found out about the release of this OVA I&#039;ve been anxiously waiting for the occasion to watch it. It&#039;s hard to say that the story impressed me, and you&#039;ll see for yourself whether you think the same or not. Of course, nothing can beat the ingenuity of the titan-related stuff, not even something from Levi&#039;s mysterious past, although we get to see a side of him that we didn&#039;t really get a glimpse of in the original anime. The other characters play an important role in his development,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171771">
        and although they&#039;re not all that unique, together they make a really lovely trio.<br />
<br />
    Okay, let&#039;s forget about the story - you can read elsewhere about that, and... watch it? That&#039;s a good idea, y&#039;know. Let&#039;s see... the art is unquestionably amazing. Just as the SnK anime, it&#039;s unique and you&#039;ve got to appreciate how well the fight scenes were animated. From what I&#039;ve noticed (and I actually paid attention to it quite a lot), the soundtrack used was the one from the original anime, and it certainly fit the atmosphere. I&#039;ve got to say that both art and sound make it a lot more enjoyable than just reading the manga.<br />
<br />
    Blah blah blah. Hey, it&#039;s my first review - so let&#039;s just get to the point: definitely worth watching if you&#039;re a true Shingeki no Kyojin fan. And it&#039;s never too late to become one...<br />

    ~Skip this if you just want to read the review~<br />
So ever since I watched Attack on Titan, I&#039;ve been excited for the second series and so after non-stop thoughts about Attack on Titan, I decided to watch the series dubbed and it was even better. Shortly after watching it dubbed, I heard about this small ova, Attack on Titan: Birth of Levi. I could not wait for this to come out as it was based on my favourite character of the series, Levi. The trailer also got me very excited about this ova. As it turns out, I got to the ova a few days

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172551">
        late after release which had me down but then the day finally came. So, was I disappointed? <br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story is pretty solid, it&#039;s about Levi&#039;s past in the underground slums with no access to sunlight unless you pay to go see and even if you do, you won&#039;t be able to stay very long without any citizenship. In order for Levi, Farlen and Isabel to survive, they go around stealing food and earning money as hired thugs. <br />
<br />
One day, a mysterious man comes to there front door with a deal, Levi tells him to piss off but the man says he&#039;s already paid his compensation, taking his friend to a surface hospital for treatment for his legs. Levi, Farlen and Isabel then follow the man to the surface to find out what the job is. <br />
<br />
The next day, they rob a few merchants for food and then they get into a chase, from the looks, it&#039;s the military police, shortly after doing evasion mauvers, they continue to get followed and they figure out that it&#039;s not the military police but the servey corps. After you see Levi do a few fancy tricks, he gets into a fight with Erwin. Erwin then tells him to surrender as his friends have been captured. After being tied up, Erwin asks how they learnt to use manoeuvre gear like that, he doesn&#039;t respond and he gets his face beaten into the ground. Farlen then answers. Erwin then ask Levi to join them or get punished but the law. Levi unwilling accepts. <br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art is just amazing, as usual. It especially looks spectacular when they are being chased by Erwin. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9 <br />
The sound/music is amazing and it really sets the atmosphere and mood of the ova, as expected from this amazing series. There is no disappointment here.  <br />
<br />
Characters: 9<br />
The ova introduces us two new main characters which support Levi by being his companions. <br />
<br />
Levi in this ova is the leader of the group and has two companions, they both trust him and respect him. He also cares about his hygiene (which is funny, he pummels a guy to the ground because he touched his shoulder with his dirty hand).<br />
<br />
Farlan is one of Levi&#039;s companions and is able to keep himself calm and steady. He has a lot of respect for Levi and so in return, Levi also respects him and his opinions. He is also very talented at using the 3D manoeuvre gear. <br />
<br />
Isabel is another one of Levi&#039;s companions and very energetic who&#039;s confident in her abilities. She cares for her friends, because she is willing to sacrifice information to keep Levi from being hurt. She is also very talented at using the 3D manoeuvre gear. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I have been waiting a long time for this ova and it didn&#039;t disappoint in any area and so I really enjoyed this ova and I cannot wait till the second one is released to find out happens when he first joins the Survey Corps.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
I have been overjoyed with the first ova from the two being made but with such a strong story and characters, I am a little disappointed with that there will only be two airing. They have done great with the first episode and I&#039;m sure the second will be even better. <br />
<br />

    Shingeki no Kyojin: No Regrets/Kuinaku Sentaku is  a spin-off of the ever popular Attack on Titan on which our beloved supporting character Levi finally gets a main role.  This shows the flashback of Levi before joining the Survey Corps. You don&#039;t really need to watch AOT first if you want to watch this. <br />
<br />
The story leads to Levi, Isabel and Farlan living in an underground city in which serves as the Capital&#039;s dump. Levi and his friends are criminals who steals food, money, etc. using a 3D Maneuver gear. Not much I can say &#039;bout the story since it&#039;s already written in the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185525">
        synopsis. For my score for the story, I gave it a 9, it&#039;s not really perfect but it&#039;s really interesting. And which leads later in a situation in which we would be really tense and shock. The thrills sent to me lead it to a 9 score to the story.<br />
<br />
The art is still the same, Levi&#039;s face, nothing really much has changed (even though years had passed), and Erwin still looks like himself. Nothing really much changed. <br />
<br />
Sound? Opening and ending was the 2nd one from the anime. But the background music, OST, was great! As expected from a wonderful anime. <br />
<br />
The character development, this was the one that gave impact on us. Levi is Levi, Erwin is Erwin. But the bond between Levi, Isabel, and Farlan was something you find heartwarming. The development between them is great.<br />
<br />
So far, I enjoyed this OVA, even though this is a spin-off, I still gave it a high score. Because of how well-made this is. And how much impact it gave to me.<br />
<br />
Overall, I loved this spin-off. It already became one of my faves, of course, not because Levi is the protagonist, it&#039;s because of somehow it gave me an impulse of excitement. I never really found a spin-off this exciting and tense. And If you think spin-offs aren&#039;t worth watching, try watching this one. And yes, that means I recommend this.

---The review contains spoilers---<br />
<br />
So, a quick review after watching the 2nd OVA.<br />
Having enjoyed the manga I thought of taking a quick look at this piece, which to be honest, wasn&#039;t dissapointing, but I expected a little bit more.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
Not bad, it made me feel nervous, sad, excited and stuff like a normal anime.<br />
But, talking about the influence it has on Shingeki no Kyojin, it&#039;s really good. You get to see why Levi is how he is, and how the expeditions outside the walls have changed.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
I was going to start my statement with &quot;It&#039;s the same as Shingeki no Kyojin&quot; but no. Animation was about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185247">
        the same, what surprised me was that drawing was different. People were more humanized (sort of to say xD) and titans were made even more terrific. Oh my gosh the titan Levi took down...<br />
Rain was done pretty good in my opinion!<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
Ok, here I can truly say &quot;Same as Shingeki no Kyojin&quot;.<br />
As always, seiyuus did an outstanding job, specially my hero Kamiya Hiroshi-san.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
Here comes the strong part.<br />
We&#039;ve know that Levi (yes, sorry, I&#039;m a big fan of this character in particular xD) is tough, serious and seems to be bad tempered. In the OVA we get to see his more &quot;caring big brother / human&quot; side. At the end I couldn&#039;t stop sharing some tears with him, when he sees Isabel&#039;s and Farlan&#039;s corpses (well, only Isabel&#039;s head and half of Farlan). <br />
These two also are made to be loved, Farlan is the type of the more serious guy, besides Irvin, he&#039;s the only one capable to calm and contain Levi, and Isabel is the typical silly character that is always happy no matter what.<br />
And Irvin, well. Badass.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
It isn&#039;t the typical &quot;I wanted more&quot;, it&#039;s more like &quot;It had needed to have more&quot; I mean, if you haven&#039;t read the manga, it&#039;s ok, but some things were shortened, to put it in another way..<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10<br />
Pretty good! Can&#039;t wait for the second season and the live action movie!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. Any doubts? Comment my profile and we can chat. Sayōnara.

      At first I was very bored of the whole OVA thing. They aren&#039;t really tied to the main story that significantly so why bother?<br />
<br />
But then ... Obsession is my specialty, I had to watch the watch the OVA&#039;s of Shingeki no Kyojin, that anime was a best and you&#039;ll always miss it in the end, waiting for the next season is anticipating and I did not have patience. <br />
<br />
  It&#039;s sad but, my experience/ moments I had with AOT is slowly deteriorating, I&#039;ll soon need some recap for my head before watching the second season.<br />
<br />
 My first thought of the slow process

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185361">
        while watching Ilse&#039;s Journal(3 OVA&#039;S), was kind of boring. As for the next two OVA&#039;S(Last) I was struck in awe of the whole story. I could say the OVA: A Choice With No Regrets could have been a standing on new series by it&#039;s own. A few changes here and there and you have yourself a rock hit animation. I&#039;m just saying it could be but not saying I support it, cause it could ruin the anime. The art is of course the same as the original where it came from, still fantastic. <br />
<br />
  No Regret focuses on Levi&#039;s past and everything before he joined the Survey Corps and why. (I was shocked to that Levi had a criminal record and even more shocked was that he used to live underground before), Three friends, Isabel, Farlan and Levi make livings by stealing money as they are stuck in the Underground Capital whom the Outside throws people to suffer and die.<br />
<br />
 Though, I don&#039;t understand. Shouldn&#039;t the Underground place be a good place to hide citizens (humanity) while/ during a Titan invasion, Titans would not discover them easily am I right? <br />
<br />
  Why wouldn&#039;t people do that instead of running further into the walls. They have a really weak system plus dangerous too not to mention it. Other than the harsh conditions it seems there are lights and shelter built to live in. I don&#039;t see why it can&#039;t be a hideout. It ticks me off that people who live there want a chance to go out to live on the surface. I would say it&#039;s doing suicide for yourself. <br />
<br />
  But either way the I can kind of comprehend story is trying to avoid the Underground solution and head the plot for a massacre of humanity sacrifice so that everyone can have a turn dying. That&#039;s what people think are &quot;more interesting&quot;. I don&#039;t blame them plus the side story was a good one besides the argument I had above earlier. The idea of a Titan apocalypse is better, if it were not planned and written I would not have met Levi or any of the characters.<br />
<br />
  Let the OVA explain the rest, but the Story has a group of three with Levi as their &#039;leader&#039;. They learned to move with the 3D Maneuver Gear by themselves efficiently in a matter of practice. Their burglaries and fast skilled talents and success made them get captured by Erwin Smith and the three of them decide to join the Survey Corps to the outside. Why? Because they had a mission from Councilman Lovof which he promised they would get full citizen from the outside if they cooperate with him. They agreed.<br />
<br />
  A Choice With No Regrets was the best thing ever but I think two episodes were a little too little for a strong and prominent character like Levi, I wanted much more. It&#039;s title explains itself at the end like a hopeless flag in a sunrise horizon and the story was very touching and revengeful. Levi was kind of left nowhere to go other after his comrades went than follow Erwin and embark on their Journey, I was happy it turn that way . A part I really enjoyed was .... I squealed when Levi showed the other Survey Corps how killings are done and also the way he hold the blades had a unique feeling acted. Levi always was a child prodigy plus his extremely calm demeanor, He moved fast and is strongest of them all. You&#039;ll see more in the story that he has a good heart to begin with, it&#039;s not as visible as the others but he does have a good side to him. That&#039;s what I like about Levi. <br />
<br />
  This short story is totally worth a watch. I cannot tell you how intrigued and moved I was from this. I enjoyed every last breathe. When it was done I wanted more, oh how I can&#039;t wait to see Levi again. (Thank you Hajime Isayama, for making this story come to life.)<br />
<br />
Ok, That settles it!<br />
<br />
I&#039;m taking him as my husband no matter how old he is. hehe <br />

    Alright, since the other reviews mostly summarize what we already know, I&#039;m going to write down my thoughts on what I think works and why it did, and what I think doesn&#039;t work and why it didn&#039;t. I&#039;ll try my best to be as vague as possible to avoid spoilers, but I&#039;ll post warnings just in case. <br />
<br />
Characters: 6 out of 10 <br />
Levi is the Levi we know from the main manga and anime for the most part, plus a little more care and emotion. I can say mostly the same for Erwin, plus a little more coldness. These two are the ones who kept

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198630">
        this score up as high as it is. I think Levi&#039;s and Erwin&#039;s differences are appropriate because, in Levi&#039;s case, someone who is kinder will often be made colder after being exposed to what Levi endured, and that&#039;s what we got. Erwin is younger and slightly less mature than his main storyline counterpart, so he was realistic as well—also bear in mind that he did care more, among other things, in the Kuinaki Sentaku manga. <br />
<br />
Isabel and Farlan are mediocre characters, to put it bluntly, and are what dropped this score from an 8. Isabel is a pretty cool character who isn&#039;t the typical &quot;girly-girl&quot; we often see in anime and manga, but in a story like Shingeki no Kyojin, &quot;not a girly-girl&quot; doesn&#039;t count for much. Such a character would be more unique and do more for the story in another genre, like romance or general slice-of-life to name a couple. She&#039;s an entertaining breath of fresh air, I&#039;ll give her that, but she&#039;s not special enough to stand out beyond giving audiences something different to see and hear. Farlan was much better in the manga than in this OVA, in my opinion. He was clever and shrewd, akin to Armin and Erwin, and that intelligence gets largely skipped over here. Moreover, Armin and Erwin already exist, and so he suffers the same fate as Isabel by failing to be special enough to stand out and hold his own opposite superior characters—namely Erwin since Armin isn&#039;t here, of course. I did care a bit about these two, though. They weren&#039;t terrible by any means—just average to a little cool. <br />
<br />
Animation: 9 out of 10 <br />
Wit Studio delivers its best, and audiences will not be disappointed in the slightest. Seriously, these visuals were lovely to watch. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9 out of 10<br />
It&#039;s the Shingeki no Kyojin soundtrack, and it&#039;s great. I did think Levi&#039;s Japanese VA Kamiya overacted just a bit at the end, but it&#039;s not really an issue. <br />
<br />
Story: 5 out of 10 <br />
This OVA provided backstory and nothing more. (Backstory can be used to drastically change perspectives on present situations in a story, but nothing of the sort was done here.) I preferred the OVA featuring Ilse Langnar because it introduced new elements that changed the way we looked at Titans and at SnK world building and its culture (later confirmed in part in the main manga). Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s a fun watch despite my griping, and it&#039;s great to learn new insights about the characters we love, but this is what one could call non-sexual fanservice. Why? Because it&#039;s really just for the fans&#039; satisfaction only rather than the story&#039;s development—the SnK storyline does not absolutely need their backgrounds to progress—and frankly, the manga did it better. Catering to fans does not necessarily make the story worse per say, but it doesn&#039;t really add much value, so my score won&#039;t be that great as a result. <br />
<br />
Here is where the potential SPOILER warning comes in, and I&#039;ll try to be vague: a certain scene at the end (in which Erwin influences Levi&#039;s final decision to stay in the Survey Corps) was not done justice, in my opinion. It was glossed over quite a bit. &quot;Don&#039;t regret your decision&quot; was mentioned, but &quot;It&#039;s the Titans!&quot; from the manga was omitted entirely, making Erwin seem largely uncaring and partially dismissive of Levi&#039;s situation rather than aiding Levi&#039;s resolve and getting him to see the bigger picture. Compare that to an earlier scene that features Erwin stepping out of a carriage and giving a few dramatic lines about his resolution to do what it takes. Putting the emphasis in the wrong location, maybe? That zeal would have been much better served in the final scene with Levi, Erwin. Instead you just looked dispassionate in the end. <br />
<br />
Moreover, this OVA was pretty busy with an unnecessarily overcomplicated plot. I don&#039;t want a dumbed-down plot, just not one that tries to take on too much and show off when it isn&#039;t needed. The second episode in particular had too much ground to cover. I think that would have been aided by placing the split-off point between episodes in a different location—Levi resolving to do the &quot;job&quot; handed to him and his friends rather than at the point shown. I could get more specific, but that would result in spoilers. Perhaps three episodes would have been better, if it could be fit within a reasonable budget. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 5 out of 10<br />
As a manga adaptation, I say it was a slight disappointment. I couldn&#039;t help thinking that it certain characters and scenes were not being done justice, and that didn&#039;t help. <br />
From an anime only standpoint, I say it was a fun watch, especially for more hardcore fans, but not much else. The only wow-factor for me lay with the visuals and sound; nothing else really impressed me. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: It&#039;s a good distraction if you have some extra time on your hands, but personally if I could go back, I would have just read the Kuinaki Sentaku manga while listening to the soundtrack.

    This is probably the best content in the AOT universe, and beyond a shadow of a doubt the best OVA produced in the series. The preface, I am NOT an AOT stan, I actually dropped the show after the 1st season and didn&#039;t pick it up again till my friends started gushing about the 3rd season. I started No Regrets by mistake after clicking on the wrong hyperlink, and I&#039;m so glad I did, because No Regrets is a masterpiece in every definition of the word.<br />
<br />
Normally I list off every category, the ratings I gave it, and why, but for No Regrets it seems somewhat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370891">
        redundant cause I just set everything to 10. Let me save you some time and tell you the following:<br />
<br />
Story: Amazing, edge of my seat the entire time and never left. 10/10<br />
<br />
Art: The normal AOT art style but somewhat more realistic and refined, people and especially the titans look a lot cooler. 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound: It&#039;s AOT, what do you expect? Easy 10/10<br />
<br />
Characters: YES. Aside from Levi, Erwin, and a little bit of screen time from Hange, we have an OVA original supporting cast fighting alongside Levi and I loved their performance so much. A roller coaster of emotion. 10/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I enjoy AOT, but No Regrets takes it above and beyond. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall: I was not expecting to feel the way I felt going into this OVA, but everything just fit together so perfectly to create this 50 minute marvel of animated cinema, I am genuinely at a loss for words to describe this. I never felt like I craved for more, it ended at the exact perfect moment for it to end with impeccable timing and great overall pacing.<br />
<br />
Like AOT? No problem, same here.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t like AOT? No problem, I get that.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t like No Regrets? Big problem, we gonna fight.<br />
<br />
11/10, wish I could erase my memory and watch it all over again start to finish.

    Everybody knows Attack on Titan, but does everybody recognize Attack on Titan for what it is?<br />

Art: 8/10<br />

Production IG has improved dramatically over time, and AOT is very slick. The backgrounds are very fleshed out, and idle animations look good. The rain and fog are particularly dark feeling, and oppressive. Otherwise, solid effort on the animation front. <br />

Personal Score: Good<br />

Hiroshi Kamiya returns as Levi, Daisuke Ono appears again as Erwin Smith. Both give solid performances and bring the characters to life as the stoic Levi and commanding Erwin. The same OP and ED from the series appear, along with the weird German acoustic guitar song

Characters: 8/10<br />
----------------<br />
Particularly Levi, but also Erwin in this pair of OVAs get some needed characterization in an emotional and expository way. Levi&#039;s past as a street punk and how he came to be part of the Survey Corps is explored, along with his deep seated, cold as ice personality. His obsessive compulsive germophobia is also hilariously present. <br />
Levi becomes much more than the almost super-human titan slaying prowess he displays in the original series- he&#039;s given heart. Levi is shown to have always been a driven man, a goal oriented man- but not one without a conscience. His relationships with his friends, past relations with the army, and future relationships with the Survey Corp, and by default, Erwin Smith are all explored and fleshed out fantastically in such a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Erwin Smith appears in a limited role. He&#039;s presented as a much more steeled and uncaring man than Levi himself, hardened by the harsh realities of life outside the walls. His perceived understanding of the nature of life beyond the safety of the human settlement drives him to be a conservative and competent leader, which further settles him into his role as the Commander in AOT. <br />
<br />
Personal Score: Good<br />
<br />
---------<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
---------<br />
This time, the story has a definite beginning and definite conclusion. The audience already knows what happens beyond this- it&#039;s been detailed in the original series. What sets Birth of Levi apart as a superior OVA is how it takes important, fairly fleshed out, established characters, and turns them into something more. Captain Levi is one of the most beloved characters in AOT, and for good reason: he&#039;s good at his job, he doesn&#039;t take no shit, and he doesn&#039;t break the rules of the show. His past is explored, why he&#039;s the way he is, and how that past affects his present and future to come in the Survey Corps. Levi experiences a range of emotions and events that are formative for the character presented later on, and to great effect. <br />
<br />
Personal Score: Great<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
----------------<br />
I&#039;ll be honest: I found Birth of Levi to be _better_ than the entire first season of AOT. The original AOT could have benefited a lot from the pacing and character driven storytelling that Birth of Levi contains. There&#039;s no filler: everything serves a purpose. Levi experiences a character arc, we see him develop and change into the Levi that we know and love, and not just because the plot demands it. It&#039;s an organic change, and not one forced in for convenience.<br />
Much improved pacing (there&#039;s not a whole lot of time to work with in two 30 minute OVAs anyway!) leads the way to a fantastic standalone work within the AOT universe that&#039;s certainly a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Personal Score: Great<br />
<br />
------------<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
------------<br />
I&#039;ve been wanting to re-review Attack on Titan since I did the original, but I wanted to see an actual difference in how something with such promise could be presented in a character driven, no frills, no filler format. Birth of Levi delivered with style. <br />
<br />
Final Score: Good (41/50) = 8.2

    The ova fails both in storytelling and characterization.<br />
<br />
I liked how the first episode was set up, and how the ova gave us more background info on Isabel and Farlan, which was fine for the most part but it ended up cutting out a lot of the important scenes in favor of having more scenes with Levi in it. The ova also painted Erwin as a total asshole and made him seem like he wasn&#039;t all that interested in Levi (or in anyone really) when the literal main plot of no regrets is about his and Levi&#039;s relationship! It made me feel very lukewarm about the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334073">
        story and characters as a whole.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#039;t horrible, and I loved the fight scene with Levi and the titans at the end, but it didn&#039;t live up to my expectations of it.

    I just finished it, and i dont make many reviews. I rarely make one sinc eim not the best XD its so hard to get your feels out there! <br />
<br />
Let me start out by saying this: I finished the first season of Attack On Titan. Being how amazing it i htought the OVAS were just &quot;a little something&quot;. I watched the other OVA&#039;s but I wouldve never expected this OVA to be so good. Never. Why? Because you wouldnt expect to be bombarded with feels in only two episodes. And how terribly personal Levi&#039;s background story is, and how close you connect with it. Yup,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197154">
        this is the one and only Levi&#039;s background story. The best OVA is history.<br />
<br />
Story: 10~ SPECTACULAR! And so...creative? is that the word? Clever? In all honesty i wouldnt have expected this. People dying...of course! This is Attack on Titan! Does anyone really live more than half an episode? So it isnt really a surprise when that &quot;special someone(s)&quot; in this OVA dies. But before He/she/they/it die...its just the story that touches your heart. It starts with Levi living in poverty. And this is a type of poverty you didnt think existed in AoT. He was (With many others) so poor, they basically couldnt afford Sunlight. They had to pay a fee to get out of the underground. A village not so deep under the surface. But too expensive to get out of; So Levi resorted to being a theif. Lets just say he met some friends, and to help another friend out he had to make a big sacrifice...with no regrets.<br />
(If i said anything else it would be a spoiler!)<br />
<br />
 Art: 10~ I literally look back at all my other animes ive watched and im saying &quot;What have i been doing all my life? Plenty of Mind-boggling 3D Maneuver gear action! Shock-full of stunts! Twirls, flips. The works.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10~ I think this is one of those reviews were you think you have to score lower because EVERYTHING is a ten, but....i can&#039;t bring myself to. I was going to put sound as a 9 since there was a SMALL TINY LITTLE german singing piece that wasnt 100, but why lower the whole  two episodes for one tiny little note? New 3D Maneuver gear sounds that were interesting!<br />
<br />
Character: 10~ Obviously. Levi is pretty expressionles......but lets just say he shows some emotion here ;D I see Erwin Smith in a whole new light...a darker one. And I see Levi as much much stronger than i thought. The rest of the characters...what rest?

    &quot;Everyone saw your fight. You&#039;ve given them hope that Humans don&#039;t have to lose to the Titans if we fight correctly. It was really outstanding!&quot;<br />
<br />
Attack on Titan: No Regrets, looking back, really is integral to the plot of the first half of Season 3. It shows the growth of an early Levi in the Survey Corps and all his loss and development into Humanity&#039;s Most Powerful Soldier.<br />
<br />
Well, what can I say apart from this is near perfection in terms of visuals, storytelling and music. It gives focus to one of the more popular characters of the series and fully explores his otherwise vague backstory from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374970">
        the main show, dear god is it heart wrenching.<br />
<br />
Why it has never been officially localised I do not know since it greatly benefits the viewer going into latter seasons and explores his relationship with Commander Erwin. But overall, a fantastic two part OVA that&#039;s in desperate need of a proper release one day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have your eyes remained clouded? Humanity needs your skills Levi!&quot;

    Warning possible Spoilers<br />
<br />
Now we all know that when we saw Levi&#039;s character we fell in love immediately so the fact that an OVA was made about his origins you know we&#039;re going to be watching the hell out of it.<br />
<br />
Set a year before the events of the Colossal Titans first appearance we head to The Underground a human sanctuary below grounds, 3 people called Levi, Isabel and Farlan are tasked by a man named Nicholas Lobov to kill a man that has been a thorn in his side and that man is called Erwin Smith.  <br />
Despite being two episodes we really get to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review253564">
        the man Levi was and what he would become along with the two friends he would be fighting alongside with, it was really interesting how the strongest Survey Corps member was actually a criminal who would try and help the poor people of the Underground which shows Levi&#039;s care for human life.<br />
We also find out that even though humanity is fighting against the Titans there are still some that don&#039;t support certain decisions like where the peoples money should go like whether the expeditions should get more priority over other military branches.<br />
The journey that Levi had to take was much like everyone else a dark one as we see what he suffered from his first encounter with the Titans that made him into the blunt and approachable person that we all know.<br />
<br />
There are only 4 characters to take note of in this OVA, but despite being a small cast of characters they all do really well.<br />
Levi of course is the MC and you can definitely see he was a different man before becoming part of the Survey Corps although his desire for himself and everything else to be clean is still there, he does show more his caring side to the people around him and doesn&#039;t play well with orders and you can really see the pain on his face when he discovers the fate of his friends and the anger he presents towards the titans after seeing this is terrifying beyond anything.<br />
Isabel Magnolia is a girl that happens to run into Levi and Farlan while escaping some criminals, she is a very upbeat and fun person not really giving much of a care about her well being, but she greatly cares for her friends and has a special power that somehow makes every animal she encounters like her.<br />
Farlan Church is Levi&#039;s second hand man who is a very calm and steady person who knows when to give up, but can also be defiant against his enemies, he catches on quickly to the Survey Corps ways despite doing the solute upside down and his opinions to Levi are always taken into his own opinion which is why both of these two have respect for each other.<br />
We also get to see Erwin Smith and what he was doing before he was the commander of the Survey Corps along with some other familiar faces like Hange and Keith.<br />
<br />
The artstyle again was much like the other AoT stuff, but we got to see a new location that humanity has hidden away from the Titans threat which is the Underground and it actually looked pretty cool for underground cities true it wouldn&#039;t be nice to live there, but you can&#039;t be picky in this world.<br />
<br />
The action was well done too as we get to see why Levi is the best Survey corpsmen with the ODM Gear because his skills are goddamn good even to the point where he&#039;s able to out maneuver other Survey members, however there is still some titan fighting despite being short it was still good especially when Levi discovered his fallen friends and completely massacred the titan that killed them.<br />
<br />
Overall this was an awesome origin story and it would be a great watch for anyone who is a fan of Levi so you can get to know how he joined the Survey Corps and became the man we all love to see.

    It is an enjoyable anime that gives a glimse of one of Attack on Titan&#039;s favorite character Levi&#039;s past. I find it interesting to see how the Underground works and looks.<br />
<br />
But compared to the same OVA in manga... They gave Levi a lot of traits he does not have in the original manga, wich bother&#039;s me a lot. They also changed the story so it differs from the original, I am not a fan of that. I will even go as far as saying that I don&#039;t recognize Levi at parts of this anime, in his behavior. The manga also gives us more to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review212403">
        of what is on Levi&#039;s mind. <br />
<br />
Not a bad anime at all, just compared to the original and to the character&#039;s traits, it is not the best.

    Sometimes, gaining trust and loyalty comes with a heavy price. <br />
<br />
Levi learned it that way. The famed monstrous captain of the Special Ops of the Survey Corps had it own past to tell. When he grew up in the world where even light was scarce, he dreamed of nothing but to see the world above the ground and see how the sun shone above them. Together with his trusted friends, he had the chance yet with something in return, they have to kill Erwin Smith. A path which did not go smoothly at first... <br />
<br />
Levi&#039;s loyalty and trust on Erwin&#039;s decisions had paid lives of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245596">
        the 2 persons which meant his life. His loss for those he cared had harbored the respects Erwin deserved from him. Despite the fact that Levi had met Erwin at the crossroads because he must kill Erwin, Erwin ignored it, took the risk because he had seen the potential Levi had and his future being part of the Survey Corps. <br />
<br />
Erwin trusted the skills of a man who could crawl anytime when his guard is off and plunge a knife into his heart. He knew that Levi was beyond that-- beyond the fact that he was a thug forced to sign a contract to fulfill his desires. He knew that after all of this, Levi would follow his command. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#039;t. You&#039;ll regret it. If you begin to regret, you&#039;ll dull your future decisions and let others make your choices for you.All that&#039;s left for you then is to die.&quot; -Erwin Smith, ep. 2- <br />
<br />
This line really got me... It reflects on how a person should do after making decisions in life, whether where it would take him. For Levi fans, this a should-watch OVA... Don&#039;t miss it!

    This OVA centers around Levi and how he ended up joining the Scouts. it starts at where he lived, who his family was, and what kind of person he was before joining the military. I think that this is as good as it gets in such a short amount of time. I felt captivated by the story for the entire 50 mins. Levi is one of the coolest characters and going into his backstory was really fun and gives his character that much more depth. I understand now why he is so skilled and why he kills the titans. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give it an

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404413">
        8/10. I cannot go any higher as nothing really grand happened that blew me away but there was a really consistent, well-made plot.

    While this OVA has the same great presentation as the main series and is watchable in its own right, it falls flat in other important departments. While we do get a little more background into the underground city and Levi&#039;s past it’s not an in-depth look and felt glossed over. The two new characters introduced as part of Levi&#039;s gang are generic, doomed characters whose fate is blatantly obvious right from the start. When some familiar faces show up, they are just used to move the story along and not provide any meaningful input. This is a two-episode OVA that would have worked better as

    If there was any character to flesh out in a small OVA, it&#039;d definitely be Levi, and this pair of episodes that goes through his tough upbringing that changes to adopt himself into the Survey Corps is interesting, and something closer to being in line with the main story than the previous set of OVAs. Probably my favorite part is that the personality of Levi is still basically the same, but Erwin earns his personal respect and wants to follow him. First there are two geese that appear at the start and end of season 1 and now two doves flying at the end of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382185">
        this is a nice continuation of the motif that at least Farlan and Isabel had their time out from the underground, and that their spirits have been freed from it. Especially since there are probably few proper burials for the Survey Corps who die in the field, thinking that their spirits are put into the freedom of birds is an idea that resonates with me. I don&#039;t know if Levi not having a last name is something important but does kind of build up the myth of him, but at least he&#039;s more open during his time as a criminal. It&#039;s a good origin story that does explain how certain characters got to where they are without excessive detail over small trivia.

    &lt;Potential Spoilers&gt;<br />
It’s nice to see some more of Levi’s backstory.<br />
<br />
No regrets expands the world of Attack on Titan while also giving Levi more of the spotlight. We get to see his journey into the Survey Corp and his life prior to being a soldier. That storyline of Levi’s character combined with Attack on Titans soundtrack and Wits animation makes this OVA something else.<br />
<br />
The storyline focuses fully on Levi’s journey to becoming a soldier in the Survey Corp and his life just prior to being a soldier. No regrets, takes the time to explore life in the underground which is basically the most poverty-stricken area in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review420614">
        the walls. The OVA further builds up the world of Attack on Titan, we see the low socioeconomic regions of the world which I find interesting. The world of Attack on Titan is vast and it’s thanks to OVA’s like no regrets that the world becomes even more vast. The story also brings back some of the darker themes of season one. The idea that the world is a horrific place, the concept of sacrifice and death has a lot more emotional weight then we think. People can die at any time, an idea that is explored in season one and is brought back in this OVA. One of the best aspects of season one which is somewhat forgotten in later seasons is present in no regrets.<br />
<br />
The iconic Attack on Titan soundtrack returns in this OVA. The soundtrack always had a techno but medieval vibe to it that made the soundtrack unique and stand out from the crowd. And all the pieces of the soundtrack that are used in the OVA are instantly recognisable as a part of Attack on Titan. The music conveys both the world and the mood of any scene, whether it be intensity or sadness. The sound effects are amazing, I’ve said this many times before but the sound effects of the ODMG make every fight scene that much more intense and brutal. It also contributes to conveying the unique weapons used in fight scenes of the series. The voice performances are top tier as well, especially Hiroshi playing as Levi. He conveys the moody yet terrifying personality of Levi perfectly and even though Levi sounds emotionless, his emotions are still somewhat clear through his voice.<br />
<br />
Despite being an OVA, the animation is still just as good as the main series. The first episode had some really cool moments, seeing the ODMG gear being operated underground and not in a city was really cool. All the fight scenes are the highlights of Attack on Titans animation. Especially whenever Levi is operating the ODMG, the animation captures how powerful and strong Levi truely is and it makes every fight with him that much more intense. Characters blend well into the environment, characters movements feel realistic along with their body structure. One aspect I love of the animation is the appearance of the underground. We’ve only really seen the main districts and a few villages within the walls. So to see a whole new and interesting environment was really cool. Especially the way the houses are structured, it reminds me of some middle eastern style architecture.<br />
<br />
We’re introduced with a new that follow Levi. Featuring Isabel and Farlan. With Levi taking the main spotlight. I found it truely interesting to see Levi’s journey into the survey Corp and how he lived his life in the underground. We see a Levi that is far more forgiving and light hearted then the one we see in the series. It highlights how much being a soldier had affected his mental well-being. Because while he does have a cold exterior, he still takes Isabel in and help her heal a bird. I also like the characters of Isabel and Farlan. They both are kind hearted people that contrast from the cold atmosphere emitted from Levi, they indirectly guide Levi in how he should act nicer. My only problem is that while this is the Attack on Titan universe, I would’ve liked to see more of Isabel and Farlan. As they are truely interesting characters with lots of potential.<br />
<br />
If you want to watch something Attack on Titan related but diverges from the main narrative. I highly recommend no regrets. Levi’s story and Wits animation make this the best OVA of Attack on Titan.<br />
<br />
Overall, I rank this 7/10.
