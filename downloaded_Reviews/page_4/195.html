        on 3D CGI can be off-putting when non-mechanical objects rendered in such a style look worse than Dozle in a car accident. Additionally, the film series stumbles choppily at first before truly hitting its monumental stride. Some of the ending themes are forgettable and the music takes a while to truly match the scale and magnificence of the series proper. Certain moments regarding character relationships can feel rushed as well. However, in the face of an 18-meter behemoth of passion and glory, these issues the size of a small dent. They exist yet mean little; mere bumps and scratches in the left calf of a machine painted, oiled, and buffed with the utmost care.<br />
<br />
The character designs by legendary Gundam veteran and original mangaka Yoshikazu Yasuhiko are absolutely perfect, perfect updates on both the iconic designs of yore and the art redesigns of the manga. The expressions are the liveliest in the entire franchise, striking the perfect balance between character detail and freedom of animation of the models. As for the mechanical designs of the pre-0079 era, they work exquisitely as the prototypes and predecessors of what would become the norm of the One-Year War. The CGI work for these mechs, in particular, is nothing short of commendable, as the clunky experimental designs of the iconic mobile workers --prototypes to the iconic mobile suits-- are capitalized on tremendously. The directing of the action sequences --courtesy of franchise veterans Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and Takashi Imanishi-- is exquisite, most especially in regards to the iconic Custom Red Zaku II Char pilots. One need look no further than the spectacular opening scene in episode 1 or the battle in episode 6 to know exactly how kinetic and monumental these skirmishes are. The smoke effects work wonderfully as well, particularly in regards to the purple smoke and explosions of Federation ships and student artillery. Dare I say, if the CGI were present in the mechanical models exclusively, this would be Gundam’s visual magnum opus! It already achieves such marks from a directorial standpoint.<br />
<br />
Even more care was taken to make sure that each development of the characters, narrative, and technology, kept the integrity of the original series intact. Char’s vengefulness was built up perfectly and shown to be as innate to him as humanly possible. Seeing him in a position of power is an absolute treat, whether it be him taking down a Guntank single-handedly as a child, or beating up a spy with his fists and a spiked plank. His malicious tendencies also originated from a place that feels both human and sensible, unlike a more direct counterpart in Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader and how the Star Wars prequels attempted to do the same. Additionally, witnessing other major characters from the original series in their younger forms was particularly charming. The biggest standouts were Dozle --the lovable oaf-- and Ramba Ral, both of whom were particular highlights in Origin. Even witnessing a younger Amuro Ray was wonderful, especially when everyone’s favorite troublesome little mascot, Haro began acting like the lovable goof fans know and love. The characters brand new to Origin held up as well and worked wonderfully in their roles, particularly Ramba’s father and the man who would take care of Char and Sayla in the second episode. Every second spent with these characters is wonderful and full of the type of bittersweet pleasantness you never get in anime, especially when you are familiar with where they end up in 0079.<br />
<br />
The voice acting held up tremendously as well. Keith Silverstein did a marvelous job playing Char’s teenage and adult self, with just the type of calculated, semi-dominant, and slightly spiteful tinge that truly made up Char as a person up until the end of the original 0079. Kirk Thornton was splendid as a slightly younger but ultimately gravely Ramba Ral, and Doug Stone was splendid as his desperate, constantly stressed, and slightly deranged father. The most interesting casting choice was Mike Pollock -best known for his role as Eggman- whose performance as Char and Sayla’s caretaker, Don Teablo Mass. There are a plethora of other cast members who did wonderfully in their roles as well, such as Liam O’Brien, and other well-known VAs such as Lisa Ortiz and Patrick Seitz make great background character voices. Even Hamon’s singing in the penultimate installment --in both languages-- especially in the context of the original’s story, is as beautiful as it is soul-crushing. Everything melts into a wonderful English dub, lip-syncing issues aside.<br />
<br />
There’s a sense of love and passion Origin exudes, a marvelous sense of charisma that exemplifies the joys of cinema. It may not be as thematically rich as Thunderbolt, as visually mesmerizing as Char’s Counterattack, or as inviting as Turn A, but in many ways, this exemplifies the best of what Gundam has to offer. Even when displaying a sense of brutality synonymous with Gundam, this love letter to the franchise never stops bringing a sense of whimsy and evoke visceral emotion to the silver and digital screens. You may need to watch other installments to truly appreciate this one, but in doing so, this is your reward: the absolute pinnacle of Gundam!

    &#039;Gundam Origin&#039; is the best thing that has yet happened to the Gundam franchise. The series is so different from all the other Gundams, and so successful at what it does that it appears to be more similar to &#039;Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex&#039; and &#039;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&#039; than it is similar to other Gundams.<br />
<br />
<br />
This time around our story does NOT center around bunch of kids who fights against each others with super robots, and question their morality after falling in love with enemy kids. And when people lose their families, they do NOT get over it in mere 10 minutes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279764">
        like they do in the alternative version, the original Mobile Suit Gundam. No. This time our story centers around politics and military tactics, and comes off exactly as mature and realistic as is possible in the animated medium. However, from its core &#039;Gundam Origin&#039; is character biography. It aims to capture the life of Casval Rem Deiku in a way most similar to Sports series such as &#039;Major&#039; and &#039;Hajime no Ippo&#039;, but also close to Career series such as &#039;Glass no Kamen&#039; (actress) and &#039;Uchuu Kyoudai&#039; (astronaut). I am mentioning these 4 series because they are the only other anime I have ever seen to go as deep into character-centric story telling as &#039;Gundam Origin&#039;. I am a huge fan of this concept, and never in my life did I think I would see the 5th successful series to achieve this to be This anime. I have been blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
The details put on art and animation are insane. These six episodes took three years to make. And while this is not uncommon for OVA series at all, the team didn&#039;t exactly spend their days loitering around. This is a work of such high caliber it mainly reminds me of &#039;Hellsing Ultimate&#039;. Outside of few building scenes, there are practically no scenery that hasn&#039;t been animated. Even during debates, there are no scrolling backgrounds to make it create the illusion of animation and movement. During these scenes, almost every side character is in some way reacting to the conversations, be it in forms of expressions, habits or body gestures. It&#039;s crazy. <br />
<br />
The thing that impressed me the most is the character design, more specifically their faces. Approximately 93% of the 200something characters don&#039;t even look like anime characters. For the first time ever, I have been impressed by the animated faces of middle aged men. They have unreal amount of details, separately designed side/front profiles and realistic facial features. The faces have so much depth that it doesn&#039;t even stop there. Especially during close-ups, we can see shadows cast on their faces according to their facial features and room lighting. If this doesn&#039;t impress you then I have no idea what could. Also, for the first time since &#039;Gankutsuou&#039; has a goddamn piece of clothing burned in my very soul. I am talking about the onepiece dress seen in episode 2 at Club Eden. Talk about pretty. For the sake of readable length, I won&#039;t go further into details, but practically everything has been polished and there isn&#039;t much CGI outside episode 6. But even in the finale the CGI is so well done that less experienced viewers won&#039;t even realize they are looking at CGI.<br />
<br />
<br />
The series is, by no means, perfect. One of the side characters, Zabi Garman, can be seen as a plot element who only exists to lead the story in preferred direction. Our main character can be criticized of being a Gary Stu level Jesus who is perfect at everything and anything. Personally, I didn&#039;t find any of these factors to be actual &quot;problems&quot; that could ruin the series for me. Rather, I thought they were done well. For example, the expectations others&#039; and Garma himself put on him didn&#039;t match his personality, so it was easy for him to get played. Most of the time everything feels like it has been done with high level of self-awareness. The team behind Gundam Origin seems to be well aware of all its flaws and did their best on making it believable, acknowledging its imperfections and weaker sides. <br />
<br />
Since I haven&#039;t spoken anything about the sounds yet, I suggest you head to your closest youtube and copy-paste the following song title &quot;Crowley Hamon - Don&#039;t Say Goodbye&quot; and enjoy. I let this piece speak for itself.  <br />
<br />
<br />
When it comes to enjoyment, I can&#039;t speak on the behalf of Gundam fandom for the reason that I am not a fan of Gundam series in generally. Thus far the only ones I have really enjoyed were Vietnam, Hamburger Meat and Nice Float (08th MS Team, 0080 War in the Pocket and Unicorn - in case you are not up to date with hottest Gundam memes). I can still speak as a fan of mature anime series, as a fan of character portray, and as a fan of anime in generally. The levels of mature and realistic are -ironically- almost unrealistic, the characters are far better than anyone could expect, and the art kept constantly impressing me. I will call Gundam Origin an obligatory view for all anime fans.

    Some people think Gundam is the Japanese Star Wars. Well, we can safely say this is Episode One. I dread that newcomers to the franchise will see this OVA and judge Gundam Universal Century for it, because despite being a prequel, there is practically nothing here reminiscent of the classic show, or even most other entries. Even worse, it insults and bastardizes almost every character that the fans love. It has no reason to exist, and coming from a guy who&#039;s seen about 60-70% of all Gundam anime currently, that&#039;s immensely disappointing. Let me explain, using the prologue as a demonstration:<br />
<br />
The story immediately rushes off

          <span style="display: none;" id="review185765">
        to a sweeping space battle sequence featuring an adult Char Aznable, cleverly shown in the trailers to get fans hyped for the lovable, masked antihero. Then, after about five minutes, it ends, and we never see anything impressive like it again. Instead, we cut years into the past to Char&#039;s father hollering about the political lynching that&#039;s about to befall him. After this, he storms into his children&#039;s bedroom, where a cartoon cat shrieks in a slapstick manner and climbs up the bed post. He hugs his child, Artesia, lovingly. A minute later he&#039;s shown dying before a speech. Finally, the kids attend his funeral and scream obnoxiously at his corpse for no reason. That&#039;s the prologue, folks, killing off Char and Artesia&#039;s father, who we&#039;ve wanted to see since 1979, in three minutes! The other shows portray Zeon Deikun as an enlightened leader, so why was he shown as a raving, paranoid, messianic lunatic? Canon-concerns aside, we go from action to intrigue, then from comedy to love, and then finish it off with morbidity in a span of about ten minutes. Who directed this thing, haven&#039;t they ever heard of tone? What am I supposed to feel here?<br />
<br />
Indeed, these questions permeate the entire OVA! Every time something serious happens, the cartoon cat, Lucifer, comes and acts silly, or something with an entirely different emotion is introduced. You see, Gundam usually has either a militaristic or adventurous tone, and when Tomino is directing, it can even be jovial. This OVA tries all of these tones at the same time, ensuring the viewer never knows what emotion is trying to be conveyed, and it happens at the same breakneck pace as the prologue. Also, in the proceeding pseudo-industrial era space setting, you&#039;ll spend the next hour, completely separate from anything Gundam-related. That&#039;s right, there&#039;s no Gundam in this Gundam. There&#039;s very sparse mecha, no science to speak of, no character introspection, and no philosophical banter. There&#039;s nothing here for Gundam fans, and the fan-favorite characters are now little kids who scream a lot.<br />
<br />
You heard me, the story portrays the Deikun family as an impotent family who, by some miracle, managed to come to political power and then surround themselves with Zabi family despots, then cry when they get eaten by obligatory treachery. Their entire role in the story is to helplessly watch as the Zabis take over the outer space republic of Zeon, which of course, Gundam fans already know about. We already know the fate of Zeon. This begs the question: what&#039;s the point of this OVA&#039;s story? There isn&#039;t one. It exists solely to bastardize what could have been a much more interesting story, the story every fan already had in their imagination. At least you get to see familiar faces, though...<br />
<br />
Familiar faces without familiar souls. There are essentially only three characters because the rest of them are Zabi family one-note villains. There&#039;s Ramba Ral, Char, and Artesia. Char is present in name only; not only does Char act like a vengeful brat when in all other portrayals he acts calm, but also he tends to be extremely reckless and unrefined. Char outright says to the Zabi family that he&#039;s going to take revenge at one point in the story. He&#039;s an angry kid, but fans never wanted to see Char as an angry kid. Nobody wants to see this version of Artesia, either. She is a toddler who shrieks and sobs. However, they do get Ramba Ral right; he&#039;s the honorable military guy with a heart of gold we know from the original show, at least when the cartoon cat isn&#039;t stealing his scenes to make them more upbeat. You know, upbeat, like military mecha anime.<br />
<br />
Really, the only absolute joy of this OVA comes from the production values. The characters look great with a retro vibe, and the action scenes are done in a dynamic 3D the likes of which haven&#039;t been seen in a Gundam show before. It was exceedingly wise of the trailer to show off these action scenes, as well as to put the best one first. Of course, it is slightly jarring to go from stunning 3D action to 2D forced melodrama or misplaced comedy, but that&#039;s the issue with production budget. Musically, the soundtrack is also impressive, just check out the trailer and listen for yourself. <br />
<br />
Actually, watching the trailer is sound advice. You miss out on nothing by simply watching the trailer and saying you saw the whole OVA, first five minute action sequence aside. If you&#039;re a Gundam fan you already know what happened in this OVA, and your imagination probably fills in the gaps far better. The trailer presents the potential that was unrealized: a fiction with historical allegory, an action space opera. What we got is a confused melodrama, a glorified prequel storyboard that, like Star Wars, has no idea why its original source material gained popularity. If you&#039;re a newcomer you&#039;ll be completely lost, and none of the events will have any meaning to you. Don&#039;t fret, I am a longtime fan and they have no meaning to me either. <br />

    Like everyone else on MAL, I also enjoyed Gundam: The Origin. The CG looks great. The action set pieces are amazing. It&#039;s a series made by Gundam fans, for Gundam fans. In other words, this is fanservice done right. At the same time, I do feel it&#039;s become a tad overrated. A lot people are calling this the best Gundam series and it&#039;s really not. I might not receive many helpfuls for doing this, but I feel like I HAVE to say some of this or else I&#039;ll go insane.<br />
<br />
First we need to go into a little background. Gundam is one of anime&#039;s most beloved

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347950">
        and influential franchises. However, its sheer size and the number of different entries and alternate continuities make it a very daunting franchise to get into. Sort of like anime&#039;s Dr. Who in that regard. Where do I even start?<br />
<br />
First, we need to go back to 1979. The original Gundam started out as a glorified toy commercial for robot model kits, but was turned into a beloved classic by the sheer dedication of Yoshiyuki Tomino. Mr. Tomino is a WEIRD man whose autism power level exceeds even my own. However, he&#039;s also a creative genius. He introduced hard science fiction concepts like Lagrangian points, space colonies, and even added a layer of politics to make Gundam less of a super robot show and more of a Space Opera like the 1977 blockbuster, Star Wars. Tomino blurred the lines between Saturday morning cartoon and hard science fiction like Robert Heinlein&#039;s &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. We get so absorbed into the world of Gundam that we forget that there&#039;s zero strategic reason why mobile suits would be humanoid in shape or why the Zakus score so many kills with their karate kicks and cute little axes. <br />
<br />
Everyone assumed that Gundam was made as an anti-war drama. However, Tomino said that the series is meant to be interpreted as a metaphor for growing up. A message especially intended for the otakus that collect Gundam models. The Earth forces represent the peaceful security of childhood and the space Nazis of Zeon represent the scary world of adulthood. The New Type mutants and their psychic powers were Tomino&#039;s way of saying that people don&#039;t listen to each other and need to start doing so. When you consider that this franchise was created to sell robot toys, Tomino&#039;s messages and ambition were incredibly bold and respectable. He could have just phoned it in, but he went WAY above the call of duty to make an all time classic!<br />
<br />
After the HUGE success of the original Gundam, we reach the 2nd phase of the Gundam franchise. At this point, it&#039;s more than just a toy commercial and expectations are higher. With Zeta Gundam, Tomino expanded the politics of the original Gundam and transformed Char from a revenge obsessed, cool villain to a beloved anti-hero. The OVAs like War in the Pocket and 8th MS Team decided to go all out with the anti-war themes and make Gundam more serious. These 3 entries are generally regarded as the pinnacle of the Gundam franchise. They basically stretched it to its limits.<br />
<br />
Now we have the 3rd phase of the Gundam franchise. Shit that looks cool and tries to recapture the lightning in the bottle. This is where we get G-Gundam, Gundam Wing, Thunderbolt, Seed, and yes, Gundam: The Origin. Some people might get mad that I just compared Origin to Wing and G-Gundam, but hear me out. Was Origin trying to teach an important lesson to depressed Otaku? Was it trying to expand the character psychology of beloved characters or take Gundam to new heights as a serious political drama? HELL NO! Origin is just a feel-good handjob for Gundam fanboys that wants to celebrate how fucking cool Char is. It is EXACTLY would you would expect if Star Wars fanboys were given 200 million dollars to make a Boba Fett movie in 1996. There is a scene in Origin where Char is playing basketball for no reason and dunking on fools like he&#039;s Lebron James. Because OF COURSE Char would be able to do that! He&#039;s fucking Char!<br />
<br />
When people hear about Origin, they hear that it&#039;s the prequel to the original 1979 Gundam. This is the place where most new fans start now. Well guess what? It&#039;s not actually a prequel! Origin makes SOO many retcons that Sunrise admitted that it takes place in its own timeline! This was after fans pointed out that Origin basically torpedoes the plot of the original. An extremely important plot point in the original Gundam is the Antarctic Treaty. The reason nuclear weapons aren&#039;t a factor in Gundam is because both sides agreed to stop using them after they were massively used to devastating effect in the battle of Loum. In Origin, nuclear weapons were never used at Loum. Instead, Zeon just used their cool toys to STOMP the Federation with extremely minimal casualties. Origin includes the famous &quot;Zeon is exhausted&quot; speech from the original, but in the context of  The Origin it doesn&#039;t make any sense! Zeon WAS exhausted in the 1979 series because they won the battle of Loum at heavy cost, largely due to the use of nuclear weapons that offset Zeon&#039;s initial advantage in robotics. While Zeon won at Loum, they lost a ton of men and weren&#039;t able to keep up with the Federation&#039;s wartime production after that battle. Loum in the 1979 series was basically if the Japanese had won the battle of Midway while still losing 4 carriers. They needed it to end the war and once it didn&#039;t they were fighting a losing battle due to differences in population and manufacturing power.<br />
<br />
One bold decision that Origin made was to cover in greater detail Zeon&#039;s genocidal operation that killed half the human population. In the original series, it happened prior to the start of the series and the casualties are kind of vague. Origin leaves no doubt that Gihren Zabi is the most pants on head insane, evil bastard in human history. His own father calls him &quot;a grotesque parody of Adolf Hitler&quot;. There&#039;s a dramatic scene where Ramba Rall quits the Zeon army after witnessing the sheer depravity of Zeon&#039;s plans. So I guess his fight with Amuro never happened in the Origin timeline, which creates its own string of issues. My point is that Origin directly draws attention to one of the biggest issues in Gundam. Zeon&#039;s leader is SO insane and unbelievably evil that it becomes a joke to portray any Zeon soldier sympathetically. Any person with any shred of human decency would defect or lay down arms after the unprovoked slaughter of 5 billion people! Most of the Zeon colonists still had relatives on Earth. There wasn&#039;t enough time for their society to see everyone outside of Zeon as completely sub-human and ingrain this ideology in every single one of them!<br />
<br />
Do you know what Origin REALLY wanted to focus on though? How cool Char is! We don&#039;t actually learn anything new about Char. He&#039;s a man who sold his soul for revenge against the Zabi family. He fights for evil in order to eventually claim revenge on the people that killed his father. Oh and then he fights for the independence of Space people...then he just cares about his pissing contest with Amuro...then he wants to kill the Zabis again. Simply put, Char has never been a perfect character even before Tomino ruined him with Char&#039;s Counter-Attack. So why do we like Char? Because he looks cool! He kills all his opponents with ease while making snarky remarks. He outsmarts his enemies, backstabs his allies, and scores with all the ladies. Char is a male power fantasy that embodies how we would like to see ourselves. He&#039;s confident. He&#039;s in charge. He&#039;s fucking BADASS! Even Tomino soon realized that he loved Char WAY more than the hero Amuro and started thinking about sexy new girlfriends for Char. According to Tomino, it&#039;s very important that we ALL know how often Char gets his dick wet. Origin takes this Char worship to the laughable degree you would expect. Char is Japanese Boba Fett meets James Bond meets Conan the Destroyer. Personally, I think Gundam is at its best when it&#039;s tackling themes or challenging us emotionally like War in the Pocket. I don&#039;t JUST want to jerk off to Char all the time!<br />
<br />
So where does this leave us? If you&#039;re a Gundam fan, I would still highly recommend that you watch Origin. It&#039;s very fun and it looks spectacular! I&#039;ll happily add this to my extended favorites, where it can hang out with Wing and G Gundam. I didn&#039;t write this review to say that I dislike Origin! However, I just read a review that Origin transcends the other Gundam series and is more like Galactic Heroes than a mere Gundam! This frankly just makes me laugh. Origin is not this 300 IQ masterpiece that just shits on all the other Gundam series. It&#039;s a very enjoyable, good Gundam series that has become a little too overrated IMO. Still recommended!

    There&#039;s a lot I feel about Origin I. I&#039;ll try my best to word it out smoothly. There will be spoilers and I won&#039;t feel bad if you bothered to read this. I hope that if you watched this movie you have the whole of 0079 as background information or you&#039;re really stupid.<br />
<br />
Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin. The very side story of Gundam that tells us how the brilliance that is 0079 started out. In its first installation, we are introduced to the era of Zeon Zum Deikum; The Principality of Zeon&#039;s forefather and the events that Put the Zabi family in his position. Zeon&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181434">
        Children, Artesia and Casval, get dragged into his mess and thus begins a chronicle of smuggling royal kids out of Zabi paws.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Characters: 8<br />
The first movie&#039;s story to be fair is kinda simple; Munzo&#039;s ruler gets assassinated by his power-hungry right hand man, his left hand man is framed for it and thus begins Zabi&#039;s successful attempt at complete throne-usurping of the Republic of Munzo; but the only things standing in the way are Zeon&#039;s descendants; Casval Rem Deikum and Artesia Som Deikum. More of the former and less of the latter. With the aid of left-hand man Ral&#039;s son, Captain Ramba and his associates, Casval and Artesia escape the clutches of the Zabi and thus possible elimination. There are sacrifices in the meanwhile, but I don&#039;t want to spoil too much.<br />
<br />
The pieces of the story seem really out of place initially what with the fleet battle in the beginning. Don&#039;t be fooled; that&#039;s a mere snippet of the events to come. The focus is in U.C 68, where we&#039;re exposed to Casval&#039;s childhood. As with the title &quot;Blue-Eyed Casval&quot;, the story focuses on young Casval and does it paint his character well? HELL YEAH. This doesn&#039;t mean they ditch every single other character though. Every other character was positioned as a stepping stone of Casval&#039;s life and they really establish the story as what it is; building the blue pillars of the red comet.<br />
<br />
But can we be fair for a bit? I&#039;m sure many movie/anime junkies are able to find a handful of tropes and cliches within the movie and the characters; this use of story and character traits are what keep it form the perfect 10. Is it really that bad to be making use of cliches? It&#039;s understandably what Gundam does, but it&#039;s not in the way that it pioneers tropes; it&#039;s taking others success instead of making others&#039; works a success. That&#039;s the 2 point difference from perfection for Origin.<br />
<br />
Art and Sound:10 and 9 accordingly<br />
<br />
 I&#039;m not going to be really detailed around here. The art is what you see in Aldnoah Zero except the CG and what&#039;s hand-drawn is (actually) good AYYYYYYYYYY<br />
<br />
So what&#039;s another good parallel? Space battleship Yamato 2199. Great CG infused with great art that mixes reeeeeeaaaaaaaally well.<br />
They managed to integrate character and GIANT CG TANKS OF MASS DESTRUCTION SPACE SHIP GIANT ROBOT really well I can&#039;t actually fully describe it.<br />
<br />
The music is really soft-spoken in this  movie and it really makes you pay more attention to the character dialogue (Yes, I didn&#039;t actually need subtitles.). Not sure if this was intended but it was a good call. Paying closer attention to the music, I find most of it slow-paced compared to the faster music scene Gundam is known for. (SEED, X, Wing, AGE, Unicorn even) is this bad? Haha no. It&#039;s a really great change of pace (albeit a really badly placed one considering how the CG made battles even more fast paced).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10. This is pretty biased since it&#039;s a Gundam movie and I&#039;m a huge nerd ayyyyyyy<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10  The one thing that prevented this from a 10/10 was how it really ruined the Universal Century Canon for me: it was established that Zeon Zum Deikum founded the Republic of Zeon before he died but in the movie you saw Zeon passing away before you saw Zeon&#039;s insignia and it just took at 1 point away from me. Idk it could have been 10/10 but since I&#039;m a huge nerd it doesn&#039;t get the privilege how ironic mirite

    I am likely different that most who decided to watch this ova in that this is the first Gundam series I&#039;ve ever seen. I&#039;d heard of it a number of times, but with so many different shows within the overall series, I had no idea where to start, and really no motivation to. However, I&#039;d heard good things about this, and with it being an origin story, I figured I&#039;d give the first OVA a try. And I have to say, it did not disappoint. Keep in mind for this review, I&#039;ve only seen the first OVA, when I watch more I&#039;ll update this review.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181980">
        story itself isn&#039;t anything overly complex. There&#039;s a lot of political intrigue, with different families vying for power, and some murders to go along with this. It took a little bit of time to figure out who was who, but 15 minutes in and I had a pretty good idea. They didn&#039;t slow down the story to give lots of explanations, but didn&#039;t try to do so much here that it needed tons of explanations, and considering they only have 4 OVAs to tell the story they want to, this pace was good. There weren&#039;t any big surprises, but there was a lot of tension throughout the story. The opening battle was also a great way to introduce the story, and it looked wonderful even though I didn&#039;t really know what was going on. The show was also able to pull on my heartstrings with the bonds between the family as I saw the love they had for each other, even the family cat. It was these emotional moments that brought everything together, and made me want to see what was going to happen to the characters. <br />
<br />
What really made the show stand out for me were the characters. While the show does jump around, the focus is on Casvel, a young boy, but a very determined and strong character. His desire to get what he wants is really great to see, and makes him a protagonist worth rooting for, and one that I know will be an awesome character as we get further with this story, heck, he&#039;s already had some awesome moments facing down powerful enemies. Artesia is his younger sister, and has much simpler desires, which really serves as a great contrast. All the other side characters are instantly likable with the way they&#039;re fighting for what they want, though some are certainly more noble than others. They haven&#039;t gotten much devlopment yet, but even without this they still really help to push the story forward, and I&#039;m guessing we&#039;ll get to see them grow through the rest of these OVAs<br />
<br />
The artwork was pretty good. The battle in the beginning was great, but that was the only really notable part. Still, there weren&#039;t any moments where the art was bad, and the style felt like the older shows, so quite fitting for Gundum. The only part of the soundtrack I can remember is the song at the end, which really did a good job of wrapping everything up, but the rest of the music was forgettable, though once again it did its job of accenting the story.<br />
<br />
Overall, this was a fantastic start. We have a well paced gripping story, with a lot of very likable characters. The few flaws here are minor enough to not get in the way of the story. I&#039;m looking forward to more of this one.

    Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin/機動戦士ガンダムTHE ORIGIN Review<br />
<br />
<br />
Story (10/10) Masterpiece <br />
<br />
The main purpose of Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin is to setup the origin story to not just the Gundam but the entire Universal Century&#039;s story and all of the characters, protagonists and antagonist that play major roles in the 1979&#039;s original Gundam anime which kickstarts the whole Gundam franchise in the first place. With that being said this 6 episode OVA I felt did a wonderful job at introducing the whole of Universal Century to the viewer. But obviously coming from myself a person who is already quite knowledgeable to the universe damn near every

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280226">
        character that was introduced I already knew about and just getting more backstory on them is just a treat for someone and people like me. As far as it&#039;s pacing, explanation and plot I thought everything was perfectly executed considering this as an Origin Story to the lore of UC Gundam I felt nothing important was left unexplained your typical origin story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Animation (10/10) Outstanding<br />
<br />
The artstyle approach taken in Mobile Suit Gundam Origin is one that is quite reminiscent to the old school artstyle of yesteryear. It definitely showcases that this art style definitely (at least to me) still has it&#039;s own charm to it in the modern day of today&#039;s frequent and quite similar art style we see across many popular anime series. The animation smooth and crisp across every scene and at first and definitely around episode 3 or 4 we get to see a decent amount of CG that is used on Mobile Suits, Space crafts and other machinery. At first I was not too fond to it but by the end of episode 6, I&#039;m not going to lie this is some of the best CG I&#039;ve seen to be put forth on a series that includes it on mechs especially basically every scene that has the Red Zaku in it, if CG is done it should be done like this.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Sound (10/10) Superb <br />
<br />
The sound effects, background music and (english dubb) voice acting you and can definitely tell (especially if you are a fan of Gundam and English Dub voice acting) was treated with the utmost care. Keith Silverstein (who also voiced Full Frontal) can do the most ambitious, passionate and most charismatic Char Azanable voice you will hear amongst the many different english voice actors that have done him in the past, by far my favorite thus far and I hope he voices him from hear on out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (10/10) Outstanding <br />
<br />
The amount of characterization and backstory care we are given to many key characters of the original Gundam series is outstanding especially Casval Rem Deikun. Characters I cared not for because to be honest they get introduced and killed in the original series so quick that you don&#039;t really have a chance to know who these people are, are given great backstories that should make a newcomer care a bit for them before they most likely bit the dust in the original series. Many of those characters you get to understand their ambitions and motives through these 6 episodes than you ever did in the original and I fairly enjoyed it and thought it was handled perfectly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10) Superb <br />
<br />
As a Gundam fan I had a fucking blast with The Origin. As a newcomer I can see if one might think that this could be a bit too much of an info dump to the Universe since it may feel like this Origin story wants you to remember all of these many key characters that will definitely appear in the original Gundam series. That might be where a newcomer might be overwhelmed and turned off especially since there is no actual presence of the Gundam in this Origin story even though that is the name of the OVA. One could also say they were better off calling it Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin of Universal Century as that can be read as a more accurate representation to what is present in this OVA, this could easily hinder a newcomer&#039;s enjoyment and I completely understand if it did. Some might even say it might be better to watch the original series and then go back and watch this, but I feel if you are someone who can get ahold of majority of what this origin story brings to the table it will serve as a great introduction into a great space war story.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10) Masterpiece <br />
<br />
Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin I feel accomplishes what I think it was trying to do and that is setting up the Universal Century&#039;s lore perfectly. I honestly hope they decide to make a remake of 0079 Gundam using this OVA&#039;s animation, artsytle and voice actors. But I&#039;m not too sure seeing as though they seem to be working on another Unicorn Gundam Anime and then a Hathaway&#039;s Flash anime which are both welcomed but were not asked for as much as a 0079 remake (or hell Crossbone!).<br />
 <br />
If you are a returning fan of Gundam you should be most pleased <br />
If you are a newcomer you better pay attention because their a lot this OVA demands you.

As far as how it adapts the story, it does a very good job adapting the prequel story-pieces of the manga adaptation, &quot;The Origin,&quot; and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has seen the original series, especially if they&#039;re about to re-watch it.  <br />
<br />
If you consider the early-UC timeline to be &quot;The Story of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable,&quot; then this sets the stage perfectly: It takes you from &quot;before their time,&quot; through their childhood and adolescence, and finishes you off perfectly with all of the main players taking their places

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279978">
        for the beginning of the first episode of the original series.  It definitely focuses more on Char than it does on Amuro, but, looking at the early-UC timeline, Char IS the character whose story affects the world the most while his past is the one least explained.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll put it bluntly: the animation flips back and forth between &quot;cheap horseshit&quot; and &quot;a little bit more than above average,&quot; and that definitely detracted from it.  If none of the CGI had been used (or if any actual effort had been put into the CGI), then this would not have been anywhere near as big of an issue.  It&#039;s embarrassing that something that was supposed to be this huge production ended up with scenes that looked as bad as this did.  <br />
<br />
The sound design, on the other hand, is absolute perfection -- It&#039;s everything I could&#039;ve wanted.  The Japanese voice acting was what it was, to be expected, and the English dub was pretty good, though I would&#039;ve liked it more if more of the original series cast had been brought back (especially for Amuro, Char, and Bright).<br />
<br />
Like I said: If you&#039;ve seen the original series, watch this, especially if you&#039;re about to re-watch it.  But do NOT watch this before watching the original series.

    So first thing&#039;s first. I&#039;ve seen some incredible (art-wise) space-based battles in anime: the battle in the last episode of Macross Frontier, the fleet engagement near Pluto in the opening scenes of Yamato 2199, and the battle between Kshatriya and the grunt suits in the first episode of Unicorn. The Battle of Loum, something that&#039;s only been depicted once before, has always been the one Gundam battle i had always wanted to see, both for its reputed bloodiness and  for being the battle that earned Char his Red Comet nickname. This depiction did not disappoint, being right up there with the rest of them.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review181461">
        Well animated and well put together.  <br />
Story, 10: Char&#039;s background. The man&#039;s in the top 5 if not the greatest character in anime history. Understanding what makes him tick is essential to understanding the later plot of the main anime, from the original to Char&#039;s Counterattack. <br />
Art, 8: Aside from Loum in the beginning, the rest of the art was more or less on par with what I&#039;d expect for an OVA with its budget. <br />
Sound, 8: Doesn&#039;t add to or take away from the story, so 8.<br />
Character, 10: It&#039;s Char. However, they also take pains to give background to some minor characters from the original series and depict four others who have a fairly large effect on the overall proceedings in the future but have never been depicted before. <br />
Enjoyment, 9: I think some of the slapstick humor somewhat takes away from the overall tone of the story, but it also serves to give extra depth to one character in particular, Ramba Ral. Otherwise, an enjoyable romp through the streets of the principality of Zeon, that while you know who will survive and who won&#039;t, still provides somewhat of a measure of suspense.<br />
Final thoughts: Jimba Ral. I don&#039;t know what to make of him. Either he&#039;s clinically insane, or the writers made a bad mistake by portraying him the way he&#039;s portrayed. If it&#039;s the latter then it adds more to Char&#039;s character as he sees the man as a father figure, and thus provides insight into his own mental state.

    Gundam Origin to me is close to being a perfect prequel. Before someone gets up in their arms about Origin technically coming from a manga that’s a full on retelling of the MGS 0079 story and therefore being more of a spin-off than a prequel, I think they decided to cut it off before the events of the TV show because that’s where some more noticeable deviations start. However prior to that it roots itself strongly in the material people already know with only minor deviations that in my opinion don’t undermine what it adds to the universe.<br />
As such, in this review I’ll treat it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295033">
        as a proper prequel rather than AU or a spin-off.<br />
<br />
Origin opens up with a in the familiar 0079 with a few minutes long space battle where Zeon mobile suits completely dominate over EF spaceships, that’s the Battle of Loum an important point in One Year War which led to signing of the Antarctic Treaty, Char making a name for himself as a fearsome MS pilot and Zeon gaining tremendous momentum over Earth Federation.<br />
However after the few minutes of explosive action we get to what this OVA really is about. Origin takes the viewer over a decade back in time, to 0068 when tensions just started to escalate to tell a more thorough story of how everything happened and how the characters we know from the original TV became the way we know them.<br />
<br />
First episode heavily focuses on the setup, starting with the death of Zeon Zum Deikun right before he was to declare independence of space colonies. This sets off a turmoil, people who have seen the original show know how this will turn out but its nonetheless engaging to see the different political forces pull their strings to take advantage of the situation. From the get-go it’s an incredibly dense narrative that despite very coherent and simple presentation manages to interweave many elements together that start building up on top of each other.<br />
<br />
Zabi family in particular gets an incredible re-introduction that establishes the personality and goals of all of its members and while they weren’t exactly one-dimensionally evil in the TV show, I feel like Origin goes an extra step to make sure you understand what drives their actions. This applies to many other characters present in the OVA, as you get to know and understand them it helps to add some nuance to their many interactions later on, cause you know why they do the things they do without it having to be explicitly stated. There’s great many examples of this to go through but one of them is Gihren trying to stop the development of Zeon mobile suit his brother tried to keep secret. He doesn’t go too much as to why but since you understand the man if very focused on the colonies being superior he doesn’t want any resources going towards a futile effort. He points out a critical flaw of these mechs and is about to leave before Minovsky himself assures him that the he’s not the first one to notice the said flaw and that it will be fixed in the future prototypes. After realizing what mobile suits are capable of, Gihren lets the project continue but with a deadline that coincides with the start of the conflict Gihren felt coming<br />
<br />
The real star of the show is Char (Casval doesn’t stick as well) however, even if it’s hard to overstate how much Origin does to build up the characters and the world. We get to see his journey pretty much all the way through. From his harsh childhood where his hate towards Zabis took root, to his teenage years showing how became to adept at pretty much everything he does to his more or less adult years when the Battle of Loum took place. I have to admit here Char often comes off way too capable for his years but that might just be in contrast to what you’d expect from a normal person. Origin doesn’t forget to hint that Char is a newtype so multiple scenes throughout the OVA remind us of his supernatural and at times superhuman capabilities when he removes limiters from his mobile suit in spite of that being way too taxing on human body or scares people shitless just by looking at them. While first episode is mostly the establishing the whole premise. Episode 2 and most of Episode 3 give major focus to all of this until the scale starts rising at the end of Episode 3 and transitioning to the beginning of war in Episode 4 that is divided between many different perspectives.<br />
<br />
[Warning - some gravitational spoilers in this paragraph]<br />
Final two episodes are a climax of the show in more ways than one. First of all it covers some of the most impactful events in UC timeline but more than that it also gets us closer to people participating in it. Original show already does a good job of presenting them in a way that feels like you’re watching a historical documentary of sorts but Origin also helps you feel for the people that took part in it. Colony drop in particular is given much more attention than I think it ever did. Before their final moments we get to actually get a look at the hopeful people of Hatte colony, evacuating to their shelters without realizing that the mobile suits outside are preparing to pump lethal gas into their colony and then use it as a weapon against Earth Federation, leading to yet more tragic events. Within Zeon we get to see the multitude of reactions such event caused. From Dozle trying not to lose his mind by trying to rationalize the horror he just committed to Gihren almost giddy with zeal thinking of the how hard of a blow his plan dealt to the Earth Federation. <br />
<br />
Even on a personal scale episode five has a few smacks in the face (in a good way) when we revisit the Eden club shown in earlier episodes as a small but comfy underground bar where everyone can enjoy some alcohol and music away from the tension of the world happening outside. Yet in episode 5 it’s empty. The few people still there packing up cause they were drafted in the war and Hamon sings there for the last time, the song appropriately titled “Don’t say Goodbye”. Not for a bar full of happy, drunken patrons but for nearly empty room with only two other people in it. One is Ramba Ral, laying in a couch, possibly reflecting on all the terrible things that he saw and all the things that yet to happen and Tachi O’Hara now working for Zeon intelligence but previously a peppy lieutenant helping out as a bouncer for the club cause he was in love with Hamon. Just moments after this the episode goes to show the Battle of Loum to cap off with this tragic episode with an appropriate highlight.<br />
<br />
Episode 6 after this climax feels more like a wind down. What’s going to happen is not exactly unpredictable if still engaging and even though there’s not too many new developments you instead get to see how all the lines that has been going on since episode 1 or being added as the story went along tie together nicely to leave on a bittersweet ending of the kids who we’ll see later fighting on the White Base and a title card “And now, Gundam begins…”.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish I could go on and on about many things I think the narrative of Origin gets right but then this would be less of a review and more of a masturbation diary entry.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the more technical aspects this OVA isn’t a slouch either. Animation is spectacular throughout. I don’t know the particulars behind it but it feels like Sunrise dumped some blood diamonds into production or just allowed the staff to have their time but there’s a consistent, high quality animation throughout the show. I think most people are used by now that scenes without some flashy action or specific need for expressive movement like skating or dancing will look relatively cheap and just show characters flapping their mouth with occasionally doing so from a different angle but Origin says fuck this and gives almost every scene a lot of love. What that means is that people talking will have them actually behave like people and accentuate their speech with body language and facial expressions and director won’t have to try to think of clever work around to excuse cheap production like in 70s when people played magic tricks with reused footage or shaking stills. As such I don’t think there are many moments throughout the Origin that feel like a drag, there’s always something for you to look at instead of just reading the subs, or, if you’re a remote mountain hermit that actually took the time to learn Japanese, listening to characters talk.<br />
To many mecha fans, or at least old school mecha fans it will likely be a red flag to hear that mech action in Origin resorts to using CG. If you can&#039;t accept that in any form then I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;ll probably be disappointed with this decision but if you can accept CG as long as it&#039;s done well there&#039;s some bombastic stuff waiting for you here. If you want to check out the level of CG mech action in this show all you need to do is check out literally first few minutes of the first episode. Personally I think they did a great job as it doesn&#039;t feel jarring when you see 2D and 3D come together, let alone when you get to see the space battles. The models are well made and shading applied to them gives them a more cartoony look instead of shooting for realism which normally just leads to the animation aging poorly. The camerawork during 3D scenes takes full advantage of that so you get to see movement that does a great job of capturing both the chaos, scale and impact of mech combat. The only weak point to me are the occasional explosions that look a bit too rough around the edges but aside from that it does everything to do the action justice. There&#039;s no dumb attempts to recreate the framerate of 2D animation that makes everything look choppy and there&#039;s no clunky animations that make it look less like a fight between two war machines and more like some invisible kid smashing his plastic models together. So, as long as you can accept some 3D in your anime I think you&#039;ll be pleased.<br />
<br />
<br />
What adds to that is excellent pacing. Shows with a lot of talking tend to drag and shows with aim to adapt a lot of content tend to rush through things. I’m happy to say that Origin suffers from neither. It feels like there’s always a very neat and proper structure to every scene, nothing stays on the screen for any longer than it needs to for you to take in the information and the switches of perspective and locations never feel jarring or random. It’s all natural and seamless to a point where hour long episodes go by in a flash. <br />
Music and sound are well done too. It’s a mix of old and new compositions perfectly used to both underline the tone and mood of the scenes they’re used for but also add another layer to it, possibly only for people who have seen the original. When you watch all these characters and locations when the music from 0079 comes on and you hear the classic sound effects it just feels so right.<br />
Can’t say that about some of the voice acting however. While the performances are still stellar you can definitely feel that there was a large time gap between when these characters first got their voices and when Origin came out. For example I think teenage Char sounds a bit too old for how he looks and you can feel that Amuro’s VA aged quite a bit too even though he does a stellar job of trying to sound the way he should. This isn’t a problem with the characters that are already adults but yeah, when it comes to younger generations I was taken out of the show for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Overall, as I said, Origin is a nearly perfect prequel. There are some deviations from the show that I’m sure someone can summarize better than I could but I’d strongly argue that wast majority of what is shown to you is a perfect tie for what you will or already saw in the original TV show. I saw a question pop up at times whether you should watch this first or the TV show and honestly I think both work just fine. If you watch this first it will add a lot to your experience when watching the continuation but if you already seen the original there is a sense of dramatic irony to this whole prequel that when couples with attachment to the characters can make fore a more emotionally resonant ride.

    Before I get to the review, I&#039;ll have you know that I have not yet read the manga yet. I may have read it, but not when I wrote this review. <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The story is amazing. It shows how actions can be consequential. The Origin is also good at showing how much the early stages of war affect people. Most of the time in Gundam, we start while the war is at its midpoint, but here we see the very beginning and it is terrifying, with denial, paranoia and overall terror running through. This is not a very happy story to say the least.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review337012">
        The only problem I have with the story is that although I liked much of the jokes, they&#039;re sometimes too much. That&#039;s just a nitpick. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10 <br />
<br />
Everything, from the landscapes, to the movement, to the CGI… it all looks amazing in my eyes. It looks just as good as, dare I say it, Gundam Unicorn. The characters from the original Gundam have been upgraded from late-70&#039;s cel animation to 2010&#039;s digital ink and paint. The mobile suits look amazing in CGI. Usually, Anime CGI makes everything feel weightless, but you can feel the mobile suits&#039; speed and versatility in The Origin. The Zaku is probably my favorite mobile suit and the redesign makes it look epic. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really damn good. I noticed a couple of remixes of the first Gundam&#039;s OST, but even the new songs are no slouch either. The Endings are also all great, with my favorites being “Uchuu No Kanata De” and “Hasen No Namida”. I watched the dub and they did a great damn job at it. Despite liking Michael Kospa and Steve Blum as the English voice of Char Aznable, Keith Silverstein seems to be growing on me. Everyone else did great. <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The main focus on The Origin is Casval Rem Deikun and Artesia Som Deikun, better known as Char Aznable and Sayla Mass. At first, I was afraid that they were going to make Char too sympathetic, but they didn&#039;t. Char is the same paranoid, sociopathic, manipulative bastard we see in MSG proper, in fact he may even be worse than in MSG, betraying people who legitimately knew of his true goals and wanted to help him. That is what I like about Char. Sayla by contrast goes through hardship after hardship, yet it ultimately allows her to become the person she was in MSG. Plus, she’s just plain adorable at points. The rest of the cast is pretty good. Dozle Zabi in particular gets a lot of extra scenes that help flesh him out, now being an adorable teddy bear whenever he isn’t in combat. Also, his marriage proposal was hilarious. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 <br />
<br />
The Origin is a love letter to Gundam fans and one of my favorite Gundams. It has war, politics, character arcs, Char Aznable, and of course, mecha battles. If you haven&#039;t seen the UC Timeline, DO NOT START WITH THE ORIGIN. It spoils the original Gundam. Watch the Movie Trilogy first. <br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10

    Alright! This series was my introduction to Gundam, as recommended by many people. Before watching this I had no view or idea of what Gundam was and what was in store for me. I am happy to say I am overjoyed after watching this. The animation and everything was amazing and very enjoyable. I can say after viewing this OVA I am now a fan of Gundam. I am very impressed with the OVA&#039;s ability to capture the viewer, and make me go,&quot; Whoa!&quot; I found myself quickly becoming attached to the cast and caring about what happens next and what is planned to happen.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336278">
        The awesomeness of Gundam is captured excellently with this series and I would recommend watching this to any anime fan!

    You know, this franchise really likes to retell the story of the OYW. I’m serious, there are so many reimaginings, retellings and side stories that it’s ridiculous. Perhaps the most infamous one is Tomino’s MSG Novel Trilogy, which I’ll get around to reading at some point. The most famous for good reasons, however, has to be Gundam The Origin. A 24 Volume Manga by Yasuhiko Yoshikazu the retells the whole original series while adding a shit load of new content to it. While I have been planning to read it, lack of accessibility has prevented me from doing so; however I will read it as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review310048">
        soon as I get the chance. That said, we’re here to talk about an OVA Series that covers a whole flashback arc exclusive to this Manga. So, let’s get into this.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
As stated before, I have not read the original Manga, so I am not aware of what changes were made. The only ones I am aware of are ones that impact the whole Manga, as it makes a couple of retcons that make it so this OVA doesn’t mesh as fluidly with the original series. Either way, by its conception alone, this story is an interesting one. It tells the story of the events that led to the original series, primarily told from the perspective of Char and Sayla (Though Amuro does get some focus in the show’s second half).<br />
<br />
In turn, this ends up giving the OVA a damn large scale. We see the conflict slowly escalate from all sides, showing that actions that before might have seen unjustified and cruel now come across as more sympathetic and logical. A prime example being the death of Zeon Zum Deikun, as the way the story is framed very much shows him as being borderline delusional and overconfident, so Degwin killing him comes across as a more logical choice in the end.<br />
<br />
The OVA is also good at showing how much the early stages of war affect people. Most of the time in Gundam, we start while the war is at its midpoint, but here we see the very beginning and it is terrifying, with denial, paranoia and overall terror running through. This is not a very happy story to say the least. Yet it ironically ends on a hopeful note, as all the chess pieces have come to their proper places, and it is time for a counterattack.<br />
<br />
The OVA isn’t perfect though, with most of its issues being centered in the comedy. Don’t get me wrong, this the humor is really funny and it did get a chuckle out of me (I particularly loved how Dozle Zabi’s boisterous manliness terrified his baby daughter and Ramba Ral having the fight of his life trying to catch baby Artesia’s pet cat) but the problem is that it is a tad over-the-top for the story they are trying to tell. Still though, it’s mostly a nitpick on my part.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As stated before, Char and Sayla get the most focus. I was at first afraid that they’d make Char a bit too sympathetic, but they thankfully did not. Char is clearly the same paranoid, Sociopathic, manipulative bastard we see in MSG proper, in fact he may even be worse than in MSG, betraying people who legitimately knew of his true goals and wanted to help him. Sayla by contrast goes through hardship after hardship, yet it ultimately allows her to become the person she was in MSG. Plus, she’s just plain adorable at points. And people wonder why I think she’s Best Girl.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast is pretty good. Dozle Zabi in particular gets a lot of extra scenes that help flesh him out, now being an adorable teddy bear whenever he isn’t in combat. Also, his marriage proposal was hilarious. Beside him, it was also nice to see all of the rest of the main cast of MSG, even if it’s them before they had all their character development, so they can be a bit bratty at times, especially Amuro.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
This OVA looks fantastic. Everything, from the landscapes, to the movement, to the CGI… it all looks amazing in my eyes. That said; I hesitate to say it looks better than Unicorn, and it mostly has to do with the character designs. Unlike with, say, the new scenes from the Zeta Compilation movies and Unicorn, which had character designs that, while recognizably from the UC, looked more updated, this is what happens when you take those old designs and directly port them to modern animation. Combined with the ultra-bright color scheme, while I can’t say they look bad or anything, but it isn’t an art style that particularly appeals to me.<br />
<br />
No Mecha section as I already said all that needs to be said in my 0079 review. Moving on!<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is really damn good. I noticed a couple of remixes of old songs, but even the new songs are no slouch either. The Endings are also all great, with my favorites being “Uchuu No Kanata De” and “Hasen No Namida”.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Likely as a result of how old the original cast had gotten, only Ikeda Shuichi, Furuya Tooru, Furukawa Toshio and Ginga Banjo return (Not counting Narita Ken who reprises his role as Bright from Unicorn). Even then, this new cast is nothing to scoff at, with everyone doing a damn good job. Special props to Han Megumi, Sayla’s new voice (Ironic given that her mum is Han Keiko, Lalah’s old actress), who did a particularly good job. Beside them, there’s also Kakihara Tetsuya, Sawashiro Miyuki, Miyake Kenta, Arai Satomi, Seki Toshihiko, Watanabe Akeno, Yamazaki Takumi and of course, the greatest casting gag ever: Tanaka Mayumi as child Char! NICE!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Really, what else is there to say about this OVA? It is a fantastic prequel, and one I have no issue recommending. I can’t really recommend it if you haven’t seen MSG as it spoils most of its big twists, but once you do so, feel free to hop right in. Needless to say, it is a must see for all Gundam fans, whether they’re new or old.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 9/10

    Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin III: Dawn of Rebellion marks a new path of vengeance for Casval Rem Deikun and his transformation into Char Aznable. As Gundam fans know this rebellion sparked the start of the One Year War, which will become the largest tragedy in the Gundam.<br />
<br />
Watch my unboxing at http://www.popcultreviews.com/anime/mobile-suit-gundam-origin-iii-unboxingreview/<br />
<br />
The prequel itself is extremely gripping, and draws you in all the way through. That’s probably partly due to the fact that fans know where the story is going, but more importantly The Origin prequel is the perfect spot for new fans to start watching. On top of that the thing I really appreciate

          <span style="display: none;" id="review220693">
        in this prequel is that you finally get to see things from Char’s point of view and how his experiences changed him into the character fans know from the original series. It’s almost like we are seeing a close and personal view of the character just like it was the first time. As a bonus, both the English dub and original Japanese voice actors deliver a top notch performance that is sure to leave an impression. Furthermore, I love all the detail that was put into the animation. Each frame looks like perfection, so when it comes down to the wait between episodes; it was well worth it. The bottom line is that this is a must watch for all fans new and old.

    Welcome to my third review. After the first 2 I am finally giving a review to something outstanding. This review is about the ONA &#039;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&#039;.<br />
MSG: Origin is animated by the well-known studio Sunrise who have been very successful with the Gintama series and Gundam series which this ONA is part of. The ONA consists of 6 episodes who at the start circle around half an hour and later jump up to around and hour and 20 minutes or runtime. <br />
<br />
Story: As the name already suggests this ONA depicts the origin of Gundam that we know of, specifically the birth and background

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302603">
        of the first Gundam as well as the birth of iconic Gundam character Char Aznable. <br />
The story revolves around the siblings Casval and Artesia Rem Deikun, children of Zeon Zum Deikun who wants to make humans living in outer space colonies and who have been thus named Spacenoids independent from Earth. During a speech Zeon dies, presumably by poison. His children and his wife have to run from opposing parties are. Casval swears to take revenge on the ones who poisoned his father and made him, his sister and his mother suffer. <br />
The story is very dramatic and action-packed. Even if you are not accustomed to the Gundam series, such as myself, you will still appreciate the story and how well it is written. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: It&#039;s beautiful. That pretty much sums up the quality of this ONA. Not only does it include great camera movements but also outstanding and good CGI. (The CGI refers to the spaceships and vehicles). <br />
<br />
Sound:  Great compositions used in both the credits of each episode and in the battles. The music during the battles, especially the space battles makes your blood pump. All around great quality. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: The strongest point of this series, maybe added with the plot. There is no character who acts annoying, I can&#039;t and don&#039;t want to go into spoilers but the main characters and iconic Char Aznable show outstanding performances (as animated characters). Dialogues are not dry, each and every character is written perfectly. I can&#039;t praise it enough. <br />
<br />
Overall: Jup, we have a 9. Why not a 10? Because it&#039;s only a piece of the whole structure. As a whole the Gundam series and story surrounding it is indeed a masterpiece, and one of a size only very very few can match. This ONA in particular shows the power anime stories can have. This is what modern anime lacks in tons. I myself call such anime &#039;true anime&#039;. Those are anime that make you feel like you watch an ANIME and not yet another show this season. There are not a lot of true anime, or epic anime (epic as in the plot and the world is described as an epic or an epic world) and I hope we will receive such a time when epic anime and true anime appear again. Shows that make you feel the essense of anime and what makes anime stand out from the rest of fiction. Those who deny the impact Gundam had on the anime industry and Pop culture in general is ignorant, and wrong. Even as someone who hasn&#039;t seen a lot of Gundam and is just now slowly starting to go through the franchise it is a great experience. Great drama great characters, great action. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this ONA and I actually can&#039;t wait for the next Gundam that I will be watching some time in the future.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#039;s it for this review. I think I said everything that I wanted. Onto the review and even further beyond!

    I am not a Gundam fan. This is the first Gundam installment I have watched. I did at one point start the original 1979 series but dropped it after a few episodes. It was boring and childish. I chose instead to watch Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin because it looked more polished and intelligent, it seemed like a good starting point, and also because of the mostly rave reviews. I saw one review even mention Legend of the Galactic Heroes in comparison.<br />
<br />
So is Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin an excellent space epic, as I was somewhat lead to believe? Short answer, no. It does not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393830">
        achieve greatness as a whole. Sure, the art, animation and sound are all outstanding, and I did enjoy this 6 episode OVA for the most part. I was even considering scoring this a solid 8 (very good) at one point midway through. So why did I give it the respectable but maybe underwhelming score of 7? After all, the production value is among the very best in anime. <br />
<br />
Well, the problem lies in the most important parts of any anime. And that is the characters and the story. Plain and simple, the plot is just OK and the characters are lame, bordering on terrible with frequency. So why did I still score the character section a 6 and the show overall a 7? Don&#039;t story and characters outweigh graphics and sound? Well, yes, and Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin isn&#039;t completely lacking in these departments either. For all its mediocrity, it has an ace up its sleeve.<br />
<br />
For one reason or another, almost all the characters in this show are just plain bad. Between purple haired cry-babies, cone-head roid-ragers, and pigheaded adolescents, there is not much to like in the character department. So what is The Origin&#039;s trump card? Its the Red Comet of course, the character known as Char Aznable!<br />
<br />
Char is quite simply one of the best characters in any anime I have seen, and for that reason I have even added him to my coveted list of favorite characters. He is a shining red comet among a sea of buffoons. Sure, there are a few characters that are tolerable, such as Char&#039;s sister Sayla, but Char far outshines them all. I would go as far as saying Char Aznable is the reason you should watch this. His character carries the show, as he is the center of the most interesting story and drama.<br />
<br />
Take episode 5 for example. It is the weakest episode of this OVA. Expecting a glorious ascension to climax towards the end of the show, you get this snoozer of an episode. BUT LOOK! What is that!? That shining red light! It&#039;s Char!! *Loud cheering* Char again puts the show on his back and in a flash of brilliant vermilion he bursts into action as a god of war, reviving your interest in the show and boosting enjoyment levels to maximum. He puts his balls on the line in the critical moments and you love him for it.<br />
<br />
Now let me take a moment to applaud the voice actor of Char, Shuichi Ikeda. This guy is a big part of what makes Char so legendary. I now consider Ikeda-san to be amongst the very best voices in Anime, up there with the likes of 	Ryō Horikawa and Kei Tomiyama. Actually, I consider him to be my new favorite voice in anime. His voice and expression is that good, unique and outstanding.<br />
<br />
Ok, so Char has giant balls of steel, is a genius and a superior athlete. In addition, his voice actor delivers a legendary performance, being both unique and powerful. But we also love Char for his charisma. At times he seems cold and even malevolent. But it is never to an overwhelming or unreasonable point. One central aspect of his endearing charisma is his amusement and stoic joy in almost every situation he enters. He takes on his duties and chases his goals with steadfast commitment, but also enjoys the ride, never denying his own humanity. To put it simply, this is a character you can love, and there really aren&#039;t any others in the show.<br />
<br />
Now a word on the plot. The story is good enough and there are even some moments that can even be considered exhilarating, all involving our man Char. I would put the story and drama on the level of a FMA: Brotherhood. Good enough to keep you watching, but rarely outright exciting. The clear similarities to Star Wars and the not so subtle nods to 1930s Germany, among other things, are decent at best and uninspired trash at worst.<br />
<br />
On a somewhat random note, the character of Char is based on the famous WWI ace of aces, the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen. Char is even referred to as the ace of aces of Zeon. This is badass because who doesn&#039;t love the Bloody Baron? Well, Char does such a legend justice.<br />
<br />
Alright I&#039;m bored now so I&#039;m going to wrap it up.<br />
In summary, Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin is good enough to be worth your time if you enjoy science-fiction war stories or even if you just want to witness the legendary character of Char (if you haven&#039;t already from other Gundam material). The production value is outstanding, but the show as a whole is not. I came for epic science fiction and Char (I liked the aesthetics), and stayed for Char.<br />
As I stated at the beginning of this review, I am not a Gundam fan. This show did not change that.<br />
Rather than a show called &#039;Gundam&#039;, I would much prefer &#039;The Legend of the Red Comet&#039;.

    SS Review – Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin<br />
(Short and Sour)<br />
<br />
Before I start this review I would like to give my stance on Gundam, in other words where I am with the series and how familiar I am with it. I have next to no knowledge of this franchise…I have not watched anything Gundam related besides Gundam Build Fighters which I watched on a dare from a friend. But I don’t consider that to be anything really &quot;main series&quot; Gundam related seeing as it’s based solely on Gunpla which is model Gundams. With that knowledge I decided to watch this as it’s a prequel to the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307553">
        original series and it has more modern animation so it was easier to watch for me. (Nothing against old animation just some series don’t age very well and are harder to watch now than they used to be for me, Dragon Ball Z is a good example of this for me)<br />
<br />
The story is based mainly around two siblings; Casval Rem Deikun and Artesia Som Deikun, it centre’s around their youth mostly. It tells the story of their family, what happened to their family and what happens up to their late teens. I don’t want to talk too much about the story because I’ll be giving a lot of it away, there’s a war between two factions and Casval places himself in the centre of it while his sister tries to live a normal life. For the Gundam fans it talks about the rise of the Red Comet.<br />
<br />
There are other important characters but the OVA centres around the Daikun siblings mostly, towards the end (last 2-3 episodes) it show’s briefly what the main character of the original Gundam series is doing at the time. The Zabi family are a big focus of this OVA too. That’s all I have to say on the characters, I find personally the more you talk about the characters the more stuff you spoil. I like to be surprised on how the characters personalities play out.<br />
<br />
Art is great, it’s like a mix between old style animation and modern style CGI (the fight scenes anyway). OST is good as well.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this OVA and it was a good look into the Gundam series for me, I might watch the compilation films next as I couldn’t watch the whole series personally. Either way pretty good for a start on Gundam for me.<br />
<br />
7/10<br />

    Really shows the limitations of directly adapting a manga series, having all the best and worst moments thrown in together with no regard as to how it&#039;s going to play out in a new medium. Someday Japanese anime companies are going to realize that 100% faithfully adapting a comic into TV format doesn&#039;t actually always work, because one medium has sound and motion while the other has panel spacing and static imagery. Really, there were so many moments in these six Gundam: The Origin movies where they could have messed around with the pacing, or ignored the narration in favor of visual storytelling, or just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300669">
        done something creative with the fact that this is no longer a comic book.<br />
<br />
That aside, these movies are great because Gundam is great. As a prequel series (don&#039;t watch this unless you&#039;ve seen the original series, obviously), it does an amazing job of building up the stakes for a huge cast of characters on all sides of the war. Ramba Ral will become your favorite character in all of Universal Century, and seeing characters like Sayla and Amuro grow up in the face of growing conflict and war is a really interesting sight. The political machinations are incredible and the series hits hard at the military-industrial complex and rabid nationalism, among other real-life concepts that Gundam&#039;s always been a critic of.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, we do get to see the Colony Drop for the first time in Gundam history, that fateful colony drop to end all colony drops. It&#039;s... impactful. .....I&#039;ll leave.<br />
<br />
Char is ruthless, the Zabi family is the worst ever, and finally seeing the mobile suits fight for the first time is really awesome. If you like Gundam, you&#039;ll like this series a lot.

    [Edit] The only other Gundam that I gave the highest score was Iron-Blooded Orphans. Now I must give to Gundam: The Origin, too. As a Gundam fan, I watch everything Gundam-related, but few get the highest score. This is an outstanding OVA series, with an amazing story. I`ll tell you all about bellow, but I already warn you that you must be familiar with the Universal Century from Gundam, to get the full experience.<br />
<br />
Story: First, I must tell you that you need to know about the Universal Century (UC) storyline from the Gundamverse. If you are not familiar with the UC, you can still enjoy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300127">
        since this is basically the first part of the whole story (not by release, but chronologically). However, if you are familiar you will get the full experience, instead of just a basic enjoyment, you will remember who each character is and their role in the UC timeline, adding more depths to them. I think that only those who know the UC will agree with my highest score. Anyway, the story has an organic fell about it. Everything makes sense, it is well developed, perfect pacing, with a great balance between the political, the military, the action, and the characters stories. I fell that The Origin is everything that Gundam Unicorn tried to be, but couldn`t. I am extremely pleased that they decided to create this OVA series because the story is perfect in so many aspects that the only thing I can say is: watch, is just to damn good. But be warned, you will only fully enjoy if you know the UC of Gundam. Otherwise, it will feel has regular anime for you.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: Even better than Unicorn, in my opinion, in terms of art. And Unicorn is supposed to be the Gundam with the highest budget. My only complaint is that there is only one OST that I remember. Moreover, the mechas&#039; art is superb in The Origin.<br />
<br />
Character: Damn, they are all good. It is a surprise actually because all Gundam has at least one damn annoying character at some point. But hey, not here! All characters are great, or at least funny. After I saw The Origin I have a whole new appreciation for Char Aznable, the famous all-time antagonist of the Gundamverse. If you don`t know, Char is the reason all Gundam has a guy in a mask at some point. Char development is great. Actualy, it is so great that after this OVA series he became the most developed characters in the history of Gundam. The other characters like Dozle, Artesia and other secondary characters are all extremely well scripted. Thus, it is a surprise that no character felt out of place, or is compelled to make stupid choices.  They...are...all...good. I am just happy about this, you have no idea. So, don`t worry, you will not be disappointed here.<br />
<br />
Mechas: Not much variety here, you will mostly see Zakus. Nevertheless, the art for the mechas is OUTSTANDING. In The Origin, you will fell what made Gundam be known as Real Mecha Genre. The mechanical aspects are realistic, their movement is on point and it&#039;s like you can see how heavy they are. Amazing. If the mecha art of Gundam: The Origin became the standard for all Gundam, I would be a happy man.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is one of the best additions to the UC story I saw so far. The Origin makes Unicorn looks like a kid eating a bottle of glue in the corner of the class. Char became even more interesting after these OVA and everything is well scripted in this series. Don`t miss, just don`t miss it.

    The Universal Century Gundam timeline has always had an air of Game of Thrones in space (or more accurately the other way around, since Tomino was doing this decades before Martin). Nowhere is this more clearly felt than in Gundam: The Origin. By setting the bulk of the story in a time of relative peace, we see the political machinations, plotting, and betrayals come to the fore. It&#039;s riveting stuff, sprawling across an interplanetary stage. While Casval/Edouard/Char/Quattro (seriously, how many names does this guy have?) is the main focus, plenty of time is spent fleshing out many other familiar faces from the One Year War.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380967">
        It&#039;s nice to see some of the women finally have their time in the spotlight too, especially Sayla and Hamon, who were somewhat underserved by the original series and receive some memorable scenes here. And more Ramba Ral is always a good thing.<br />
<br />
The one thing that confused me a bit was the tone. The screenplay could easily be played deathly straight in classic Tomino fashion, but the character animation is strangely theatrical, with the Zabis chewing the scenery like pantomime villains. This is primarily the case in the first chapter, and is toned down in later chapters, which instead offload the humour to more minor characters to better effect. I get the impression that the director realised they&#039;d overdone it in that first chapter and quickly course-corrected.<br />
<br />
When war finally breaks out, it does so in epic fashion. Seeing a fleet battle where only one side has mobile suits makes it clear what a disruptive technology they are, and why ships keep to the rear in most subsequent engagements. These are some of the best large-scale battle scenes in anime, right up there with Yamato 2199/2202 and Legend of Galactic Heroes.<br />
<br />
Prequels can feel redundant sometimes, but The Origin never suffers from this problem. It&#039;s essential viewing for anyone with an interest in Gundam.
