<br />
Simply put, the story is like a very long version of a typical Violet Evergarden Episode, where this time Violet considers someone as her first real friend.<br />
<br />
Animation is like every KyoAni movie breath taking and in comparison to the TV-series, there is slightly no difference. As for the soundtrack, there is some old very recognized ones as well as some new tracks. Main and support characters are presented or mentioned, with also a lot of references from the TV-Series.<br />
<br />
Overall, very good story, animation and soundtracks. <br />
<br />

The Story/Synopsis,<br />

    Over the years of watching anime, none has touched me more deeply than Violet Evergarden TV series. For me, it was everything that a TV series could offer. Therefore, I was excited to hear that Violet Evergarden Gaiden will be coming to theaters in September. After I watched it on the release date in Tokyo, I can safely say that it is a masterpiece in every aspect.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is divided into two chapters. In the first chapter, Violet Evergarden goes to the private girls’ school and works as a private tutor for a girl named Isabella York. In the second chapter, the younger sister

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316920">
        of Isabella named Taylor Bartlett comes to CH Postal Company and starts working as an apprentice mail deliverer. These two chapters are masterfully intertwined into one coherent story. As you watch, you will laugh; you will cry; you will be moved beyond words could express. See it for yourself. It is as perfect as a story can be. <br />
<br />
Art: Violet Evergarden Gaiden is even better than the TV series in terms of quality and design. Whether it is an interior scene or an outdoor scene, the art design is impeccable. With vibrant colors and meticulously drawn scenery, every scene in the movie is breathtaking and a joy to watch. Simply put, KyoAni has delivered again. <br />
<br />
Sound: Violet Evergarden Gaiden’s sound design is some of the best I have ever experienced. It sets the mood perfectly and makes the scenes more beautiful and vibrant. Kudos to the sound director Youta Tsuruoka and the composer Evan Call. <br />
<br />
Character: Characters are well-developed and multifaceted. It is a masterful character design in every aspect. <br />
<br />
Overall Enjoyment: It is very enjoyable and has a lot of re-watch value. I would re-watch it multiple times when the Blu-ray is released. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, Violet Evergarden Gaiden is a masterpiece that is built upon a solid foundation. It complements the TV series and offers a fantastic experience. It is one of the best, if not the best anime movies I have ever watched.   <br />

    Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou serves as another episode of Violet Evergarden but longer than usual. <br />
<br />
What&#039;s unique about this movie in which stands out more than any other normal Violet Evergarden episodes are : <br />
<br />
- It has slight Yuri tease. <br />
- Violet doesn&#039;t really have much role in this movie. Instead, the movie feels more focused towards the two sisters. Amy Bartlett and Taylor Bartlett ( slightly contravening the rule of slice of life but I wasn&#039;t bothered by it ).<br />
<br />
This movie is like a dream come true for me. I used to think that if Violet Evergarden had Yuri. At

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325965">
        least a little. Would it make the anime overall better? This is my answer. Yes. Yes, indeed. <br />
<br />
Other than the Yuri teases that made me scream and go all fanboy over it. The movie uses the same soundtracks from Violet Evergarden ( except the ED ) and the quality is pretty much the same. <br />
<br />
I cried my balls out when I was watching this movie. My eyes went red. My body was shaking. I tried to control myself but I couldn&#039;t. I&#039;d say that this movie&#039;s sadness scale is comparable to the normal anime episode where Violet skipped on the pond or the famous episode 10 that everybody cries over. <br />
<br />
I had an amazing time watching this movie. It feels nice to be back and I&#039;m also incredibly glad that I had the privilege to watch this early. Y&#039;all peeps who haven&#039;t watched this yet. Don&#039;t be fooled by the movie&#039;s rating. It was botted. The movie was actually OK HAND.

--The review contains spoilers--<br />
<br />
<br />
A young girl struggling in school, soon to be sent to marry an unknown man, suffering physically, mentally from a starkly different past - memories that seem otherworldly considering where she is now. Her existence is defined by her name, but there were days where it was defined by her &#039;sister&#039;. This is the life of Isabella York, Violet&#039;s next client.<br />
<br />
This movie is not a direct sequel to the main series and is different from the other movie to be released in April 2020. <br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou is a movie which adapts Chapter 2 of the Violet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328036">
        Evergarden Gaiden novel. For those who didn&#039;t know, Chapter 1 of the Gaiden has already been adapted in the main series (Episode 5: the letter exchange between the prince/princess). <br />
<br />
As for when this is set in the main series&#039; timeline, it is definitely after Chapter 4 (Leon, the astronomer) and Chapter 10 (Lux) but before Chapters 11-13 (flying letters and train hijack) from the novel. So essentially between 10 and 11. Therefore in the anime series it would be between Episodes 6 and 13.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The movie has a similar format to Violet Evergarden&#039;s adventures throughout the main series, except that it&#039;s much longer.<br />
<br />
Since there is still no synopsis included in the main page, I will give a short one here. The movie is essentially divided into 2 parts:<br />
<br />
Violet has been called to a special school for girls to spend 3 months with the daughter of a major noble family. The girl she has to take care of, Isabella York, is struggling to adapt into her school environment and its demands, as the movie hints her past.The second part focuses on Isabella&#039;s sister and her experience working for CH Postal Company. The 2 parts are obviously related, but I won&#039;t go beyond this.<br />
<br />
Most of the focus is on Isabella and her sister, rather than Violet. It seems this movie was not made to entirely focus on Violet&#039;s development. She is already presented as an experienced AutoMemories doll, so the focus is more on the clients. I suppose this is better since some viewers complained about the lack of character development of the clients in the main series.<br />
<br />
Its main message is one that is mentioned frequently in Violet Evergarden: &quot;Letters can connect people&quot;. Another example of the recurring themes of relationships between people and how letters can facilitate/enhance them. <br />
<br />
This time the adventure is about the relationship between siblings and their unique circumstances, the rekindling of a lost connection and the barriers against them. It seems there is a strong sense of separation between the siblings (physically) compared to other episodes, which emphasised the hopelessness of the siblings in being able to reunite. Violet&#039;s role was quite different in this movie - she seemed more open in putting herself in the clients&#039; shoes, and helping out Isabella&#039;s sister work in CH postal mirrored scenes of herself being cared by Hodgins, showing a new side of her mature character.<br />
<br />
The story as a whole is structured well with flashbacks for viewers to understand Isabella&#039;s past. The two parts are incorporated well enough so they don&#039;t feel too detached from each other. <br />
<br />
The main flaw in the story is the chain of events that link Isabella to the York family. It is rather sudden and feels like it comes out of nowhere. This is indifferent from the novel and although without this detail the story would not exist, there may have been better alternatives for the reasoning. <br />
<br />
In addition, I also had mixed emotions about the time gap between the 2 parts: 3 years. I understood the purpose of it, however it does extend the main plot&#039;s timeline a lot, which may affect the development of CH postal workers but more importantly Gilbert. In other words, this may be another obstacle to overcome for KyoAni if they attempt to explain Gilbert&#039;s whereabouts or absence from the main plot. But this is just speculation - more like me hoping Gilbert gets more screentime :( <br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
The relationship between Isabella and Violet is the best feature of the movie in terms of character development. Violet&#039;s understanding of a client&#039;s past was at its best out of most of her experiences. Her growth from the initial stages of the main series has been immense. What looked like a typical client-doll relationship eventually led to something more than friendship. Events in their past, although different, forged a strong connection between them. The changes were clear - lessons were easier (or more bearable), communication became more relaxed and most importantly Isabella was able to open up to Violet about her past. Overall, their bond is unique and it is one that has not been explored in other episodes. Indeed, some scenes were more intimate than usual, which is unexpected considering the usual protective and reserved nature from Violet towards her clients. Yet more evidence of her growing emotional intelligence, you love to see it.<br />
 <br />
And let’s not forget Isabella’s sister - simply adorable. KyoAni really impressed with their attempt to give more of a story for Isabella&#039;s sister, which was one of the major flaws of the original novel chapter. Her importance was balanced perfectly with her older sister, and the ending was a perfect finale.<br />
<br />
One other positive was the appearance of Benedict Blue - a well known postman at CH postal - and his direct involvement in the second part of the movie. Not only was it enjoyable to see one of the original company workers from the novel, this movie could also be a sign that there is potential for Benedict and Cattleya to get the screen time they deserve in future works.<br />
<br />
Some areas could have been developed more: Isabella&#039;s thoughts on the purpose of the school - essentially preparing young girls for arranged marriages - may have been interesting. Her suffering from her past was overpowering almost everything else. Indeed, Isabella&#039;s relationship with her sister is memorable, but other aspects of her character seemed to be ignored, which was slightly disappointing. Assigning one event which defines his/her life can make a character boring sometimes, if you get what I mean.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I enjoyed Luculia&#039;s appearance in the movie!<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
Amazing visuals as usual, the highlight was the dancing scenes between Violet and Isabella. Landscapes were excellent. At this point you start to wonder if anything&#039;s not going to be bright and pretty in Violet Evergarden. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
Most of the songs are the same as the main series bar the ED. The music during the dance was the highlight. Voice acting was great from everyone.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8<br />
Another tearjerker for VE fans, but maybe not the cup of tea for those disappointed by the main series.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
Great as a side story and a nice addition to the Violet Evergarden works as a whole. Some minor disappointments but KyoAni did their best with the content they had from Chapter 2 of the Gaiden novel, as well as recovering from the tragic event that happened before the movie&#039;s release in Japan.<br />
<br />
I look forward for the new movie in April.<br />

    &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot; is a show that I love since the first time I have seen it. Is creative, is smart, is Sutil, it knows how to make a good drama, the animation is just beautiful. One of my favorite anime (and animation titles in general) of all time, has a 10/10 from me...<br />
<br />
The fun part is that I didn&#039;t see the movie even knowing it was the sequel of one of my favorite animation titles, mostly because of the fact that I thought it was completely unnecessary...<br />
<br />
The show ended really strong. Violet has learned humanity, finally getting over his military life and living like a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336166">
        person who helps others to express emotions...<br />
<br />
I watch the movie when they put it on Netflix, I was fairly excited, I ended and...<br />
<br />
Yeah, it was bad and disappointing.<br />
<br />
Plot:<br />
First of all, the movie as a whole is just a long episode...<br />
<br />
you could really just slip them in two and put them in the original show. The first problem is that because of the fact that it is just a long episode, it feels amazingly slow for moments, with minutes just with the characters being still and taking something that doesn&#039;t have to do with the plot or with his development.<br />
<br />
It is also pretty overdramatic since the main reason why the conflict is happening is pretty non-sensical...<br />
<br />
So, a poor girl with his poor little sister resulted to be the lost daughter of some rich dude and now that dude wants to take care of his daughter?<br />
<br />
Why the girl trusted in a random dude that told her that she is someone special out of nowhere? is she gonna accept that fact so easily? she is gonna gave up her sister to some random strangers?. It simply doesn&#039;t make sense, the overall set-up of the drama is the result of a retarded decision of the main character.<br />
<br />
The drama feels forced because of the fact that it isn&#039;t constructed out of something human or realistic like in the original show, it is made out of some exaggerated concept, in a really convenient way, I really didn&#039;t cry with the original show, but the drama felt natural. Another thing that I didn&#039;t like is the obvious Yuri fan service in all the first half, like, it was so annoying seen Violet having sexual and romantic tension with Violet and the entire scenes that are just there for making the fans go nuts (the dance when they sleep together)<br />
<br />
The moral of the history is nice, but it feels like a recycle of the moral of one of the episodes of the show. When the second half started i was wondering how it was going to be, because of the fact that almost every conflict was resolved already and the moral was already there.<br />
<br />
My fears came true, in the second half nothing happens, I know this time we center in the little sister and it was foreshadowed since the first scene of the movie, but again, it feels it was something from last minute and, like two different movies. We never really explore the character of the little sister, her only personality is being cute, the other characters are just here. It is just a fluffy filler. In the last 15 minutes finally, something happens<br />
<br />
The little girl wants to contact her sister and, the set-up for that feels cartoony, the resolution was rushed and it fails to leave an emotional impact for the fact that we don&#039;t know this character, most of the movie was just watching them going to school, working in a quirky job, talking about funny things. Like a generic high school anime but with the fact that it isn&#039;t high school.<br />
<br />
Disordered, unfocused and with an awful plantation.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
I mean, they are just dolls (i know, bad joke)...<br />
<br />
The movie expects that you are already familiar with the old cast, so they became just passive spectators of what is happening.<br />
<br />
The only exception to that is the blond mailman, that was in the original show but it didn&#039;t have too much attention, but even then, his character is just the sarcastic voice and it is limited to be a plot device (you know, he is the inspiration to the little girl to be a mailman herself).<br />
<br />
The new cast doesn&#039;t have a personality or even an archetype, they are lank-papers. the thing that is just here for being sad and cute. 2 hours and I don&#039;t know anything about the little girl, or the rich girl, or anyone. Violet is also another plot device here as well, she just makes the plot goes forward and is treated as a kind of god by the new characters, destroying everything that the new show was trying to build.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
To be fair with the movie, the animation is gorgeous. Everything is amazingly detailed, the cinematics and special effects are great, the movement is fluid in an extreme way, everything is clean, everything.  is huge. the art direction is impressive, the art style is also impressive. Is basically a piece of art<br />
<br />
However, I have problems with the scenario. This is supposed to be the early 1910s or something and sometimes looks like the 50s and others like the 70s, then like 30s and then it looks like it is from the 18th century. It is really inconsistent with his scenario.<br />
<br />
Music:<br />
<br />
I liked the song form the end credits...<br />
<br />
The voice acting is great, the music is the same from the show but again, the music from the show is awesome and it fits with the whole atmosphere.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have any problems here.<br />
<br />
Overall, is a bad movie, the plot is a mess, this basically doesn&#039;t have characters, it has dolls with no exploration, the main conflict is ridiculous and the resolution was anti-climatic.<br />
<br />
I guess if you are a fan of the original show you would like it but... I&#039;m a fan of the original show and I found it boring.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    this is not the best story I have ever seen from the story of &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot;<br />
but there are some things that I like about this movie. I will not give spoilers.<br />
<br />
First, of course, the music and graphics that I should say are &quot;perfect&quot;.<br />
secondly, I like the role of &quot;benedict&quot; here is quite important and the story feels more balanced, not only women who play a lot. I have complained about the story of violet evergarden before, because male characters don&#039;t get enough roles. honestly i am very happy to see this.<br />
Third, in this movie, Kyoani managed to create a good story line. opens well, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review329767">
        closes well, without leaving many questions after watching.<br />
<br />
I can not give a perfect point for this movie, because the story presented is no better than story of Violet evergarden TV Series which is very climax. But for side story (this movie is a side story of violet evergarden sequel), I love it. don&#039;t be pessimistic because this is only a side story, this movie is highly recommended to watch. I hope KyoAni will not be bored to present this beautiful work.<br />
I will always be enthusiastic waiting for the next story from Violet chan.

    Violet Evergarden Gaiden is a side story to the main series and this is another tale of Violet&#039;s journey during her time as an Auto Memory Doll. Overall this 90-minute movie is a pleasant watch that goes along well with the spirit of the series - telling touching stories about human bonds and emotions, how they are expressed and how it empowers one to change for the better.<br />
<br />
This review contains spoiler.<br />
<br />
There are two main arcs in this movie. During the first half, Violet travels to a private school and becomes a tutor for Isabelle York, who comes from a prestigious royal family. In that period

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322076">
        of 3 months, a friendship is born between Violet and Isabelle as they spend time with each other. Isabelle tells Violet about her past during the war, and how she took in a young, orphaned girl by the name of Taylor as her adoptive sister. She recounts the happiness she shared with Taylor, before unfortunate circumstances resulted in the separation of the two. After the end of Violet&#039;s contract, Isabelle requests Violet to write a letter to Taylor, and then the second arc of the story commences. Taylor, who is now a grown child, finds her way to CH Postal Service years later after having received Isabelle&#039;s letter, hoping that she can becomes a mail deliverer in order to &#039;bring happiness to people&#039;, and of course, being able to deliver one personally to her dear big sister one day.<br />
<br />
The story structure is simple and effective. We get to see both characters and their stories of separation and reunite, each told separately. But the pacing is a bit too quick during the first arc. Most of the movie time is spent on telling the story of Isabelle and Taylor, so the development between Violet and Isabelle during their time together felt rushed and it left a bit of unsatisfaction. Fortunately, there&#039;s a dance scene that compensates for it (I&#039;ll talk about it later) and Isabelle and Taylor&#039;s stories are solidly built. Their relationship is strong and it was told thoroughly and thoughtfully. It&#039;s a nice portrayal of human bond, and the tone of the story is lighter comparing to the other heavier and more emotional stories during Violet&#039;s journeys. Their ending is quite poignant; bittersweet, but hopeful which will surely leave a smile to your face.<br />
<br />
Characters are perhaps the most important aspect of this series, and while this one is on par with the baseline quality of the series. I personally felt a bit mixed. The main reason is that I love to see more of Violet&#039;s growth, and it was a very reasonable expectation because this is a 90-minute movie. But, like I said above, there wasn&#039;t much screentime for Violet in this movie because of the rushed pacing during the first arc. Most of what you want to see from Violet happens here during her cultivating friendship with Isabelle. But because of the pacing problem, the time it took for them to become closer, enough to tell each other about their past is like a quick breeze, considering Isabelle is portrayed as cold and unfriendly towards Violet initially, it felt a bit unnatural, at least to me. Their relationship aside, there are still moments which you&#039;ll see Violet&#039;s physical and emotion display as a result of growth from her previous journeys, and it is a nice thing to see. As for Isabelle, her present day portrayal is somewhat affected as well, but her past was told well and it correlated with the state that she&#039;s in now, so her character is decent overall. And as for Taylor, well, she is still a child, so what you see from her is what you get, not much to say here. <br />
<br />
Art and animation is spot on as always. It is just what you expected to see if you are familiar with the series: vivid, beautiful, charming, almost like a fantasy land. One of my favorite scenes is Violet and Isabelle dancing together in the ballroom. It was just amazingly animated. I can&#039;t help but fawned all over Violet&#039;s beauty and gracefulness.<br />
The tracks are good. They reuse most of the tracks from the previous series, but there&#039;s an improvement in when they use them and when not to, using only the scene&#039;s atmosphere, which is a good plus.<br />
<br />
Despite some problems with the pacing which affects character developement, this is still a solid movie. As a fan of the series, watching it is such a nice experience and it always leaves a delightful aftertaste. <br />

    Minor spoilers to the film and SAO within the review<br />
NOTE: I have not read the light novels of the film or the TV show and this is entirely based on what the anime has to offer.<br />
<br />
When I had first watched Violet Evergarden, the series had left a hole in my heart for being a sad, happy, and vibrant story of Violet’s trouble adjusting to the post-war era, becoming an ‘Auto Memory Doll’ to understand what her Major meant when he said: “I love you”. The side story: ‘Eternity and the Auto Memories Doll’ follows that journey, of Violet’s growth in the series, but what I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323680">
        believe is not canon to the actual story. And is a decent spin-off of the plot of Violet Evergarden.<br />
<br />
Plot 5/10<br />
Violet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memories Doll, follows the story of a Noble family member named ‘Isabella York’ who is tired of living her life in this ‘prison’ of a boarding school until she meets Violet, who changes her life entirely. This section of the movie was in my opinion, the best part of the 90-minute film, but it had its issues. The main issue of this part is the pacing, it seems that the entire section of Isabell’s character growth was skimmed over with what felt to be not even 20 minutes, of course, I didn’t time it, but it felt really short and underwhelming. When heading into this film I expected this movie to be revolving around the character growth of Isabella and Violet within the boarding school. This was not the case. In the 20-45 or so minutes of screen-time that this section of the film gets, there seem to be many details skimmed over that might have been deemed unnecessary to the plot. This seems to be a mistake as the character development felt rushed and lack-lustre. <br />
<br />
After the first part of the movie, the movie introduces us to another main character, Taylor. I can’t go into very much detail about her but she has close ties to Isabell, but they have split apart due to reasons. Taylor takes over the second part of the film as she tries to find Isabella again with the help of Violet Evergarden and Benedict. At this point in time in the film, I feel that the story took somewhat of a 180 with the story, performing a time-skip and having some sort of a ‘second-arc’ of the film. This kind of felt like the first season of SAO when the characters leave Aincrad Kirito still has to save Asuna who was transferred to another VRMMO game. It was unnecessary and made the arc that was prior seemed skimmed over and unfleshed. <br />
<br />
Sound 8.5/10<br />
The OST of the film was mostly re-used from the TV show and doesn’t need to be explained thoroughly. If you’ve watched Violet Evergarden, you will know how good the OST is for the show and this is no different, it still somewhat adds a ‘magic’ feeling to the scene of the movie, but points can be taken off because of the pacing that ruined the character development.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
Kyoto Animation has done it again with their vibrant, unique art styles that they perform to their works that create a realistic feeling. CG in the film is there and noticeable, but there seemed to be only 1 or 2 scenes that did use CG, they may have been more than just those but they were unnoticeable as they blended so well with the background art style.<br />
<br />
Character 5/10<br />
Due to the pacing problem with the plot, certain aspects of the movie were skimmed over, creating a feeling of unsatisfaction as the characters didn’t have any meaning placed behind them and the 180 of the story didn’t help either diluting the character growth, making it a stagnant mess with the three or four main characters. With the first half of the film being about Isabell and the second about Taylor, it just didn’t feel that there was enough attention with each of them and that focusing on one or the other would have produced a greater piece of work, by fixing the big pacing issue that plagued the entire film.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5.5/10<br />
Hopping into the film, the first part had really entertained me with the bond between Violet and Isabell, but the switch of stories and main characters diluted the entire film and kind of ruined the experience by the feeling that is was just 2 stories that barely correlated together, being stretched and sewn together to create this 90-minute film.<br />
<br />
Overall/Conclusion 6.5/10<br />
Violet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memories Doll seemed to have sewn two stretched episodes of the show and create a decent but lacklustre movie that had issues with the pacing, character growth and the overall 180 of the story of the movie at the halfway mark, making the overall rating of the film a 6-7/10.<br />

    I have generally been a fan of this series, which is both beautifully written and beautifully animated. So this review pertains only to this specific movie and not to the series overall. I still love Violet Evergarden, even through its most sentimental moments. <br />
<br />
What I&#039;m going to write here concerns the ENDING of Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou. So please DO NOT read on, unless you have watched it first! <br />
<br />
[[[SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT DANGER DANGER]]]<br />
<br />
Alright, so what is the deal with this ending? It honestly makes me want to write a bunch of angry letters to the studio, the directors and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334086">
        writers and everyone who had a say in this. What the bloody hell is the point of withholding the emotional payoff that the movie has been building up to for 90 minutes? I simply do not understand this kind of writing. I don&#039;t understand this kind of storytelling. Who on Earth is satisfied with the way this concluded? Taylor hiding in the goddamn bushes while her letter to her long lost sister is delivered and read? And they cry, separately - one not knowing the other is watching!!! What kind of emotional payoff are we supposed to gain from this display of pointless and bizarre voyeurism? In what WORLD would Taylor NOT run to her sister upon seeing how she reacts to her letter? <br />
<br />
No, this is bullshit. I had honestly enjoyed the movie up until this point (except maybe for the silly boots Benedict Blue is wearing and which the animators seem to love showing off). It&#039;s truly beautifully designed and animated. But this is sadly one of those cases where the ending ruins the entire thing for me. I was literally yelling at the screen when it became clear that Taylor and Isabella weren&#039;t going to meet again, even though they were just a few feet apart. To hell with this crap! <br />

Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou gets 4 stars for the art alone. If story didn&#039;t matter it would get 10. But it does and this one is just incredibly unfulfilling! <br />

    So here&#039;s my spoiler-Free Review:<br />
<br />
I had always been a fan of Violet Evergarden. And when I saw that you&#039;d be able to watch it on Netflix, I was already ready to give it a 10, even though I haven&#039;t even seen it yet.<br />
<br />
Visuals: as expected, It was a beauty! Just beautiful. Every frame is just mind-blowing. The cinematography, the animation, the art style... Heck, my sister even got annoyed about how I couldn&#039;t stop talking about how beautiful this movie looks while we were watching.<br />
<br />
The Story: Well, It might have been  already obvious what the story was gonna be about. But the way it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334082">
        was told, the dialogue, the pacing was done so well. <br />
<br />
Characters: Soo character development... That I didn&#039;t much expect. They feel alive, each had their own personality and their dialogue is like I previously mentioned very well written.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d give this a score of 11/10! Really really glad I got to watch this one. Prepare tissues, Lots of them. Easily became one of my favorites. Totally a must-watch.<br />
<br />

    I love this movie. Watching it on theaters was such a beautiful experience. I didn&#039;t regret it at all.<br />
<br />
Story: At first I kinda worried, in the first half of the movie is kinda flat for me and too long. Also yuri vibe is really dominant, but I still love the relationship between Amy and Violet.<br />
And then the second half of the movie where it gets interesting. Start with a time skip, and the story focused on Taylor. The time skip kinda shook me and from that I know this will be really really emotional movie. Taylor make this movie more lively with her motivation to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328040">
        be a postman and the relationship between her and Benedict. I am glad that Benedict get a screen time, he is become my favorite character because of this movie it all because of his attitude towards Taylor, and the moments he search the address, also the way she gives Taylor message to Amy. I believe this movie won&#039;t be that emotional if Violet that gives Taylor messages to Amy.<br />
<br />
Art: Well because it is a movie by KyoAni, the quality must be very high. The transition was good, the scenery really beautiful. The coloring was good<br />
<br />
Sound: The first half of the movie was a bit silent, not so much OST played. The second half of the movie more lively wth some OST from the Violet Evergarden series.<br />
<br />
Character: Violet is already become a good &quot;Doll&quot; with her formal attitude as always. Amy as a character develop well with Violet in the first half of the movie. Taylor is such a lively character, her motivation to be a postman is really touching that also affect Benedict as a character.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I really enjoy this movie, maybe it is because I watched it on theaters. Such a memorable moment to watch an emotional and well made animation movie in theaters.<br />
<br />
Overall: This is such a good movie. If it goes to your theaters, give it a go. Just enjoy every bit second of it and you will get the feels.<br />

    Literally one of the most beautiful anime movie ever made. (Probably the most beautiful so far.)<br />
<br />
-Emotional as always<br />
-Little funnier than before<br />
-Beautiful more than ever<br />
<br />
Choice and setting of the backgrounds were so good and beautiful that I don&#039;t have words to describe.<br />
<br />
People: Most beautiful shots can only be taken from Kimi no na wa.<br />
Me: That means you haven&#039;t saw my typist yet.<br />
<br />
Even the nobodies (especially the girls from school) were so beautifully designed--<br />
Man what can I say.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
---------------Spoilers coming---------------<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Unlike the masterpiece &quot;Michishirube&quot;, the ending wasn&#039;t special enough.<br />
<br />
Osts made the movie more emotional just like before but, the best scene of the movie was made by the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340891">
        ost since when Benedict had a conversation with Isabella till he got back to his new motor bike.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Taylor was just a little bit cute but worthy to be called a great kid because of her humor and strong sense of thinking.<br />
<br />
Isabella was great and beautiful and Violet looked beautiful more than ever because of her white dancing dress. (Her beauty consumed me and forced me to think that she is the most beautiful girl ever.)<br />
<br />
Story of the new characters was good but I loved Benedict the most. He wasn&#039;t in my favorites before. He developed like Eiffel Tower. (Now he reminds me of &quot;Martin&quot; from &quot;Monster&quot;. I guess it&#039;s because they both learned something from the jobs they were sick of. The coincidence is that their jobs were related to females.)<br />
<br />
It always feels very good to see Lucullia. Even though days of Violet and Isabella were unique, I still love Lucullia more because she was one of the person to accept and help Violet when she was in the hardest times of her life. Lucullia is always kind as she always was.<br />
<br />
And uncle white beard (I call him &quot;Uncle Iroh of Violet Evergarden&quot;) who always use to tell about the love that binds us. Sadly he is retired now from the delivery job. I wish he stayed.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Movie as an overall would have been a masterpiece (like the original series) if and only if they hadn&#039;t included unnecessary fanservice of my precious Violet.<br />
<br />
9/10

    ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン 外伝 -永遠と自動手記人形-  A wonderful feature-length episode that enchantingly follows in the footsteps of world-famous literature. A superb standalone episode that both visually and narratively engages the viewer with logically and believably developing characters in beautiful and breathtaking art and animation.<br />
<br />
Story: On the trail of outstanding novels and merges them into a new touching story (9/10)<br />
It may not be the first that comes to mind, but here the basic idea of the well-known fairy tale &quot;Aschenbuttel&quot; (aka Cinderella) has been adapted very beautiful and credibly. In contrast to the Brothers Grimm&#039;s collection of fairy tales, the protagonist here is called &quot;Amy&quot;, but the inspiration

          <span style="display: none;" id="review370959">
        from the story of Charles Perrault&#039;s &quot;Cendrillon ou la Petite Pantoufle de verre&quot; is still recognisable. The second world famous novel to be discovered here was written by Charles Dickens and is entitled &quot;The Parish Boy&#039;s Progress&quot; (aka Oliver Twist). Taylor is the little orphan girl who experiences warmth and security for the first time and is also given a chance. I really enjoyed how the two classic novels were woven together in a beautiful and heartfelt story. The pace of the narrative is good and the characters very believable for an earlier epoch.<br />
<br />
Characters: admirable in expressing dynamic and credible emotions (10/10)<br />
The cast, familiar from the TV series, has been enriched by two new protagonists. The feature film length allows for a very profound character portrayal, which was well realised.<br />
York, Isabella (alias Bartlett, Amy):<br />
She is the heiress of the prestigious York family, but as an illegitimate daughter she has grown up in very poor and hard circumstances. Amy is an attractive young woman with long burgundy hair and usually wears glasses. Her education at an elite girls&#039; academy to become a lady of high society has so far been less than successful due to her previously disadvantaged background. To remedy this situation, Violet is hired as a private tutor, and in order not to jeopardise the young aristocrat, Violet poses as her maid. As in the classic original, Amy lacks something to be accepted in high society. Cinderella needed clothes, in Amy&#039;s case it is the lack of etiquette. This fact and the insecurity that comes with it, make her appearance seem brusque and dismissive at first. However, her personality changes in the course of the film. The portrayal of this change and the human bonds, the emotions of the characters, their thoughts and feelings is what makes this story so worth watching. The focus is not on a complex story or unforeseen plot twists, but rather on concentrating on understandable and tangible emotions without falling into kitsch.<br />
(Trivia: Connection with the 5th episode of the TV series. Violet received the request from the Drossel family on the recommendation of Alberta. Alberta is the maid of Princess Charlotte (Kingdom of Drossel) who, with Violet&#039;s help, has send love letters to Prince Damian (Kingdom of Flügel).<br />
Bartlett, Taylor:<br />
Taylor is a young girl with medium-length orange-red hair tied in two braids with red ribbons. She is a bright and energetic girl with large, kind, sparkling brown eyes and a few freckles. Her character portrayal reminds me a lot of the novel Oliver Twist. An orphan wrapped in a blanket, huddled by the side of the road, trying to warm up. The way Taylor took Amy&#039;s hand was touching and Amy decided to make this foundling her sister and call her Taylor. Life was not easy, they rarely had enough to eat and lived in a one-room hut, but Taylor found human warmth and security.<br />
Violet, Evergarden:<br />
Violet is a very beautiful, attractive young woman with light blue eyes, waist-length golden hair, a fair complexion and a slender, feminine appearance. During the war, Violet lost her arms and was given manoeuvrable prosthetic arms made of adamant silver.<br />
Violet&#039;s personality has changed a lot over the course of the TV series and this episode shows the result of that change in a very beautiful way. There is no sign in this episode of the former orphan who grew up as a child soldier in the army, was abused as a tool of war and whose behaviour therefore often seemed eccentric and tactless because she did not understand the feelings of other people, as well as emotions in general. By working as an Auto Memories Doll and meeting very different clients, she gained access to and understanding of the world of emotions and, through writing many letters, realised the deep significance of feelings in life and how precious and valuable each individual life is. Against this background, she approaches Amy (Isabella) with Violet&#039;s typical respectful, caring and gentle old-fashioned manner, which makes her appear more like a knight than a maid to all the other students.<br />
The development of Violet is an important reason to point out that it is better to watch this episode after the first season!<br />
Benedict, Blue:<br />
Benedict had a little less screen time in the TV series, which doesn&#039;t do him justice considering the light novel. I&#039;m glad he gets a little more attention in this episode. He is a slender, handsome young man with bright sky-blue eyes, sandy-blonde hair and fair skin. Visually, one could mistake him and Violet for siblings, but in terms of clothing and manners, that thought turns out to be a mistake. Benedict dresses rather flamboyantly, usually with a loose shirt and braces, military green tight leather trousers and black high-heeled boots laced tightly from the knee down, and as a supplement to motorcycling he also wears a pair of black fingertipless gloves. <br />
He comes across as somewhat stubborn and quick-tempered. As he also tends to confront people directly with his thoughts without formulating them well beforehand, they can be hurtful or just seem a bit too direct. Nevertheless, at the bottom of his heart he is kind and gentle, considerate of those he cares about, and sometimes even chivalrous. These somewhat hidden qualities are wonderfully portrayed through his behaviour towards Taylor.<br />
<br />
Visuals: Very high production standards, a pleasure for the eyes (9.5/10)<br />
The art Kyoto Animation has created with this film impresses with a very beautiful colour palette that is not only extensive but also perfectly coordinated. The landscapes, the buildings as well as their furnishings and the people who play in them appear as one, despite the 2D and 3D techniques. Well, I&#039;m not known for CG being my cup of tea. But in Violet Evergarden, it&#039;s very nice to see that CG-given details can also be rendered with drawn elements as a cohesive whole. Moreover, the play of light and shadow is well complemented.<br />
The animation is in no way inferior to the art, the dynamic movements of the characters appear natural and fluid. The animation also impressively portrays the emotional world of the characters with good facial expressions and plausible gestures, thereby creating an overall coherent atmosphere with convincing characters in an artistically impressive setting. In my opinion, the production more than lives up to the very high expectations.<br />
<br />
Sounds: Very nice music arrangements, great VA (8/10) <br />
As in the series, the background music was composed by Evan Call. The music is both beautiful and fitting. Violet&#039;s train ride at the beginning is a good example. It is basically a simple scenario, but the viewer has to go through several time jumps and change of location within less than two minutes from the boat trip to Violet&#039;s arrival at the station. But if one listen carefully, the jumps are easily understood by the music. At the beginning there is a boat trip without music and only when the town comes into view does a familiar melody from the series set in and connects Violet with the child who arrives on the ship. The melody remains until Violet arrives at her destination. This connection, will explain itself until the end of the episode. The music reflects both the emotions of the characters and the meaning of the scene, thus preparing the viewer for the further action. This connection between music, character and the scenario is confirmed again immediately afterwards. The film jumps back to Violet&#039;s train ride to her destination, it&#039;s daytime and the music is different. Beautiful landscape, beautiful music with a chorus and yet a little melancholic touch showing that Violet is travelling into the unknown. Very nicely realised scene change and the continued music creates a connection between Violet and the next protagonist. <br />
Incidentally, the scene in which Violet sits in the dark train compartment in front of the brightly lit window has a counterpart in the famous anime &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Although the emotional message from Kusanagi Motoko, who looks outside from her darkened apartment through the brightly lit window, is much stronger, the basic mood fits here as well. The BGM is great and underscores the plot and the characters&#039; emotions through the soulful orchestral soundtrack, which knows how to enhance both the hilarity as well as heartbreaking drama, and accompanies the anime&#039;s scenarios beautifully at all times.<br />
The ED is called &quot;Amy&quot; and is sung by Chihara, Minori. A very beautiful and intricately arranged orchestral melody that highlights the piano in a very soulful way.<br />
The dialogue direction is excellent, the conversations are coherent and plausible for an earlier era, as well as the distinguished way of speaking that belongs to that time. For the dubbing voices, this time I would like to mention the work of Yūki, Aoi. She did the voice of Taylor Bartlett. In her excellent performance, both the young girl&#039;s cheerful temperament and insecurity were portrayed very well. Endou, Aya as the voice of Cattleya Baudelaire is very feminine, tender and also has the aura of an experienced woman with a lot of temperament and a slightly lascivious note in the tempre. The great performance of Endou-san, I already noticed very positively in the TV series. I would also like to mention Uchiyama, Kouki as the voice of Benedict Blue, because his performance is also very successful. Uchiyama-san basically has a very pleasant baritone vocal range, but skillfully speaks a little rougher. I like the presentation and it goes well with the character.<br />
The sound effects are stunning, which is noticeable right at the beginning with the screaming of the seagulls, the crashing of the waves and the sounds of the ship. Everything is appropriate, not too much and not too little and at the right time. But what pleases me most is that they maintain their standards in every respect until the end.<br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden and the Bond of Friendship is technically and narratively a spectacular work with a clear, but emotionally sensitive message about the meaning of gentle words and the sheer power of human emotions. The natural but logical development of the characters, as well as the visual and acoustic aspects, combine to create a work that captivates the viewer. Kyoto Animation realised every scene with great care and attention to detail. The talent to convey to the viewer what the characters feel has been masterfully implemented to create an anime, emotionally moving, as very few studios can. <br />
<br />
In memory of everyone at Kyoto Animation<br />
Thank you so much for this beautiful and touching anime

    This movie is a &quot;spinoff&quot; story of the Violet Evergarden TV series. I use quotations because I think the story in the movie is the TV show at its best: when Violet is the still an essential character that makes the story possible but not the central character to that story. So, if you wanted the show to focus on Violet more consistently ... maybe the movie will frustrate you a bit? Idk. I&#039;m just mentioning my preferences first because the movie fit those preferences. You&#039;ll want to keep in mind where I&#039;m coming from in case you think differently.<br />
<br />
The story initially has the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348075">
        appeals as the episodic stories in the TV series. The first of which is seeing Violet come into someone&#039;s life and change it for the better, which is to be expected. Another is the captivating emotions of the characters that Violet touches. However, the movie doesn&#039;t immediately capitalize on the emotional buildup the characters have as it did in the TV series because it has more screen time to draw it out. I think this would solve the pacing issue that people seem to have with the episodic format of the TV series even if I disagree with that being a big issue. The extra time also allows for the story to be devoted to more than one central character.<br />
<br />
Instead of using the themes of grief and loss to elicit emotion from characters and then the audience, it establishes a bond between characters that are forced apart and uses it for the emotional impact ... along with the great animation and OST that we know from the TV series. The letters written between the two main characters are wonderful. I can&#039;t really justify that statement ... because spoilers, but it just is. The way in which the letters affect the recipients is also shown to be consequential, so there will be more payoff than just that one captivating moment. But don&#039;t worry, that one captivating moment will come, and it will wreck you.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t have much else to say really. Explaining more than that would probably take away some enjoyment from the movie, so I won&#039;t. Hopefully, what I did explain didn’t already take anything away from it. If you liked the TV series in the same way as me then you will like the movie. Please watch it. Not enough people have seen this movie.

    After the disappointment that was to me Violet Evergarden (TV), I&#039;m pleased to afirm Gaiden is a nice step forward.<br />
<br />
The original VE was overly melodramatic most of the time, which contrasted a lot with some over the top scenes where Violet ran like Naruto while kicking asses, making me chuckle and hurting my suspension of disbelief on the process. Besides, due to Violet being a plain doll as a character (literally), episodes focused on her were the worst by far. Because of that, most of the series episodes consisted on Violet entering and trying to understand others concerns, growing her as a character at the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339639">
        same time because she can&#039;t sustain a full episode just by herself. Some of those episodes were good while others weren&#039;t that great.<br />
<br />
That being said, Violet Evergarden Gaiden is the best episode so far.<br />
<br />
This movie functions as a quite longer stand alone episode. It follows all steps of the formula but introducing some new narrative resources such as timeskip wich aren&#039;t possible in a regular lenght episode. On top of that, Violet has accumulated  all the knowledge of previous episodes, being a bit closer to be considered a human, to the point this is the first time I enjoy watching her. <br />
<br />
As I said, time skip is used here for the first time, converging past, present and future on the same story:<br />
<br />
▸ Past: An encounter in poverty. <br />
The weakest part, probably because the whole express adoption and Isabella being princess by surprise feels kinda rushed, but it could have been boring if it was longer so I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m complaining about.<br />
<br />
▸ Present: The doll is alive. <br />
We can see Violet and Isabella, a woman sick of everything, having fun and developing a friendship, which again, is new to the series and a step forward for Violet and the likeability of her character.  By far, the best part.<br />
(Noticeable how KyoAni has taken advantage of few yuri hints present here, to suggest something on the promotional poster in order to appeal to certain audiencies... as me).<br />
<br />
▸ Future: Closing the circle. <br />
Taylor finally appears, attempting to make a living working as postwoman, thinking that will help her eventually find Isabella. We get attached to Taylor through her difficulties and the whole drama behind her and her sister. The movie reachs its conclusion, the bittersweet reunion, through a letter of course. in a thematically befitting way.<br />
<br />
Violet Evergarden Gaiden, while solving some of the problems present on the original series, hasn&#039;t reached the full potential, but I&#039;m satisfied with it and willing to see what KyoAni do next.<br />

    This is basically like Violet Evergarden : episode 14. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m not saying you shouldn&#039;t see it; if you enjoyed Violet Evergarden this is a must see. Although this felt more like and extra episode than a movie to me.<br />
<br />
I just want to say that the artwork, as always for Kyoani, is extremely well done, and (miniature spoilers here) I just love Violet&#039;s white dress when Isabella dances with here in the ball scene. SOOOO MUCHHH that I might have been converted into a yuri fan. But like seriously, it is extremly beautiful and heartwarming. I mean, it is just good to see the Evergarden cast,

    Animation doesn&#039;t need much to speak about. Simply, it&#039;s as breath taking as what Violet Evergarden has been so far. It&#039;s a very slow movie with intimate character interactions. The movie has the same formate as an episode of the show, just played out longer. Violet has her time with the characters, we grow attached, and then we get the background that makes them interesting. Seeing Violet take her affect on the characters, as well as how they effect her is shown very well. It overall a very quiet and calm movie. It has it&#039;s very emotional moments, as well and some humor thrown in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330228">
        here and there. The movie shows more of the old cast of characters as well. Giving them more time is nice, considering they weren&#039;t given much time in the spot light before.<br />
<br />
If you are already a fan of this series, you will love this show. If you want an emotional tale, you can get into this. Love looking at beautifully animated scenes, this movie will leave you wanting more. And if you want to Support Kyoto Animation, this is a 100% must watch.

    Despite the calamity that happened upon them last year, Kyoto Animation&#039;s latest silver screen outing still holds to their standard. After having the chance to witness Violet Evergarden: Eien to Jidoushuki Ningyou last weekend, it still left a fragrant aftertaste even days later.<br />
<br />
The Japanese have a knack to make any mundane profession or activity into philosophical raison d&#039;être—just take a look at last years&#039;s Gaikotsu Shoten&#039;in Honda-san, and in this film they do basically that, but to the postal industry as a whole—and by proxy to the ghostwriting industry.<br />
<br />
As a background, Violet Evergarden tells the story of the eponymous character who were discharged from the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327683">
        military after her job being a Fortnite participantmilitary war elite field soldier is over due to the war is over and her losing her arms. During the event that resulted in her injury, she also lost her trainer who told her that he loves her. Since her military training made her detached from humane emotions—even to the point of her unable to comprehend her feelings towards her supposedly dead superior—her choice is to become a Automatic Memory Doll, a profession which basically is ghostwriters for the illiterate which is a lot in what seems to be post-world-war Victorian age. This film tells her story working in a private postal company named Claudia Hodgins Postal Company, shortened CH Postal Company.<br />
<br />
In this film, Violet was tasked to a reluctant heir of a noble family named Isabella York. Isabella was a student in a prestigious lady school who was having a difficulty adjusting to the suffocating noble lady life; Unable to go where she want, unable to do as she wants, and unable to befriend whoever she wants. Such lifestyle made her bitter to Violet who in her eyes is the polar opposite of her; a free woman. Despite so, Violet still act professionally towards her which gradually made the lonely Isabella to open up and even slide into the forbidden love territory—which many would deny but was strongly hinted with the lily flowers blooming imagery when they started to became closer and lily flowers withering when they had to separate, also one of the screening memento was literally a postcard with Violet holding violet lilies—but we&#039;re not going to talk about that m&#039;kay? Okay.<br />
<br />
The first half of the film is the process of making Isabella accept her new way of life and integrate into it. While doing so, make her open up about her past to Violet which revealed that Isabella didn&#039;t originally born with a pure noble blood. Prior to becoming a noble, her name was Amy Bartlett; a struggling proletarian and victim of the war. The bitter life she had made her unable to reject an unwanted daughter who she met outside a junk shop. Amy adopted the girl as her sister, named her Taylor Bartlett and the two started living together happily. Although one day, the Count York who had an affair with Bartlett family was in need of an heiress found her and readopt Amy into the York family. Despite living happily with Taylor, she knew that not accepting the offer is not beneficial to her and Taylor&#039;s life since the Count also offered to take care of Taylor to an orphanage. Albeit doing so requires her to separate with Taylor.<br />
<br />
The weight of that separation still carried to Amy&#039;s—now Isabella—new life. Understanding her new friend&#039;s feeling, Violet offered to put her feelings into a letter and send it to Taylor anonymously. Isabella&#039;s feeling reached Taylor and leads to the second half of the story.<br />
<br />
3 years later, a grown up—but still a kid—Taylor visited the CH Postal Company wanted to meet Violet Evergarden due to along with Isabella&#039;s letter, Violet also sent Taylor a letter on her own stating that if Taylor ever in need of help to meet her. Taylor and Violet met and she stated that she wishes to become a postman, since to her a postman&#039;s job is to deliver happiness. The early part of Taylor&#039;s new life is to adjust to CH Postal Company&#039;s inner machinery and learning the skills to do so. But the later part is how she wanted to send a letter to Isabella who has disappeared post her graduation from the school 3 years ago. Some time was spent into locating Isabella&#039;s whereabout using the postal network of the company and in the end, resulted in the pareidolic reunion between Taylor and Amy Bartlett.<br />
<br />
In terms of storytelling, the film achieved the knack I mentioned earlier and adhered to the sentimental style that Kyoto Animation has done with Liz &amp; Aoi Tori, and Koe no Katachi—and perhaps reminiscent to the early days of Clannad. It was atmospheric and solemn but also light. Personally I&#039;d say it&#039;s a balance of Studio Ghibli&#039;s renaissance and the modern Makoto Shinkai&#039;s storytelling, and made it mature. Mileages may vary, but despite it having tearjerking moments, it was just emotional at its own and I don&#039;t think it was forced.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t say the story is perfect, but it worked so well that it made the impression that it is. It&#039;s a good self-contained story that doesn&#039;t require deep dive into the whole world of Violet Evergarden and can be enjoyed by wide audience.<br />
<br />
And lastly, the art. Despite not as grand as Makoto Shinkai films, this film as its own charm. It portrayed the victorian aesthetics of the world quite exquisitely may it be the environment, fashion, and lifestyle. At some times it tried to blend CGI in and most of the time it doesn&#039;t look weird, the only scene that I feel lacking was an overhead shot of Isabella. It has a noticeably skewed background. Keen watchers may also find the logo of Kyoto Animation blended into some backgrounds, which was a bit sly.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Violet Evergarden was geared to be in the line of list of timeless anime due to how contrast it is compared to current mainstream taste, look, and story of the industry and it&#039;s doing good doing that. But again, only time will tell.

    Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou (2019)<br />
<br />
Once again we have another glorious segment in the world of Violet Evergarden. <br />
<br />
As we know from before the world she lives in is a harsh world with a wide divide between its people. However, as usual, we get to see the beauty hidden between the lines. <br />
<br />
This story like the others is wonderful and heart-wrenching. The story is simple in its nature but complex with the deep meaning to its storyline. From start to finish it kept up with a pace that was just perfect as expected from this series. <br />
<br />
The art of the world is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review340268">
        astonishing in its detail. Violet herself is still the most flawless character you could ask for. The green diamond pendant necklace is still a key feature to look out for when it shimmers when she acts emotionally. The world itself considering it has been through some major conflict is filled with curiosity. The detail shown with the divide between those wealthy and those poor is done with great care. The beauty in its being is done wonderfully.  <br />
<br />
The soundtrack that accompanies this movie being mostly the same as the series is just so perfect. I personally have the soundtrack on CD and it was a great move by me. The melodies are just so fitting to every time they are used. The world is given that edge over perfection with the soundtrack used. At times of emotion, it really brings you to the climax of your heart pulling out of your chest. <br />
<br />
Characters notably in this one feature Taylor Bartlett and Amy Bartlett (Isabella York) as the new members to the cast being that they are so poignant to the story. Violet continues her development as a wonderful character throughout the show and makes something of a big decision as shown in the end with the help she provided. <br />
<br />
The Amy segment of the film was really done well and then switching over to Taylor was expected but it wasn&#039;t expected to be such a deep part if I am honest. I totally underestimated her coming in. The ending has a nice resolution that brings the story with a great chance of a future OVA possibly and also if not gives such reasoning to read the material. <br />
<br />
I can say happily that I was content with how the film ended even as this is a side story to the main series. I honestly can say it brings out emotions that I perhaps do not display as much as I should whilst watching this series. Violet Evergarden is a beautiful work of art that deserves so much praise. I am genuinely grateful to the author that conjured up this story. <br />
<br />
An absolute masterpiece. <br />

    Another wonderful masterpiece by KyoAni &lt;3<br />
<br />
(Disclaimer: Even though it would be highly beneficial for you to have watched the Violet Evergarden series before watching this, I personally think it&#039;s doable to enjoy it regardless :)<br />
Also, I tried my best to prevent any spoilers from peeping through, but I write this review assuming you have watched the original series. There will be spoilers from the original series)<br />
_______________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
STORY: (10/10) - The story is somewhat of a continuation from where the series had left off. The war is finally over and the city is finally starting to build back up from the dark past it went through. It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review359868">
        revolves around Isabella York, a girl with a troubled past, trying to reach out to her long lost younger sister Taylor through Violet&#039;s expertise in writing down her client&#039;s feelings on paper. Although I&#039;d love to mention more, I feel like spoilers will inevitably be present. But in brief, a very solid job by the storyboard as well as the animators for being able to convey it so well.<br />
<br />
SOUND: (10/10) - We get the same beautiful soundtracks from the original series, but with a few more additional orchestrations in between, as well as a brand new ED which suits this story well. Splendid compositions from Evan Call! Without the music in Violet Evergarden, it would have such a drastic shift. Absolutely no complaints here :)<br />
<br />
ART: (10/10) - As is tradition of Kyoto Animations, each and EVERY single frame in the movie is just stunning! It is truly an experience just witnessing the extent of human creativity and talent through the time, love and care the folks at KyoAni puts into each and every single frame they draw. If you do not enjoy the movie, you&#039;ll definitely enjoy it&#039;s pristine art. I guarantee it!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: (9/10) - We do not see too much development of the characters from the series, but all of the returnees are played splendidly in the movie. My only complaint would be that the new characters (Isabella &amp; Taylor) did not have too much of an introduction to their past during their flash-back sequence albeit being well-made nevertheless)<br />
It&#039;s not really a fault that will break your enjoyment, so rest assured.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: (10/10) - I went into the movie with really high expectations, and was not disappointed in the slightest. It made my somewhat of a dull week into a beautiful one, and has left me with a deeper sense of appreciation for all the beautiful little things that life offers, as well as the treasures that we have as human beings - Emotions and Loved-Ones &lt;3<br />
_______________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
OVERALL: If you&#039;re in need of a breath of fresh air, or just wanna experience how beautiful feelings and emotions can be, look no further than to Violet Evergarden. It will take you into it&#039;s own world for as long you watch the movie, and will leave you with a sense of joy and satisfaction that will turn your day or week into a more peaceful one ^^<br />
<br />
Job well done KyoAni &lt;3<br />
よくできました! <br />
<br />
Happy watching ＼(*^▽^*)/
