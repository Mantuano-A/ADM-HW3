    This may be it, the tradition I have of writing a review for every single part of Non Non Biyori may have sadly reached the finale. But thankfully, it is a happy one and one that I can write while being proud of an anime that was able to make me happy and change my mood for the better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori is an anime that surprisingly got way better with time, what I thought would be a &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot; anime turned into something more sinister and one with a bigger dive into childhood and growing up. The anime never fails from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387608">
        surprising me with how emotional the smallest acts can be and how even saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; to your friend can have so much meaning. I&#039;m always amazed at how the anime manages to make me laugh from something so simple and how it draws a smile on my face whenever I see the glimpse of Renge in the background. I&#039;m always surprised at how cute Komari can be and how Natsumi can be so cute and funny despite the generic characters similar to her always end up being annoying. <br />
<br />
I love how the anime manages and build relationships between all the characters and its ability to make you love and care about these characters even with some of them having very little screen-time like Honoka and that other new cute little girl. The character depth is great and they do feel much more realistic than most shallow generic characters in some other SOL anime. <br />
<br />
ALSO, CHILDISH HOTARU!! Man, this anime really needed that. Seeing Hotaru actually acting her age and being spoiled has been a highlight I wait for every season AND IT HAPPENS TWICE in this one!!! TWICE!! 10/10<br />
<br />
The flow of time in the anime is great and the fact you feel the characters growing up is something done very well that it just feels natural and you recognize it specially when they are put in similar situations and how they changed the way they act and started showing more care to the situations. This can be seen easily with Renge tho I won&#039;t go in on that so as to not spoil the greatness of it. <br />
<br />
The sounds, art, animation and overall directing were great and combined with wonderful voice acting, it led to a fantastic anime and one of my all time favorites. <br />
<br />
Overall, I would give Non Non Biyori Nonstop a 10/10. A really wonderful conclusion to one of the greatest SOL ever made. 9/10 for the whole series as well. <br />
Would recommend the whole series tho I would advice anyone to try to go power through season 1 as it may not be something many would like.

    Over two and a half years ago in 2018 we watched the daily life of our friends for the last time in the movie &quot;Non Non Biyori Vacation&quot;, where they traveled together to Okinawa during the summer holiday. It&#039;s been almost six years since the entire second season aired, but all the wait was more than worth it in the end. In the winter season 2021 the studio &quot;SILVER LINK.&quot; gives us hopes for better times with the long awaited third season &quot;Nonstop&quot;. Welcome to the most idyllic anime series in history: &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot;!<br />
<br />
The exciting everyday life of our four friends Renge, Komari, Hotaru

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387591">
        and Natsumi continues “nonstop” in their small village Asahigaoka. Living in the countryside, what kind of interesting things can happen there? Indeed, the answer is: not much. There are no amusement parks, cinemas or any other attractions for children. But that is exactly the point that makes &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot; so special and that magically casts us all under its spell. Despite the few options, our friends manage to think up something new every day and have a lot of fun. They use their creativity and invent funny games themselves. They are always happy and satisfied with the opportunities they have.<br />
<br />
We know and love all of our four main characters very well. Everyone loves &quot;Ren-chon&quot; and her personality. She is very curious, but always considerate of her friends. With the introduction of the new girl Shiori, Renge can finally feel like a big sister. In Renge she has found a friend who helps her and always plays with her. Together they have a lot of exciting little adventures.<br />
The rest of the supporting characters are also very well known to us. I mean who doesn&#039;t like the real MVP of the series: Komari’s and Natsumi&#039;s older brother: Suguru. A real man with zero words but extremely important actions. That’s why I just want to point out the relationship that is extremely evident this season: Kaede aka &quot;Candy Store&quot; and Renge. Our 20-year-old owner of the local candy shop appears significantly more this season. In most cases, her appearance is associated with Renge. Sometimes she brings her sweets or at another time Renge visits her in the shop. Despite the age difference of more than ten years, it&#039;s heartwarming what a beautiful background story these two have in common. Although Kaede sometimes comes across as listless, inside she is always happy to see Renge. Already during her high school time, she reluctantly would care for baby Renge in place of her feckless onee-chan, Hikage. Renge always tells her about new discoveries. While Renge grows and has new experiences, Kaede watches closely over her.<br />
<br />
When it comes to art, &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot; is not necessarily about the characters, but rather the environment. It&#039;s perfect to see where all of this is happening. Everything is beautiful and peaceful. The idyll can be felt by every viewer. Their school is modeled after a real elementary school from Ogawa, Saitama. If you compare the photos with the animation, you are simply amazed. But even e.g every other crab, no matter how small, has been shown in detail. You can really only say that everything fits perfectly: The characters and the landscape, together they make up our beloved &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot;.<br />
<br />
Everyone who has already watched the other seasons of &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot; will surely have their type of music in the back of your mind. In &quot;Nonstop&quot; we hear songs that are in the same style. “nano.RIPE” is back with their OP song &quot;Tsugihagi Moyou&quot;. A song which gives you the feeling that a new day is going to start and new beautiful things are being experienced. The ED &quot;Tadaima&quot; is sung again by our four main characters. It&#039;s very pleasant to listen to. The music is relatively slow and relaxed, there is no rush like in the big cities. Everyone lives peacefully and happily with each other. This idyll is unique.<br />
But not only the songs have been selected perfectly, also the background noises from the small animals or trees can be heard clearly. Everything is so natural and beautiful. Together with the voices of the characters, it’s truly a masterpiece!<br />
<br />
&quot;Non Non Biyori Nonstop&quot; was certainly the seasonal anime I was hyped the most. It’s wonderful to see our beloved characters again after all this long time. Nothing has changed, everything stayed the way we know and love. The series offers us relaxed daily life adventures with even introducing a new girl. The deepening of the background stories was a heartwarming success. Life in Asahigaoka can definitely go on like this!<br />
I really recommend this anime to every slice of life fan. In case you haven&#039;t seen the previous parts, start with those first. The whole series of &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot; is a must watch!<br />
Finally, of course, I hope that one day we&#039;ll see a fourth season again. Hopes never die! <br />

    This review is spoiler-free but make sure you&#039;ve finished the previous entries of the Non Non Biyori series so you&#039;ll be able to understand what am I talking about.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know why, but Repeat, the previous season, wasn&#039;t as enjoyable as the first one. After finishing it, I felt like it wasn&#039;t funny and deep enough. I felt robbed. I&#039;m not saying Repeat was bad—it was quite good. But the level that was set by the first season wasn&#039;t reached by Repeat, for sure. Non Non Biyori is a masterpiece that may be considered the eternal classic, but I wouldn&#039;t say the same about Non

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387570">
        Non Biyori Repeat.<br />
<br />
This impression left me thinking Nonstop might be a fairly doubtful idea because the Biyori atmosphere had already been a bit lost by Repeat. Fortunately, I was wrong. Non Non Biyori Nonstop is a heartwarming comeback of the series. <br />
<br />
Being a slice of life comedy, its plot is truly unique and funny. Time flies and never stops, and &#039;Nonstop&#039; in the title ironically reminds us about it. Nonstop shows us that time changes everything around itself as it flows by, even in the fictional universe. Given that, we see the characters grow up like we do.<br />
<br />
As always, Non Non Biyori represents the daily lives of the Japanese countryside folk in the modern era. With new characters being introduced, Nonstop never fails to be funny, even though sometimes the outcomes are predictable right from the start. When this happens, the anime mostly relies on visual humour, and I don&#039;t see anything bad about this.<br />
<br />
Some people tend to think that the SOL comedy isn&#039;t required to have any depth in it. Nonstop IS about fun but not ONLY about fun. It is also about different characters interacting and sharing their points, opinions. That makes this anime a seinen. It&#039;s not silly and plainly simple. It represents the value of the people surrounding you—your family, your friends, your neighbours, and so on. It&#039;s a tale about both childhood and adulthood and the symbiosis of them, that&#039;s why there are characters of nearly every relatable age group possible.<br />
<br />
The characters are magnificent. I love them for what they are being. Even though the cast is mostly full of girls, Nonstop isn&#039;t moe, I believe. It&#039;s cute, but we&#039;ll talk about it later. Now, the characters. As I mentioned before, the new ones have arrived. At first, I was sceptical about this, but, as the series was going forward, I loved them and their interesting stories more and more. They&#039;re perfect for the setting.<br />
<br />
As for the old characters, I think they&#039;ve gotten really much development even under these twelve episodes. Nonstop was able to handle this big cast and don&#039;t flatten their personalities, traits, etc. It says a lot about how talented and experienced are the people that have produced this anime.<br />
<br />
The visuals have improved, and it is what I expected from the 2021 unwritten standards. The backgrounds have got a large amount of desktop wallpaper potential and sometimes they&#039;re even close to photorealistic. The characters have their own individual designs, images, expressions—in other words, what makes them unbelievably rememberable. The transition scenes between the segments of the episodes are imaginative. I&#039;ve seen some mistakes in a bunch of scenes but am sure it&#039;s forgivable, and they&#039;re going to fix this on the BD. That&#039;s a 10/10.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack rocks. The OP and ED are gonna be my favourites of all Biyori series if the sequel isn&#039;t coming out anytime soon. It&#039;s all thanks to nano.RIPE, whose notable works include the OPs for Jintai, Citrus and the previous seasons, and to the seiyuu of the main cast. The BGM matches the atmosphere all the time. It&#039;s very good. The VA is also amazing.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve enjoyed Non Non Biyori Nonstop. Yes, it&#039;s not perfect, however, it&#039;s definitely a step forward compared to S2, plus it is certainly not worse than S1, if not better than it. Nonstop is a gem and a major improvement since Repeat—that&#039;s a win.

    Few series can truly capture the feeling of childhood, the innocent wonder and curiosity children have towards everything, the refreshing feeling of every situation being new and exciting, and of course the hilarious antics children get up to with their friends. Non Non Biyori is one of these few series, and its latest season continues to deliver on some of the most enjoyable slice of life experiences that remind you of the simpler days.<br />
<br />
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
If you are watching this season then you generally have an idea of what the story is going to be about. Like previous seasons, it is the same

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387583">
        old story of a few kids living their day to day lives in rural Japan. These girls find pleasure in their day to day activities which may appear boring at first glance, however the girls manage to keep it lively with their creative antics, competitive sprit, and the absolutely hilarious situations they always wind up in. Most if not all of the situations in the show feel realistic and completely believable, yet at the same time the situations are exciting in a way that really captures how powerful new experiences are to young people. Small mistakes like breaking a potted plant, which adults would normally apologize for are covered up hastily until they finally implode, someone restraining themselves with a pair of toy handcuffs and knowing where the release button is, confusing a friend with a ghost during a camping trip, these are all situations that are quite realistic yet are very effectively depicted in a way that is exciting and dramatic to the cast.<br />
<br />
The show is heavily focused on childhood activities with a rural flavor, the girls go to a small school with mixed aged classes, enjoy summer festivals, help with gardening, and spend time camping. Nothing much of consequence happens in this series, but that’s fine, Non Non Biyori is about exploring the enjoyable moments in the course of ordinary life in a very relaxed atmosphere. Nothing about the story is extraordinary and that is the charm of Non Non Biyori, just sit back and enjoy reliving your childhood, all the antics and embarrassing moments included.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The background art for this series is always spectacular, every single time a background of the countryside is shown it’s a wallpaper worthy art piece that blows you away with how detailed it looks. The audience gets to experience the countryside in all its splendor, from natural views such as pristine rivers, beautiful plants, and farmland to intricately detailed rooms and houses that were drawn with a lot of research, everything related to the scenery has so much love and care put into it. The animation itself is not anything super special but its fluid enough that it doesn’t hurt the show, the background art though is what really makes the visuals in this series. <br />
Character design is as solid as ever, the girls all look unique and they all have their own moments of expressive facial animation and eye effects to convey their emotions. As usual they also have a variety of outfits as needed depending on occasion and everything they wear is colored excellently and suits the cast perfectly.<br />
<br />
The sound: 8<br />
<br />
The opening and ending, along with the entire OST and the nature themed background sound effects are all just so relaxing and pleasant. The sound direction in this series has one purpose, to further immerse the viewer in a relaxing country side and fill them with a feeling of calm, this purpose is more than achieved, it is exceeded in every way. The rain noises, the sound of the river, the sound of a gentle breeze, Non Non Biyori has achieved some of the most relaxing sound direction available in the slice of life anime genre. Throw in the vibrant OP to get the audience interested and relaxed ED to cool down after the episode, there are no complaints about the sound, overall 8/10 sound direction.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
It is the same lovable cast as always, Natsumi is as hilarious as she always was, Renge still being absurdly random, Komari still getting mistaken for being younger than she really is and of course Hotaru defying people’s preconceptions of her age and maturity. Expanding on the previously mentioned character points, Natsumi gets into trouble a ridiculous number of times this season and every single time its hilarious, the rare sort of hilarity that makes one pause the video they are watching because they cannot focus on the show due to uncontrolled laughter. Renge harassing another character with a frog and discussing spheres with a friend may be some of the most random discussions I have seen in anime, ignoring absurdist comedy anime, Renge truly reflects the spontaneous and nonsensical behavior present in kids. This season also had a lot more secondary character driven interactions with the main cast, Hotaru had her family show up, Natsumi and Komari interacted a lot more with Hikage who brought out some entirely new sides of our main cast and even the mother of the Koshigaya household got some decent screen time. <br />
<br />
There were also some welcome changes to the overall cast that improved character dynamics further. One major change to the cast involves the addition of 2 new characters, this addition has been for the better and these 2 characters add a lot of value to the show overall. The first is Akane a shy high school student who visits the town so she can hang out with Konomi who she looks up to, Akane adds an adorable Kouhai to the cast and helps explore the older characters in the series and gives the audience a depiction of how a normal city resident high school student would react to the countryside. This additional dimension is excellent for rounding out the cast with a shy girl who struggles to make friends, she adds an element of uncertainty whenever she interacts with the main cast since you never know how they will surprise her. <br />
<br />
The second addition to the cast is Shiori, the youngest girl in the show and a playmate for Renge. Renge for most of the series has had to interact with kids older than her or with Kaede who is an adult, it feels like Renge has been missing out on a proper childhood friend and getting along with someone who is around her own age. Shiori fills this void and gives Renge somebody who looks up to her, someone Renge can be a role model for and somebody who Renge can teach life lessons to. Allowing Renge to fill a reliable older sister type role adds a whole new perspective to Renge’s characterization and allows for a lot of new dialogue and exploration on how Renge would interact with somebody who has less life experience than her. Their interactions are absolutely hilarious and the odd philosophical discussions they have really remind the audience of curious kids can be and how they might see a bigger picture than many adults do.<br />
<br />
Overall, the cast is truly the highlight of this series, every character is well fleshed out and does not fall into a basic character type, instead they feel like real people with their own unique and often unpredictable thought processes. It is a joy to watch these characters grow, explore their world, and live their day to day lives, the cast solidly earns a 10 score for achieving a level of depth and development not expected of a relaxed all girls slice of life series cast.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori is one of the most pleasant slice of life series available, if you enjoy peaceful slow paced series where the focus is on cast interactions and the world is peaceful and immersive, then you will almost certainly enjoy this series. This particular season lives up to its predecessor movie and season 2 quite easily, it even exceeds the previous seasons in terms of cast due to the wonderful new additions and the expanded character interactions for side cast members. If you have not seen previous seasons, just go for it, almost everyone can enjoy this series and it is intended for all age ranges. As for fans of the series, if you haven’t watched it yet, you’re definitely in for a treat.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
<br />
This is probably the best slice of life anime around and is representative of everything great about a slow paced episodic series. With its exceptional cast, amazing background art, enjoyable story and for exceeding expectations once again this season, Non Non Biyori Non Stop definitely gets a 9/10 score.<br />
<br />

    When I heard that Non non was coming out with another series/season, I just had to start watching it&#039;s previous seasons and movie, and I&#039;m so happy that I did such. Because it&#039;s not only worth a watch, super enjoyable, but it got me ready for even more when it comes to Non non Biyori Nonstop. Because it leaves off where it last was. In terms of presentation, story, and it&#039;s lovely bunch of cast.<br />
<br />
Non non basically follows the lives of small town people, mainly the few adorable kids that are within it, and a few of the adult characters. Each one of them just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review376928">
        being wonderful characters, and each having their own charm to them. Even the one that doesn&#039;t speak at all, even he has his charm, it&#039;s well done in the sense, to the point that even though he doesn&#039;t talk, it&#039;s still fits so well. Much like the rest of the cast, they&#039;re all super lovely, you&#039;ll come to love them all. Can&#039;t say a bad word about them.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are what also do it for this show. The art is colourful and beautiful to look at, and really captures a peaceful image. Like with the sound too, you could fall asleep watching this. Not because it&#039;s boring, far from it, it&#039;s always entertaining. But the atmosphere, the presentation in both departments, just make it super relaxing. Like you could fall asleep to the background sounds. These sorts of animes are always welcomed for those reasons alone. A lovely peaceful show, filled with many antics that are both funny and entertaining. <br />
<br />
Safe to say, Non non is back in full swing, so watch it now! In fact, watch the previous versions if you haven&#039;t already. Seriously, you&#039;ll enjoy it so much.

    Non Non Biyori is one of my favorite series. Season 1 was great and Season 2 was even better. So I had high hopes for S3 but unfortunately they decided to highlight some of the most boring characters this Season.<br />
<br />
Renchon and co are still there, and this series prob has one of my favorite episodes ever (Ep 5) but focusing so much on the neighbour Konomi was a mistake IMO. She&#039;s a very boring older sister type and there&#039;s literally nothing special about her. Similar to Koma-chan, she&#039;s meant to be a voice of reason and a foil for all the other characters. <br />
<br />
The difference

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385438">
        is that Koma is actually funny because she&#039;s often the butt of all jokes and it&#039;s really cute how she&#039;s always trying to be an adult and failing misserably. Konomi on the other hand, is just borderline annoying because she&#039;s a perfect older sister that always has the higher ground over everybody else and is basically untouchable.<br />
<br />
In this season they also introduce another girl, Konomi&#039;s friend Akane. Now she&#039;s ok just nothing special. Typical shy girl that&#039;s always trying to get her Sempai&#039;s attention. The problem is this series already has a lot of great characters that people would rather see. I wish Hikage would get more screen time getting in trouble with Natsumi. Instead we got this new character that we don&#039;t really care about and miss perfect neighbour. The perfect recipe for boredom.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, the series is still great. It&#039;s just a shame that all the fan favorites are taking a back seat to characters we don&#039;t care about.

    Slice of life, a unique genre in anime. Anime like these are the ones that are very hard to find and feel something special while you watch it. The importance of having family in Clannad after story, the loneliness and depression of someone in march comes in like a lion, and the reflection of someone&#039;s life and make a change in a silent voice. These are rare experiences to find, and the beautiful animation, message of the story, and the characters all make for a masterpiece. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you an anime that I love so much and that is non non biyori

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387642">
        nonstop. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story-10/10 <br />
it felt episodic at first, but it&#039;s not. We basically have past events that connect with future events. We also meet new characters, and we love them. We follow these young kids&#039; lives and we basically connect with them. <br />
<br />
Art-10/10 <br />
Same character designs as the previous seasons with beautiful animation.<br />
<br />
Sound-10/10 <br />
The soundtrack is very good, and whenever a song plays in a situation, it fits in with it. <br />
<br />
Character-9/10<br />
As I said in my previous review, I love Renge; she&#039;s the show&#039;s best character. The rest of the characters I really like, I&#039;m actually attached to them. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-10/10 <br />
I absolutely love this show, and this season made me fall in love with the series. There were very wholesome moments in the show and it kind of made me cry when renge was saying goodbye to her friend in episode 10. this show never felt repetitive, and it was very calm, and the fact that it comes out on Sunday made me feel more relaxed since I mostly chill that day. <br />
<br />
Overall-10/10<br />
I love this season so much that it made this anime one of my favorites.

    Ren-chon, once again you make the day.<br />
<br />
Non Non Non Biyori is one of those things for which I would like to spend a day in the countryside having the same adventures as the protagonists, breathing fresh air and camping somewhere in the woods.<br />
<br />
Yes, it would be great to have that experience.<br />
<br />
But let&#039;s not get too long and start with this short review: You could say that third season  is a sequel to the previous two seasons. This time we will not have Hotaru for the third time introducing herself to her new friends (Renge, Natsumi and Komaru), but we will see a little &quot;after&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387587">
        of what has happened in the anime. When I say little is because it does not happen that long (Or it could happen at the same time as the previous two seasons).<br />
<br />
The anecdotes lived by our protagonists are quite entertaining, some are very funny, others are calm, and there is also a wholesome element. However, even though each story is different (And also different from the previous two seasons), the premise and atmosphere of Non Non Biyori Nonstop is generally the same as the other two seasons.<br />
<br />
But this season also adds new things that complement and make even more entertaining: Hikage and Konomi have a greater role in this third season and also Akane Shinoda, Konomi&#039;s somewhat shy classmate and flutist, is introduced as part of the recurring cast of Non Non Biyori. The synergy that occurs throughout the series generates a lot of laughter. If I can tell you my favorite, I would easily tell you that Hikage and Natsumi, this troublesome duo has brought me a lot of laughs every time they get in trouble with Natsumi&#039;s mother or clowning around with the rest of the girls.<br />
<br />
A characteristic of Non Non Biyori is its quite original stories. Unlike the slice of life focused on the city and school life, this anime tells us a lot about life in the countryside and it is interesting how the girl group manages to have fun and not see the life of the countryside as a boring lifestyle. Or maybe because we who live in urban cities maybe see life in the countryside that way *laughs*<br />
<br />
But I have only one complaint: Suguro, Natsumi&#039;s and Komaru&#039;s older brother, is also not speaking this season. I&#039;m sorry to disappoint you that it won&#039;t be possible either. Nonetheless, Non Non Biyori has a lot of good things to present in all these 12 episodes.<br />
<br />
As usual, a soundtrack composed of musical instruments is presented, where the accordion and the flute continue to take center stage. In fact, with Akane&#039;s intro, there are recurring episodes where we see Renge, Konomi, and Akane playing the flute and all of this overall lends it a magically calm atmosphere.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we have for the third time Nano.RIPE with the song Tsugihahi Moyou in a pop-rock style opening each episode of Non Non Biyori. The ending Tadaima would be performed by the main seiyuu after the main cast in their chibi form say goodbye to the viewer.<br />
<br />
With the final arrival of the Non Non Biyori manga getting closer and closer, many of us are going to start to miss Renge and company of the great anecdotes that they tell us every day. However, even if the manga ends, they will continue to live their adventures, exploring new things and having fun in their school life with the lazy teacher Kazuho and “Dagashi-ya” Kaede.<br />
<br />
They will continue to give smiles.<br />

    After 2 season and a movie we finally reach the third season and I will say this is probably my favorite out of all of them. I love each one more and more and this season why it&#039;s special? It introduces us to a few more characters who I love and brought back a friend from the earlier season in a special episode. <br />
<br />
If you want a wholesome slice of life type of anime to cure away your depression, this is the one anime for you! Though nothing special in story as it is just everyday life for a bunch of adorable girls, some reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387612">
        it works! Because of it&#039;s simplicity that we can just enjoy it for what it is.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori offer us a simple time in life that we cannot get back again. When we were younger, innocent and free, embracing life with pure enjoyment with those we call friends. Those were some of the best time though there will always be obstacle, we had these moments of just pure enjoyment and it present it in a simple but yet so fun to watch way. <br />
<br />
Though this isn&#039;t for everyone and mainly if you&#039;re this far you have to be at least a fan of this series because apart from that, just to watch this season to hate on it makes absolute zero sense. Since it&#039;s nothing different from what we were presented in the other seasons. We just continue to go on this adventure with the girls to school and everyday life. <br />

If you enjoyed the other two season, you&#039;ll continue to love this. As we get more girls added to the story just adds more wholesomeness to this already amazing series. And if we do get a season 4, we won&#039;t have our usual 4 girls no more, as we&#039;ll be with a 5th girl and let&#039;s hope we get one. <br />
<br />
I continue to enjoy and love this more and more. I do hope you enjoyed it as much as I did :) one of those pure and sweet anime that doesn&#039;t rely on fan-service. Just sweet innocent pure joy

    Humans are a canvas, painted by the colors, people around us, and Non Non Biyori conveys this message very well. This season was focused a decent bit more on individual groups of characters instead of the group dynamic of season 1 and 2. This would normally be very frustrating, but it worked out pretty well. Natsumi and Hikage have such a great dynamic, as well as candy store and Renge are two highlights, but there are many more<br />
<br />
Now as per the story, this season is the peak for sure. The backstories were told in a way that gave a lot more depth to the series

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401513">
        as a whole. Some themes of growing up are incorporated too very subtle but nonetheless well handled. The main moral of being colored by the people around you is present more then ever <br />
<br />
Artwise simple but decent, use of still frames is usually good but when it misses it really misses. Not much more to say<br />
<br />
Sound is like the rest of the series fantastic, it makes you feel very immersed in the environment, and I give it the highest praise for that<br />
<br />
Characters are oh so close to being perfect. This time around 2 new characters are introduced. One Akane, a high school student who goes to Konomi’s school, and another one named Shiori who is around Renges age. Shiori is perfect, someone who can relate to Renge, gives her a sense of responsibility, and is just plain bliss. Then Akane who is to say the least, pretty flawed for the fact that she serves little to no purpose. She is a carbon copy of Hotaru from s1, nervous adapting to change you get the drift. She serves as someone Konomi can talk to, and helps build her character. Only problem is, HOTARU IS RIGHT THERE THEY LITERALLY WERE DOING THIS BEFORE DROPPING OFF AND INTRODUCING A NEW CHARACTER. Akane is the definition of expendable, and it hurts that she took screen time from Hotaru who was great in the time she had. The rest of the cast is spot on, Renge, Hikage, Natsumi, and candy story all shone more this season while nobody else disappointed either<br />
<br />
I would give this a 9.5 for enjoyment, Akane made some points annoying but not enough to dock a point. This series is close to my heart, words can not convey how much, and this season shines oh so bright<br />

    very amazing heartwarming anime, i am lucky that i can watch this masterpiece, non non biyori always help me when i am stressed, <br />
<br />
this season, non non biyori nonstop is the best, of course all the series include ova and movie is the best too, but new chara like shiori and akane made this anime more enjoyable,<br />
<br />
the moment when ren-chon meet shiori is good, i am surprised how cute shiori voice is. when shiori say &quot;onee-chan&quot; to ren-chon, ren-chon expresion always impressed me, <br />
<br />
the joke is always the same, natsumi and renge really amazing couple, they can do the joke like they already prepare it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389686">
        before. <br />
<br />
Miyauchi family is the best family in this series, start from the teacher kazu-nee, always sleeping and lazy but her dedicated to teach her students is good. Remember when parents day, her and natsumi work together to impress natmusi mother, that so funny<br />
<br />
second is hika-nee, she just like a normal girl from myauchi family, she is high school now in tokyo, she can control her manner in tokyo, but when she go to hometown, she become &quot;normal&quot; again haha, the moment when she go around village just to get the new year money is really funny.<br />
<br />
renge is the best miyauchi member, her expression about everything is always exaggerated, but that the funny. she steal the role of MC from hotaru in my perspective. very close with kaede the shopkeeper, her backstory with kaede is really really hearthwarming, and kaede really love renge like renge is her own sister. Kazu-nee is crying when she is drunk and rambling about kaede take care of renge that touched me. <br />
<br />
there is so much i want to write about this series but the conclusion is THIS IS MASTERPIECE, the comfy, the heartwarming, everything is perfect. <br />
<br />
last word from me THANKS ATTO FOR MAKING THIS AWESOME SERIES.

    Non Non Biyori as a whole is a solid 10/10 for me; it&#039;s wholesome, funny, cute and ,for someone who has lived his entire life in the countryside, very relatable anime which brings the pros and cons of living in the remote yet peaceful village.<br />
<br />
The chemistry between different characters is just so funny and amazing, like between Candy store and Renge, Natsumi and Hikage and when the whole group is together. Even the Suguru who doesn&#039;t speak a word in the entire show is such a likable character. <br />
<br />
Non Non biyori was on my plan to watch list ever since the first season aired but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388969">
        I never seemed to have the time to watch it, since I had to catch up with all the old and new anime I missed before even starting to like anime. About a week ago I noticed that the last episode of the Nonstop season would be aired and thought maybe I should watch the entirety of Non Non Biyori in the span of the next week. And I loved every second of it, I&#039;m so glad I finally had the chance to watch this anime and wouldn&#039;t even think of not recommending it to anyone who&#039;s looking for a chill anime to lift their spirits up.<br />
<br />
Obligatory apology for bad English \._.<br />

    What makes anime so amazing is that you can travel to fantastical places without having to experience it firsthand and I can&#039;t think of a better example than this show. Living in the countryside is something that most people would agree they wouldn&#039;t want but watching this show I can&#039;t help but I can&#039;t help to think about exciting it could be to live there. The themes of the show are extremely powerful yet subtle which makes it both heartwarming and relatable. It&#039;s just as important to learn lessons from those who are older but also to help those who are younger and continue the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388696">
        cycle. The characters are all beautifully crafted each with their own unique personality which makes them all so lovable. The character designs and their facial features and gestures bring life to each character and it was a blast seeing how they all reacted in different situations. It leaves a sad feeling knowing that this is the end to this series but the way the show ended really does close the tale of these imaginary characters and how life works from seemingly unrelatable scenarios. This show is probably not for everyone but for those who enjoy a comedic and heartwarming slice of life series I would highly recommend this show.

    It pains me to see how very few people have watched this new season. In case you don&#039;t remember, there hasn&#039;t been a new season since 2015 but along the way, there was a movie to experience...yet i felt that i hadn&#039;t seen enough of these girls; i wanted to see what new experiences SILVER LINK. can bring with this set of characters, the wait was killing me! But alas, it is finally here. 6 years we waited and what&#039;s the result? Perhaps perfection is enough to say it. Non Non Biyori is probably the most underrated anime there is; so few know about it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review388122">
        and those who tasted it will tell you wonders. Each episode is a masterclass of imagination with these lovable characters; the best example would be putting a pair of handcuffs on one of the girl&#039;s hands and even the impossible can happen. They also feel very nostalgic, often will you see the characters doing childish stuff or learning new things everyday...for me, its a throwback to when i was little, always wondering if this day could bring me new adventures...a mutual feeling now, really.<br />
Characters are, like i said, very lovable. Each one of them are very quirky; they all act the same...at random. This is why i love them, you can never guess what things they will do even if you try your best to learn about them. Renge is the best example of this, you can do millions of things with her and it will always fit her character due to how well executed the comedy writting takes effect on her.<br />
<br />
Art is perfect, a great vision of the countryside i would like and the character design is aswell pretty good, love the way these characters look. They even take 1-3 minutes of the episode just to show empty spaces of the scenery; wether its the sky, water, flowers, animals, this anime has you covered. Music is again one of its highest points, its always something simple like a flute but very soothing to hear. Opening and ending musics are quite plesant aswell, they fit the scenery and the calmness that the anime gives you. Voice acting is a high note, they have fun in what they do and feel connected to these girls.<br />
This is why Non Non Biyori is the best at its type(Slice of Life); its capable of portraying the nostalgia of the stuff we used to do as kids while also presenting us the beautiful countryside of Japan. <br />
<br />
So, should you watch this 3rd season? HELL YES! Having the same style as the previous seasons, this one kicks it up a notch and makes nostalgia a dream for the future. I just wish i could go back to simpler times and enjoy life as these girls. Thank you for this experience.<br />

    As always a foreword before I begin. This review is based on the anime (Actually this one is true to all Non Non Biyori parts that are out to this date)and is subjective as all reviews are, but lend me some of your time and ears(well eyes woudl be more accurate here...) so that I can try to convince you why or why not this is an anime for you!<br />
<br />
&quot;Nee-nee, is that haute couture?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, I don&#039;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
We&#039;ll to be quite honest neither do I but one thing that I indeed know is that Non Non Biyori is one of the ultimate chill anime  and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387953">
        you need more of it in your life!<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story is centered around the everyday lifes of our protagonists. Which consists mostly of mischief and playing with a little bit off school life sprinkled on top. That ladies and gentleman would be all! Yes, that is that! To be frank this simple outline is done in a magnificent way and is complemented by other parts which we will get to in due time. No baffling with complicated plot, no pulling the wool over our eyes. Just simple, straight and fun.<br />
Some viewers might be discouraged by this but fret not. I strongly believe that the main point of Non Non Biyori is to get us to relax and carry us back to the good old times when We ourselves spent all day playing outside. Oh the times those were!<br />
Nothing is boring when you are with friends just like in Non Non Biyori be it a simple walk to school, going out bug catching (yeah we all done that be honest!) or making our own ultimate, secret base (due to reminiscing a single, manly teardrop was shed by the author at this moment...). <br />
<br />
Art<br />
From the tranquil mountains and forests to the rural village and homes Non Non Biyori does an excellent work depicting nature in all of its beauty. All this in all four seasons of the year. Much work was put into the environment and it shows. The countryside gives off a pleasant vibe, with a really detailed landscape that you want to wander off to by yourself. <br />
The whole story is centred around in one place but the coming and going of seasons really changes the overall atmosphere and vistas. Crafted with great care and with equally great diligence art is one of the best points of Non Non Biyori. <br />
<br />
Sound<br />
This is something that I like and I feel not a whole lot of anime do right. Non Non Biyori is not afraid to use silence to its advantage. A whole lot of scenes are filled with ambient sounds. Be it the sound of a small stream or the sound of cicadas. That creates an ambiance, that complements the art style to a great extent.<br />
Besides that we have music that&#039;s fitting the &quot;whole cute girls do cute things in a cute way&quot; shtick. Ranging from happy and fast to silly and funny. Overall the sound department is really well done. I gave it a 9 here only because no Intro or Outro song caught my ear.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
Our band of girls consists of: Miauchi Renge, Koshigaya Komari, Koshigaya Natsumi, Ichijou Hotaru which are supported by Miyauchi  Kazuho, Miyauchi Hikage, Kagayama Kaede and Koshigaya Suguru and a few others.<br />
Renge the youngest of the bunch has a really flowing imagination and she&#039;s one of the first that we meet. Always stoic but in a cheerful way. Spending her days equally on playing and studying. <br />
Komari a little girl with a big heart! Also a big complex on being the mature onesan one of the bunch (due to being one of the oldest from our main bunch). Frightful, clumsy but always there to help when she can.<br />
If Komari is the proper sister then Natsumi is the mischievous one. Always there when something happens (and breaks for that matter), the main source of pranks and fun activities. Natsumi is always on the move.<br />
Hotaru is a new resident who quickly became friends with everyone. Helpful, resourceful with an unhealthy fixation on Komari-senpai. Hotaru is frequently labeled as the oldest one in the group do to her proper, grown up style of being. But when no one watches she shows the pampered child side of herself. The main cast is frequently accompanied by the supporting characters for all manner of trips or activities. Kazuho being the teacher has to deal with the most antics whilst trying to pass on every little bit of knowledge she can. <br />
Non Non Biyori gives us a plethora of lively charaters to catch our attention. Equally busy with antics and school but always with eachother around to help out or simply sit around and do stuff.<br />
One thing here is do not expect some magnificent character building or trying to overcome weaknesses and so on so forth. This is just not this type of anime and for one thing it could discourage some viewers. But do not worry, do not fret give the gang a chance and who knows they could just steal your heart or at the very least end every episode with a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
The simple, guilty pleasure which is Non Non Biyori is grand. Episodes go by in an instant and you don&#039;t really know how but you just binge watched the whole season and want more. That is how they get you! But more importantly it really is a peacful, fun experience. I caught myself rembering childhood games and fun that I had and also all the places I always liked as a child (small town, with a lot of forest and animals around really hits home) and I would think that this will be a effect on most viewers. But this is not something for all. True that behind all of this is a simple plot, simple characters with no real culmination point, but does it always have to be?<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
To sum up I would really like to recommend this title to a lot of people. Even if those kind off things are not up your alley normally. Why not give it a try? Maybe you too will be carried to another place, a better place you know from your childhood(and memories of fun times). From my experience watching this show does indeed help with stress in its own silly way. Be sure to not await any twists or incredible turning points. This just isn&#039;t that kind off thing and to be honest good! I think that not everything needs to dig deeper and be profound all the time. <br />
So give this one a go and while your at it why not have your friend give it a go! After that why not reminisce of the time you were in school and done all those silly things together.<br />

Thank you all for reading and your time. If there is something that you feel I didn&#039;t put enough emphasis on or I&#039;m simply wrong feel free to message your opinion. Over and out!

    Mono no Aware refers to the Japanese Aesthetic on the passing of things. Of impermanence and the change in time. In a post-Aria world, Non Non Biyori gracefully inherits the torch, and come this third season, elegantly embodies the spirit of Mono no Aware.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been 8 years since I started watching the show, and honestly I didn&#039;t care much about NNB at the time, casually dismissing it as some SoL show that&#039;s really slow. 8 years is a long time for someone to change, and I&#039;ve grown old and miserable over the last decade. Having NNB around, rewatching the first season in fact, has made

          <span style="display: none;" id="review387581">
        me feel like such a fool with my earlier judgment. It really is the show you&#039;d appreciate more the older you are, ironically in a show where the main cast is JC or younger. You go from seeing them as your contemporaries to seeing them as either a memory of what you were before. It strikes a powerful feeling that is very potent to you.<br />
<br />
Non Non Biyori Nonstop is named thusly because is where the Non stops. Moreso than any other season before it, it&#039;s a season not only about goodbyes, but the importance on properly saying goodbye. In episode 10 especially, without spoiling much, you get to see this in action, rounding up a similar moment from episode 4 from the first season. That episode is so brilliant, you get to see the natural conclusion of Renge&#039;s character motivations and development, which (upon rewatching admittedly) was also touched upon Vacation&#039;s ending sequence, as she (and you, the viewer) learn the importance of properly conveying a goodbye. Actually, the last 3 episodes are all about closure and reminiscing. It&#039;s the point where you see the creative staff really outdo themselves and provide a proper ending to the series, and I&#039;ll admit the feeling of remembrance, of nostalgia, of the acceptance of the impermanence of life, is felt so strongly I nearly teared up.<br />
<br />
 Nonstop introduces two new characters to the cast. They don&#039;t change the dynamics of the cast too much, being relegated to mostly guest appearances, they do complement the show very well. Akane hardly has any appearances, but she does shine a light on how the greater world outside their village functions; her episode where she and Konomi tour a Matsuri in the city is a very non-NNB moment, but still enjoyable for what it is. Shiori on the other hand is a great complement to Ren-chon&#039;s character. It&#039;s refreshing to see Ren-chon interact with someone close to her age and the scenes resulting from this combination is very fresh as well.<br />
<br />
Moreso than previous seasons, the direction and scene composition is impeccable for Nonstop. Restraint is a key word here, as many scenes are given time to linger on and remain onscreen to further enhance the tranquility and quietness of it all. It does give you time to reflect on the events that came before, or to highlight the emotions that permeate throughout. It is near masterful, though not perfect. I do wish some scenes would either go on for much longer, or to have unnecessary dialogue silenced, but what we got was still pretty damned good. Only NNB can have a 20 second scene of a blue gradient and have it be meaningful and emotional. As Vacation has demonstrated well, it feels as if the creative staff behind the anime knows atto&#039;s series inside and out.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s hard to say goodbye, but one must understand the impermanence of things and the passing of time. It&#039;s ultimately what NNB is about, and as the manga and anime both come to an end, I am grateful for the journey it has taken me these 8 years or so, and I do hope for another series to take its place as it did for Aria. <br />
<br />
Thank you Non Non Biyori. And Farewell.<br />
<br />
9/10

    Non Non Biyori, and even moreso Non Non Biyori Repeat, took me by complete surprise and turned out to be an absolute masterpiece of character driven Storytelling. Unfortunately, Non Non Biyori Nonstop mostly failed to live up to the previous seasons, largely due changes in the character focus of the show.<br />
<br />
Nonstop is a show about Renge. If Renge was the main reason you enjoyed Non Non Biyori, then you&#039;re in for a treat. Renge features almost exclusively in 10/12 episodes of Nonstop. I believe that Renge works best when her innocence is contrasting to the more mature points of views of the other characters. That

          <span style="display: none;" id="review400304">
        dynamic is lost in Nonstop.<br />
<br />
In a secondary role, we have Natsumi and Akage, the latter becoming a regular for the first time. On the Tertiary Tier, we have the High School student Konomi and her underclassman Akane, new to the series.<br />
<br />
Notably, Komari and Hotaru are almost entirely absent, each featuring heavily in 1 episode (And together in another half episode.) If you enjoyed either, or the dynamic between them, you will not find that here. Despite being a Renge heavy season, Candy Store and her bond with Renge is relegated to a single episode, and even Kazuho hardly appears outside her capacity as teacher. While the group of 4 main girls does appear together time to time, no episode is devoted to the group in the entire run. In the end, all characters must step aside so Renge can get more screentime.<br />
<br />
Along with the lack of character focus comes a lack of character interactions. And from a lack of character interactions comes a lack of emotional storylines which made up the first two seasons.<br />
<br />
Nonstop is still worth a watch, but it clocks in at merely &quot;okay&quot;.

-the soundtrack also great and pretty chilled and suitable for the atmosphere.and I like all the op from first to final season that sang by NANO.RIPE<br />

-the characters was the strong point of this anime.every character have

        their own unique personality and the interaction with each other was just perfect.i like renge randomness but also a smart and matured kid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the chance for new season might be low and this is probably the last season.i think by giving 10 is the perfect parting gift for this beautiful anime that managed to make me laughed and conveyed so much massage.i  hope we might get an ova or movie soon at least.

    It&#039;s more Non Non Biyori what more could you want! It&#039;s just as good as every other season. This season continues with the series signature comfyness and nostalgic feel. Every time I watch I feel like I am a kid again and I remember all of the things we would do while outside playing.<br />
<br />
Compared to the other seasons this is mostly more of the same. Characters are still the same as they were in the past. The animation feels the same along with the sounds and the music. But don&#039;t take this as a bad thing. For this type of show that is exactly what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review390443">
        it needs to do. <br />
<br />
Sadly I must say I am disappointed. This season was advertised as &quot;Nonstop&quot;. However, I can confirm that it did indeed stop after episode 12. Don&#039;t let their lies decieve you!

    You can find happiness wherever you are even with the simplest way.<br />
<br />
Finally, one of the best slice of life anime finished. And its really sad for me, i really miss them, maybe i will rewatch them again someday xD.<br />
<br />
Story : For Non non Biyori Nonstop, the story is really beautiful and fun. But i can say that too with the first season, Repeat and Vacation. I really enjoy every seconds of it! &quot;Simple is the best&quot; thats the way i describe this anime, just a bunch of kids playing around and its really nice to see such environment. I love every episode in this anime.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review389695">
        (9/10).<br />
<br />
Art : I cant say anything about art, but i think they&#039;re really doing a great job with art and animation in the entire series. (9/10).<br />
<br />
Character : This is one of the best point from Non non Biyori, all characters really well made and i cant forget about them for years since the season 1 start. Renge is fun to watch and her Nyanpasu greet is memorable, Komari and Natsumi quarelling are always funny, also Hotaru cute side when she going with her parents are precious, Candy Store-san and the teacher are always nice to see them, dont forget about Suguru he is a great character even he isnt talking a lot, Konomi is such nice senpai and mature, i really like her. The new character addition (Akane and Shiori), both of them are really good characters and Akane flute playing is beautiful, Shiori is also cute and going along with Renge. I really happy when i see Honoka again and reunited with Renge. Overall i love all characters in this series so i can enjoy more. (10/10).<br />
<br />
Sound : Peaceful BGM is suit with this series, and NanoRIPE always doing a great job bringing rural vibes, its a fun songs. (10/10).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : Non non biyori is easily one of the SoL anime and one of my favorite, im the big fan of this series. The quality is top notch for a SoL anime. I love it, i will give this series (10/10).<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, if you like peaceful anime SoL and looking for a nice break after hardwork at office, school,, etc, this anime (ALL Non Non Biyori series) is the answer. I can say Non Non Biyori series is one of legendary SoL anime. Have a nice day!!
