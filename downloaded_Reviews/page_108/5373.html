Manaria Friends is set in the Shingenki no Bahamut world. Cygames used a gaming social event to create a manga/anime where we can appreciate the relationship between Anne, a human princess, skilled and genius with the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304171">
        magical powers and Grea a dragon princess, shy, with high physical strength. Since both personalities contrasts, the characters can shine in an unusual manner. For example, Anne’s loneliness is filled by Grea who sees her as a friend and not as part from royalty. We follow these two characters in the school life; they can get ill, they can get angry, they can cry, the typical student life. However, the story mixes those events with magic and other pleasant moments such as the delightful classical score. Also, the plot plays with the Yuri boundary. Sometimes we can have the impression that Anne is seeking a higher relationship with Grea, but I think that is called friendship. Loving a person does not mean that you want to have sex or to have a personal relationship, that means that you care for that person and we can observe that kind of involvement in this anime.  <br />
<br />
Another impression that you will have is the lack of plot. This issue is understandable because there is not enough source material for the animation, so Cygames recurred to some life events and created small stories condensed in short episodes. I do not see that as a problem; the series does not have the typical length, it does not need to follow the familiar series structure because they want to show some essential facts of the characters and they did it very well. Furthermore, this allows the series to have acceptable pacing from episode to episode. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it is hard to understand the reason for hate towards this series. The event in the game was trendy, and it was taken into a manga (2 Vols) and then into an anime. However, for the main anime series followers, the plot will be awful because there is no relationship with the previous series. The fans who are expecting to see characters from those series will be highly displeased because Manaria Friends is a side story and not sequel. <br />
<br />
The sound and art are marvelous. The drawings can have few ugly spots, but in general, the art is gorgeous combined with one of the best scores of the season. The camera movement and the angles are good and focus the most impacting moments of the series such as the face emotions and or special events. <br />
<br />
Finally, can we like this series? I like it. I understand several spectators can&#039;t feel any empathy for this kind of shows. The lack of a consistent plot or action sequences in a fantasy world is very negative. In general, the show delivers a beautiful relationship where the main characters express their emotions, and they focus on the meaning of friendship in a simple way that isn’t dull.   <br />

    Genesis impressed me, Virgin Souls bored me, and Manaria Friends made me go full UwU.<br />
<br />
Rage of Bahamut is quite mysterious. Despite seeing 3 anime series from the franchise, I still have no idea what the thing is supposed to be about. This time around all it has is cute girls doing cute things + cute monster girls doing cute things, spiced with fair slice of yuri undertones, over-the-top comedy elements and some sort of weird-but-kinda-cute remarks about being self-conscious over your dragongirl hybrid body. All this presented in the iyashikei (=healing anime) format. <br />
<br />
Our &quot;plot&quot; itself is rather simple. Princess who feels she is somewhat

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304169">
        useless and who seems to go thru some level of solitude discovers that our dragongirl is in relatively similar spot, followed by them simply starting to develop a friendship and accept themselves/enjoy life via this relationship of theirs. Manaria Friends heavily relies on its atmosphere and its meaning in the story-telling is vital to comprehend what the characters are feeling. This approach has rather fresh feel to it.<br />
<br />
The art heavily relies on waifugame, be it in forms of shaky legs and stockings, watery and sparkly eyes or awkward blushy dragongirl poses, details in art exist to to give value to the female body in somewhat pure and adorable manner. Occasionally just lewd, but most of the time much closer to 2pure4this world. Similarly, even the backdrops are used in purpose of reflecting our casts&#039; emotions to a point that it could be said everything in the series exist in the purpose of our two main characters. The art itself is phenomenal, and one good reason to give this show a try is definitely its production values. These are literally the only times when I wish to go back to 16:9 aspect ration just to background image the shit out of these. <br />
<br />
This might raise a question &quot;is it any good tho?&quot; And it is a good series in quite a peculiar way, but at the same time it does quite seem like a series that mainly pleases a niche audience. It&#039;s a simple story about simple problems that have a simple solution to them. Its execution doesn&#039;t do anything in a very in-your-face outstanding way, our characters&#039; reactions are quite predictable once you get to realize what type of a series this is, not much of substance is to be found story-wise. The music is often following a safety route -- not that it doesn&#039;t work -- and many parts of the series are quite literally screaming &quot;do this because this is how it is often done.&quot; But it has its own magic. Scenes where our cast leaves the dining table, walk away from it and start a dialogue whilst the camera is still locked on the earlier scene while sunlight starts to hit it, feel almost poetic. Other times, the incredible happiness that our characters witness is enough to carry most of the content. Those who notice these type of details like a good senpai would, will have their chances of finding certain levels of significance from them and being left with rather wholesome aftertaste. <br />
<br />
Perhaps Manaria Friends is demanding a certain mindset from its viewers harder than most series do. It&#039;s even likely that I would have come to dislike it as whole if I had noticed it cons before its pros, but as it stands, the series is beautiful and I see no reason to release this review with a lower score for I enjoyed the show a great deal. Watching it simply made me happy, it&#039;s near soul-cleansing experience + these girls are just too precious.

    For a show about a psychotic lesbian stalker and her oblivious victim/pet, Manaria Friends turned out to be a lot more mellow and hollow than I would have wanted or liked. Manaria Friends is a show about nothing, it is a show where princess Anne and Grea say each other&#039;s names to themselves at least 3 times per episode and yet is too afraid to commit to an actual confirmation of their relationship beyond subtext and teasing. <br />
<br />
Coming into the show expecting to see the relationship of future Empress Anne and Grea is a task in its futility. As said earlier, beyond some occasional psycho

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304178">
        lesbian stalker moments, the show never really has a full grip on what it wants to call the duo&#039;s relationship with each other. Are they just very good friends? Who knows. The show apparently isn&#039;t interested in knowing either. <br />
<br />
Even with such weak characters and plot, Manaria Friends does excel in one regard. Relaxation. The slow pace and focus on the environments as well as long drawn out shots of either of our protagonists soothes the mind and is the perfect remedy for a hard day in the office. Background art is vividly detailed with just the correct lighting and color palette so that it doesn&#039;t overstimulate the senses.  The brilliant soundtrack too, immerses one fully in the world of Manaria, inviting the viewer to join in. <br />
<br />
Despite its misgivings I still thoroughly enjoyed my time with Manaria Friends. But I&#039;ll have to look elsewhere to get my yuri cravings. It&#039;s an alright show if you know what you&#039;re getting into, a relaxation aid with the occasional scene here and there to tease on potential romantic developments with Empress Anne and her pet Grea that will never come. Oh well. <br />

    In short, this anime brings nothing of substance and is just plain boring. Not sure why I see everyone else handing it out a perfect 10.<br />
<br />
We primarily follow along two characters named Grea and Anne, as they live in this somewhat generic fantasy world. Anne is a lonely princess, and Grea is a blushing dragon. They attend a school, and... I guess they go places together. Their relationship is either two friends just hanging out, or some sort of yuri bait. There has been no character progression anywhere as far as I can see, except for this paladin dude who is entrusted to protect the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301374">
        princess, who loves following her around, and nothing more. Sure this may just seem like your typical slice of life set in a fantasy world, but in all honesty, I don&#039;t experience a single enjoyable aspect in regards to any of these characters interactions/adventures.<br />
<br />
Direction wise, we are constantly given classical background music and some pretty shots. However, this pretty much makes up the whole show, and there are just so many of these shots that have characters and scenery with nothing going on in them, being standstill in attempt to make something look pretty and or meaningful. Again, classical music played in the background while little to nothing going on in the scene or moment automatically make it beautiful or a 10/10 for the OST.  There are also often many unnatural pauses between dialogue and scenes, making it painstakingly boring and just to make me ask the question, why? Perhaps it&#039;s seemingly trying to aim for something more than it&#039;s worth, but I don&#039;t see the value.<br />
<br />
Overall, this show is just filled with constant blushing and gasping from a dragon girl, and a non-existent plot that revolves more around some shots of scenery and characters going through things. I know I sound like I am repeating myself by this point, but there really isn&#039;t much more to add. In episode five, we are suddenly under attack by serious enemies, and then suddenly in episode six, we are just chilling at the beach. Even when an attempt to represent some sort of adventure or goal in the show, being that Anne has to help Grea in episode two, in the end, it renders useless and wastes time, just like the rest of the show does.<br />

    I really cant find any fault in this to be honest and seeing such a low rating for such an amazing anime is hard to take in. This is that one underrated show that didn&#039;t get the attention and praise it deserved and is definitely worth the watch.<br />
<br />
Story/Characters 10<br />
The story isn&#039;t really that intense or serious (atleast so far), since it revolves around the daily lives of the main characters, Grea and Anne, who experience different things as their friendship slowly deepens. The bond of friendship between Anne and Grea is just beautiful and so calming to watch that it&#039;ll turn your mood from good

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301347">
        to bad in an instant.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound 10<br />
The Art is just outstanding , literally every scene is a feast for your eyes.The characters are designed flawlessly and the amount of detail to the background and the surroundings is just amazing. The colors are bright,stunning and perfectly suited to an anime related to magic. The sound is also amazing and it wouldn&#039;t be the same without the sound. The OST is so calming and relaxing and when its mixed together with the art everything gets even better.<br />
<br />
Overall 10<br />
I would definitely recommend watching this and i can say that this is and will be one of my favorite and most memorable shows for this season.<br />
<br />

    What if I told you that there’s a school for gods, humans, and demons? Mysteria Academy is such a school where these races can all unite together to study in peace. Cygames, known for their innovative game projects, bought the Rage of Bahamut social game into anime form a few years ago. Now it’s Manaria Friends’ chance.<br />
<br />
Notoriously known for its production issues, the series was delayed for several years since its announcement. It’s a bit unusual considering the show isn’t even full length (12-15 minute length episodes). Yet, it took nearly 4 years for this to make it onto the TV screen. Given its context,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304168">
        you really shouldn’t expect this show’s storytelling to be similar to the original Bahamut series. This is more of a fusion of supernatural, magic, school life, fantasy, and perhaps a little bit more…<br />
<br />
Despite my experience with the previous Bahamut shows, watching Manaria Friends felt like a breath of fresh air. It’s known for its cheek humor, fan service, relationship development, and slice of life storytelling. Mysteria Academy itself has a rich history and we discover the depths of its secrets. However, what attracted me the most to this show are the main characters: Anne and Grea. As a human princess, Anne is known for her academics and social status at school; think of her as a role model. On the other hand, we meet Grea, a half-dragon girl with a mystique and peculiar personality. Throughout the show, it’s no secret that their relationship develops and reaches deeper levels that goes beyond than just fellow classmates.<br />
<br />
It really isn&#039;t rocket science to figure out that Anne is attracted to Grea. Early in the show, she is fascinated by her beauty and ability to shed skin. The amount of blushing is also clear evident that Anne likes Grea more than a friend. Even when they’re not together, Anne is constantly thinking about Grea or adding her name into conversations. A more symbolic example occurs in one episode when the two are on a boat date. In one particular scene, the two gets intimately close that strongly builds the “ship tease”. As such, fans of shoujo-ai should be delighted about the direction of this show. However, anyone expecting a serious plot will be disappointed. Even with one particular mid-season episode that features a goblin/golems invasion, more than half the series consists of lighthearted slice of life. The comedy makes up a bulk of the series with its character interactions and goofy character cast. This includes clumsy girls like Lou who often makes a fool of herself with her klutzy behavior. <br />
<br />
But as a fantasy slice of life, I should warn you to pretty much accept the anime as it is. What it advertised is what you’ll get. And despite the years of delay, production quality remains generally the same as I remember from some of the key visuals and early teasers. Don’t expect your mind to be blown away. For a 10 episode anime, there’s not much home to write about the plot in the end either. Treat this as a slice of life with doses of girls romance and mix of fantasy. Cygames’ meta verse world is complex and Manaria Friends has a spot in its place.

    This anime is surprisingly good in a way I didn&#039;t expect it to be.<br />
<br />
In term of story, It don&#039;t have an overarching story and nothing major happens because it doesn&#039;t has to. It&#039;s just a slice of life in it purest sense.<br />
The plot summary can be describe briefly as &quot;Anne and Grea are student of magic school and they are flirting in every episodes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Characters so far don&#039;t have any development at all which is fine , again, it doesn&#039;t has to. Because the two main characters have a great chemistry between them and that&#039;s sort off the point of this anime, that&#039;s why I don&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301421">
        think development is necessary. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer : I myself is a yuri fan but I still try to interpret characters relationship with objective standpoint. And objectively speaking, Grea and Anne are pretty gay. I&#039;m pretty sure straight people don&#039;t act like that toward their friends.<br />
<br />
The thing that I like about the two main character&#039;s relationship is that, they are pretty gay but it&#039;s not in-your-face level. it&#039;s not even shoujo ai level of gayness. Because romance isn&#039;t the main focus, so why bother slam yuri to the audience&#039;s face. Right ?<br />
<br />
The art style is stunningly beautiful. All the scenery got details and texture to them, the color toning is appropriate to overall mood of each scenes. There&#039;s nothing jumping out or distracting. And the character drawn and animated beautifully, not overly &quot;moe&quot; or anything.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack got a decent amount of details and fit in smoothly with the scenes and the voice acting is decent.<br />
<br />
Every technical aspects of this anime are outstanding and don&#039;t have any flaws but also didn&#039;t exceed very far. That&#039;s why I give it a 9/10.

    You&#039;re here because of the &quot;tail meme.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shut up, you are.<br />
<br />
What is this anime about?<br />
<br />
So there&#039;s a princess, Anne/Anna (her name doesn&#039;t matter). She goes to a quirky magic school (shut up) despite having enough magic power to already nuke a continent. Why? Because she wants to bang a ridiculously hot Dragonoid girl, Grea.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s it.<br />
<br />
What, you were expecting insight into the Rage of Bahamut universe?<br />
<br />
No, this is HDGDMT--hot dragon girl doing mundane things with Annie/Anne, whatever, the other chick who really wants to bang her and neither of them mind but this isn&#039;t a hentai.<br />
<br />
The best part is that the anime doesn&#039;t care, they know what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301702">
        you&#039;re here for and they know that this will be meme&#039;d like crazy. Gif meme fodder the anime.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess I have to justify the score<br />
<br />
Story: there isn&#039;t one.<br />
<br />
Art: beautifully animated, like way too good for a TV show, like they made it 15 minutes to save up money. Given the terrible off model shit that&#039;s been popping up, this is DVD remake/repair quality stuff. The piano episode knocks it out of the park.<br />
<br />
Sound: really amazing score, way too good for the subject matter, like a nice steak at a dirty truck stop<br />
<br />
Character: thicc dragon girl Ms. Fanservice who gets a thiccness upgrade.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: if this isn&#039;t a guilty pleasure anime, I don&#039;t know what is<br />
<br />
Overall: you know what you&#039;re here for, if you don&#039;t like it leave seems to be the overall gist of the creative staff.

    Magical Princess girl flirts with Dragon Girl - The anime.<br />
<br />
The premise doesn&#039;t sound that bad on paper, I&#039;ll be honest. Since that&#039;s the main draw of the anime let&#039;s talk about why it doesn&#039;t work. Plain and simple: Grea and Anne - or whatever the princess&#039; name is - are boring and generic as all hell and WILL bore you to pieces. <br />
This anime is also really misleading. I was waiting for some plot to happen because situations are presented where it looks like the characters are in some serious danger. I thought &quot;Maybe the characters start off flat and boring but get more nuanced

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301922">
        as more things happen to them&quot; but no, because any time any sort of interesting situation is introduced with any stakes, it is quickly shrugged off and revealed to not be actually anything important, so the characters end up learning nothing from it. <br />
There&#039;s this episode where Grea replaces her skin and gets long hair, but the next episode. Literally the NEXT episode she has short hair again because &quot;she cut it again&quot;. 0 progress was made - her personality doesn&#039;t even change, so what&#039;s the point?<br />
The experience above sums up the entire anime. Nothing will happen, so what&#039;s the point of watching these two planks of cardboard dick around in a magic school?<br />
<br />
Slice-of-life anime usually relies on the character&#039;s personalities and relationships with each other to keep you hooked and wanting to see more of them. This anime relies on fucking nothing - there&#039;s literally no reason to keep watching other than my friend thinks it&#039;s a really funny joke because I said &quot;oh this anime isn&#039;t that bad it looks pretty good this may be a hidden gem&quot; after episode 1 because the art was nice and the plot looked like it was going somewhere, but when episode 2 ended I realized what a mistake I had made - but it was too late, now I&#039;m being forced to watch all of Manaria Friends, please send help.

    Ok, so first of all is it Manaria Friends or Mysteria Friends??? Cu&#039;z either way the title doesn&#039;t make any sense given that this was taken from a game, and by the looks of it , the game itself it&#039;s basically a galge game and what we&#039;re watching was the animated version of the game. Not surprising since that producer Cygames with the cooperation with Happinet were mostly in the game business and animation was only secondary to them, it didn&#039;t help at all with Sentai Film works on the helm of the production , since what we see was more like a yuri relationship

        between 2 princesses , one a human and the other a half dragon/human, now given that this was an anime based from a game, well, definitely there is no story plot around here, in fact any climax you see here will one way or the other be a train wreck cu&#039;z the story part basically flip flops from Grea avoiding Ann , to Grea wanting Ann, and there is Ann at one point would be this female Stalker to this sweet loving lesbian girl. The sound was just as terrible, cu&#039;z Anne&#039;s seiyu Hikasa Yoko doesn&#039;t sound like Hikasa Yoko, actually it was Grea who sounded like Hikasa Yoko even though the character&#039;s seiyu is Fukuhara Ayaka, it would have been better if Grea&#039;s voice was done by Hikasa Yoko and Anne&#039;s voice be done by Fukuhara Ayaka...or maybe some one made a fucking mistake where the one&#039;s who voices who weren&#039;t what the info indicated. Ya know jaz watching this was more like a chore than anything else , in which one would be doing some fanservice hunting than anything else. So without anymore BS, here were my ratings:<br />
<br />
Story-Poor 3: It doesn&#039;t have any, since the plot was just like something taken by some one who is a backseat player of the game.<br />
<br />
Art- Very Good 8: Cu&#039;z of all the eye candy and in fact anybody who give this a 10 to 8 were just into them eyecandy and nothing more, since there is only a one time Grea fanservice here.<br />
<br />
Sound-Pathetic 1: Cu&#039;z Grea sounded more like Hikasa Yoko than Fukuhara Ayame and Anne don&#039;t sound like Hikasa yoko, somebody made a mistake around here.<br />
<br />
Character-Poor3: Cu&#039;z even if it was just Grea and Ann all the way, one would feel like that they&#039;re just characters in the game, where they both go in circles. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Pathetic 1: Watching this is like having sex and as one was about to cum, suddenly something or someone ruins it and all that cum starts to rush back into the backstage.<br />
<br />
Overall- Poor 3: You&#039;re better off playing the game than watching this. jaz saying.<br />

    Anime Review No.1 2019 Version<br />
<br />
Manaria and Friends or &quot;Mysteria Friends&quot; still baffle me on what purpose it was made. Nobody asked for this. People wanted to have more high quality epic quest and explosive action but we get the total opposite it still set in the same universe of the title it base around however  the only motivation I will have to watch it is that it&#039;s related to Shingeki no Bahamut which by the <br />
way a good show and must watch if you have the time after reading this review.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art ( 6/10) Above Average<br />
<br />
Right of the bat that show is already promising in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308400">
        production value. Good Color Palette, Interesting character design but sometimes it&#039;s feels unoriginal if your going to base their design on certain archetypes. The background is really gorgeous and beautiful. This is my friends what Mysteria selling point and strength is. For a Slice of Life Anime it will actually work well but then it won&#039;t blend to much to the character and the setting the universe is base around. Frankly the background design can be shove to any anime with Harry Potter Style of School and nobody will notice the difference and so Manaria Art Style and beautiful setting is also plain forgettable because nothing of impact it delivers both the character and the story which is sad that if this atmosphere dynamic was used properly then Mystria Friends will be a magical of an experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound (5/10) Average to Fine<br />
<br />
The score is great and relaxing no question ask and no denying it matches the art style and atmosphere especially the ending credits feels like your old movies playing in the background really feels like slice of life but that&#039;s the only praise this show going to get from me honestly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plot (3/10)<br />
<br />
If you are looking for an interesting or engaging story you won&#039;t get in Mysteria Friends even for an average slice of life where you see character slowly grows and develop while the same time have good grasp of the people or the side character that surrounded them. They did actually tried to introduce this character and have a few seconds and less than 5 minute to know them but sadly the show focus spending most of the screen time on Grea and Anne which only show mild and shallow interest in relationship they blush a lot,  stare at each other, give small dialogues on each other and stuff and that&#039;s it. Too bad the show did actually present some interesting action but it is not fully utilize a Slice of Life with a few action here and there combo, doesn&#039;t actually sound bad, it even make the show somewhat memorable and more enjoyable than dawdling 15 minute breakfast time anime where the moment you finish eating the show ended and of to work. This is how I watch Mysteria actually to be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters (3/10)<br />
<br />
Mysteia Friends is the title of show so from that I have the first impressions we will get episode by episode that each minor character will be introduce and presented as folks living in the magical school. I expected for each character introduce we will give a brief and clear understanding on how the world and daily living work in Mysteria Friends. I urge to learn how do they learn magic, how different is a magical school from an ordinary school in the real world, how humans, mystical creatures and &quot;DEMONS&quot; interact with each. With this question in mind, Mysteria would be a promising show but in the end as I mention before we get more Grea and Anne spending a huge amount of time on the same place or botch around on a secret place where nobody will ever bother to go there.<br />
<br />
For Side Character Impression:<br />
Frankly I don&#039;t even know or even remember at this point the names of the side cast. All I can remember is the elf ear girl, the loli racoon looking fox, the sensei who is obsess with cosplay and this cool looking body guard who stalk around in the background. Yes this how I see the character which literally explain how poorly they are portrayed in this series even though they deserve better<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Cast Impression:<br />
This how I can describe Grea, She is a humanoid dragon princess meaning half human and half dragon that have huge dragon tail and horns. She shed her skin like she is going on mensuration and she blushes around Anne even on the most mundane conversation. She is shy to sleep with other people especially with Anne because she hugs her tail and finally she is very strong because she have dragon blood of course. And that&#039;s about it. <br />
<br />
And Anne personally I don&#039;t see anything new on her personality. She is genius prodigy that can cast high level spell, she is royalty, respected and love by the people. She make rash decision that counter her position as a princess, she can&#039;t swim for some childish reason. And lastly she is madly crazy for Grea for no any background reason to tell why they have this so called deep relation ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
My final thoughts about the characters that they are shallow. Nothing significant changes them in the span of 10 episodes for them. Looking back to episode 1 and episode 10 nothing actually change in the story except for graduation and that&#039;s it. I don&#039;t get any sort satisfaction on finishing mysteri nor a sense of accomplishment. It only just ends and surely enough this anime will just be forgotten and fans will just watch it because of Rage of Bahamut is attach to it alternative reference. It sad this show can potentially show the other side of the story without the epic battles and quest. But in the end all we get is forgo-table Slice of Life Fantasy anime that people wouldn&#039;t care after finishing it, unless your into the lesbian princess x dragon girl fetish.<br />
<br />

    This is the first time writing a review but some of the other reviews simply don&#039;t give this show justice. <br />
<br />
Story- I think that the story is a 4/10 overall when taking account the whole series in an overarching fashion and each individual episode together. There is no overarching story to the show which is important to know going into this anime. This makes it unfair to judge the anime on storyline because they didn&#039;t intend the show to have a linear story. However, each episode has its own unique story with clear beginning middles and endings for the most part. <br />
<br />
Art- The art style

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302403">
        is beautiful and well done, it is clear that people put their very best into this anime. 10/10<br />
<br />
Music-Watanabe Takashi is a genius who knows exactly how to set the mood and feel for the whole episode and series. I love the ending credits song especially while it slides through pictures from that episode while credits are on top of them. 10/10<br />
<br />
Character-The characters are developing beautifully within each episode and is more than enough development in the overarching story imo with the main characters those being Anne (a princess) and Grea (half dragon half human). With these characters, their sense of friendship can be seen when they get closer as friends, as well as problems (albeit small) they have within themselves. 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-its hard to put a rating on enjoyment because not everyone likes the same kind of anime. This anime is not for someone who wants an overarching story spanning every episode and seeing how it gets developed over time. This anime feels like a light fun anime that I just fell in love with. 10/10<br />
<br />
overall-10/10 This anime is great for people who don&#039;t necessarily want an overarching story or want to see deep developments in any characters besides the main 2. But overall this anime is light fun and I recommend watching the show. If I had to choose one episode to represent this whole anime it would be episode 4 as it helps you feel more with the characters and their emotions and is filled with lovely art and music.<br />

    Tsundere dragon and hyper-lesbian princess trying to be cute in what is mostly a slideshow as far as animation goes and lots of &quot;almost-moaning&quot;, because it&#039;s not like the 2 main character will ever say a single complete sentence to each other. In fact, you will likely never hear them say anything other than each others name with shiny, shy eyes.<br />
<br />
Something as simple as pulling up a thigh-high within the first 5 minutes of this anime has very deep philosophical implications and you&#039;ll have to be very cultured to understand the underlying existential question imposed by it, such as: &quot;This makes me sad about myself,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303748">
        why am I watching this?&quot;, &quot;What the fck am I doing with my life?&quot; and &quot;I will never have a thicc dragon waifu tail to use as a pillow, so why even live?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly, this is Anime of The Year... no, Anime of The Freaking CENTURY.

    I am uncertain why I give this series such a high score. Probably because of the fact that I&#039;ve been revising for an entire week constantly without watching a single anime up until today? Or on the other hand it maybe because this show is essentially a serene Yuri series. I don&#039;t know precisely how I feel about this anime, but I do realize that it feels somewhat soothing and chill.<br />
<br />
Story : 7/10 <br />
Nothing much, I don&#039;t even know what the plot is. Or is there even one? Throughout the whole series, all the episodes are just &quot;ok&quot; and I don&#039;t really see anything interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308997">
        at all. I&#039;m pretty much speechless and have no idea what I should write about the story anymore. <br />
<br />
Not a lot, I don&#039;t comprehend what the plot is. Or is there even one? All through the entire series, every one of the episodes are simply &quot;alright&quot; and I don&#039;t generally find anything intriguing at all, but at the same time it gives out vibes that makes it not boring. I&#039;m essentially speechless and have no clue what I ought to write about the story anymore. <br />
<br />
Art : 8/10 <br />
The art is good and can be compared to several famous anime series out there. I approve. <br />
<br />
Sound : 7/10 <br />
The sound is okay, nothing makes it stand out or turn it into dissatisfaction. There&#039;s also no opening and ending song ( I think ) which made me quite astounded. However, it didn&#039;t trouble me since I for the most part skip them anyways. The background music is moderate, and so does other features. <br />
<br />
Character : 7/10<br />
<br />
If we&#039;re talking about character development, I don&#039;t even know what to state. Well to be honest, I forthrightly disdain it. It&#039;s excessively constant and low-key, I wanted the two main characters   take their relationship further yet I had to dependably remind myself that this anime isn&#039;t intended for that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 8/10 <br />
Honestly, I struggle a lot composing this review because I don&#039;t even know what to write. In any case, I&#039;ve written it anyways since I had a feeling that I needed to. This series in general is endearing and gives you a sentiment of &quot;meh&quot; until the end.<br />
<br />
Overall : 8/10 <br />
I haven&#039;t had this kind of anime in a while now, kinds of relieves my stress because I&#039;ve been revising for too long. This anime doesn&#039;t deserve to be more popular, but it still also doesn&#039;t deserve to be too unpopular. Watch this anime or not, it&#039;s pretty much your own decision. If you want some low-key Yuri then I recommend you to spend some time watching this anime. <br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t had this sort of anime in a while now, kinds of relieves my stress since I&#039;ve been revising for my future exams for a really long time. This anime doesn&#039;t have the right to be progressively prevalent, and also doesn&#039;t have the right to be too unpopular. Watch this anime or not, it&#039;s pretty much your own choice. If you need some low-key Yuri in your life, at that point I prescribe you to invest some time watching this anime.

    TL:DR Review<br />
<br />
There&#039;s always one problem with this anime. &quot;What&#039;s the plot?&quot; &quot;What&#039;s the plot?&quot; However, there isn&#039;t a plot; but maybe that&#039;s a good thing. Every episode is like a short story with some kind of conflict that is solved in the 14 mins each episode. Manaria Friends only focuses on Anne and Grea, so I really wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;friends&quot; This anime, however, does not get enough credit for its animation. The shadow detail in the first and later episodes fascinated me. One other problem this anime has is, I already noted this, that each episode is 14 mins long. That&#039;s almost half a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306609">
        normal episode and on top of that, there are only 10 episodes. That being said, I believe that if the anime was longer, there would have to be a certain plot to follow so that the watchers wouldn&#039;t be bored out of their mind.<br />

    There’s something fascinating about the way fantasy anime has trended away from grand epics and adventure narratives in the past few years, instead favoring slice-of-life stories that use their fantastical elements as mere window dressing to a paired-down human story at their center. Sure, most isekai will still have enough Tolkien-inspired monster fighting to keep the sakuga nuts appeased, but the actual meat of their stories will still be focused on its characters just living their lives in this unusual, enchanting world. And even the small handful of high-profile fantasy adventure shows that have come out recently (Made in Abyss comes to mind) are still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306112">
        heavily tonal in nature, relying on atmosphere and tone-setting just as heavily as plot progression. Perhaps we’ve all gotten burned out on great epics after FMA Brotherhood successfully instilled the image of the definitive fantasy adventure in our collective consciousness, perhaps the increasingly cash-strapped industry is budgeting its resources, but either way, between your average seasonal isekai and The Ancient Magus bride, low-key fantasy seems to be the same of the game for the time being. And that’s not inherently a bad thing; there’s plenty of value in stories that aim for comfort over challenge, and who wouldn’t want to experience what it feels like to live in the magical lands that capture their imaginations?<br />
<br />
That said, if there’s one thing that Mysteria Friends has confirmed for me, it’s that sometimes, I really miss anime’s ability to go all-out with fantasy. Because while it’s by no means a bad show, it’s a show that I was constantly wishing was able to be so much more than its status as a 10-episode, 15-minute-per-episode short series allowed it. It’s a small, cramped window into a world that I want to get lost in as completely as I get lost in the sprawling fields of Amestris, or the lush landscapes of your average Ghibli fantasy. Structurally, it feels like a spin-off of an already existing property, set in the same universe as a sprawling cast of lovable characters from an entirely different show and just focusing on a couple of fan favorites who were popular enough to warrant their own offshoot property. And whereas this hypothetical parent show would likely be a magical high school Harry Potter romp along the lines of Blue Exorcist, with danger and camaraderie and secrets aplenty to keep the excitement high, this offshoot is a series of loose vignettes, checking in on a pair of students’ blossoming relationship throughout their daily lives at Mysteria Academy. In doing a little research, I found that this was exactly the case: Mysteria Friends is an adaptation of a spinoff of the Rage of Bahamut fantasy series, which I have no experience with and only vaguely know as a surprisingly well-respected card game adaptation. Evidently, I’m going to have to check that series outa t some point, because the possibilities this spin-off only hints at are so tantalizing they almost hurt to think about.<br />
<br />
Set in an academy for young wizards and witches in Medeival Fantasy World #3,456,738, Mysteria Friends plops you right in the middle of the action and starts the ball rolling as if it expects you to already know what it’s on about, befitting a spin-off of a property it likely expects its audience to be relatively familiar with. Luckily, that was no barrier to a Rage of Bahamut noob like me, as the world of this show is self-contained enough not to need any outside info to properly contextualize. Like I mentioned above, it takes the form of a series of vignettes following the daily lives of students Anne and Grea, a princess and a dragonborn, high-spirited and shy respectively. On a broader sense, that’s all there really is to this show: snapshots of a much bigger life in a much bigger world, just the faintest taste of what it must be like for these two girls to go to magic school together. The closest comparison point I can think of is Ancient Magus Bride; it has the same sense of languid, lived-in pacing, albeit splitting the difference between not being as consistently original as Magus Bride while not being as painfully slow either. There’s no greater meaning, there’s no higher purpose, and there’s nothing much to chew on if you’re not fond of either well-made yuri fluff or well-made fantasy backdrops. Thankfully, I happen to be incredibly fond of both of those things, and as simple and paired-down as Mysteria Friends is, there was something so wonderfully absorbing about it that just kept pulling me back short episode after short episode.<br />
<br />
Really, what it comes down to is the strength of its execution; Mysteria Friends only has a couple balls in the air, but it delivers on those balls incredibly well. The fantasy world we catch in the margins of this relationship is eminently fascinating, the kind of mystery you just want to dig into and unravel for yourself. There’s a part in episode 2 where Anne goes into the forbidden section of the library to find a particular book, and instead of just being a chained-off section of bookshelves, it’s an entire extradimensional space that she has to traverse one challenging environment at a time. And that’s all just happening in the background, as a montage of moments that flash by that offer mere glimpses of the wonders she’s going through. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to jump through the screen, slow the show down, and spend every second walking through this planar marvel along Anne’s side, just to experience it for myself. That sensation permeates the entire show, aided by consistently fluid and pleasing animation and a comforting piano soundtrack. Meanwhile, Anne and Grea’s relationship is so warm and comforting that it doesn’t matter how meaningless the rest of the supporting cast is; these two alone are enough to carry the show. Their relationship isn’t a journey or a challenge; it just is, in the way only people completely at home with each other can truly be. They ain’t at Hibiki and Miku’s level, but they have that same comforting afterglow that makes all my worries seem to wash away whenever they’re around. Sometimes, things just have to be to be special.<br />
<br />
And that’s my opinion of Mysteria Friends as a whole. It simply is, existing to be taken on its own merits or not. It has no pretensions or illusions, merely existing as a window into another world, a world where life goes on just as simply and straightforwardly as it does in our world, just with a little more magic and a few more lesbians. And on those terms, I’m happy for the time I spent looking through that window, even if I’m definitely hungry for the chance to squeeze my body through that gap completely and explore this universe of possibility from the inside.

    A very cute series that is a nice slice of life anime to watch on a slow day. I wish there were more episodes but you can tell from the beginning that this show wasn&#039;t meant to last. It lacked substance but it was filled with interesting characters. This show is simply about the friendship between two princesses. There is not much to this show but it&#039;s a little cute ride. <br />
<br />
The music was nice but forgettable. The piano playing was nice as was the singing from the student council president. So the voice acting is on point and truly enjoyable.

    Manaria Friends, also called &quot;Mysteria Friends&quot; can be described as the perfect illustration of a &quot;fantasy highschool slice of life with soft romance genre&quot;.<br />
<br />
Indeed, it features an extremely calm, peaceful and magical world where humans, elf, semi-humans and other ferric creatures. They are all students living in the Mysteria Academy which teaches them how to use properly their powers and classical subjects we could study ourselves (such as literature, history, biology, etc). The anime will focus on Anne, a human princess and Grea, a wonderful and attractive semi-human semi-dragon. Talking about dragons, I&#039;m currently listening (for a few days actually) to Skyrim&#039;s Theme... is that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304324">
        a sign ?<br />
<br />
Well, we will follow during 10 episodes, 10 of their student days. It fits the slice of life genre by its simple but magical scenes, going from a lecture to a city trip between girls. The man characters are catching and attractive, especially Grea who has a certain originality of being a semi-human/dragon. That includes her having a tail and horns, some body parts which particularly attracts her best friend Anne, and she won&#039;t hide her desires.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think there is a global plot, each episode could be taken in any order (except for the last one which ends Manaria Friends) and features a different scene. Actually, every episode is extremely different : for example, one focuses on a beach trip when the previous one focused on combat training. Basically, we get to follow how we would study if magic existed in the world. <br />
<br />
How I felt watching this anime can be summed up with a few words : peaceful, relaxed, calm,... This is what it brings, a very chilling atmosphere without any sort of violence or darkness, just the crossed story of 2 young teenagers living in a fantasy world. They will also discover love &amp; disappointment in their lives, though their friendship won&#039;t break ! Testifies the latest episode which represents also a school break. Indeed, both friends agree to spend more time together, sharing a room for the next semester. Ah god, the very awaited moment where our favorite dragon girl would spend a night (she accepted Anne to sleepover in her place) with her best friend... won&#039;t actually happen. Well, we know it WILL, but we won&#039;t get to SEE it. Meh, I was waiting for this scene which would have been very funny and lovely to watch : guess it will but in my own imagination.<br />
<br />
I still decide give it a 6/10 mark, &#039;cause every episode had a shorter than usual duration (+/- 14 minutes, including credits with artwork backgrounds and classic credits with a back screen), a total absence of ending or opening and also a lack of plot. It was a choice to bet on a very beautiful art and a magnificient atmosphere (I can&#039;t avoid mentioning the songs used were really accurated and gave each episode such a calm and fantastic vibe) but it - in my opinion - lacked on a more solid story.

    Manaria Friends, Mysteria Friends, Shingeki no Bahamut whatever is finally out after having been stuck in production hell for years in a will it, won’t it type situation. The big question though, was it worth the wait?<br />
<br />
Originally I thought this was going to be a full length standard anime series. You know the 12 episode 24 minute format. Instead the show was downgraded to 10 episodes at about 15 minutes a piece which is disappointing especially from a story perspective. Then again the Shingeki no Bahamut universe was known more so for having cool and fun characters rather than a cohesive story. Manaria Friends stays

        true to its world by continuing this trend. As a slice of life type show there really isn’t a story. Most of it is just daily school life in a fantasy world centered around the shows main characters in a will they won’t they get together scenario. Did I mention that these two characters happen to be female, and not just female but one is half dragon. That’s right this isn’t your normal fantasy slice of life this is a shoujo ai bordering on yuri with a thicc dragon who pines for the princess. Unfortunately they never tread past the point of no return and instead we are left feeling unsatisfied. The first episode showed promise of interspecies love yet mellows out the rest of the way. No wonder why they made the show so short. There is barely enough passable material for 5 episodes. The art and animation is pleasant to look at which is surprising for a show like this. Sound is pretty unremarkable with nothing that stands out. Overall, the show relies heavily on the promise of yuri with thicc dragon girls but ends up bamboozling the audience with a potential spicy forbidden love story that goes nowhere.

    I think this anime had a lot going for it, but imo it turned out to be lackluster at best.<br />
<br />
The plot is almost entirely missing. It seems the entire show is just about two girls doing random things with each other and sometimes there&#039;s conflict. The fight scenes aren&#039;t that bad but they&#039;re not very good either. I&#039;d say they&#039;re more there for the sake of giving the girls something else to do together, rather than being truly engaging and filled with a sense of angst and potential danger. Now, there are a lot of cute moments between the girls, but even that is superseded

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309909">
        by the fact that their relationship never develops properly, which brings me to my next point.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the relationship between the two characters is always kept in the dark. I believe this was one of the best things the show had going for it, but the delivery was awful. Their relationship between each other basically ends the same as it began; in some weird state between good friends and romantic interest. There are plenty of moments where you think &quot;Oh wow, they&#039;re such good friends&quot;, and there are plenty of moments where you think &quot;Okay, so they&#039;re into each other, right?&quot; but in the end you&#039;re always left wondering. It never develops to a satisfying conclusion (or even develops at all). It&#039;s basically just a huge tease with no real action besides a hand touch here and there.<br />
<br />
That being said, as I mentioned I do think there are some good things about this show. I very much enjoyed the art style, though I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the best. The music in the anime is very nice and relaxing and I quite enjoyed that. There were a lot of really cute moments between the main characters, and a few emotionally impactful ones, though there isn&#039;t too much in the emotional department. I think if they put more emphasis on the development of the relationship between the girls and added more direct yuri, it would have been much more successful as the characters are great and have a lot of good qualities, they&#039;re just never really explored and neither is their relationship. Its really unfortunate. They should have taken this and run with it but it&#039;s more like they army crawled backwards through the mud.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d say give it a try, but don&#039;t expect much. What you see in the first few episodes what you&#039;ll get in the rest of the anime.
