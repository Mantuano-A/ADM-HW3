    Being the lesser known of Fall 2017, Code: Realize (CR) has been one of the underdogs of this season. One of the main reason is the decreased of otome game fans in this last few years. Being left fall behind with a low mean score also reflects MAL&#039;s demography. Realize probably won&#039;t become popular, no. &quot;It won&#039;t be popular enough.&quot; in MAL. (since male viewers avoid large cast of bishies), and the fact that it has been adapted from otome game also join the cause.  <br />
<br />
As I see the poster, I thought Realize will be another of one of those reverse harem with cute

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263526">
        bishies and a little 19th-century vibe to it. But after the first half, I realize Realize:<br />
<br />
&quot;This show is underrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we imagine it, Realize can be depicted as a new recipe to make a fresh topping for pizza. Bringing a fresh idea makes this anime unique. <br />
The story is about Cardia Beckford, a girl with a deadly poison in her body, everything she touches can be melted, and thus she lives alone sheltered until she met a man named Arsene Lupin, a thief who brings her to London.<br />
  <br />
&quot;Classical but fresh.&quot; also another phrase for Realize, it can be done well. The only big matter of this kind of anime is how to make a proper adaptation from this 30+ hour of gameplay. Realize pacing can be much better if it planned to be a two-cour so it can justice that hours of gameplay. Realize story revolves fast, but not in the condition where we confused to understand its story (like Occultic; Nine for example). But despite the lack of pacing, the anime drives its plot in the right direction. <br />
<br />
The animation has been handled by M.S.C. studio (which is a quite less-known studio who works only for Tennis no Oujisama). One thing I adore is the character design, they&#039;ve been done beautifully (especially for Cardia and Hellsing), the animation is not as fluid nor perfect as modern anime these days, but it manages to meet its standard. <br />
<br />
In case of sound settings, voice actors did a very well job to bring every character alive. Background sound was decent, not a top-notch. While the opening (kalmia by Mia Regina) &amp; ending (twinkle by Saori Hayami itself) really matching with the story atmosphere.<br />
<br />
In terms of character, Cardia Beckford really shines as a heroine. Why? It&#039;s because she can break the sacred rules of a useless heroine. She can come in handy for the rest of the team instead always acting like &#039;damsel in distress&#039;. While the rest of the bishies are cookie-cutter, they are somehow related to Cardia&#039;s past and some of them have their own past as well.    <br />
<br />
In the end Code: Realize has proven its worth until this episode. Last but not least, I would say that this show isn&#039;t for everyone. But I would comfortable to say to the readers (especially Josei and Otome Game fans) that:<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#039;t trust the mean score, trust your own feelings and give it a go.&quot;<br />

    Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Code Realize and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis.   <br />
<br />
Intro and premise <br />
<br />
One girls journey to find the truth of her existence <br />
<br />
Based off a well-known visual novel of the same name Code Realize Guardian of Rebirth is a romance, adventure anime that is set in Victorian London that is in the midst of an industrial revolution that has brought the country great prosperity as a result of the invention of a mysterious but powerful resource that allowed

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266087">
        the creation of technological breakthroughs like airships. But even in this era of prosperity, it can be seen that not all is well as beneath the shadows dark forces are at work hoping to engineer change within the world situation and twist it to their own ends. <br />
<br />
The overall story follows the life of Cardia a mysterious girl that resided in a mansion on the outskirts of the capital that was widely labelled as a monster after she is rescued by a band of enigmatic thieves that is determined to keep her safe and use her as a means to locate her father and stop a plan that had been in the making for years. Joining Cardia in her quest to discover the truth of her identity is a band of unique characters that include Arsene Lupin the self-proclaimed gentlemen thief, Barbican Impey a self-proclaimed genius but a gifted mechanic, Abraham Van Helsing a former soldier hell bent on redemption, Victor Frankenstein a former alchemist determined to avenge the pain his inventions have caused and Saint Germain an enigmatic count that seems to have a mysterious reason to provide support to the group. As Cardia and her friends fight to find the truth of her origins they soon find themselves caught in a terrifying plot by a mysterious organisation that seeks to change the whole order of the world a plot that is intertwined with Cardia’s mysterious origins.  <br />
<br />
Barbicane Impey <br />
<br />
Impey Barbicane voiced by veteran voice actor Shoutarou Morikubo of Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the team’s chief mechanic. A confident, positive and carefree person Impey acts as the chief mechanic of the team capable of fixing a variety of vehicles that range from an automobile to an airship. A kind-hearted and loyal person by nature Impey while a self-proclaimed genius is actually someone that is able to back up such claims as his skills allow the cast to use many different modes of transport as the series progresses. While Impey may look like someone that doesn’t like to take things seriously it can be seen that this is not actually the case as Impey takes everything that he does with great care and when sufficiently motivated can be relied upon to work hard and provide the support the rest of the cast needs.  <br />
<br />
Cardia <br />
<br />
Cardia voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada Kun and the Seven witches fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A young teenage girl that at the start of the series was labelled by others as a monster and was imprisoned in a mansion that sat at the edge of the capital before being rescued. In the beginning of the series, Cardia as a result of having little to no contact with humans was someone that was at first unsure on how to deal with humans and as a result was also wary and guarded around people. In the beginning, Cardia was an innocent, calm and kind person that as a result of her virus kept a distance from the other members of the gang even as they tried to get to know her. Despite that Cardia at this time was well mannered and polite to everyone that she met. In the beginning of the series as a result of not having any memories as well as her isolation from the rest of the world Cardia was someone that knew nothing about what a human is and how they should normally act in the world and as a result knew very little about them and of the world as well. she also wrestled with the thought that as a result of the virus that is housed inside her that she is lethal to anyone that approaches her bringing them misfortune. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as Cardia got to see the world that lay outside of her mansion and got to know the members of the gang on an emotional level her personality starts to gradually change. While Cardia, in the beginning, was a withdrawn, indecisive and fragile young woman this starts to gradually change as the series goes on. As Cardia got to know more about the world and saw how determined the rest of the team is in wanting to protect her Cardia’s personality starts to gradually open up becoming more positive, cheerful and friendly and willing to speak to others and try to understand the problems that they are burdened with arguably becoming more human as she does. While still conscious of the curse that lays within her Cardia gradually starts to realise that letting her curse restrain her was merely limiting her life and destiny shackling them to Twilights plans. As a result of this Cardia gradually starts becoming braver, more determined and more willing to take the initiative as she tries to find a purpose and a role for her in the world that only she can control.  The character of Cardia I felt was an interesting and well-designed one and her gradual change from a young quiet and easily rattled girl to one that had resolved to take control of her own life and destiny and in the process becoming more human I felt was well done. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did a fantastic job in voicing her. <br />
<br />
Victor <br />
<br />
Victor Frankenstein played by veteran voice actor Tetsuya Kakihara of Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang. A calm, quiet and honest young man Victor though intelligent and logical is also someone that seems to be more at home in a lab creating some new mysterious element that can be used to better humanity than being part of the gang. While Victor is a quiet person by nature it can be seen that Victor is not someone that is scared or awkward around people and indeed can actually be a pretty good negotiator in the most unusual of times. As the series goes on it can be seen that Victor is someone that views science and technology as a means to advance humanity and as a result fiercely opposes its use in military matters which caused him to resign from his previous position within the kingdom and come to help the team. As the series goes on it becomes clear that Victor’s reason for helping the team in their fight against Twilight and their role in guarding Cardia was a more personal one as it can be seen that he felt immense guilt at creating the poison that caused Cardia to experience immense emotional and psychological pain and seeks to atone for his mistake by helping her get her life back.  <br />
<br />
Arsene <br />
<br />
Arsene Lupin voiced by veteran voice actor Tomoaki Maeno of Kiznaiver and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of the thieves group that protects Cardia. A kind, calm and logical person by nature Arsene emphasises the ideal image of a gentleman thief not just because of his combat outfit but also because of his mannerisms and how much he prides himself on being to steal anything without killing.  On the surface, Lupin is someone that is intelligent, perceptive and is someone that takes his role as a thief rather seriously.  Beneath this, however, it can be seen that Arsene is someone that despite being a thief is someone that believes firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and is also someone that can be surprisingly loyal to his friends and allies as well. In line with Lupin’s belief of justice and fairness, Lupin is someone that treats everyone with respect and kindness regardless of their social standing something that was influenced by his guardian and mentor that he held in high esteem. In the beginning of the series Lupin and Cardia had a rather sudden first encounter as she was rescued and in a sense kidnapped by him to protect her. As the series goes on and as they interact and get to know each other more it can be seen that the two of them gradually bond with each other and form a strong friendship. Though Cardia at first was guarded around him as she was around everyone else it can be said that as a result of Lupin treating her like a normal girl instead of as a monster that their relationship started to improve and cause Cardia to gradually open up to the others paving the path for her to break out of her shell. <br />
<br />
The character of Lupin I felt was an interesting and well-developed character that showed that despite being a thief Lupin was still someone that believed firmly in the idea of justice and freedom and unlike many of the characters that the cast meet along the way treated everyone with respect and kindness proving that one should never judge a person by their profession alone. I felt that his voice actor Tomoaki Maeno really did a great job in voicing the character of Arsene Lupin. <br />
<br />
Saint Germaine <br />
<br />
Saint Germaine voiced by veteran voice actor Hirakawa Daisuke is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A calm, composed and collected person by nature Saint Germaine initially served as the groups mysterious supporter providing them with both their main base of operations and intelligence but not showing his face until much later. After this reveal, it can be seen that Saint Germaine despite being a member of the countries nobility displays none of the arrogance that they usually do and instead Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that cares about people and treats all with humility and respect. While a quiet person Saint Germaine is shown to be someone that is very intelligent and adept at both analysing situations and creating plans that can be used to deal with them. This aspect of having a noble that actively cares about the people of the kingdom be part of the team that’s secretly protecting it I felt was an interesting move as it symbolises the fact that the battle against Twilight is one that transcends social classes. <br />
<br />
Abraham <br />
<br />
Abraham Van Helsing voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Bungou Stray Dogs and Fate Stay Night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the thieves’ gang that protects Cardia. A veteran soldier of the crown Abraham is a calm, composed and serious person by nature that fits the ideal image of someone that had seen military service and seen the realities of what war is like. A quiet person by nature and one that doesn’t like to speak unless they have someone useful to offer in addition to being quiet Abraham is also someone that is also rather direct in the way that he deals with people and threats and is someone that dislikes cutting corners. In the beginning of the series Abraham was shown to be someone that was fiercely antisocial and because of his past experiences trusted others warily which often caused some element of mistrust within the team after he joined them. However, it can be seen that beneath this attitude of his Abraham is also using it to mask his true feelings of the matter as well. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as more of Abraham’s past and backstory is revealed it can be seen that Abraham is actually someone that hates injustice dearly and is someone that believes that everyone should be treated with fairness no matter what social standing or life form that they are. As a result of his rather tragic backstory, it can be seen that Abraham is someone that bears a great deal of burden upon himself and indeed he is someone that looks upon his title as Van Helsing the vampire hunter with something that approaches hatred instead of the pride that they feel he should feel. This tragic backstory was what ultimately caused Abraham’s personality to change from loyal member of the crown to someone that is determined to eradicate Twilight and get atonement for the part that he played in exterminating an entire race. Though this journey of atonement and revenge forms a large part of Abraham’s reason for joining Cardia and the gang it can be seen that as the series goes on that it slowly diminishes as Abraham got to know and understand both Cardia and the rest of the gang. While still determined to end the head of Twilight who gave that fateful order to him it can be seen that as a result of the interactions with Cardia and the rest that Abraham’s personality gradually changes becoming more talkative, caring and more willing to help his friends and comrades and slowly begins to break out of his shell. While still wanting to atone for the grave crimes that he had helped Twilight enact it can be seen that Abraham after meeting Drac has determined that the best path would be to live on and honor the memories of the past and do not let a repeat of what happened then happen once more. The character of Abraham Van Helsing whose namesake is that of a well-known daemon hunter I felt was a well designed and developed character that as the series went on saw a great deal of development that really fleshed him out. His backstory that ultimately caused him to change his personality and focus it around revenge and atonement and its conclusion I felt was done really well as it not only served to show us how evil Twilight was but also showed the effects that its actions had on people as well. <br />
<br />
Finis <br />
<br />
Finis voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel World and Black Bullet fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the series main villain. A malicious, rude and blunt person by nature Finis serves as the leader of the Twilight a secretive intel organisation that works from the shadows orchestrating events in the kingdom from behind the scenes. While seemingly childlike in both appearance and personality it can be seen that Finis is someone that is arrogant, haughty and looks down on people quite easily and is someone that is loyal only to himself and to no one else. Throughout the series, it’s also apparent that he is also someone that does not bow down to authority even when in the presence of the queen of the realm Queen Victoria herself. While rude, malicious and arrogant in the beginning as the series progresses it can be seen that Finis is also someone that’s sadistic, cruel and manipulative and has a rather interesting relationship with Cardia as he loves to torment her both physically and mentally. As the series goes on and his role in Cardia’s mysterious origins is revealed it can be seen that Finis only see’s Cardia as something akin to a tool to their plans and as such doesn’t see her as a human being something that Cardia is extremely sensitive to. Despite only being loyal to himself it can be seen that by the latter half of the series that Finis is also pretty loyal to the idea that his father has created and indeed is someone that is willing to sacrifice everything that he has in order to bring that plan into fruition even if it meant bringing destruction to the kingdom that he was supposed to be serving. The character of Finis I felt was an interesting one as his manipulative and cunning personality along with his seemingly strange obsession with Cardia made him a character that was both challenging to deal with in both combat and in determining and foiling his many plans. <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
The animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially the portrayal of Victorian-era London that was in the throes of the industrial age. The character designs for each of the main characters I felt was also well done as it highlighted the roles that each of them played within the team pretty well. The combat scenes of which there were many within the series I felt were well designed and developed particularly the ones that showed multiple members of the gang engage enemies in combat. The designs of Twilights main henchman who wore bird shaped masks and looked like medieval doctors I felt was an interesting choice given that the role of Twilight in the story was to destroy rather than heal. In terms of music the opening and ending themes for the series which was Kalmia which was sung by Mia Regina and Twinkle which was sung by Cardia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami I felt were both very good and contrasted greatly with the feelings that they invoke with the former invoking mystique while the latter of calmness. In terms of voice acting I felt that Saori Hayami, Junichi Suwabe and Tomoaki Maeno who portrayed the characters of Cardia, Abraham and Arsene respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters.   <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion<br />
<br />
In overall Code Realize was a series that while starting slow started to get more interesting as the series progressed and was one that I actually really enjoyed watching. The series main strong points I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting. The premise of the series itself I felt was interesting as Victorian-era London is one setting that’s not often seen in anime. In the great industrial revolution that brought great prosperity to the kingdom inserting the creation of a mythical new substance and resource that can be used to create things that range from military-grade nerve gas to airships I felt was an interesting aspect as it resonated well with the age of great breakthroughs that took place in that era. While the premise of a semi-fictional Victorian London was interesting the fact that beneath this advancement existed beings that co-existed with humans yet were feared and hated by all I felt was an aspect that matched well with the theme of human advancement as even as humanity advances in tech traditional human feelings like hatred, jealousy and superstition will continue to exist within the world and that even the most peaceful of products can also be re purposed to deal with beings that the public fears. Matching well with this premise of a great industrial revolution that is paired with a shimmering fear and distrust of beings that are considered monsters by others is the overall story of Cardia and her journey to reclaim the life and memories that she had lost and in the process of discovering what it meant to be a human being.<br />
<br />
The overall story of the series itself I felt was one of the series main strong points as not only did it allow us to see how Cardia a being that was widely considered by many to be a monster gradually evolve as she got to see the large world that lay outside of her prison but also get to see her gradually learn to take control of her own life and destiny. And in doing so gradually become more human as she learned to forge friendships and bonds with people and develop trust for everyone that she encounters in her journey to find out the truth of her existence and later to stop Twilight from enacting their plan.  While the overall story was split between discovering the truth of Cardia’s identity and stopping Twilight’s plans its important to note that the story also incorporated a number of themes that defined it foremost among them is what makes a human being one. Is it our emotions, feelings, mannerisms or physical appearances? What separates us from the monsters that the army protects us from and that society fears of. These themes and questions I felt were skilfully woven into Cardia’s backstory as well as in her development and served to only enhance her journey to develop into a human that’s willing to stand up to the stigma and prejudice that society have against her due to her origins. <br />
<br />
Overall, I felt that the series had an interesting premise that was paired with an excellent story that was populated by some well-designed characters. Cadia’s gradual development from a girl that was insecure, indecisive and fragile to one that was both strong-willed and understanding of others and was determined to live her life the way that she wants while defying her father’s plans for her I felt was one of the main highlights of the series. In overall, I would say that as a final score that Code Realize would deserve a final score of 8/10 as though the series had an excellent premise, story, characters and voice acting I felt that some characters were underdeveloped and the setting of Victorian era London while interesting to see I felt was lacking in effective world building and as a result it didn’t particularly stand out something that i thought was a waste. <br />

    Ok, so Code:Realize comes to an end, and to be honest, even from a guy&#039;s perspective, it feels very paltry compared to those who have played the original game on the PS Vita.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Set in Industrial London (the exact setting as in Princess Principal), Cardia Beckford, raised by Issac Beckford, the father who created Code:Realize and even as to go as far as using brother Finis as a starting tool and herself being the catalyst for having the Horologium acting as her heart, was labeled a monster for her ability to poison anything she touches. Enter Arsene Lupin the gentleman thief, and Cardia sets off on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266139">
        a journey with Arsene and his gang to eradicate her father&#039;s plan to save the whole of London from the (initial) attacks of Twilight (aided by Finis) and as far as confronting her father to stop his plan.<br />
<br />
As you would for any Otome fan: 1 girl, many guys, a reverse harem. But even for a romance sucker like myself, I know that Cardia would only be attached to that one person (end card spoilers) for eternity. Honestly, nothing to write off about.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
The single girl, Cardia Beckford, unassumingly is not active, but always becoming the damsel in distress, but that&#039;s the trait in otome games, so I&#039;ll pass it up there.<br />
<br />
The guys however, are a part of the problem. You know it when you have characters named after historical figures (which surprisingly enough work just like the counterparts), showcase their best talents and hopes that the girl can rock her boat towards them in each single way.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
M.S.C, the studio famous for the Prince of Tennis series, seems very underwhelming for them to undertake a project based on an otome game where they don&#039;t have any doubt of the final product of the anime and assumed it&#039;s just the game developer, idea Factory, who wanted what&#039;s contained in the game to explicate itself in the anime adaptation.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say that they quality is very bare bones in conducting itself to people watching it, even for fans of the otome game. Sure, nothing is ever constructed consistently, but somehow they are able to pull off a nice, looing visual all the way through towards the ending, and yes, this adaptation has an ending.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The OST and BGM are nothing noteworthy to say of fortunately, because it feels like its all filler and no substance...with one exception, and that being the ED &quot;Twinkle&quot; by Cardia&#039;s VA, Saori Hayami. That was the only good tune out of the entire OST and sadly nothing more is being portrayed as good, or even decent for the matter.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
It&#039;s quite obvious when otome fans on that regard tell you to stay away from the anime adaptations of games because it doesn&#039;t feel justified, and the same could be said for myself being a romance sucker. This does not come close to anything noteworthy of the season as a whole, and it&#039;s an easy skip.

    &#039;&#039;Whether you’re a man or a woman, when you truly fall in love, you want to touch the one you love. When you feel their warmth, this [heart] starts to beat.’’<br />
<br />
Code: Realize is about a young woman named Cardia who has been living in isolation in 19th century’s London because of a deadly poison that resides in her body. Because of this curse, anyone or anything she touches with her skin rots or melts. As one might expect, Cardia has been shunned by everyone throughout her life so she’s never experienced friendship or romantic intimacy. One day a witty thief, Arsene Lupin, saves her and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266621">
        decides to embark on a journey with her to unravel the mystery of this curse and to possibly find a cure. Gathering fragmented clues in every episode, both the characters and the audience start piecing them together to shed light on Cardia’s past.<br />
<br />
This sounds like a very refreshing and novel premise, right? I was really intrigued by it having not read the visual novel; loving someone and having friends but not being able to touch them sounds heartbreaking. This show had tremendous potential for greatness despite the record of unsuccessful or dull adaptations of otome games. However it’s exactly because of its potential greatness that I was let down. Being a one cour, Code:Realize unfortunately suffers the same fate as most visual novels’ adaptations do: the pacing is unsteady and in order to skim through the whole plot quickly within the strict time limit of 12 episodes, it sacrifices vital character development, depth and analysis of numerous plot points. In other words, we get no significant insight into the characters’ perspective or feelings other than some fleeting moments at the beginning or end of the episode.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere of the show is quite unique and being set in industrial London really compliments the mystery. Cardia, our female heroine, is very kind and sweet. She might seem like your typical dandere at first but her intriguing background reveals that she’s far more than that. Along with Arsene, Victor, Saint, Van and Impey she discovers the warmth of friendship, developing strong bonds, relying on others and being supported. I would have loved to be able to examine her feelings and thoughts more thoroughly, but unfortunately we only got a few (but heartwarming) glimpses at them. Lupin, our main male character, is a very witty and cool guy. He’s romantically interested in Cardia and he has vowed to help her get rid of the curse. He’s the first person to treat her with respect and affection. However his character is not explored any further than the usual caring and fun, boyfriend-material type of guy. The rest of the gang is not given enough screentime either, with the exception of Van Helsing. Lastly, the villain, Finis, is not engaging either because, despite provoking sympathy in a few scenes, he remains a quite bland and forgettable type of villain.<br />
<br />
While you want to unravel the mystery and see Cardia fulfill her wish, I’d say the most satisfying and exciting thing during my watching was not the showdowns but rather the intimate, heart-warming moments between Cardia and the rest of the group. And obviously the romance. That being said, it is still an entertaining weekly watch; it gets you interested in getting your hands on the original source, so I think it has fulfilled its purpose.

    Code Realise never quite lives up to the promise of it&#039;s setting. The art is... both bland and interesting. Incredibly awkward. The color both never lives up to the visual novel, and I&#039;m not sure if it could. Visual novels just have such a fundemental different aesthetic from anime.<br />
<br />
And that the main character&#039;s design is fairly nice. It&#039;s one of the few designs that really works. The guys just seem generic, especially in design.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t hate it. The types of aesthetics it tries for just never truly works.<br />
<br />

        Baccano! are shows that do the steampunk aesthetic better. No matter what you think of it, Vampire Knight does &#039;shoujo with a dark aesthetic&#039; a lot better. Ayashi no Ceres too.<br />

There&#039;s just nothing this show does better than anyone else, in any way. Without my joy of otome and shoujo, I don&#039;t think I would have made it through.

    I thought Black Clover would be the nothingness show of the season, but Code Rrealize won this title. I can&#039;t say it is bad, but seriously, what strenght does this anime have on the good side? Almost nothing, I would say. <br />
<br />
The characters are just the every show kind and pretty bland girl with tragic past, some guys which the most remarkable features are their names and different kinds of &quot;coolness&quot; plus some irremarkable villains.<br />
<br />
The main plot is a bit interesting, but half show in and almost nothing happened. I guess the last arc will solve this, but come on. The plot should develop since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review263632">
        the beginning and relevant things should happen. Every episode something that looks important happens, but in the end nothing changes, I cuold skip from episode 1 to 6 (maybe more, the last one I watched was 5) and the only thing I would lose is the presentation of the vampire boy, mad scientist and &quot;Herlock Sholmes&quot; (really?), but the first one is irrelevant and you can easilly guess the other two&#039;s roles.<br />
<br />
Animation and sound aren&#039;t anything remarkable.<br />
<br />
In the end, I would say this show is like &quot;neither stinks nor smells&quot;. It goes to the bad side since since any enterteinment is supposed to be good.

         The source otome for this anime was the first otome I&#039;ve ever played, and I just finished it 3 weeks ago. If my boyfriend is right about animes based on otomes, this show is not unique in that it is a hollow shell of its source material. If you are even somewhat considering watching this anime without having played the otome, I&#039;d strongly urge you not to. The source material was ridiculous, ludicrous, utterly insane - but that was what was so good about it. I loved every ridiculous storyline of the game. However, this anime series was utterly disappointing.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review264844">
        I had high hopes after watching the first 2 episodes, but it quickly proved it couldn&#039;t live up to any aspect of the game. The characters are all soulless versions of the source material, same can be said of the story. Not to mention the insane plot of the source otome was condensed in an intelligible way, and without the prior knowledge gleaned from playing the game, the story is choppy, crazy, and just seems like random anime bullshit.<br />
     If you&#039;re interested in a ridiculous but interesting story that takes place in industrial age Britain, with strong steam-punk influence, that stars almost exclusively real-world famous literary characters and unfolds in an intriguing and insane but satisfactory way, play the otome. Otherwise, I suggest not wasting time on this story.

    I played this game on my PS Vita and I must same the game is an absolute masterpiece, everything from the soundtrack, art and characters are amazing and truly wonderful. I was so excited for this anime and honestly yes it is a good anime. However I do understand the low scores. <br />
<br />
For me it is a solid 7/10. To be frank, 12 Episodes was NOT enough for Code Realize.<br />
<br />
There is too much content in the game, the backstories are better explained and the character development is much more deeper. Especially the growing bonds of love and friendship between Card and Party. <br />
<br />
The pros of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review268039">
        this anime  are (in my humble opinion) <br />
Music- although it can&#039;t compare to the game, the music is good. I found the OP to be extremely addictive and enjoyable. <br />
Character- I was so worried about how Cardia&#039;s personality would be interpreted in the anime, but she is extremely likeable. I liked her and she fulfilled my expectations of MC in the anime. She is not just a pretty face. She is kind, brave and goes through a lot of inner turmoil that you can&#039;t help but relate to at times. They really did a good job representing her and her voice to me was very fitting! <br />
Story- Although rushed, the story is entertaining.The story progresses very quickly so that contributes to wanting to continue watching, for me there was never a dull moment in the series.<br />
<br />
On the downside, as I said 12 Episodes is nowhere near enough it needed at least a MINIMUM of 25 Episodes.<br />
As a result, the character back stories suffered and so did the plot. I&#039;ll be honest if I had not played the game, I wouldn&#039;t know what was going on.(Not saying go buy the game but you might be lost without knowing the background) <br />
It was very rushed, we hardly knew much about Impey and ESPECIALLY Saint-German&#039;s backstory (which is heart-wrenching in the game) was so watered down, you don&#039;t get to really understand or feel for him. <br />
However, Abraham Van Helsing I think had the most screen time to dwell into his backstory yet still a lot was left out (i.e his feud with Aleistor) <br />
I felt sorry that we did not see more of Impey or Saint, not to mention Victor and Lupin&#039;s stories were very brief but they really did deserve a lot more attention to them.<br />
<br />
THAT ASIDE, it really is a good anime. It&#039;s not just a romance/reverse harem, there is action, comedy and a darkness to this series even though it is crunched into 12 small episodes; I would still recommend this anime. <br />
<br />
There are times you can&#039;t help but laugh, you can&#039;t help but feel for the characters (Especially Van, Drac and Cardia even Finis!) And at the end I literally cried just like I did in the game. <br />
<br />
Definitely watch it, its a fun, heart-warming anime with a little bit of everything that you can&#039;t help but like all the characters! <br />
<br />
ON A SIDE NOTE: stay tuned for the after credits of each episodes because there&#039;s a small scene that leads into the next episode. I missed these and had to go back a few times to find out what was going on. <br />
<br />
I hope they make Code Realize Future Blessings! :D

    When I first found out that there was going to be a dub, I was a little hesitant to watch it. But I was proven wrong. Both the Sub and Dub were magnificent and I enjoyed the story wholeheartedly. The story was fresh and unique, the characters were quirky and I was kept at the edge of my seat with each episode. 10 out of 10. This was one of the most underdog animes this year that deserves more praise than what it received. <br />
<br />
I loved how they created characters that followed well know stories, but with a twist. Hellsing, Fran, Lupin, even Dracula. I

        hope more people find this anime and give it a chance. I am glad that I did. <br />

Both the Sub and Dub voice actors were amazing. J. Michael Tatum is one of my favorites and I fell in love with Lupin. He did a wonderful job at voicing him and giving us the feeling that his character was feeling.

I know I shit on anime Otome game adaptations, a lot (specifically Diabolik lovers..) but sometimes it&#039;s just so hard to make an otome game adaptation *good.* It&#039;s an Otome game, after all, full of cliches and such. <br />
<br />
As for Code: Realize. Like I said in my Danganronpa review, you cannot put 30 hours of content into 12 episodes unless you want a mess.<br />
<br />
Code: Realize seriously had a lot of potential, but it really blew up in its face after a while. Let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story; 5/10<br />
The story seriously was an amazing concept! But after a few episodes, it got rushed and very boring. <br />
<br />
Art; 6/10<br />
The art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313757">
        was okay, it had lots of times when the characters would look stiff and awkward, their faces would shift in shape, and sometimes their eyes would be on their forehead.<br />
<br />
Sound; 5/10<br />
The voice acting had lots of emotion, it had it&#039;s times when it&#039;d sound really forced. <br />
<br />
Character; 4/10<br />
Like I said before, this story is very rushed, and rushed stories create boring and flat characters. literally, the only thing Cardia would complain about was that she couldn&#039;t touch anything, like, we get it, you can&#039;t touch anything. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment; 3/10<br />
In the begginning, I was rooting for Cardia. I was like &quot;omg eeeeeee&quot; when Cardia and that theif had their moments. It was exciting, but soon it just got boring. I stopped going &quot;omg eeeeee&quot; and I started going &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; by episode 5. <br />
<br />
Overall; 4/10<br />
Like I said in the beginning, I do give them props for trying to make this anime watchable, and for a certain time, it was. I&#039;m glad they tried their hardest and I&#039;m happy they enjoyed what they put out. (hopefully) But honestly, maybe when we adapt another Otome anime, let&#039;s make the girl not-so-helpless, please?<br />
If you like anime like this, please be my guest and watch this, if you don&#039;t, then don&#039;t. This anime is honestly for preteens-older teenagers.

    I must say the art is as awesome as always~<br />
I really like the concept of mixing some steam punk into the art.<br />
It was really fun seeing the characters I like from the otome game move and talk in the anime.<br />
the characters are cool and well developed, definitely good for otome game.<br />
But the story was very rushed and unclear in the anime. <br />
As for viewer like me. Who played the otome game before watching this anime, the story would still seems connected, but for the viewers who know nothing about this anime/ otome game it would very confusing. <br />
I understand that they would like to introduce

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266135">
        the character as much as possible in the anime to somehow promote the otome game too. But, by mixing the story I feel like it just twisted the plot even more. <br />
It was sad that they barely show the story for Saint-Germain. Even though he is not my favorite character, I think his story was one of the best in the otome game. I can&#039;t  even imagine how confusing his character and his background story in the anime to viewers that didn&#039;t play the game. I think he was barely introduced or explained. <br />
It was sad to see the stories getting cut and altered. Probably it was done to fit the 12 episode limit... <br />
I really recommend on playing all the route in the game first before watching the anime.

    Love is to destroy and love is to heal<br />
<br />
     story: I have a few problem with it. it not that it bad it just more of why have so many famous names in fact I&#039;m surprise they didn&#039;t include jack the ripper  but they have everybody else from sherlock homes to Dracula and famous item that are told in popular story. I think it what made it not a great how  if they just stuck with maybe 1 or 2 famous character it could be fine but yet I like the idea of of a love story where a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295250">
        girl can never touch a human nor be able to kiss one for sure it would make for a good story however the show kinda makes feel a bit drawn out and no real deep moments except for episode 7 maybe the best episode of the series where it gives it a bit of a backstory to cardia life.<br />
<br />
      character: not really much to say here for as it all generic and no real development into them for as they are merely playing there part as the famous names indented to be however I do like cardia to a point she is a nice character with a big heart though you can&#039;t help not feel for them but the story tends to drive away a lot not really focus on the character themselves. <br />
<br />
    art/sound  the artwork is nothing really special or haven&#039;t seen before so I won&#039;t go much into it however the OP I actually pretty good I like sadly it maybe the only I like about this whole series music is okay throughout but nothing memorable.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Overall: it certainly not the worse show I&#039;ve seen though it not the best it is a bit of drag trying to watch it but the ending kind of almost redeem itself but no the mess that up it made me not feel for the character nor anything about. the best thing I can say about it is that ot does put a definition of love is to destroy and yet love is to heal. if you like a story with famous names and love of pain as in the character suffering to get a happy ending you think they deserve. if your into that kind of thing you might enjoy it is all i can say about it.

    Being an otome fan myself, I&#039;ve always been a sucker for the reverse harem premise. Naturally, this anime has drawn my attention to watch it for the guys, the pretty art as well as the romance. <br />
<br />
And I realized that when I stopped thinking about the logic behind the premise of the show and simply hop along the ride, I actually had a good time watching.<br />
<br />
I personally haven&#039;t played the visual novel so I had no idea what to expect but surprisingly, I was charmed by the characters of the series. Their personality quirks and constant &quot;frienemies&quot; arguments are cliche but unexpectedly refreshing. I found

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266355">
        myself giggling here and there. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I just found myself welcoming the way Cardia is being treated by the guys in the show. It is very nice to see the guys being gentle around her. I&#039;ve seen way too many otome theme anime that have the guys treated the main girl harshly so it was a nice change of pace to see the main guy isn&#039;t a Tsundere jerk for once.<br />
<br />
The art and the animation of the show isn&#039;t exactly top-notched but it&#039;s no way un-watchable. The drawings of the characters are consistent for the most part but you would notice the obvious lazy drawing during the wide shots. The animation is just &quot;okay&quot; to carry the story. <br />
<br />
The OP and the ED definitely fits the vibe of the show but I don&#039;t personally find them memorable. Just okay.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you find yourself needing a bit of cheesy and gentle romance, help yourself to this show! Just don&#039;t expect to find anything profound about it :)<br />
<br />

    I do like these cheesy anime, this one did test me on just how cheesy something can be before I start to despise it. Would make a good drinking game, take a shot every time a character says their name or a name of someone they already know (only joking you would die), I swear 60% of the dialogue is just names of people over and over and over......  Didn&#039;t like the main character, bland, boring, most of them were to be fair, nothing interesting about them some so boring, bland and meek, had no sense of urgency about them. A few characters I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302643">
        enjoyed just not the main cast, would have loved to spend more time with the brother and the queen. I did like the art I guess the clothes and such looked really cool, right up my street. I liked the voice acting (English), my one annoyance is how some characters sounded so timid, seemed so off like they couldn&#039;t be bothered so monotoned, one guy in particular really annoyed me. I liked the overall story, thought it was unique and could have been explored more, I&#039;m excited to buy the game to experience the full story. I would say its fine to pass the time with as a romance anime. It had an ending which is a big plus for me although be it a bit convenient. 6/10

    If you like otome type of anime, you probably like this anime. But if you&#039;re a person like me who enjoy a deep plot and nice story, this isn&#039;t for you.<br />
The problem in this anime is too average. To be honest, I like Cardia in the first place. But after the episode 3, I began to feel boring. The 1st episode is quite nice but I gain less interest in the next episode. This is the weakness when the anime was an adaptation of the otome games. Their romance seems to be so forceful and the story was rushing. They need to cut all the

        harem routes and chose Lupin. If you only seek for a typical romance, this is fine for you. But this is definitely not recommended for people who want a better story.<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy this? Yes, in my half-sleep. <br />
Will I watch it again? Definitely No. <br />

    Ok , this review wont be like others dwelving into story and such.<br />
<br />
I just talk about random feelings that i had when watching this<br />
<br />
I will get right to the point.<br />
The story overall didnt make me want to watch for more.<br />
The story was unique though but not captivating.<br />
 I completed it but not like those which are so interesting to leave and you just keep on watching from one episode to next and feel like you will stop at next episode but you cant.<br />
It was hard for me to finish,<br />
This may had to something with the fact that i am not that big a fan of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272728">
        romance genre.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story progression felt slow, there were moments when it felt it is just to slow that maybe i should just speed up and finish it fast.<br />
<br />
There are not much action scenes,,thats to be expected cause its romance i think. So, obviously this one is not for those who love action, adventure, etc.<br />
<br />
As for romance genre , it felt lacking,,The story couldnt touch the heart,<br />
<br />
The character didnt leave any impression like some character does .<br />
<br />
PS: This ones just for the record . That i hate those things where they only say one name only like other character are useless and doing nothing.<br />
it probably is feeling towards each other that makes the girl sayl only lupin . I am generally not a fan of such thing. There are those people who are helping her at least she could remember them once . I just took out the anger built in me.<br />
The one in PS is personal hate , it may or most probably wouldnt apply to other people<br />

    Code:Realize is forgettable and dull reverse harem. While the heroine&#039;s existential crisis was an interesting discussion, she spent most of her time passively where she ends up in situations where she had to be rescued by her love interests. The male leads were also uninteresting, sticking too close to their archetypes instead of acting like human beings. <br />
<br />
My one nitpick is that the writing of Code:Realize was so poorly done that the characters&#039; relationships weren&#039;t fully justified. Everyone kept on saying how the heroine meant a lot to them, but the sequence of events made it hard to see what do they see in her.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365648">
        The only exception was the love interest for the anime.<br />
<br />
The artwork was beautiful, but the animation was really stiff. The OST wasn&#039;t memorable, though the English Dub was well done despite the story. Overall, Code:Realize wasn&#039;t a frustrating watch. Rather, it&#039;s another run-in-a-mill reverse harem.

    YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS ANIME.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS ALERT:<br />
I will try to keep them to the minimum without involving any actual details and explanations, but the main plot is written down. You will kinda find them in the CHARACTER and STORY parts of the review. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s so underrated, I can&#039;t believe now that I watched it. I would recommend it for art, sound, and interesting characters. <br />
<br />
ART:<br />
<br />
I love the design of the characters and the clothes they wear. <br />
The animation is pretty and nicely done through most of the anime.<br />
Dresses and suits are so pretty and detailed. <br />
The houses and the city too.<br />
Everything is designed with little gorgeous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review357534">
        details. <br />
Here and there you will see some scenes (static scenes) where the characters look like they draw them in the last 5min. <br />
Though it did happen just a few times and you can see that in every anime, especially one with so many details to character design.  <br />
That would be the only thing that I didn&#039;t like about art.<br />
The dog&#039;s leg is so pretty and I definitely did not expect to see soo much effort put in such a small detail.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
<br />
I think they did a good job with their voices and songs. They even added a lullaby. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS:<br />
<br />
All of the men show some unique, interesting personalities. <br />
For the main heroine, she is pretty and she brings their personalities to shine through the story. That&#039;s why I recommend you to watch the OVA too after the anime, it&#039;s the best.<br />
She is kinda boring character. I mean, she knows how to defend herself and she can do things herself which is great because usually, that&#039;s not the case. <br />
She is just too kind and obedient. Like she has personality, but because of the others, it&#039;s not really showing that much.<br />
I would prefer something more sarcastic and straightforward as Ani Inako from Damepri Anime Caravan.<br />
I think that kind of personality would bring much more fun and life to the story.  <br />
I do understand why she is as she is in the beginning, but later, I think they could have changed it. <br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
<br />
I tried to make the review long enough so that you can read about art and sound without any spoilers for the story or main plot.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a really unique way of representing a basic plot that you can find everywhere - the main heroine, pretty boys around her, destroying/saving the world. <br />
She is not a classic helpless idiotic heroine wich is refreshing. <br />
She actually can walk and do things by herself. Of course, she needed to be saved, etc, but it was pretty nice.<br />
I personally loved the whole anime, though I have to say that the last part was a kinda basic story in saving a heroine and saving the world plot, it was done in such a great way. <br />
The idea of a thief as a hero is really nice. It remained me of some movies with thieves and magicians. <br />
<br />

Overall I enjoyed watching this anime because of its pretty art and unique, interesting way of bringing a romance, world-saving story.<br />
I would recommend watching OVA too because I find it may be the best episode of the whole anime, but to understand it you need to watch the anime first.

    What can I say. It&#039;s your typicall reverse harem but with a twist. The main girl actually has some growth which is why its better than other reverse harems if you can even call this a reverse harem. Overall I didnt find any of the soundtrack that fascinatiing which is why I gave it such a low score. I really liked the art style that the anime had and I personally think it fit into the revolutionary vibe that the series has. Overall if you are a sucker for a reverse harem if you want to call it that this is the best one that

    If you happen to find this anime in 2021 or later, I beg of you to play the game instead. As a devoted fan of the otome game (now on switch), I was very disappointed in this adaption. I know things are undeniably going to have to be cut to make one cohesive plotline when it comes to making otome anime, but there were just so many things left out or butchered that would&#039;ve greatly helped the plot and showcase to anime-onlys the depth of the characters to let the story really shine. ~Spoiler Free~<br />
<br />
Story:  5<br />
<br />
As it is nearly the same story as the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review399034">
        game, obviously that is good and unique. Being a steampunk English romance about a girl that can&#039;t touch those she loves is obviously very compelling. However there were fights omitted I&#039;m sure due to budget, deeper world-building plot lines skimmed over for times sake, and one character&#039;s last scene was drastically changed to give a better &quot;feel good&quot; send off. There were also bigger mystery reveals just randomly dropped like it was common knowledge or placed at the beginning of an episode like it wasn&#039;t the single biggest turning point for the main character, thereby butchering a big chunk of the overall story. There was also a big moment for the pairing they chose to cover, however instead of showing it properly cut it down to just be an image for the ending. I couldn&#039;t believe they did that, it&#039;s one of the biggest moments in the whole game. Overall just messy, underwhelming, and nowhere as good as it could have been but I guess it gets the job done. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 3 <br />
<br />
Sometimes, it&#039;s pretty. Other times they look like slender man. Opening and ending obviously showed a lack of budget, again proven by the poor cgi that reveals itself later on. There was also a scene where a character falls and it&#039;s supposed to be all scary that they could be dying, but the animation is so poor it looks like they cut around their body and literally just click and dragged the drawing down the screen. I couldn&#039;t believe that was left in and accepted as is. To their credit, I did keep replaying it because I couldn&#039;t stop laughing at the sight of it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 6 <br />
<br />
No complaints with sound quality, though the song choices and OST were reallyyyy lacking, especially compared to the soundtrack of the game which is so unapologetically itself and memorable. Voice acting was great, but that was expected as they&#039;re the same seiyuus as the game. So, it was fine. <br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 2<br />
<br />
This is the part that really grinds my gears. Due to their need to try and show a little bit of each character but only having 12 episodes (+ OVA), you&#039;re just left wanting more. I feel they could&#039;ve absolutely gone more in depth especially with Van Helsing, Saint Germain, Frankenstein, and the Queen. But the worst part I think, was how Cardia&#039;s development got practically halved compared to the game. She has basically no personality here besides being nice and sad. She feels like your run of the mill otome main character when in game she is meant to just be a clean slate of a person, slowly learning to smile and figure out who she is as an individual. In game, she often has moments of strength, self-sacrificing, and humor. She even learns how to be selfish and calls Lupin a troublemaker, (something this cardboard cut out of Cardia would never do), showing their bond and understanding. But even here where they pushed aside everything else for their relationship, it feels forced and immediate with no build or clear show of their feelings or how we got from point A to point B. It all just makes no sense to me on the decisions while putting this show together because as any dating sim gamer would know, the romance is all about the characters and their slow building bonds. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment &amp; Overall: 3<br />
<br />
Of course I was able to somewhat get through this anime with sheer nostalgia of the love I have for the source material, so I can&#039;t say I absolutely hated it. But I&#039;m just disappointed because anime is really for seeing the works you love come to life before your eyes, and I was left wanting to go back to one of my saves just so I can hear the OST and read the story properly. And to be fair that&#039;s probably why this was made, to draw an even bigger crowd to buying the game. But I think it more so hurt than helped, and was a waste of everyone&#039;s time. What&#039;s the point of adapting a story if you&#039;ll only give/be able to give it low quality visuals and music as well as cut down the story that made it so special in the first place? <br />
<br />
So again, I&#039;d strongly recommend if you happen to find this show somehow and come by this review, I vehemently suggest you skip and instead go for the game. Otomes just really aren&#039;t built for half-hearted anime adaptions, as the Code: Realize anime proves once again. <br />
