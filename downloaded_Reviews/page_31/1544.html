Based off a well-known manga of the same name Konohana Kitan gives us the opportunity to see what the life and duties of a team of fox girls would be if they decided to operate a traditional hot spring inn in an setting reminiscent of ancient Japan that’s mixed with a fantasy world  The first episode of the series really did an excellent job of introducing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265708">
        me to a world where all sorts of races exist and live alongside each other and left a pretty good impression on me enough that I decided to stick with it and im glad that I did.  <br />
<br />
Taking place in a fantasy world that combines the traditional culture of ancient Japan with the fantasy world is a world that is populated by all sorts of races and creatures each of which has their own cultures and mannerisms. Here humans are but one race that exists in harmony with many other races that live in the world. The overall story follows the adventures of Yuzu a young fox girl that until now has been living with her master and guardian on the outskirts of the city and follows her exploits as she joins the staff of the Konohantei a large and popular hot spring inn that serves as the city’s main flagship hotel that has a well-earned reputation of being able to provide its guests with attentive service and solutions for problems that bother them. As Yuzu joins the inn’s staff to work as an attendant she will be joining a number of interesting characters that include the workaholic and serious-minded Satsuki, the elegant and refined Ren, the tomboyish but considerate Natsume, the quiet but helpful Sakura and the relaxed but intelligent head attendant Kiri. Working together with such a colourful cast and at such a relaxing hotel Yuzu would soon learn that providing rooms and helping with the needs of the hotel’s guests is only half of their duties and a true attendant also works to ensure that any problems that they are bothered with are dealt with and ensure that they can enjoy their time here to the fullest.   <br />
<br />
Yuzu <br />
<br />
Yuzu voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Oono is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A fox girl that had until the start of the series had lived her whole life with her master Yuzu is an innocent, eager and polite young girl that’s also positive and cheerful. In the beginning of the series Yuzu was a happy and go lucky girl that while a bit naïve made up for it by being eager to help others in their duties. Though an energetic girl she was also clumsy and in the beginning caused no small amount of trouble for her co-workers but instead of letting that affect her Yuzu did what she proves to be able to do the best which is bounce back. While dismayed at first that her master will be leaving her to work at such a strange place Yuzu as the series goes on comes to understand the reasons behind her master’s decision and comes to love working at the inn. While having no real skills in the beginning Yuzu in an effort to not bother others shows one of her more prominent traits which is that of her diligence as she works hard to both support her fellow attendants and learn how to improve her skills so as not to slow them down. This willingness to learn new skills to help her friends so as to not affect their duties is one of the traits that truly define her. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as Yuzu comes to understand the roles of an attendant more it can be seen that Yuzu starts to develop a fondness for working at the inn. This is because it allows her to not just work to improve her skills but also in allowing her to meet many new characters and situations that she can learn from and thus give her a purpose. Though surprised at first that being an attendant also involves listening to the problems that the guests are troubled with as the series goes on it can be seen that Yuzu is a very kind and caring person by nature that cares a great deal about the guests and their circumstances and she will try her utmost to understand the problems that they are burdened with. While respectful towards the guests and knowing that sometimes it can be hard for them to say what troubles them to strangers Yuzu would often go to great lengths to try and understand and figure out the problems which often results in the guests eventually letting up and tell her. While knowing the limits of her knowledge Yuzu nonetheless tries her best to offer her insights into the problems that were expressed and come up with a solution that is often a surprisingly well thought one. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting and well-designed one that had some pretty good development as the series went on. Seeing her develop from the naive, eager and clumsy young fox girl into a kind, caring and considerate young fox girl that was as adept at work as she was at listening to and understanding guest’s problems I felt was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yuuko Oono really did an impressive job at voicing the character of Yuzu. <br />
<br />
Sakura <br />
<br />
Sakura voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Brave Witches and Asterisk Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot spring inn. A quiet, innocent and carefree member of the attendant staff Sakura despite being the youngest of the inn’s staff is a veteran attendant that has been working at the inn for some time. While polite and helpful towards both guests and fellow attendants it can be seen that Sakura is someone that is slow to trust others and seems wary of outsiders that enter into the close family that is the inn’s staff of attendants. However, as the series progresses it can be seen that Sakura once she has determined that the new member was someone that was trustworthy would gradually open up her personality to them and eagerly try to bond with them. While a quiet girl Sakura has been shown to be very loyal to her fellow attendants and friends and while she doesn’t speak much she will let her actions speak for herself. As it is I felt that the character of Sakura was an interesting character that emphases on the quiet but cautious member of the inn’s attendants, but I felt that she would have been better if she had more voice lines for her seiyuu. Still, I feel that wordless interactions with the others certainly had its moments that were appreciated such as her hostile relationship with Okiku. <br />
<br />
<br />
Satsuki <br />
<br />
Satsuki voiced by new seiyuu Sawako Hata is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot springs inn. A serious-minded, dutiful and hard-working member of the inn’s attendant staff Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant staff and well versed in dealing with the types of guests that stay at the inn. While hardworking and dutiful and trusted greatly by the other members of the team in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Satsuki’s, attitude was rather aloof and quiet and seemed to be wary of working as a team with others. Moreover, her serious-minded and workaholic nature also meant that she often clashed with the more laid-back members of the team such as Kiri and Natsume. Despite this Satsuki’s experience of dealing with guests and ability to react to sudden situations is something that is valued greatly by the rest of the team and it can be seen that when she’s directing others to their duties that she imparts a sense of purpose and order to them when doing so. <br />
<br />
As the series goes on and as we see her interact more with the cast and with Yuzu, in particular, it can be seen that she is burdened with a great deal of responsibility that has the effect of driving her to do her best in her work. In the beginning of the series, Satsuki was someone that treated her work as an attendant with the utmost importance pursuing it relentlessly and never taking any time off for herself even for festivals. As a result of this Satsuki when she had time off was someone that looked somewhat lost when she had nothing to do which I felt was kinda sad considering her age. The main cause of this was her desire to show her sister that took her dream role from her that even in another role she can still do an excellent job. A direct consequence of this desire, however, is the pressure that she imparts on herself as she is afraid of making mistakes and cause troubles to others. As the series goes on and after meeting Yuzu and interacting with her Satsuki’s personality starts to gradually change. While she still remains hardworking and serious it can be seen that she’s also willing to interact more with the rest of the team on a more personal level and no longer keeps a distance from the others. In particular Satsuki gradually learns to rely on the other members of the team and place her trust in them rather than try to do everything on her own. The character of Satsuki I felt was an interesting character and one that was both well designed and saw a great deal of development as the series went on. In particular, I really liked the interaction that Satsuki actually had with Yuzu and the changes that she caused to develop in Satsuki’s personality. All in all, I felt that her seiyuu Sawako Hata really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Satsuki. <br />
<br />
Ren <br />
<br />
Ren voiced by new seiyuu Risa Kubota in her first role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s fellow attendants at the inn. An elegant, kind and understanding person Ren like Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant’s team. Outwardly Ren is a positive, hardworking and the very image of someone that’s both self-confident in her skills as an attendant as she is in her physical appearance. As a result of this self-confident nature of hers Ren is someone that has great pride in her abilities and skills as a host and in the beginning her attitude can often be seen as arrogant and haughty as she takes everything seriously. However, beneath this surface personality, it can be seen that Ren is actually a very fair person and doesn’t like to be in debt to others or let them take the blame for her mistakes. While kind and positive it can be seen that Ren also has a cynical side to her as well best seen in her first interactions with Yuzu. This side of her however gradually disappears as the series goes on as a result of her deepening friendship with her. A prominent trait of Ren that I find interesting is her ability to switch from one expression to another quite literally a trait that not even Satsuki is able to accomplish. This I feel is an indication of both Ren’s skill as an attendant as well as her personality which is adaptive of different situations. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses and more of Ren’s personality is revealed it can be seen that Ren is someone whose inner personality somewhat contrasts with her outer personality. Outwardly Ren is someone that takes great pride in her physical appearance and believes that it’s the duty of all girls to look pretty and presentable to others. However, within her inner personality it can be seen that this holds a far greater meaning within her as inwardly Ren believes that if she wasn’t dressed up she wouldn’t be able to display the confident and efficient self that she shows to others meaning that in a way it’s her pride and dressing up nicely that actually makes her the person that she is to others. An interesting aspect of Ren is her close relationship with her fellow attendant and childhood friend Natsume. Although they are co-workers and have been working together enough in that they know each other’s habits as well as weaknesses it can be seen that their relationship goes beyond that of simple friends as Ren seems to be extremely conscious of her performance and mannerisms when in front of her. The interactions between these two I felt though were actually really cute especially when Ren is remarked by Natsume to be cute as Ren is someone that wants to be seen as classy and efficient rather than being cute. Overall, I felt that the character of Ren was a well designed and developed one that while haughty and proud on the outside is also unexpectedly nice and forgiving in the inside a contrast that I felt suits her nicely. For her first performance as a seiyuu, I felt that Risa Kubota really did an excellent job in her portrayal of Ren.  <br />
<br />
Kiri <br />
<br />
Kiri voiced by veteran seiyuu Manami Namakura of Aoki Hagane no arpeggio and Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s fellow attendants at the inn. A calm, composed and elegant fox girl Kiri serves as the inn’s head attendant and as a result is the commander of the team of attendants that work at the inn. While Kiri can appear to be a rather laid-back person it can be seen however that Kiri is a perceptive and understanding person that as a result of her extensive experience is someone that’s kind and understanding and able to offer a great deal of advice and opinions to her subordinates and guests and as a result is well respected by both. Though the duties of a head attendant are a busy one it can be seen that Kiri is someone that trusts each of the girls massively and is willing to let them try and solve problems that guests may be burdened with but at the same time willing to protect them if things turn out sideways. While Kiri’s assignment of attendants may appear random at times it can be seen that this choice is actually based on her analysis and understanding of each of the skills of her team as well as their personalities and thus allowing her to deal with any flare-ups that happen quite easily. While Kiri’s personality may appear to be teasing at times it can be seen that she’s always ready to help and motivate people if they seem to be stuck at an impasse showing her helpful nature. The character of Kiri I felt was an interesting character in that while she appears to be a laid-back person that lets her subordinates handle the bulk of the work the fact that beneath that image of her is actually someone that is perceptive, kind and understanding of both guests and her subordinates and is actually someone that cares a great deal about her charges and willing to protect them was a nice surprise. Her observations on the guest’s problems as well as her tendency to let her charges think of a way to solve them so as to allow them to learn I thought was admirable and something that all bosses should aspire to be. I felt that her seiyuu Manami Namakura really did an excellent job at voicing her. <br />
<br />
Natsume <br />
<br />
Natsume voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Suwa of Asterisk Wars and Phantasy Star Online 2 fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s fellow attendants at the inn. A positive, helpful and mischievous fox girl that like Ren and Satsuki are veteran members of the attendant staff. On the surface, Natsume is a positive and cheerful person that loves to pull jokes on people and help set the mood in situations that turn out to be grim.  However, beneath this side of her it can be seen that Natsume is also someone that is diligent and skilled at her duties and cares a great deal about the welfare of the guests as well as her fellow attendants and would work hard to protect her fellow attendants and friends from harm. While Natsume’s default personality may appear to be a careless one it can be seen that she too has a serious side to her personality as when she becomes serious she can be surprisingly perceptive and understanding of the reasons that people may be down for. In this side, she’s shown to be surprisingly loyal and protective of her friends as well. <br />
<br />
On the surface, while Natsume is often paired with Ren in their duties as attendants of the inn it can be seen that their relationship is far closer than that of normal friends and co-workers. As the series goes on and their past gets revealed it can be seen that the two were in fact childhood friends that had bonded with each other due to a rather unusual circumstance in Ren’s past. As a result, it can be seen that Natsume views Ren as someone that is very important to her and treasures the relationship that they have between them strongly enough in that she will be there to protect her when she needs it.  This relationship between the two forged over a simple promise to prevent Ren from going into despair I felt was interesting as it allowed us to see the depths of the bond that exists between the two characters. The Character of Natsume I felt was a well designed and developed one whose role in the series while focusing on comic relief and bringing fun to serious situations also served as the glue that bound the cast together. I felt that her seiyuu Ayaka Suwa really did an excellent job at voicing the character of Natsume.  <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
Animation wise I felt that the inn and the town areas that the cast visit in the series was very well designed and did an excellent job of combing the scenery of ancient Japan and the new shared culture that exists in this world. The design for each of the races that were featured in the series I felt was also pretty good and varied enough to ensure that each being will be interesting as you see them. The individual character designs for each of the main cast I felt was well designed and matched well with each of their personalities.  The music for the series I felt was one of the strong points of the series as it helped convey the overall mood of not just the series but also of the individual episodes and their stories as well. In particular, I really liked the opening and ending themes that the series made use of as it was not only catchy but also calming and cute as well with the latter being applied best to the ending theme. The voice acting for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points as I felt that each member of the cast was able to do an excellent job in portraying their characters. In particular, I felt that Yuuko Oono, Sawako Hata and Risa Kubota who portrayed the characters of Yuzu, Satsuki and Ren respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that despite being new seiyuu’s they still did a fantastic job in portraying their assigned characters. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story that conveyed a lot of interesting life lessons, an interesting and well-developed cast of characters and excellent voice acting and music. The premise for the series itself is a basic one that is often seen in slice of life animes that Konohana Kitan belongs to but this simple premise I felt was what enabled the premise to be one of its greatest strengths of the series. Hot spring inns are one of the staples of the Japanese tourism industry and choosing to form a story around the work of the attendants at the inn as they work to not just manage the inn but also take care of the guests that stay at the inn and make use of the services was an interesting idea. The overall story that makes use of this interesting premise I felt was a strong one as not only did it show the casts development as they worked alongside and bonded with each other but also show how they worked to understand and solve the problems that bother the guests. This theme of not just taking care of the guests physically but also working to solve the problems that are bothering the guests mentally I felt was interesting and resonated well with the premise of attendants taking care of their guests. Each of the problems that were featured as part of the story I felt was well done and thought out that really imparted a number of interesting life lessons both to Yuzu and the cast and to us as the viewers. The fact that these problems incorporated a great deal of themes that were paired with each of the unique circumstances of the guests themselves I felt was an excellent move. <br />
<br />
In overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed as it had an interesting premise and story that featured plenty of well thought out and developed sub-stories that served to make each of the guests that the cast welcomed a unique existence. Of these the cursed doll Okiku, the spirit of the daughter and the weaver were one of my favourites. The character development for the series as well as the development of the gradual bond of friendship that forms between the cast as they encounter, solve and learn from each of these problems was something I particularly liked as well. As a final score, I would say that Konohana Kitan would deserve a final score of 10/10.   <br />

    A beautiful village of spirits. A joyful weather. And a mysterious feeling of tranquility. It’s not every day you get to see a group of mythical girls hanging out together and enjoying life. Konohana Kitan is a show that’s simple as it gets – cute girls doing cute things with a touch of fantasy. This anime is a heartwarming show that knows how to put all the ingredients to craft a charming slice of life. For me, Konohana Kitan is a gem that really shined without complexity.<br />
<br />
Bringing together a cast of characters into this show feels like the creator needed to inject personality. I mean,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265703">
        lots and lots of personality. The initial first episodes portrays the innocent fox Yuzu as she arrives at Konohanaeti. The first impressions she brings in is questionable as Yuzu really demonstrates what it means to be a klutz. She is clumsy, inexperienced, and doesn’t know her place well. However, Yuzu is a very friendly girl that can get along with everyone and through her personality, she improves and has an innate charm that other characters begin to appreciate. It didn’t take me long to accept Yuzu as a likable character because the way she bonds with others.<br />
<br />
Indeed, relationship dynamics is an important part of this show and it really knows how to sell those points. Yuzu’s relationship with Satsuki is one of those relationships that really tests herself. In the beginning, their relationship starts rocky because let’s face it, their characters really are almost like foils of each other. Yuzu is friendly and respectful while Satsuki has a much more serious personality. Not to mention, Satsuki is a very hardworking character and doesn’t tolerate mistakes often. One might describe her as a workaholic although it’s clear that she cares about her friends/co-workers. Throughout the show, she begins to warm up to Yuzu and it’s obvious that she cares about her. Yuzu’s personality also has influence on her as Satsuki begins to enjoy the love of working, rather than just work towards her dream.<br />
<br />
Beyond Satsuki, Yuzu also brings the best out of other characters too through character relationships. Yuzu is able to impress Natsume and the both of them strives to work harder to make Konohanaeti into a better place. She and Sakura also shares a peculiar relationship because of their size although the both of them really begin to respect each other as time goes on. On the other hand, there’s Natsume and Ren, two characters that’s more like a ship-tease pair compared to the other cast. Through their interactions, it’s obvious that Ren harbors a crush on Natsume even though the show doesn’t fully explore it. Although this show isn’t a yuri that capitalizes on female romance, it can easily get fans to fantasize on this pair. That being said, the core characters in this show contains a lot of personality. Whether it’s Yuzu’s friendly attitude, Natsume’s tomboyish tendencies, Satsuki’s rigidness, or Ren’s strive to be perfect, the show can easily get you into the mood just with its colorful characters<br />
<br />
Despite the story being simple, it has a mysterious aura that almost feels like a bit of suspense. What exactly is Konohanaeti? Why do some characters come there? What is its true purpose? Where this is even located? Throughout the show, it has a certain mystique that I can’t help but wonder. While almost every episode is an adventurous sitcom, there’s definitely more than meets the eye about the world setting. Plus, we do get hear stories about the past that influences the future from certain characters. There’s also one particular episode that really capitalizes the opportunity for world building. It’s one of those episodes that draws the line between fiction and reality. Additionally, this anime is great at evoking certain emotions. These can bring a smile to the viewers’ face or more poignant moments for emotional storytelling. The comedy is also sold well on most parts through the relationship teasing and even occasional fan service. <br />
<br />
Adapted by studio Lerche, Konohana Kitan is a colorful show and I mean that as one that transcends its setting than beyond just an inn for characters to visit. The places has a youthful theme and brings in all types of characters including ones with relations to mythology. The animalistic characteristics of the cast is also noticeable such as Yuzu’s ears and Satsuki’s tail. There’s even a doll girl introduced in this anime to add a bit of innocent feel. Fan service exists and it’s often portrayed as a way of character teasing that’s hard to ignore. The theme songs are melancholic with a colorful vibe and decorated with creativity. <br />
<br />
That being said, I also feel like the character cast does a great job at portraying their characters. I mentioned before that the show has a lot of personalities. To bring that to life, it requires skill of the VA and thankfully, they pull it off in a masterful fashion. Yuzu’s innocence is portrayed convincingly thanks to the talent of newcomer Yuuko Oono. Sawako Hata’ talent is also worth mentioning for bring a character like Satsuki to life. It’s not easy to adapt a character with a serious voice but she pulls it off with flying colors through her words. Kiri, perhaps the most mature character of the cast is also well adapted thanks to the modern talent of Manami Numakura. Throughout the show, every episode also maintains a balanced OST with touches of melancholy. <br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan is an underrated show that proves slice of life doesn’t always need to rely on a modern setting. It doesn’t have to involve characters living the school life. Instead, this anime stands out on its own with its credible genres. The way every character is adapted really brings the best out of each other. It has a story that is simple enough to get viewers invested into its idea. I can honestly recommend this show to just about anyone. To put it simply, Konohana Kitan is an enchanting show that’s a love letter to slice of life.<br />

    Most moe shows create adorable characters for fans to love, but typically they stop there without taking their stories further. <br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan isn’t one of those shows, and it would be woefully underselling it to say that it&#039;s just cute. Beyond its adorable cast of fox eared ladies and it’s initial “cute girls run an inn” hook there are deeply human themes woven in.<br />
I don’t usually advocate for moe shows, however, I think Konohana Kitan hasn’t gotten a fair shake from most people based on its aesthetic choice, so I want to get my opinion down to hopefully steer some people to this wonderful show.<br />
<br />
Story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261715">
        8/10<br />
At the start of the show, the clumsy main character Yuzu gets her first job at Konohanatei; a hot spring inn in a village home to a variety of spirits and anthropomorphized animals. Konohanatei gives off a meditative atmosphere drawing in a variety of wise guests who impart life lessons onto the main cast, which includes six of the hot springs employees. Each episode follows the adorable employees through their daily lives working and living at Konohanatei, their personalities bounce off each other making plenty of funny moments that contrast with some really poignant moments that evoke very real-world themes. The first episode shocked me at how the story wasn&#039;t just meant to be generic, it has a purpose and so far it has achieved it. <br />
The story may just be a mode for delivering themes and crafting memorable character moments, but it&#039;s a slice of life so the predictability didn&#039;t bother me.<br />
<br />
Characters 8.5/10<br />
The six leads are paired together in classic shoujo-ai fashion. In the first four episodes, the story has followed Yuzu, Satsuki, and Ren. The three of them have layered personalities that go beyond how they seem upon a first look, their backstories are interesting and are visible in their characterizations. <br />
The two leads that have gotten the most development so far are Yuzu and Satsuki. They have a lot of chemistry together which makes the scenes that they&#039;re together very enjoyable.  <br />
When they&#039;re together on screen their simple but opposing personalities clash to make for some funny and endearing moments. That could be said for all of the employees; their personalities are so vividly detailed that when they clash it forces them to reflect on themselves, and those realizations stay with their characters and have been revisited throughout the show. As if they were real people, they face struggles from inner turmoil and resolve issues by gaining wisdom from each other and the knowledgeable guests. <br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
A subdued and calming opening starts off each episode, but it gradually opens and grows louder, much like the progression of the individual story arcs. The voice actresses do a good job at their parts and that anime cat lady thing, even if it&#039;s not outstanding it&#039;s still pretty good.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The character designs are of course adorable and they’re also very expressive, their designs are fairly varied but they’re given life through the characterizations. Environments are simple but appealing to the eyes. <br />
 <br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
I’m not usually one to advocate for moe, but Konohana Kitan surprised me in how realistic its core messages are. Funny scenarios, adorable characters, and poignant themes, Konahana Kitan is the most pleasant surprise I&#039;ve seen this year. <br />
<br />
In the second episode, the adorable and optimistic Yuzu imparts her simplistic yet poignant thoughts of life onto the strict and serious Satsuki which warms her heart and immediately strikes a visible connection between the two. The connection felt realistic to me because the belief they shared transcended the adorable animal-people world of Konohana Kitan and shot directly into the real one. <br />
The message is that you should enjoy life whenever you can because if you don&#039;t it will pass you by and fill you with regret.<br />
<br />
Provisional Score 8.1/10<br />
Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover, Konohana Kitan is a good show that&#039;s worth watching despite what it&#039;s aesthetic may imply upon your first judgment. <br />
The show&#039;s strongest point is how well the characters are written. However, not all of the main cast members haven&#039;t been fleshed out. I can see this issue being addressed in the future, as I update this review I&#039;ll comment on how it (hopefully) gets better.

    Do you like fox girls? Do you like yuri? Do you like heartwarming mythological moments? Then Konohana Kitan is for you! Konohana Kitan excels very well at two things: making appealing yuri scenes between the fox girls and providing heartwarming moments with interesting takes relating to Japanese folklore. And on those two merits, the show is able to succeed. <br />
<br />
The show seems to be divided between two different sections: moments that build up the character’s relationships to each other and moments that are more concerned with telling fantastical stories that attempt to warm up the heart. And while the show is able to succeed at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265707">
        each part individually when put together there is something a bit lacking. Take the fantastical folklore episodes, while there are many episodes that are not only able to use folklore to tell a compelling and unique story but also manage to be heartwarming and genuinely surprising. Separated from the rest of the work, they stand out as particularly strong episodes that do a good job of making one feel a greater connection with the world around them. It’s amazing what they are able to do with old stories of folklore to talk about the human condition and give hope to those that are watching. There is this sort of feeling of helplessness to what life can throw at one, but also a feeling of triumph of being able to overcome it. Whether it be a dream eating Baku or the story of a mother and her child, the show is able to make unexpected powerful moments out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
However, when half the show is dedicated to this it does have an effect on the rest of the show. Even though they are nice to watch, they are often focused on side characters who don’t have any barring on the main cast. Which isn’t necessarily a problem, especially when they are able to do it quite well, but it does lead to the character’s not getting as much development as they could be.<br />
<br />
The yuri moments also show this problem. The moments that show the bonds between the characters are all very touching and are just so adorable and loveable. But at the same time they also often cover the same ground. Furthermore, the amount of interactions between the group is limited because the main characters are often paired to the hip to their partner. While this does make for a nice one on one bond and provides some very satisfying and noteworthy episodes, it lacks the same sense of community that other CGDCT shows are able to richly show. <br />
<br />
It also doesn’t help that the show tries to have more characters than it can work with. The main characters are pretty nice. They all have distinct and likeable personalities. They have enough depth to them that they are interesting but sadly there isn’t enough depth to them to make them standout characters. Ren, Yuzu, Satsuki, and Natsume fall into this. They all have interesting traits and interact nicely between each other. However, the other cast members of Konohana Kitan suffer from lack of screentime or characterization. While Okiku gets some time to shine, Kiri and Sakura feel like one-note characters. They have some nice small moments but overall they feel more like afterthoughts than anything. <br />
<br />
Normally that isn’t a problem but the combined effect of having extra filler characters and having a lot of episodes focused on side characters means the main cast doesn’t get as fleshed out as they could be. Even though each of the episodes the main cast does get does a very good job of showing what drives them and what they’re like it still feels a bit shallow. Like there’s still more that can be dug into. I think part of this is the lack of other character interactions. When most of the character’s screentime is made up of another character they tend to get forced into roles. Yuzu and Satsuki are often going to act the same way around each other. Ditto with Ren and Natsume. While those interactions are nice it ends up leaving a more static view of their characters. People are not just defined by their interactions with one person, but with all sorts of people, and all of the different ways they react to different things. <br />
<br />
The art is quite nice and beautiful although the animation can be somewhat lackluster at times. It’s clear that there are several tricks they use in order to make them needless animation. And to be fair they work overall. The chibi fox blobs are very cute. That said when it leads to as little animation as there was in episode 5, it can be quite a problem. The art style is very nice though and it’s able to exude it’s aesthetic very well, which is quite nice for what it has going for it. The sound also helps with this, and the mellow and relaxing tracks are able to fit in with the soul-soothing hotel that they work at. The art-style and sound both are adept at enhancing whatever feel the show is trying to go for. <br />
<br />
Overall Konohana Kitan is a case of a story that is good in episode-sized chunks but when combined together it lacks the consistency to make it the super strong show that it could be. Even still it has really cute adorable yuri moments and really meaningful and emotional moments. And if you’re into that, like I am, I highly suggest it as it’ll have a lot of content that can warm one’s soul and fill one’s heart with sunshine. And if you’re not, I still think this show is strong enough to have things to offer. While I do have my complaints and issues with the development of the show, that doesn’t stop it from being an adorable blast of a show!

    The genre of Slice of life has been so riddled with all female casts of cute girls doing cute things that each season seems to have its own version of the trope with a slight difference in its storytelling and/or setting in order to give the show some ‘unique aspects’.  These aspects are usually easy to distinguish and end up seeming gimmicky cause at the end of the day; it’s still cute girls doing cute things.  But then you have Konohana Kitan, a show about cute kitsune girls doing…not just cute things in their daily lives.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
In a world between Earth and Heaven there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265736">
        lays a bathhouse called Konohanatei.  In this bathhouse, guests ranging from normal people to high-ranking gods attend this bathhouse for some nice rest and relaxation from the attending staff that care for all that pass through here.  It is here where a young kitsune by the name of Yuzu steps forth in the next step of her life as part of the attendant staff, coming in contact with the various individuals that end up at this place.<br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan is in a word, whimsical.  Each episode is structured as its own story based around either a story dedicated to a guest in the bathhouse, or the several attendants of Konohanatei, thus giving the show a nice blend of character and story that builds up the kind of world that’s established in this midway between life and death.  While indeed the show does have some emphasis on ‘cute girls doing cute things’ as all-female casts in this medium tend to showcase, the show is well aware of the relaxing and calm tone that it establishes and runs with it all the way to the end.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the stories are unique and interesting.  Based primarily around Shintoism concepts, the show really emphasizes the mystical in a very prominent way, as Yuzu’s experiences with the various guests give off a sense of wonder and amazement that I’ve found to be an aspect that’s very refreshing.  In comparison however, the stories based around the main cast I’d say aren’t personally as good, but still hold their own to provide enough depth and attention to the young attendants so that they feel more like characters rather than a cardboard figure that acts as the leeway to let the story we’re talking about happen.  (Looking at you, Isekai Shokudou)<br />
<br />
With even pacing and a huge focus on story and expanding the world on an episode-by-episode basis, Konohana Kitan stands as a heartwarming and relaxing series with a story that entertains more than teaches.  It knows the ground that it stands on, and firmly does so with extra emphasis on trying to be good and unique rather than fall into the trap of ‘cute girls doing cute things’.  Yes, that still kind of does happen, but it’s so few and far between that it really doesn’t matter.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Well made episodic stories<br />
+ Character development<br />
+ Knows what it is and sticks with it<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
The various attendants of Konohanatei take up I’d say…half of the existing episodes, with surprisingly enough, our main protagonist having the least with only one episode solely focused on her.<br />
<br />
As the newest attendant of Konohanatei, Yuzu is in short, a klutz.  She’s new to the job and the demands of being an attendant sort of turn her on her head because her naturally airheaded and innocent demeanor lead her to in some cases be more hindrance than helpful.  Nevertheless, the show establishes her as the main person to experience most if not all of the whimsical tales from the bathhouse’s various guests, sort of making up the lack of backstory/development screentime she gets from the series.  Beyond that, her naturally optimistic and child-like wonder helps give off a positive vibe of the show, which really adds to the experience.  On her own, I don’t think she’s all that amazing, but when put into context, she really does enhance the overall experience.<br />
<br />
Satsuki on the other hand is the polar opposite, being more strict (and prickly) compared to her assigned partner with dreams and aspirations that reach beyond a life working in the bathhouse.  On a base level, Satsuki is a tsundere, but she does have her shining moments where she softens up from her naturally strict demeanor, becoming a well rounded character especially when factoring in the episodes dedicated to her and the backstory we’re told about how she came to the bathhouse.  Personally, not my favorite character, but she has a lot of qualities that make her a respectable cast member. <br />
<br />
And then there’s Ren and Natsume.  Personally, I’m not a fan of these two mostly because their connection stems from the trope of a girl swooning over the oblivious tomboy who more often than not treats her like a princess through princess carry, extreme worriment, etc etc.  They’re eternally linked in this show, so much so that their episodes are ‘their’ episodes rather than a Ren or Natsume only episode.  Again, the show establishes quite a bit of depth for them so that they feel more alive, but based on personal bias alone, I just got vaguely annoyed that the show almost always dedicated their screentime together for yuribaiting.  <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the staff, we have Sakura, who gets no episodes to herself but is amusing and memorable in her own way, fox saber (Kiri) who is basically a really sassy and funny Artoria Pendragon with fox ears attached to her head (seriously though, the way she bundles her hair is EXACTLY LIKE THAT), and Okami, who really should get more screentime cause she’s also pretty funny too.  More or less they’re supplements to the ‘main cast’, but I wish they got more time to them cause at times they really stole the show.  As for the guests, there’s not much to say about them without delving into spoiler material.  Just know that any given guest can take half an episode to a full episode, each of them leaving a lasting impression because more than anything, their stories on how they came to the bathhouse, what their legend or story is, and what they leave behind, give them significance that add to the overall show.<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Hilarious and underused side cast<br />
+ Developed main cast<br />
+ Memorable stories<br />
-  Main cast is kinda tropeish<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
Produced by Lerche, the quality of Konohana Kitan shows us that it’s pretty.  It’s very pretty.  It’s about standard fare in terms of animation quality, but the light and airy color palette combined with a multitude of characters’ stills make the show calming and visually vibrant to look at.  Not only that, but several episodes shift around the color palette and lighting of a specific episode to put emphasis on the story that’s being told at the time, a nice touch that improves the whimsicality of the show.<br />
<br />
Another thing is the show’s comedic style.  Sure you get your standard comedy faces and stuff in order to have exaggerated expressions for comedy’s sake, but the really amusing thing I found was, since the characters are all kitsune, rather than use normal chibis, the show straight up turns them into cat-like blob creatures that shuffle around the screen.  Yes, while it’s much easier (and by extension cheaper) to animate than normal chibis, it’s unique and I have honest to god never seen a ‘chibi’ this funny before.  <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
+ Color palette and visual style add to the show’s tone<br />
+ (Personal Bias) Hilarious chibis<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
Initially going in and expecting the soundtrack to be just so moe pop song, both the show’s OP and ED, “Kokoro ni Tsubomi” and &quot;Haru Urara, Kimi to Sakihokoru&quot; exude a soft and calming beat with only the slightest push of energy in the ED to give it enough oomph to sound like a proper seiyuu song.  Personally I prefer the OP to its ED counterpart, as it more encapsulates the show’s atmosphere and overall tone much better, but both are definitely worthwhile listens if you’re trying to find something calming.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I totally did not just watch this show because I like kitsunes.  I swear on my good name.  While yes that is definitely one reason I was interested in the show to begin with, the other was how the show would actually present itself.  At first glance, I saw it as a bit of gamble, seeing if the ‘kitsune girls’ was going to be the show’s gimmick and it was just gonna be another round of moe tropes rehashed for the umpteenth time.  And I thankfully relieved.  A couple seasons ago, I reviewed a show called ‘Urara Meirochou’, which had a somewhat similar premise with a mix of moe and mystical, which ended up being more of the former than the latter.  I’d say that Konohana Kitan is that show done right, as it flips those two in importance and gives us something akin to Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou, which is a welcome sight since I very much am a fan of these lax yet magical shows.  <br />
<br />
Did I like this anime?<br />
<br />
While not one of my most anticipated watches, Konohana Kitan was certainly a rewarding experience.  I found myself in awe at some of the stories and really would’ve liked to have more, but all good things must come to an end.  Also, fox saber.  That is totally Artoria if you slapped on a pair of fox ears on her.  And she’s super sassy to boot.  She is so funny; why did we not get more of her?  Also the doll.  I find it amusing how we have an established character that spends most of her screentime mounting her trusty dream pig steed.  <br />
<br />
What didn’t I like about this anime?<br />
<br />
I feel like some of the dedicated episodes for Satsuki and Ren/Natsume were unneeded.  The characters were pretty established by that point and bolstering more of what we knew was something I felt was unnecessary, especially when the latter two have their entire story dedicated to yuribaiting.  Yuribaiting is fine, but I mean come on, you can do MORE than that.  <br />
<br />
Would I recommend this show?<br />
<br />
If you’re a fan of the likes of the two shows I mentioned before, Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou, then I’d say that Konohana Kitan is not that far from those two.  As I’ve stated many times cause I’m a broken record, the show is whimsical at its core, focusing more on the stories of people and the people themselves than establishing an overarching narrative.  It’s a relaxing and calm watch with only some fanservice (compared to most moe shows), and definitely seemed to have gone under the radar for a majority of the Fall 2017 season.  So if you’re looking for a good show that didn’t get much attention, this certainly fits the bill.

    Cute girls doing cute things? Mild yuri slice-of-life? It&#039;s a bit hard to differentiate yourself when you are competing with hallmarks like GochiUsa, Yuru Yuri, or the latest hits (looking at you Kobayashi&#039;s Maid Dragon!) <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t let KonoKitan&#039;s first 3 episodes fool you though. While it starts off slow introducing its main characters, I find its use of Japanese folklore, traditional customs, and legendary figures, to be fitting and clever. Ever heard of the Baku? Or the idea that dolls have souls? It&#039;s very interesting to see how KonoKitan weaves these concepts with its cast of characters in a slow-paced manner, while leaving commentaries on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262316">
        the ephemeral nature of life. Sounds like Natsume&#039;s Book of Friends? Yes I can see some of its vibes here.<br />
<br />
Characters-wise, we are treated to a somewhat-cliche group. The ever-naive Yuzu who occasionally offers advice beyond her years (and subsequently surprise her peers and customers), the rambunctious tomboy Natsume and her fellow interest Ren who acts ladylike, the younger sister walking in her sibling&#039;s shadow (Satsuki), and free-spirited Sakura. While this set of characters may seem all too familiar, and their interactions cliched, their antics still tug at your heart. <br />
<br />
If you like a slice-of-life series, seeing &quot;cute girls doing cute things&quot;, while having a Natsume&#039;s Book of Friends vibe, this is the anime for you.

    It&#039;s a SoL, it&#039;s for people who love Shoujo Ai CGDCT stuff, it&#039;s a feel-good show, but what it does, it not ONLY does great justice to it, but rather it propels it towards excellence at its finest, and is indeed one of the best shows of Fall 2017.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Yuzu, a fox girl, and a newcomer towards Konohanatei, learns to adjust from her previous life living in the woods, and immersing around with the Konohanatei crew of fox girls. Being the most innocent, clumsy and able to get lost very easily, her personality brings the charm towards the other characters (which I&#039;ll discuss in the Character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265734">
        section) and the vastly beautiful world around her as she bonds with the characters.<br />

One thing I&#039;ve gotta say that the premise is set really well, for the story is the layer of the cake towards the icing (which are the characters themselves), and the blending of the both could not be any better, and although the manga source is on hiatus, I&#039;m honestly glad the anime adaptation doesn&#039;t withdraw from the fact to build upon the greatness of the manga and making the show look as lush as possible.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Absolutely, the strongest point of Konohana Kitan is it&#039;s characters and their development and involvement towards one another.<br />
<br />
Newcomer Yuzu, voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Ono (Jun from Tenshi no 3P) is a delight to watch, though my minor gripe is that she&#039;s one of the main characters, yet the show plainly forces her in the limelight when she shouldn&#039;t have. The innocent, plain looking young fox girl always gets into trouble, though she quickly learns with a heart of gold, and preaches her understanding in a way that doesn&#039;t offend the other party in a very peaceful manner.<br />
<br />
Satsuki mainly acts as Yuzu&#039;s caretaker since her arrival on Day 1, but her actions towards Yuzu may be harsh, but in a good way of a Senpai looking out for her junior, treating her both as a fellow attendant, and a friend.<br />
<br />
Sakura is downright creepy when you take a look at her at first glance, but then as the series progresses you will realize that she is nothing that we know of, until the arrival of the doll and the pig, to which she is aggressive towards them, but not to worry, we know she has a kind heart (from within).<br />
<br />
Ren is the typical yuri mess, knowing that her love for tomboy Natsume goes through the roof, and at times, like Yuzu, will mess up, in the name of love (or in front of Natsume), but other than that, she still serves diligently as another attendant at Konohanatei.<br />
<br />
Natsume, being a tomboy, is fearless, and always shields the others when danger, whether minor or major happens and earns the reputation of the capable attendant.<br />
<br />
Overall, the characters and the VAs supporting them have done a tremendous job at keeping their intensity at being fair and fresh, and props especially to Yuzu&#039;s VA for an excellent job well done immersing in the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation:<br />
Veteran studio Lerche, being capable of their production values, has descended unto us a beautiful and gorgeous show that ties in with the human-spirit interconnection and the folklore settings that blend so well together. You can definitely see it in most places, and the always funny chibi fox feels always never ceases to humor me, that by the end of the episodes it feels like a moment of time has passed, and always left wanting for more. Props to studio Lerche for another adaptation that has done exceptionally with lush colour and details galore.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Another strong point for the show is at its slow but nice and immersive OST and BGM. The nice, refreshing tinkles and tingles of the OP and various EDs along with the BGM just elevates the experience of watching this show. Another area to sing praises of this show.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Konohana Kitan is the equivalent of Winter 2017&#039;s Urara Meirochou, but presented better in every way possible. The lush visuals, the nice sounds, what more could you want from a CGDCT and Shoujo Ai series that leaves you wanting for more? Love this series as a whole as it serves the break you might need if you&#039;re invested in this show. Watch it if you can, it&#039;s great fun!

    I&#039;m not a big fan of moe series, yet some friends recommended me this one, at first, it caught my interest because of the Shoujo Ai elements it posesses, but so far within 4 episodes, I got to see an anime which is a very heartwarming experience. You can expect light fanservice on this anime, very intended girl x girl relationships and very cute moments, so if you don&#039;t have anything against it, this anime will be a pleasant watch for you.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Overall Section<br />
<br />
There isn&#039;t much story to tell, but the concept goes around an Inn that runs by foxes, if you remember Isekai Shokudou,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261705">
        the concept is quite similar, but instead of serving food and focusing on side characters, this anime focuses on the main lead, their relationships and how they succeed on their work... Of course with a touch of slice of life, we will have heartwarming stories and the background story of each character will be revealed within time. 6/10<br />
<br />
The animation of this show is pretty good looking, the main characters are very beautiful with their &quot;moe-inducing&quot; cuteness. I&#039;ll also like to say that this anime reminds me of &quot;Amanchu!&quot;, mostly because Yuzu and her random faces reminds me of Hikari&#039;s dumb face (and how her cuteness involves her relationship with Satsuki just as Hikari has a really good chemistry with her diving partner) also the way that the &quot;dumb looking foxes&quot; look is funny and pretty much on point for comic relief. 8/10<br />
<br />
The sound department of this anime is your typical set of anime girl voices... well... cute anime girl voices, it goes well for how each one of them is designed. The background OST is quite good when it comes to scenes that requires a really smooth soundtrack, be it sad, heartwarming or comic relief, it manages to hit me everytime. 8/10<br />
<br />
About the characters, well we have Tsundere, Loli, Dumbass, Possesive, eh... boy looking girl?, the lead and the big wolf chief. Might sound a bit generic, but even if it is, their development is what makes this show what it is: Heartwarming, oh yeah and they can also be funny and cute, so there is variety here, if you want to have diabetes, you came to the right place. 7/10<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve gotta say, I didn&#039;t expect to like this quite as much as I watched 4 episodes straight. And I&#039;ll probably end loving it even more the more I watch it, having a weekly doses of cuteness can&#039;t be bad for your heart 8/10<br />
<br />
Overall 7,4(7)/10: A cute girls doing cute stuff, now with foxes, very heartwarming, and cute foxes and diabetes inducing foxes and cute foxes... did I already state that the foxes are cute?

WORDS OF GRATITUDE<br />
==============<br />
<br />
It&#039;s pretty rare for me to love a series this much! This is definitely my Anime of the Year 2017. I love this series so much and I am so glad I decided to pick it up. Thank you the staff behind Konohana Kitan. Thank you Amano Sakuya sensei. Thank you everyone who supported this show. I am really grateful to all of you. It has been a wonderful ride that I won&#039;t easily forget in the near future. I hope down in the bottom of my heart for the Blu-Ray sales of this anime to reach the staff&#039;s expectations and further more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265967">
        to exceed it. I also wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. After all those gratitude, let&#039;s hop into my review for the MASTERPIECE that goes by the name of &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot;, a real hidden gem that has yet to be discovered by the anime community. <br />
<br />
=====<br />
REVIEW<br />
=====<br />
<br />
It is not often I find a moe anime that entertained me this much. Konohana Kitan tells a tale of our main characters working in a hot spring inn. Yes, tale. It isn&#039;t your normal moe working anime such as New Game, or even serious anime like Sakura Quest. Konohana Kitan is presented in an episodic way, in which each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale, sometimes it can be about family and sometime it can be about friendship. <br />
<br />
Now one misconception people have with this anime is that it is just a pure Shoujo-Ai/Soft-Yuri anime and I would like to say...yes this is a Shoujo-Ai anime, and it isn&#039;t your typical moe Shoujo-Ai out there where fans keeps on shipping two characters together, in this anime the ship actually sails. It&#039;s very clear which character will end up with which character after a few episodes in. However, it isn&#039;t just the Shoujo-Ai that stands out, it&#039;s also how the story in each episode is told. <br />
<br />
As I stated before, each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale. The story in each episode is very relatable. Sometimes, they will dedicate an entire episode to focus on telling you more about the characters and further developing their romantic relationship, in which makes you like them even more.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, each character in this anime is cute and fun to watch. Moreover, they are also well developed and likable. Personally, there isn&#039;t any character in this series that I hate/dislike, every character to me has their own charm and are well fleshed out. Although at first glance you might think that this is your typical moe character you can see every season, but trust me, they are more than that.<br />
<br />
The music in this anime is soothing and relaxing. The opening sequence is based on how the workers of a hot spring inn start their work. The staff actually did research to make the opening sequence more realistic and relatable. The ending theme is also pretty heartwarming. Background music used in each scene brings out the heartwarming nature of this anime even more. <br />
<br />
The part that surprised me the most is the art and animation, especially the background art. It&#039;s outstanding. I never thought I would want to praise the background team this much but they seriously did their job perfectly, Each background is so carefully and seriously drawn until it&#039;s hard to find flaws in them. The animation, especially when there is sakura petals flying around, is beautifully animated. Such a gorgeous animation coming from Lerche, just wow!<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoy watching this anime very much! This is a masterpiece in my opinion. Nothing beats the day I can sit down and enjoy myself watching this series. If you are a fan of moe anime or you just want a comfy heartwarming anime to watch, then do yourself a favor and watch Konohana Kitan. I bet you won&#039;t ever be disappointed cause I surely didn&#039;t.

    Would love to give this anime a 10 but I&#039;ll keep it at a 9 for now. It is one of those anime I went just wanting to see you know, cute girls doing cute stuff because who doesn&#039;t love fox girls right? They are so freaking adorable! Basing off the cover you would assume it&#039;s just one of those adorable anime and on the surface you are right. But this anime is so so much more than just cute fox girls. It has a lot of different stories within the main story or the main concept. Finding a place to call home... <br />
<br />
It can

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373790">
        be brush aside as a bunch of meaningless stories but when you get to the end and if you were paying attention, it tells a very beautiful story overall. I think it&#039;s worth a watch for those who love just heart warming stories. This is pretty wholesome in itself too. I enjoyed every episode and I don&#039;t mind the added lair of cuteness. Don&#039;t be thrown off by the &quot;Yuri&quot; or Shoujo Ai tag. There&#039;s barely anything, it&#039;s just like any other anime with a bunch of cute girls. <br />
<br />
So if you want a sweet and cute but a pretty wholesome and a satisfying conclusion, then it&#039;s worth a watch. I mean satisfying as in, if it was not to have a season 2 I&#039;m okay with it, but it&#039;s left room if there was to be one too. <br />
<br />
Overall 9.4/10 I might give it a 10 after a rewatch to catch things I missed

    This series sure came out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
When I first saw it on MAL I barely even glanced at it, I thought it was just going to be a generic Cute Girls Doing Cute Things anime, but my god is it heartwarming. <br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan is an episodic slice of life story about these fox girls that work at Konohanatei, a hot springs for the gods. It seems to exist between life and death, though it&#039;s never fully explained. There&#039;s a lot in this series that&#039;s not fully explained, but because of its nature I think fully explaining things would ruin it a little. <br />
<br />
Since the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265836">
        attendants at Konohanatei consistently serve Japanese kami, a lot of the plot lines involve Japanese legends. It gives off a similar vibe to Spirited Away, though in a more human-like modern anime style. <br />
<br />
There are a few backstories that could be fleshed out, like I&#039;m really curious about Yuzu&#039;s past, and Ren, Satsuki, and Okiku definitely get more character development than the rest of them, but it&#039;s just so good, it made me smile, it was heartwarming, it was sad at times, it was funny, it was cute, watch this series I want it to get a season 2. <br />
<br />
It is worth noting that it aired on the same day as Urahara, so my opinion might have been inflated, though I did wait until the next day to watch the final episode and it&#039;s still just as good when not sitting next to the dumpster.

    Hiya! The 50th Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews has arrived! And this time we have such a darling show to talk about. I absolutely adored my time with the fox girls of Konohana Kitan (as is my tradition, the dubbed version). It was heartwarming, funny, and very interesting with its light exploration of Japanese mythology. I recommend this series heartily for those &#039;go in blind&#039; types seeing this. Will the RTLR wall of inn patrons get bigger? Lets rock this house.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The story isn&#039;t anything to get too excited over, as the plot has been used many different times. The poor girl basically has nowhere to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308576">
        go, is thrust into a job with others, and must learn not only to be a good employee, but also to find a place within the &#039;family&#039;. I was instantly reminded of Kanamemo, and in a lot of ways this title is similar, though they pulled it off by leaps and bounds better than former series. The biggest, and the most interesting difference to me is that Konohana is set in the spirit realm, kind of a place halfway between earth and the afterlife (heaven, whatever). That gives the show the ability to include outlandish guests such as gods and mystical creatures, and even normal mortal humans. In fact the entire staff (save one late entry) are all mystical fox girls themselves. The story that follows is a slice of life type entry where we see how the clumsy main character causes all sorts of problems, but her wonderful charisma and honest heart win over both the staff and the guests. Eventually she become proficient enough at her job to truly be a member of the Konohana family. <br />
<br />
Has this story been done many times before? Yes. But the inclusion of the spirit realm, the mystical elements and the existence of magical creatures seems to set this story apart for me, and had me rooting for all the guests at the end, not just the staff. The fairly self contained stories run the gamut from a mystical girl who weaves nonstop to create a beautiful part of our world, to a priest that has a &#039;possessed&#039; doll he&#039;s reluctant to exorcise, instead deciding to leave her with the inn staff, to finally a mortal woman dealing with heart breaking sadness that came to the inn to have her final wish come true before passing on to the hereafter. The stories themselves are engaging and I found myself looking forward to each and every episode. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
I would have scored the art at a 9, but they do a LOT of comedy bits in it where when in a stressful or odd situation, the girl or girls will be portrayed as kind of oblong, detail-less blobs, primarily when they are scared or such. This might be hard for me to describe properly, but once you see it the first time, you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about. There are lots of moments where the comedy takes a firm hold of a scene and these tropes appear. I don&#039;t mind them, they did punctuate the comedy of those scenes, but I think the story would have been better served without so many of them. <br />
<br />
Otherwise the art is wonderful, I like the detail in the eyes, the ability the art had to convey emotion without words. The animation seemed smooth enough to me. I will mention I did not care for the weird priest with the doll and his super cucumber shaped skull. Everything else looked good, and I always enjoyed when they showed the exterior of the inn, with it&#039;s beautiful architecture. <br />
<br />
Sound 8:<br />
Another I might have scored higher if it wasn&#039;t for the main character Yuzu&#039;s voice. She sounds appropriately innocent, but her voice does stray close to ear straining fairly often. She never got bad enough to grate my nerves, but I wish they could have made her a little less ditsy sounding. The other girls voices are all really well done, fitting their characters nicely. <br />
<br />
The opening and closer are nice, I especially liked the opener quite a bit. Seemed fitting for a show about a girl coming to age and finding her place in the world. The background music is never intrusive, and knows when to rise up and when to quiet down. I found the music enhancing my enjoyment. The sound effects for the comedy bits were funny, if not completely predictable. <br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
There are many different characters in the show, though not as many as some ensemble casts. There&#039;s the girl who wants to be a priestess but ended up at the hotel instead while her sister got her priestess job. She harbors resentment over this, but there&#039;s more to the story than even she knows. <br />
<br />
The boss of the inn is a literal fox (who can somehow appear human with just a little makeup) who is strong, but very fair to her girls, taking good care of them even if she sounds a little gruff sometimes. <br />
<br />
The head servant is an affable, laid back kind of gal that takes it all in stride, and is always there with words of encouragement or wisdom for Yuzu as she bungles a job, or gets on everyone else&#039;s nerves. <br />
<br />
The obligatory mean girl is there, straight and stern as always. She&#039;s the girl who wanted to serve the gods but her parents made her go to the inn instead. A lot of her anger has to do with the fact that the only knows a snippet of what happened when the decision was made by her parents. That&#039;s often the case with people, things happen, and they think the know the whole story, when in fact they only know a tiny bit of it. This girl tends to have to herd Yuzu around and teach her the job, something she grumbles about constantly. <br />
<br />
There are a few other characters as well, especially the awesome almost silent Sakura, who is a freaky little girl with some strange habits. The cast is well rounded out with personalities that clash enough for drama, but never so much as to break the bonds of love between them. Each member shares a fair bit of screen time so your &#039;best girl&#039; likely will get enough of a story and scenes to make a fan of any of the girls happy. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
It all comes together nicely, this story about an inn set in the spirit realm full of fox girls, talking mice, gods, holy men, and even humans. The comedy keeps it from getting too bogged down and taking itself too seriously, but there are episodes (one in particular) that had me all kinds of misty eyed. It was a joy to watch Yuzu and the girls get into their hijinks and carry on. Keep an eye out for the magic egg. In the dubbed version there is one hell of a funny exchange regarding it. I would, and probably will, watch this anime again sometime, so my enjoyment should be more than obvious. <br />
<br />
Best Girl: No surprises here: Satsuki. Give me the straight laced, uptight, mean girl every single time. Even though she tries so hard to be tough, she really is a big softy inside. But I like her better in butt-kicking mode. And purple hair! Gotta love that too!<br />
<br />
I wish I could go to a hot-spring inn between the earth and the afterlife. Maybe someone will build one someday. Until then I have the memories of the fun I had watching this anime to hold me over. As for the RTLR wall of fox girls, Satsuki scores a spot, bumping Emma Frost from her post (see not just anime girls, though it&#039;s starting to get that way!) Take a trip to the inn, I think you&#039;ll enjoy it. And with that review 50 is in the books!

    &quot;Cute fox girls doing cute things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan is the literal definition of &quot;cute girls&quot; and &quot;kitsune&quot;. Similar to Hanasaku Iroha, but more cute, moe girls that&#039;ll make you want to protect them at all cost. There are also some traces of Shoujo Ai, but not to the point where a borderline scale is needed. <br />
<br />
This anime is just relaxing and fun to watch, there&#039;s not too much pressure. And in every episode, you get this &quot;comfortable&quot; feeling of pretty much cute, fox girls working. Absolutely fantastic. <br />
<br />
Story : 10/10<br />
<br />
The story is pretty much cute fox girls doing cute things.. That&#039;s about it. <br />
<br />
Art :

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315796">
        10/10 <br />
<br />
At first before I watched this anime, I thought the art would me mediocre. But after watching the first episode.<br />
<br />
I think I&#039;m blind now. <br />
<br />
Sound : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Oh my lord. The sound of the fox girls ( especially Yuzu ) is too fucking kawaii. It&#039;s cruel.. The OP also gives you a relaxing sensation which is great. <br />
<br />
Character : 9.9/10<br />
<br />
What made the anime even greater than cute fox girls doing cute things is there&#039;s actually character developments. And really good ones. Some even left me in tears of happiness ( 0 depression ) <br />
<br />
Though, I find Ren and Natsume a waste of time and feel like they&#039;ve gotten too much screen-time. ( no offense ) <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this anime. It&#039;s peaceful, It&#039;s relaxing, It&#039;s joyous. Pretty much what I wanted after watching the most cancerous anime I&#039;ve ever seen in my entire life &quot;Diabolik Lovers&quot;. <br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10 <br />
<br />
This show literally cleaned the cancer I got from Diabolik Lovers. I even cried slightly after the anime ended not because it&#039;s depressing. But the experience I had with it was beautiful. Studio Lerche, thank you very much for producing a masterpiece. I have loved your shows ever since Assassination Classroom. Keep up the good work! <br />
<br />
Like fox? Like cute girls? Watch this. You won&#039;t go to jail.

    This anime looks and sounds sooooo... good, it&#039;s so warm, cute and heartwarming and it&#039;s perfect to watch on winter eves. It brings joy and happiness to it&#039;s audience. It has very vibrant colours and crisp visuals. Its music is very lighthearted and complements the visuals well. Konohanatei is a example of a well made anime and the story is simple abut it comes full circle and feels complete. There are some slower moments but when you are bombarded with so pretty visuals you just can&#039;t stop staring at them. There are also a ton of Japanese culture references from traditions to gods and spirits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review265746">
        that it is amazing and they are woven into the story neatly. Characters are ûber cute and very moe but tone is light that it could appeal to people who might not like moe-animes. <br />
<br />
This anime is sugar coated candy with so pretty exterior and with very lighthearted and culturally packed center that it almost eats your teeth away. This is a must for kemono-girl and moe fans. I give it 8,5/10 Rounded to 9/10. <br />
Warming and kind, perfect with cold weather just like hot cocoa.

    Konohana Kitan (2017)<br />
<br />
All you really need to know about this show is simply that its Cute Fox Girls Do Cute Things. <br />
<br />
The show is really heartwarming and relaxing to watch. It gives off a really nice chilled out vibe. There are moments of excitement but it all comes back to the relaxation of the show. <br />
<br />
Yuzu our protagonist was raised by a human in a shrine after being found frozen in the wilderness. She grows up in a small mountain community very isolated and is very low of knowledge of the rest of the world she lives in. She is a lovely character who is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324641">
        someone you care for deeply during the show. <br />
<br />
The other fox girls all fill in nice tropes but in the best way possible. If you read the manga you see all the girls are paired up with basically their romantic partners. It is a Shoujo Ai after all. <br />
<br />
The show has some great stories and every episode is different. The best episode for emphasis on just amazement was episode 8. The episode is really humble and does things in a different way. <br />
<br />
During the show, you learn early on that the Inn is in a place in between worlds. This by how the story goes makes it feel like perhaps Yuzu had died in a previous life and was found to be raised to continue living in this world but who knows. That is just a theory of mine.  <br />
<br />
The finale episode is a bit of a time warp but has a really heartfelt ending that brings a full circle to the existence of the Inn. Tsubaki our innkeeper gets a really good development in a short time that shows her story in the nicest way possible. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the show is really great and absolutely worth watching. I think it would have really benefited a second season or some OVAs.<br />

    Konohana Kitan is a fantasy, slice of life from Lerche based off of a manga. So, the studio behind Danganronpa and Given. The original manga was written by Amano Sakuya, who I&#039;m not familiar with. But it&#039;s fantasy month, so let&#039;s take a look and see what they have to offer. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Yuzu is a kitsune who was raised by a priestess. In order to help her grow, she&#039;s sent to work as an attendant at Konohanatei, a hot spring inn used by Gods and all manner of beings straight out of folklore. At the inn, she quickly develops a blatantly romantic interest in Satsuki, another

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372176">
        of the attendants. The anime follows the pair of them as well as the other girls working at the Inn as they have interesting encounters. <br />
<br />
The only real &quot;flaw&quot; of the series is that it is highly episodic. For a lot of the episodes, it doesn&#039;t matter what order you watch them in since what happens won&#039;t really be brought up again. Which is pretty common in slice of life works, but it&#039;s also an aspect that some people will find off-putting. And while the series is mostly pretty funny, it does have a few jokes that are far too obvious and fall a bit flat. Like, it&#039;s kind of obvious what the joke is going to be when the grandparents come to the Inn with their grandchild.<br />
<br />
There are a couple elements in this series I really appreciate. The first is the way they use a lot of different folk lore creatures and subvert expectations for them. The cursed doll, Okiku, being the most prominent example. And that does make it consistently interesting to see what kind of creature they&#039;ll encounter next and what the series will do with it. The series is also really good at setting up an aesthetic that&#039;s funny but also kind of calming. It makes for a very relaxing series. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
There are two things I really like about the characters. I like their les-yay fuelled dynamics. I think they&#039;re nicely set up and handled. I also appreciate the way every character is somewhat archetypical, but has some kind of element that elevates them beyond that archetype and makes them unique. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve talked about many times, starting with an archetype is fine but in general you want to elevate the character beyond that to make them more interesting. Even the minor characters who appear for one episode are more complex than the one note characters some anime I could mention have as major characters. Looking at you, Pokemon. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the art in this series. The character designs are nice. The outfits are well done, usually quite cute as well. The backgrounds can be outright gorgeous at times. Especially during the whole sequence where Yuzu and Satsuki visit the shrine. And even though the series is set at a Hot Spring Inn, it never delves into pure fan-service. It keeps its bathing scenes fairly subdued. If I had any criticism of the art, it would be that the series shows the characters in their silly, blob-like forms a bit too often. I get it, it&#039;s a comedic aesthetic, but it would work better in that regard if it was used more conservatively for emphasis. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The acting is really well done. Oono Yuuko, Hata Sawako, Kubota Risa, Suwa Ayaka, Numakura Manami, Kakuma Ai and Ogata Megumi all deliver strong performances. There&#039;s honestly no one in the cast who does badly. The music is nicely composed. Full credit to Kikuchi Hajime.<br />
<br />
Ho-yay: <br />
<br />
There is a lot. Not one of the girls in the main cast comes across as straight. Yuzu and Satsuki clearly have a budding attraction going. Ren and Natsume are very blatantly romantically interested in each other. Satsuki&#039;s sister hits on other girls when she comes to the Inn. So, yeah there&#039;s a lot of les-yay.<br />
 <br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
1. Have a bit more structure. I&#039;m not saying the series has to have a strong underlying narrative. But I do think they could do more to reference prior events and establish a definitive order for the episodes instead of having it set up so that it mostly doesn&#039;t matter what order you watch them in.<br />
<br />
2. Be a little more surprising with your big gags. It&#039;s fine to have some quick gags where the joke is kind of obvious, but it doesn&#039;t work that well when you have a long joke with a lot of set up that has a predictable pay off. <br />
<br />
3. Use the simpler, gag art style more sparingly. It just has more of an impact and, because the regular style looks a lot better, that&#039;s also a benefit.<br />
 <br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this series quite a bit. It&#039;s charming. The characters are endearing. It&#039;s clever with the way it uses folklore. And the character dynamics are really cute. So, I&#039;m giving it a solid 8/10.

    Konohana Kitan was a warm moe anime that talk about different folklore of Japan which it was nice to watch. <br />
<br />
The anime&#039;s story is the strongest point it has, due to the different tales it talks about and the plot twists that develops throughout the series. It was a pretty cute anime and sometimes it seems kind of boring and slow, but at the end of the day is nice. the art and animations was very good in a simple manner but nothing to stand out and at times it didn&#039;t seem constant. I honestly couldn&#039;t like the characters or their voices, they seem weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review266062">
        to me, which made harder to watch the anime. I personally didn&#039;t love it nor hate it the anime and I cannot say I enjoy it to some extent. <br />
<br />
I recommend you to watch it if you are into moe anime and want to know some tales from Japan, but be aware that it has a slow pace. <br />

    I went into Konohana Kitan expecting another typical all girl cast sol show in the likes of &quot;Hinako Note&quot;, &quot;Gabriel Dropout&quot;, &quot;Urara Meirochou&quot;,&quot;Kiniro Moasic&quot;...etc. But do you see me writing a review for those? No. So why am I writing this?<br />
Story (9): The series is a collection of short stories that happens at Konohana; a high class traditional hotel in a world of Japanese/Eastern mythology. Each episode consists of two stories pertaining to either the main cast or one of the eccentric guest(s). The story takes full advantage of the setting and excels in the &quot;show not tell&quot; principle. <br />
Art (9): I went in expecting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262325">
        this anime to cut corners in animation/art, I was willing to give it some slack thinking they probably had a smaller budget compared to other animes. But wow... I was blown away immediately by just the still shots in the op (beautiful water effects in one particular shot). The background sets are great looking throughout, rain effects are well done, the show is filled with interesting characters, and designs of the main characters are also solid. The creative use of colour is at the next level compared to your average anime.<br />
Sound (8): Great intro that sets the mood. The bgm is noticeably good and sound effects are done just as well as any other anime. The VAs all do a decent enough job, no complaints. They switch up the ed quite frequently and it&#039;s refreshing. Overall the music isn&#039;t exactly too memorable but imo it&#039;s above average.<br />
Character (8): Character driven shows like this one need to have good characters. Does it have good characters? Yes. Does it have great characters? No. Everyone was likeable and unique but none of them was really outstanding. Most of them have typical character tropes seen plenty of times before. What&#039;s making me give an 8 is when they come together, the pairings plays well off of each other and everyone gets a chance in the spotlight. Not to mention the world they live in is filled with amusing mythological beings.<br />
Enjoyment (8): I personally found this much more enjoyable than the other recent sols previously mentioned. The vast majority of jokes lands or are at least chuckle worthy. The show seamlessly transports you into this world they&#039;ve established, allowing you to forget about the shitter real one for its duration. I should also mention how this anime excels in both establishing and changing the mood. Don&#039;t be surprised by the occasional ride on an emotional rollercoaster. <br />
Overall (8): So why does this deserve a review? Because compared to other sols this one truly stands out. Konohana Kitan isn&#039;t primarily driven by the need to make a joke at the end like every other sol. The true driving force here is the desire to tell a story. This fundamental difference  makes Konohana Kitan unique, refreshing and worthy of taking the time to write a review on.

    I strongly recommend you to watch &quot;Konohana Kitan,&quot; especially those who are interested in &quot;yuri&quot; culture but still hesitating to get involved with it.<br />
<br />
I know some of you avoid &quot;yuri&quot; culture, saying &#039;I&#039;m not interested in it,&#039; or, &#039;I don&#039;t know well what is yuri.&#039;<br />
True, &quot;yuri&quot; culture is a one which is not well-recognized also in Japan. It is often misunderstood. Furthermore, even among &quot;yuri&quot; culture fans there are some conflicts over the definition of the term &quot;yuri.&quot; Some says that &quot;yuri&quot; is equal to a term &quot;girls&#039; love&quot; or &quot;lez (shorten form of lesbians).&quot; On the other hands, others argue a word &quot;yuri&quot; focuses

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271470">
        on spirituality of girls and therefore sometimes includes friendship while sometimes excludes &quot;girls&#039; love.&quot; It is a confusing problem, so I won&#039;t talk about it here.<br />
What is sure is, although there are some groups in &quot;yuri&quot; culture, all of them admit that &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; is a genuine &quot;yuri&quot; work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; is about bit-strange lives in a Japanese hotel (actually &#039;Kitan&#039; stands for &#039;a strange story,&#039; but in this title a Chinese character of &#039;ki&#039; is different from that in usual use.) A protagonist, Yuzu, is a new face of nakai (waitress.) She spends a bit odd but calm days there with her colleagues.<br />
<br />
The main theme of this work is to express growing relationships between a few pairs of couples: Yuzu and Satsuki, Natsume and Ren, and Sakura and Kiri. <br />
These three couples are all &quot;yuri,&quot; that is true, but they are different from each other, and that&#039;s why I recommend beginners to watch &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; first, for by doing so you can understand the framework of &quot;yuri.&quot;<br />
The first couple, Yuzu and Satsuki&#039; s relationship is a typical one, I mean, it is popular in &quot;yuri&quot; culture. One is an innocent, gentle girl and friendly to anyone, while the other is strict but actually kind. In such cases the strict one has often already noticed actual feelings of oneself towards the innocent one. In this specific case, thanks to Yuzu&#039;s effort and personalities, Satsuki, the strict and stubborn one, gradually opens her mind towards Yuzu. &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; precisely describes the change of Satsuki&#039;s attitude towards Yuzu throughout  a episode and the series, which is highly reputed among &quot;yuri&quot; culture fan, included me.<br />
The second pair, Natsuki and Ren, is a little easier to grasp, for a girl is obviously in love with the other. A boyish one seems to be childish, not to understand girls&#039; emotions. The girlish one sometimes gets angry to the other, but in the end she again falls in love to the other. This  structure is similar to that of shoujo manga, so you might get to be familiar with this relationship sooner. Of course, this relationship is also &quot;yuri.&quot; A bit complicated?<br />
The last one, Sakura and Kiri, is a so-called &#039;oneloli&#039; couple, I suppose. Why I cannot declare is that it is a bit far from the mainstream of &#039;oneloli&#039; today. &#039;One (not a number!)&#039; is a shorten form of &#039;oneesan (=an elder sister, an elder woman),&#039; and &#039;loli&#039; means, you know, &#039;a girl, especially an elementary school student.&#039; This relationship focuses on &lt;mothership,&gt; a personality of being mother or an elder woman, and on traits of really a young child. It is different from the relationship of real mother and daughter, so please be careful. Kiri is just a mature woman, and Sakura is just a child, which is the epitome of &#039;oneloli.&#039; This is a difficult couple to understand, but you might gradually get familiar with it.<br />
As above, each couple has its own features. What is excellent is that &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; has succeeded to describe all the features of each couple. It is not an easy task; rather, a tough challenge. The creator of the original work understand &quot;yuri&quot; culture deeply and also anime staff makes effort to reproduce the atmosphere the original has. The very fruit of such works is the anime series of &quot;Konohana Kitan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anime staffs have really tried hard to reconstruct the original. Character designs are almost the same to those of the original manga. They also focus on background arts: using CG carefully, they makes backgrounds full with Japanese traditional sense, such as washitsu, a Japanese garden and so on.<br />
Japanese cultures are also found in many parts: &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; pays attention to the change of four seasons, and express it with plots, backgrounds, and detailed BGMs. &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; carefully describes a tiny tiny transition of girls&#039; delicate emotions with sophisticated aura which is created by each element.<br />
Totally, &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot; is also a quality-guaranteed anime. This is also a reason why I would like you to see it.<br />
<br />
I want to stress that &quot;yuri&quot; is not a merely &quot;girls&#039; love,&quot; not even friendships between girls. In Japan there are an amount of &quot;yuri&quot; manga whose protagonists are matured women (mainly 20~29 years old.)  This fact implies that &quot;yuri&quot; is not so strongly connected with ages. I know this fact may confuse you. Such difficulties are causes of avoidance. However, I also feel that it is plenty numbers of sub-categories that have been promoting today&#039;s growth of &quot;yuri&quot; culture. I hope you comes in contact with &quot;yuri&quot; culture by watching &quot;Konohana Kitan.&quot; It is only you who know the answer to this question: &#039;what is a funny point of &quot;yuri&quot; cultures?&#039;  It&#039;s time for you to search for your own answer.

    Konohana Kitan has the premise to be a decent slice of life, but falls pathetically short. I really wanted to stick with it longer, but this anime is just awful in so many aspects.<br />
<br />
Konohana Kitan suffers from some of the worst pacing in anime I&#039;ve ever seen. The writing feels like a high school student wrote the script for every episode in under a couple hours with a mandatory so-many-hundred word goal. From the very first episode, no effort is put towards building a halfway decent foundation for the rest of the show. The main character becomes attached to other characters absurdly fast, and just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313539">
        makes every interaction onward feel hollow and forced. There&#039;s also fanservice FOUR MINUTES INTO THE FIRST EPISODE, those four minutes include the opening theme. Fanservice is fine to an extent, but so soon in the FIRST episode??? Really???<br />
<br />
The art is dreadful and lacks any soul. Oh my god, where to start? Backgrounds look like they are public domain art and do not have much detail to them, even if they are focused on heavily in a scene. The animation is literally THE worst I&#039;ve witnessed in anime yet. So many corners were cut that it really makes this anime feel like it was made in a sweatshop with a strict time limit, and the employees were paid a few cents per frame without any supervisor to approve the frames beforehand. Walking animations are often nonexistent, replaced with torso shots of characters bobbing perfectly vertically up and down. Conversations between characters will sometimes be nothing but extremely zoomed in shots of character&#039;s faces, so zoomed in that you can&#039;t even see their hair or shoulders. Sometimes characters won&#039;t even have ANY animation, and will just be a JPEG sliding around. Sometimes there won&#039;t even be a character! You can only do the &quot;hahaha simplified scribble girl&quot; bit so many times every episode until it&#039;s obvious you just didn&#039;t have the budget to make an anime. Often this is done in the moments it would be most disorienting to the viewer. Eyes and heads rarely track movements, if you&#039;re lucky enough to be treated to a scene where a character would have something to track.<br />
<br />
The sound is also pretty shit. Bland background music, overly-lengthy and uninteresting opening theme. Nothing really stood out to me besides the music being very lackluster. The audio effects themselves aside from music are just as bad. Moments where characters would obviously have audible footsteps have no footstep sounds whatsoever and it&#039;s very disorienting.<br />
<br />
I think the creators were heavily restricted by budget and did not have any passion to create something besides &quot;HAHA KAWAII FOX GIRLS AND THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME :)&quot;. This is the only anime that&#039;s legitimately angered me to watch, as I really expected it to be something halfway decent, but all I got was a waste of ~40 minutes plus the time it took to write this review. It does NOTHING remotely well, and I could never see myself watching this without considering it wasted time I could&#039;ve spent watching something better.
