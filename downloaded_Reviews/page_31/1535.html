    &quot;It&#039;s just fiction, after all. Some people say it&#039;s just for fun. But it can make someone happy, or even end up helping someone.&quot; -Osamu Kuuga<br />

The Gundam Build series has been on a decline ever since the first installment came out in Fall 2013. Gundam Build Fighters was a fun shounen-like battle series with tons of fanservice towards the franchise as a whole. The strength of its fights as well as some of the characters were at least partially a result of Kenji Nagasaki, who would direct one of anime’s latest juggernaut series, My Hero Academia. This was followed-up not even 1 year later with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353951">
        Build Fighters Try, directed by Shinya Watada. It lacked a lot of the fun the original had thanks to rather annoying characters and significantly decreased production values. After a bunch of smaller-scale projects, the series finally came back with Gundam Build Divers, which is easily the most maligned entry to date. As such, many people were skeptical when the sequel, Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise came in. It completely abandoned the tween cast in favor of older teens, followed up the most disliked Build entry, and didn’t even have Studio Sunrise as one of the animation studios behind it as Asatsu DK and Sunrise Beyond aka an assimilated Xebec took the reigns. The early episodes didn’t do it many favors either, especially when it was only listed to be 1-cour compared to the other 3 entries that had a full 25-episode runtime. <br />
<br />
However, this isn’t the story of how the Build series died, or even the story of another middling entry in a decaying timeline in the Gundam franchise. Towards the end of the first season, viewers were hit with a proverbial colony crash as they found themselves witnessing a dramatic increase in narrative stakes, and actual character development paying off as flawed people came into their own. What seemed to be another lackadaisical or frustrating entry in the VRMMO half of the Build canon found itself announcing its second half which would be filled to the brim with payoffs after the last 2 episodes of season 1 turned the entire show on its head, throwing the audience and characters alike for a world-shattering loop. It seemed as if Shinya Watada and his staff took a lot of the criticism of Divers to heart, taking strides to improve as a director and hiring Masayuki Mutou, the man behind Gundam Unicorn --and Bible Black-- to write. Not only is it the best entry Mutou wrote for Gundam, but this series is arguably the strongest entry in the Build timeline since Fighters.<br />
<br />
Still, it’s not like the show starts off on its strongest foot. For one, Re:Rise is inherently shackled by Divers as a sequel, meaning that some of the hokey concepts such as some of the ruminating dead AI love interest characters do, are here. It also requires knowledge of Divers and the later conflicts in order to understand certain elements present. The first season also has some baffling flashback usage, as they’re often thrown in redundantly in the same episode as to what they’re flashing back to or are just thrown in during inopportune times. Some of the characters come off as frustratingly stupid and incompetent, particularly the prideful wannabe leader Kazami and the newbie of the group, Parvis. The other main leads, Hiroto and May, come off as boringly stoic early on as well with only hints of interesting characteristics being planted like seeds such as Hiroto still recoiling from the death of someone from his vague past that made him damn near quit altogether before becoming a solo player. It’s hard to root for this band of bumbling misfits at first. However, 6 episodes in, the flaws of some of these characters get put through a microscope as Kazami is broken down completely by his own arrogance and tryhard nature while Parviz’s inexperience and fear of flights and danger jeopardize the group’s ability to even remain a team when they’re on a “secret mission” to save the secret planet of Eldora from an evil army. Not only are they forced to begin improving when fully confronted with their flaws, but the static arcs of May and Hiroto actually flesh them out as Hiroto learns to work together with his team, accepting them as friends and comrades while May finds a genuine purpose for herself beyond vague missions. Then they fail so spectacularly that we’re practically reset to square one before we learn about everyone’s real-life selves and why most of them were reduced to such flawed people in the first place.<br />
<br />
One of the few elements anyone seemed to find interesting about the original Divers is when the characters get to meet in real life after their online personas formed a bond over the course of 25 episodes. Re:Rise initially has the main lead, Hiroto, be surrounded by his childhood friend, Hinata, and his endearing parents. While they come off as token nice characters at first, some of their scenes are genuinely impactful, such as when his dad, Osamu, tells him the struggles and value of coming up with a story that can mean either a fun time or the world to people. He even relates to his son’s struggles, comparing rebooting a disastrous flop to Hiroto coming back to GBN after someone he cared about died and later he and his team fucked up so tremendously hard that they almost considered pretending like the war they’ve found themselves in wasn’t their problem anymore. Kazami almost went back to simple sea life as someone who is a far cry from the utter chad he built his persona to be. Parviz nearly went back to being shackled to the ground, giving up on a hobby that let him escape and slowly begin to return to the skies he once soared. Hiroto nearly went back to just being a stoic recluse shutting himself off from his hobbies and anything that brought him joy again. Sure, May could always continue her mission by herself, but she wouldn’t grow as a person either or get very far in her quest.<br />
<br />
It is exceptionally difficult to spoil the mid-series twist or any of the arcs and subplots that make the show really come into its own as the characters develop while forming genuinely engaging dynamics. However, amidst the inevitable return of the Divers cast for some more character-building and unexpected charm. Inevitably, Hiroto’s regular life gets fleshed out as his friend, Hinata, gets tied into a subplot regarding her club leader’s comatose brother before learning just what Hiroto’s going through now that GBN slowly starts letting some darker characteristics seep through with real-world consequences. Even the NPCs of Eldora have their own engaging character dynamics and subplots, such as the slow-burn of a friendship Kazami shares with Maiya, the older sister of Frieddie aka the one who brought everyone to this quest. Deaths in the family over the course of the conflict between the village --and the world for that matter-- and the one-eyed mechs who hunt them out for reasons they neither know in the beginning or understand once they find out cause characters such as the hotheaded action-seeker Stola to realize the value of holding down the fort. Said antagonistic motivations come from Alius, an ancient being from the past who wants to “protect the world” despite tragically and blatantly losing sight of said purpose as he attacks the woodland inhabitants who look nothing like him or those who left him with his task a long time ago. Then, when the narrative finally wraps up in a series of great battles and a surprisingly solid rendition of the typical “war is bred from each side failing to understand each other so effort must be put to expand everyone’s narrow-mind viewpoints” unfolds, the results are so much more satisfying than the beginning of the show could have ever prepared anyone for.<br />
<br />
Even in terms of visuals, Re:Rise is an improvement. Overall, it’s not much to write home about as some of the background textures can feel awkward to the point of feeling like CGI environments despite the show apparently having no 3D CGI to speak of according to the show’s “Behind the Creation” video. The Build art style was never the most appealing either despite the character designs being a bit more interesting than previous installments. Some of the action scenes can feel stilted as well. However, whenever a fight scene is good, the attention to detail and sheer spectacle pulled off really sell it. This is most apparent in season 2 episode 5 when the teamwork the main leads develop culminates in one of the most tactical battles in the entire franchise. Some of the animation flourishes in later battles also feel interesting and stylized compared to the fight scenes in Try and Divers, such as when a corrupted Gundam goes full Tetsuo from Akira. If that wasn’t enough, the final battles in the series make for some of the biggest animation spectacles of 2020. Some of this is probably a result of Masami Oobari’s action direction. It also helps that even in a cast of characters who make alterations to their Gunpla over time, the main lead, Hiroto, constantly shakes things up with his core change mechanic allowing his gunpla’s design and combat to adapt to any given situation. It all really helps both seasons not only look decent, but better as they progress with some of the best fights in the Build timeline.<br />
<br />
The music is also rather solid. While the season 1 OP and ED are fine enough, it’s the season 2 songs that really stand out. “HATENA” by PENGUIN RESEARCH is a bombastic track with more hype than most shounen OPs, while “Twinkle” by Spira Spica is a surprisingly heartwarming track to end off with every week with as the credits seep into the final scene of each episode barring episode 20. Hideakira Kimura’s OST is also fairly decent as well, with special props going out to the ominous guitar piece at the end of episode 15 and the triumphant piece that plays at the end of episode 14 among other occasions. It’s not especially remarkable outside of a few tracks, but along with what got brought over from Divers and its OST, the music in this show is still solid overall.<br />
<br />
When uploading episodes of Divers and both seasons of Re:Rise to the GundamInfo Youtube channel, Shinya Watada and his team got to see the reception to each episode unfold in real-time, internalizing the feedback and speculation during production. This likely served everyone well when reflecting on where to go and what to improve on following Divers, as well as how they were going to pay everything off in the second season of this split-cour production. Perhaps this was one of the main factors that led to this show being as good as it was, provided that you get past the plodding and frustrating first 5 episodes. While it is intrinsically tied to Divers and all of its faults, the show manages to incorporate some of its predecessor’s strengths as the casts of both series came together. Not only did they come together, so did fans and critics of Divers alike. Every week, the score of Re:Rise season 2 would rise significantly as fans began to take notice that the show was far more interesting than its 2018 predecessor. Many would ask if they had to watch Divers or anything else just so they could get to Re:Rise following the staggering uphill reception the show started getting around the time the first season started coming to a close. Some still say that the Build series peaked at Fighters, but that doesn’t mean that Re:Rise was a total wash for several who found themselves disappointed with everything in between the 2013/14 and 2019/20 offerings. While the timeline would continue to be commercially successful as Gunpla kits related to it flew off the shelves, it’s safe to say this is the most excited fans have been in years. This is the story of how Shinya Watada and his team turned everything around after all these years. This is the story of how Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise brought new life to the Build canon as the best installment yet.

    Season 2 has been a season of payoffs. Everything that was referenced to in season 1 has come full circle whether it be the characters or the plot.<br />
<br />
My favorite part was seeing how each and every character developed from the bland archetypes to well-defined people that you can relate to. Each of them has something driving their actions. The main villain Alus got the most compelling development towards the end. I also liked how the team&#039;s bond developed from barely working together to comrades to a real team from season 1 till the end. Their reason for fighting to protect Eldora also had deep meaning.<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353969">
        plot also did justice to Gunpla&#039;s theme of becoming the best you that you can be and Gundam&#039;s theme of trying to resisting an oppressive force while trying to reach an understanding with them.<br />
<br />
The animation is okay. I don&#039;t know why but I find people smiling in Build Divers a bit weird. But the soundtrack does really well to build an impact with every scene.<br />
<br />
Overall, I believe that you&#039;ve got to give this series a try.

    Second season is surprisingly good for me. I didn&#039;t expect anything from the Re:Rise series when I am getting into season 1. Until the final episode of season 1, it suddenly wake me up for a little bit and realized that I may get into a good season 2.<br />
<br />
The story is plainly simple but effective. The story revolved around the fighting of the one eye, protecting the village, backstories of the characters and Eldora, and the practice and improvement of the main character&#039;s Gunpla. The story didn&#039;t feel illogical and dumb most of the time. The story developed the dull character into interesting character which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353983">
        made the audience invested into the character of the Re:rise season 2 without knowing when.   <br />
<br />
Season 2 slowly developed our flawed main characters from the ground up. We get to know Hiroto&#039;s emotional backstory and how he tried to become a better person and better team player throughout the series. May is a character who is lack of knowledge of human emotion. She was trying to learn human emotion throughout the mission against the one eye and slowly learn them by interacting the main characters. A good small detail to note is she learned to empathize with villain which showed villain is not evil because he wanted to. The villain cannot be forgiven for his action but there are some room for empathizing for him. Parviz was developed into a weaker character to a stronger character in season 1. In season 2, he is the same character but we get to know his motivation after we get to know his backstory. Kazami was childish and immature in season 1. After the final episode, he reflected his action in season 1 and developed into a &quot;chad&quot; and the leader of the team. He was reckless and was trying to be the &quot;carry&quot; in season 1 (which he was probably most useless person in the team) but his fighting style changed to be defensive and protective in season 2 which he knows he has to become shield for his team and the people of Eldora. As you can see, season 2 developed their main character quite a bit. It feels good to see your dull main character in season 1 changed into more interesting character in season 2. <br />
<br />
The art of the series has been improved compared from season 1 to season 2. The fighting scenes improved a lot compared to season 1. The strategies and teamwork of the build diver were good (also comparing a lot of Isekai series and other build series). The fighting scenes reminded me a lot from mind games in the game Overwatch which is a fps and team based shooter. For example, the one of the fight scenes in the season 2 involving a bait and switch mind games. The main character are scouting the enemy position and were hiding until they find that target. For spoiler reason, I don&#039;t want to tell what happened throughout the fight in detail. At the end, the main characters managed to use their bait to bait out the enemy positioning and won after that. I still think there are a little bit room for improvement for the fight scenes in the earlier episode for season 2. For example, transformation scenes took a long time to transform. However, the transformation scenes are way better in the later episode of the season 2. They took it even further in the final episode of the season 2. I am truly impressed with the fight scenes of the Re:rise season 2. <br />
<br />
The sound of Re:rise season 2 is good. The timing of the ost, opening and ending song in the fighting scenes and emotional scenes are perfectly synced. One of the emotional with fighting scenes in season 2 literally made me crying over the awesomeness and emotional weight of the scene. I don&#039;t think ost are amazingly good but it is okay. The opening in season 2 is bombastic and full of emotion. It can seriously get you hype up when you listen to it. The ending song is equally as good as the opening. It literally can be used with the happy, sad or wholesome final scenes of the episode and it can still work. Overall, the use of sound in season 2 is very good.<br />
<br />
I really love the season 2 of Re:rise. All aspect of the series has been upgraded significantly compared to season 1. The emotional scenes, fighting scenes, the character writing are all amazing on their own right. The use of Hiroto&#039;s different planet armor are creative and entertaining to watch. The upgrade of Kazami&#039;s Gundam reflected his character development which he didn&#039;t charge in blindly anymore in season 2. The mixed of defensive and offensive use of his gunpla reminded me of myself as a main tank in Overwatch. May&#039;s gunpla has a mixed of tank and agility on her build. It seriously reminded me of dva in Overwatch. Parviz&#039;s Gunpla is a mix of speed and attack which has like a hit and run tactic behind his build. In season 2, all main character are developed and their upgrade on Gunpla literally showed their development throughout the series. None of the main character feel useless during the fight and it is awesome to see that they come that far in terms of teamwork and the improved use of their Gunpla. <br />

    Review might be trash and forgive for my bad writing. I&#039;m gonna keep this short, not really much to talk about as its not that deep. But that doesnt mean its not enjoyable. I came into ReRise with very very low expectations coming after the original Build Divers. Although ReRise is not special in any way, it was damn enjoyable to follow along. Minor Spoilers Ahead if you havent seen season 1 of ReRise<br />
<br />
Story: 7 <br />
The Story was not anything special, but it was the execution that really helped pulled its weight. Now after the reveal in season 1, every action in the show had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353970">
        more weight and consequences to it and a lot of nice fan service. They managed to add even more backstory into the events that unfolded in the original Build Divers, which is saying a lot. The writers treated everything with a sense of reality. Although the pacing was sometimes a bit off but understandable, as some episodes are literally just there to prepare whats is to happen in the next episode. But it works here, cause it just wouldn&#039;t make sense for the main characters to suddenly be pros and defeat Alus. Thankfully no filler episodes as the plot just kept on going. The characters needed time to prepare and develop themselves and their team. They were moments that were actually enjoyable and didnt make me roll my eyes. The ending was how a ending should be, it wrapped everything up, felt satisfying and made me kinda want more. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
The animation budget was muchhh better than the previous season, not great but better. However I could see inconsistencies throughout the season, I could actually notice when certain scenes were given more attention to detail than others. There were a lot more better fight scenes this season, albeit not great but better. Gundams still look nice when not in motion. So yea almost the same, but better.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
The use of their tracks were much better implemented this season. Especially moments where they played the OP during a scene, and damn it gets moment flowing. Speaking of which, they did a lot of that this season, they used up their OP and ED time to have more showtime, which I appreciate. The tracks were not Sawano level, but it was good and I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Character : 8<br />
Boy this was the thing the original build divers needed the most, and ReRise paid off with its characters. All of the characters completed their character arcs from beginning to end. They&#039;re not the best, but a hell of a lot better than the Original BD. They dont suddenly get insanely Overpowered when they think about friendship, instead they feel the weight of a world in their shoulders which is wayyyyy better. At then end, they&#039;re not like crazy individual who could defeat the GBN Champ, but they show them that as a team they could accomplish feats with skill and strategy. Each of them evetually have roles, Hiroto as the Ace, May as the support/tech, Kazami as the Tank and Par as the rogue. Hiroto was much more likable than Riku, May was more likable than Serah, Hell even Eve was better than Serah. Again, if you noticed everything is just better than Build Divers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 9<br />
I&#039;m a Gundam fan, I see a gunpla kit,I buy it. So my opinion for this section is a bit bias. Coming after the disaster that was Build Divers, I expected this to be garbage. Yet when I followed along with the series, it just surprised me again and again. You know when ReRise is better when the worst parts of some episodes were flashbacks of Riku lmao. Ironically, if Build Divers wasn&#039;t as bad as it was, I wouldn&#039;t have enjoyed ReRise this much. The thing that kept surprising me was how freaking better it was than Build Divers. It was a very enjoyable experience. and Yo (SPOILERS) that moment where they combined all combined was crazy, like in my mind was like &quot;those crazy people at Sunrise actually did it, THEY COMBINED&quot;. They somehow combined 4 mobile suits that nbody thought was possible, into one Power rangers Megazord. This was the stuff that kept me invested in the show.<br />
<br />
Overall : 8 <br />
Honestly it should be given a 7, but I would be doing a disservice to the people at Sunrise who put the effort into making this show A LOT better than the original Build Divers. I mean they literally salvaged the scraps that was Build Divers and gave it new life. All in all it is just a much muchhh better show than Build Divers and it is a treat to watch a show that you damn well know was gonna be trash turn out to be one of the shows you looked forward to every week. With all that said, in order to really enjoy this, you have to watch Build Divers. This show wont have the same appeal for people who just started here instead or didnt have low expectations for it. But as a Gundam Fan, it was a damn nice show and I&#039;m happy to have watched it.

    Positive comments to say about Re:Rise usually start by saying it’s not the predecessor. Better animation, less annoying shounen tropes with bare minimum execution. More interesting characters and a better story. After Diver’s obvious bomb, it’s not hard for people to adjust to thinking that anything that lightly tries to be better, to be better. There is not much to expect from the sequel of a blatant low-effort advert. Though go back eight years and there is the progenitor of the “Build Gundam” series line, where claiming Re:Rise a superior show would be a hard sell.<br />
<br />
Episodes 13 and half of 14 are recaps, 19 &amp;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353949">
        20 are flashback episodes and 24 is mainly fanservice cameos, which leaves seven episodes to work on the present. Half of those seven episodes are spent in exposition mode; characters talking about the current situation, their alleged strategy, how they got to where they are, and what exactly is the world/the people in it. While intriguing to the people interested, there ends up being a distinct lack of character development outside of the four main characters. Retcons to the previous show are made to shove in this one with seemingly no other reason than to tie them more closer together. Everything has to be revealed in these twelve episodes after the twist, but the room for the actual build up is missing. If there was more clarity and proper characterization in season one, perhaps they’d be able to go without explaining everything. Unfortunately, you can see poor execution plainly in how the final episode has no gravity, no real consequences or stakes. While the climax an episode before is a fun fight to watch, there was such bare-bones build up that you’d expect that they would’ve pushed this back to a third season. Then they could’ve bumped the incident before with more than minimal build-up, though most lack of build-up/characterization could be attributed to brainwashing. For the grandiose ideas it has, Re:Rise tends to only talk about them and only give a glance into its depth. Leading to shallow heel-face turns that are forecasted only an episode or two before, and much of the tension coming off superficial<br />
<br />
Characters have their life’s history constantly info-dumped upon because their personality wasn’t built on enough. One of the main characters barely develops outside of season one’s plot twist. And despite the two episodes of flashbacks, there is still sparse characterization of the protagonist&#039;s fridge to warrant much care about his grief; a bit too late more than three quarters into the show too. Which leaves a standard cliche and the comic relief to provide most of the personality. One’s fine, the other’s almost as grating as Riku in how low effort the personality is. With how they bottle-necked themselves, there’s three separate settings in which only the main four can freely interact in all, and it lies on those four to carry most of the screen-time. There’s a saturation in unnecessary side characters that can’t contribute to the main story, yet still take up screen-time anyway, to the point where that leaves more important side characters few minutes to actually develop them through show, rather than tell. This failure leads to a disconnect to the conflict. The major incident in the first season is a big example of that.  <br />
<br />
What both Re:Rise and Build Divers seem to understand from the original is the crazy backdrop of Reiji and his home-world, the zany gunpla mafia backdrop. Ignoring the fact that it wasn’t the main story. They both introduce “serious” ideas/analogies like AI sentience, drugs, moving on, aliens,-leaning more towards an isekai plot than Build Fighters, much less Gundam. It personally bothers me more that Re:Rise decided to double down on having “deep” themes to distance itself from the dumb shounen core of Divers. And there’s no side characters that do much to liven up the scenery either, the Eldoran’s more irritating it by mimicking the kids in 0079 and Zeta. I’d prefer another proxy battle shounen about learning to love paying Bandai money and fan-service, but these seem to focus on pandering to the mainstream audiences, Isekai being/was in vogue. <br />
<br />
The music is pretty alright: the composer seems to be new, but talented. With Masami Obari supposedly helping with the animation it’s a vast improvement over Build Divers. The gunpla has a neat gimmick and there’s usually a fight every episode. Perhaps excusable as brain-dead entertainment, it would then seem that brain-dead entertainment has downgraded in quality. Though gunpla sales are probably going to make this series a success in the eyes of Bandai. Watch the original Build Fighters, or some other toys to life anime(I’ve heard Medabots is good). Buy the kits if you like their looks and skip the series. If this is the type of script the scriptwriter for Hathaway’s Flash makes, it kills my excitement for it. <br />

    An unforgettable journey, thank you for making 2020 that much more bearable. <br />
<br />
Before we start, I&#039;m going to say that there will be spoilers for the entire show, so TLDR: its a very enjoyable show and a really good sequel, would definitely recommend it. Now that&#039;s out of the way, let&#039;s get to the review.<br />
<br />
When gundam build divers re:rise was first announced to be a sequel to the infamously bad gundam build divers, poeple (including myself) just assumed sunrise would pump out another show just to milk the build divers franchise and release a lackluster, space magic opera. However, re:rise, to my surpise, not only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353989">
        avoids the avoided the same mistakes of its predecessor, but also shines as an excellent sequel. <br />
<br />
To start, let&#039;s recall how many good gundam sequels are actually out there, the answer is: not that much. The most similar gundam sequel that I can compare is gundam build fighters try, the sequel to the beloved gundam build fighters. <br />
<br />
One thing re:rise does right was to link Hirito&#039;s tragic backstory to the final battle of build divers, asking the audience, what if there were other EL-divers than Sarah? Did they survive the final battle? To answer this question, an EL-diver named Eve was written. Eve was a friend of Hirotos, she helped him along Hirotos journey in GBN, from tuning the core gundam, to expanding Hirotos vision of having inter-changeable armor parts for the core gundam, thus the birth of the planetary armor system. At first glance, the core gundam armors feel like another effort from bandai to grab more money, however, we later learn that the names of the armors were based on Eve&#039;s desire to explore the known universe of GBN, which was really brillant and added chemistry between the two characters. But, just as you have bought the chemistry between Hiroto and Eve, we all know what happens next- tradgety. Eve, sacrificing herself to save Sarah, ultimately asks Hirito to erase her, asking the only person dearest to her, to do the one thing that neither of them wants to do. This gave Hiroto PTSD, and a fear of intimacy with other people, as his memories of Eve still haunt him as the story progresses. <br />
<br />
Aside from that, re:rise also attempts to explain how the EL-divers were born and links the explaination to one of the key plotpoints- Eldora. I won&#039;t delve too much into the details, otherwise it would absolutely spoil the ending, but I found that to be decent world-building as any good sequel should. <br />
<br />
Now to the best parts of the show, the characters. Like build fighters try, re:rise also plays around with the concept of team work, where 2 or more people work together for a common goal. However, the teamwork in re:rise was done leagues above what try did. The development of the re:rise team wass directly affected by character developments, thus you could really see how a character has developed based on his/her performance during teamplay. One core requirement for good writing, is to show the struggles and insecurities of your characters. At first, the re:rise team was discoordinated, as you would expect from a rag-tag team of random players. Hirito and May, being emotionally withdrawn, carried the team on their backs, even though Hiroto doesn&#039;t want to at times. Par, having a trauma from a life-altering accident, was afraid to step out of his comfort zone and often wasted his gunpla&#039;s potential by only sticking to the ground. And Kazami, being one of those players that talked more but didn&#039;t had the skill to back it up. He was self-centered, always wanted to look cool, while refusing to depend on his teammates. At first, this was determental to their teamwork. They got their asses kicked alot.<br />
<br />
However, as they overcome their insecurities and helped each other, their characters started growing. Hiroto, faced with the PTSD-inducing dillemma of shooting down Riku, whose girl was the reason for Eve&#039;s death; even though it went against Eve&#039;s final wish of hoping Hiroto to be a person who helps others, breaksdown when confronting his PTSD again. With comforts from his team, May being grateful for his choice to allow EL-divers to exist; Freddy thanking him for his help towards the Eldorans. Learns to let go of his grief and began to pursue his new goal of helping out the people of Eldora. <br />
<br />
Kazami, on the otherhand, realized that his ignorance cost the lives of many Eldorans, found a new reason to fight: protecting the people of Eldora from extermination. His character even progresses as he asks Hiroto for advice on transforming gunpla parts, his gunpla even progressed along with his role in the team as a tank. From the worst player, to a reliable, steadfast tank; all because of his desire to protect the people of Eldora. <br />
<br />
Par, lets go of his trauma and steps away from his comfort zone, explores the possibilities of his gunpla and improves significantly as a player. He also overcame his shyness towards people and even uses his knowledge of gunpla to rebuild the broken wings of the Sacred Beast. All because he too knew what it was like to not be able to fly. <br />
<br />
May, being an EL-diver whom expressed little human emotions, turned out being the first person to comfort a crying Hiroto, and even learning that people could also shed tears of happiness towards the end of the show. Her obbession towards fixing Alus, the rogue AI whose duty was to &quot;protect&quot; the planet against all Eldorans, stems from her EL-diver background and her hope that Alus can look past his rigid goal with love and compassion, two pillars of human emotion. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s almost poetic in how the show handles its character development, but more importantly, its how much effort and heart was poured into the show. The writer secretly included Hirotos&#039; father as the voice of the writer, while showing the audience, through Hiroto&#039;s chat with his father, on the insecurities of the writer as well. This shows how much care went into the show and elevates the enjoyment I had. <br />
<br />
Speaking of enjoyment, the battles in the first half of the show were ok. It&#039;s the fights in thew second half season were things get interesting. We have creative take downs left and right, together with improved teamwork amongst the re:rise team, communicating with one another, planning and pulling off combo moves; pooling their resources together towards a common goal. They even scheduled real-life meetings and became a very efficient team. Unlike build fighters try, where team battles boil down to battle royal free for alls between the lame rivals, as well as screams and lack of build up. Re:rise also featured some of the most engaging fights that I have seen in a while. The first being Masaki&#039;s resue, with his life being at stake; another favorite being the come-back of the re:rise team against Alus for a final showdown; where there were instances of strategies being made, with help from the cast of the original build divers. Another being the battle between Hiroto&#039;s uraven gundam against Alus, showcasing Alus bastardizing Hiroto&#039;s perfect self as the man who almost shot down the wishes of his dying girlfriend.  These battles had build up, clever utilization of team strategies, as well as satisfying conclusions, none of which try had. <br />
<br />
On top of good fights, the animation was also good at times. You can notice a pattern of the creators alternating between releasing episodes with little fights, followed by episodes with action. This pattern ensured good pacing, while keeping the lighter episodes focused on character growth and exposition. There was also little recycled animation being used, being the transformation sequences of the core gundam, while try was plagued with recycled animation from it&#039;s main character, Sekai, whom had a special move consisting of cramming all of his moves together into one, whilst recycling the animation of all his moves. Some fights form re:rise, I dare say, surpass the fights of its predecessor in terms of animation quality.<br />
<br />
As for sound. I really need to praise the voice acting of the main characters. Hiroto, having gone through a roller coaster of emotions in the series, was cast by a releatively new VA. However, the most I need to praise was Hinata&#039;s VA, who, despite also being new, shown a vast range of emtions and tones that made my ears pregnant. It was that good. <br />
<br />
Overall, I really enjoyed re:rise, it showcases what try should have been: with good teamwork, solid character development and engaging fights. It also tied up loose ends from its predecessor masterfully, while keeping it&#039;s setting unique and never insults its audience with space magic. Its self-aware, wholesome and enjoyable. <br />
<br />

    Characters are ok. but kazami and parv were are far the least interesting characters. freddie is annoying<br />
<br />
alus is basically a stubborn boomer AI. His motivation is so hilarious that you may not feel for him. (some people feel for him but imo he&#039;s not worth feeling sorry for)<br />
<br />
The end was pretty rushed. Directing of the show was off cuz some cut-in scenes were unnecessary. For example hinata&#039;s arrow ceremony for the prayer of hope killed the entire re:rising scene although re:rising has a bad lower body itself. <br />
<br />
All I can say is try, divers and re:rise failed to exceed OG build fighters.

    It’s amazing how this serie improved after that bland first part and that dreadful first season. But what did this serie do to get better in such a way? Simple and straightforward: it started to raise the stakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
First part ended up with a plot twist: Eldora was a real world, instead of a GBN part, so everything the characters went through was real. Now they have actual reasons to go back and fight, making the main issue as a real threat and changing the mood to a more serious one; but before, they have to overcome their insecurities. This Build serie differs from the rest

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354022">
        in that it is more focused on characters and plot, so raising the stakes was a big bet that could go wrong in many ways. Fortunately, this was not the case: <br />
<br />
First, Eldora NPCs, represented by Freddie, acknowledged the big problem they were into after that catastrophic attack that wiped out a reasonable part of them. Even when they weren’t fully aware of who is behind this rampage and why, they decided to raise and prove they deserve to live in this planet instead of feel sorry, getting some sort of “humanity”.<br />
<br />
But characters got the spotlight here. First part did a shallow development attempt by throwing out random flashbacks with little to zero context and called it a day. Here, characters were broken down after facing the reality of being in an actual planet trying to help real people, forced to fight against their demons:<br />
<br />
-Hiroto, who started as a boring stoic guy with no apparent motivations, got fleshed out not only as a GBN player, but also in real life by her childhood friend. Hinata described him as someone who likes to help others, but after losing someone special for him in GBN, he lost any motivation. He went through this “secret mission” almost by inertia, but after discover the truth and facing his past, where he swore to protect the world his special person loved, he found the courage of fighting for others, alongside a group of people that share his goal, people that now he can call comrades. Hiroto grew up as a better person thanks to his friend and family in real life, and his comrades in GBN, which whom he formed bonds in real world as well, allowing him to learn to work together.<br />
<br />
-Kazami got the biggest perspective change, starting as your typical noisy, arrogant blockhead guy, putting his pride over his common sense. Kazami thought being a hero was just about showing off, and after acknowledging his own weaknesses when he was unable to save real people, he realized the true value of a hero; this got represented by changing his playstyle to a more defensive one, and prioritizing shield usage. Kazami went from the most infuriating character to the most relatable one.<br />
<br />
-Parviz resorted to GBN as an escape from the reality, where he was doomed not to be able to enjoy what he loved: flights, because of an accident. Not only that, but now he was invaded by fear, fear that also fed his inexperience in GBN, fear that resurfaced again after discover the truth about Eldora. Parviz was afraid to come back, afraid of falling down again, but he put his own fear under Eldora people’s who were struggling to survive, yet never gave up. He somehow found the courage of flying again.<br />
<br />
-May was the simplest one, but not in a bad way. As an EL-Diver, her only purpose was to look after GBN safety; similar to Hiroto, she got involved almost by inertia, but she took this role more seriously than the rest, even was willing to go on alone, but she got a real reason by meeting Alus, the main antagonist, who, pretty much like her, is an artificial being created with a purpose, but after losing said purpose, he lost his way. May took this personal, so she was aiming for “saving” him. For the first time, she wanted to do something by own and pure will, instead of a sense of duty. Of course, she wouldn’t be able to accomplish it by herself, that’s why she started to concern about forming bonds with the rest of the group. At the end, May achieved to develop a sign of humanity.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Not only each of them improved individually, but as a team too. By sharing a common goal, they improved as GBN fighters for the sake of others, and this is portrayed in their constant alterations to their Gunplas and playstyles over time: Hiroto started to concern more about teamwork than do it all himself, and adapted his Gunpla’s armors for that; Kazami started to focus on a solid defense and more strategy, instead of just showing off; and Parviz lost his fear to flying and reconnected his bond with “Morgiana” -his Gunpla-; May also started to resort to her Mobile Doll form when needed. Also, how they went over the GBN boundaries to meeting in real life gave more weight to the group dynamic, and settled the importance this “mission” has for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that being said, the fact this serie was more focused on this serious approach doesn’t mean the action part was set apart. In fact, battles were one of the most well-done aspects. Not only because of the strategic component most battles had, who also showed how well the team dynamic was fleshed out, but also the narrative weight and meaning; every battle had a background implication that cemented their importance. This aspect was never done so well since the first Build Fighters serie. Also, having a full hand-drawn mechanical battle is always a good bonus! Soundtrack adds up to this as well, though is not as memorable as Yuuki Hayashi’s work in the first two Build Fighters series, it is good enough to hit on point when needed, thanks to a good sound direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s a shame than can’t be told that, as a whole, Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise was a really outstanding experience, because of that first part that, looking in hindsight, worked as a base of a good development; and still lacked of some Heart and energy, compared to the first Build Fighter serie. Even so, Re:Rise 2nd Season could live up to expectations, evidencing that improvement is possible, and raising the flag in the Build franchise to keep it up alive.<br />

    Although its still a pretty standard and uninspiring plot, this second series has done enough to rescue Re:Rise from being an absolute write-off for me. We actually see some background and context to the protagonists. It isn&#039;t amazing but at least gave them some relatability. The plot surrounding GBN and Eldora became interesting enough to keep me watching until the end, and some of the call backs to the original Divers series later in the series were nice. I still think it took way too long to get there after the awful first season of Re:Rise, and think there are plenty of other better Gundam
