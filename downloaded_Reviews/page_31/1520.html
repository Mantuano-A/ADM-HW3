    I&#039;ll try to get straight to the point with this review.  Before watching this series I had never read the manga nor had I ever seen anything about it beyond the wiki page for the show.  I thought it looked decent so I began watching.<br />
<br />
The anime had a very promising first episode and the characters seems well thought out and reasonably likable.  I found it entertaining and continued onward.<br />
<br />
It goes all downhill from there.  The plot starts out strong and then begins failing very quickly.  There is a massive amount of what I would claim is filler and you really

        cannot see much progression at all in the story throughout the entire 1st and 2nd series.  (I just found out that the third was canceled &amp;gt;_&amp;lt;)<br />
<br />
Basically you could skip episodes 10-47 ish and still know whats going on.  The part that really got to me was how often they would play a song while slowly moving frames across the screen to take up time during an episode.  I know what the characters faces look like and I don&#039;t need to see close ups of them doing nothing for 10 minutes every episode.  They never even bothered to come up with new songs, just replayed them.<br />
<br />
If you can sit through 52 episodes of sameness and you enjoy that feel free to watch.  I have nothing against the characters or the idea behind the show.  It just seems to me that they never went anywhere with it.  Maybe the manga is better, I wouldn&#039;t know.  Hope this review is helpful and not seen as a hate thread.

    Tsubasa RESERVoir Chronicle (TRC) - the anime - showed a lot of promise from its very first episode.  However, because of the fact that TRC is aired during the children\&#039;s hour in Japan, which limits exactly the kind of content they are allowed to put into this anime, as a result, have disappointed many viewers thinking they would be witnessing a story that was close to what was written in the manga by CLAMP.  However, despite all of that, Tsubasa Chronicle still shapes up to be a relatively enjoying series, if you can get through a couple of the more slower arcs and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339">
        horrendous fillers.<br />
<br />
First of, in case you did not know, CLAMP decided to \&amp;quot;recycle\&amp;quot; a lot of its characters from Card Captor Sakura and other anime in this show.  In essence, you will see a ton of familiar faces, but that\&#039;s all they are - faces.  For the most part they have completely different personalities and histories.  I don\&#039;t know if that\&#039;s because they ran out of ideas for completely new characters or not, but that\&#039;s just the way it is.  But don\&#039;t get me wrong, it\&#039;s definitely not a bad thing.  <br />
<br />
The animation, as usual from CLAMP, is up to par with today\&#039;s standards and what today\&#039;s viewers expect from an anime.  It\&#039;s very crisp and clean and very colorful.  The relationship between Sakura and Syaoran is something you could shed a tear witnessing the trials they go through, but once again, the slowness of it all prevents a continuous enjoyment of that.<br />
<br />
Yuki Kaijura has once again put together a very beautiful soundtrack to go along with this anime.  From the very first time the piece named \&amp;quot;A song of storm and fire\&amp;quot; is played with the anime, that alone will urge you to keep watching this anime.  However, this anime does progress extremely slowly at times, especially after the first arc and the fillers (you wouldn\&#039;t think there would be fillers in a 26-episode season, but there are) are extremely boring, possibly with the exception of one or two filler arcs.<br />
<br />
Even with all of that, its the animation and music that keeps Tsubasa RESERVoir Chronicles - the anime - alive and what keeps its viewers, in my mind anyway.  The story has the potential (well, it does if you read the manga) to be amazing, but the fillers and slow progress prevent it from doing so.  If you want to know what happens, pick up the manga and start reading it.  You won\&#039;t be disappointed.  The anime is something you have to be patient with.

    I will be firm in saying that nobody, NOT ONE OF YOU would have given this anime the time of day if it hadn&#039;t recycled characters from better anime. <br />
<br />
CLAMP, in a move of sweeping lack of creativity, decided to make another franchise by reusing their old characters. I gotta say, smart move, CLAMP--your cash cow is ready to be chopped up and sold. <br />
<br />
And this is what Tsubasa Chronicle is: a sell-out. <br />
<br />
The story is bland and boring. Dimension-travellers bound together for whatever reasons, but you know, viewers won&#039;t care because they get to see Sakura and Shaoran or whatever his name is go

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8997">
        gaga over one another once again and two yaoi-fodder guys vacillate between passion and disgust of one another. <br />
<br />
The art was mediocre. It wasn&#039;t good, wasn&#039;t bad. Nothing special. Like the sound. <br />
<br />
I cannot give the characters a good rating because they aren&#039;t characters. They are just themselves from the old anime transported to a new one to serve a purpose. They aren&#039;t developed, they aren&#039;t deep, it isn&#039;t good. <br />
<br />
I was yawning and scratching a lot while watching this--that can&#039;t be good. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is unfabulous crap. Don&#039;t watch it. Unless you&#039;re a CLAMP fan and you won&#039;t listen to me.

    ***A word to the wise: You should probably only read this review if you haven&#039;t read the manga version. If you HAVE read it, and have an open mind, then my review will probably help too***<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen a few animes that have been based off of mangas [it seems like less and less anime these days are original] and it is very rare that the entire plot line will be in the anime. I was delighted with Itazura na Kiss because for the most part, it does follow the manga version very well, and the characters look the same in both anime and manga. <br />
As

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8414">
        for Tsubasa Chronicle, I have only glanced at the manga and never read it. However, I know how it is to read a manga, see the anime version, and be very disappointed. That is why I said if you have read the manga, you should probably not watch Tsubasa Chronicle, for you will be very upset. I know that it strays from it&#039;s original plot, but if you have just finished, say, Cardcaptor Sakura and want to watch the &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; thing, then I highly suggest Tsubasa Chronicle. Here is why. <br />
<br />
Story: The story follows Syaoran and Sakura from Cardcaptors, but that is all they are. Their appearances are of a teenage Syaoran and Sakura, but their personalities are in no way the same, except that Sakura is still sweet. Syaoran does not still have that awkward temper of his from Cardcaptors, so when you are watching this anime you kind of forget who their original characters were [which is a good thing, because if you didn&#039;t, you&#039;d watch the series very disappointed that Sakura isn&#039;t with Kero-chan whipping out Sakura cards with Syaoran trying to confess to her :p]. Anyway, Sakura has lost her memory through feathers that sprouted into wings out of her back, and Syaoran travels with the memory-free Sakura through different worlds to collect the feathers and return her memory. However, in exchange for being able to save her, Syaoran has to agree to let the memories of him be erased from Sakura&#039;s memory [and it is highly hinted that Sakura is in love with Syaoran, who, judging by his actions, is also in love with her]. So this time around, it is Syaoran fighting, and not Sakura. It&#039;s a good story, because traveling to different worlds is very interesting to watch. Instead of being like a normal plot line where you get a different world for every episode, they will stay in one world for around three episodes and develop characters in the other worlds, which I think is very interesting and nice, because normally anime only focuses on the central characters.<br />
<br />
Art: Some people complain about the art. It is a little quick looking because their limbs are long lines with large hands, but I actually like it. It&#039;s a nice change from the usual super-detailed Clamp because it makes the characters move a little better and it looks a little more updated. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s the best ever, but it honestly doesn&#039;t bother me. There is still a lot of super-detailed Clamp things like the clothing, magical items, etc.<br />
<br />
Sounds: The music is beautiful. It does get used a lot, the same thing over and over I mean, but all in all it&#039;s really pretty and epic. It&#039;s not something you&#039;d expect from this anime, and I like the recurring themes so much I don&#039;t mind if they get played again.<br />
<br />
Character: I personally like this Syaoran. He is a little predictable, but he is tough and fights with all of his heart to find Sakura&#039;s feathers, even though he has no motivation but to save her, since she has lost her memories of him. It is his love for her that makes him different from usual characters. He&#039;s not weak, he doesn&#039;t back down. All he needs is to look at Sakura and he is filled with the spirit to fight for her. Sakura, if you&#039;ll pardon me, reminds me greatly of Chi from Chobits when she loses her memory. If you watch the anime, you&#039;ll see what I mean. I half expected her to go &amp;quot;Chiiiiii?&amp;quot; every time she saw something like a bird or a new person. Thankfully, she doesn&#039;t go so far as to refer to herself in third person. She does, however, get the same happy, dazed looks that Chi gets, and smiles a lot which seems to turn even bad guys good. But hey, it&#039;s still Clamp after all. ;-]  Sakura and Syaoran are also joined by Fai, who is a delightfully carefree magician that is so classic with Clamp because of his easy-going nature, and Kurogane, who is a tough warrior that works together with Fai and brings a lot of the comedy to the story. Mokona from Rayearth is also there, and he is just soooooo cute. :D You will see a lot of characters from other Clamp works, but be warned: THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. They only LOOK like their original characters, but their personalities are different. Although it has to be said...Yukito and Sakura&#039;s brother from Cardcaptor sort of hint at their original characters, especially when you see them in different worlds. :D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: So far, I&#039;m enjoying it. Everyone said that I would hate it after I&#039;d seen 10 episodes, but I am on 13 and still like it. I know I&#039;ll finish it. I mean yes, a lot of time is spent panning character&#039;s faces and doing flashbacks to the previous episode at the beginning of a new one, but if you skip it and just put up with a lot of zooming in on Syaoran&#039;s face, then you&#039;ll be able to finish it too. I have to admit, it is the worst zooming-in-on-a-character-to-use-up-time I&#039;ve ever seen, but I just try to ignore it. But hey, I still look forward to each episode, so obviously it&#039;s not as big of a deal as everyone says it is.<br />
<br />
Overall: Like I said at the beginning of my long review, just watch it if you haven&#039;t read the manga. It really is a good story if you just treat it like an anime and not an anime based off of a manga. Albeit the long pauses on someone&#039;s face, the repetitive themes, and the flashbacks, I&#039;m still enjoying it. And I&#039;ve given up animes before that were far worse. So give it a shot and try to finish it. ;-]

    &quot;For all my life... I&#039;ve wanted strength. I didn&#039;t want those things precious to me to be taken away from me anymore. But, to have strength means to invite disaster to come to you. And strength alone can&#039;t really protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles... took me a while to get into it. I don&#039;t really know why, but I feel like it might have just been because of the slow start, but it also might have been because of the slightly cliché story. However, once I started paying more attention, it got more interesting with every episode. The story unfolded a little more, the characters got

          <span style="display: none;" id="review103561">
        more lovable, and the fight scenes got a lot better. So, without further ado, let&#039;s get this review started, shall we?<br />
<br />
As I previously stated, the anime had a bit of a slow start, and the story was a bit of a cliché. It&#039;s about a boy and a girl. The boy being a villager, the girl being a princess. Both have been best friends since they were children. One day, the princess and the boy spend the day together, the princess having something supposedly important to tell the boy, but is not able to. That night, an unknown magic force calls the princess, and a ritual is performed. However, the boy saves her before the ritual is completed, but she looses every single one of her memories. The kingdom&#039;s priest then teleports the two of them to the Dimensional Witch, where they are also greeted by two others meeting with her, one a swordsman, and the other a mage. The Witch then tells the boy that in order to help the princess regain her memories, they must go dimension hopping, but at a price. In order to have the power to do that, the boy must give up all of the princess&#039; memories of him. Even if they recover all of her memories, she will never remember him. He agrees, and the story is about the princess, the boy, the swordsman, and the mage as they all travel together, looking for her memories. As they go dimension hopping, they run into trouble nearly every world they visit, and help out the people of that world, involving overthrowing evil rulers, stopping a gang war, and fighting demons. Like I said, the whole &quot;Girl loosing her memory&quot; is a bit of a cliché, but their journeys together make it a lot better.<br />
<br />
I liked the artwork a lot. The anime was made by Bee Train, the studio behind Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~, Murder Princess, and the .//hack series. The artwork in Tsubasa reminded me of all of the other animes that Bee Train made, so it felt familiar to me. For those of you who have watched those other series as well, if you enjoyed them then you&#039;re going to be satisfied with the artwork of Tsubasa.<br />
<br />
I own both seasons of Tsubasa on DVD, so I own the English Dub. That means I have not seen the Sub version yet, but I thought it was fine. I liked Vic Mignogna as Fai, he was probably my favorite character. I also liked Monica Rial as Sakura, but the only problem I had with her was her singing. It must have sounded better in Japanese, but I didn&#039;t like Sakura&#039;s singing voice in the English version. Jason Liebrecht played Syaoran, and I enjoyed listening to his voice, as well as Christopher Sabat as Kurogane. Overall an interesting choice for the dub cast, but it could have been better in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Alright, now it&#039;s down to the characters. To start off, we have Syaoran, the male protagonist of Tsubasa. He&#039;s calm, collected, a really good kicker evidently, and he&#039;s willing to risk it all in order to save Sakura. Sakura is the main female protagonist, and she is kind and caring to everyone. She&#039;s the kind of girl who would be totally worth saving, unlike a few other main female protagonists in certain animes... next is Fai. Fai was, in a word, awesome. He&#039;s funny, he&#039;s smart, and he&#039;s asking for a deathwish by calling Kurogane nicknames like &quot;Kuro-poo&quot;. Speaking of Kuro-poo, he was my second favorite character in Tsubasa, just because he was so crazy angry all the time, and it makes for some pretty hilarious moments. Now, for the one character that I loath... Mokona. It probably has something to do with all of the annoying animal sidekicks in anime, but Mokona was probably the most annoying of all of them. It&#039;s the high pitched voice that makes me the most angry, but it&#039;s also how obnoxiously cute it is. Other than Mokona, I liked all of the characters.<br />
<br />
I liked this anime a lot. If it were on TV, I&#039;d watch it every week once a new episode airs. I liked it, but the slow start kind of gave me the wrong impression of it at the start, but if you want to understand the story, it&#039;s required of you to watch it from episode 1. After a few episodes though, it gets better, trust me. For those of you who enjoy animes with mostly enjoyable characters and good fight scenes, you&#039;d enjoy Tsubasa. If you can&#039;t stand slow starts and annoying animal sidekicks, then steer clear. But overall, I&#039;m liking this series so far. Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me, time to start watching Season 2.

    Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE is one of my favorite manga series. I was happy to discover that it had been made into an anime series, and after I stopped watching it after the first 16 episodes, I decided to pick it up again. I was only planning on finishing the first season, and after making my way through the last 10 episodes I needed to watch, I&#039;ve definitely been dissuaded from watching the second season and just sticking with the manga, which I will be referencing throughout this review. (No spoilers though!)<br />
<br />
Story: The story is drawn out, and the series is riddled with fillers and random

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5734">
        things that weren&#039;t true to the original manga. When it was true to the manga, it was plagued by slow pacing. Things were added that were just there to stretch out the episodes to the allotted 25 minutes, such as long pauses in conversations, flashbacks, and unnecessary, lifeless panning shots. The story itself is broken into arcs: as the main characters travel, each world they visit is its own arc, which is more or less self-contained. They&#039;re not too complex, and they all follow the same basic formula: the group lands in a world, a feather is somewhere in the world they landed in, some bad guys want the feather for themselves, fight the bad guys, move on to the next world, rinse and repeat. This persists until the end of the season, but not necessarily by fault of pacing - the manga followed the same formula up until the Tokyo arc, so it&#039;s hardly surprising that the anime followed suit.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation: The animation itself is very... lacking. Tsubasa is a beautifully drawn manga, but the anime... not so much. The proportions, especially the facial proportions in particular, are wonky. Bee Train did not do a very good job of translating CLAMP&#039;s style of manga into animation. As far as the actual movement... there isn&#039;t much of it, and when there is it&#039;s still very stiff. Scenes that should&#039;ve been dynamic weren&#039;t dynamic at all. In a word, it&#039;s underwhelming. Aside from the wonky proportions and the not-so-stellar animation, the character designs are solid. I am also fond of the color choices: generally bright, colorful, and pleasing to the eye.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is the thing about this anime that really shines. The opening is good and the ending, sung by Maaya Sakamoto, is beautiful. The background music was penned by Kajiura Yuki, and you can&#039;t go wrong with her; her music gives the series a feeling of mysticism and magic. Overall, the soundtrack is absolutely stellar. As for the voices, after reading the manga for so long, hearing the characters speak out loud was a bit jarring, but I got used to it. Yui Makino in particular does a great job as Sakura, and is an excellent spiritual successor to Sakura Tange (who voiced Sakura in the original Cardcaptor Sakura series and was not working as a voice actress at the time Tsubasa was animated). I also enjoyed Tetsu Inada as Kurogane and Daisuke Namikawa as Fai. I only watched it in Japanese so I can&#039;t speak for the English dub.<br />
<br />
Character: Call me a CLAMP fangirl, but I love it when they crossover their characters. That said, a majority of Tsubasa&#039;s character are, indeed, not original to the series. However, individually, they vary from world to world, so despite the bad impression that the phrase &quot;recycled characters&quot; leaves, there is diversity. However, with different sets of characters in each world, not much depth is given to the supporting cast. On the other hand, the main characters are well-written for what they were given. The characters&#039; backstories - particularly Kurogane&#039;s and Fai&#039;s - were never animated, so their motivations and subtleties in characterization might be a bit unclear. But for what it was, it was done well. The main cast is diverse in personality and their dynamic is very good - they work well together both as comrades and as a makeshift family. One thing that did suffer, however, is the relationship between two particular characters (who I will not name so as not to spoil). As the series goes on, it appears that the writers decided to disregard all subtleties regarding one character&#039;s romantic feelings for another character. It really takes away from their development and it gives the impression that the writers just wanted to rush it and appease the viewers with a romantic relationship rather than have it develop more slowly (and much more satisfyingly) as it did in the manga.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Lots of filler material makes this series feel very boring and stretched out. Like I said before, when two characters are having a conversation, it seems like they&#039;re going as slow as possible just to waste time. There are long pauses in between statements, even right in the middle of sentences! It made some parts very annoying to watch, and had me thinking, &quot;When will this be over?&quot; The pacing issues are a huge detriment to this series. On top of that, the fillers aren&#039;t even that interesting to watch. I was disappointed to find out that the last episode of this season is also a filler! I did, however, enjoy the Outo arc in particular. I still got some entertainment value out of watching the characters I love, but the pacing and filler dragged down my enjoyment of the show by a lot.<br />
<br />
Overall: The only things really holding this series up are the characters and the music. Everything else about it, especially the pacing and filler, is painful. CLAMP themselves disowned this adaptation of their manga. But if you&#039;re willing to tolerate the constant filler, I say go for it. However, if you&#039;d rather have your share of Tsubasa without all the filler, I recommend heading over to your local bookstore.

    Much like berryful I had no idea about this series going into it, manga or anime-wise. I had seen some Tsubasa stuff in Animate when I lived in Japan and had figured that I should watch it someday...<br />
<br />
I happened to pick up the first 3 DVDs from my library and what I learned about this anime is that its totally not worth the time. I&#039;m not sure what year this was anime-converted from manga but the way they did the anime compared to the manga (from what I&#039;ve read) was the real killer. <br />
<br />
The first few episodes seem interesting, character presentation and all, and then

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10099">
        suddenly were thrown into the storyline. Suddenly were introduced to four different worlds and three new characters (one of which is nameless and seems to be the main antagonist, monocle and beard and all). <br />
<br />
The show then goes into a pokemon-esque/duel monsters/digimon etc world where characters are completely devoid of development. Suddenly the seemingly wussy main character becomes a formidable fighter and all other characters throw in their two cents etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I watched processed shows from FUNIMATION (you suck) but the music in this was horrible. Simply awful. Who decides to hire wailing singers in like every movie and drama? The music in general is awful! It never matched the mood in the later episodes and came at completely random moments. The key frames are also horrible, and like another review mentioned, we sometimes get a characters face for 2 minutes XD. The story is also lame as hell once you get into it more and more and reminds me of a very crappy copy of Inu Yasha minus the intrigue of the characters and their situation. Instead we get flat one dimensional characters, crap music, though great animation, and a super lame lets collect and travel the world(s) story.<br />
<br />
Overall I would not at all recommend this particular series. I know there are far better out there (though not entirely similar Kou Kara Maoh comes to mind). If you&#039;re wondering why the hell did Misc watch 11 episodes, well, DVD is more enjoyable than sitting in front of the laptop for however many hours I wasted XD.

    So after reading through the manga, getting impatient waiting for the dub, I watched the series on Youtube. And I&#039;m duly impressed. I had high expectations of this series, and so I when I heard about it I was skeptical (as my deep dark fantasy desire was to personally make this show my self) Of course being a fan-boy to Koichi Mashimo and and Yuki Kajiura It boosted my confidence more.<br />
<br />
The plot is well adapted. Anime has the double edge sword when it comes to adaptation, either it&#039;s a very very loyal adaption nearly 100% in which case there is no longer a point to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review3510">
        read the manga, or it&#039;s so different that you wonder, did the writers just read the summary on the back of the book?  But this is adapted in both differently while playing true to the Manga. The occasional sub-plots provide for some dramatic moments. Such as the plot of Chu&#039;Nyan&#039;s (manga spelling) reunitment with her mother (I must admit I was crying during that point) and well other moments that proved to be not useless. Sub plots are tricky, you can milk them too much if you are not careful. Fortunately the play these out nicely.  There aren&#039;t too many and they aren&#039;t entirely pointless.  They provide for good character developments and expand the quest with out making it far too easy on the characters.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d have to say, at first I read some criticism about Kajiura&#039;s music score. But I have to say this is one of her finest yet. She has some very powerful, unique, and interesting melodies. Especially the opening piece. The opening scene is so powerful with visuals, and the music choice. I don&#039;t know Yuki to work a lot with bigger instrumental styles, but I do hear a lot. She seems to have a lot more orchestral than she does songs. Not like her usual motif. I&#039;m impressed, very impressed. I love the opening theme. While this wasn&#039;t a Kajiura composition (Also unusual for a Mashimo-Kajiura work) It&#039;s an awesome theme. <br />
<br />
Now many might complain about the long limbs. Frnakley I don&#039;t care. It&#039;s the same way in the manga, as it is in the Anime. As long as the Animation doesn&#039;t look like paper cut outs, I don&#039;t have any complaints.  I think BEE TRAIN was actually trying to replicate the style seen in the manga which they didn&#039;t need to do but they went out of their way to do it.  Minako Shiba has done fantastic with her character designers and the BEE TRAIN Staff shine the anime.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest flaws is the constant flash back usage of previous episodes. I find my self fast forwarding through the episode as it slowly recaps what happened. And in these flash backs, they have real continuity problems.  Unfortunately they get a little carried away with the flashbacks.  It&#039;s very clear Mashimo doesn&#039;t fear a slow paced plot.  Which has it&#039;s ups and downs.<br />
<br />
Great acting from the Japanese cast. Particularly Yui Makino as Sakura. As for the U.S. cast I feel Monica Rial was not the best choice.  She simply was not for this role, she&#039;s a good actress but this was just not the role I could see her in. Other than that the English cast is an all star knock out.  Though I would have had some preferences for other characters.  They do their best and that&#039;s all we can ask for right?  I felt Vic and Sabat were fantastic choices for Fay and Kurogane, Savage not as much for Mokona. <br />
<br />
I say see this series. If you are a CCS fan. Manga Fan, see this Anime.

    I haven&#039;t watched Card Captor Sakura, but I heard that both these series are serialized by Clamp and both have main characters.  But I do not know how alike they are in attitude. What I do know is that both have the same facial features.  As such, the art has no originality, though, they were created by the same animators, in the end, you can&#039;t help but correlate both characters.  <br />
<br />
Storyline wise, traveling to other worlds is interesting, but it doesn&#039;t keep the audience hooked, in my case that is.<br />
<br />
The art would be difficult in my own opinion, since it would take

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1029">
        a lot of brain storming to create a different kind of world.  And having succeeded at doing it, Clamp is worthy of praise.<br />
<br />
Music, I believe stands out in this series.  I am a lover of classical, opera and chorale music and using such genre appealed to me.  Unfortunately, playing the same music that stand out, over and over, in the long run became annoying to me.<br />
<br />
Like I said, some of the characters have no originality.  But since this is a crossover between Card Captor  Sakura, maybe they intentionally did it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment.  I did enjoy it, but not to the point where I would hang out with it over time.  I watched it because I have no other thing to watch.<br />
<br />
Overall, I give it a 7.6.  This is mainly because it did not cater to my age range.  Although there are shojo productions out there that were outstanding, this was just mundane.  I&#039;d recommend this to teens aged 10-18.

    Seeing as I haven&#039;t read the manga for this show (or any manga for that matter) I won&#039;t be referring or comparing these two (as I hear that the manga is &amp;quot;way&amp;quot; better than the show).<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
To me the story didn&#039;t seem to be very great from the start. Basically in the first episode everything was put together and it felt rushed and was a very lazy way to introduce the characters and plot. Then after I watched further into the show I got even more disappointed as I found out that the style of Tsubasa was just a bunch of mini stories making up the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5032">
        show that didn&#039;t really develop the initial story. However, I did like how Tsubasa would come up with different ideas of the mini stories making it somewhat interesting to see what would happen next, except then I kept finding myself getting annoyed by the fact that none were very good and lacked interest.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Well once again I still find that art/animation isn&#039;t very hard to accomplish with today&#039;s standards. Like most animes the animation was pretty much the same as any other anime. The characters were well drawn and the backgrounds were up to detail. There was one point where I felt I was watching an anime from the 90&#039;s because of the poorly drawn facial expressions and extras, but everything else felt normal as normal gets.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
This may be a little biased, but the sound was very corny at times. I know they were trying to be dramatic (or maybe romantic) by playing slow music during some of the episodes and it would have been good if they didn&#039;t do it for 5 times. After hearing it over and over again it became (to me at least) a joke. Like: &amp;quot;Oh god, now there doing a music montage and getting 10 different close-ups of everyones face.&amp;quot; They could have done with a little variety of background music also, seeing as they were visiting different worlds that could do with more than just the same tune. As for theme songs I thought they were good and helped set the mood of the story.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Usually when I watch an anime there&#039;s always one character whom I wish would simply die and get out of the picture. In this show, although it was close at times,  there wasn&#039;t really any characters I hated. When I first began to watch this show I already knew what the roles and personalities of all the main characters would most likely be and I was dead on for all of them except Sakura. I don&#039;t know if that is a positive to know what the characters would be like because then I easily predicted (and they were all so predictable) what each character would do and got bored of seeing the same thing happen. Predictability is no problem if the characters themselves are interesting which I found most to be. Also as a side note there were no supporting characters. For example if you see a new character and he/she leaves the picture then there outta there! FOR GOOD =)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I guess I could say this show had a bad start for me and if I would have only watched they first half then I would probably give enjoyment a 3. But then after a while I started to enjoy some of the episodes and thought that overall it was an ok if not good show to watch. Maybe its just me but, this show is too soft (this is coming from someone who likes gorey animes). Not great but not bad so I give it a 7. (6 to me is where I begin start to hating)

    I think i need to add something here.. i don&#039;t expect anybody to vote how useful my review was.. but let me just say this. (This is just my opinion ^_^) There is a lot of responses to this anime that there is a lot of filler and pointless scenes. however i have to disagree.<br />
<br />
1) Each of the characters grow more and more into their roles.<br />
<br />
2) Not always will they go to a dimension and find a feather... so of course there will be episodes that seem there is no reason that they should even be there. The characters have no idea what realm the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review5978">
        feathers are in.<br />
<br />
2) Clamp is trying to introduce all of their previous characters from other animations into this one. So i&#039;d assume some of it is just for our enjoyment of seeing them appear.<br />
<br />
3) If the anime moved any faster then there are things that happen that are impossible to answer if the story doesnt explain itself as it goes... <br />
<br />
I do know not to expect it is exactly like the manga but it doesnt always follow exact.  i hope my words are clear enough. I will say this.. The OVA is the best of the series so far. Very dark like the manga and its by a different studio, not bubble-bee. =) Please watch it when you finish the first 2 seasons of this wonderful series.

    I enjoyed the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle manga immensely so when I found the anime I was very excited. But after the first few episodes I realized some major problems with the series. My two main issues being that they recap on the story far too often and the music doesn&#039;t fit the mood sometimes. And then the very last episode of the season ended with Sakura wishing for people who had died to return which goes against the whole theme of the manga. Overall I enjoyed this but I felt very frustrated while watching it at times.

    Story (7) - Very slow pace, with lots of fillers. There was 1 or 2 interstings story arcs, but the rest is disapointing. I believe it&amp;acute;s not the story itself, since the manga doesnt seem to have that problem. Its how it was develloped in this series. As i said in the start, the story lost itself between many fillers, long long conversations explaining things that didnt make any sense to be explained, while other important things were left behind undevelloped.<br />
So, only a 7 in this aspect.<br />
<br />
Art (8-) - Nothing really special, however, some good appointments in terms of character design. The rest in just

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9974">
        enough to be considered good.<br />
<br />
Sound (10+) - For me, the best aspect in the whole series. I liked the op and ed, and background music is just amazing. It gives a lot of atmosphere and fits very well with this type of anime. Character voices were also pretty well made, and in general, sound fits very well with the rest. <br />
It is certantly not because of sound that this anime disappointed me. <br />
<br />
Character (8-) - I liked them, in terms of image and role in the story. Its quite a good creation, but as it came closer to the end, i noticed that they are not that well develloped, and the relations between them seemed a little bit messed up.<br />
Still, this is good enough, although i think manga seems to be much better in this aspect (comparing with what i already saw from the manga).<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6-) - I dont even need to be an expert to notice the big number of fillers in this anime. It turned most of the episodes (with exception of 1/2 arcs) boring, sleepy, and not interesting at all. Many moments with lots of conversation/lack of action, some long pauses, and aspects/information with not sense at all, clearly used to fill in time in the series. <br />
Well, not everything was bad. One of the beginning arcs, and the last one gave some interest to watch (that was quickly replaced by an poor, really poor last episode :s) , but its too few for an anime wich i had some expectations.<br />
<br />
overall (7) - I dont even need to see all the manga to find out why this is not a good one. It disappointed me a lot.<br />
With the exception of the music aspect, wich i give the credit because it was really good, the rest was far below my expectations. <br />
The fillers, lack of action and lots of conversations....and who knows, probably after reading more from the manga i will find some more negative aspects about this one.<br />
<br />

    As Vladimir Putin has once said, &quot;I&#039;ll be brief&quot;.<br />
<br />
I stumbled upon this anime after watching &quot;Chobits&quot;. I was quite familiar with CLAMP and some of their works, so I decided to fill this particular gap in my aсquaintance with this series.<br />
<br />
People often say &quot;No regrets&quot;, but I DO regret watching Tsubasa Chronicles.<br />
Why? Well, let me tell you.<br />
<br />
First - the story is your basic and &quot;favorite&quot; GONNA CATCH &#039;EM ALL!!11 (sad smiley) type of stories. Our heroes travel through different worlds trying to find Sakura-hime&#039;s feathers in order to get her memories and personality back. <br />
<br />
The premise is kinda promising, but the execution is very poor

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71107">
        - the worlds are unimaginitive, plain and boring as cows. Or sheep (they&#039;re actually quite funny and cute, so I&#039;ll stick with cows). There was one TV-show called &quot;Sliders&quot; (sadly with living human beings), which had a similair premise with much better execution. In other words, the idea is not so unoriginal, but it could have been done better.<br />
<br />
A few words about art &amp; sound. I think the animators&#039; salary was something about a bowl of rice, because graphics in this show are very dull and greyish. No bright colors, no decent animation, the show looks very cheap. Hell, I&#039;ve seen some hentai drawn better than that!<br />
<br />
Sound is little better, but it&#039;s still just average. The same musical tracks are repeated over and over, even when they don&#039;t fit the scene at all. Hey, but who cares? The animator guy ate the last bowl of rice, so our composer will have to work for an &quot;arigatou&quot;.<br />
<br />
One thing that made me hate this show is the characters. Yeah, Kurogane and Fai are nice fellows, but Syaoran and especially Sakura made my dinner go out of my mouth every time I saw them on screen. Syaoran is one of the most dull and uninspired shounen heroes of all the time. I think he has no personality, just this blind and exaggerated loyalty towards Sakura, who says nothing but &quot;SYAORAN-KUN!&quot; ALL THE TIME. Hell, in one episode she shouted it for about 9 times, on some occasions - FOR NO REASON. Yep, that&#039;s all she does in this show - being a helpless and a mentally challenged damsel in distress. It&#039;s not quite and makes you want to protect her, it&#039;s simply pathetic.<br />
<br />
The story feels like it should&#039;ve been made in 12 episodes, the plot moves sooo slow and it&#039;s too predictable. There&#039;s a glimpse of an intrigue in the last story arc, but it is resolved undescribably silly.<br />
<br />
Just like the whole show - it&#039;s not fun, it&#039;s not original, it&#039;s not curious. It&#039;s just silly.<br />
<br />
And boring, as a result.<br />

    I went from Cardcaptor Sakura to this series, so overall I think I saw an improvement atleast in the maturity level. And though there were some things I found lacking I am going to continue to the second season. <br />

It is a really interesting story idea and I just love the chance to explore different worlds. The characters have some depth, unique traits and all set eachother apart nicely. Also, the interactions between characters is pretty amusing. Actually, the anime overall is pretty funny as well as being serious. It touches on issues that CC seemed to skirt around and actually makes you &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; for

There was a lot of potential, but as the story moves on it almost seems to get less interesting. I saw this in CC as well. Each episode&#039;s format is repetitive and that started to cause me to lose interest. Also, sometimes the expressions on the characters faces drove me nuts... during certain scenes they would appear placid, when I felt there should have been more emotion. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is something that I enjoyed when I was bored. It was not something that I obsessed over or had to watch constantly until I finished the season. Yet, it does have a unique story and is an easy watch. I probably will not ever rewatch it, but it is definitely something I don&#039;t regret watching.

    First I saw CCS, then I noticed a new anime called Tsubasa Chronicles.<br />
I thought it was a sequel, but it was a new story.<br />
And even when I first lay eyes on this anime, I fall for it ^-^<br />
<br />
This anime is quite touching, even if it have action and fantasy in it.<br />
<br />
Two childhood friend who develop feeling for each other.<br />
<br />
Syaoran sacrifise the relationship between him and Sakura, so Sakura would live even if he knows that she wouldn&#039;t remember him.<br />
<br />
But as the story goes, Sakura once more fall for Syaoran, without the past memories of them.<br />
<br />
I often tears whenever there&#039;s a flashback about them...

    The storyline is wonderful, the sound track is amazing and the characters all give an extra plot twist to the real storyline. Sadly, the anime doesn&#039;t really reach a point that it actually gets to the main storyline. <br />
<br />
Tsubasa Chronicle is a good show if you&#039;re a shoujo addicted fangirl, looking for some new anime. But it&#039;s certainly nothing good for the die hard CLAMP and TRC-manga fans. If you have no problems with reading the manga instead of watching the anime, I&#039;m telling you, go read the manga. <br />
<br />
Animation is a disappointment. Art is also pretty screwed up. Even I, someone without eye for

The OVA = BIg yes.<br />
The manga = to die for.

    i don&#039;t like writing long reviews because i feel like it&#039;s boring and would be a waste of your valuable time. Personally I think that this anime is one of the &quot;greats&quot;. I&#039;ve seen plenty of anime, and while the plot may not be extremly  deep, it&#039;s still wicked interesting. Its basically about one dude who goes out looking for fragments ( feathers) of the girl he likes. now normally this plot would suck, but it doesnt. It&#039;s blended with tons of other stories and tons of other characters, and slowly you see how brilliant the story really is. I reccommend  that you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25885">
        watch this. the art may not be to what your used to in 2010, but it&#039;s good enough to look past. in fact you probably won&#039;t care because of the great characters and story, Ill admit that the anime has 1 achillies heel tho. and that&#039;s that it ENDS. well not ends but i should say doesn&#039;t get completed. it just kinda pulls you in, doesn&#039;t let go, and then kinda drop kicks you when you get to the OAV&#039;s. <br />
                                           <br />
well i guess this is kinda long, o well. So all in all, watch it. now. I&#039;m promising you that your like it, and if you don&#039;t then your a ginger for you have no souls.I&#039;m kidding, maybe.

    The animation was the worst I have ever seen. All the characters were tall and lankey. I mean it was bad! It looked like something my eight old sister drew up on the spot. This really surprised me because I&#039;ve seen other CLAMP Animes such as X and Card Captors and Tsubasa Chronicle does even compare. The bad art totally cancels out the interesting plot. <br />
<br />
Tip to Manga Readers- From what I here they cut of alot of the good stuff when they made the anime because it aired in Children&#039;s Hour. <br />
<br />
SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN AND DON&#039;T WATCH THIS!!!
