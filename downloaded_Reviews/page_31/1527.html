    Contains spoilers. Not that anything could sour this anime more than merely watching it, but hey.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the western anime community is made up of kids, teenagers, and college kids, and as the medium becomes more and more mainstream, that bell curve keeps centering around lower and lower ages. Many within this community of young people have grown up with anime and can reminisce about shows like Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach which have been influential for as long as they can remember, teenagers on the older side can still remember their own era’s shows like Pokemon or Dragon Ball, and now the

        newest generation of children growing up with anime have faces like My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 to grow up with themselves. I don’t have any of that. I’m seasoned enough for even the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia to loose their effects, since a good ninety percent of anime I can remember watching with few late 90s exceptions the likes of Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop rerunning on TV have been viewed through my eyes as they are now. I can’t ride on nostalgia and fond memories I don’t have, but I can ride on lies.<br />
<br />
Fairy Tail came and settled into my life of extreme clinical depression and violent self-harming, intently suicidal tendencies in a roller coaster of fashions. Watching something so vapid and kiddish began by simply making me feel even dumber and even lonelier by getting into a show aimed at an audience nearly half my age, but after getting along with my streak of nihilism at the time, it soon became my single favorite show ever made, seriously. Just hearing Natsu and Lucy autistically screaming about the power of friendship ad nauseam was enough to lift my spirits, no matter how hollow those feelings were. No matter how little sense it all made, I truly did come to love Fairy Tail and the cast of characters therein. I’d always rated it lowly as I do currently, but never would I deny how genuinely I adored it despite its countless flaws, lacks, and offenses. No matter how many victories they won without a shred of logic, no matter how many times villainous motivations would break and birth new allies apropos of nothing, and no matter how many times they’d tease a romance only to never make a single iota of progress for hundreds of episodes, I always left the viewing with life in my eyes, because at the end of the day, everyone was a friend and friendship was magic. In my real life, “friendship” stands only as a childish dream my insomnia never permitted me to relish in, but if I remembered the Fairy Tail necklace I was wearing hidden under my formal attire, I could keep going, if only for one more day.<br />
<br />
During Fairy Tail’s first hiatus, A-1 Pictures had made it crystal clear they would be picking the series back up in 2014, and they did exactly that, but when the next break came in 2016, they gave no indication of it coming back, much to my dismay. I was horrified by the idea of losing this lovable guild of friends who I cared for more than my own family, so when the manga announced its plans to end, and the production committee behind it announced they would fund its final season set to adapt the rest of the manga, I was absolutely overjoyed. After all, I was finally getting to see my friends again. As the Fall 2018 season approached, and they started airing promotional videos, I was kind of taken aback. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I knew how technically bad Fairy Tail was. Be it the terrible animation, overuse of still frames and speed lines, endless off-model character artwork, a totally nonsensical script, infinite plot holes, egregious filler arcs, or the brain numbing pacing, I was always more than willing to say, “Yeah, but I still love it.” That being said, watching these promotional videos was the first time I noticed Fairy Tail was the only show I did this for. Anyone whose seen my profile knows how painstakingly critical I am, and the single bad show I refused to drop was Fairy Tail. Since I refuse to watch low quality anime, the time Fairy Tail was on break was enough time for me to completely forget what it was like to sit through a bad show. I know I’m coming off as sarcastic, but I’m being completely serious. I simply forgot what it was like to watch a poorly produced, poorly written, poorly paced, poorly directed, poorly acted, generically scored show without dropping it nigh instantly, and trying to get back into it was an unforgiving, brutal challenge. I knew I should’ve just left well enough alone and trying to watch the final season would do nothing but expose all my blissfully ignorant yet recently made fond memories…but I did it anyway. Whilst all those happy memories were, indeed, trampled into ruin exactly as I thought they would be, I’ve come to argue the degree to which they were was not entirely my own fault. After all, even after forgetting the feeling of watching a bad show, if Fairy Tail had returned exactly as it was when it left, then all I could really say was touché.<br />
<br />
And for the zero people still reading, I suppose this is where the “review” actually starts…<br />
<br />
Fairy Tail: Final Series is unquestionably among the worst pieces of so-called entertainment I’ve ever committed the sin to consume, and I’m going to do my absolute best at selling you on this horrendous reality as fast as possible, because I want to be here doing this just about as much as the corporatized, probably zombified staff wanted to produce it. To start, I’ll acknowledge the elephant in the room: who in the fuck cares? No matter what argument I propose and no matter the eloquence or logic with which I do so, who the hell cares if a shitty series no one respected anyway went from bad to worse? FANS! All the dumbfuck fans, LIKE ME, no matter how stupid we are for already liking a bad show, have the right to be angry when that standard which we’ve grown entitled to gets even worse. And, holy SHIT, did it get worse or what?! The animation went from poor and lacking to outright non-existent. Entire minutes, literal complete minutes were spent just panning over everyone’s face any time the slightest movement was made, any time someone said anything even remotely emotional, and any time the screenwriter knew they couldn’t animate the action and had to instead show people flatly reacting to it. The sound design went from repetitive and boring to straight up inaccurate. Gunshots used the same sound effect as doors closing, and Natsu getting comically slapped by Lucy was the same sound effect used when someone literally slammed into the ground after falling out of the damn sky. It’s a complete and total joke no fan of the series could laugh at. The directing went from stock and amateur to inexcusably dishonest. As mentioned, whenever the budget would run out and they couldn’t animate an impact, they would awkwardly hard-cut to someone else’s still face reacting to it. This was the case with action scenes, obviously, but also in fucking DIALOGUE SCENES! IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO ANIMATE THREE FUCKING FRACTIONS OF AN ALREADY STILL SURROUNDING FRAME FOR SOMEONE’S MOUTH TO OPEN AND CLOSE?!?!?! The pacing went from purposefully slow to drag out the series for as long as possible to breakneck rapid fire speed because now all they wanted to do was finish the damn thing since the cash cow apparently became infertile. Remember the big tease Gray was going to kill Frosh? Got retconned; forget about the Rouge from the future and all the plot lines tied to his actions. Remember how Zeref was a legendary black wizard known even outside of Fiore? Got retconned; apparently he’s so poorly known, he can be the king of an entire foreign nation, merely under a different name, without ANYONE outside the country being aware of this fact. Remember the big bad Emperors of Ishgar who were hyped up to be greater than all the Wizard Saints? Got retconned; they all go down at the same time at the hands of some random guy who&#039;s owned barely four minutes later. Remember all the symbolism suggesting Mavis to be the fundamental antithesis of Zeref? Got retconned; not only do they have the EXACT SAME CURSE AND POWERS, but they got them by literally falling in love. I could go on. No effort was expended explaining anything properly or concluding the series in a satisfying manner because all they wanted to do was finally put the last nail in the bloody coffin as soon as livingly possible. Even when the characters were given a few paltry scraps of time to develop, we were treated with bafflingly retarded lines like Precht holding Mavis’ dead, cold, limp, pale, lifeless fucking corpse, looking at it in its closed eyes and asking, “Mavis, are you dead?” Even when the characters were given equally paltry scraps of time to explain the plot and motivations, we were treated with equally retarded lines like Zeref looking at his counsel of nameless lackeys saying, “Humanity must be temporarily exterminated.” Like, seriously?!? The one and only aspect of the series which remained consistent with previous seasons was the music, but that’s only because they wholesale reused the soundtrack. I don’t know why I’m complaining, though, seeing as if they did put in the work to actually recompose anything properly, it probably would’ve been just as awful as the rest. If you wanted a silver lining, I guess I could say there’s a few opening animations which aren’t bad and the show never fully gives up by falling back on CG, but that’s really all I’ve got for you. I’m sorry. Believe me, I wish I had more to offer too.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, there is a moment from episode twelve which really summed up my experience with Fairy Tail: Final Series in one nice little package. They were saying some dumb shit—I wasn’t really paying attention—and I realized as they were panning across the guild hall the characters just…weren’t drawn. You’ll have to see it to believe it, but they just weren’t drawn. I was looking at a guild hall of greyed out silhouettes. When I really looked closely, shocked, as I couldn’t believe what I was seeing either, I could pick out who was who, I guess. I could make out Gajeel’s Sonic The Hedgehog hairdo and Bickslow’s weird helmet thing. I could make out Elfman’s broad shoulders and Mirajane’s bangs in that quirky little ponytail of her&#039;s. But why did I have to? Was it so hard to draw the faces of the people I couldn’t wait to see again? Couldn’t you’ve just grabbed a frame from another scene and reused it as a still image? Hell, couldn’t you’ve just copy and pasted their god damn character models right off file into the scene, again, just as a still image? It’s not like the silhouettes were animated. How many seconds of care would you have to expend to add them this one time for this one unanimated scene? This bleak lack of any semblance of passion or investment will be my last memories of what once was the most beloved series in my small world.<br />

    [Spoiler Warning]<br />
<br />
Ahhhhh, Friendship and Magic has finally returned with its 3rd season. No, it&#039;s not My Little Pony I am talking about, but Fairy Tail. This time around our main characters, Rarity and Appleja... oh sorry, I mean Natsu and Gray are hanging out with their little club and every goddamn villain they fight against, joins their ranks because that&#039;s the way Fairy Tail&#039;s heart beats. It&#039;s friendship time!<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Annoyed by very superficial, core level flaws that are practically self-explanatory? Too bad. How Fairy Tail works is completely different from the norms as it abandons every fuck it could ever give about avoiding such things. Instead,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295458">
        the story entirely focuses on doing whatever it wants with the best sides it has [No matter how &quot;bad&quot; its best is]. Let&#039;s face it, the more there is content, the more room there is for all sorts of different issues, common tropes, general cliches, character flaws, logical errors that in generally, are hidden in the details in purpose of fooling the viewer into thinking that &quot;this shit is actually good&quot;. Fairy Tail does not lie, it does&#039;t try to hide its flaws anywhere. What we have at hand is perhaps the single most &#039;Be Yourself&#039; anime I have had the pleasure of watching, and for that reason, I really like it. <br />
<br />
On a technical level, under every single general quality trait, upon analyzing, Fairy Tails achievements are miniscule, but what it does is go beyond the norms and for that reason, it is among the most intelligent anime series I have seen, but no, not in its content -- I would never claim such a thing -- but in its making. It doesn&#039;t care. And I don&#039;t want care either, and for that reason, it is the ideal show for me. Simple? Well, it really is not! For example: Let&#039;s imagine for a second that this thing actually has a plot. In that case, the series would very likely be much, much worse than it currently is because the author is really horrible at writing anything (except zero arc which was pretty damn good actually). The best decision he has ever made, was create this series without it having a plot. Intelligence.<br />
<br />
The other amazing factor here is the fact that Fairy Tail cannot do anything that makes the story worse than it already is. Watching this series for that reason is a real blessing. No! I am not joking the least, and do not think for a second that is an insult because it is actually the biggest praise I can give. For example, when I watched some highly appreciated series -- which I will not mention by names, you can find them on any top 20 anime list on the interweb basically -- many of them contained this one cliche which I absolutely hate. Whenever a character is about to die, another character/nakama  quite literally teleports there and saves the other character from certain death in the very last second. It&#039;s so f****** annoying that it kills all the believability for myself in works that were otherwise good. When Fairy Tail does this exact same thing, it is not even a flaw but a pure feature/attribute that the viewer already expects of it. For that reason, Fairy Tail does what so many other shows can only dream of: It never disappoints. It simply can&#039;t. And that&#039;s precisely why the story is such a major success. This is one of the very few series which I can watch without asking any questions because I wholeheartedly acknowledge that there are no answers. It may be childish and problematic, but damn if the series doesn&#039;t know what it is. What I would in other cases call &quot;an absolute horseshit of a writing&quot;, In Fairy Tail&#039;s case, I casually laugh and say &quot;oh, that&#039;s just Fairy Tail being Fairy Tail.&quot; In one way, this entire series is Moon Moon the meme except it&#039;s an anime: this anime. I can&#039;t hate it, it&#039;s too special and precious. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Like scarce  amount of shonen series -- which I will not namedrop here -- Fairy Tail does what so many others are so afraid to do: Give us canon pairings already when the series is still ongoing. 2/3 of the big 3 were nothing but a tease, the last one purely uses girls in comedic fanservice. The biggest meme, by Bones, made romantic situations a damn running gag. Fairy Tail&#039;s characters are never disrespected in this manner nor any manner. In fact, they are loved so much and so deeply that even every single mildly interesting villain join Fairy Tail&#039;s side because letting go off them is not an option. And that&#039;s okay. I think that&#039;s great. It&#039;s one thing for the viewers to hate characters, but when authors choose any of the routes mentioned above, it doesn&#039;t become pretty to watch. I unironically respect the guy because I find the romances and the feeling side of Fairy Tail to be genuine and honest unlike in so many other shonen series where &quot;romances&quot; become nothing but disgusting and dishonest comedic banter just so viewers would keep their interest and follow the characters like their unconfirmed shipping relations are some sort of ongoing cliffhanger that keeps them watching the damn thing. It&#039;s so fake and purely exist to fool the viewers to a point where the fans try to convince themselves that given pairings would be some sort of &quot;fanservice&quot; while it&#039;s the opposite. Let&#039;s face it, Gajeel x Levy is the most &quot;canon&quot; canon-pairing ever written by man, and that&#039;s my biggest reason for thinking these characters are great.<br />
<br />
Production:<br />
<br />
The last season certainly had a worse start considering it had about as much animation as the manga. This season still has lots of still pictures going on and money is saved pretty much whenever it is possible. Fairy Tail&#039;s viewers are familiar with this so continuity exists at least. Personally I don&#039;t mind anymore as long as it never gets as bad as in the beginning of 2014. The seiyuu work is naturally identical as well, and the glorious OST is still there. The OP and ED are bit weird choices. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Fairy Tail is a flawed work, but none of its flaws are something the viewer is supposed to forgive like is the case with so many  supposedly &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;good&quot; anime series. Fairy Tail doesn&#039;t give a damn, and that&#039;s exactly why it is so enjoyable and entertaining series to watch. I do NOT think &quot;Fairy Tail is so bad that it is good&quot;, I think Fairy Tail is completely off the scale because Fairy Tail is not a good series in the most common definition of the word. It&#039;s its own thing and stays loyal to it, which may not me enough for everyone. However, I am willing to take this series with its problems and weaknesses and by doing so, I have seen how entertainment, in its purest form, is born.<br />
<br />
ps, I saw season 2 actually twice and upon my study, I discovered that Mira Strauss is the best girl

    The FINAL SEASON...until the 100 Year Quest gets adapted...<br />
<br />
No but seriously for a &quot;final season&quot;, Fairy Tail really brought their all or more or less Hiro Mashima amalgamated all his loose plotlines (especially with the deal with Zeref and Acnologia) not only to a grand final war but to resolve the MANY MANY characters plot threads it gave us and the majority of it...succeeded.<br />
<br />
LA had been and still was a huge fan of Fairy Tail, Fairy Tail brought LA into the shounen genre and though Fairy Tail did abuse the entire &quot;nakama&quot; arc finales as an asspull let alone it&#039;s &quot;no one dies&quot; attitude and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318594">
        to this end makes Natsu has immense plot armour and one-shots every main arc villain in the series, all these flaws bar one or two get given some context and actual reasoning to, the exception being the &quot;nakama&quot; BUT LA even has a defense for that (to a certain extent) and that is..well Fairy Tail was ALWAYS about nakama or family, heck Fairy Tail was always about camaraderie even in the worst of times and most of the characters centred on family one way or another, Lucy with her father, Cana and Gildarts, Natsu and Igneel, Gray and Ur and Wendy with the guild itself. Yes Fairy Tail had some problems be it it&#039;s filler arcs or the flaws LA mentioned above but man this final season remedied ALOT of the problems it had.<br />
<br />
With this being the culmination to the final battles against Zeref and Acnologia, the character development and the lore intertwining things to make sense was all there. For character development the main players gets the most screentime, expanded both on the world building and lore of Fairy Tail to ties things together, everything from why the Year 777 was soo important, Lucy&#039;s mother, the Dragon Slayers themselves, Zeref and his conflict and war with Mavis and how Acnologia came to be. It&#039;s all covered here. If anything the main characters who get the most screentime and development became Natsu, Zeref, Mavis, Acnologia, Erza, Wendy, Gray and Lucy though LA thought that Lucy once again took the fanservicey status and her backstory was more towards her family line than her as a character came into play but nonetheless she was a central player...mainly helping Natsu in all this but still.<br />
<br />
The battles were crazy to say the least, mainly because of Zeref&#039;s Elite commanders, being mages of ABSURD magical strength and having them pitted against not only Fairy Tail themselves but EVERY guild (including the main dark guilds who have turned over a new leaf giving THEM redemption as well as well as minor development as well). But most of the battles were interesting in how the character overcome it as...well Natsu was focused on Zeref, it gave the rest of the cast a chance to shine MAINLY Erza, Gray, Wendy and Gajeel. YES...sometimes they used nakama power but....ummmm...it&#039;s cool ok.<br />
<br />
The animation done by A-1 Pictures, Bridge and Cloverworks...well the animation was toned and alot sharper, the fighting and battles scenes were much more fluid and intense and because of the tone, the character designs and quirky and exotic as they were were crisper and much sharper than before, since this was a collaboration between three studios, LA can see the animation was consistently great (aside from the rare derps) because of it and considering the animation was consistent for 51 episodes and still the final few episodes were greatly detailed and batshit cazy in terms of battles...well what else woul LA say but bravo A-1 Pictures, Bridge and Cloverworks!<br />
<br />
The voice cast was utterly HUGE so LA will go by the simple standouts or MVP&#039;s...for LA they were Mamiko not as Mavis, Akira Ishida as Zeref, Tetsuya Kakihara as Natsu, Sayaka Ohara as Erza, Yuuichi Nakamura as Gray, aya Hirano as Lucy, Satomi Sato as Wendy, Rie Kugimiya as Happy, Kousuke Toriumi as Acnologia, Takako Honda as Eileen Belserion, Manami Numakura as Brandish, Saori Hayami as Kagura, Show Hayami as Ichiya (yes really) and Kana Hanazawa as Zera, seriously a damn great voice cast if LA could go on this section would be HUGE.<br />
<br />
Fairy Tail: Final Series is nothing but a great send off to the series, as it just ties everything up from 10 years of Fairy Tail anime, sure in a bit of shaking ways especially considering the nakama power activating time to time but like LA said, it&#039;s kinda what Fairy Tail embodies time and again and Fairy Tail just wraps everything in a crescendo. <br />
<br />
LA had and always will be a fan of Fairy Tail even when it was in it&#039;s lowest moments and in a time when Fairy Tail was looked down upon, LA always stick by it and wanted to get better and with this Final Season it did. Fairy Tail was LA&#039;s first shounen anime and be it the annoying filler arcs, Natsu&#039;s plot armour, Lucy&#039;s unneeded fanservice and of course the nakama eleventh hour superpower but even with all that this Final Season did it&#039;s job and ended the way it wanted too and by god, did it go out great.<br />
<br />
Here&#039;s to Fairy Tail and a close to Zeref and Acnologia as the Big Bads of the series...<br />

    Fairy Tail, Fairy Tail. What can the world do without you? From its original run back in August 2006 to July 2017, the fantasy adventure has been dubbed as a popular franchise that became famous for its “friendship” theme. It’s become so well-known that the words “friends” has become synonymous with the franchise itself. Now, we finally have the conclusion of this long-running fantasy adventure.<br />
<br />
The final season initially had mixed reception so seeing this been translated into anime form would also generate some degree of trepidation. I approached this final season with some optimism as a voice told me it would be a proper sendoff

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318601">
        of the show but far from a masterpiece. From the first few episodes, It reintroduced the main characters we are so familiar with – Natsu, Happy, Lucy, Erza, Gray. The Fairy Tail guild itself is no longer the same as we remember. But surely enough, the final season begins to slowly reintroduce the other familiar cast ranging from Wendy, Gajeel, Laxus, Levy, and among many others. Perhaps most noticeable is the reintroduction of Zeref, a powerful dark wizard who has been an integral part of Fairy Tail’s expansive plot. Now, he’s a character with a purpose and takes on the role of an emperor with his own personal empire. The final season covers the Alvarez Empire arc that concludes the series.<br />
<br />
Looking back now, Zeref has been a complex character since his introduction. Now that he is in command of an empire, Zeref developed a more strategic and cunning mind who seeks to achieve his ambitions. The previous season also covered a side series (Fairy Tail Zero) that chronicled his relationship between Zeref and Mavis. The importance of their relationship carries an emotional degree that fully reaches its apex at the final stages of the season. To me, it’s a type of long-term development that actually works effective in terms of story writing. But from the start, we also have to realize the conflict Natsu and his friends to has to deal with now. From the Alvarez Empire, the Sparggan 12 serves as an elite unit of powerful wizards under Zeref. They consist of some of the most powerful adversaries Fairy Tail has ever encountered. From the arrogant sand mage Ajeel to god-like entities such as God Serena and August, there’s no doubt we’ll see the guild struggling to overcome these obstacles. Others such as Brandish and Irene has their own complex relationships with certain characters. I’m not going to spoil but it’s let’s just say that they are important to the overall tone of the season. Unfortunately, a decent portion of Sparrgan 12 are easily forgettable such as Jacob, Neihart, Bloodman, and Wall Eehto. I honestly forgot some of these characters and had to look them up again. Others such as Larcade and Invel has somewhat important roles in the show but honestly are overshadowed by powerful mainstays like Zeref. Collectively, they are a unique group of individuals that brings a thrilling sensation to the final arc. Individually, some just lacks presence on their own and suffers from stardom. <br />
<br />
Fairy Tail’s own members has their many spotlights although most of it is carried by the usual suspects. Of course, Natsu and Lucy play significant roles in determining the outcome of the arc. This is especially shown through Natsu’s complex relationship with Zeref. In one particular episode, we also get an important revelation about their origins. In the meantime, the final season also hopes to elicit character emotions beyond just the usual friendship gimmicks. Don’t expect much romance outside of Zeref and Mavis though. At this point, it’s pretty much established that Fairy Tail values its character connections more important than anything. As a guild, Fairy Tail has always been known for developing connections between its cast and forging bonds that lasts seemingly forever. From a storytelling perspective, it’s hardly unique as friendship themes have always been a part of many action adventures. It’s just that Fairy Tail amplifies its friendship context more than the usual. To me, it’s oversaturated and seemingly forced down our throats. Sure, it’s an important context of the show but when you’ve watched over 200 episodes of this, it gets pretty damn redundant, no? <br />
<br />
With 51 episodes, Fairy Tail final season does hit the sweet spot for concluding this anime. It doesn’t rely much on fillers to do the storytelling in this case and is actually quite faithful to the manga. The previous seasons had numerous filler episodes that can be a chore to get through. Some of those fillers were genuinely enjoyable while others had an entire arc of shallow writing. The final season gets straight to the point and commits most of its time on bringing out what the fans wants to actually see. The first half builds on the main plot while the second half executes what it establishes and ultimately brings together its conclusion. I’m not going to lie though. The final season is pretty much aimed at fans who really wants to see how this anime franchise wraps up. Chance are, some people just wants to finish the show and be done with the franchise for good. Others really wants to see the best of what Fairy Tail can offer. Personally, that part was long and done from the first seasons. The final season at best is a definitive end of the main story saga and as its worst is lazy writing that continues to use recycled ideas.<br />
<br />
However, I will give a credit where it’s due and that’s for Hiro Mashima’s work consistency. Being able to finish the manga from the start to finish with his weekly schedule is almost inhuman. When writing the script and storyboarding, I’d imagine he planned out well ahead of time. The mangaka is a madman when it comes to his speed of working. Why do I mention this? It’s because Fairy Tail’s art style has a cartoony look but can be deceptively complex at times to watch. Both the anime and manga also consist a lot of character emotions during important moments. Fairy Tail has been known for a lot of crying times and this final season is no pushover with those scenes. Emotions are drawn out by the main themes of the show and connects the characters together. A-1 Pictures return with their staff with a similar look to the previous seasons. And of course, any longtime fan will know Fairy Tail has fan service. It has lot of fan service, sometimes which can be dramatically distracting. There’s even jokes about the fan service itself with characters like Lucy being a main culprit. Gray taking his clothes off is also a running gag that melts Juvia’s little heart. <br />
<br />
The anime is over. This is the final season and I doubt we’ll see another Fairy Tail anime for a long time. If Hiro Hashima’s other works like Eden’s Zero or Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest ever gets adaptations, I’d imagine it to be much shorter than what we’ve seen here. The final season indeed concludes the long running Fairy Tail main saga that started between a fiery salamander and a blonde mage. And if you want to give it a chance, the ball is in your court.

    I guess the best way to review this anime would be to take you guys through my personal experience. I started watching the fairy tail anime back in 2013 when I was still 13 years old. I binge watched the first part, then I watched the second part as it came out and then now I started watching the finale. However, since I watched this anime the first time, I have become an active member of the anime community and I have watched lots and lots of different animes, and now, this anime just keeps becoming worse and worse in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Story - 6/10<br />
The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302778">
        is the only slightly attractive feature of this anime. The story is fluent and there are very few plotholes. The backstories of characters actually make sense and the connection between individual arcs is good. The stories have enough emotions tied to them.<br />
However, even though the story is the most attractive part of the anime, it doesn&#039;t compare to other famous animes. The story is filled with plot armor and nonsensical power-ups. For example, this series takes place a year after the last arc and in this one year, all the characters got incredibly strong and smart. We don&#039;t get to see how they trained or how they gained their powers. We just know that they became very strong in one year. <br />
The most appalling part, however, is the random power-ups in an on-going fight/match. The main character fights the underlings of the main boss and gets bet up very easily. Then, all of a sudden they get a flashback or a shout-out from a random friend and then they one-punch-knockout their opponents. Not only this but somehow, they restore their health completely and then fight the main boss only to be taken down instantly. There is some random show-off the main boss&#039;s power and then again, the main characters get some random power and one-punch-knockout the main boss regardless of how powerful the main boss is. <br />
<br />
Art - 5/10<br />
This is not an anime. This is just a colored manga with hints of hentai in it. One of the main female characters gets nude every time she transforms and another one apparently likes to seduce men. Like, literally, even her wiki fandom page says she likes to seduce men (lucy heartfilia). The only purpose of those two characters is to attract attention from hormone filled men who want to vent their stress. Their bewbs are the only attractive part of the &#039;art&#039; of this anime. <br />
The fighting scenes, as I mentioned earlier. are like a colored manga. It is a set of still shots (with obviously* unnecessary random bewb involvement) and the same tricks been used again and again. An anime like mob psycho 100 which is based on a webcomic drawn by an unprofessional, has far better-animated fights than this anime.<br />
<br />
Sound - 3/10<br />
The music is catchy, but they don&#039;t use it wisely in this anime. It is repeatitive and gets annoying if you watch the anime long enough. They have to literally play the music all the time.<br />
<br />
Character - 3/10<br />
Random power-ups, no character development, character whose only compelling feature is their bust, random flashbacks. unnecessary crying and most importantly over-display of &#039;friendship&#039;. The whole anime revolves around &#039;friendship&#039;. Each time you see a power-up, you will see the term &#039;friendship&#039; being used in the vicinity. <br />
Before someone bashes out on me for saying &#039;no character development, let me tell you what character development means. It means that there are some changes in your character due to some incidents. These changes are mostly positive changes and are supposed to make them more mature.    I guess the only display of character development is when Natsu learns to give up after fighting glidarts. (That&#039;s actually what made me give this factor a score of 3, instead 2)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 3/10<br />
As a teen, my pubescent hormone kept me attracted to this anime, but now that i don&#039;t feel the same attraction as before, I don&#039;t really find the point of watching this anime. I can watch other animes which are wayy better than this anime. You can just read the manga and enjoy the story rather than wasting time on this anime.<br />

    A very underwhelming, uninspired and seemingly passionless adaptation to an already terrible ending of the manga.<br />
<br />
Now that may seem harsh, but I think I&#039;m pretty justified in my description considering what we were given for the final season of Fairy Tail.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10): A small part of me believed that the anime would make some changes to the plot and maybe change, or at least extend, some of the weaker parts of the arc. Unsurprisingly, I was wrong. The story, in its grand climax, remained as anti-climactic as the manga was. To me, the final arc felt like it could go in so many directions, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318597">
        it somehow went in the most disappointing one.<br />
<br />
Art (3/10): The animation is probably one of the worst things about this season of Fairy Tail. It was full of fights and was the big climax of the entire series, and yet, it has the worst animation overall. At first, I was pretty optimistic. The colour pallet seemed vibrant and I thought, &quot;Well this animation kinda sucks, but hey, they&#039;re surely just saving their resources and time for some of the upcoming big fights!&quot; Unsurprisingly, I was wrong. Sure, there was an improvement in animation for some of the stuff towards the end, but it was still very much lacklustre considering that it was the big finale to such a long-running series. It only looked impressive because most other episodes were slideshows of coloured manga panels.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack (6/10): I don&#039;t feel like there&#039;s too much to say regarding the soundtrack. It&#039;s no secret that Fairy Tail has a kickass soundtrack. The thing is, this applies to the previous seasons too. In fact, there weren&#039;t actually that many new soundtracks in the first place - just a bunch of old ones. It felt like they used them to score nostalgia points from the viewers, which is nice, but it felt like some scenes could have been more impactful had they had a more fitting soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Character (5/10): The main characters in Fairy Tail are fun and lovable - they always have been. However, they&#039;re not particularly well-written, especially in this final season. Natsu and the gang are the same as always; a bunch of powerful wizards who love talking about their friends when things get rough. If you compare the main cast at the start of the series to how they are at the end, it doesn&#039;t feel like too much has changed. Their personalities are largely the same, but they punch harder. <br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment (4/10): So overall, the final season of Fairy Tail was just bad. It feels like the studio working on it just wanted to get it out of the way rather than give it the love it arguably deserved, or at the very least, needed. Don&#039;t get me wrong - I don&#039;t hate Fairy Tail. The first season, in particular, gave off a sense of adventure and fun that I&#039;ll never forget, and as such, it holds a special place in my heart.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s for that very reason that I think this season of Fairy Tail was a massive disappointment. It&#039;s sad to see a series like this go out on such a low, pathetic and badly written note.

    From all the reviews I&#039;ve seen, it seems that many people regard Fairy Tail as a great show, but I can&#039;t comprehend why. There are so many problems with this show, and I cannot understand how people do not see them. I&#039;m not really reviewing this specific season, but the anime as a whole. Fairy Tail actually had some potential, but Hiro Mashima and A-1 threw all of it into the trash. <br />
<br />
The writing is the first thing I want to address about this show. It is fucking stale. Out of the 300 episodes I have seen I swear that each arc except two contains

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305108">
        the exact same formula. For those who do not understand, each arc literally just consists of a new conflict and foe arising and the main characters defeating them. It goes through the same cycle over and over. The protagonists struggle a bit against the opponent and then thanks to the power of friendship, they are able to defeat them. I am not joking when I say most of the arcs just consists of this; this is an accurate description of them. There are only two arcs of this series which I actually liked thanks to the outcomes being different. I also want to mention that pacing is not very good, and arcs drag out way too long.<br />
<br />
I am not really a musical person, but in my opinion, sound is decent in this show. The music is good, but the problem is that it gets really overplayed. There isn&#039;t much variety, and I feel like I hear the same songs over and over. Voice acting is not that bad in Fairy Tail either.<br />
<br />
For people who do not realize, art and animation are two different things. The art in this show honestly isn&#039;t that bad. I don&#039;t remember there being many moments where facial expressions or bodies looked in an awkward way. Despite that, animation in this show is fucking awful. For being an action-based show, you would expect fights to be well animated, but it is the complete opposite. All of the fights consists of still frames and little animation. It is basically a colorized manga. I realize that this is not a seasonal show, but I wish that they would put even some effort into the important fights.<br />
<br />
Characters in this show are extremely average. The problem to me is just that there are way too many. I came into season three not remembering half of the characters&#039; names. I also just hate how fucking stupid the people in this show are. Any moment where there is suppose to be emotional and sympathetic value is ruined by fan-service put in every frame or an unfunny and forced joke. The majority of females looks exactly the same in this show; exact same facial expression and giant breasts. It really pisses me off as well that pretty much no characters have died either. Oh what&#039;s that, it looks like a character is about to die. No fuck that I&#039;m gonna be saved by some bullshit reason. It causes the show to have no sense of risk or danger because you know that the main characters are never going to die. Character development is somewhat nonexistent in this show as well. Most characters have remained the same throughout the entirety of the three seasons.<br />
<br />
Overall, Fairy Tail is a very mediocre anime. Black Clover may honestly be better than this shit. It is a show that would best be watched as background noise. I really wish that I could make myself drop this show, but I&#039;d prefer to stick to my policy of not dropping shows. For anyone who is considering to watch, I suggest you don&#039;t. Don&#039;t make the same mistake as me.

    A WORD OF WARNING!!!! I hereby bestow upon this anime the name of &quot;GIF&#039;s, The Animation!&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#039;m so annoyed with this that this is literally the first review I&#039;ve ever done. Maybe the first of many, I don&#039;t know.<br />
<br />
The animation for this season is AWFUL! I&#039;m writing this review to rant as well as point this out because I don&#039;t see anyone else talking about how lazy, ugly, &amp; absolutely pathetic the quality of the animation for this show has become.<br />
<br />
This is literally like watching a colored picture book with shaking backgrounds. Hell I&#039;m nicknaming this &quot;GIF&#039;s The Animation.&quot; Every fight scene consists of still cutouts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307423">
        of the character in question, then they animate the hair for 3 frames in repetition, add some screen shaking, movement lines, and wallah! That&#039;s your fight scene! What the heck is this!?<br />
<br />
On second thought, calling this show &quot;GIF&#039;s The animation&quot; is an insult to GIF&#039;s because I&#039;ve seen GIF&#039;s with better animation than this.<br />
<br />
What the hell am I even watching this for when I read the manga? I thought this was supposed to be an anime! You know, with ANIMATION! Not a glorified coloring book!<br />
<br />
I actually went back to season 1 to check out the fight scenes there because I don&#039;t remember it being this bad and guess what. They&#039;re not! Season 1&#039;s fight scenes are actually animated! Granted there are a lot of the same lazy still frames, but they animate when it counts! Their punches and kicks have &quot;Movement!&quot; But this show, just when you think there&#039;s going to be a big fight, when they introduce a new character into a major fight to change the outcome.... nothing but still frames.<br />
<br />
This is a new low, a new level of how to not even try, a new level of lazy, a new tier of cutting corners. All the fights are GIF&#039;s! They&#039;re not even bothering to animate punching. The most basic of all fight moves!!!<br />
They&#039;ve actually masked this laziness with CG Special effects for their magic! So at least it &quot;looks cool&quot; right?<br />
<br />
This is just a review on the animation aspect of this show. Waste your time at your own will. This is my warning. If you&#039;ve read this, you may as well just stick with the manga, because this anime, is not really an animation. <br />
<br />
Episode 41 update:<br />
I&#039;m impressed. With the Gildarts vs August fight in this episode, they really put some effort into it and it looked fantastic!<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I&#039;ve decided to summarize everything else.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
It deviates from the manga a bit as expected, but major plot points still in line. Watchers can still easily follow the story. They did add extra, extra, ultra layers of plot armor.<br />
<br />
Characters: Meh 5/10<br />
Not much to say. They haven&#039;t changed much. Just new abilities that have deus ex machina&#039;d their way into the show. Everyone still has plot armor so there&#039;s really no suspense at any point whatsoever. <br />
Update: Deus ex Machina plot armor powers intensified hardcore.<br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
We talked about this.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
Well thank god there&#039;s at least audio. I&#039;m no sound expert so, wish I could be more critical.<br />
<br />
Overall: 4/10<br />
I&#039;m being very generous with this because I&#039;ve seen worst shows. At least there&#039;s plot.

    These are dark times for my anime fan self. Somehow I keep being disappointed in every recent anime. Sadly, Fairy Tail (2018) is a disappointment as well.<br />
Long story short: while the audio is still top notch, the visuals are the worst of the whole series and the story is far from good.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
I like Fairy Tail, I&#039;m not ashamed to say it. Despite what people claim, it has great plots and great ideas (although it&#039;s often mixed with a lot of stupidity).<br />
This Final Series adapts the last 3 arcs of the manga: Avatar, Caracolle Island and the Final Arc.<br />
While I do enjoy Avatar and the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306280">
        half of the final arc (which has a lot of revelations and intense moments), the rest is really... uninspired. It&#039;s full of clichés, it&#039;s rushed, it&#039;s dumb. Caracolle Island is hilarious, but the Final Arc is really not worth it overall (it seems to be usual in the anime industry...).<br />
<br />
Fairy Tail never had a brillant story. But at least it was decent, sometimes even great. Tartaros Arc, for example, had intense battles with very nice characters, and that was more than enough to keep it entertaining.<br />
<br />
The biggest positive point of this manga is its characters (at least when they are developed). Many of them have a very nice background. Zeref, in particular, is a great character, and one of my favourite vilains in recent animes.<br />
<br />
But the new characters, introduced in the Final Arc, go from &quot;meh, nice background&quot; to &quot;utterly garbage worthless character&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Fairy Tail never had great graphics and animation. But the first anime at least had a very nice art style, which made it enjoyable to watch.<br />
The second series had better drawings, but the animation had gotten worse as it was less dynamic.<br />
Now, the Final Series... actually started very well. It&#039;s not great, but the first episodes are actually nice to the eyes (especially the environments, which are great).<br />
But starting from the end of Avatar arc, the art suddenly goes down the hill. It&#039;s mostly still pictures badly drawn!<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
Great seiyuus, great OST (although it has too much remix of the previous OSTs imo).<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTER<br />
I love the characters of Fairy Tail. They&#039;re not the most original, and when they&#039;re not important to the current plot they&#039;re transparent, but despite that, they&#039;re fun to watch.<br />
My favourite is Wendy. She&#039;s the only character who had actual progression. She got stronger and stronger over the arcs, and in this Final Series she really shines as a powerful wizard.<br />
The other characters are... well, the same as usual. Some of them are real badass (Erza in particular), they&#039;re still great to watch in action.<br />
<br />
But most of the new characters are shitty. The Avatar crew was just here to have their asses kicked, I get that but still, did they have to be so... forgettable?<br />
Most of the new main vilains are garbage because they&#039;re beaten quickly and don&#039;t have a story.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
I&#039;m really disappointed in this Final Series. I&#039;m not surprised, but still, it&#039;s a waste of potential for me The first series of this anime is still the best for me. It&#039;s the only one that kept me entertained for hundreds of episodes. The second series disappointed me most of the time, but at least it kept me onboard until the end. This Final Series, however, I&#039;m on the verge of dropping it.<br />
<br />
If you watched the previous series and want to know the end, I really advise to read the manga instead. Sure you&#039;ll miss colors and music, but really, I enjoyed the manga version of these arcs way more than I do their anime version.

    Short version Review wihout spoiler <br />
Fairy tail have taught us many things: <br />
Erza as stronger and anyonning version of sakura<br />
all Fake Death <br />
<br />
Long Version without spoiler <br />
Yay now, Hiro Mashima has finally given up figuring out a creative storyline with creative characters<br />
Hiro Mashima also has his good sides, he can draw well, but he repeats the same and over and over again and again, and the ecchi share is getting bigger. Well, most of his readers want to see and read that as well. But imagine a Hiro Mashima that could write an interesting story + good characters.<br />
And before anyone says anything my name is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review317329">
        not from his main character Fairy Tail that is not the case but that I have for another reason. Do I have to say it here again before people make me aware of it again?<br />
Hiro Mashima can generate fake hypes, and fake deaths in his stories, there is no ultimate consequence and I chalk him just as a negative point. But some of them will contradict me because he is a holy hyped Shonen Mangaka<br />
Honestly a question to the whole fans, is not that somehow on the nerves that ultimately in the whole story of Hiro Mashima be it now Raven, fairytale, Eden zero in itself nothing definitive happens and in the end actually again at the status quo.<br />
As I said, I do not want to be upset or make someone down here, it&#039;s just my observations over the years. This will get a Kishimoto, Oda or even a Kubo with whom I have taken a hard time at the end of Bleach better.<br />
the anime vesion is one piece on dressrosa arc<br />
only camera rides, no movement, no fluid animations,<br />
I had often heard that the anime implementation is so good but there I was grossly deceived yeah and i waiting 3 year for it but<br />
 thank you studio Bridge Inc., A-1 Pictures Inc., CloverWorks<br />
<br />
for this great Work <br />
<br />

    I don&#039;t write reviews, nor do I plan to start.<br />
However I&#039;m just here to say that this is by far one of the worst and laziest seasons of a show that I&#039;ve ever seen. Anyone who legitimately thinks this show is good should automatically be assumed to have terrible taste (which would be the correct assumption); You should never listen to another anime opinion from them again. Even for **Fairy Tail** (which hasn&#039;t even been good since around episode 60), this is bad. <br />
<br />
The &quot;animation&quot; (if it can even be considered that) is literally just still shot after still shot along with incredibly rough art.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review362063">
        In terms of the writing: this arc took two characters that have been built up for almost the entire show and completely throws all the potential they had right out the window. Every character is retarded and just worse versions of themselves then they were in previous arcs. I&#039;m not going to go on because I do not care enough about this dogshit.<br />
<br />
TL;DR what I&#039;m trying to say is that Fairy tail is terrible and isn&#039;t worth the watch.<br />
<br />

    Honestly the story has become very lame and stupid in these past 40 episodes. <br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
We were all expecting new epic enemies, new powers and so much more. But what do we get? Every SINGLE idea they made get thrown out and becomes wasted. It is not Fairy Tail that has gotten stronger, it is the Spriggan 12 that is so embarrassingly weak, that isn&#039;t any real climax for 40 episodes.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Animation seems to be worse but I don&#039;t have much too complain besides the small change in art style again.<br />
<br />
Character: 4/10<br />
I liked that different guilds gets to have their own moment and not have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313317">
        Fairy Tail take all the spotlight to beat a few of the Spriggan 12. But since the enemies are weak anyways there wasn&#039;t really any character development for any of the characters to stand out besides Erza perhaps.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 2/10<br />
It is really hard to enjoy the series now, as most of us who started the first season has already grown up and hates the teamwork and friendship makes the dream work kind of cliche. I personally get bored some times.<br />
<br />
A few words to sum this all up is: too much much much much much PLOT ARMOR armor barrier shield. I really hope this could really change later in the finale.

    do you remember when fairy tail was good series also do you know something when brain dead like me realize there is something wrong with this series you will be sure that this thing is just kinda fucked up at this point <br />
, this season is the worst season in this series so far and there is a lot of reasons why also i love fairy tail but in this season they just destroy everything from the power system to even the characters themselves i tried to not spoil this but i spoiled it anyway because i am mad about how bad this has been

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318127">
        and i need to let you understand why and i will get a lot of hate because this review but i didn&#039;t have any regrets also i don&#039;t have any thing against the fans or series and i just hate this season and think he ruined the whole series (at least for me)  . <br />
<br />
this review will contain a lot of bad words (as fuck) also spoilers so yeah <br />
<br />
&quot;ah shit , here we write again&quot;<br />
<br />
story (1/10) :- <br />
<br />
they kinda fucked it up when it comes to the story and that&#039;s for a lot of reasons and one them is because they kill someone because he seen his mother for the first time and let&#039;s explain more why this thing is fucked up in the erza fight with his mother she destroy big rock that comes from space with one punch and this happened few moments before that happened she can&#039;t <br />
even move or walk !!  , natsu is both demon and dragon so he choose to become a human so now he is a normal wizard am i right ? nope he uses this two power to win in the final fight which is contain natsu vs the strongest black wizard (zaref) who have an endless magic power also this black wizard know all of types of the magic and lived for 400 years !! and he is now lose in battle with normal wizard  in the end if i will talk about all things that fucked up in this season this review will take so long so this is enough as an simple example of how fucked up this story is really is and something else i don&#039;t care about the friendshit power because she is kinda fucked up also and oh i will make this<br />
 <br />
the points when i think the series is kinda got destroyed :- <br />
<br />
- you can come back to life in this series just because someone is die so you will get his life power <br />
<br />
-your love is not enough to kill someone even if you kissed him and had sex with him ? <br />
<br />
-how the time even work ? <br />
<br />
-why there is god slayers when we did&#039;nt see any gods in this series ? <br />
<br />
-you can hear your friends voice when you are far away of then also your sleeping ? <br />
<br />
-spirits i have never heard of them (what are you talking about )  ? <br />
<br />
- you will try to destroy a city then you will stop and die because you have seen your mother for the first time <br />
<br />
- who is the black wizard child ?  <br />
 <br />
art (5/10):- <br />
<br />
in this season the art is kinda so bad in a lot of moments they draw the non face face the face that does&#039;nt have any something to express remember this thing in  the series that depend on expressing the feelings and this art is much worst than the the last season because you will find this non face face a lot in this season at least you will find from 10 to 4 times or maybe more in every ep in this season god damn this what they have done in the last 3 years of me waiting this season and this what i got ? also there no one clip  that can be treated as highly animated in the anime that have a lot of fights , god i wish i will back in time to forget that this season was even coming out because this what 3 years of animation be like  <br />
<br />
sound (10/10) :- <br />
<br />
the only god thing is this season is the osts to honest because they are stay the same and give the same feeling even in this bad season  , i love this ost because he had a lot of feelings from love , hate , fight , family and friendship so it&#039;s very good ost , endings and openings and they have a lot of feelings inside them every time i heard them i remember when fairy was a &quot;good series&quot; <br />
<br />
character (5/10):- <br />
<br />
the new characters does&#039;nt have any personalty at all they just want to kill you for no reason and they also will die for silly reason also some of them just being the one from the strongest wizards in the world and that does&#039;nt mean they can&#039;t be the weakest also and lose in a battle with &quot;normal wizards&quot; from the first time in the series they talked about how strong is this ten wizards is really are until you think one of them can kill all fairy tail members and in this season we know how weak this wizards is really are and now you know that natsu is enough to win vs them all in fight one vs one and this is just silly as fuck  <br />
<br />
enjoyment (2/10) :- <br />
<br />
i say a lot of bad things in this review and the main reason for this because i don&#039;t like when someone just ruined my enjoyment because in the first time i have watched this series i enjoyed a lot in every arc even the weakest arcs i enjoyed them all but this season/arc is just so bad until i can&#039;t even complete the last 2 ep watching this anime become suffering and actions , ,events , story and even feelings just become a joke at this point  i loved fairy tail so much i even watched it every day until i finished it but this season i can&#039;t even watch it every week  <br />
<br />
overall (5/10) :- <br />
<br />
i don&#039;t need to repeat i don&#039;t have anything against the series or the fans but i need to admit i hated this season a lot until i wanted just to forget that i have even watched fairy tail and this season is just a big disappointment not just for me because i discovered when i talked to the other fans that everyone just sow this season as one form the biggest disappointments in anime world as whole i don&#039;t know why there is a lot of good reviews her i am really so confused  is that i am just being toxic hater emo for this series or this series is that bad from the begin and to be honest i feel like i am reviewing my bad feelings for this series instead of writing a really good review but i don&#039;t have any regrets because writing this make me feel more comfortable <br />
<br />
so i am really sorry for all the bad words that i wrote and bye bye <br />
also i forget to say sorry for my bad eng<br />
<br />

    This review was made to provide as little spoilers as possible, therefore I won&#039;t be providing specific examples for my accusations. As you watch the show these flaws will appear. <br />
<br />
They&#039;re back... but wait, are they going to be back forever? Some of you might be asking what this means... I&#039;m talking about the obvious plot armor placed on anyone with the Fairy Tail insignia. This is a horrible decision made by the writing team of the source material. Sure, they can protect the beloved characters of the show to avoid community outrage. However, this move only diminishes the impact of a characters supposed death.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309665">
        What makes the plot armor even more aggravating is that, in the anime, they exaggerate the death to evoke sadness. This tactic worked for the first death as I legitimately felt a feeling of despair. However, all of that was immediately lost when the character came back to life. This paved the way for more characters to &quot;parish&quot; and after the second person was saved by the bell, this completely erased all meaning in character deaths as I just believed that they would return. Furthermore, the characters don&#039;t just die from normal combat causes. They die from heroic feats of courage &quot;sacrificing&quot; themselves for the benefit of their peers. That in itself is beautiful, but they never die, which makes the moment less meaningful. <br />
<br />
Also, pacing is rough around the edges. I understand for an anime of this magnitude they will sometimes sacrifice pacing for income, so I won&#039;t be too critical of them. However, this cannot be ignored. My main gripe is with the formulaic nature of the episodes. They all essentially follow the same layout... slow beginning which remains stagnant, with a possible few moments of action, until we reach the very end of the episode, which is often a cliffhanger. This allows the viewer to really anticipate the next episode, but it makes the overall watching experience slow and boring. Just count how much time character expressions take per episode.<br />
<br />
The whole “power of friendship” is bullshit and is so overused to the point that it just became annoying and childish. <br />
<br />
Overall, this show is a disgrace to its previous seasons with pacing issues, repetitive bullshit and aggressive plot armor placed on characters that detract from the overall potential and enjoyment. <br />
<br />

    Ah, the story of friendship. Through the power of friendship, you can accomplish anything!<br />
That&#039;s what Fairy Tail is, the power of friendship and it&#039;s been the main theme through and through. <br />
<br />
Story: Honestly, I like seeing how they use the power of friendship and camaraderie to figure out how to beat almost anything. The power of nakama is the best thing to watch. However, if you have been watching from the beginning, it&#039;s nice to see why some characters are important to the storyline. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: I mean, who doesn&#039;t like abs that are overdrawn and exaggerated on every male character? The more abs drawn on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307320">
        the character, probably the stronger the character is. You love the oppai? Well, the bigger your oppais stronger your character is as well (but this does not apply to Wendy). Mashima knows what the fans want, and he serves it nicely on the silver platter called fan service. <br />
<br />
Characters: We have seen all the characters develop from the beginning, and this includes others that are not in the guild, because what else can make Fairy Tail a stronger guild? The nakama power they have made with everyone they have met throughout the entire series. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I&#039;ve been watching from the beginning, so yeah, I&#039;m pretty attached to this series. <br />
<br />
Overall: Fairy Tail is exactly what it is, a fairy tale. A fairy tale is a make-believe story that normally has that fairy-tale ending. Fairy Tail might not be a groundbreaking anime, nor is it the anime with the best visuals, however, Fairy Tail lives up to its name as you explore the world of make-believe as you live in the world of what would be fun with dragons, magicians, and any type of magical creature you could think of. <br />

    Story- <br />
Fairy Tail&#039;s Last Arc should have been the best of all arc. But it&#039;s not. In this Arc, there are many characters. They introduced the spriggan 12 and said that each of them has strength similar to GOD SERENA. Zeref said he will put Natsu in bigger despair. But there was no despair or too much of a hurdle.<br />
<br />
Characters-<br />
Unlike Naruto or One Piece, Fairy Tail&#039;s each and every characters are invincible. They do not die in the hands of 10 times stronger enemies. Enemy characters are given overwhelming magic power without any talent on how to use it including ACNOLOGIA. There were some characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309530">
        who didn&#039;t notice enough attention like GOD SERENA.<br />
<br />
Sound-<br />
Soundtracks are nice but sometimes voice actors voices just don&#039;t match the situation. Other than that, everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-<br />
Not enjoyable as the fighting moments are boring. The animation is very slow and sluggish.

    The first 2 seasons were fine but not the best. But this final season is so random, it&#039;s like they ran out of ideas and kept putting whatever comes to their mind. Too many characters and too many meaningless twists that will make your brain hurt. At one point I stopped reading the subtitle because it is pointless, just fights and cliches of deriving your power from your friends. <br />
I was hopping to see more development on the romantic side of the story, but the magakas decided to keep it silly and cringe-worthy, the ending is bad and not interesting at all. <br />
I had to

    This season, especially the Alvarez arc, is much better than the others in terms of character motivations (particularly that of Zeref), which the other arcs (like the Tenrou Island arc [Hades had no character-driven reason to seek out the Grand Magic World], lacked). <br />
<br />
It does contain quite a lot of plot armor and deus ex machina moments (like Ultear showing up to save Wendy and Shelia out of nowhere and Natsu magically recovering from his coma) and crappy fight sequences (like ruining the tension of the fight for a stupid nudity joke in the Jacob fight).<br />
<br />
I would recommend this season to fans of the previous

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303338">
        seasons. It&#039;s unlikely that newer fans will enjoy this season (or this show) since most of the humor used is in the same style as the shonen series of the 2000s (or, to put it in another way, overly reliant on slapstick and immature punchlines).<br />
<br />
Overall, this season does make some major improvements on the previous seasons and I think you should definitely give it a try if you enjoy shonen battle series.

    People have been talking shit about Fairy Tail ever since it was serialized and eventually turned into an anime in the late 2000s.  They called it a &quot;poor man&#039;s One Piece&quot; and not investing. While I do agree there were and remain too much plot armor and PLOT, the Final Series is definitely the highest peak of the entire show. It maintains the great music and character that was introduced in the first season, while also looking even more fantastic with better fightscenes than the already improved (artistically) Fairy Tail 2014. The Final Series contains the raw emotions of the main cast, as well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302297">
        as Zeref and the Spriggan 12, and fixes numerous plot holes and answers questions fans have been waiting for since the show first started (if you haven&#039;t read the manga). Also Natsu and the rest of the cast are way more bad ass this time, as they trained for a year in order to prepare for this final showdown (not including the 100 years quest). This is the best way to end the series that has captivated us for years on end. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because of the art. The art itself is the best the show has ever looked, however, fight scenes still are pretty static with not a lot of fluent animation (it will probably get better since the first third of the show was animated around the same time the second season was coming to an end, so the last episodes will be looking the best). To add to this, Sword Art Online: Alicitization, and other concurrent A-1 Pictures/Cloverworks animes look better than Fairy Tail, with movements, even though they are using the same animation and production teams. Besides this, Fairy Tail: Final Series is fantastic and  makes you fall in love with the characters again as they win battles, struggle , suffer losses and do everything they can to protect their family, their guild, Fairy Tail. I wish they turn the 100 Year Quest into an anime, but they most likely won&#039;t.
