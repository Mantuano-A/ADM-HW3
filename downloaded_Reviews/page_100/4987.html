Ever seen a buddy cop film? This is a love letter to the subgenre, and it turns out, buddy cop plus moe is a match made in heaven. The key premise of a buddy cop film is forcing two very different people to work together - anime allows these people to be as different as a gruff veteran detective and a space elf loli jedi. They’re supposed to bicker - so we get angry loli pouts and a despairing guy too old for this shit. “Fish out of water” -

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318756">
        we get treated to a curious inquisitive daughteru interacting with the modern world. None of that, of course, gets in the way of the pure cop drama goodness - you still get all the “getting shot two days before retirement”, “investigation leading to a strip club” and “the FBI rolling in and taking over” that your heart desires. <br />
<br />
Juxtaposition is also a hell of a drug. Sword and sorcery stuff happening against the backdrop of the criminal underbelly of Not Los Angeles makes up for a unique, eye-catching setting. The world-building, the characters, the comedy and dialogue writing are quality stuff you can expect from Gatoh Shoji (Full Metal Panic and Amagi Brilliant Park creator). Special mention for a western setting that actually feels western.<br />
<br />
On the story front - despite being an adaptation of a novel series, it isn’t just “stuff happens until it doesn’t.&#039;&#039; It feels like an actual story that begins with the first episode and ends with the last. The last two episodes work as the culmination of every major arc that happened up until that point.<br />

There is an unavoidable fact that the animation is very lacking due to a blatantly tight budget (which in practical terms means the deficit of manpower), but the show does an amazing job of working around its limitations with clever editing/shot composition. In fact, this series is a great illustration of the fact that animation/sakuga (the amount of movement, the number of frames per second, etc) has very little to do with how good a show actually looks. For example, there is one scene of a car crossing over the hill, and it’s literally a cutout of the car moving against a static background, with the front wheels just going up into the skies. It looks bizarre… until the scene changes and you see the car’s suspension violently smashing down from a jump. The front wheels did, in fact, go into the skies, what you saw is what happened in-universe. A tiny studio pulling every trick in the book to make up for the lack of resources is to be commended, especially when the very same season we can see an inverse of that with Fire Force - the cream-of-the-crop animator talent being wasted on terrible visual direction.<br />
Even bigger flaw is a bizarre episode structure of the first arc which makes it look like a movie that just got cut into 25 minute chunks - a culmination of an entire arc happens basically in a pre-credits scene, while the rest of the episode starts a new arc. Again, it appears to be a consequence of simply not having enough animators and being forced to do 2.25 episodes out of what was supposed to be 3.<br />
Anyway, what I am getting at, why is a show with such flaws is rated 10? It isn’t, I’d take out 0,1 points for bad animation and 0,3 points for the episode structure, so the final score of the show would be 9.6/10. There is no way in hell I’d feel justified subtracting more because neither random junky frames, nor the other thing detract in a meaningful way from story, dialogues, humor and ideas that together make up 96% of my enjoyment of this show. If other people are incapable of appreciating those things and resort to focusing on other aspects, such as production values - it’s their loss.<br />
<br />
9.6/10 for “unique, thought-provoking and entertaining piece of fiction.”<br />

    I don’t consider myself easy to impress, and harbor a considerable amount of skepticism when it comes to anime in particular. The state of the industry and Japan’s own questionable ethics more often than not lead to incomplete adaptations, overreliance on tropes, tendency to pander, and plenty other undesirable practices in the medium.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, anime as a medium has yet to evolve to the level of films or literature, and as such I choose to keep my expectations rather low with every coming season. Sure, you have your hard-hitters like Vinland Saga and Demon Slayer, but then there’s the expected boatload of isekai, or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318773">
        series with potential but fall into mediocrity--for me and plenty of others, To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts was one such show. And even then, the hard-hitters often are not something I personally find enthralling, since they tend to fall under specific tropes palatable to very young teenagers; or as we call them, shounen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m onboard with that every once in a while, but there’s only so much of it I can take before a medium of seemingly endless potential and imagination begins to feel surprisingly safe and sterile.<br />
<br />
To be clear, I’m not trying to diss anime as a whole. Plenty other mediums have their own problems, especially in their infancy period. Anime is a medium I love and support, and as such I’m all too aware of the drawbacks I’ve come to expect while digging my way through the depths in search of anime that are true standouts. And it’s because of this that the level of enjoyment I had watching Cop Craft is truly precious. If you’re like me, you’ve certainly had reservations or mixed feelings about Cop Craft’s reveal, particularly in the context of Japan’s ever-so-uncomfortable liking for small girls. Some of those same people went on to be pleasantly surprised, just like I was, at its first episode. As for me alone, I kept watching to where it would become one of my most cherished anime in recent memory.<br />
<br />
My love for crime-focused shows and films akin to Lethal Weapon, The Sopranos, and the like had sold me on the show within minutes. After some more time of watching, I was then engrossed by the character chemistry and splendid dialogue. And with wild supernatural elements, fantastical concepts, and bizarre sci-fi all welded cohesively into a thrilling buddy-cop drama, Cop Craft stands as another showcase of what anime as a medium, compared to live-action, is truly capable of pulling off.<br />
<br />
Before I go any further, however, I must address the elephant in the room. Yes, this show has serious problems with its production, which many people are aware of due to the damaging effect it&#039;s had on animation and pacing. Cop Craft&#039;s overall quality undeniably suffers as a result, but I feel like people should know the whole context of why this show is the way it is. I’ll go much deeper into this later on, but the basic story is this: this show was made with the passion of a driven and talented team in a very small studio with budget constraints and scheduling issues; a project far too ambitious for what the team is capable of doing. As a result, the animation quality is a horribly mixed bag, but this should not be attributed to laziness of the staff, as tempting as that is. As pressing of a topic as this is, I want to save it for later in this review. As of now I want to make the point that poor production is a tragic reality of what is otherwise a fantastic experience.<br />
<br />
The dynamic between Kei Matoba and Tilarna Exedilika is the essence of what makes Cop Craft such a worthwhile experience. The incessant passive-aggressive remarks between the grouchy nihilistic cop and the spoiled, ill-tempered young rookie is one of few aspects of their interplay that makes their first several hours together so immediately riveting. Not only is their interplay superbly written, varied, and sometimes comedic, they’re highly fleshed out characters whose relationship evolves from a bitter incompatibility to a dubious comradery. In general, Kei is someone who doesn’t get along with people, which is understandable since he’s one of the last people you’d ever want to hang out with. He’s a callous and largely inconsiderate man, making rude or judgemental comments towards people regularly with no signs of remorse. But he is not without a heart, as much as he tries to hide that fact from Tilarna. A man of few words, his sparse acts of kindness and courtesy are often dubious, with his true intentions left concealed in his own frigid mist of a personality. Even his most notable good deed, rescuing and adopting a stray cat after pursuing a perp, is reasoned with the idea of it being selfish instead of altruistic, saying he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if he left the cat there.<br />
<br />
While ostensibly uncaring, Kei clearly has humanity as shown in his outrage over the death of his partner, Rick (which, by the way, happens within the first few minutes of the first episode, so no spoilers there), and the fact that he views his chief, Jack Roth, as a father figure. Likewise, it’s made obvious that in spite of his bitterness towards Tilarna, he does grow to care for her. His dialogue with her later on walks a fine line, making it uncertain which of his lines are playful, complementary, sarcastic, or tough love. In general, Kei appeals to the part of us that wants to be spared of the nonsense and get the task out of the way. His cold attitude is admittedly hard to tolerate at points, especially when he shows no gratitude whatsoever for when Tilarna saves his life, but that’s just part of what makes him so endearing. Kei and Tilarna’s rough interactions are what makes their sparse cases of growing closer all the more meaningful.<br />
<br />
Tilarna is always aiming to uphold her dignity and her moral code, making sure to never stray from either goal, excluding particular circumstances. Yet she’s also prudish and naive compared to Kei, often used to great comedic effect and is crucial to her development in much later arcs. Similar to Kei, her abrasiveness towards him isn’t exactly reflective of her actual feelings. More than anything, she just wants to feel respected by Kei and not be treated like a burden, which is an understandable frustration for anyone having to work with the man for so long. With such an entertaining banter between well-realized characters whose bond develops with every few episodes, topped with brilliant dialogue, Kei and Tilarna end up being one of the most compelling duos in anime I’ve ever had the pleasure of following.<br />
<br />
On another note, it’s strange and disappointing to see the stereotypical depiction of gay characters that plagues Japanese media appear in Cop Craft--by which I’m referring to Tony. Funnily enough, I initially approved of his character as I assumed *he* was a transgender woman. Because transphobia is just as much of a problem in Japan, my first impression of Tony was a pleasant surprise. And I was let down upon finding out that Tony isn’t a transgender, but a very effeminite and flamboyant gay man. Generally, his appearance and character alone isn’t all that big of a deal. But it does get a lot more off-putting with that one scene of Tony subconsciously feeling up a teenager only to be stopped by Aleks; and wiping drool off of his face as an added bonus. Although Tony is portrayed more tastefully than the likes of Puri Puri Prisoner from One Punch Man, they&#039;re both still sad reminders of how long of a way Japan as yet to go in terms of proper LGBT representation in media.<br />
<br />
This is a real shame since Tony is generally a good character apart from this, alongside his detective buddy Aleksandr, both of which are a treat to watch thanks to Cop Craft’s sheer aptitude with dialogue and comedy. And then there’s police chief Bill Zimmer, who is just about the closest to an anime Samuel L. Jackson since Afro Samurai. Although his spitting rage and humorous lines are a joy to witness, and with how respectable he was in speaking favorably of Tilarna towards a racist subordinate, Zimmer isn’t one of the more fleshed out characters of the show, unlike the doctor and ex-girlfriend of Kei, Cecil Epps. While it’s shocking to see someone actually put up with Kei’s rudeness, and even remain friends with the man, the main draw of Cecil’s character is how easily she befriends Tilarna. The friendship between the two feels genuine, with Cecil consoling Tilarna about difficult tasks and personal woes. Their playful dialogue about Kei also leads to one of the funniest moments I’ve ever seen in an anime. A lesser writer would simply use Cecil as a plot device or to flesh out Kei’s history, but she’s given the humanity needed to make her truly feel like a person with a physical presence in the overall narrative. With such an engaging main duo alongside almost equally great side characters, Cop Craft boasts one of the strongest casts of characters of any anime I’ve seen in recent memory.<br />
<br />
This setup for a buddy cop show is hardly a unique one, especially to those well-acquainted with Western TV and films, but it does stand out in the anime medium among its contemporaries at the very least. And besides, execution is everything. And Cop Craft’s execution in its story is as great as one could ever hope.<br />
<br />
As we’re welcomed to the fictional city of San Teresa, we venture into the unknown as well as the familiar. Conflict is abundant here as any Earth-dweller would expect a city to be, but the presence of the Semaani race brings forth a plethora of surprises among the crime scenes and detective cases, imparting a fantastical and arcane flavor to the adventure rarely seen in a police drama. With roughly 15 years of interaction with humans, the Semanians and their world is still largely alien to its human neighbors, with many discoveries to be made about them and what bizarre occurrences and fields of magic, or ‘Latena’ as it’s called, could be at play. To be a policeman in San Teresa means to expect the unexpected, a mantra that would benefit the viewer just as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, constantly throwing surprises at the viewer runs the risk of making the world feel incohesive and random, but these ideas are well-developed and properly built up to thanks to some impeccable world-building and (for the most part) remarkable pacing. The true depths of Semaani reveals itself little by little in the human world, pacing out these discoveries in such a way that provides intrigue and tension in a near-perfect manner. It also helps that Semanian arts have a logical presence as opposed to simple magic. Aside from the admittedly far-fetched “strong feelings create Latena” thing, practices and contraptions of Semanians operate on rules of their own, much like our technology. Perhaps the author, Shoji Gatou, was given a freebie by age-old concepts in Western fantasy when creating the Semanian race, but this world is so fleshed out to where it’s given an identity of its own. Semanians even have their own language, which when spoken sounds remarkably elegant and refined, unlike numerous other fictional languages such as Parseltongue of Harry Potter which sounds vague and almost like gibberish. To show just how refined this language is, aside from apparently being learnable, it’s worth considering Tilarna’s uttering of “Boliceman.” This is made to be an endearing quirk, but it also gives the implication that the Semaani language likely lacks a ‘p’ sound, with ‘b’ as a common substitute.<br />
<br />
After some time, the role of exploring a foreign world is passed over to Tilarna. Here we have the pleasure of watching Tilarna trying to cope with and adapt to facets of our planet Earth--specifically, pornography and vehicles of transportation--all bundled into an episode’s worth of hilarity, enticing chaos, and a grace of character bonding at the very end. It’s easily one of the most enjoyable episodes of anything in recent memory, as well as the few cases of anime humor making me laugh out loud. This is an episode that lingers in my memory continually, which is a very high honor to hold.<br />
<br />
A prominent facet of the setting is how the world of Semaani interacts with that of Earth. The many fields of Latena originating from Semaani unsurprisingly can accomplish certain tasks in a way that human technology cannot. And surprisingly, the opposite is also true. Coding, hacking, firearms, automobiles, photography, and night vision goggles are what the world of Semaani lacks, and play an equally vital role in snuffing out the perpetrator.<br />
<br />
Obviously the aptitude of your arsenal means little if the one using it lacks competence, as evident in many shounen and seinen that get away with artificially stretching out their arcs by having characters fumble around or arbitrarily bringing forth a greater power to stall the action. Cop Craft is the exact opposite case. The policemen of San Teresa are intelligent and capable as policemen are expected to be, using any strategy or asset at their disposal to gain the upper hand. I think anyone could remember a time they watched or read a piece of media, getting aggravated at characters for not seeing the obvious solution or making moronic decisions leading to their downfall, taking you out of the experience. Cop Craft almost never stumbles upon this, and crimes are dealt with efficiently through the use of Latena magic, Earth technology, and competent storytelling.<br />
<br />
That said, as praiseworthy as this is, it comes with a cost: conflicts in Cop Craft are dealt with relatively fast, and arcs can feel frustratingly brief and even anticlimactic as a result. Some could frame all this as a negative, but it ultimately depends on what you look for in an action show. I for one couldn’t be happier with how Cop Craft chose to execute this. The overall narrative of Cop Craft is akin to that of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, and not just with its Western influences. It spends a brief enough time on an idea so as to throw a new one on the table. Cop Craft never gives anything a chance to get boring (excluding the fan-hated episode 8). Each arc is expounded upon enough to be satisfying in its own right, with the resolution feeling authentic and plausible rather than climactic.<br />
<br />
Apart from human tech and Latena, the interaction between Semanians and humans leaves sociological effects that are intriguing and applicable to reality. Heavy politics are in full force as would be expected in a city of mixed races, and Cop Craft is incredibly bold and proficient with this direction, especially for an anime--granted, it involves a fictional race, but the point stands. Multiple points of view regarding the presence of Semanians are touched upon and come into play during a much later arc, lending more weight and authenticity to an already fascinating world. A simple biased aversion towards Semanians or humans for what they are is obviously just racism, but one character in particular has a far more elaborate and justified viewpoint that comes from a similar place, whose quote is written below:<br />
<br />
<br />
“Coexistence, peace...just lies idealists tell. Earthlings and aliens can’t ever get along. We must keep apart.”<br />
<br />
“Some of them are getting by just fine!”<br />
<br />
“And their ability to adapt is what scares me. Look at their strength, their vitality; in three generations they’ll usurp us and rule the Earth! The invasion will be over before anyone notices. Yes, not even the invaders are aware of what they’re doing. The world needs to wake up and see just how dangerous these Semanians are.”<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve watched Cop Craft up to a certain point, you definitely know who these quotes are from, and where this exchange transpires. For spoiler reasons, I won’t say, but the crux of the matter is the ideology of what is said here. This is clearly in line with most conservative views regarding immigration; a fear that there is more to lose than to gain, and results can be disastrous. Obviously there are different viewpoints on immigration and I don’t wish to have this sort of discussion at the moment when it comes to real life issues, but Cop Craft is commendable in bringing this predicament to light in a setting where it fits like a glove.<br />
<br />
For a 12-episode season, it would be wrong of me to say that these issues are explored to their fullest, but that’s all the more reason to consider the ongoing status of the source material, and to acknowledge that the anime only covers a portion of what is, or will be, in the full story. If anything, this is a positive way of looking at the studio’s size. Since their budget is so small, there’s a relatively greater chance of Cop Craft making a good profit, thus hopefully leading to a second season being made.<br />
<br />
What’s really admirable in regards to the studio’s size is just how well the team could do in spite of such meager production. While Cop Craft’s animation is limited, the overall aesthetic is a feast for the eyes. While the show lacks in frames, it excels through well-directed framing and glorious attention to detail. The open nocturnal suburbs are coated in a softly-lit patch of neon colors, contrasting with the grim and subdued tones of the alleyways where conflict is sure to erupt. Bloom lighting is applied constantly in places to accentuate the bright urban life. Most indoor areas are rendered in modest colors where bloom lighting is sparingly used, creating a calm environment where the brutality of police work is given a rest. With such limited resources, the team has made a show that is not only pretty to look at, but with effective theming for different environments. All of this is to say, Cop Craft is one of those cases where the art is superb, but the animation is lacking--hopefully the anime community will finally know the difference between the two.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Cop Craft’s visuals, there’s no getting by without mentioning the action scenes, which are of particularly low quality past the second episode. This is where the studio’s size is made all too clear. However, lack of animation isn’t exactly the only thing holding back the action scenes, and this is an area where people are most inclined to blame the director. So here’s the way I see it: is the director, Shin Itagaki, at fault for Cop Craft’s shoddy action scenes?<br />
<br />
My answer is: yes and no.<br />
<br />
Shin Itagaki is an enigma of the anime industry. You might construe that as a word of praise but that’s literally what he is. Shin Itagaki is the director of shows like Basquash!, Ben-To, Teekyuu, and of course the infamous Berserk 2016/17. On top of being a director, Itagaki is also a freelance animator, sometimes doing his own work during production, and an extreme perfectionist. When discussing the animation quality of Cop Craft, an important thing to consider is that Shin Itagaki has a rather unusual way of directing fight scenes, putting more emphasis on impact than spatial awareness. This sort of style favors very dynamic camera angles and frames of impact, constantly breaking the 180-degree rule of cinema which all results in an action scene that feels visceral yet lacks sense of place. Cop Craft is consistently animated in 3s, and most of its action scenes are animated similarly to the likes of Studio Trigger, with limited frames, heavy smearing, and very dynamic pose-to-pose action facilitating impact in a way that fluidity cannot. However, with such wild storyboarding and constant breaking of the 180-degree rule, higher frames are a must for the scene to flow properly, and Cop Craft is proof enough of how much this can backfire.<br />
<br />
To see just how well Itagaki’s action can turn out, look no further than Ben-To. Fight scenes in Ben-To, as well as certain ones in Cop Craft, are evident of just how much increased frames make the difference with this style, creating enough flow between scenes that would otherwise end up disorienting and drain the scene of its tension. With the current state Millepensee is in, it seems most wise to ditch such strenuous methods and stick to basic, conventional fight choreography to make do with what little frames there are to work with. In the case of Cop Craft, this would have been the better approach in plenty of cases. Many scenes would have worked much better with the same amount of frames but different storyboards, but it seems that Itagaki is hellbent on sticking with his vision no matter what, making demands that the studio just isn’t able to meet.<br />
<br />
This really hurts the anime in the long run, and it’s incredibly tragic. But there’s a reason I’m not putting so much scrutiny on this front. And it’s that I fully expect the DVD releases to amend this. Itagaki is clearly a very ambitious, passionate individual, and along with his team would love to take any opportunity to make this project exactly how they wanted to. For some episodes it’s not a huge deal if not many changes are made, but as for episodes 3, 5, and 10, Millepensee would be insane to not give them a makeover when the chance comes. Those episodes are infamous for containing some of the worst action in the series, with episode 3 commonly remembered as one of the most shocking dips in quality an anime has ever suffered. But I have faith in Itagaki and all of Millepensee, and wish them nothing but the best.<br />
<br />
Cop Craft, you deserve better. You deserved a bigger budget, you deserved better management, you deserve more attention, you deserve more support, and above all things else, you deserve a second season. This fascinating world, these splendid characters, the intriguing storytelling; Cop Craft is a project that is clearly too ambitious for what the studio is actually capable of, and it’s my earnest wish that the BDs improve upon this significantly, as it’s their one chance at polishing this product into what they truly wanted it to be. The heart is there, the team is competent, and the tremendous quality of the source material is for us to experience on a small screen. While I hardly ever excuse poor production, this is a team that deserves our sympathy and support. The story of Cop Craft feels like it’s only just begun, and I’m fully on board with what more adventures await our duo, as well as how much higher the studio will go from what is their biggest project yet.

    Cop Craft made me question what happens if Blood Blockade Battlefront had a brother or sister. While they share some of resemblance of its other from their base premise, Cop Craft certainly stands out to be its own series. Taking place in a gritty underworld setting, this is the type of show I didn’t know if I wanted to see again.<br />
<br />
Are you a fan of storytelling with a buddy cop style formula? If so, Cop Craft will probably be a treat with the amount of character dynamics. There’s certain level of character interactions that will get you comfortable with its first opening episodes. Make no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318754">
        mistake though, Cop Craft itself is meant to be taken seriously although its execution of humor can be questionable. I’ll get to that later but the first two episodes hit the right marks to make a favorable impression. We meet main protagonists Kei and Tilarnia after a strange encounter and it sets the tone of the main story. This pair stands out as the most important character duo as they tackle on the challenges in this dark metropolis.<br />
<br />
One of the more fascinating element of the show revolves around the strange premise itself. The story blends fiction and reality together in what should be described as a police procedural drama. In the present timeline, Teresa City is filled with crime. It’s like the type of city where you’ll see chaos erupting from weapon trafficking, drugs, prostitution, and even murder. Based on the light novel of the same name, some of these concepts doesn’t entirely surprise me. Shoji Gatoh (author of Full Metal Panic!) has been known to craft work with police drama. Cop Craft relies heavily on its insider ideas and main character duo. Unfortunately, the main storytelling itself is very loose and sometimes, I find that it lacks a general purpose. By the time this show almost concluded, I pretty much accepted the fact that the plot wasn’t going to improve. At least we have the main characters carrying this anime, right?<br />
<br />
Kei is a human cop. He fights the good fight in this dark city while Tilarnia is the sidekick and partner. Imagine a strange alternate world where Full Metal Panic’s Sousuke and Chidori became detectives. Somehow, I picture Kei and Tilarnia in similar roles. There’s no doubt the pair has character chemistry despite their vastly contrasting differences. Humorous gags also occur between the two although over time, it feels more and more redundant than being actual funny. Coming from different backgrounds, there’s a mediocre appeal about both characters individually. It seems the pair’s character dynamics work best when they are together. When apart, I quickly find myself losing interest in what they’re doing. In some episodes, the anime also likes to poke fun of Tilarnia’s weak common sense and alludes to adult humor. The lack of character development doesn’t help either to get invested into either character. It’s a shame really since both Kei and Tilarnia could have been what holds this anime together. When you begin to lose hope for its main cast, there’s not much room for improvement. Unfortunately, most of the side characters hold little relevance. I honestly can’t even remember most of their names out of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Putting the drawbacks aside, I do think Cop Craft had a wealth of ideas to be something special. The main problem is the execution. It’s difficult to get invested into the plot when the mood changes from frame to frame nearly every episode. The plot structure also has a ‘monster of the week’ like format where some sort of crime needs to be solved. It does reinforce the dark side of the city with its underworld activities. But when the show lacks a general purpose, it quickly wears itself out and loses significance. The character development is almost non-existent with every episode spitting out random events rather than a concentrated focus. With each progressing episode, I felt like the show loses more of its relevance. The anime is only 12 episodes and according to some content I’ve heard, there’s pacing issues too. Coming in as an anime only viewer, it’s a major disappointment from what Cop Craft could have been.<br />
<br />
However, that’s not the end of its problems. Even on a technical level, Cop Craft suffers production issues in later episodes. From an early example (episode 3), you can tell that the animation quality drops with lackluster battle sequences. It doesn’t help the anime also has to rely on some rather strange fan service at times to do the talking. Somehow, Tilurna’s character ends up becoming a source of animal jokes in one particular episode. Desperate as it seems, it’s the type of fan service that basically shows it has nothing else to say. Luckily, the world setting itself has a decent amount of creativity. The dark metropolis contains a degree of realism despite the fantasy content. It reminds me of Los Angeles with a wealth of cultural ideas and social problems.<br />
<br />
Ah Cop Craft. I wish I read the light novels beforehand so I limited my expectations. The first two episodes made a strong impression but quickly begins to wear itself out with its charm. The main character duo delivers popcorn entertainment but it doesn’t manage to fully make the show itself entertaining. If you don’t mind the cheeky humor or bland storytelling, then this may turn out to be a treat for you. For me personally, this is one of those anime that lost steam and never looked back. <br />

    Now I know there are plenty of pretentious people out there, who would pass this because of its unquestionable shortcomings. As of writing this review I&#039;ve seen 4 episodes and everything about the show that feels cliche, overdone or stupid, I&#039;ve managed to turn around in my head, just because this show gives me absolute pure enjoyment. From the stile to the music, to the chemistry between the characters, that perfectly compliment&#039;s their differences, to the music again and to all the things that should feel annoying in the plot and the plot devices, but actually surprise you with how stupid, abrupt and ridiculous they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314288">
        are. I always complain that if I know what is about to happen in the story, and how the writers are going to present it, I won&#039;t enjoy it. But here it is not the story that I enjoy. it&#039;s the ful package. I even consider the undyingly crappy animation as a reason to like this show, because in this messed up world everything is messed up, and the fight to the death isn&#039;t the important part, instead, it&#039;s the reaction of the characters to that fight. I don&#039;t need gorgeously animated action sequences. That&#039;s why I watch kimetsu no yaiba for. And that show always annoys me with its lack of focus. Cop Craft might as well be my favourite show this season, as almost all lines of dialogue are poetically comedic, either when they play on cliches and mock overused tropes, or when the characters simply interact. I like it when the plot, the characters, the premise are complex and thought out, but I absolutely love the simple style and approach in this show. The reason for that is that I simply like it.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this is not an action thriller for me. Instead, I like to think of it as an overproduced comedy, that works perfectly as a comedy. I consider Cop Craft nothing less of a gem, because unlike Enen no Shouboutai for example, where I keep thinking what could have been done with the story and in what ways, here I just purely enjoy the ride without a care in the world. Every episode is a case of &quot;Will they make it, will they survive?&quot; - &quot;Of course they will, now shut up and watch&quot;. I might sound really dumb, but I can hardly criticise a show that makes me laugh so much.<br />
In that regard, it is similar to KONOSUBA, which basically has no concurrent story or plot, but is hilarious and funny in the stupidest ways imaginable. IDK. If you want to give Cop Craft a chance, just don&#039;t think about the bad or the ugly, focus on the stupid and the &quot;oh, for fuck&#039;s sake, really???&quot; moments of it. It won&#039;t surprise you if you are looking for something unique in its own right, but if you just sit down and watch I promise you&#039;ll have a great time.

    Cop Craft is a Japanese light novel series, which was written by Shoji Gatoh (Amagi Brilliant Park)and illustrated by Range Murata (Last Exile). Six volumes have been published by Shogakukan so far since November 2009. An anime television series adaptation by Millepensee (Berserk, Teekyuu ) premiered on July 8, 2019. The final episode aired on September 30, 2019 and concluded 12 episodes series.<br />
<br />
15 years ago, an unknown portal opened over the Pacific, leading to an alternative world, called Reto Semaani, to the world, where fairies and demons live. Because of that, San Teresa City is now flooded with immigrants from the parallel world. Of course,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318757">
        neither of the worlds is perfect, so crime starts to thrive with the new types of fraud, drugs, and weapons able to destroy a whole country that are so small that no security service will ever notice. San Teresa City is the place where you can get everything, or lose everything; this is the city of big dreams. The story of Cop Craft focuses on a rather unusual detectives&#039; duo, trying to keep peace in the city: the detective Kei Matoba and the alternate-world knight Tirana. The two are so different that reaching an understanding is problematic sometimes. Nevertheless, they both have their own pride-- to eradicate the crime in the city of San Teresa.<br />

For decades, a duo of cops, detectives, or simple civilians, trying to solve a case have been a tried and true formula not only in cinema, but also in literature. There are plenty titles in anime, too. Such titles as: Jin Rou, Psycho-Pass and Ghost in the Shell will, of course, ring a bell. However, the question is, can Cop Craft even be as good as the trio, or does it, at least, have something new to offer? And the answer to this question is that Cop Craft is worth your while, if you are a fan of the genre. It is does have fantasy and magic in its genres, but, at the same time, it looks somewhat realistic. Let us omit magic and the city of San Teresa looks like a reality that might happen one day. On top of that, Cop Craft focuses on a duo of Cops, who are absolutely different from each other: the language, the ideals, the way they fight, they gender, everything is different. Yet, there is one thing, one desire that makes them closer than anyone else-- they want to eradicate crime. And the way the story-line develops, the way it shows all the possible frustration of Tilarna&#039;s in a new world, she knows nothing about is quite enjoyable. One would argue, however, that the story-line does not pay enough attention to Kei&#039;s and Tilarna&#039;s backgrounds, which might have made it more interesting, or maybe boring. With that being said, the story-line of Cop Craft, while not perfect, manages to answer the needed questions and to offer enough development to understand the main conflict of the series.<br />
<br />
Animation wise, it is fine. Although, in 2019 you would expect a better animation, and it is also somewhat obvious that Cop Craft sometimes makes a focus in animation on some scenes and pays little to no attention to others, it is still good. In addition to this, one would expect &#039;aliens&#039; to look more unique. In Cop Craft, however, one of the main antiheroes, who is a human, looks more unique than any other aliens. Sound wise, it is simply great. Not only that both English and Japanese dubs are as enjoyable, but also Cop Craft has an OST composed by Taku Iwasaki, you must know the name. A genius, making pieces that amazingly fit any series, he is responsible for. Cop Craft is no exception, which gets a pretty enjoyable OST that helps to enjoy the series.<br />
<br />
Character wise, the series focuses on the cop duo, consisting of: Tirana Exedirika and Matoba Kei. Tirana is a knight from a parallel world. She has little to no understanding about how the earth police work and that you actually cannot kill a criminal. She does not like Matoba, at first, but later starts to appreciate his dedication to work and his views. Kei Matoba used to be a soldier, now a detective sergeant for the San-Teresa Metropolitan Police and Tirana&#039;s partner. Important thing to mention is that Cop Craft characters offer enough development. The moment they duo starts working together, they, let us say, do not appreciate one another: they make fun of each other, try to act independently and just cannot stand each other. But as the series progresses, the duo, actually, understands that they both are trying to fight against the bad guys and it does not matter, where you are from and how your ears look like; they become just like Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash, ready to help one another, ready to risk one&#039;s life. And to look how they interact and care for each other is very enjoyable. My biggest regret, however, is that this show has no strong antihero, who would have made both the story-line and characters more interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment wise, I did enjoy Cop Craft. From everything it has to offer, it is nearly perfect cop series. However, one major &#039;but&#039;, I hated about this series is fan service. It is not that annoying and it does not appear that often for me to say that this series is ruined because of that, or something like that. But my problem is that you are trying to watch a serious series, or something that is trying to be such, Cop Craft fails in many ways, which you will see in the 8th episode. That is, of course, not that much of a problem, but it is an obvious mistake to make such sudden shift in the series&#039; tone.<br />
<br />
Overall, Cop Craft is still worth your while, because of its unusual look on cop duos. Definitely it will not be something you would call a mind-blowing experience, because of the fan-service (which is only in a few episodes) and some things, the story-line does not focus on (it is only a minor flaw), it is still enjoyable. For those who hate fan service, I highly recommend to quickly skip episode 8.<br />
<br />
With episode 8: 7/10; Without episode 8: a very weak 8/10.

    ·Story: 6/10<br />
<br />
The plot of this anime is similar to other anime&#039;s plots, but in this case it&#039;s focused on a police genre, which is the reason why I gave it a 6.<br />
<br />
The story isn&#039;t too original from what I&#039;ve seen as many of the episodes are simple typical cases of the police genre but with that touch of fantasy that characterizes this anime.<br />
<br />
·Art: 3/10<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t be so severe in this part, but I have to say that the art of this anime is really poor. Fight scenes are cut, yes, in some scenes they are literally an static image. <br />
<br />
This is what reduces it&#039;s mark

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314160">
        a lot, also normal scenes aren&#039;t the best quality they could be, for me they seem to have been made &#039;&#039;fast and with no energies?&#039;&#039;. <br />
<br />
·Sound: 7/10<br />
<br />
The general sound is good, what made me put a 7 and not a 6 was it&#039;s opening, which reminds me of that typical old style. <br />
<br />
Also, music is pretty good, although there are some scenes that don&#039;t coordinate with the audio.<br />
<br />
·Character: 5/10<br />
<br />
The characters in my opinion aren&#039;t good enough. What I mean with this?<br />
<br />
As far as I have seen the personality of the characters hasn&#039;t been defined really well, I will change my mind if I see that this changes in the next episodes but by far I will keep my 5.<br />
<br />
·Enjoyment: 5/10<br />
<br />
The combination of the bad art with the &#039;&#039;typical&#039;&#039; plot and the bad sound sometimes really makes it&#039;s enjoyment really hard. <br />
<br />
I consider that with some changes would be much better, especially in the quality of the art in the fight scenes, which I consider the most important part of a police genre anime.<br />
<br />
·Overall: 5/10<br />
<br />
In general, is a mediocre anime. I hope it gets better with the time! <br />
<br />
Thank for reading! :D<br />

    I&#039;ll start by saying that it&#039;s a shame that this show is airing when it is; any other season than right now and I think it would do a lot better for itself. Unfortunately, it&#039;s up against hard hitters like Fire Force and Demon Slayer, and I think as a result that both reduces its popularity and makes people more critical towards it, especially when you consider the quality of the aforementioned shows and others.<br />
<br />
Starting with flaws, the story itself is fairly average, with several generic character and story tropes thrown in. Because of this, it makes it a lot harder for this show to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review315153">
        stand out among its competitors, and it may not be interesting enough to keep some people interested in it. It also may limit what will be able to be done with the story in the long run.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s not so easy to overlook is the art. The hand drawn animation overall looks solid and the action scenes look good, if a bit stiff. CGI is used very often, however, and there are certain scenes that easily could have been done normally instead of CGI. It can make some shots seem awkward or clunky. Also, every vehicle is CGI. It feels weird and out of place, and it kind of feels like a cop out (heh). For some, it could very easily become a make-or-break kind of deal when it&#039;s that obvious. <br />
<br />
Despite these flaws, Cop Craft has a lot of strengths to it that add to its charm and help to overcome its issues. For one, the vibe is awesome: it&#039;s gives off a buddy-cop movie kind of vibe with some extra darkness and grit, and it&#039;s further emphasized by how well the main leads, Kei and Tilarna play off of each other. Their relationship is cute - kind of adorable, even - and helps to lighten up some of the darker scenes. <br />
<br />
On that note, probably what gives me the most enjoyment is the writing and the dialogue between characters. The script writers did a great job of interjecting humor at the right times with great wisecracks and witty banter, and it really helps to add a little depth to the characters and helps to lighten up an otherwise gritty situation.<br />
<br />
Though the story itself may be lacking, the setting for it is pretty neat and will look familiar to those who have watched GATE or Blood Blockade Battlefront. What really gets me, however, is how &#039;human&#039; many of the other-worlders look, and I think that&#039;s a great take on it. They blend in easier with Earth society, and you aren&#039;t always able to tell at first glance who&#039;s from Earth and who isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
And the OP is straight dope, easily one of the best of the season and a definite contender for THE best. It&#039;s flashy, it&#039;s fun, it&#039;s jazzy, what more could you want? And the soundtrack also helps to further push that American buddy-cop vibe.<br />
<br />
Overall I found myself enjoying Cop Craft very much. It&#039;s a nice break from the loads of Shonen and Isekai that have been airing recently. And despite its average story it&#039;s a good take on what would happen if magic and our modern world collided. It has to be enjoyed for what it is: a fantasy-buddy-cop show starring a grizzled detective and his elvish partner busting bad guys and solving crime. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the show will play out over the course of the season.

    Don&#039;t bother if you&#039;re a fan of the Buddy Cop genre, police procedurals, good world building, or even above-mediocre animation or directing. The only positive quality Cop Craft has to offer is its unoriginal premise. But if that&#039;s what got you interested in checking it out, you&#039;ll be just as satisfied from reading the plot synopsis above as you would be from watching 12 episodes of this garbage.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s go through this one complaint at a time:<br />
<br />
The show is trying to talk about racism and xenophobia by introducing a fantasy race of immigrants from a fantasy world, which is a cheap but efficient trick. The main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318996">
        target audience of Japan doesn&#039;t have to feel alienated by having to consider the issues of groups they might not feel too inclined towards, any minority group can&#039;t feel personally offended if their issues aren&#039;t portrayed accurately, nobody can allege malice if the show references real life events incorrectly, and most importantly: anime fans by default are more interested in the fantasy aspect. However, if you&#039;re introducing a whole parallel universe of elves and fairies, you need to establish what exists in that universe and what doesn&#039;t. And over the course of 12 episodes, there hasn&#039;t been a single scene that shows us even the glimpse of a fantasy landscape. We just have to accept that magic is real now, and that it pops up as a macguffin or deus ex machina whenever it&#039;s convenient. The only other information we can infer from the plot is that the fantasy world is very traditional and antiquated and that there&#039;s no modern science or technology. That&#039;s pretty much it. There&#039;s no political dealings with the fantasy world, there&#039;s hardly any fantasy world characters besides Tilarna with more than two lines of dialogue to tell us more about their home, I personally don&#039;t even find the aliens to look all that different from Earthlings (although maybe that&#039;s due to the wonky artstyle). Neither does the show put any particular effort into portraying the influence of the fantasy immigrants on Earth&#039;s society. All that&#039;s really changed after the dimensional portal opened is that this one fictional Pacific island became a bigger metropolitan hub due to the population increase. Sure, most episodic crimes make use of some magic gimmick (a fairy bomb, vampires, a mind-switching artifact, magic memory alloy...), but those gimmicks are usually a big surprise for Tilarna as well, so they&#039;re not representative of the fantasy world&#039;s culture. Besides the main antagonist&#039;s necromancy ability, no other gimmick had any lasting effect on the plot or the setting, even though you could build an entire show around just one of them.<br />
<br />
In summary, the introduction of the fantasy aspect is ultimately just laziness as it never exceeds its function of a shorthand for racism.<br />
<br />
The biggest reason why all the potential was wasted is because they decided to make the show too episodic instead of focusing on the one big case. I&#039;m not sure how faithfully the anime adaptation follows the novel, but episodes 4-10 feel like bad fillers. Hell, even the recurring side characters do nothing but waste precious time that could&#039;ve been used for more meaningful interactions between Tilarna and Kei, or at least to build up the villain to have more of an impact.<br />
On that note, it was a stupid decision to off Elbaji as early as the 3rd episode for the surprise reveal that Zelada was behind everything all along, but then postpone the confrontation with him until the final episode. Both Zelada and Elbaji had potentially interesting (conflicting even!) motivations that could&#039;ve been explored in a better way than just dumping everything into a stereotypical villain speech right before their respective defeats. Their involvement in the mayoral election and their conspirators in the police should&#039;ve offered plenty more opportunities to fill the time, without having to add 1½ episodes about Tilarna turning into a cat and having to chase after a garbage truck. At least, if you MUST include inconsequential episodes, give us more insight into the main characters. For instance showing us for a whole episode how Tilarna struggles with everyday life on Earth, like not understanding mobile phones, cars, food, the value of money - that kinda thing (the first episode did this to a somewhat satisfying degree with Kei). Because for a Fish Out of the Water character, she&#039;s way too capable and savvy.<br />
This also ruins the buddy cop dynamic she should&#039;ve had with Kei. In order to make a Buddy Cop duo work, both character need to have clashing personalities (eg. Young Reckless vs. Old Cautious, or Goofball vs By-the-Books Sourpuss). But aside from one being a middle aged dude and the other being a foreigner loli, Kei and Tilarna are too similar. Both are proud, grumpy workaholics who just want to get the job done, insult each other with dry quips, and get into arguments when one was being too reckless when the other one wasn&#039;t prepared for it in that particular moment (they alternate between who does it). As the daughter of a noble family who got her knight&#039;s rank by birthright, and considering that she does develop something of a crush for Kei over the course of the show anyway, it wouldn&#039;t have been too farfetched to make her more innocently naive, clumsy and inexperienced - in short a stereotypical loli character - rather than easily irritated and overall bitchy. Her cute character design certainly would&#039;ve suggested that the show was gonna go for the Newbie vs. Jaded clash. In terms of character development, Tilarna could&#039;ve grown more mature from overcoming shocking experiences like murder, prostitution, drugs, etc. while Kei could&#039;ve softened a bit and rediscovered his compassion - as you&#039;d expect from someone who in the 1st episode couldn&#039;t even be assed to tell his deceased partner&#039;s wife about her husband&#039;s death in person.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll admit that there were a few jokes here and there that summoned 5% of a chuckle out of me, but I laughed WAY more at some of the now infamous animation goofs that would look more fitting in the studio&#039;s previous show Teekyu, a no-budget 3-minute nonsense comedy. The visuals really didn&#039;t do Range Murata&#039;s original artwork justice. If the writing and directing was solid enough, this would&#039;ve been excusable. But when neither the story nor the visuals are convincing, I can only strongly recommend against committing yourself to the whole series.<br />
<br />
Spend your time with better shows!

    &quot;It&#039;s the American dream, you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
If a gate opened to a magical fantasy land, which would be the likely outcome?<br />
<br />
A) You are summoned as a hero and must defeat Generic Evil Overlord #21,576 with the help of your newly found godlike powers and a harem of people desperate for your love and affection.<br />
<br />
B) The people from both sides engage in awkward coexistence and cultural exchange, featuring racism, guns, pornography, drugs, theft, prostitution, humanoid trafficking, terrorism, rampant consumerism, and cats.<br />
<br />
By the very nature of their premises, cultural commentary and social issues should be natural topics for isekai series. After all, isekai is supposed to be about

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318755">
        travelling to other worlds, and the obvious thing to do would be gawking at the different cultures like a confused tourist. However, very often these issues are neglected almost entirely, with series instead choosing to focus on arbitrary godlike superpowers and harems the size of a phone book. This begs the question: why bother with the whole &quot;transported to another world&quot; setup in the first place if all you are doing is the same old story of harem antics and generic villains? Even though it has its faults as well and is far from perfect, Cop Craft at least manages to avoid that fate.<br />
<br />
In this case, I suppose &quot;reverse isekai&quot; is more accurate because the story takes place on good old Earth. Kei and Tilarna, who are from different worlds, team up to form a cop duo who fight crime in a city populated by both Semanians and humans (or the Doreany, as called by the Semanians). The city is on an island in the Pacific that was originally Semanian soil and was transported to Earth by a gate that happened to open between the planets.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing reverse isekai more often because it is refreshing to have Earth as the setting once in a while. This show seems to agree because it goes ham on Earth culture. The dialogue showcases cultural references from Earth and can often be witty. It is worth noting that both species consist of individuals with clearly different personalities and interests. The Semanians are definitely not a Planet of the Hats, a species with a single defining feature shared by almost all members. They are simply individual people, just like humans. Many of the Semanians have adapted to life on Earth remarkably well. If it wasn&#039;t for their slightly different appearance, I would often have a hard time telling them apart from humans. Tilarna, who is a noble and only recently arrived, initially seems out of touch with not only humans but many other Semanians as well.<br />
<br />
Another pop quiz. If visitors from another planet arrived on Earth, what would they be after:<br />
<br />
A) natural resources,<br />
B) humans as manual slave labor, or<br />
C) porn magazines.<br />
<br />
If your answer was C), congrats. Apparently, even the boring, low-quality ones are worth a fortune in a fantasy world that has almost no photos. Incidentally, the shops on Earth are allegedly too well stocked in general, making it difficult to choose items.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know the name of Earth&#039;s God? &#039;Money.&#039; Simplest thing in the world, right? I&#039;ve converted to its religion, too.&quot;<br />
A Semanian big-time criminal says so.<br />
<br />
Given that the protagonists are in the police, particular attention is given to due process. There are rights and obligations that protect citizens from arbitrary police action but also make it more difficult to convict criminals, even when it is obvious that they are guilty. Tilarna, the alleged knight of justice, criticizes this pretty frequently. &quot;Is this the justice of your world?&quot; and so on. Search warrants? What are those? Beating up suspects? Just another day at the office.<br />
<br />
Racial tensions are fairly often portrayed in isekai series, but this time they are more eerily similar to our current political discourse. A hard-right politician, Tourte, has a central message of &quot;live by human rules or go home&quot; and he wants to deport Semanian criminals (after revoking their citizenship, I suppose) in large numbers because many of them are involved in crime. One of his ads is saying &quot;San Teresa first,&quot; and his supporters are holding signs of &quot;ET, go home.&quot; Another character argues that the Semanians are &quot;invading&quot; Earth without even knowing it themselves simply by staying here. Meanwhile, calling the Semanians &quot;aliens&quot; is considered racist in some circles. We also get the &quot;all the options on the ballot are terrible&quot; view on democracy because the other candidates have other problems. <br />
<br />
However, some of the attempts at ethical and political arguments are left unfinished. For instance, at one point Tilarna is arguing with Tourte and saying that the island was originally Semanian soil, while Tourte argues that it is now on Earth, so it belongs to humans. A more effective argument against Tourte would be that it is up to chance who is born where and thus which people are deported. It would force Tourte to argue harder, but Tilarna does not present it. There is also a lot of untapped potential when it comes to the social issues here, and I feel like the screentime could have been used a bit more effectively to highlight them in a more varied way. The ending also tries to downplay how volatile the political situation is, which seems like an unjustified 180-degree turn from some of the previous episodes.<br />
<br />
The show also has other problems. One thing I&#039;d prefer is a more cohesive plot. Some of the cases are not directly linked to the main plot. There is still some thematic cohesion and connected details, but tying the different cases together more strongly would definitely be a good idea. I can barely remember some of the one-episode antagonists. The worst offender by far is a sequence of 1.5 episodes (episode 8 and a part of 9) that focuses on generic slapstick comedy and some particularly off-putting fanservice scenes related to a particular scifi plot device and a cat. It is based on a freak accident and is dragged on for far too long. It contributes basically nothing to the main plot or the themes either. This part felt so out of place that I feel like I have to specifically mention it. Fanservice is far from rare in anime, but this was far more awkward than usually.<br />
<br />
Kei and Tilarna often have good banter going on about Earth culture and related topics. Their chemistry is pretty solid and also varied enough, though Tilarna&#039;s excessive Tsundere side can be hit-or-miss in some scenes. Some of the side characters such as the other cops and the informant guy also get some witty lines, but many of them are still starved for screentime. Meanwhile, the main villain gets barely any screentime or development and is left at a somewhat generic level. If you forgot that he existed and got an &quot;oh right, that guy&quot; moment near the end, I won&#039;t blame you. The side villains somehow get even less, and I can&#039;t even remember their names.<br />
<br />
Additional world-building wouldn&#039;t hurt, for Earth but especially for the Semanian planet. Could we at least step on Semanian soil (not including the island) a few times and see first-hand how they live? It is not as though isekai must take place in only one world. We learn some aspects of Semanian society by second-hand testimony, but that is no substitute for witnessing the place for ourselves. Apparently, there was initially a war between the two sides before they could reach an agreement on the land, but the war is only mentioned in passing.<br />
<br />
<br />
The opening song is called &quot;Paradise City&quot; with pretty catchy music. The video features a superficially cheerful city full of neon lights, but it quickly becomes obvious that it is full of gunfights, people armed with guns in general, and also car chases, explosions, etc. A true paradise, alright. This is the kind of naming I would use too: sarcasm. <br />
<br />
The ending song, &quot;Connected,&quot; has Tilarna singing while the video highlights the mixed, blurred culture that has been born out of the coexistence of the two species. In this instance, some of the artwork is pretty great, such as some backgrounds of the city and the rain effects.<br />
<br />
The stylistic choices are a mixed bag. I like some of them. San Teresa looks like a fairly typical large city on Earth: not very posh but not a total slum either, sometimes with additional neon lights. It showcases both the prettier and uglier parts of life on Earth. Notably, the cars look old-school and a bit of thought must have gone into their designs. On the other hand, there is occasionally awkward-looking fanservice that does not quite fit in the situation. Usually it is within tolerable bounds, but the filler episode I mentioned is a serious offender, and I am not saying so lightly.<br />
<br />
What stands out is that the quality of animation for the series overall is clearly lacking. Aside from lazy-looking motion sometimes, it sometimes get so bad that the characters are speaking with a still frame on-screen. No mouths moving or anything. Some action scenes also end up looking like a series of still slides, kind of a PowerPoint presentation. I can only guess that the studio must have been running on a shoestring budget, forced to cut corners whenever even remotely possible. <br />
<br />
<br />
The setting has great potential. They should simply focus even more on its strengths. Do more world-building, visit the other planet as well, showcase the different cultural aspects more. Don&#039;t try to brush aside a tense political situation that you hyped up just before. Have the main villain actually appear onscreen now and then. Avoid PowerPoint slideshows. And drop the worst of the filler and the most off-putting fanservice, of course. I really wanted to like this show more because the setting is great and the dialogue is witty sometimes, but then I remember some of the questionable parts, and my heart sinks.<br />
<br />
I wish they were allowed to build a McDonald&#039;s on the Semanian planet. I think it would do well.

    This show is so engaging it didn&#039;t even occur to me to critique the artwork until after I had read other reviews on it.<br />
<br />
I was so engrossed by the story and especially the banter and interaction between the two MCs that I didn&#039;t notice any problems with the artwork at all.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s only upon going back and rewatching some episodes that I see where, yes, they cut some corners in some scenes.<br />
<br />
This might be my favorite show of the season, and it&#039;s going up against stiff competition from some other excellent shows. I do like that it&#039;s cute without being too cute, funny without being too

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316729">
        comedic. The pacing is pretty fast without leaving the viewer behind in the dust, exactly how I like it.

This show was a serious letdown for me. I thought that I&#039;d found a diamond in the rough, but really, I found a boring, surface-level, waifu-baiting, white-bread anime. <br />
<br />
COP CRAFT is another anime that seriously harms its credibility with out-of-place fanservice. I don&#039;t know why, but it seems like literally everyone in Japan is in a constant state of pure-horniness. Like, it&#039;s obnoxious. In the last episode, for example, the stark contrast between the tones of the A-story and the B-story completely takes the viewers out of the story. It&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318873">
        sad, because the story WAS actually there, it was just poorly executed. There are like, 3 episodes dedicated to meaningful plot development, the rest are just pure nothingness. <br />
<br />
Another thing that this show had going for it was the realness of the world. From just the OP, which is actually pretty good, the viewer is immersed in a neo-classic buddy-cop adventure. If the show had played to its strongsuits, it would have actually been good. It didn&#039;t, though. Instead, it tried to key in on on how cute its female protagonist was. Yeah, i&#039;ll admit, when I first clicked on the COP CRAFT MAL page, it was because the waifu caught my eye, but that&#039;s not why I chose to watch. And given this show&#039;s ratings, I would imagine that i&#039;m not the only one who feels this way.<br />
<br />
The last strength of this anime is the male protagonist, Matoba. Matoba is relatable despite being in a completely unrelatable position. He&#039;s an experienced, overworked detective whose cynicism has been cultivated over a long career. Honestly, this is probably a trope in cop-related fiction, but I wouldn&#039;t know, since i&#039;m fairly new to the genre.<br />
<br />
Overall, COP CRAFT is another letdown. 5/10.

    To get the premise out of the way first, Cop Craft is basically a buddy cop show that mixes Rush Hour (two cops of different cultures working together) with the concept from Blood Blockade Battlefront (Kekkai Sensen; dimensional gate creates a mixed [distinctly American] city of alien + human technology and cultures).<br />
<br />
Compared to Blood Blockade Battlefront the setting is a lot more toned down. The connected alien world is more in the line of classic medieval fantasy and less absurd. Magic exists, but it is, even for the alien culture, a rare trait and not flashy or simplistic. The show is more about the mix

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318847">
        of the magically influenced technology mixing with the human made technology.<br />
<br />
In this type of premise a lot rides on the world and characters and I&#039;m happy to say that it fulfills both fields to a great degree. The characters chemistry and bickering is a joy to watch and the alien concepts seem to be well implemented (from what we see in the show, which is, as always with shows that have tons of source material, just a snippet).<br />
The show also allows the alien part of the duo to grow, which is quite important for the younger part that has no experience with humanity and grew up in nobility.<br />
Cop Craft also touches on some real issues (xenophobia, political intrigue, prostitution, corruption, violence etc.) through the lens of its world and it handles these subjects very well.<br />
<br />
So far this all sound quite decent, so why is it that the show gets such a low score (from me and others) and the answer is very unfortunate: the production.<br />
While the general writing is very good, the animation and sound are a minefield.<br />
(Quick disclaimer, this review is based on the simulcast, not the BD, which could possibly improve some of the worst parts.)<br />
We can&#039;t look into the productions of the anime, but here something went obviously array.<br />
Parts of the show look decent or even great, like the opening and some fight sequences, other parts are glorified chaotic slideshows with mismatching audio.<br />
<br />
Example (skip this paragraph if you are not interested in my example; no spoiler):<br />
In an episode a character slides on his weapon down a metal fire staircase to follow a suspect, while this is animated quite well (sparks flying and the characters throwing his body around the corners), there is no audio accompanying this scene.<br />
In other scenes we get sword fights that are cut together of still pictures without any movement and without any sense of space and repeating hollow metal sounds to go with it (not the sound two swords make).<br />
<br />
My best guess is that some parts were given to good animators that did their job really well, but for other parts they either ran out of money or time (or both) and had to / decided to cut everything they had at the time together, to at least resemble a coherent story.<br />
Episode 3 is the finale of the first arc and is the most egregious example of this practice in action. It cuts together content worth 3 episodes with minimal to no animation in a slideshow with no sense of time or space. This was not just bad for the audiovisual enjoyment, but also killed the pace of this finale, that was meant to be a spectacle with twists and turns. How this happened is any ones guess.<br />
<br />
So in the end we have quite a dilemma on our hands. Most people, me included like the show, but you can&#039;t really overlook the 30/30/30 ratio of the show (30% good animation, 30% okay animation and 30% no animation), which makes it very hard to rate.<br />
I will give this show two scores and mash them together for a final score, because we need some kind of score for this review.<br />
Taking only the worst parts of the show, I award the show with a 2, because the character design and world is still pretty to look at and while the story in these parts is very hard to follow, it still has a semblance of something better.<br />
Taking only the best parts, I award the show an 8 (this might be a 9 if you liked what you read from my little summary and if you desire some buddy cop style stuff), because it still has some tropes that get old very fast (the running gag about cars getting destroyed or the bulletproof couch as an example for this) even though the writing is very good.<br />
<br />
Who is this anime for?<br />
I think this show can be watched by everyone interested in a fun ride with some decent buddy cop conversations mixed with some dark and close to reality material.<br />
Just don&#039;t forget that you also need some thick skin to watch through the truly horrifying production failures.

    Cop Craft is a very disappointing show.<br />
<br />
It should have been good, even great. It has a cool premise, nice character designs, great chemistry between the leads. The opening scene of the first episode is great, and the beginning of the show was generally a fun time, even if wasn&#039;t that great to look at.<br />
<br />
However, the show went from &#039;not that great to look at&#039; to downright laughable, especially in the last few episodes (the one after the recap was dreadful), and the visuals are easily the worst thing about the show.<br />
<br />
The story also feels like it got downgraded as the season went along. There were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318762">
        plot threads and ideas that didn&#039;t go anywhere, there was the completely inconsequential two episode mini-arc that felt like cheap fanservice filler, and the finale is really anticlimactic (not to mention a full recap episode).<br />
<br />
Overall I would say the first couple episodes are worth a watch, but don&#039;t bother with the rest of it unless you really like the characters or are really into the buddy cop thing.

    Guess ppl come to this anime expecting cheap comedy and combats that last for 100episodes or something... its the my only guess to why this anime has scored so low. [Spoilless Review]<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t deserve it, this anime is quite good on its own, first of all its a Seinen anime, not a Shounen of course Battles aren&#039;t going to last long or be polished enough because it doesn&#039;t matter to the plot, they aren&#039;t the main focus of the anime anyway. Non-child friendly topics going to be discussed often(but they aren&#039;t filosofal or anything, just mature stuff), some might be tough for children to comprehend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336424">
        even though the female character looks like it came out of a Shounen manga or something.  She does goes through a huge development in personality, and  intelectual growth and for that alone is worth the watch.<br />
I&#039;m confident this is an anime you will enjoy, as you grow older, cause some of the situations that are represented in the anime do happen in our world constantly, although we don&#039;t have faires and magicians around irl of course.<br />
<br />
Clearly the fights are simple, straight to the point, no need to rumble on the same battle over decades before you get to progress the story. Also they aren&#039;t 100% perfectly animated but it kinda works out. The story is alwasy rolling so there are nearly no fillers in the anime.<br />
<br />
The interactions between 2 polar oposite characters is gold in this series, for me. What&#039;s more hilarious then having a Cop who has bad mouth and be poorly behaved partnering-up with a high royalty Alien knight girl that also as short temper and knows little to nothing about the world she is coming to work on?<br />
<br />
[Final Verdict]<br />
Is this anime wroth your time? Yes it is! As mature content? Yap, some not a fan-service type of anime of course, but since you are dealing with cops has main protagonists, you can expect some prostitution/blood/murders/etc. Can I watch this anime with a more mature audience? Yes you can!<br />
<br />
I gave it a 10/10, but I know this anime could easy score 8-9 if more matured ppl watched it.

    I must say that I resent quite how underrated this anime was in the season, but well a lot usually happens in this medium.<br />
<br />
Regarding Cop Craft I found it enjoyable from start to finish, it had an excellent police history with a very well set and varied city that reminded me a lot of Hellsalem&#039;s Lot of Kekkai Sensen, the protagonists have a unique connection and it is very easy to sympathize with them and its cause<br />
<br />
Although the animation was not perfect, it is very unfair that they discredit the anime for having a fall in the quality of animation in some chapters, however the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318791">
        series was able to recover and give us a good adaptation. <br />
<br />
Finally the OP &amp;amp; ED and OST are just great.

I&#039;m tired of shonen since i&#039;m an adult so i&#039;m always glad when i see a seinen genre.<br />
<br />
I could have put a better score if there was no lolita ... Japaneses have serious problems in their head to find sexy kawai a child ... For now I leave this note because I really enjoy the adult and realistic universe of the series, but if the story turns more around the lolita side, this anime and especially the main character will have lost all its interest.<br />
<br />
In summary, if you have thought

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314743">
        from the first episode &quot;ok cool why not, but why a fucking child again !!!!! ...&quot; you should probably enjoy the series until episode 5. (Although some passages were already limit for me and the child begins to really annoy me with all these typical lolita reactions.). I can&#039;t say anything for the rest of the series without having seen it but I expect the worst and not in a good way .. But i still have hope so for now i would say that this anime have potential let&#039;s see...

    Tonight, I wanna talk about this weird ass show called Cop Craft that came out this past summer.Its kind of a blend of fantasy and crime drama which is something I don&#039;t mind.Hell, I was actually in favor of how fantasy is incorporated rather than just being something random in a weak excuse to make a magical world.But I&#039;m not talking about Alderman rn, I&#039;m talking about Cop Craft, a show where elves and humans live together but there are some tensions going on between races. So a cop named Kei Mataba has to team up with an elf girl called Exidilika or something and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325464">
        they craft some cops I guess.<br />
<br />
Now to describe the actual story in forms of quality, it&#039;s like a waterfall.The actual start of the show was very promising but about two detective cases in, the show falls and plummets into the ground around the latter middle half.The actual cases were very interesting but for a crime show it&#039;s very childish. The strongest cases in the show being in the beginning and then next thing ya know, you got Exidilika switching bodies with a cat and having to dumpster dive to find a fancy artifact.I know it&#039;s not a show&#039;s priority to be serious all the time, but in Cop Crafts case, you can tell just how much the creators thought about the story, which is barely at all, from the cliche as hell plot twists, laughibly incorporated themes of racisim and much more.Just because its dumb doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not  fun, but when the show tries to be serious you can&#039;t really tell because of how dumb everything else is.<br />
<br />
I will give some props to how the world is developed with hybrids of fantasy and modern America, it&#039;s not like stories that have elves and fairies and stuff in it because it looks supah kewl.The magic is incorporated in real world criminal items ,such as certain narcotics, and that element was actually something I rarely see in anime.<br />
<br />
The animation is…. Off. It&#039;s not very good or very terrible, or even alright all the time.Its just weird as hell. It was done by Millepensee, who worked on a crapton of Teekyu and also did the really really really really really bad Berserk 2016 anime(*gags*). It does that thing I really hate where it spends almost all of its budget in the first episode and screws itself royally for the rest.Mainly for the first episode and sometimes throughout the rest, it looks very freaking good, albeit, a bit rough around the edges,but when the animation gets bad,                           <br />
<br />
<br />
  It          <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gets            <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Horrid.<br />
<br />
Your scale of quality can range from the awesome fight scene in episode one to really weird looking power-point sliding man that you see in the shows’ beginning narration.It looks like some shit from Adult Swim. There is a very raw quality about the animation that I kinda like, and what I also like is just how terrible it can get.Oh and this clusterfucc in quality doesn’t just apply to the animation.It kinda has that Black Clover disease in which the character designs I actually really like but they are kinda ruin due to them being animated very weirdly and disproportionate at many times.Some fight scenes are actually so weirdly animated that you don’t know what’s happening.Other times, there are just still frames that pop up and look like my computer crashed.Also, there are a plethora of animation and coloring mistakes and It’s just a sight to see.    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is alright, the op’s good too, and the ED is also fine.tbh I don’t really think the music matters that much.Some of the foley was kinda weird and other times, the atmosphere was established well probably because the soundtrack is very short so there are scenes where there are just no music.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kei Matoba is just your standard detective guy who lives a lonely detective life, he has a small amount of personality that is better than none.One thing that he does develop about his character is his discrimination against elves or fairies or whatever they are. Interestingly, he happens to be super passionate about cars and happens to have some great chemistry with Tilarna.Tilarna herself is a handful at first, but she happens to be a culmination of many tropes:tsundere fancy girl,quiet yet assassin, and the silly new girl,To be honest, she owns all of those tropes and doesn’t happen to be obnoxious in any singular one.She also has as much personality as Kei, not much, but she does become badass at times and that does even out her character.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the other characters are just background noise, none are that well written.Most of the characters that work with Mataba at his agency DO have some personalities and they are a very diverse group of people with different races and sexual orientations, but surprise surprise, they barely matter to the plot.I really liked them, but it seemed like they were in their own anime and did not matter. One thing i do like is that how the show conveys the absurdity of politics with political leaders who are just super unlikable people with rule books, kinda like it has its own commentary that is so hamfisted that I might as well grab some pineapple slices..But yeah, in the end, these characters are just there to just be people and nothing else, I mean even one character does show emotion and literally dies, and the Mataba is pretty much like “sorry, but ur not a main character lol”<br />
<br />
I know I should conclude, but I don’t know what to really say about this show, It’s one of those shows that just happens to be so messy that I ironically enjoy it, like Black Clover, but if you like good shows, well………<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall-6 <br />
If Cop Craft does get a season two, I will fly to Japan and help animate it MYSELF<br />

    I have never given a review out of all anime&#039;s I have watched in my life, but Cop craft resonated powerfully with me as a African American and that is due to the character of Tilarna Exedilica. The animation at times is choppy and the episode endings cliche, but that didn&#039;t stop me from getting a lot of enjoyment out of the series and I wish for a second season. Kei Matoba resonates powerfully with my in regards to my friends, being African American I have had many friend&#039;s families tell their kids they shouldn&#039;t associate with me because of my skin color, my race,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318907">
        but kei represents what a lot of my friends did for me growing up, they went against their own raising, families and their community to remain friends with me. Some have even put their lives on the line for me.

    Ok, so that&#039;s it folks, for this anime, that is, but you know when it come to certain anime that has that police genre, this basically was a good one, cu&#039;z unlike other animes with such genre most of it doesn&#039;t have such realism as this one, that was because, when it says &quot;Police&quot; it doesn&#039;t always mean that way, cu&#039;s usually everything were pretty much exaggerated that it can no long be called as a &quot;Police&quot; genre. so how do I rate this anime??????? Here&#039;s how:<br />
<br />
Story-Good 7: The story plot may have some from fantasy and magic, but the genre that was mostly used

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318853">
        here was the Police part. Now, good as it was, the problem of this anime was that the timing of the executions of the plot per episode were a bit off as if anime director  Itagaki, Shin want&#039;s this to be more like a mini-series than and episode based anime. <br />
<br />
Art-Decent 4: If one would be looking for something risque around here, well one can only expect a few, mainly Tilarna&#039;s battle outfit, disco tech scene and some of her shower scene, but don&#039;t expect it to long enough to be enjoyed, cu&#039;z such fan-service around here were mostly flashes.<br />
<br />
Sound- very good 8: Cu&#039;z here them seiyuu&#039;s don&#039;t have to mask their voice to act like teenagers given that them characters here were grown ups, in fact only Tilarna has to have that teenage voice given that her seiyuu is only  23. <br />
<br />
Character- Fair 6: Frankly, I kinda hate the idea that the tandem Kei and Tilarna look more like a father and Daughter thing or should I say that this anime has that part where it suggest a Lolicon relationship between Kei and Tilarna, even though Tilarna is a 26 year old in a 14 year old body given that she&#039;s a  Semaanian. As for Kei, well, at one point I kinda like that he was this cop with a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; attitude, but having him to baby site a Semaanian Knight that has a 14 year old body was kinda waste of his role as a bad ass cop. Then again for them to be this crime fighting duo was not bad in fact we can say that original creator  Gatoh, Shoji may have gotten the idea from the 1989 movie &quot;Red Heat&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-Very good 8: Definitely a very good 12 episode &quot;Police&quot; genre anime.<br />
<br />
Overall-Very Good 8: This deserve a season 2. <br />
<br />

    Months of waiting for what I would soon see become the king of mediocrity, Cop Craft aired and showed us how detrimental a poor budget can be. That being said, it is not terrible per se and should hover around a 7/10. If you&#039;re a sucker for cop/buddy stories, go ahead and watch but dont expect anything ground breaking. <br />
<br />
You are brought into San Teresa City and have an amazing first few episodes then we fall into mediocrity. Dependent on your perception of the characters, it will define the viewing expereince for you. The ending is honestly pretty cool. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pros: -Characterization for the main characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318765">
        and a select few are very well. Relationships are built well in dialogue. Without the characters, the show has nothing. Executed very well. <br />
-  Story flows well at times<br />
- Distinctive soundtrack<br />
<br />
Cons: Severely inconsistent animation but there are some decent scenes. If you were to watch throughout the series, there is no telling which episode would be animated sufficiently. <br />
- 12 episodes is way too short for the underdeveloped antagonist/story.<br />
- Some episodes were wasted. <br />
<br />
The storytelling is a bit odd; a short stall in the story/progression midway is sufficient enough to make you believe that this is just a story of two cops, rather than definitively taking down an antagonist by its conclusion. Consequently, this makes the ending of the series appear to be rushed, etc. <br />
<br />
Cop Craft is a solid watch for a buddy/cop story and never loses hold of that dynamic. The plot/characters are decently aired out just enough to make it watchable on an episodic basis. There are comedic moments. Cop Craft is a good show for any lull in a season but do not come in with high expectations. <br />
<br />
