There he meets Rui, a girl whose lack of excitement rivals that of himself...." />

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AND FILTHY LANGUAGE FOR A FILTHY ANIME***<br />
<br />
Welcome aboard Domestic Dumpsterfire, the train to hell… Along the way, we’ll see plenty of incest, degeneracy, forced drama, braindead characters, and the main reason why this show so popular, sex scenes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you, now is the time to grab a shovel and join me in burying abomination for good.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, there was a dumb sack of potatoes named Natsuo. Fittingly, his name sounds like nut-sack because that is his defining character trait. His sex addiction rivals the protagonist of School Days and it gets

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304738">
        him into so much trouble with his harem of needy waifus. His harem includes:<br />
<br />
1. Rui, a girl who he had sex with randomly to forget his crush, but now she’s his step-sister.<br />
2. Hina, his teacher who he has a crush on, and now she is also his stepsister.<br />
3. Momo, a depressed girl with big boobs who the writers forget about right after she’s introduced.<br />
4. An annoying green-haired girl who is so forgettable I can’t even remember her name.<br />
<br />
Wow!!! What a positively electric cast full of chemistry! As for the story… The main conflict only involves Natsuo, Rui, and Hina, making a pseudo-incestuous love triangle. The only entertaining parts of the show are when giant melodrama bombs are dropped on us, shaking up the stale romantic tension. The first arc features Hina in an affair with a married man, then Natsuo butts his head into her business by sexually assaulting her. Don’t worry, she sexually assaults him shortly after. What an emotional roller coaster! No matter how much the writers try to raise the states, the plot is too hamfisted for it to be believable. Instead, they have to use plot contrivances and inconsistent character motivations to build artificial tension. With a premise this stupid, the only way for it to work is if the characters are even more stupid. <br />
<br />
For the majority of the show, we’re treated to insultingly dull slice-of-life crap. The ‘comedy’ is just a gap between one melodramatic hentai subplot to the next. Girls compete for Natsuo’s attention, and he is as indecisive as a blank-slate dating-sim protagonist so he gives them all time. Very little time is spent trying to resolve his love for his teacher, and their scenes together are the most toxic, and unhealthy in the entire show. His one believable moment of introspection is at the start of the show when he resolves to forget his love and have sex with a Rui. Even though it is a bad decision, he accepts it in the heat of the moment. The mistake was a realistic one, but I expected the show to develop Natsuo from this as he learned better ways to overcome unrequited love. Instead, he just continues to make the same mistakes. No one in this show ever learns anything. They’re all infuriatingly brainless, I swear to god the entire cast has three brain cells in total and they’re all struggling to understand what common sense is. Whenever a love affair becomes too idiotic or repetitive, the show shifts to a new one. At times it is wrought with over-the-top melodrama to the point that it becomes self-parody. <br />
<br />
Domestic Girlfriend redefines bland characters; we are left with plenty of dead air in between the salacious incest drama. So how do we solve this issue? Filler! So much pointless fluff. Entire episodes are occasionally dedicated to a one-off conflict that has zero effect on the show afterward. The rest of the awkward silence is filled with unfunny comedy. The parts of the story that are interesting are at best so-bad-it&#039;s-good levels of stupidity. There is no part of Domestic Girlfriend that is remotely thought-provoking, it’s substanceless melodrama for the sake of shock value and taboo sex appeal. That doesn’t mean this show isn’t without intriguing questions such as...<br />
<br />
“Is it incest if you shove a suppository up your step-sister&#039;s ass?” and<br />
“Is it wrong to fuck your underage student who is also legally your brother?”<br />
<br />
Rui and Hina are very thinly characterized, but Hina gets more focus. It’s a shame considering she is the worst of the two. Rui is very stupid mind you, she doesn’t realize her stepbrother disappears every night to fuck her sister. No Rui, he is not going to hang out with his friend. At the very least, I understand why she decides to throw away her virginity in the first episode. She wanted to be an adult. Hina talked down to her for never being ‘held by someone,’ just like a child. Sadly that’s all the depth Rui has. When she gets desperate for Natsuo’s attention, she kisses him in a way that suggests love. Then directly after she acts like a kid annoyed with him for picking her older—bustier—sister. On the other hand, Hina is more of a controversial character. Her love affair at the start of the show is a basic telenovela drama, then it ends abruptly so she can pursue her brother. She continuously acknowledges how morally wrong it is to mess around with her student/brother/underage teen, but continues to do so anyway. Destined to become another red dot on the sex offender registry. Hina gets punished for her poor decisions plenty of times, but it’s impossible to pity someone who dug their own grave; at some point, she’d have to lie in it. Potato man AKA Natuso is the worst of the three. He has sex because at the start of the show Rui throws herself at him before they even know each other, but then he regrets it because he has a crush on his teacher. Great, another generic blank slate self-insert.<br />
<br />
None of the side characters have any development at all. Anytime they are on screen they’re wasting time. Their main purpose is to dispense comedy with some weightless melodrama tossed here and there. The story is so haphazardly put together that it’s hard to tell what it is actually trying to be about. Momo, the prominent side hoe, is braindead. Her whole introduction to Rui was so contrived. She puts on a blatantly fake nice girl, with a secret dark side. She tried to kill herself, revealed in a soft-core porn scene, and handled as delicately as a screwdriver. Other than that, she wanted to fuck the potato protagonist. Shortly after she’s introduced, the writers pretty much forgot about her. The same issue affects Miu, the green-haired one (I looked up her name). While she never gets romantically involved with Natsuo, she serves as more waifu-bait fodder. Both side hoes get placed into the story by plot contrivances. They come out of nowhere just to shake up the love triangle before it starts to get boring. The love-pentagon unfortunately never happens. Miu and Momo are relegated to literature club scenes; essentially the Harem Rejects Club. It&#039;s the worst excuse for filler in the whole show. During every monotonous club scene, I prayed for pray for the awful incest shit to come back. Some say the pacing issues were due to a shitty adaptation, and that it would be better to read the manga. Personally, I wouldn’t want to touch this series again with a ten-foot pole.<br />
<br />
The main attraction of this show is pretty obvious, the sex scenes. These scenes without a doubt get the most time and attention from the animation team. With a story that was probably ripped straight from hentai, yet it&#039;s never more than teasing to keep you watching. The kissing, sex, and any other kind of provocative lewd scene come out of absolutely nowhere, seemingly to satisfy a sex-quota rather than to fit with the story. Casual conversations turn into foreplay at the drop of a hat, there&#039;s always a contrived wrench thrown in to lead to sex. In one instance, Natsuo peeps on his sister masturbating because cuckolding is so SEXY. All of the characters are horny, and it&#039;s treated as a deep personality trait and taken so seriously. Even when Natsuo commits his love to Hina, he kisses Rui just because she asked him to in the next scene… And this all happens with the door left open so that Hina can watch! Why does no one in this shitfest know how to close a door?!<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a unique atmosphere to this anime that really fits all of this thrilling drama. In other words, there is none. <br />
<br />
Sometimes the best background music in a scene is none at all, but that saying shouldn’t apply to half of the show. There are some simplistic piano pieces and ambient effects here and there, but the rest is so boring. The actual soundtrack is repetitive elevator music with such a slow tempo. There is one single saving grace in the whole show, the opening theme. Even in a show as phoned in as this one, the performer Minami delivers one of the best openings of this season. Diomedea is not exactly known for they’re visual prowess, but this is one series where they seemed to have more budget than usual, well in the first couple of episodes. Character designs struggle to stay on model, looping animation is used constantly to cut corners. The scene transitions are reminiscent of a PowerPoint presentation with their amateur dissolve fades. Each episode ends with a bizarre shot of an underwear model, sometimes it comes directly after the final scene finishes. Natsuo and Hina tenderly embracing one another in the final moments, then suddenly SMASH CUT TO NAKED WOMAN! It’s perfect.<br />
<br />
The background art is barren of visual information and feels like rather than as a stylistic choice this was done out of a lack of care. You can tell a story through showing rather than telling, but Domestic Girlfriend is content with just telling. For example, revealing information about a character through how their home is decorated is a great way of developing their personality without needing heavy-handed dialogue. Visually, it is at best barren of anything interesting to look at, and at worst it’s a hideous hilariously ugly. Across the board, this anime is a clusterfuck of bad ideas and even worse execution.<br />
<br />
Great job Diomedea, you have outdone yourself yet again. The moment I read the plot synopsis I knew this would be trash, but my expectations were blown away. Even though I lowered the bar as far down as I could, this anime still exceeded all levels of hot steaming garbage I could expect from a romance. This is a spectacular dumpster fire that must be experienced firsthand, but after you do, don&#039;t forget to bury it when you&#039;re done, and never dig it up again.

    SPOILERS INCLUDED.<br />
(I didn&#039;t read the manga so I can&#039;t compare manga and anime side-by-side).<br />
<br />
Will you do it with me, here? - random passing girl, age 16.<br />
<br />
After this awful experience, I have to confirm my theory: don&#039;t follow friends&#039; recommendations. I didn&#039;t want to watch Domestic na Kanojo, but some guys were saying Wow! It was E-P-I-C, watch it! - and I had time to waste - so in the end I decided to watch it and... what can I say? It was horrible.<br />
<br />
- Plot<br />
<br />
The premise is quite dumb, because Domestic Girlfriend talks about a random girl called Rui who asks a TOTALLY RANDOM boy she

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304744">
        meets, called Natsuo, to have sex... well... okay? He accepts. And Natsuo is in love with his teacher, Hina. Okay. Then, we get to know that Natsuo&#039;s father is remarrying. Natsuo&#039;s new stepmother is Hina and Rui&#039;s mother. Wow! What a coincidence! You may think: &quot;This is just the original premise. It&#039;ll probably get better later, don&#039;t worry!&quot;. But you&#039;re wrong. Domestic na Kanojo&#039;s plot is ENTIRELY BUILT on coincidences. Let&#039;s talk about coincidences in anime.<br />
There are cute coincidences, like &quot;boy accidentally meets girl&quot; and they don&#039;t take themselves too seriously. There can be Deus Ex Machina in an event. But this anime is a constant succession of coincidences and Deus Ex Machina! There were points in which Domestic Girlfriends could end! No. The plot forcedly goes forward, episode after episode.<br />
<br />
Examples during the series<br />
- Natsuo&#039;s new stepsisters are Hina and Rui.<br />
- Hina sees Natsuo and Rui while kissing.<br />
- Rui sees Natsuo and Hina while doing things.<br />
- Natsuo sees Hina while mast-<br />
<br />
Got it? This series should be taken itself seriously. But it&#039;s not, because it&#039;s not believable. It has more fantasy scenes than an isekai anime. And that&#039;s bad. But HEY! BD/DVDs will have explicit scenes! More actual PLOT!<br />
<br />
- Art/Sound<br />
<br />
The art is actually alright. Not the best ever, but it&#039;s okay, not bad like some shows this season (mmmmh... Date a Live III is that you?) - so we can say art is one of the best aspects this show has got. The OP is really good. The greatest this season for sure. Too bad it&#039;s wasted on a series like Domestic na Kanojo... The ED is quite good too.<br />
I don&#039;t get why a sad music was played when Hina was mast----<br />
<br />
- Characters<br />
<br />
I HATE THEM! I HATE THEM ALL! Except Rui, maybe<br />
Thinking: &quot;A character who does bad things is not automatically a bad character&quot; is right. But Domestic Girlfriend&#039;s characters are awful.<br />
<br />
Natsuo is a dumbass. He accepts to have sex with Rui while he&#039;s in love with Hina-sensei. Then he tries to kiss Hina while she&#039;s sleeping the same day he gets to know that Hina and Rui will be his stepsisters. Seems right, yeah! Then he&#039;s sad for Kashiwabara Momo&#039;s story so he hangs out and does things with her, too. He says romantic sentences to Hina and then he kisses Rui. Then he constantly lies to Rui because he wants to go to Hina&#039;s house. Then he does explicit things with Hina, too! WHAT. THE HECK. IS. THIS. Are you joking? His characterisation? Mmh... let me think... I don&#039;t know, he&#039;s just an unfaithful boy. He likes to write books and tales about his love for Hina-sensei... okay.<br />
Another thing pisses me off: when a girl sees him while cheating, he asks the girl who saw him betraying her: &quot;why r u saddd, why are u angryyyy&quot; - WHAT THE HECK.<br />
<br />
Then we have HINA SENSEI. The woman Natsuo fell in love with. She has a relationship with a married man. Some days after she left him, she&#039;s interested to Natsuo again. Wow! It&#039;s right! When she sees Natsuo and Rui while kissing she is immediately HEARTBROKEN and she decides to move to a new house. BUT... she wants to f- with Natsuo, still! Hey! You&#039;ve seen YOUR SISTER kissing him last day and then you betray her! What&#039;s wrong with you! You heartless monster! I hate her and Natsuo a lot.<br />
In episode 11 she says: &quot;Natsuo our relationship should end-&quot;, then, in like T-W-O seconds, she completely CHANGES idea. WHAAAAAA-<br />
<br />
We have Rui. The only girl on the right side, probably Sure, asking a stranger to have sex for knowledge isn&#039;t normal, but at least she is kinda faithful to Natsuo and she doesn&#039;t betray him/go with other guys. She didn&#039;t know Natsuo was in love with Hina-sensei, so she didn&#039;t betray her sister&#039;s confidence while kissing Natsuo by purpose. Natsuo did.<br />
<br />
We have Momo, a girl who hung out with billions of guys and she&#039;s infamous for it. Ok. Natsuo was sad so he decided to have sex with her lol. EVERYTHING IS FINE.<br />
<br />
Minor characters Natsuo, Hina and Rui&#039;s parents! Wow! They don&#039;t know their children are constantly cheating!<br />
Fumiya! Natsuo&#039;s friend he doesn&#039;t care about because Natsuo is too busy on CHEATING.<br />
Masaki Kobayashi! A dude who works of a caffé.<br />
Ashihara Miu! The president of the Literature Club! We don&#039;t know much about her, but Natsuo will probably cheat another time, I guess.<br />
Other useless characters.<br />
<br />
- Overall<br />
<br />
Domestic na Kanojo was painful to watch. It&#039;s one of the worst anime I&#039;ve watched so far. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll read the manga, but this 12 episode-based series was enough for me... I continued it just because I wanted to laugh.<br />
Damn.

    I really like this &quot;all women are whores and men even worse&quot; take on the romance genre because it&#039;s just the most realistic thing that can occur to anyone older than 15. This spiced with some dramatic edgy and lots of sex are basically the best things in life anyway.<br />
<br />
Our story starts off with the aftermaths of our main bro losing his virginity to some random girl who basically went &quot;I am so bored I want to bang you&quot; and then they did. Unfortunately this dude is also in love with (or more like lusts for) his teacher because MILFs. Just so happens to be,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300606">
        some conveniences play out and give us a basis for a romance drama where our main bro ends up living with both of these girl and... WAIT FOR IT.... Becomes sibling with them, and thereafter has to ask lots of tricky questions from himself like raw or not, old or hot, is this really all they got and why not fuck &#039;em both a lot. I.e. It&#039;s a (poetic) love triangle that aims to be realistic (outside its settings that could like never happen ever), offer more &quot;questionable&quot; take on the feelings stuff, and spit on the faces of everyone who was expecting something pure. <br />
<br />
The old teacher person is a great character. Her first 3 lines in the series are literally all stating &quot;children are off limits&quot; and then she shows green card for the dude like &quot;make your eyes less innocent and we do it&quot;. It&#039;s great, really sums up the mind of a woman in heat. The virginity-taking girl on the other hand seems to have something more going on with her character than the teacher who practically can&#039;t stop opening up about her bullshit. I.e. old is pushy while the younger girl offers certain level of mystery. I am pretty sure the dude will go with the teacher tho because he is a brick. But nevertheless, his decisions, and how strongly the characters will react to their feelings and more physical stuff is fascinating. I am finding most of it terribly interesting at this point.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t have much to say about the production. The character design is okay, the art and animation feel inconsistent at times but I don&#039;t really think it matters in a series like this. It doesn&#039;t do anything too awful and there are like no way to make something like this appear better with higher production values. The opening song was surprising tho, lots of powerful emotions going on with that singing. Pretty much the best op from this season. <br />
<br />
This is definitely a good series because it has pretty girls and it goes all the way. Basically like all those million different light novel series like Bunny Girl Senpai which are about edgy dude who helps women because he is perfect, except our dude does what all of them would&#039;ve done if the target audience wasn&#039;t aged eleven. Everyone in this series is trash so it&#039;s pretty clear there is a massive audience who will never like it and, while some of the things I stated perhaps sounded ironic, I am unironically liking this series because these type of Kuzu no Honkai/School Days/Nana storylines are much more honest than most romantic pandering anime. It&#039;s good because it feels like your typical real life shit and everyone fucks up something and is miserable. Really enjoy it when people suffer due to their own stupidity.

    One thing I never really understood about romance anime is why do most of them have to utterly fail at the one thing they set out to do. I’ve seen a plethora of romance anime which start off strong with an interesting setting and a likable cast just to throw them into a dumpster fire and follow the old, clichéd way of progressing the story. Domestic Girlfriend, unfortunately falls into the aforementioned category of romance anime.  <br />
<br />
The anime starts off pretty good with two high school students having sexual intercourse and then becoming step-siblings. Sounds like the most complicated hentai, right? Much to my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300792">
        dismay, that wasn’t the case. The first two episodes are handled pretty thoughtfully, and the characters’ actions are meticulously crafted and make sense when you realise the very awkward situation they’ve been put in. But, by episode three the fact that they became step-siblings after fornicating is pretty much forgotten. <br />
<br />
Our main trio, Natsuo, Rui and Hina do not really compliment each other well. Interactions between them do not feel candid, instead they feel like forcibly inserted melodrama. Natsuo has a crush on his teacher (Hina) since the beginning of the show but tries to suppress his feelings when they become step-siblings as an intimate relation between them would be immoral; but he puts his brain in abeyance and goes for it anyway. This wouldn’t be an issue if he only tried it once, but he tries it three times and succeeds once and that’s about the only hint of drama I could find in this anime.<br />
<br />
This show introduces interesting concepts and forgets that it did such a thing. Rui, as we learn in episode 1, has social problems and doesn’t really wants to make friends and such, but in the later episodes, (by later, I mean after 2 episodes), she has no problem whatsoever asking Natsuo’s friend to let her stay the night at his house. Ergo, it invalidates the only thing we know about her. Natsuo gets no characterisation at all other than he wants to be a novelist and that he’s a “nice guy”. The other characters are not really that well fleshed out which is to be expected as we’re only 4 episodes into the series. <br />
<br />
The music is average af, but goddamn that OP is fire. <br />
<br />
The animation is pretty good but the character designs are as generic as they get. Also, Natsuo is supposed to be in high school but he looks like he’s in his second year of college. The background art is fantastic though.<br />
Well, this anime has been pretty boring till now and, with the exception of episode 1, I was basically dragging myself through it. Episode 4 was a cringe-fest. Still, hope remains as it hasn’t been completely trash.

    Have you ever watched an anime and been annoyed at how slow the relationship between characters develops? Sometimes the furthest characters go throughout an entire season of liking each other is hand holding. Well, not with Domestic na Kanojo!!! The very first scene is two of the main characters having sex, almost making me think for a second that I had accidentally stumbled across a hentai. This anime immediately strives to set itself apart from the crowd. It endeavors to be special and throws all sorts of drama at us in the forms of forbidden incestuous love and depressed characters as if attempting to get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304745">
        us to be impressed by how far it’s willing to go to be extra dramatic and unique. Though alas, it falls far short of the mark. Honestly, I&#039;d much rather watch those imouto anime that everyone else loves to hate on over this crap. Yeah, I said it!<br />
<br />
I’d also much rather watch characters take 24+ episodes to get to the hand holding stage of their relationship over this show.<br />
<br />
There isn’t really an overarching narrative so much as a collection of short stories. I say this because the flow of the anime is simply atrocious. Characters would go through one event, such as the arc covering heroine Hina’s relationship problems, only for it to be completely forgotten for several episodes in favor of the protagonist dealing with another issue plaguing a different disturbed girl. And the worst part is that none of the characters ever evolved as people throughout these arcs nor do they learn from their mistakes. None of the scenarios were deep or impactful precisely because hardly anything ever amounted from them. They just seemed like  halfhearted attempts to create romantic tension between the characters, and for me, it just didn’t work. <br />
<br />
But don’t despair, for there is one bright spot amidst all of the mediocrity. <br />
<br />
The opening theme song, Kawaki wo Ameku, is so good that it has its own anime entry on this site. And it’s much higher rated than the anime itself. Deservedly so, because the song is amazing! The emotion that the vocalist is able to convey is really special, and is something that, from personal experience in the music industry, is hard to accomplish. So hats off to her. Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is plain, and the anime often decides to play upbeat songs during “emotional” moments that further ruin the authenticity of these scenes. Aside from Hina’s seiyuu, the other voice actors just sound so dull and uninterested. Yes, I get that that’s the point when it comes to Rui, but that doesn’t mean that the other girls have to sound so deadbeat. And Natsuo’s seiyuu isn’t any different, though I guess that perfectly fits with Natsuo’s character.<br />
<br />
Our protagonist Natsuo is one of the most generic yes men in all of anime. People complain about isekai and harem anime heroes being boring constantly, but at least they can say no from time to time, particularly when anything sexual is involved. This dude just does whatever he’s told with like one exception when he decided not to kiss one of the girls once. *clap clap* And when the anime tries to show that he regrets some of his more immoral decisions, he just goes ahead and repeats them anyway, proving that his growth as a character is still at 0%. Natsou’s incredible blandness and stagnancy is simply astounding. I honestly much prefer his glasses wearing chubby buddy. Like, by a lot.<br />
<br />
The heroines aren’t much better. By all appearances, Rui is a character that I should have enjoyed. I like both her personality and design, but she unfortunately suffers from being a poorly written character. Her awkwardness, which was her main trait, was completely thrown out the window after a few episodes, and she just doesn’t do much of anything important in the show. You could honestly write her out of the story and replace the sex scene with her with one of the other girls and nothing would change. The only female character who is actually important to the broken narrative is Rui’s sister Hina, who is the definition of a hot mess. Seriously, Hina has a lot of problems, and I’m sure she was written this way to be an interesting and layered character thanks to her flaws. But like everything else, it just doesn’t work. Why? Because she has no merits. Everything she does is immoral, and like everyone else, she never learns from her mistakes and any remorse she’s shown feeling is completely invalidated by her just repeating the same exact mistakes over and over again. Flawed characters who aren’t set up to be antagonists and don’t even receive a shred of redemption or personality just don’t work, and Hina is a prime example of this.<br />
<br />
There are other girls in the show, but they do absolutely nothing for the anime. I guess they’re simply there for some more love drama and harem-esque themes down the line in the manga. But from the anime alone, they contribute nothing to the story. They look cute though, so that has to count for something, right?<br />
<br />
My biggest issue with this anime was that I didn’t enjoy watching it. I was pondering what word could perfectly describe my feelings towards Domestic na Kanojo, and the first that came to mind was “cringy”. I was just so uncomfortable while watching it. Now you might be thinking, but isn’t that the point of the anime? Isn’t it designed to cover discomforting material? While that’s true, the reason why I cringed wasn’t because of the material itself, but of how poorly it was all executed in the anime. Characters weren’t deep, just stupid. They never learned from their mistakes and would just make bizarre choices that would often completely go against their established characters. And the scenarios they found themselves in never felt impactful. They were just random spikes of drama that would never actually go anywhere. Shows are meant to be fun to watch, yet with this one…I just couldn’t get into it.<br />
<br />
Now excuse me as I go and watch OreImo, Eromanga-sensei, and KissXSis, which all do a far better job with the brother x sister relationship thingy than this one.

    Domestic Trash is a god bless, Never have I enjoyed a show to this extent.<br />
<br />
Domestic Trash, as the name suggests, starts as a trashy show, and you will be forced to bear through the first 6 abysmal episodes to see the episode that god itself will question, &quot;For what reason did I even create humans in the first place, one thing I know, it was not so they would create this&quot;. <br />
<br />
The first few episodes are very underwhelming, but as it progresses it goes from trash to potentially a great anime that people can unironically enjoy. But when it reaches the episode 7 it takes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302259">
        a 180 turn and decides to follow it&#039;s first episodes and becomes so bad that it becomes good. It&#039;s like a math formula { f(x) = x^2 + 10x }, as it gradually lowers at one time it would reach a point where it starts increasing, and after -10 it becomes positive and the final result starts increasing, and Domestic Trash has reached so low that it could rival even Evangelion in greatness.<br />
<br />
What I found the most hilarious about this, is that the person behind the story actually thought that it would create dramatic effect if he used methods that even hentai stopped using after 2016. I have been laughing since I watched the 7th episode, and the whole time I&#039;ve been writing this. I don&#039;t know why I ever expected something great of this anime, but my prayers were answered. I don&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone who actually wants something good, but if you embrace the fact that this is trash you would enjoy it to a new extent you never thought was possible.

    Fate is a funny thing. Some may believe in it while others pass it off as a superstition. When someone like Natsuo decided to have sex with a girl named Rui, and later became his step sister, is that fate too? It’s too bad since this high school boy has been in love with a teacher named Hina Tachibana and his life got even more complicated when she is his step sibling too. What the hell is wrong with this world?<br />
<br />
From the way I see it, Domestic Kanojo (also known as Domestic Girlfriend) subscribes to a complicated romance story that feeds off of its drama.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304737">
        The first episode immediately makes us realize that Natsuo is not ready for a serious relationship. He’s pretty much the typical sensitive type of guy who lacks experience with love. Sure, he may have had a one night stand with Rui but what she wanted back then was purely to know what sex is like. Natsuo didn’t feel committed to the relationship either since he’s in love with Hina. Domestic Kanojo is saturated with drama so you should expect plenty of. The most evident is this complicated love triangle between the two main leads – Natsuo, Hina, and Rui.<br />
<br />
The meeting between the first three characters on screen brings out nothing more awkwardness. It almost felt like a moment of social suicide for Natsuo as he realizes the reality of his situation. But hey, everyone loves a secret right? Well, maybe not Rui. In the most direct way possible, she pretends not to know Natsuo and whispers to him to forget about what happened. Despite this, it seems Rui has developed feelings towards him. The show explores a deep degree of puberty for Natsuo and Rui. Being the younger characters, they try to experience what love is. However, the show also makes it unclear who Natsuo is commiteed to on several occasions. In many episodes, I feel like he uses Rui as a replacement for Hina. In respect, Hina also does show feelings towards Natsuo as the show progresses but a big question remains is “will or will they”? However, both sides of Natsuo’s relationship brings about controversy. Hina is at least 7 years older than him. Rui’s relationship with Natsuo would pretty much be designated as incest considering their circumstances. Like I said before, controversy and Domestic Kanojo belongs in the same sentence.<br />
<br />
Outside of the main cast, I confess to say the other characters are far less appealing. For instance, Momo is introduced as the nice and friendly ‘girl next door’ type. It doesn’t take long for her to show interest in Natsuo but the show dumps her without much development whatsoever. Natsuo’s friend Alex is introduced later with a goofy personality who manages to make no impact in the story whatsover. The manga expands more on his character but the anime adaptation treats him like a butt monkey. Perhaps the more important supporting cast includes Shuu, a married man who had engaged in an affair with Hina. There’s a plot that involves Natsuo and Rui trying to get Hina to break off their relationship yet she seems reluctant. Indeed, this show has adultery and isn’t shy to express it. The storytelling themes reminds me of modern day telenovela where romance always seems to have consequences.<br />
<br />
But hey, Domestic Kanojo could make a break for experimenting with love right? After all, the first episode included Natsuo and Rui in a sexual one night stand to experience what it be like. The sad truth is that neither seems satisfied and didn’t grow up from their experience at all. As someone who have read the manga, this 12-episode adaptation can’t even manage to capture the magic of their intimiate scenes. It’s hard to get emotionally invested into any of the main characters when you see how many mistakes they make. While I can say this is relatable to real life relationships, the anime indulges in too much drama. Every episode seems to add drama on top of drama for the sake of….drama. Anyone who is familiar with character relationships in similar dramas can easily see how flawed the characters are. To me, this was nothing less than a guilty pleasure that occasionally bought out some unintentional humor from time to time. By the time I reached the final episodes, I can say it’s pretty much a laughable drama with too many mistakes to fix.<br />
<br />
Diomeda is a questionable studio to be honest. Even some of their work in recent years (Sky Wizards Academy, Unlimited Fafnir, Fuuka) reminds me of production quality similar to the mid 2000s. You’re not going to find high level visuals or realistic animation here. Instead, you’re going to get fan service shoved down your throat in the form of panty shots, boobs, and in some cases, nudity. (yes, there’s an actual uncensored version out there) The manga isn’t shy with its sexualized content either. But for all its flaws, I give credit due for the incredible opening song (Kawaki wo Ameku) performed by Minami. It’s one of the most well decorated theme songs for a drama anime I&#039;ve seen in recent years. The melancholy, stylish piano choreography, and character emotion in this song is phenomenal. Similarly, I also give praise for the performance of the two main female leads – Rui and Hina. Despite being flawed characters, their voices expressions reflects their personalities and emotions rather well.<br />
<br />
Watching Domestic Kanojo wasn’t an easy experience for me even as a manga reader. There are several episodes that made me want to tear my hair out. Relationships in this show is expressed through drama added on top of drama with weak direction. It isn’t one of those fairy tale romances with a happily ever after. No. This is more like a telenovela that’s suited for live action than anime with too much stupidity. Except, it is an actual anime...

    The anime gods have truly blessed us... A boy has a crush on his teacher; that boy has casual sex with a high school girl; his dad re-marries and he now has new family; his teacher and the girl he fucked are now his sisters... Anime is the greatest creation of all time.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound:<br />
Let&#039;s commence with the art style, it&#039;s appealing to the eye with decent character models although it does share similarities with other anime of the same genre. The visuals and animation are consistent and maintain a good quality although it never becomes great or outstanding; the art is probably the worst part of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300599">
        the show and even then, it&#039;s not bad at all. The fucking music is brilliant! One of the best opening sequences and ending sequences of the season thus far with a solid VA cast and a complimenting OST! Sound wise this anime hits the nail right on the head! The art gets a 7 but the sound gets a 9!<br />
<br />
Plot/Characters:<br />
You read my little synopsis/skit at the beginning of this review; so (just like me) you were expecting a low quality story line that relies on ecchi to keep the viewer invested. However, this is certainly not the case, the show relies heavily on keeping great dramatic tension in this fucked up love triangle, which it succeeds in doing! The plot hasn&#039;t blown me away with any major plot twists but it has been consistently intriguing while tackling some mature issues of love, relationships and sex. Furthermore, I really feel as if the MC resembles a lot of people that I know in real life, and this realism makes him more likeable! On top of that, his new sisters are fantastic characters that although they do fit certain archetypes, they are 3 dimensional with problems of their own that you start picking up on as you go through then show! Both the show&#039;s plot and characters get an 8/10!<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This anime has certainly been a ride; it&#039;s been tense and deep, fucked up and funny! But most importantly, surprising! Which is an emotion I love feeling and that is exactly what I received upon watching this. This anime has become one of my favourite anime on Fridays after school to just chill and enjoy watching!

    Hmm, how should I sum up Domestic Girlfriend?  <br />
<br />
Natsuo gets in between his two sisters…..nailed it!<br />
<br />
But Domestic Girlfriend is not your typical bludgeoning of the flaps for the purposes of stimulating that intense surge of dopamine.  Instead, its primary focus is on the emotional aspects of an awkward circumstance of which the “fated” lovers — Natsuo and Rui — have no say over.  It’s certainly not the type of anime that will appeal to the action-oriented crowd or the numerous romcom enthusiasts (although, there are a handful of comedic moments).  No.  This is the type of anime that offers a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304739">
        semblance of realism to a medium that all too often strays away from level-headed, unromantic situations, in exchange for chuckles and anticipated endings.  “Happy-endings” certainly have their place among the droves of escapist-consumers, but the flooding of the market in recent years has made its appeal less desirable; hence, why Domestic Girlfriend is a welcomed change of pace.<br />
<br />
So what exactly separates Domestic Girlfriend from the throng of predetermined, quixotic shows that perpetuate fanciful illusions which rarely come to fruition?  Well, rather than slowly building the eventual relationship between the two “destined” lovers, Domestic Girlfriend showcases a scene in which Natsuo and Rui are seen in a bedroom, after experiencing sex for the first time; yet, their jubilation is noticeably absent.  What is normally considered the pinnacle of consensual relationships, was merely a simple task to be “checked-off” to avoid the embarrassment of being a virgin.<br />
<br />
But copulation done in haste is never so satisfying, nor is it a substitute for a passion-filled, endearing relationship.  A reality that Natsuo and Rui discover in a most unpleasant manner, as their first kiss is done tentatively, without mutual attraction (as Rui’s affections are not reciprocated by Natsuo).  This is not to say that Natsuo does not enjoy their tender encounters — he is a hormone-driven male, after all — but the connection is never fully established.  Fostering an interesting dynamic in which Rui seeks the endearment of Natsuo, while he has his sights set on Hina.<br />
<br />
While branching away from the conventions of cookie-cutter plots and defined character archetypes, Domestic Girlfriend does have a myriad of blemishes that prevent if from being a truly great show.  It seems the staff made a concerted effort to blitz the viewer with a multitude of plot twists and jaw-dropping moments when the bungling missteps of Natsuo, Rui, and Hina would have provided sufficient entertainment in its own right.  Episode 8, with the underwear thief, was just one example of stretching the limits of storytelling too far to “conveniently” pose a new conundrum for the two to deal with (i.e. Alex being attracted to Rui — causing Rui to feel neglected by Natsuo).  Literally every episode has one or two moments that resemble the high level drama of a daytime soap opera.  It’s not quite as egregious as the machinations of Days of Our Lives, but there is a certain superficiality about it that cannot be ignored.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Domestic Girlfriend suffers from an excess of exposition heavy dialogue.  Upon discovering Natsuo’s secret relationship, Rui provides an elaborate explanation as to why she will harbor ill-feeling towards her step-brother.  Ordinarily, though, when a woman is unhappy with a man, she is not as forthcoming with this sort of sensitive information.  Due to a variety of reasons, women can be rather enigmatic, necessitating the man to figure out the cause of the strife without much guidance.  In this viewer’s opinion, if Rui remained silent with her feelings, it would have placed Natsuo in a difficult, realistic dilemma as to if/when he would attempt to mend fences with his step-sister.  <br />
<br />
In terms of the characters, the main three — Natsuo, Rui, and Hina — are thoroughly fleshed, with a preponderance of unique tendencies that enable the viewer to truly understand/empathize with them.  The rest of the cast, regrettably, are relatively weak.  Masaki Kobayashi, in particular, is generally irksome with an abundance of foolish moments that make the viewer want to slap their face or cover their eyes (dude needs to hit the gym to tighten those flabby butt cheeks).  In fact, many of the secondary and tertiary characters were relegated to the sidelines for the mere purpose of comedic relief from the depressing atmosphere of Natsuo’s relationship troubles.  Yet their various absurdities did not meld well with the intended tone of the series.  Ice cream and steak are both delicious, but they are not the type of foods one mixes together.  Neither should one mix erratic comedy with serious relationship issues.  <br />
<br />
All in all, Domestic Girlfriend is a flawed series that attempts to take itself seriously, but far too often does not commit one-hundred percent of the time (or even ninety percent).  Despite its flaws, however, it has a mesmerizing effect on the viewer, propelling him/her to tune into the next episode to see what happens next.  It’s akin to sipping on a cup of tea.  The taste is somewhat complex, albeit acquired.  The experience is pleasant, but nothing special.  And the character is unique, yet nothing revelatory.

    Domestic na Kanojo is a poorly conducted Romance which attempts to integrate dramatic aspects into the show through predictable and unoriginal pathways. The series begins by introducing primary male protagonist Natsuo, instantly is it evident to anyone watching that there is absolutely nothing intriguing about Natsuo&#039;s characteristics. He has no hobbies, no close friends, no quirks, and absolutely no other ambition in life other than to slide into bed with his Teacher.  Like any other troubled teen who has failed to obtain any recognition from their crush, Natsuo does the next best logical thing, lose your virginity to your crush&#039;s biological sister, of course,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302480">
        that&#039;s pure GENIUS! <br />
<br />
As for the pros of the series, it has a really good Opening, quite well done in my personal opinions, anyway here are the cons:<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with Domestic na Kanojo is the potential the series had, the groundwork was laid out for implementation of original concepts but was completely and utterly tore apart alongside the introduction of generic substances. For example, Rui, the first episode of the show portrayed her as this gloomy and composed little girl who gave off the impression that she didn&#039;t care what others perceived of her. Instead, the series decides to chuck this idea out of the window and constructs this shy, socially awkward and introverted little girl who is a loner at school, the male protagonist breaks her out of her shell and helps her make friends. WOW! This is an original concept that has never been done before! To give you an idea how original this concept is, here are some names from the top of my head; Kuronuma Sawako, Tachibana Mei, Furukawa Nagisa, Tachibana Kanade, Tachibana Rikka, Toudou Kirin, the list goes on. This persona is overdone in romance franchise and any attempt to integrate the same concepts can just immediately be rendered as trash. <br />
<br />
The series then attempts to drag in several other females into the plot all with the unoriginal, plain and upright boring characteristic. We have the &#039;girl who has slept with all the guys at school but suddenly takes interest in male protagonist&#039;, overdone by the likes of 3D Kanojo. Oh really? she likes the boring male protagonist for his deadass average personality? OH REALLY? It caused jealousy within his love triangle? OH REALLY? The f*cking girl in the library likes him now? OH REALLY? He has to kiss her to help him write a book???? OH REALLY? THIS CAUSED MORE JEALOUSLY AMOUNGST THE LOVE PENTAGON?? Why is the grown ass women allergic to closing the door before touching herself to the thought of a married man?? <br />
<br />
*ahem* To summarise, Domestic na Kanojo is a melodrama that attempts to integrate overdone personas and manfolds of Cliché, in a desperate attempt to leech aspects of past anime series to cluster f*ck predictable elements into a sad sag of sh*t that is it. If you are currently watching the series, I would highly recommend spending your time elsewhere, because the only thing worse than watching Domestic na Kanojo in your spare time is to watch a production attempt to integrated the aspects of Drama into a Harem.<br />

    Domestic na Kanojo had quite an impression on me when I have first watched it, be it the situations showed in recent episodes is quite interesting, to say the least. <br />
<br />
(Spoiler Free Review) <br />
<br />
Story: 8/10<br />
The story of this anime provides an interesting concept that has gripped me during the start when I first watched it. Essentially it could have definitely been done better, but overall it was still compelling. The story is simplistic in manner and easy to understand, with the concept of love and all, but delivers a complex situation that is hard to fix. The pacing of the show is continuous, The &quot;scenes&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304869">
        I believe deliver their purpose, and satisfaction, if you know what I mean. The individual elements of the show such as the romance between the characters are very interesting for me. The fan service is definitely way up there, so up that it&#039;s better to consider it a soft-core hentai, the drama is favorable as well. The ending delivers an acceptable conclusion for me. <br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
Art-wise the anime has a clean style in doing things, clean on the eyes and straight to the point. The mood developed in this show with this style achieve it&#039;s purpose, and it&#039;s fitting for the story. Backgrounds are clean as well. In terms of character designs it&#039;s very appealing, and matches well with their personalities The character&#039;s are easy to tell apart, but they weren&#039;t as much unique but rather clean. <br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The voice actors for the characters played out well and probably chosen to play that specific voice. The background music played it&#039;s purpose and is fitting, though it wouldn&#039;t really catch my attention when replayed. I probably won&#039;t be listening to the background music anytime soon but the opening and ending songs for the anime is different. The opening song I&#039;d say is one of the best I have heard so far, I can really feel the emotions of the singer and it makes it as much more intimate as it already is. The ending song is quite emotional as well, but more so for the opening to be especially notable. <br />
<br />
Character: 8/10<br />
The character&#039;s isn&#039;t so much as well rounded and isn&#039;t so much as stupid but their actions are quite questionable, the characters for the most part react realistically, in some parts not so much. I related in some things with the main character, but other than that I don&#039;t , but It was very interesting to me and compelled to see what they are going through. There isn&#039;t much character development in the anime, but I don&#039;t see it as much as a problem, but it definitely could have been better if there was. The anime focused quite mainly on the main character and the two female leads, with some supporting cast given some background. The supporting cast played their purpose for the most part, I didn&#039;t really like Hina and her judgement so I go for Rui. The author probably has the intention for making Hina that way being restricted by society and it&#039;s problems. In the future I probably would remember them because they gave out quite an impression.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
The majority of people probably dislike this series because of it&#039;s lacks of depth and personal development and mediocrity, non-anime fans and new people in the anime community or people who doesn&#039;t mind such things will probably enjoy this series or be fine with it, I&#039;d probably re-watch some specific episodes for those &quot;scenes&quot; but I am interested in reading the manga for those &quot;scenes&quot; and probably more in-depth than it&#039;s anime counterpart. I&#039;d like to own this series if I could. The series isn&#039;t really that memorable, there wasn&#039;t really anything unique that i&#039;d probably forget it within a few weeks, but as much of how everything seemed to be not anything special. The anime was still able to play it out in a way that I was still looking forward for the next episode, just to see how it would play out. <br />
Though I really think everything would have been much better if it were to be just a hentai show. <br />

    A lot people gave this anime a 3 or lower score, seriously an anime this good, that doesn&#039;t follow any cliches except for &quot;Kuzu no Honkai?&quot; Frankly for people to gave this a 3 or lower did a big injustice to this anime, and why not? This was a drama theme anime, and if one thinks that live soap operas were much better than this, then by all means watch it..........Stupid. So my ratings for this anime:<br />
<br />
Story- Very Good 8: Like I&#039;ve said this anime doesn&#039;t follow any cliches story plots, though there were some elements in it, but it doesn&#039;t contain something that goes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305002">
        in one direction rather the conflict that exist in Fuji household as two step sisters move in with their mom, because Natsuo&#039;s dad remarries and hold and behold, the 3 knew each other and in fact have a history with each other,and yes I&#039;m talking about Natsuo, Hina and Rui , Hina is Natsuo teacher, and Rui is some that the guy had a fling with and from there the conflict and romance begins. But the nice thing was that in the end, Rui ends up with Natsuo, or at least here in the anime, cu&#039;z in the manga, there were spoilers that points that nobody will end up with somebody.<br />
<br />
Art- fair 6: For starters there isn&#039;t any NTR in this anime, and the swimsuit services weren&#039;t that good. But the usual cliche of them girls wearing the usual eyecandy school uniform is still the mainstay.<br />
<br />
Sound- Outstanding 10: basically I really hate the seiyuu who did Natsuo&#039;s voice Yashiro, Taku whom we know who did Asta&#039;s voice in &quot;Black Clover&quot; AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! yeah, that Bakasta. So why such high rating????? Cu&#039;z that is for the opening theme &quot;Kawaki wo Ameku &quot; by Minami.<br />
<br />
Character-Good 7: Natsuo, I really hate, despite the fact that he and Rui already fucked, the guy still has to play that virgin guy card where he has to act like that she never kissed a girl before , or play this guy who has to be stupid for accidentally seeing a naked girl you know stuffs like that, I mean what kind of fucking did Rui and him did that didn&#039;t involve any kissing and seeing each other naked... If I would have it my way, I would just screw that virgin guy card and simply make Natsuo have that player attitude where he intentionally sees Rui naked, kisses her and do some lovey dovey thing like that of having a affair and not play that nice dumb guy card where he basically ruins Hina&#039;s reputation of being a school teacher. <br />
<br />
Hina, is basically a MILF/ cougar and whore, in my book, she get into an affair with a married man, and who knows, maybe the original creator,Sasuga, Kei,  may have planned to have her meeting different men, but then again she a whore who goes back and forth between Natsuo her tadpole and the married guy whom she fell in love with when she is in high school. Tbh, I&#039;m really disgusted because she is a kind of woman who somehow like to get into messy relationships and one of it is allowing Natsuo to get into her, to the point that such relationship has gotten them more for what they&#039;ve bargain for. <br />
<br />
Rui- If you ask me for such score it was basically for her, cu&#039;z I kinda feel bad that she could be a good wife material for Natsuo, but unfortunately, spoiler both from the manga and other site info suggest that she&#039;ll never be with him, too bad, Natsuo is not the type who wants a good wife material , rather he prefers MILF&#039;s than to his own level.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment- Very Good 8: Despite the fact that seeing Natuso preferring to go with a MILF like Hina than to Rui disgusts me, I still find this anime very moving. That, as one episode ends, I can&#039;t wait to what will happen next. Also there is that thing in me where I hope Natsuo will drop Hina for Rui, but in the end Natsuo reluctantly ends up with Rui, in this anime only, for all we know he still has a thing for that MILF/ whore Hina.    <br />
   <br />
<br />
Overall- Great 9: I don&#039;t usually go that high, but damn this is a GREAT drama anime, and any body who rates this overall a 3 or below, Screw them!!!! <br />

    DISCLAIMER: Let us stop being immature and call sth trash irrationally. Let&#039;s look at DomeKano from a new perspective.<br />
<br />
I hope that you, the potential viewer, who hasn’t written DomeKano off as trash, who hasn’t let the appalling state of MAL reviews affect you, will take some time to read what I have to say.<br />
<br />
Before we know it, it becomes evident for us that as humans, we better find ourselves in love with another, traditionally from the “opposite” gender. This love is supposed to be qualitatively different from all other kinds of love that we either receive, give, or partake in. For instance, this love cannot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339961">
        be an infatuation, cannot be driven solely by lust, and hopefully(?) must have to do with a connection, of the ethereal kind. And when you do find yourself engaged in such a “romantic” relationship, do not hesitate to tie the knot and create a new family. But hey, how is this love different from the one between you and your parents/siblings/relatives? And why is it different? Why were you searching for a different love in the first place? Wait, do you even love anyone?<br />
<br />
At its core, DomeKano is an anime that brings to light, the status of human relationships today by aggressively challenging the many social norms that most of us have come to accept as “natural”. But note that DomeKano does not intend to be a seinen anime that one-sidedly uses itself to make a case for its ideology. DomeKano is very visibly, a romance-drama, very much like KimiKiss and Y. <br />
<br />
Natsuo in as aspiring novelist who has had feelings for Tachibana Hina, who is a teacher at his school. Offhand, his countenance belies his meek and empathetic demeanor. Telling himself that his longings will never be reciprocated, Natsuo ends up having sex with the intriguing and socially awkward Tachibana Rui, after a mixer. So he is genuinely surprised when his father tells him that he’s about to marry Tachibana Tsukiko, who happens to be the mother of Hina and Rui! With time, we see that Natsuo is a very sensitive character who is not afraid to support others and that the socially awkward Rui is adorably sincere in her ways and has a strong sense of agency that leads her to assert her emotions proactively.<br />
<br />
The characters in DomeKano do not shy away from communicating via physical contact - something that generic romance anime seem to decorate as a trophy, to be received at the culmination of invisible exchanges, strenuous inter-personal issues and maybe a couple of heartbreaks. There is however, NO fanservice in DomeKano.<br />
<br />
With a stellar voice-acting cast and a gorgeous OP, the production team displays its sincere attitude towards the material by valuing character animation and composition.  Do not expect something of “Yesterday wo Utatte” level here. But nevertheless, Ide Naomi, together with Ihata Shouta, has done a splendid job with the opening and character design. Maho Takahashi is responsible for the intricately detailed backgrounds and the general maroonish-pink shades that give DomeKano its mood - erotic, dramatic, melancholic and inviting coming of age. <br />
<br />
Having said all that, DomeKano is not without its faults! The drama it uses is often outlandish and leads to developments that are fairly easily anticipated. Not much attention is given to supporting characters and the whole idea of following the pursuits of an aspiring artist is nothing new when at the end of the day, it is only used minimally to emulate mixed feelings at the coexistence of sorrow and creative processes. <br />
<br />
Yet, the anime makes you ask, what is a family? Why is something socially forbidden? And through the anarchy of its characters, we realize how many things around us are not just social constructs, but also serve the bizarre purpose of controlling individuals and their desires.

    This anime is intriguing. <br />
<br />
On one side, we have a beautiful young teacher, whom the main character is in love with. On the other side, we have a cute, kind teen, who had sex with the main character. Now, which one will he choose? <br />
<br />
At first glance, this seems like a clichè plot since it looks like a harem with a dumb main character. However, you are wrong. This main character, to me, is relatively smart. The chicks from the shows are not dumb and childish girls. Nah. They are mature and have their own background stories. In addition, this anime is not only full

          <span style="display: none;" id="review303053">
        of romance, but it also has hints of family relationships, comedy and intelligence (the genre which teaches you something xd), which is very good. <br />
<br />
Story=8<br />
Since I have only seen until episode 8, I can&#039;t say much, but the plot has truly caught my attention. It is creative and not clichè. <br />
<br />
Art=9<br />
Good 2019 Art. <br />
<br />
Sound=9<br />
Good 2019 Sound. <br />
<br />
Character=8<br />
There are a variety of characters, but only three of them can be considered as main. The three main are very well described and different. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment=10<br />
I am a romance fanatic and a teen (THIS ANIME&#039;S TARGET AUDIENCE), so this &quot;enjoyment&quot; part will be quite biased. Nevertheless, I think that an average person would like this anime, too. <br />
<br />
Overall=9<br />
Recommended, especially if you like romance and are a teen. <br />
<br />
BTW: TACHIBANA RUI-RUI-CHAN IS MY WAIFU XD. Nah jk she is weird but fine. ok.

    Honestly when i saw the anime that was going to be airing this season i thought &#039;huh that looks like the Citrus type of garbage (the meme type or the type that is so bad its good) ,so i thought why not add that to my plan to watch as ill get to it eventually. <br />
<br />
To start with i literally watched all of the episodes back to back (at time of writing 10) because this show is my favourite show i have watched in a while not because its good by any means its just garbage but with a plot that could indeed happen although

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304019">
        it may be a bit exaggerated compared to what would actually happen if this were to happen in real life.<br />
<br />
Now for my opinions on the structure of the anime. <br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
To be honest the story is not garbage but it feels extremely exaggerated ,but it doesn&#039;t feel forced like some shows which draws me in as the story just flows and i don&#039;t know how to put it in words but it just works it doesn&#039;t feel like the 1st half of the 2nd part of tokyo ghoul RE as to me those episodes felt less related then adventure time and i can say for a FACT that domestic girlfriend does not do this each episode feels like you are picking up from where you left off.<br />
<br />
-Art- <br />
The art is what you most likely call standard for a show that comes out in recent times its nothing special but that doesn&#039;t mean that it is bad as its anything from that its not unique but then it doesn&#039;t try to be unique so i don&#039;t personally have a problem with it.<br />
<br />
-Sound- <br />
Let me start this section by saying the OP is an absolute banger and if you haven&#039;t listened to it then i would absolutely as it is personally is a song that i listen to now and i usually just play the same 34 songs on repeat but it may not suit your taste. I also liked one of the OSTs but i don&#039;t remember what episode it was in. Other then that i would say that the sound design was fine with the exception of when the characters open doors as every time i heard it i just thought of the sound when you open a door in Minecraft.<br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
The characters all have their own unique traits and notable features ,even the sisters, which range from the standard things such as hair colour or personality types again i would say that there wasn&#039;t anything particularly special when you compare domestic girlfriend to another show in the same of genre with the same demographic.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
I can honestly not say i have not enjoyed watching every second of this show as it reminds me of the time when i was watching hunter x hunter as there was not a single moment of that show i disliked watching and to be honest i would say that there are very few shows which have given me this level of personal enjoyment and i honestly cannot wait for more of this show to air as it is just one huge dumpster fire of a show which i cannot leave alone.<br />
<br />
Overall i would say give this show a watch as whats he worst that will happen you watch 3 episodes and realise that this show isn&#039;t for you and then drop it but personally i feel like even if you are on the fence about this show being decent then just watch it and find out as i know that not everyone will enjoy a show like this because of the type of anime it is.

    This Anime is my undisputed #1 anime of all time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes throughout my day especially at night I just find myself thinking about the spicccccy story and plot, the amazing characters, the looked down upon love, the twists, turns, loops, the tall and fine glass of wine that is Rui and Hinas Mother, you know the normal things.<br />
<br />
This anime changed my entire outlook on Romantic Anime and Anime as a whole. I used to be confined to just shounen with a little bit of isekai every now and then so a lot of action, fighting type anime but after watching just 1 episodes of domestic no

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312331">
        kanojo I realized that I had no idea about anything in anime and my taste was absolutely terrible and not good enough for anything. But after watching this anime I opened up o other genres and now and fluid between all grounded of anime EXCEPT FOR GUNDAM, NEVER IN MY LIFE WILL I WATVH GUNDAM NOT EVEN FOR MONEY, NO!<br />
<br />
Oh and yes I used 5 C&#039;s for spicccccy because the spice in this anime is to the levels of extreme that surpass the ghost pepper the spice can&#039;t be measured by mere earthly standards, this anime takes spice to a whole new level the story nd plot is atleast 100x spicier than my friends Javier&#039;s grandmother&#039;s Taco&#039;s that I am forced to eat every holiday so as to not disrespect her and let me jist say the next week is not a delightful one at all!<br />
<br />
I absolutely reccomend this anime to everyone in existence. If you haven&#039;t watched this anime you are just missing out and ur life is probably at least 10% more incomplete than it would be if you watched it, an absolute masterpiece in my opinion with amazing characters, artwork, story, sound, etc. <br />
<br />
Please, please, please, please, please! Do not write this anime off just because you don&#039;t like romance or because of the rating or because its new or anything else, not that my word is much but I loved this anime so much I can&#039;t even explain it.<br />
<br />
Oh and Rui is always my #1 Wafiu but,<br />

    Sweet home Alabama, the anime.<br />
<br />
It has ALL the cliches possible, it&#039;s a wannabe hentai with a hentai plot, the characters are awful and the story is fucked up. Yet you keep watching it because somehow it&#039;s SO trashy that it&#039;s good. You keep cheering for Rui to end up with Natsuo, but then you remember that they are fucking siblings. Every single episode you&#039;ll yell loudly &quot;NO, WTF ARE YOU DOING, STOP&quot;. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s so trashy that&#039;s good, that&#039;s how I define this hot flaming garbage. I can&#039;t stop watching that shit. It&#039;s awful, but you want to know what fucked up thing happens next. God

    Why do I feel like people these days are way too judgmental ? Some of the comments regarding this series are just pure exaggeration. Sure, I&#039;ll admit that this definitely wasn&#039;t one of the best I&#039;ve watched so far, but some of the comments are just too much. As for the series, if you&#039;re into unrequited love, I&#039;ll definitely recommend it. And yes, it is on the border of incest as well. This series doesn&#039;t follow the stereotypical romance anime plot. This is gonna be more true to life than you can imagine. The protagonist is a person who is not perfect by any means.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305172">
        He constantly makes stupid decisions that are frustrating. But that&#039;s the point of the series. In real life, you&#039;re not always going to make the right decisions. That is especially true if strong emotions of unrequited love are involved. Not to mention the fact that he does whatever they can to avoid hurting his step sisters. But at the same time he can&#039;t keep his feelings in check. Soon you&#039;ll be experiencing a plot where the characters constantly make stupid decisions based on human emotions, impulse and more often face the consequences. There are genuine moments of human connections throughout the plot. It also shows how powerful human emotions can be. It&#039;s a constant roller coaster of emotions. There are flaws and issues, like most series, but they are easy to ignore. Calling it garbage or trash just because the plot isn&#039;t to your liking is just acting like a spoiled brat. It&#039;s really easy to sit back, relax and bash other people&#039;s work.  Personally i feel that not all the series that come out are for everyone. Different people have different tastes. Just because it isn&#039;t to your liking doesn&#039;t mean you should act all spoiled and just take a dump on it. It really is easy to just avoid it instead of ranting about it, so that sensible people can write proper reviews about it. And even if you feel the need to write about it, there are better ways of doing it rather than acting like a kid and whining about it. Most of the reviews are pure rants and does not help provide any proper information regarding the anime. I may have broken a few guidelines myself and i apologize for that.<br />
Thanks.

    Its the Kuzu no Honkai (Scums with) 2.0 but more scummier and incest driven. Where Scums wish shied away from certain topics and scenario&#039;s, Domestic na Kanojo delivers on those scenario&#039;s. This show is not for everyone, some people will despise it for the reason that is obvious. I mean incest is not something we take lightly in anime specially outside the Japan, where in Japan its understood that its fiction in west, well just ask the Goblin Slayer&#039;s fans how kindly they handled one rape scene that was crucial to the story. One other thing that surprised me that it did not look like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300604">
        a studio Diomedia&#039;s show at all, why you will ask, because animation was smooth and it looked pretty to watch at it, thats why. I just hope the anime keeps up the pacing and does not falter in the way, because pacing of these starting few episodes was weird, the first episode went so fast that I did not realized when it ended and I did not had the enough time to process what was going on, I just hope that pacing problems will be solved in the future episodes. The parents of these children are also not developed in a good or decent way as well, I mean they just play as cart board cutouts for the show, they are just means to further some plot points, which is insulting to the audiences because  those plots points are reason why story is going in this direction in the first place. I just hope they give some time to the parents of the main characters because those parents are crucial to the story as well. I do not have that many problems with the story, I just hope it does not makes same mistakes as Scums wish did.

<br />
However I don&#039;t, man I sure as h*ll don&#039;t. <br />
