    &quot;WE ARE PARTY!&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a curious phenomenon occuring in the entertainment industry, one that blurs the line between what you read, watch and play, and while we may all be familiar with the weird, wonderful, and sometimes downright appalling world of the adaptation, in truth the dividing line between the mediums is beginning to fade. <br />
<br />
Where am I going with this? Well, in recent years games and gaming, especially on consoles, has moved to the forefront of the entertainment industry, and in order to capitalise on the popularity of a given title various production companies and writers have begun to produce adaptations of games that have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27359">
        proven themselves cash cows. One recent example of this is the latest Hollywood release, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, a movie which clearly signifies Hollywood&#039;s desire to make more money cashing in to the current games market, especially after the debacle that was &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; and the recent glut of superhero affairs. <br />
<br />
The problem though, is that game adaptations aren&#039;t really the best source material, especially MMO games.<br />
<br />
Slap Up Party: Arad Senki (or Slap Up Party: Record of the Arad War), originally began life as a Korean multiplayer fighting game called &quot;Dungeon &amp; Fighter&quot; that incorporated certain role playing aspects, however the popularity of the game was such that it quickly expanded to include a more immersive RPG system. Now while the game itself is copmparable to the likes of World of Warcraft, the main problem with any adaptation is that in orderfor it to work, the story would not only have to fit into the game world, but also be accessable enough for those unfamiliar with the title.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Arad Senki seems to have fallen into the same trap as titles like Ragnarok, Ar Tonelico and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, amongst others.<br />
<br />
The story follows a young man named Baron through the land of Arad as he travels from place to place seeking a way to cure his particular affliction, namely a demon arm, which was caused by a curse that affected the land some time before (it&#039;s never clear when). Along the way he is accompanied by a small floating spirit named Roxy, and is later joined by several other companions.<br />
<br />
Sounds familiar. right?<br />
<br />
Like many anime of this kind, this tale oozes shounen sensibilities from almost every pore, from believing in one&#039;s friends to never giving up, and everything in between. The problem though, is that the plot has no real direction, and because of this haphazard approach the story proper takes a very long time to get going. However, even with the tale in full flow, there is still not enough substance to make one take the story seriously. Strangely though, this lack of focus and actual storyline doesn&#039;t impact one&#039;s enjoyment as much as one might think, as there seems to have been some realisation that the platform upon which the entire show stands is full of cracks. That said, these cracks have only really been papered over with a thin veneer of comedy that, in truth, is sometimes a bit hit-and-miss. <br />
<br />
The main reason for the lack of focus is the fact that the anime is based on an MMOG, and because of this the writers have had to fit the story into the pre-existing world, something which limits their creativity. On the other hand, if this type of anime is approached correctly, then there is scope for improvement as the game allows for a phenomenal amount of content and ideas that could be adapted. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s unfortunate then, that this hasn&#039;t been realised, however there is something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing (more on this in a bit).<br />
<br />
As far as looks go, the series is colourful enough, and the characters are designed reasonably well, however there is a comic element inherent in this that may not be obvious at first. The animation is generally pretty good throughout the show, and because of the nature of the series, Gonzo are able to show off a variety of styles, from comic to fast-paced action, something which serves the anime well come the end.<br />
<br />
That said, the show lacks a degree of refinement where the visuals are concerned. While it may be argued that a good portion of the series is stylistically designed to enhance this or that comedy or action scene, the viewer may find that the show has a &quot;rushed&quot; feel for the most part.<br />
<br />
Sound is also pretty decent throughout Arad Senki, with many of the effects being clear and well choregraphed. The acting is good for the most part, however some of the seiyuu really do ham it up, and in all honesty I can&#039;tbe sure if this is by accident or design, as several scenes actually work better this way.<br />
<br />
Arad Senki is generally well served as far as the music goes. The tracks used throughout the show enhance the atmosphere fairly well, however the comedy element means it&#039;s difficult to take the action scenes seriously, even with the ubitquitous dramatic music. The show has two OPs, &quot;Party Play&quot; by Sakura Nogawa and &quot;Sokujin no Pandora&quot; by Nogawa Sakura, both of which are decent J-rock tracks. The first OP is fairly typical with it&#039;s visuals, however the second takes a more innovative and humourous approach to golf (that&#039;s right, golf).<br />
<br />
As for the EDs, &quot;Hateshinai Sekai&quot; by YMCK and &quot;LEVEL∞&quot; by Akiko Hasegawa, they are both made using music from what sounds like an 8-bit or 16 bit game. Of the two EDs, I have to admit that I do like the comedy Hateshinai Sekai&#039;s visuals, which feature the characters in a 16-bit game opening treasures and fighting monsters.<br />
<br />
The characters are on of the issues with the series, as there simply isn&#039;t any real development given to them, and the little growth that does occur is often formulaic and &quot;methodical&quot;. None of the characters really stands out in any way, however it&#039;s not all bad, as while there is a distinct deficiency in this department, they actually work fairly well when there&#039;s comedy about. Rather than focusing on developing the characters, the creators seem to have gone in a completely different direction. Essentially, the characters are treated as nothing more than toys that are wound up and let loose in a given situation, the results of which aren&#039;t always successful or effective.<br />
<br />
I already mentioned that there&#039;s something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing, and that something is the tongue in cheek nature of the show. Where series like Raganrok take themselves far too seriously, Arad Senki has made a concerted effort to add some fun to the mix. While the result isn&#039;t everyone&#039;s cup of tea, there&#039;s enough variation in the anime to keep the viewer interested at the very least.<br />
<br />
Okay, so as a straight forward story the show doesn&#039;t work all that well, however if one treats Arad Senki as a series of short stories rather than one complete tale, it becomes far more palatable, and that&#039;s one of the things that it seems to actually encourage during the early part of the show. Unfortunately, there&#039;s only so far a series can go using this format before the viewer needs something more substantial to maintain their interest, and in this department the show doesn&#039;t quite deliver.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a shame, as the idea of making an MMOG based is a good one provided the effort is put in to make everything work. While Slap Up Party: Arad Senki may not be great, it&#039;s actually a lot more enjoyable than the likes of Ragnarok, and although it may not be to everyone&#039;s tastes, there are occasional flashes of what this show could have been like.<br />
<br />
Still, at least it&#039;s not Super Mario Bothers again :)

    Arad Senki is one of those series that are often overlooked because they do not appear interesting or already received a &#039;Deemed for Failure&#039; stamp the moment the preview crawled its way to the wonderful i-net. Granted, the moment I found out Gonzo was behind this an alarm bell did ring in my head, but I still decided to have a go at this anime. This was not before recalling the wise lesson I have learned from watching Gonzo productions over the years:<br />
<br />
Never put high expectations Gonzo, for it shall ruin your your expectations the most. Instead, expect the worst so it can only seem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review17901">
        better.<br />
<br />
After 18 episodes of Arad Senki I can tell you that wise lesson still applies. Want to discover how I came up with it? Watch Kaze no Stigma while expecting a good show. I&#039;ll be taking the time how long it takes for you to crawl back to me and admit you were naive. Anyways, review time.<br />
<br />
[Story 6/10]<br />
The plot in Arad Senki is kinda based on your default RPG story; grow strong and the defeat the ultimate evil to grow into a SAVIIIIIOOOOOR. In this case it is a demon that has cast a curse over the continent, awakening monsters and causing any people that have witnessed it to slowly turn into Demons. The story focuses on a young man named Baron, who also received the curse and looks for a way to undo this.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with that. I have seen anime series with an overused or boring plot still pull off something interesting. The problem with Arad Senki though is that there are too few plot related episodes, and that there usually are ~5 useless or &#039;stand-in&#039; episodes between them. At the moment I am writing this I have watched up until episode 18 haven&#039;t seen much plot development at all. Only something involving a huge flower. Well this may change later on, so I&#039;ll leave it at this.<br />
<br />
[Art 5/10]<br />
The art is, in my opinion, rather poor but somehow it fits the overall rpg-ish feeling of the series. Not to mention, Gonzo doesn&#039;t have a big budget so this may be the best they can pull off. If you have to decide between a good story with crappy art or good art with a crappy story I&#039;d still go with the first option. The reason why the rating is 5 instead of 3 or 4 is not because I think that is where the art quality stands compared to other series, but because this is a Gonzo series. Their budget is low, they can&#039;t match the better anime companies anymore, they have a wife and kids at home...so lets show some sympathy. &#039;I am a compassionate person&#039; as Hime from Princess Resurrection would call it while adjusting her hair.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t want to get started about the art used in the second OP for the series, so just drop that question.<br />
<br />
[Sound 5/10]<br />
Not much to see here. The soundtrack pretty much fits the overall show with a few RPG battle and &#039;route xxx&#039; tunes, but its nothing too outstanding. However, it isn&#039;t bad either. The tunes go well with the battles and other scenes, so that&#039;s a plus that covers up for the lack of originality.<br />
<br />
[Character 7/10]<br />
A sword user, a melee user, a gunner, a mage and a priest. Now, where have I seen that before...<br />
<br />
The characters individually are a bit boring, but in a group they&#039;re a fun bunch to watch. Baron is the lead guy on a mission that doesn&#039;t mind a fight, Ryunmei is your damage dealer and source of the little bit of fanservice that passes by sometimes, Cabensis is your ranged support that is at the center of pretty much all comical parts with his expressions, Ixia is your mage with a sometimes childish attitude and Jeda is your priest sidekick with the muscles. <br />
<br />
What I also like is the fact the the &#039;bad guys&#039; are not just your average bunch with some insane/evil masterplan that try to stop you. They also get some development which allows you to get a better view of what situation they are in, how they feel etc. Especially after one of the recent episodes that was focused on them (although the main part was comedy again) I really felt for them.<br />
<br />
[Enjoyment 7/10]<br />
Arad Senki isn&#039;t too popular, but it does have its own charm. And that is its comedy. It never fails to give me a good laugh every few episodes. The only problem I have with this series is the fact the emphasizes is a little bit too much on the comedy and useless stand-in episodes and too little on the plot. A 12-episode slot may have been better, but that means they had to go with either comedy or plot development. With 26 eps it is both, and although that isn&#039;t too bad here you can just tell that some episodes really have no real use other than stalling the excitement until the antagonists execute the next stage of their plan.<br />
<br />
My recommendation: watch this show while not expecting anything too special and when you have nothing else to watch at the moment. If you take on Arad Senki with that attitude you&#039;ll be just fine. Even for a Gonzo production.<br />
<br />
Final Rating: 6/10

Do you remember when you were 12 and would watch TV shows while eating your cereals a few minutes before going to school? Those shows often had great vibes. While not always being on the positive aspect of things, what did emanate from them is comfort. Those shows weren&#039;t enjoyable, but you liked watching them because you felt something inside you, something pleasant, something that makes you feel nostalgic for moments you desperately miss. &quot;Arad Senki: Slap Up Party&quot; is all about that. Being adapted to a slightly older audience, it shares the same vibes as your favorite cartoons

          <span style="display: none;" id="review391807">
        from your childhood. Though, by no means is it necessarily made for children.<br />
<br />
I am decently confident that I overrated the anime if I base my rating on its sheer qualities. Nevertheless, there is always that one anime that stands out. You do not know why you love it. The only thing you can say with confidence is that you do not regret watching it. This is how I feel regarding &quot;Arad Senki: Slap Up Party.&quot; As my first review, I will try to structure it as best as possible, so let&#039;s dive right into the review!<br />
<br />
I will kick off the review with an overlooked aspect of any anime in general: the sound design. A great sound design is what makes an anime stands out. To my surprise, the sound design, being decently good and relatively unique, was very repetitive. Not that it is a bad thing. There are simply very few different songs, songs I, sadly, can&#039;t find anywhere on the net. To top it all off, both openings, 1 &quot;Party Play&quot; and 2 &quot;Sokujin no Pandora&quot; by Nogawa Sakura, are excellent. I don&#039;t think any Arad Senki fan doesn&#039;t love the second opening unironically. It is... well... memorable, and I loved it to the max! The endings (&quot;Hateshinai Sekai&quot; by YMCK<br />
and &quot;LEVEL∞&quot; by Akiko Hasegawa) are great. Though, I much prefer the second one. The 8-bit style reminds you that the anime is an adaptation of the Dungeon &amp; Fighters games series. I would add that I haven&#039;t touched any of those games and didn&#039;t knew prior to watching the anime and digging inside its community that it was a game adaptation.<br />
<br />
Talking about the most important aspect of a show that, regardless of the plot, wants to be memorable, it has to be the characters. I am fairly confident that people won&#039;t necessarily agree, but I did like them. Baron Abel isn&#039;t your typical cartoon-ish MC that is either dumb or really bad at what he&#039;s supposed to be doing. No, Baron has his own personality, someone who doesn&#039;t always rely on his friends. &quot;We are party!&quot;: yes, the show does rely upon the meaning of friendship but not in a way like Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh!, to name the most well-known, will. To get back on our protagonist, he is someone who, you feel, has suffered. His life was not a &quot;walk in the park.&quot; Before meeting our other protagonists, he is a bit cloistered, though he deeply cares regarding the nefast impact of the &quot;Kazan Curse,&quot; a curse he, himself, suffers from. Briefly talking about Baron&#039;s group of friends: Capensis, the funny guy, the &quot;women lover,&quot; though not womanizer by any means. He is the gunman and is, let&#039;s say, not the most likable character of the show. Funnily enough, he is an exaggerated version of the standard protagonist of that kind of show. However, I would say that: &quot;take him away from the main cast, and the anime is nowhere near as memorable.&quot; Let&#039;s talk about Ryunmei. Though not as good of a character as Baron in my book, she isn&#039;t there to be the love interest of Baron, nor even Capensis. You will indeed see characters cracking a few jokes on her body, but she knows how to deal with them jokes and characters. Unlike Capensis, she follows a goal, thus adding depth to an already likable character. Ixia is the second girl of the main group and is also a character I enjoyed meeting. If, similarly to Capensis, she doesn&#039;t seem to want to achieve something specific, she has a great backstory and personality. She is a character you learn to love. Lastly, Jeda is a character you won&#039;t see each episode until later in the anime, but he is a nice addition to the crew. He adds that little extra in terms of humor, and very rarely have I seen the main cast of an anime being composed of 5 protagonists. 6 if you had Roxy, but I personally wouldn&#039;t. For those who have watched Yu-Gi-Oh! it would be similar to taking first season Yami Yugi and Yugi as two separate characters. <br />
<br />
After looking at the games&#039; promos, I can definitely see why the DnF fans didn&#039;t like the anime. Not in the sense that the cast got downgraded. It is just that the game cast has no standout personality bar, maybe Ixia? This leads to the scenarists having to create personalities for the few characters of the game taken for the anime adaptation. DnF Capensis fans, I feel sorry for you. As for the rest of the cast, they are your average cartoon-ish characters. Though and again, it&#039;s made for a more mature public, not that the anime is violent or anything, but the jokes wouldn&#039;t be as funny if you were to watch it in the mind of a 12-years old.<br />
<br />
Now regarding what most anime enthusiasts will look after when picking a show to watch: the scenario. Well... this is not this show&#039;s strong point. Without going much into the details, the plot is well explained throughout the anime, and the climax is great if you don&#039;t look too much into the details. It narrowly does the job. However, the whole purpose of this show is more to enjoy taking on a journey with our heroes. Nothing less, nothing more, plots, arcs, and fillers all serve the same purpose in looking at one character&#039;s facet. I would add that I haven&#039;t spotted any major flaw, most likely because I didn&#039;t want to. Again, you watch this show more for the ambiance than anything else. Composed of a few arcs and excellent &quot;fillers,&quot; this show reminds me of Gintama. Though not as great, some aspects of it are similar, especially in the character&#039;s development and how they add one character after another to the cast.<br />
<br />
The genius of this show resides in the perfect balance of cartoon-ish comedy and scenario with the classic Japanese shonen&#039;s characteristics. The graphics in themselves are also a perfect crossover of the western and eastern takes at making shows. There is no show to my knowledge that brings what Arad Senki will deliver to you.<br />
<br />
All in all, do not expect to see the next Gintama. But expect to spend a great time going through the 26 episodes! &quot;Arad Senki: Slap Up Party&quot; is what I would call an experience in itself. Everything is unique in its own aspects. I was lucky enough to like each of them, which resulted in me spending some of my best time watching anime. Needless to say that I have high expectations going into the 2017 remake.

    I watched this show years ago and it was the first “real anime” I ever saw. It holds a special place in my heart and I decided to come back and write a review because of the DFO re-release. <br />
<br />
Ill go ahead and say I gave the show a 8/10 based purely on just how much I enjoyed watching watching it. I wont sit here and defend the flaws that are very much present in this show. <br />
<br />
4/10 Story<br />
There really isn’t a story behind this show besides Baron trying to get rid of his Demon arm and the ridiculous characters he gets to join his

          <span style="display: none;" id="review187333">
        cause. The characters that join him on his journey get a short little arc before joining up and continuing on with Baron. The characters have very little back story but I wanna say they redeem themselves by not being boring and making Barons “party” a very nice mixture of craziness and seriousness. I understand they don’t have much source material with it being a game and all but mi glad they added all the original classes from the game into the amine. <br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
The opening songs are very generic in my opinion . I found myself skipping them very early on unlike most amines were most of the time I sit and enjoy the song and video. The pixel ending sequence was a very nice add that I watched a few times. The BGM was generic nothing to gloat about and voice acting was average at best <br />
<br />
Art 5/10<br />
I wont say much here except it wasn’t bad too look at but I’ve seen Gonzo do better with other shows that have been produced by them.<br />
<br />
Overall all I stand by my intro. The characters are not deep but they’re fun to watch on this very generic story. I admit I am biased since I enjoyed and still enjoy Dungeon fighter online. I think and fan of both anime and DFO should watch this. I think they will to some extent enjoy seeing those original classes come to life and seeing the world of Arad we have spent countless hours in come to life in an anime. Not very well executed and as a standalone show since its  very generic and poor story but being a fan of the game puts it just a little bit higher on my list . Hopefully one day with all the fans of the game there’s a well executed show based in Arad.  PARTY CALL FOR LIFE <br />

    I&#039;m probably being too generous giving this 8/10 overall, but I quite liked it. Before watching it, I heard many complaints. The priest&#039;s certain &quot;habit&quot;, some &quot;Gonzo&quot; company made it, people said it was boring, and just made negative comments in general. Throughout watching it, I heard several comments about how people hated &quot;party call&quot; and a lot of other things. Some of the positive/negative comments people made led me to believe they didn&#039;t really understand the show.<br />
<br />
This show loosely follows the storyline in Dungeon Fighter Online. The show has many of your favourite NPCs from the game, which is just something fun to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31535">
        if you&#039;ve played DFO. GSD definitely looks like he&#039;s able to see, Bwanga wasn&#039;t in here at all, and there are a bunch of other inaccurate things.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... I&#039;d have to say the show starts off horribly. The first part of the first episode is awesome since it involves Roxy and Aganzo. It&#039;s interesting since we don&#039;t know much about them even from playing DFO, just the little hints that they loved each other from some of the comments on newb equipment and that Aganzo is &quot;The Grey Slayer&quot;. The show has a pretty serious tone at this point, which is also pretty cool.<br />
After that, things start to get a little silly and trivial. The show isn&#039;t really going in any direction and they&#039;re just sort of building up a party. I say the show starts to pick up around episode 5 or 6, by which time the party is assembled and we start to meet some NPCs. Now, in a good anime series, the introduction of a new main character would be an extremely interesting episode. Here, however, it was pretty boring and a bit of a grind to get through. <br />
<br />
Baron, the slayer, has been hated and discriminated against ever since he received Kazan&#039;s curse. Every normal person wants him dead. He simply wants to find a cure for it and doesn&#039;t really blame people for hating him; he just tries to ignore them and leave them be. His character was fine at this point... but then they turned him into a gold hearted hero who goes out of his way to save every single person he can despite how he was treated. It was just very poorly written and had no emotion at all, especially how he gave confidence to a little girl who just lost her parents. She was breaking down, but a thumbs up from Baron was enough to make her cheerful and hoping to meet this great guy again someday since he saved their town. Stupid. He&#039;s the main character and he was done the worst... Big mistake. He should&#039;ve been a bit more badass.<br />
Capensis, the gunner, is pretty much just comic relief. He complains a lot, hits on women, gets treated like a slave, gets hurt the most, and nobody cares about his wellbeing at all (or even likes him). I found him to be pretty funny.<br />
Ryunmei, the fighter, was a pretty decent character overall. The show had to sneak in the extremely typical and unfunny joke about a flat-chested girl commenting on her large breasts... However, they actually had a good gag involving her large breasts somewhere in the middle of the series. <br />
Ixia, the mage, was introduced poorly. She was a total brat who was wanted captured. And our party did capture her. Then scolded her. Then... Then they let her go without resolving anything after she deeply insulted all of them. Guess what? They decide to treat her as a precious comrade out of the blue. They should&#039;ve done a better job of converting her to the good side... She might as well have remained a spoiled brat since she only joined them because they accepted her, not because she understood that what she did before was wrong. She&#039;s a pretty decent character after that, though, and it&#039;s kinda fun to see how she gains new familiars/summons.<br />
<br />
Just had to get all that out there... Anyhow, the art takes a little getting used to. The animation is pretty average, maybe a little below average since the shading isn&#039;t too fancy and the animation is still only at this level. The battles are weak. Capensis takes out all the grunts, Ryunmei and Ixia help out with that and/or pin the boss, Baron finishes the boss off with an aerial attack, a single triple slash, neutral wave sword, or (for the final boss) ashe fork. Better than dragging battles on for 3-10 episodes, though, right?<br />
<br />
I found the ending theme to be particularly cool since it&#039;s done in a retro pixel art style.<br />
<br />
Last, but certainly not least, PARTY CALL~! Some people really hated this about the show, but I think it was my favourite part. This really made the show unique and added a good amount of humour. It&#039;s not a kind of humour that everyone an understand or appreciate, though. Some people take it a bit too seriously, but it&#039;s clearly a joke in itself. Some say it ruins the mood of battles, but the pep talk itself is funny and it lets them get the battle over and done with. If it weren&#039;t for the party call, how would you end an even match? Fight till both sides are totally exhausted, then the good guys use some kind of finishing move. Party call skips straight to the finishing move. <br />
<br />
If you like DFO and can find the party calls amusing, then you&#039;ll probably like this show as much as I did after you get past the first few episodes.

    Being a player of DFO from the old Nexon days, I was excited when finding this overlooked anime during middle school (2009). I have watched a few episodes back then and often skipped one or two episodes because I was impatient to see the whole thing but I went back and watched everything in 2015. The story was pretty generic  with the whole traditional character class roles in an RPG like a warrior , fighter, mage, gunner, and priest (a healer that can kick ass). As for the characters, I enjoyed watching them going on about their quest while creating a laid-back atmosphere (except

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250188">
        until the mid to late episodes where everything got serious). Since I was in love with playing DFO (even now I still do), my love for the anime is pretty high up on the charts despite what most people say about it but if I didn&#039;t know what the game is about, I would have given this anime a lower score. Now, should you watch it? I would say yes if you don&#039;t mind the whole cheesy-ness that comes with the show or the whole ridiculous antics that the characters produce. If you&#039;re a long-time DFO fan and just stumbled into this anime, then DEFINITELY watch it.

    Half of this show feels like (and probably is) filler. A few filler characters are important to the plot in the end, but many aren&#039;t. While some of the it is fun and interesting (episode 11), the rest is tedious (anything with the guys who wear pots on their heads).<br />
<br />
Filler aside, the show isn&#039;t really anything special. Aside from some of the colorful characters, it&#039;s just another fantasy-adventure anime where our band of heroes must go somewhere to find something. The show is often goofy, so if you&#039;re looking for a serious fantasy series, I&#039;d look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts:<br />
-The animation often looks stiff and only a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274661">
        handful of character designs actually stick out.<br />
-Jeda the priest needed more screentime.<br />
-I did get some laughs out of the frequent slapstick.<br />
-There was a chibi folk tale episode that was really cute and I actually really liked it.<br />
-Baron&#039;s got nice eyes under his headband (I like his design in general).<br />
-Overall, the show&#039;s fun if you&#039;re looking for something simple and colorful.<br />
-Seriously, don&#039;t think too deeply about this show.

    This anime is a hidden jem: it&#039;s not perfect nor the best anime ever made, but it is worth your time. <br />
<br />
First things first: this anime&#039;s plot is generic and a bit bad; and it&#039;s a shame that the first half of the fist episode is dedicated to set up the plot and introducing characters that are not important until later in the series. <br />
<br />
But the shows knows this, so instead of boring you with the same generic plot of &quot;let&#039;s travel and save the world&quot;, the show focuses on traveling though the fantasy world and the character interactions; and only specific episodes are plot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262110">
        &quot;heavy&quot;, and even in those episodes there are more than enough gags to keep you entertained. Althou, my problem with this approach is that you&#039;ll forget why they were travelling in the first place (but you&#039;ll have so much fun that you won&#039;t care)<br />
<br />
Almost every episode is set on a different city/town and focuses on the adventure that the party has on each location. The location themselves are normal (houses with normal people), but the interesing part of them are the adventures the party in the city: maybe they&#039;ll have to defeat a monster using the power of a pumpking-god, or maybe they&#039;ll do random jobs (like fishing flying piranhas) so to gather money to buy supplies and don&#039;t starve to death, or maybe they&#039;ll have to help a gunsmith to save his sister because he is alergic to the guns he creates, or maybe one of the party members just scews something up and the all the party has to fix the problem they caused. <br />
<br />
But the most important thing about this anime are it&#039;s characters and their interactions: all of them are idiots (with good or bad intensions) and they&#039;re pissing each other off for the hell of it but, at the end of the day, they can&#039;t stay mad because they are all friends that care for each other. <br />
<br />
By the way, this show is a comedy. Without spoiling anything, the &quot;fights&quot; are not real fights... but, at the same time, they are there so that the conflict is resolved. Also, since the last a cople of seconds, they won&#039;t bother you. <br />
<br />
A side note; this show handles fanservise in the good way: most women are really hot, but their boobs are not the reason for why they exist. <br />
<br />
Its visuals and its sound are good: both of them are deliver a good experience but they are not remarkable enough to point them out.<br />
<br />
But maybe you&#039;ll read this review and ask yourself &quot;if this anime has so many problems, why does this guy gives it a good review?&quot;. Basically, because it is that funny! It is hard to review this anime without spoiling anything because the things that heppens in it are hillarious and ridicule! <br />
<br />
If you&#039;ve read this review and you have doubts about watching the show, go to Youtube and watch it&#039;s second opening. It doesn&#039;t contain any spoiler, it is a short adventure that shows how goofy and hillarious this anime and it&#039;s characters are. <br />
<br />
I hope you have found this review helpfull. Any type of feedback is welcome (send them by PM).
