    I see a lot of the other reviews/posts and i am confused as to why everyone thinks miyao is a pedophile, which i really don&#039;t agree with.<br />
<br />
Story/Plot<br />
When i started watching, honestly there wasn&#039;t much i expected because i thought it might be similar to uzamaid, which a lot of people thoughts as well and ended up completely misjudging the whole anime just becaus of the first episode. The story was filled with so many cute and funny moments, every episode miyako evolved more as a person through the hep of hana noa and her sister. The story started out with miyako being a shy Neet

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304353">
        who couldn&#039;t even hold a conversation properly because she was really shy but that all change after she met her little sisters (Hinata) friends, who along with miyako experience something new everyday and as we move on more characters are introduced such as matsumoto and her absolutely cute little sister. overall The story is good, calm and fun to watch. as i said earlier i didn&#039;t have any expectations going into this but i ended up loving it in the end.<br />
<br />
Art/Sound<br />
The art is pretty good and the character designs are absolutely beautiful enough to make u fall in love with the characters. The sound is cheerful and the Opening and Ending go completely with the anime&#039;s cheerful and fun mood.<br />
<br />
Overall 9<br />
It was way better than i expected, everything was so simple yet interesting and i absolutely recommend watching because i enjoyed every singe minute.<br />

    After &#039;Happy Sugar Life&#039; in Summer 18 and &#039;UzuMaid&#039;in Fall 18, I am happy to announce that lesbian romances centering around pedophilia have come to stay and entertain us on a seasonal basis. &#039;Bout fucking time amirite.<br />
<br />
This time around our main lolicon, called Mya-nee, is neither a murderous psycho nor an elite soldier but quite the opposite of the earlier main leads. Mya is incredibly shy and pathetic person who falls in love with her little sister&#039;s friend, Hana and thereafter struggles to impress her and also fights against her own urges to go all out for Hana&#039;s cuteness because cops. I know, Mya having

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300304">
        to refrain from doing the lewd with her lolicrush is the real crime here!<br />
<br />
Hana the loli is rather smart and mature for her age, cool person who only ever loses her rational-thinking when Mya offers her candy or other sweets.... I rate this &#039;realism out of 5&#039;. As we can see there is lots of room for character and relationship development which also create the best/all comedic and cutesy moments in the series... which the show is essentially all about. As a person who is really into that pure cute stuff and also girly lovu lovu, I can&#039;t help but to call this the best thing ever. It&#039;s so incredibly haatowaamingu stuff it&#039;s just riduclous. <br />
<br />
To quickly talk about the production, the seiyuu choices have been great. Little girls don&#039;t have nearly as high pitched voices than so commonly which is all for the better. Mya is just perfect. The art exists solely to make everything about the series more cuter but still doesn&#039;t go overboard and doesn&#039;t become too sweet which is a big problem in series of this sort so often. Good decisions. Highly recommend this show to anyone who tends to like this type of happy shit.

    What.  The.  F—k.  Japan.<br />
<br />
Is Mayako Hoshino a lesbian pedophile or what?  I understand that lolicon’s are far from a rare occurrence; in fact, they are fairly standard in the medium, but presenting the lolicon-infatuation as the focal point of the entire series is just loathsome.  In fact, the entire first episode of Wataten! An Angel Flew Down to Me was about Mayako’s fanaticism in capturing Hana Shirosaki (who’s in elementary school) in adorable outfits from a variety of advantageous angles.  It’s no wonder Mayako has no friends, as the other young-adults must have realized her freakish proclivities and decided

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300340">
        to stay clear of this future felon.<br />
<br />
“But it’s so cute!!!”<br />
<br />
O reary?  Maybe we should investigate your own predilections, hmmm?<br />
<br />
Episode two introduces a cute “new” girl, Noa Himesaka, who entrances Mayako with her uh-dohr-i-bility (I wonder what would happen if Mayako walked into an all girls elementary school?  Schwing!).  Consequently for Noa, Mayako’s favored treasure — my PRECIOUS!!! — is forever Hana, as her exhilaration heightened when Hana wore the same outfit as Noa.  Then, during a board game constructed by the three girls, Mayako revealed her inability to “smile and say hello,” giving further insight into her gauche personality.  But it wasn’t shocking when you consider that Mayako wears a track suit like she’s vying for a role in the Sopranos’ (weird-o!).<br />
<br />
The writing staff attempted to use Mayako’s maladroit behavior, along with the girls’ cuteness to generate situations that would elicit laughter; however, they failed miserably.  The jokes are as non-existent as Mayako’s personality, and with Wataten! being a one-trick pony (i.e. relying on the “cuteness” factor) it dampens the engagement for the audience.  This is the type of anime that you’ll be asking yourself: “what the f—k am I doing with my life?”  But at least you’re not the guy forced himself to watch four episodes to write a review about said anime (because that would suck!).

    What do you do if an angel suddenly comes to your house? sorry, forget about that, I&#039;m just joking. Well, regarding this series, I really like the stories they offer are full of jokes and laughter. Even though this series seems simple, it is very good at carrying the theme, no doubt after asking from various friends, I conclude that an anime does not have to be wide need a variety of packaging to make a masterpiece.<br />
<br />
The art they offer is also very good, but I really like the character design, they can make the characters more attractive and funny, especially when compared to the

        matching voice makes me fall in love with the characters. The opening and closing themes they stretch are also right and fit to arouse a sense of enthusiasm, I really enjoyed this one show a simple storyline that made the audience carried away by the flow of the story.

    When you see this show, 2 things come to mind: The feelings of Yuru Yuri once again (since this is mainly a Shoujo Ai series), and the one of the veteran studios of CGDCT-based anime adaptations, Doga Kobo, back at it again from the similar but decent UzaMaid last season. That doesn&#039;t mean that this has the same quality and presentation as UzaMaid, but it is definitely leaps better. And props to director Daisuke Hiramaki for his debut (overall) directing of Wataten.<br />
<br />
You know it when it&#039;s a 4-koma adaptation, so don&#039;t expect any kind of streamlined story or plot, or rather, plot points *mmm*. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304352">
        lesbian &quot;romance&quot; starts off with the main lead, university/college student Miyako Hoshino. Being a shut-in for most of her life, she is the equivalent of a NEET, just taking into consideration for her growing-up years of chuunibyou-esque habits of cosplay, and avoid human contact as much as she can. Once the 5 elementary students drop at her sights one-by-one, her life gets better and better, with a bombarding effect. And no, before you ask, she&#039;s not a pedo, just a pure lolicon.<br />
<br />
We start off with the loli. Hana Shirosaki, the &quot;angel&quot; to Miyako, introduced by her younger sister Hinata. You know the expression &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;? That&#039;s how fast Hana is sold towards Miyako&#039;s sight (or Mya-nee as Hinata nicknames), free to exploit for her insane pleasures of cosplay. Surprisingly, for an elementary school girl, Hana is rather smart and mature for her age, unlike the other girls (plus Hinata) that we&#039;ll see later. But like any other school girls her age, even she is not spared from sweet stuff, as Mya-nee also knows how to entice her with her cooking! So an exchange made for Mya-nee&#039;s cooking against Hana&#039;s (and occasionally with the other girls) tolerance for Miyako to do her &quot;petting love&quot; stuff. Tit for tat, perhaps! Hinata on the other hand, like any sibling would love their own, is always attached to Mya-nee, in the most of energetic ways. What a powerful young siscon.<br />
<br />
Next, the trio of Noa Himesaka, and class reps Koyori Tanemura and Kanon Konomori! Noa reminds me much of Gabriel DropOut&#039;s Satania, in terms of incompetent &quot;superiority&quot; issues, other than her constant call for attention towards Miyako to see her &quot;superior&quot; beauty in comparison to Hana (but of course you know who wins, each and everytime). Moving into the residence beside both Hinata and Miyako&#039;s home, the first impressions always hit the hardest, and her self-cosplay immediately attracts her blackmailing call, oh wow. On the other hand, it is a regret that both Koyori and Kanon only get a small amount of mentions and screentime (due to their involvement in the OP) as the trio&#039;s (Hinata, Hana and Noa) classmates, and speaking of short appearances, the mothers of Hinata-Miyako, Noa and Koko.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Koko (or Matsumoto as we know her better), she was once together with Miyako in the same class in high school, but for some reason, due to her NEET-like status, she doesn&#039;t remember her much. Despite all odds, she literally is constantly fixing her sights onto Miyako like a stalker since high school (the same way UzaMaid portrays Midori&#039;s obsessions towards Kamoi after their time in the JASDF). Scary much, but luckily it&#039;s all for comic relief.<br />
<br />
Overall, a great use of character cast to flesh out their personalities and also dat sweet, sweet build of relationship bridges. The seiyuu cast for the 5 girls are great, with both veterans and newbies alike. Olivia from Asobi Asobase comes back to voice Mya-nee&#039;s younger sister, not to mention that the main girl Hana is voiced by a newbie (Maria Sashide) as her debut role! Absolutely impressive VA, and hope to hear more from her too.<br />
<br />
Since it is Doga Kobo, it is no surprise that I don&#039;t feel the need to mention how good the art and animation looks like in here. Pastel-coloured-like art and simple buPlt excellent animation all around. The character design (I feel) is one of the best traits to remember this anime, as it is done by Hiromi Nakagawa, who was the chief animation director for the original Umaru-chan and Rewrite Season 2. This is his first attempt at character designing, and I dare say he pulled off an impressive job just taking the 4-koma manga as references and displaying in pure animation.<br />
<br />
On the music side, I can&#039;t say it impresses as it is very minimal, even factoring in the OST. Sure the OP and ED sounds good and looks fine, but when compared to UzaMaid, it has the same degree of energy and generic feel. But good points given for trying to portray the OP with the eventual reveal of the entire character cast (except Matsumoto of course).<br />
<br />
While this season isn&#039;t a haven for CGDCT based series (Endro~! and this series), I&#039;d still agree that if you need a relaxing watch to satisfy your loli hunger, this is one series that I can wholeheartedly recommend, not just for the Yuri relations, but just for enjoyment alone. With that said, this anime had a lot of firsts for the production staff, so I&#039;d say a job well done, and we&#039;re anticipating more.

    From the makers of Uchi no maid, Doga kobo presents another loli fest Wata ten.<br />
<br />
But compared to Uchi no maid, this is much more softer in terms of lolicon parody and to be honest more enjoying in <br />
a heartwarming delightful manner.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around our main characters Miyako and Hana.<br />
One day Miyakos sister Hinata (Best girl btw) brings her classmate Hina to her house, and introduces<br />
her to Miyako and voila, Miyako is instant smitten by this lovely little &quot;angel&quot; looking girl.<br />
Love at first sight, ok quite the cliche moving on.<br />
Now we learn a bit about miyako, she is well quite the introvert university student who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304373">
        is into fashion designing.<br />
Not only she is a great cook, a good designer but also a responsible sister.Ideal waifu material? sure But here comes the fun part.<br />
Her favorite hobby and pastime? of course making up cosplay clothes for little girls. Also after meeting hana and falling for<br />
her little angelic beauty, hana has become the prime model for her cosplay fantasies. <br />
<br />
Now Hana, inspite of her being young,quite the sensible and matured girl,but as always there will always be a weakness.<br />
and the weakness is.... *Drum rolls*, she is a hard core glutton or lets just say foody. She literally is a food hooker.<br />
and i meant it in a good way. She will do anything as long as she is fed good food.<br />
So miyako being a good cook, with her fantasies of dressing up Hana in her cospaly clothes, what else could be the perfect god made setting? <br />
In spite of Hana noticing Miyakos side of lolicon and dressin up fetishes and even kind of repulsing a bit at it, as long as the tasty food <br />
is made by miyako, all is well.<br />
<br />
Next of the main loli trio, we have Hinata. Absolutely 100% the best girl of the show.This fanged loli is the burst of her energy of smiles and happiness.<br />
Her obsessive, cute love for her miyako, especially of her famous trademark name for Miyako &quot;Mya nee!!&quot;, which she says so many times throughout the series,(in a non annoying way that too).<br />
Her world literally revolves around miyako,praising her, wanting to be around and receving mental and physical affections from her just adorable. siscon over 9000. <br />
She just uplifts and supports all characters in a really sweet way and manages to just make the show more enjoyable for viewers in every way with her smile and antics. <br />
<br />
Finally we have Noa, who moved next to miyakos house and well one day caught Miyako cosplaying and quite smugly blackmailed her so that she could wear miyakos hand made dresses.<br />
Noa is well another matured and sensible girl of her age, she has a high sense of fashion and likes to compete with hana on the cosplay dressing scenes,<br />
to prove that she is cute and get attention from miyako in the process, but most of the times unfortunately Hana as she is the prized cute gem for miyako wins.<br />
She is also a quite sweet addition to the trio, she helps miyako at times while dealing in situations with hana and hinata<br />
Also she is quite fond of Hinata especially, and harbors a quite platonic love for her.<br />
<br />
Other side characters are also quite interesting and enjoyable to watch,<br />
The other two classmates of Hinata, Koyori and Kanon. <br />
They both are the Class reps of the class, while Koyori tries to be the dominant,dependable class rep,<br />
its actually kanon whom the class looks up to, as she actually is the most matured, sensible,responsible, calm and sweet matured as Koyori is clumsy <br />
and usualy clutters and makes a mess of her work.<br />
But both of them have a real good friendship and can be seen hanging out together often where kanon usually takes care of koyori. Really sweet and heartwarming.<br />
<br />
Finally we have Matsumoto. The downgraded version of Midori of uchi no maid. <br />
She was once in the same class as miyako, once saw her sewing in economics room with dedication <br />
and instantly became smitten and attracted to her,<br />
Whatever may come, she is obsessed with miyako, and stalks her since high school, with her weird fetishes like popping out of nowhere in front of miyako,making dresses for miyako where she knows her measurement<br />
without ever measuring her, making miyako like dolls,a more of scary and weird dialogues relating to miyako which are all but for comic purposes.<br />
She has a normal, sweet little sister who likes playing acting role with her dog, still oblivious to her big sisters weird habits.<br />
<br />
With all these likable characters, their antics and personalities, it makes up of for a sweet, great comedy and a heartwarming series.<br />
The best feature i find is apart from the all the normal fun stuff, after Mikoyan&#039;s introduction and daily interaction with these girls slowly makes her open up a bit more and express herself more,<br />
and improve upon her introvert and NEET nature, which is really enjoyable and pleasant to watch.<br />
Something rare to watch.<br />
<br />
As for animation Doga Kobo did a great job once again with giving us nice light pastel colors and simple art design with really great animation, especially for a series like this.<br />
Brings out the cute and adorable aspect of the show along with bit of comedy drama parts instilled in between scenes.<br />
<br />
Sound wise,no complains there as well.The OST are relaxing and pleasant to listen to while watching the anime.<br />
Also The Opening and ED are well made.I liked the ED especially, the Little girls singing &quot;Happy Happy Friends&quot; joyfully<br />
at the top of their voices, gives a great delight to end the show on a happy high note. Love it.<br />
<br />
Another nice slice of Life, Shoujo Ai. If you wanna layback relax and watch a bunch of cute girls do some sweet stuff with a nice glaze of fun comedy and Yuri,<br />
then please go ahead and give it a watch. Really well made, Enjoyable and recommended.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Given the recent trend of age gap yuri pairings, it&#039;s almost natural to expect Wataten to follow the same pattern. Even more so when one considers that the most recent version before this was just a season before and also was done by the same studio. But while many of the other age gap shows play up the creepiness of the actions either for horror or humor, Wataten is able to take a more nuanced take on what is happening. <br />
<br />
First things first, I can understand why it can be somewhat uncomfortable for audiences to watch the main character so obviously have a crush on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304358">
        a girl who is much younger than her, as well as see the ways that she expresses that love, but I would also implore them to hear the show out and top watch the whole think before coming to a quick judgement. While some of the actions that Miyako takes are sketchy, I don&#039;t think that is a fully accurate description of her character. While the maid in UzaMaid had her sole purpose defined by loving lolis, Miyako doesn&#039;t. Not only is Hana her first love, which hit her like a truck hits a poor helpless soon to be isekai protagonist, but she also exhibits other passions mainly clothing and fashion design, along with more okatu like interests. Her interest in Hana is just one piece of the puzzle, and one part of her whole character. <br />
<br />
She also is a sufferer of social anxiety and has troubles being in crowds, going outside, or interacting with those that are outside of her comfort zone. In a way her smittenness with Hana is able to override that fear and is able to get her to reach out for once, which is ultimately good for her growing as a character. The show does a good job of showing her condition and how much it ends up effecting her. The ability to just interact with others is a struggle for her and it&#039;s clear just watching her through out the 12 episodes. With desires, flaws and all Miyako is a complete character, and is a quite developed one at that. She manages to grow throughout the season and is able to be more than just an age gap joke. And that&#039;s what I think is so important. As unsavorable as it may be to some, often times love happens out of nowhere for reasons that are hard to understand. And it hits Miyako herself. But Miyako is more than that. She is a real person with real struggles and desires and all of that. She is able to provide the nuance that is needed by being a complete character. I also have to add that despite some of Hana&#039;s more weird quirks Miyako is willing to accept them and enjoy Hana for who she is rather than protecting the image of an angel onto her. She isn&#039;t there just for that image, but rather for Hana herself. <br />
<br />
Furthemore while some of her actions are suspect, there are a lot of her actions that are wonderful. She is a great sister to Hinata, and even before Hana was in the picture she doted on her and gave her all the love that one can really hope from their big sister. Even with Hana and the other girls in the picture, she acts like a big sister to all of them. She bonds with them, she plays with them, and often she tries to help them with whatever they&#039;re trying to do. And as the show goes on, the more things she does to try to help them out. She is a good sister to them and she is a good friend. And it may seem weird to some, friends don&#039;t have to be age restricted. Despite the difference in age there is a true bond there which is very enjoyable to see.<br />
<br />
I talked a lot about Miyako which makes sense given her focus in the show, however she is far from the only great character in the show. The main cast is a lot of joy to watch and each of them have their own interesting quirks. While Hana can be quite angelic in her appearance and demeanor, she has her own weird quirks and odd things she likes that makes her interesting and goes against that grain. Noa loves herself and attention but actually despite that she is a really good friend and is the most aware of what is going on out of the whole cast, even Miyako at times. And while she is not afraid to use what she knows to her advantage, she also uses what she knows to try to make the rest of the cast happier and get them to the conclusion that they wouldn&#039;t be able to get to without pushing. Hinata is a genki-girl that loves her sister a whole lot, and to be fair she is the simplest of the cast. She basically tries to make everyone happy while also trying to be with her big sister as much as she can.<br />
<br />
As one may expect from a Dogo Kobo show the art style is fantastic and really brings out the cuteness of the show. The animation is great and the music is also quite nice. While there can be a few corners cut here and there the general art style is so strong and cute that it is able to more than make up for it.<br />
<br />
Overall these good production values along with the wonderful characters and the growth they have both as people as towards each other makes this a great enjoyable watch, and one that provides the nuance that I hoped to see in it. And while it is able to hit all of the things that one would hope for a CGDCT I&#039;m glad that it was able to use it&#039;s premise and unique traits well to separate it from the pack. It&#039;s not my favorite CGDCT but is a welcome addition to the list of CGDCT that I really enjoyed and would heartily recommend.

    Sigh... some of these reviews. <br />
<br />
Lets get two things clear: <br />
<br />
1. Miyako isn&#039;t a pedofile.<br />
<br />
2. This show isn&#039;t anything like Uzamaid. Uzamaid&#039;s MC foams at the mouth at the sight of any underaged girl.<br />
<br />
Hana is the only girl that Miyako fawns over, not all girls. Yet they&#039;ve slept in the same bed with no problems. Miyako doesn&#039;t attempt to peek when Hana is in the bath. Miyako couldn&#039;t care less when Hana wore a school swimsuit. Miyako was actually the one avoiding Hana when Hana got to close when they in the closet together. They are also able to talk to each other normally. <br />
<br />
Does

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301517">
        any of this sound like a crazy pedofile? Not even close.<br />
<br />
Now that I say that, the first episode is really weird, there&#039;s a disconnect which might throw off viewers watching the show for the first time. During the first episode Miyako is forbidden from taking a picture from a down below angle. That&#039;s where people start getting the pedofile vibes but it was really out of character for her to do that because all of her other actions suggests that Miyako has ZERO sexual interests in Hana. She just sees Hana as super cute like a dog or a cat. <br />
<br />
This show is also a hit or miss for people but if you can ignore all of the loli stuff you can enjoy Miyako trying to slowly progress towards being a functional member of society. The show really shines when the story revolves around her.<br />
<br />
All things aside, Reina Ueda is absolutely fantastic. As a fan, my ears have enjoyed this series.

    (Ok, I will be discussing this shows… pedophilic themes. And I just want to clarify before you read anything. This isn’t a criticism on the people who have made the show and the people who liked the show as people. I am not saying that any person that has anything to do with this show, whether it is watching it or making it, is a pedophile BECAUSE of this show. This is a criticism on the show, not people. <br />
There, let’s get into it)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don’t think I have seen a show that I would call pedophilic. You know, you have shows that have some weird

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304539">
        scenes with characters that look like children. I.e Dragon maid, Bakemonogatari (I haven’t seen the show, but I know there’s a loli in there) etc. But I wouldn’t call any of those shows pedophilic even though pedophiles can enjoy those shows sexually. <br />
The only scenes with Kanna that could be sexually suggestive are scenes where the two characters have the same age, and (as far as I am aware) Shinobu doesn’t take part in sex with an adult. <br />
But I think Wataten is the closest to loli hentai that I have seen. <br />
<br />
The synopsis of “Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me” is that Miyako, a socially anxious college student, meets her little sisters new friend Hana, who she is instantly amazed by. Through Miyako’s fantastic baking, she makes Hana do cosplays while Miyako takes pictures of it. <br />
Miyako basically falls in love with a child, and makes her do suggestive photoshoots (From my point of view anyway). <br />
Now, you could say that Miyako just found Hana to be extremely cute. There isn’t any sexual situations in the show. it isn’t a hentai or an ecchi show. But even though it is never stated that Miyako fell in love with Hana, looking at some of the scenes really point at it. <br />
Now, this is the worst part of the show. every episode I was waiting for Miyako to break and just rape the girl. Doing that would actually be like a really shocking turn of events. Doing a madoka magica and make everything dark as fuck. <br />
Now that’s what I would’ve wanted, but what I got was Miyako and her baby harem going around town doing all sorts of stuff. <br />
They reference the fact that Miyako is really creepy, and the fact that they could call the police. And while that’s probably the best part of the show, where it is a little self aware of what it is, the problem is that they say it so many times, but they never do it. The perfect ending would’ve been Hana finally calling the police and then a shot with Hiyako in jail. But again, it doesn’t happen. Hana definitely knows that what Miyako is doing is wrong, but she never does anything. In the end, Hana-chan seems to be comfortable with Miyako, but she should be scared out of her mind. Miyako, an adult, has been using a child to do photoshoots. <br />
When the Hana’s parents hear what Miyako has been doing with their daughter, their not worried, their not angry. they were excited…<br />
<br />
And I just want to say. The concept of having the main character being a pedophile isn’t bad in nature. You can do some really interesting stuff with that, like showing that even though someones a pedophile, they can resist their urge to fuck children. You can convey a message that I have NEVER seen in any medium ever (Though, I would be surprised if it hasn’t been done before).<br />
 <br />
But what Miyako does, it doesn’t show that. What Miyako does is inexcusable. She isn’t worthy of all the attention and respect that she gets.<br />
There is one episode where Miyako is revealed to have her birthday on that very day. None of the girls in her harem know this, and therefore comes up with a gift. This gift is a ticket to do whatever she wants with one of the girls. And when Miyako understands that Hana is one of the people that she can make do whatever she wants, she does This face. Can you honestly say that that face doesn’t have the intentions of fucking Hana.<br />
<br />
Ok, you can probably tell that I’m getting quite a bit annoyed while writing about this show. But I have to say, there were things to enjoy. The lineart and coloring were both pretty solid, it was a fairly cute show when Miyako wasn’t being a creepy and there were actual scenes that I didn’t want to die from believe it or not. <br />
But I can’t give excuses to this shit. I can forgive one-sided characters. I can forgive on-the-nose dialogue. I can even forgive trash visuals if everything else is fine.<br />
But I cannot say that the fact that we were supposed to relate to and empathize with an active pedophile didn’t bother me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I think this is a shit show, but manages to be harmless. I know I’ve talked about it’s pedophilic themes a lot, but the show doesn’t say that it’s okay being attracted to children. Miyako is repeatedly shown as a creep. And this is fine message-wise, but not writing-wise. <br />

    I feel I could write a whole book about this show, I can&#039;t describe with words how happy this anime makes me.<br />
<br />
From experience I can say it&#039;s hard to write romance, it&#039;s also hard to write age gap romance between a 10 and 20 year old, and it&#039;s even harder to sell it to the audience.<br />
<br />
But they did it, they accomplished it and the final result is the most wholesome and heartwarming romance ever animated by Japan.<br />
<br />
The key to success is to make the characters believable and entertaining at the same time, our protagonist isn&#039;t over the top and the love interest naturally wasn&#039;t into

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304416">
        the whole thing at the start, on the contrary even though the older girl was really shy and lovestruck like a pure maiden, the young one still had a hard time even trusting the cosplaymaker.<br />
<br />
But like the human characters they are, there was character development, things didn&#039;t stay static, progress was made and the characters grew, both as a person and to each other. And the show left pretty clear they complement each other very well, one has terrible fashion sense and it&#039;s essentially useless at homechores while the other has big social anxiety issues, and they motivate each other to work on these flaws, depending more and more on each other while the show goes on, their dynamic getting better while at the same time growing together.<br />
<br />
It was proven why the art direction and sound were 10/10 thanks to the final episode, but everything else was 10/10 thanks to our main couple.<br />
<br />
There are all kinds of couples in media, couples with a strong bond that weren&#039;t shown how they got so close but still leave a big impression like Kanon x Koyori, couples that are pure concentrated sugar that depend on fluff more than on substance like Noa x Hinata, and couples that we see grow from nothing into something big with the biggest focus and evolution of their romantic feelings like Miyako x Hana.

    OMG I cant get over how much I love this series its the pinnacle of moe in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita has some of the most cutest moments I&#039;ve ever seen in anime period. The cute relationship between Miya-san and Hana-chan was really nice to see after watching UzaMaid the previous season.<br />
<br />
The absolutely adorable sisterly relationship between Miya-san and Hinata was one of the huge sellers for me of this series which is beautiful as we don&#039;t see many anime that focus on sisters.<br />
<br />
The absolute wholesomeness of the series is adorable all the way throughout particularly the last episode of the series which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304394">
        is one of the most beautiful episodes I&#039;ve ever watched in anime and an amazing way to end the series. I cant stress enough how adorable this series is.<br />
<br />
The Music in the anime OP and ED sung by the main characters also adds to the adorableness and makes the characters even cuter than they already are. Also some of the insert songs towards the end of the series are so beautifully moe its breathtaking.<br />
<br />
The characters are absolutely lovable to watch and there&#039;s never a boring moment in the series or a time your being killed by cuteness. Miyako&#039;s shy personality leads to some hilarious moments and some adorable reactions as well as the other characters tease her.<br />
<br />
Overall Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! is the moe anime to go to if you want cute girls doing cute things I highly recommend it if you like your cute slice of life. Also if your a yuri fan you&#039;ll definitely love this series as well.<br />
<br />
Score 10/10 absolutely loved it and will guarantee re-watch it very soon.

    Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! goes off in the wrong foot by giving us an alienating premise and something that even caught LA unawares as LA didn&#039;t even see MIYAKO in the anime poster before LA started watching the anime itself as LA thought this anime was gonna be in a similar vein to Slow Start, geez LA must be getting blind or something.<br />
<br />
So LA will say this before anybody gets any ideas about the premise, the first episode itself gave off a VERY bad impression of the anime as a whole about Miyako, she&#039;s a recluse who likes one of her younger sisters friend

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304408">
        of Hana Shirosaki voiced by Maria Sashide, but she KNOWS her feelings towards Hana is wrong and not appropriate at all but adores her anyways, let alone the fact that Hana herself is the more dominate one, keeping Miyako in check and stopping her from doing anything shady. The anime itself isn&#039;t even really pervy in anyways and the worse it got was that Hana and the rest of the cast gets to dress up in non fanservicey costumes for the majority of the anime. Hell Hana finds ways to utilize and even manipulate Miyako in order to get snacks and food from her as her family doesn&#039;t allow Hana to eat those kinds of things and by the end of it, Miyako and Hana&#039;s friendship is just that a mutual friendship with no romantic vibes at all.<br />
<br />
Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!&#039;s characters are ok but falls under the clicheness with certain characters having a running gag here and there. Of course Miyako and Hana has them too. Miyako for her cosplaying the rest of the cast, Hana&#039;s obsession with junk food, Miyako&#039;s younger sister  Hinata voiced by Rika Nagae is the hyper genki character that clings onto Miyako, Noa Himesaka voiced by Akari Kito being the semi-narcissistic kid and wanting everyone to call her cute, a conflict in which Hana trumps Miyako&#039;s eyes and Noa get annoyed by. This for the mos tpart is the basis of the comedy in Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! just with some different settings and situations here and there and it has  a mark of repetition at times with it&#039;s characters as a result. <br />
<br />
The minor characters do come in here and there, like Koyori Yanemura voiced by Hitomi Ohwada, a friend of Hana and Hinata who thinks she&#039;s a great leader and can do everything but fails and her best friend Kanon Konomori voiced by Naomi Oozora who&#039;s the polar opposite and is extremely reliable and that&#039;s their entire gag. There is one other character to note and that&#039;s Koko Matsumoto voiced by Lynn who&#039;s is actually the perceived &quot;Miyako&quot; as she stalks, takes picture and finds EVERYTHING about Miyako and yeah that&#039;s her entire gag as well.<br />
<br />
The animation done by Doga Kobo is expected moe and this is no different right down to the character designs and background work. LA REALLY doesn&#039;t have much to talk with the animation it&#039;s really is boilerplate Doga Kobo with their quality and expected moeness.<br />
<br />
Voice acting, well seeing Reina Ueda as Miyako was kinda half-expected decent as the recluse yet slightly shy genki character to be honest, with Rika Nagae as her hypergenki clingy younger sister and Maria Sashide as the stoic almost deadpan Hana rounding the chemistry between these three seiyuu&#039;s working off nicely oddly enough. The voice cast was ok..maybe too moe at times...but just ok.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s the word LA will leave off with Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!, it&#039;s just &quot;ok&quot;, the comedy is there with a few laughs but some of the running gags implemented towards the main cast does make the punchline easier to figure out or just cliche in the situations the cast goes through and no even for a show like this, the moe doesn&#039;t help if the comedy is this repetitive and predictable. Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! may seem alienating ESPECIALLY it&#039;s first episode but even going through the entire anime, it was harmless as a result but it&#039;s comedy needed some work with the premise it was given to us, but in saying that...can you?. Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! isn&#039;t garbage level material, it just played itself VERY safe.

    If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it. Or so the saying goes.<br />
<br />
The CGDCT genre has never been particularly original for the simple reason that it doesn&#039;t have to be. It&#039;s a stable concept, and as long as it has likeable characters it&#039;s bound to be enjoyable pretty much by itself. Nevertheless, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve come across a case of the same anime studio (in this case Doga Kobo) making almost the same anime two seasons in a row. However, that is more or less the case here with Uzamaid from last season and now Wataten from this one.<br />
<br />
Now that is not to necessarily say

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304349">
        that is a bad thing. In fact I think both these shows are quite good, but the similarities are undeniable. They&#039;re both CGDCT anime about a girl in her twenties fawning over a certain elementary schoolgirl to an unhealthy degree, as well as the various hijinks that play out between them and the other kids around them. As if that wasn&#039;t enough, in both series we also get a secondary adult female character introduced about halfway through the show who takes the role of an even more obsessive and stalker-like person who is gunning for the main girl instead. I&#039;m not sure what caused Doga Kobo to be so damn sold on an idea for a CGDCT shows that they decided to book in two nigh-identical premises on their schedule two seasons in a row, but alright then.<br />
<br />
That being said there are certainly some notable differences between the two though. In Wataten&#039;s case this becomes more apparent after a couple episodes when more characters are introduced from the elementary school. From this point onwards it starts feeling more like a traditional moe comedy as there is more focus on the lolis and not quite as much about Miyako&#039;s obsessiveness as it is in the first few episodes. You could argue the show becomes less original from that point onwards but I still think it became better in the process. The typical CGDCT formula has survived this long for a reason after all: it just works.<br />
<br />
The characters are quite likeable in general. Other than the reserved closet otaku Miyako with her slight lolicon tendencies who stars as the anime&#039;s MC, we&#039;ve also got her cheerful but airheaded little sister Hinata, the sweets addict Hana (who&#039;s the target of Miyako&#039;s affections), as well as the ego-centric mood maker Noa making up the core of Wataten&#039;s cast. They have a lot of chemistry between them which is probably the biggest charm point of the show, and in my opinion Noa is the one who stands out the most and carries the show to a decent extent. Her straightforward and smug attitude is always a joy to watch. There are also some side characters that enter the show a bit later as mentioned previously, but they don&#039;t stand out as much on their own, instead they help to transition the general structure and theme of the anime as a whole, but it is only for the better.<br />
<br />
Overall, Wataten is not a particularly unorthodox anime in the end. It really is just another CGDCT show really, but the convenient thing is that… well, being &quot;just another CGDCT&quot; is kind of a good thing, so it&#039;s totally worth watching anyway. Just try not to replicate too many of Miyako&#039;s fantasies after watching it or you might find the police knocking on your door one day.<br />
<br />
PS: It also ends on an absolute high with one of the best single episodes you&#039;ll see in a moe show, so it&#039;s kinda worth watching just for that if nothing else.

    you&#039;re stupid if you listen to these negative reviews calling Miyako a pedo that&#039;s more a problem with you then it is her or the material. what watenen does is take the tried and true formula of cute girls doing cute things and turns that knob up to the point that it fucking snaps off, when I put this show in my plan to watch list I was like okay yay another &quot;yuru yuri&quot; &quot;new game&quot; &quot;k-ON&quot; clone I can get some fun out of but what I got was so much better than a mere clone dear reader what I got was fucking diabetes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review305188">
        from how sanguine and sickeningly sweet it is from beginning to end its an excellent show and then that finale that finale is what separates it from so many other shows its audacity to end the show with a musical is just the most magnificent closer to a wonderful series I feel like a 10 am I being too lenient or too hasty nawh i enjoyed this shit I think you will too if you give it a chance it will have you smitten with how charming and delightful each member of the cast is.

    A lot of this reviewers are really quick to say that this cosplay cute stuff loving shut in is a pedophile.<br />
<br />
Miyako had many chances to do ANYTHING to this girls yet she just played and messed around with them instead of sexually harassing them. She just likes cute stuff and proceeds to dress up and take pictures of the girls which is something I&#039;m sure a lot of parents do, she&#039;s not their mother but still a cute loving neet that uses her hobby to play with the girls. She means no harm even if it&#039;s slightly creepy, if liking something cute and wanting to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316739">
        cuddle it makes you a pedophile than this world is pretty bad. It&#039;s just a moe yuri-ish show, calm down.

    I&#039;m gonna make it plain. I&#039;m disgusted by my self and others for watching this show. The story revolves around a pathetic big sister who has a crush on her little sisters friend who is pretty smart and reacts realistically to a weirdo. Therefore the big sister uses candy to lure in the child who didn&#039;t even wan&#039;t to be there to begin with. <br />
I think normalizing this kind of behavior is extremely immoral and disgusting. I laughed maybe one time during the whole episode, there is nothing cute or funny in this show. I see people writing comments about how the show &quot;redeems itself&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338173">
        in other episodes but I seriously doubt that and I have no wish to find out. The whole setting is just fucked up and weird. Beyond that, it&#039;s just sad. Sad to see such a pathetic human being falling in love with a kid. People who defend/like this anime scare me.

    Maybe all of you just compare this anime with UzaMaid from the similarity. But actually there&#039;s something different. UzaMaid focused about how Misha development (the loli). In this anime it focused in Miyako which the lolicon. This make a different approach in story.<br />
<br />
The story that very light and entertaining. But I think most of you thing, &quot;Is she lolicon? Why is she not just say or admit it?&quot;. As I said early, this anime focused on Miyako, not the loli(s). To make story continued means need more development, not end to end. So yes it can&#039;t be that easy to say &quot;Hey I&#039;m lesbian lolicon,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301859">
        marry me please!&quot; and thanks to not this straight I want to watch another episode to see the development.<br />
<br />
For art, I think good enough for &#039;daily live anime&#039;. But nothing special in the moe-moe. But the art really describe character on this anime. Like Hinata has little fang (make me think she&#039;s so energetic and easy going), Hana has a flat angelic face (typically mature) but some time can be sparkle (interested with something), and many more.<br />
<br />
Sound.. well.. I love this kind of anime so I really enjoy lolis sound (please do not call FBI).<br />
<br />
All of it make me really can enjoy this anime, and that&#039;s the point of this anime for sure. But this only personal reference. Cuz if you do not like &#039;every day&#039; anime, you can&#039;t enjoy it. If you really disgusted by lolicon, this anime ABSOLUTELY HARAM, I mean just do not watch it.

    Before any close-minded, typical westerner action-filled anime fans drop this after five episodes and give it a two and leave an irrelevant opinion, let me explain why this series works for me:<br />
<br />
Is this a lolicon/pedophile anime? No, absolutely not and any counterargument that bashes this series for that reason should be ignored. In fact, this series has a total of zero scenes that suggest any innuendos, which includes the first episode&#039;s infamous &quot;yamate,&quot; scene, which has no perverted intentions on Miyako&#039;s part and is a comedic juxtaposition from Hana&#039;s side. Obviously there are scenes that will make an average viewer raise their eyebrow, but you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304663">
        have to realize it&#039;s not intended to be some pedo-yuri garbage, but more about how Miyako&#039;s actions are not normal and how she may not be aware. I could talk about specific scenes that are polarizing, however, I don&#039;t want to spoil anything for any new watchers.<br />
<br />
While this is a slice-of-life with no substantive plot, this entire series deals with the subject of Miyako being a shut-in and her bizarre methods of coping with social anxiety. I love the fact that throughout the whole series, Hinata and her friends are trying their hardest to coax Miyako out of her shell. This isn&#039;t me trying to provide a stretch to find of a plotline for this series. You definitely don&#039;t need a thinking cap for this series, but it&#039;s a little beyond just a typical cute, moe slice of life and provides substance when it branches off in to Miyako&#039;s social issues.<br />
<br />
This anime isn&#039;t perfect by any means, because at the end of the day it&#039;s still a slice-of-life, however, it makes up with the memorable scenes, lovable characters (Hinata, Kanon and Hana are probably my top three), the great art style, the music, and the overall enjoyment of the series.<br />
<br />
The only episode that fell short for me in terms of pacing was episode four. My favorite episodes, by far, were five, six, eight and nine. This anime is great in my opinion. Don&#039;t let the negative reviews deter you from picking this up. It&#039;s a heartwarming show, just try to look past the half-handed, negative lolicon, woke overtones that critics try to paint this show with. It&#039;s nothing extravagant, but it&#039;s a wholesome show that doesn&#039;t deserve the hate it&#039;s getting.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll leave it at that. I enjoyed the hell out of this and I hope we get a second term. I&#039;m very happy that we&#039;re at least getting an OVA :)

    I&#039;ve seen a lot of ppl freak out with the whole &quot;lolicon-yuri&quot; thing and it&#039;s fair to think like that but I feel that some of that people didn&#039;t got too far into the series or they are too close minded.<br />
<br />
This is a story about a socially awkward girl called Miyako, she has no friends and zero social skills. Your typical hikkikomori. That by itself it&#039;s pretty plain but as the show progresses you can see how by meeting this Hana girl and the rest of the cast she slowly but surely grows up and she becomes... a little bit less awkward.<br />
<br />
Now then, why I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306254">
        think it&#039;s great.<br />
In most shows the hikki character is made fun of and it&#039;s a perv, an idiot, a trash of a human being. There&#039;s some of that kind of humor here but here it&#039;s handled completely different. The characters accept Miyako and they understand her in a lot of ways. Ofc they try to take her out of her shell but whether or not they succeed at it it&#039;s up to debate.<br />
Taking from my personal experiences and my own personality I understand Miyako and you should try to do it too.<br />
<br />
I just love how she&#039;s treated overall, they don&#039; force her to come out, she just get little pushes here and there but most of the work is done by Miyako herself.<br />
This show isn&#039;t about &quot;Let&#039;s fix the Hikki&quot;or &quot;let&#039;s make fun of the hikki&quot; and more about &quot;Let&#039;s have fun with the Hikki&quot; &quot;Let&#039;s love the hikki&quot;. It actually shows you how you can be friends with a person and even tough she&#039;s weird or whatever she&#039;s genuinely a great person/character. It&#039;s just heart-warming most of the time.<br />
This show it seems like started a discussion on &quot;real life&quot; related subjects but hey, if a show can make us think about serious stuff way after it&#039;s finished and tackles such complicated subjects in such graceful way I think it deserves some attention.<br />
<br />
Finally I think it&#039;s good to remember that this is an anime. It will have a lot of exaggeration but if you look at it it&#039;s a beautiful story about understanding and... it&#039;s just plain fun you know. I didn&#039;t feel like they forced the humor or the romance or any of the subjects, everything was handled pretty smoothly.<br />
<br />
So, get yourself confortable and keep an open mind. Give it a watch, I bet there will be something you will find enjoyable.<br />
 <br />
==========================================================================<br />
<br />
Now for everybody&#039;s favorite subject. Pedophilia. This is a personal opinion or whatever so be warned (is not like ppl ain&#039;t throwing opinions here). If you don&#039;t want to read this is ok, that&#039;s why I separated this from the rest of the text but I&#039;d like you to give it a read since I feel like it&#039;s closely related to the plot of the whole series and the several subjects it tackles.<br />
 <br />
So, she&#039;s like 10 years older than Hana-chan but I think we are forgetting something, we are not her. Most of us will never understand her situation and we should at least try to understand not just her, any person in her situation (Hikkikomori).<br />
<br />
What if you haven&#039;t got any friends at all until you are 18-20yrs old? Is not like ppl just threw you away and you grew resented to the world, no, you just can&#039;t fit in and up to a certain point you don&#039;t really want to fit in. Then, someday you meet somebody who makes you feel all weird and tingly?<br />
Is not like &quot;she&#039;s a pervert and a pedophile&quot; is more like she doesn&#039;t know what life or love is. <br />
Seriously, when you get to feel that weird sensation called love a lot of times, even as adults, we have no idea what to do with that feeling, it just hits you hard like a truck and you have zero control of what it will trigger it.<br />
An older person perhaps? a childhood friend, a little girl, somebody the same sex, it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />
Shall we seriously hate on somebody just because it feels like that? No. <br />
Most importantly, she does nothing that would hurt anybody, not even the little girl she fell in love with and she does acknowledge there must be something wrong with her, she does suffer from her own feelings.<br />
Sure. she&#039;s a little creppy sometimes but we get to see that she tries her best to go against it.<br />
<br />
Now, let&#039;s suppose they indeed fall in love with each other and they want to be together, well it&#039;s Illegal for sure but I&#039;d argue that if they manage to stay together until Hana turns 18 and they can legally marry everything will be ok and besides, 8 or more years of Miyako waiting and both of them still feeling in love with each other after the teenage years is something you don&#039;t see anywhere.<br />
A lot of ppl would feel disgusted by the mere tought of this idea but... Miyako is such a good girl... I wouldn&#039;t mind somebody like her to be around my daughter cuz I&#039;m sure she will treat her better than anyone else.<br />
I&#039;m not an expert on this or relationships, I am pretty awkard myself and I&#039;m not the best when it comes to &quot;love&quot; stuff but if two beings find each other, fall in love and treat each other with love and respect, who I am to judge?<br />
<br />
I know this is a touchy subject and I am aware that there&#039;s a lot of crime with this out there but I dunno, I can&#039;t just think all of the pedophiles are the same and they are all monsters. I feel like a lot of them are just misunderstood and have to live their whole lives feeling like trash, having to hide and being demonized by all parts of society. Maybe is it because they never found anything close to love with the people around them and when it finally comes it isn&#039;t fair to just take it away from them. Or maybe they are just confused, again, is not like they choose to feel like that.<br />
<br />
Some of these ppl can&#039;t cope with society and just like Miyako here they found out that being friends with kids just comes naturally, most of the time they won&#039;t judge you.<br />
I&#039;ve work with children myself a few years and I can say without a doubt that children for the most part don&#039;t want to destroy you cuz you are different, they will try to understand you first and after that they will either accept you or just move on, they have no need to stay and mock you.<br />
We as adults tend to judge everything and we try to destroy the things we don&#039;t like and are different.<br />
<br />
I feel like, way before we judge somebody, we must first try and remove the hate or anger we might have on our hearts, give a step back and try to understand the situation and most importantly the ppl involved in it.<br />
It&#039;s just an anime people, a work of fiction, there&#039;s no need to get angry and start throwing hate around, it&#039;s an opportunity to think about the subject and since a lot of times we grow attached to these characters this brings us a completely different point of view than any psychology or news report.

    Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! (WATATEN for the friends) is an anime released in 2019 by studio &quot;Doga Kobo&quot;.<br />
This series is the maximum expression of comedy and slice of life that you can look for in animation. Funny, relaxing, MOE and not boring at all, in a nutshell, a home cure for sadness and depression.<br />
<br />
Story: 8.5<br />
Miyako is shy, a NEET, chubby, clumsy and she has no friends. Hana, a friend of her little sister, Hinata, one day finds herself at her home and literally becomes a miracle for our protagonist in suit. Miyako literally falls in love with Hana at first sight and and that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306106">
        day marks the beginning of her change.<br />
The story is a classic Slice of life, so it does not present anything special in terms of narration. It&#039;s simple, but very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
Doga Kobo is a guarantee in animations. The design is very different from the manga, but literally better and cute. The animations are accurate, the characters&#039; faces and bodies are well proportioned and an excellent color calibration is used, perfect in this context.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
Opening and Ending present very melodic,funny and context-appropriate songs.<br />
OSTs in general are very well appreciated and enjoyable during the episode.<br />
<br />
Character: 8+<br />
WATATEN presents a wide range of characters. The main characters present very well-characterized and different personalities: Miyako, Hinata, Hana and Noa will succeed in impressing us in the same way, without leaving a character back respect to another. <br />
Excellent work also in dubbing, which manages to interpret the characters in an excellent way.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
As I said earlier, this series is a cure for sadness. The first episode was probably one of the most fun I&#039;ve ever seen. The other episodes also have a high level of entertainment, going from hilarious moments to some small tear-jerking moments like the last episode. Each character managed to get me a smile and different emotions in the various moments of the episodes and the story, although very simple, has a noticeable impact.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8.5<br />
Wataten is certainly one of the flagship series of the &quot;Doga Kobo&quot; studio. A very funny anime, relaxing and without any pretense, but that manages to keep you glued on the screen for all 24 minutes, guaranteeing you different laughs and hilarious moments.<br />
Highly recommended for lovers of this genre and of this animation studio.
