I only started watching it because people were making a fuss about how another series copied an extremely famous scene from Maria-sama ga Miteru, but I ended up watching both the first and second seasons.  (The third season wasn&#039;t out at that time.)<br />
<br />
This is now my favourite series.  But it was far from being a favourite then-- I watched it all very quickly, and I don&#039;t think this is a series that was meant to be seen like that.  I overlooked a lot the first time around and it ended up seeming

          <span style="display: none;" id="review1682">
        the characters were making baseless observations about others.  It&#039;s easy to watch those slice-of-life school comedy series quickly, for example, since you&#039;re just in for a laugh or two, but Maria-sama ga Miteru has got characterisation, believability, and complex interpersonal dynamics that should be savoured slowly.<br />
<br />
The seiyuu are great overall and generally convey characters&#039; thoughts and feelings very well.  The animation, however, could&#039;ve been better...  some parts look a bit unnatural or perhaps a bit mechanical, but I don&#039;t think it detracts very much from the series overall and I enjoyed the art style.<br />
<br />
I fell in love with the series when I rewatched it because there&#039;s so much in it.  This isn&#039;t your typical, run-of-the-mill series where you can just watch for mindless enjoyment.  It isn&#039;t something you just watch because you know there&#039;s f/f in it either.  This is possibly the best f/f series you&#039;ll ever watch-- without your usual crazy and melodramatic minor character lesbians in it, to boot.  (Note that the f/f present is largely on the subtext level, which I find makes it even more delectable.  There&#039;s canon stuff though, so it&#039;s not &amp;quot;just wishful thinking&amp;quot;.)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I am of the mind that Maria-sama ga Miteru would still be enjoyable for those who don&#039;t like f/f or aren&#039;t particularly into it.  The wonderful characterisation alone should be enough of a draw, should it be the sort of thing you look for in anime.  Let me put it this way: This series doesn&#039;t necessarily focus on f/f too much if you&#039;re inclined to see it that way.  Such is the beauty of subtext.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if it matters to you, the focus isn&#039;t on religion despite the series name and the setting (a private Catholic all girls&#039; school).  It&#039;s really just about a group of young women and what happens to them and between them... which I guess makes it fall pretty firmly into the shoujo genre. <br />
<br />
Maria-sama ga Miteru, then, is not recommended for those who only enjoy panty shots or seeing two girls somehow ending up in unrealistic, compromising situations.  (Please go watch seinen for that fanservice stuff because there&#039;s no fanservice in this at all.)  I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to people who like a lot of action either, because, well, it doesn&#039;t have much.  It&#039;s slice-of-life (probably leaning more toward drama), so if you need an overarching plot to sustain your interest, this is also not for you.  This is for those who are starved for a series with, finally, good characterisation.<br />
<br />
And lastly, there are no self-pitying and screaming adolescent boys piloting mecha, thank goodness.

    Poor quiet anime with fabulous, fabulous storytelling and characterisation. They get no love, and this is apparent for Maria-sama ga Miteru. <br />
<br />
It tells the story of girls in a Catholic school. That&#039;s all. It&#039;s them, their lives, and yet it sucks you in like nothing else could, wraps you up in their stories and makes you itching to learn about them more. <br />
<br />
There&#039;s a little controversy of sorts about the lesbian content of this anime. Honestly, it seems like all the girls are in love with one another, but that isn&#039;t the case. There&#039;s only one real lesbian in the entire story. So it&#039;s interesting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review8982">
        to see girls who actually care for one another and are insanely close other than spend their time plotting and hating on one another like other shoujo anime. <br />
<br />
I love this anime. I can&#039;t think of anything unfabulous about it other than inconsistent art and a confusing first few episodes. It will take you while to get used to the names they call one another.

    I wasn\&#039;t sure I was gonna like it at first.. I usually judge anime by watching the opening theme, and I thought it was so dreary because it was all instrumental.. After watching the first two episodes I was satisfied and decided to watch the whole thing.<br />
<br />
It brought back memories from my high school days, since I came from a private catholic all girls school, much like the one in the anime.. We didn\&#039;t have a soeur system, but there were other similarities, such as girls crushing on other girls..<br />
There were a lot of french terms used, but you didn\&#039;t really need to learn how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review469">
        to speak French to understand the story.. the only french words used in the dialogues were the titles, such as rosa gigantea en bouton, and soeur of course, and they weren\&#039;t used much after the first episodes. The episode titles are also French.<br />
<br />
There was little lesbian action going on, but it was very discreet so it didn\&#039;t really scare me too much.. The only character who was openly gay was Sei, and the rest of the cast didn\&#039;t give off any impressions that they were gay. There is a big shortage in men characters, the only male characters were Sachiko\&#039;s cousin and fiance, and Yumi\&#039;s brother.<br />
<br />
The visuals were amazing. All the characters were beautifully drawn, which is one of the reasons why I decided to watch this. All the women were beautiful, but I get the feeling that if you took out their hair and gave them identical wigs, they would almost look the same.<br />
<br />
The storyline wasn\&#039;t bad - It was mainly about Yumi\&#039;s character and how she tries her best to get along with her onee-sama, Sachiko. During the series, a few episodes are dedicated to Rei and Yoshino\&#039;s relationship, as well as Sei\&#039;s history. We also see some side stories about Sachiko and Shimako.<br />
<br />
As I\&#039;ve mentioned, most of the music were instrumental, and there was only one song with words in it, which was Rosa Canina\&#039;s rendition of \&amp;quot;Ave Maria\&amp;quot;. Still dreary, but the story does make up for the lack of better music choices. However, I do think that the classical music fits the storyline well. It is a rather serious storyline.<br />
<br />
All in all, I have to say this is one of my favorite series. I have watched many slice of life series, and this one is the best among the rest. It is definitely as must - see.

    Had my doubts about this anime from the start actually. How much fun can an anime conveying a story in a religious school actually be? Well I gave it a shot and now after having watched it through in 3 days I can truly say that it was well worth it! The series in most parts is quite serious but with the help of the characters introduced we get parts that display different personalities and emotions. After finishing the series I was left with the curiosity and need of wanting to know more about the characters. So now I will get into season 2 and

    As a rare duck around here, a soon to be 50 year old male who enjoys slice of life anime, I found Maria-sama ga Miteru to have been absolutely charming and delightful, and easily the best series I&#039;ve watched in all of 2008. The calm, serene, languid pace of the series and its setting at an all-girl&#039;s Catholic school made it easy to relax with, but it&#039;s the wealth of the show&#039;s characters, each with their own distinct and unique personality increased my overall enjoyment and is the highlight of the show. As you watch the show, you can&#039;t help becoming involved in the lives

    Story 6/10<br />
This was a slice-of-life anime with very light shoujo-ai elements.  It reminded me of Haibane Renmei in terms of how uneventful the plot really was.  Even the climactic moments weren&#039;t especially emotional or intense.  A &quot;peak&quot; in the storytelling might be a scene where Sachiko speaks sharply to Yumi and Yumi cries.  The story therefore wasn&#039;t exactly bad, as it would have been if there had been plot holes or unresolved subplots.  However, it also wasn&#039;t very engaging.  Yumi and Sachiko, the main characters, more or less got along throughout, and there were no especially troublesome characters on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15432">
        the side to cause any real conflict.<br />
<br />
Art 7/10<br />
The art is a little old-fashioned now, but the character design was quite pretty.  I wasn&#039;t especially moved by any particular image, but it&#039;s an attractive show.<br />
<br />
Sound 6/10<br />
The music works with the show.  No tracks stood out to me though as anything I would definitely want to own and listen to.  I&#039;m really into soundtracks, so that&#039;s a bit of a rarity.  I didn&#039;t HATE the music, as for instance I hate the Gilgamesh soundtracks, but it was unmemorable.  It went with the plot, which kept things always on a pretty even keel.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10<br />
The characters were decent.  Yumi was lovable and naive, Sachiko was poised but vulnerable, and the other roses and their petite soeurs were pretty individualistic.  Some even had interesting back stories.  However, everyone was likable, which is a bit uninteresting in a way.  In addition, their personalities were a little too one-dimensional.  It reminded me a bit of these other game-based harem shows, like Meine Liebe and Harukanaru, where each guy has a very shallow personality because he has to represent just a few qualities, so that the girl can pick the one she likes the best and doesn&#039;t have to wade through a multi-layered personality.  So although each character had a well-defined personality, they didn&#039;t have enough depth to really stand out.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10<br />
It wasn&#039;t painful to watch, but it wasn&#039;t all that engaging either.  Yumi, the real heroine, started out as an ordinary girl who was given an extraordinary opportunity--to be Sachiko&#039;s petite soeur.  That&#039;s a nice setup, but Yumi doesn&#039;t really vindicate herself.  Throughout the show, she remains the sweet, ordinary girl thrown amongst extraordinary people.  In a way, that&#039;s the show&#039;s point--that she was extraordinary in her own way.  However, I&#039;m more into shows where the protagonist really grows and eventually shines.  The lack of conflict and the lack of growth were tedious.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10<br />
It&#039;s hard giving this a final overall mark.  I don&#039;t want to be too harsh because I realize that this isn&#039;t a genre I especially enjoy.  I think that the show was what it intended to be, so saying that the plot wasn&#039;t fast-paced enough for me or that Yumi didn&#039;t grow enough as a character isn&#039;t entirely fair.  Still, I think that the story would have been much better with a bit more conflict and a few characters who weren&#039;t so likable.  And I would have liked to know more about Yumi&#039;s own background.

    First off, I&#039;d like to start by saying this series (all four seasons) is one of my all-time favorite anime to watch.  By the time I&#039;ve written this, I&#039;ve gone through a full viewing of this series at least 6 times, read the manga and started on a translated version of the light novels the series is based on.  If you knew me personally, all of that would probably blow your mind simply because it doesn&#039;t fit my normal viewing patterns (I tend to go for beautifully animated flashy action in mostly male-oriented stories with big plot advancements and good guy vs. bad

          <span style="display: none;" id="review341332">
        guy narratives).  To say that this series is a giant leap for me is an understatement.<br />
<br />
But I&#039;m a sucker for character-driven narrative, and while Maria-sama ga Miteru (MgM) lacks most of what I crave, what it delivers in character development more than makes up for any of that.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll review the other seasons in their respective review sections, so my comments will try to stick mainly to the story in this first season.<br />
<br />
First, I&#039;ll start off with the cons, because the list is short and I want to get to the good stuff:<br />
<br />
The animation is, to put it politely, not awesome.  It&#039;s not terrible, and the scenery is beautifully drawn in most cases, but there is a noticeable lack of fluidity in most scenes, and the series often relies on still shots and a small amount of noticeable cgi to tell the story.  None of it is obnoxious enough to make me lose interest in the story, and I feel its ultimately forgivable in a story like this one. Still, it&#039;s the reason I gave this series a 9 instead of a 10.<br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t necessarily a con, but it does make a difficult point to try to sell the series with:  there is basically no action whatsoever.  There is a background subplot involving a kendo club, but it barely plays into the story as more than a temporary plot device.  The kendo match shown in one scene is not a flashy anime kendo match, but looks like what a live viewing of a kendo match would look like from the stands, which is to say, pads and guards are worn, and there aren&#039;t any flashy moves.  Other than that, apart from some much-frowned-upon running in the school hallways, the characters mostly glide along at a snail&#039;s pace as per the Lillian Academy&#039;s rules for proper young ladies.<br />
<br />
Again, this isn&#039;t necessarily a con, but you do have to make it past the first ten minutes or so of the first episode before you can get a firm understanding of what is basically going on.  Think the first episode of Stein&#039;s;Gate, but shorter and slightly more confusing.  Fortunately, by the end of the episode, you&#039;re aware of where the story is headed and can sit back and enjoy the rest of the series as it comes to you.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it for the cons.  Seriously.  I&#039;m sure other reviewers would argue with me on that, but to be honest, all I ask of a story is to be interesting and have characters I can relate to or sympathize with, and who develop and change over time.<br />
<br />
Honestly, my first viewing of this season almost ended within the first half of the first episode.  This wasn&#039;t anywhere near my genres of choice, I hated Catholic school when I attended one as a child, and the only thing I have in common with high school girls is that my daughter is about to reach her teens. <br />
<br />
What kept me watching was the main character, Yumi.  If I had to describe her, I&#039;d say she was scientifically crafted to fill the &quot;little sister who must be protected at all costs so that her good nature is never soiled by this cruel world&quot; role, and those scientists did a bang-up job.  She is innocent (though not necessarily utterly naive), curious, famously expressive, friendly almost to a fault, and absolutely adorable without being sickeningly so.  She&#039;s flawed by a heavy, though not debilitating, insecurity around those she feels are better than her, and at times she is a bit too humble.  But she is honest and chipper and my gawd you just want to reach through the screen and hug her and tell her everything will be okay in scenes where she starts crying.<br />
<br />
As the seasons progress, you watch as Yumi&#039;s personality grows in maturity and she works to correct her flaws as she deals with setbacks and obstacles that cause her trouble.  This first season focuses mainly on Yumi&#039;s budding relationship with Sachiko, the daughter of a massively wealthy family, widely regarded as sort of a princess of the Lillian Academy, and who is - personality-wise - almost the complete opposite of Yumi.  Where Yumi is often clumsy and overly expressive, Sachiko is cool and graceful.   Where Yumi is friendly and good-natured, Sachiko usually comes off as disinterested and prone to bratty hysterics.  They come from two different worlds, and Sachiko is the embodiment of everything Yumi is insecure about.  While Yumi eventually agrees to become Sachiko&#039;s &quot;little sister&quot;, it takes Yumi the span of the first two seasons to fully accept that she is worthy of the title.<br />
<br />
When an episode isn&#039;t focused on Yumi and Sachiko, it focuses on the other sisters in the &quot;Rose families&quot; (the Lillian student council sister pairings).  These are interesting in their own rights, and give a good view into the dynamic in the relationships between the Yellow sisters (most notably the boyish-but-girly kendo star Rei and her little sister/actual cousin, the sickly Yoshino), and a peak into the basic awareness that the White sisters (the playful and cheerful older sister Sei and the somewhat aloof and reserved Shimako) have for each other.  Sei, thus far the only confirmed lesbian main character in a series that often inexplicably gets the &quot;yuri&quot; label, also gets some of her semi-tragic back story revealed to show why she&#039;s the Sei she is today.  <br />
<br />
Sei quickly became one of my three favorite characters from this series because of the relationship she has with Yumi.  Where Sachiko starts out with more of a formal &quot;big sister&quot; role with Yumi, Sei immediately became a playful older sibling, often teasing or chiding Yumi, generally doing her best to keep Yumi on her toes while at the same time often stirring jealousy in Sachiko (something Sei seems to purposefully do to keep the bond between Yumi and Sachiko growing).  And since most of Yumi&#039;s problems arise as a result of her tenuous relationship with Sachiko, Sei often steps in to dispense advice or offer an encouraging word.<br />
<br />
The older Red and Yellow Roses, Yoko and Eriko respectively, are also there.  There isn&#039;t much to say about them for this season, but that&#039;s okay.  They served minor purposes and weren&#039;t shoe-horned into the plot unnecessarily.  I can respect that choice.<br />
<br />
There are no defined antagonists in the series.  There is no &quot;that one person&quot; who is making life hell for someone else and must be brought down and defeated.  There are a few characters that come along and are portrayed initially as possible antagonists or rivals, but as the story carries on, you see the reasoning behind their actions and motives was usually to protect or help someone else.  The adversity in the series comes from each character&#039;s own personalities, and how they relate to others.  There is no outright hatred between anyone in the series, and drama usually comes from misinterpretation, insecurity, or not being able to communicate properly, whether from circumstance or lack of courage.<br />
<br />
In another series, the situations that provide challenges for Yumi and company would be seen as unnecessary melodrama lazily thrown in to try to humanize the plot.  But with MgM, the situations fit in just fine with the setting and make a certain amount of sense in their context.<br />
<br />
Also, I&#039;d like to point to the voice acting for the series, which is nothing less than superb.  Ueda Kana, especially, as the voice of Yumi, was an absolute treat.  Toyoguchi Megumi brought a delightfully pleasant cheeriness to Sei&#039;s character, and Itou Miki was elegant in her portrayal of Sachiko.  (Any time Itou said &quot;Yumi&quot; was like ASMR for me.  I don&#039;t know why.)<br />
<br />
So I absolutely recommend this series to anyone who likes a good story with a character-driven plot, actions with consequences, and natural character growth over time.  Do yourself a favor and give at least the first season a try.  It&#039;s one of those series that isn&#039;t going to be for everyone, but if you&#039;re willing to step out of your wheelhouse every once in a while, this is a good series with which to do so.

    &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; is a sweet and enjoyable shoujo. For a shoujo it&#039;s surprisingly undramatic, but this means it lacks melodrama too, so no deathbed love stories or over the top villainous girls. <br />
<br />
As yuri sorts of shoujos go, it&#039;s more realistic and less silly than &quot;Strawberry Panic&quot; but not quite the &quot;these are real girls&quot; experience of Aoi Hana. There&#039;s a good deal of silliness here, but it&#039;s presented in a natural enough way. It helps that the central character Yumi is likeable enough, and doesn&#039;t come off entirely as a Mary Jane sort, a Little Miss Perfect without any personality.<br />
<br />
I think it&#039;s ultimately

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182405">
        a nice balance. It&#039;s amusing and funny but you don&#039;t find yourself rolling your eyes at unbelievable characters and goofy melodrama. There are deep friendships and light romance but it&#039;s not sappy. A lot of the relationships are presented in a clever way, such as Yumi and Sachiko, such that you think you understand a character but in later episodes, fascinating new layers are added that build on tiny hints of their character from earlier episodes.  <br />
<br />
The only annoyance for me is that many episodes seem to focus on a specific character and story, to the neglect of everything else, with Yumi hardly showing up in some episodes. <br />
<br />
This is definitely a &quot;quiet&quot; anime, even by shoujo standards. There is not a lot of screaming and high drama, but this is actually refreshing because the story is so laid back and void of melodrama that makes you not take it seriously.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t find the art in this series to be anything special (it did get better in the second season). The music in the first season was also a disappointment, the arrangements of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (basically obligatory, given the title) might sound great to Japanese ears but as someone familiar with western arrangements of it, I have been underwhelmed. <br />
<br />
If you like well-written shoujo, especially the sort with intense friendships that border on yuri, this is definitely worth checking.

    This review covers the entire series, which consists of four seasons.  The style and quality are reasonably consistent throughout the series, so separate reviews for each season would be largely redundant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; is unique and fascinating in many ways.  It has many layers of meaning, and it lends itself well to critical analysis and repeated viewings.  This series is not likely to appeal to everybody.  It is slow-moving, emotional, and highly melodramatic at times.  It is also designed for a female demographic, so although I am sure men can enjoy it, it lacks the fan service and overt sexuality

          <span style="display: none;" id="review129721">
        that appeal to a certain subset of the male demographic.  However, anyone who enjoys coming of age stories, deep and detailed characterization, and compelling cultural commentary should consider watching this series.<br />
<br />
The multiple themes and layers of meaning appeal to me, for they encourage my analytical tendencies.  Given the nature of this series and my tendency to analyze everything, this review will devolve into lengthy critical analysis, so be warned.  However, those who read through it might find the first few episodes a little easier to follow.<br />
<br />
From the very first episode, &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; is a study of hierarchical societies.  Japanese society is well known for being hierarchical, and standard forms of hierarchy are inevitably present in school-based anime series.  The girls&#039; school here, however, has its own unique system of hierarchy, evident both in language and character behavior, so it is likely to cause its viewers, even Japanese viewers, to notice and ponder the nature of hierarchy.  In language, the most noticeable difference between this series and others is in the use of honorifics; students use the honorific -sama instead of -senpai when referring to upperclassmen.  The usage of this rather formal honorific in Japan is somewhat problematic, and it can be considered rude or patronizing when used inappropriately.  It would not ordinarily be used as the characters use it in this series.  Even the standard greeting the students use, Gokigenyou, is archaic and formal.  The student council members have grandiose titles as the Lady Roses, and most students refer to them by their titles - Rosa Chinensis, Rosa Gigantea, and Rosa Foetida - rather than their names; this usage places them in an exalted and unapproachable position.  The use of polite honorifics, archaic language, and grandiose titles serves to highlight and exaggerate the system of hierarchy.  However, not every character perfectly follows the rules, and whether or not a character or a pair of friends follows the language rules is an important point in characterization and can be a source of conflict.  Noriko, a character introduced in the second season, is quite interesting in this regard.<br />
<br />
The development of deep friendships is another major theme in this series, and it is the central driving force behind the story arcs.  These friendships are encouraged by the sœur system, a system in which an upperclassman and an underclassman declare a relationship as sisters.  (Sœur is French for sister.)  This is fundamentally a hierarchical relationship, for the older sister, the onee-sama, is expected to provide guidance to her younger sister.  The sœur relationships involving the student council are particularly important, for the younger sisters of the Lady Roses, the boutons, also have a strong role on the council.  These relationships become extremely close, and in fact can come so close to actual romance that it is easy to read a lesbian subtext into the relationships despite the fact that only one main character is overtly lesbian.  Since such close relationships cross the hierarchical boundary between underclassmen and upperclassmen, they effectively destabilize the hierarchy, creating a fascinating conflict within the narrative.  The sœur relationships also occur across class lines.  This is an elite Catholic school, so all of the students are likely to be affluent, but some are merely well off, while others are filthy rich.  The relationship between Yumi and Sachiko effectively explores such class differences, and their friendship allows each to explore the other&#039;s world in ways that would ordinarily be impossible.<br />
<br />
The march of time is another important theme, and the constant progress of time allows the characters and their relationships to develop and grow.  High school is a time of transition; people aren&#039;t there forever, and unlike some school series, &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; does not sweep time under the rug.  The episodes are mostly (but not always) in chronological order, and there are some flashbacks.  The first season sets the groundwork for a major transition to come in the second, and the fourth season similarly prepares the viewer for changes to come afterwards.  (A fifth season has so far not been produced, but the light novels continue the story beyond the fourth season.)  Yumi&#039;s growth as a character is handled well throughout the series; she starts as a wide-eyed innocent girl who lacks confidence in herself, and by the end of the fourth season, she has gone through many changes.  (To prevent spoilers, I will leave out the details.)  Even melodramatic story arcs, such as the coincidence-filled story ending the second season, help to develop the characters and to aid the passage of time.  This is one series that can get away with melodrama, for the characters are strong enough to make it through exaggerated plot lines unscathed.<br />
<br />
Though the story and characterization are the greatest strengths of this series, the art and music deserve a few words, for they contribute greatly to its unique and exotic style.  The character designs are more detailed than is typical for school anime series, and they are beautifully executed.  The backgrounds are soft and perhaps a little stylized, but also highly detailed, and they set up a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  As is usually the case in this era of limited budgets, animation is sometimes rough, and designs and quality are a little inconsistent from episode to episode, but these flaws are minor compared to the strengths of the series.  The music deviates from the usual pop conventions of anime; it is classical in style, and it perfectly fits the elegant atmosphere and culture of this elite school.  The closing theme of the third season and the opening and closing themes of the fourth season deviate from this style and instead conform to pop conventions.  While these themes aren&#039;t bad in and of themselves, they don&#039;t quite fit the atmosphere of the series.  The voice actresses are all excellent, and the voices fit the characters well.<br />
<br />
One could probably guess that, since I have taken the time to write such an extensive review and analysis, I love this series.  I certainly do, and I rank it as a strong favorite among the anime series I have seen so far, and it is a favorite even within the broad category of serialized programming - anime, TV series, radio series, and film serials.  The attention to detail, the strong characters, the beautiful setting, and the relaxed atmosphere all contribute to my enjoyment of this series.  Again, it may not appeal to everybody, but people looking for the qualities that have attracted me to it may also enjoy it, and perhaps a few will rank it among their favorites.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#039;m hoping for an eventual fifth season or group of OVAs to finish the story, but it has been a few years since the last installment, so my wish might never come true.<br />

(updated 10/14/19 for section addition)<br />
<br />
Hi! Welcome to another of Robert&#039;s Too Late Reviews! First of note, this will be dealing with pretty much the first season with some slight commentary on later seasons&#039; content. A more complete review, including all 4 seasons, is in the works. This was one of the first &#039;yuri&#039; type animes I watched, and the first fully subbed version I really leaned into. Now I&#039;m not hard to please when it comes to yuri anime, but Marimite (as it is often abbreviated) just blew my hair back! Its a safe bet that Marimite is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287869">
        going on the RTLR wall, now read on to find out how many spots this anime fills! Let&#039;s get into what makes this anime so very special. <br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
The story is a HUGE factor in this anime. It is a very firm class-S (which is to say non romantic, or at least non sexual love) so if you&#039;re expecting a kiss fest like Sakura Trick, move along. It is also very proper and while dramatic, it is not over the top so if you&#039;re expecting Strawberry Panic, move along again. What this show has, is deliberately slow pacing, slice of life stylings that ease you into the complex relationship all these girls have with each other. The very first thing that will likely trouble you story-wise is the names. They have an unusually large amount of names to call each other. Not only their actual name, they refer to each other as dear sister, and they also use their station and office, i.e. Rosa Foetida (the 3rd year Elder Lady Rose), Rosa Foetida en bouton (2nd year Lady in training) and occasionally Rosa Foetida en bouton de souer (1st year, new to the whole thing) which can really cause your head to spin until you get your girls and their respective flowers worked out. <br />
<br />
Once past that obstacle, however, you can begin leaning into the meat of the series. The first opening seasons focus on Sachiko and her developing deep relationship with her souer Yumi. As the seasons progress, we find Sachiko rightly takes a back seat as Yumi moves up to bouton and looks to find her very own souer or &#039;little sister&#039;. All three of the rose branches feature interesting dynamics in relation to the members of that branch. For example Rei and Yoshino are related, giving their relationship a bit of a different curve than everyone else. Sachiko and Yumi are paired together by fate, but develop a lasting love for each other. The problem becomes having the patience to wait out these incredibly important morsels as the series goes on. They are given often enough, in my opinion to make viewing worthwhile, but Fairy Tail/Bleach, this is NOT. Each of the smaller episodes build into the relationships that are central to the anime. <br />
<br />
One thing of note on the second season, we actually see the girls outside their sailor uniforms! That season deals with Sachiko&#039;s summer house, and the girls change clothes. Odd, but I haven&#039;t seen that much in anime save for perhaps Lucy from Fairy Tail. Most characters&#039; wardrobes are fairly static. <br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
This anime features simple, cleaner lines and less detailed art than many newer releases. I know i knocked Aoi Hana for this, but I find Marimite far less hard on the eyes than that show. But it still would have been nice to see a more detail oriented take on the characters. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
While I don&#039;t know the exact translation, I do know every word of season 4&#039;s opening theme and often walk around signing it. Drives my family up the wall. The earlier seasons featured instrumentals that were beautiful and fitting. For all seasons but the last, a little speech was given about the &#039;garden of maidens&#039; before the theme song. Kind of missed that on the 4th, but the song with lyrics made up for it for me. The character voices are so spot on I couldn&#039;t imagine anyone else doing them. Yumi, Toko and Sachiko are particularly well done. But I will admit Sachiko is my favorite anime character ever so I might be biased!<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
This is the meat of the anime here. If the characters fall flat, you have nothing. There&#039;s a character that by the end of season one I was sure was Evil Incarnate. By the end of the series though I came to see she was just a hurt little girl who needed to be loved. The characters grow, especially the main character Yumi and to a large extent Yoshino. Every character comes to some form of change or growth as the story concludes. Yes, the growth might be slow, but it&#039;s slow in real life too, and that gives the stories weight. They don&#039;t fix flaws overnight. They don&#039;t rush from plot point to plot point. They gave it a much more natural curve, one that works really well with the amount of time they took to tell the story. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10 <br />
I came off of Soul Eater to watch this. I thought I was an explosions kind of guy. I thought the most &#039;girly&#039; thing I&#039;d ever watch is Sailor Moon (and she still is a fighter!) but Marimite got me. Sachiko is regal and classy, while Yumi is young and naive. Shimako is a beauty in a kimono while her souer is a bundle of nerves. They all felt real, like people I would know, and for that I greatly enjoyed this anime.<br />
<br />
Best Girl: Sachiko by miles. Sachiko is pretty much my favorite anime character of all time. She&#039;s regal, yet has a kind heart. She&#039;s not above dressing someone down, but never in a vulgar way. She&#039;s just class personified. No one else even comes close. <br />
<br />
A parting word, however. Pizza Hut partnered with the show in the last season, and due to this there are several highly out of place product placement scenes. They aren&#039;t a deal breaker, but if you like this anime like me, every time they flash that Pizza Hut sign you likely won&#039;t be able to keep from rolling your eyes. As for the wall of madness here at RTLR, Marimite scored not one, not two but in fact SIX spots on the wall, four of the queen Sachiko, two with Yumi. What can I say? This is one of my absolute favorites of all time! If you love the idea of girls loving each other in a deep, soulful, non sexual manner, this is the show for you. These girls are more than friends, they are more even than lovers, they are *truly* sisters in every sense of the word. All thumbs up!

    FYI, I will be talking in regards to the entire series, not just the first season.<br />
<br />
Where do I even start this? Do I talk about finding this series by pure accident, as a result of confusing Shoujo and Shoujo Ai genres? Or my usual dislike of old series? Do I talk about the staples of yuri, how catholic high school is a frequent setting, and senpai-kohai relationships are almost expected? <br />
<br />
None of that really matters. I&#039;ve started the series with no expectations, over a decade after it was made, and it completely took over my attention. I found the setting to be charmingly quaint, characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review373602">
        to be alien but sincere, and story unsurprising but gripping. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really have any issues with he show, apart from one ark that felt a bit forced, and lack of proper ending. It&#039;s just so delightfully weird and captivating, I absolutely recommend that you check it out and make your own conclusions.

     I began Maria-sama ga Miteru with only Strawberry Panic! as my previous yuri experience. <br />
<br />
  Compared to Strawberry Panic!, the characters are better fleshed out, there is no pandering, and it isn&#039;t a cheesy melodrama. But I found myself preferring Strawberry Panic!, an anime I did not especially love.  I was so confused by this, I had to make a review to search for a reason why.<br />
<br />
 The characters are the strongest point of the show, followed by the plot. Both feel especially real, and there is bound to be a character or two you like. For me, that was Yoshino, a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review38791">
        sickly and misunderstood girl who struggles to overcome perceptions that she is a gentle flower, and Rosa Gigantea Sei, the most extroverted of the characters, who I thought had the most character development. <br />
<br />
  I might honestly call the art the low point of the series, and even then it is merely average. The uniforms are cute, but I was a little put off by the art and couldn&#039;t enjoy it as much as I otherwise could have. No obligatory blue hair, which deserves some sort of praise. <br />
<br />
  Really, that touches upon another issue; Maria-sama ga Miteru&#039;s greatest praise is not what it does, but it doesn&#039;t do. It doesn&#039;t pander. It isn&#039;t a trashy yuri, it doesn&#039;t rely on cheap misunderstandings to generate drama, or force love triangles. (Looking at you, Strawberry Panic!..) You will even like the characters.<br />
<br />
  However, while MariMite isn&#039;t doing those things, it isn&#039;t doing much else, either. The show generates relaxation and warm fuzzies, but it isn&#039;t profoundly moving. It may have been unfair to expect a strong reaction to be elicited from something that just portrays a relatively problem-free life, but other slice-of-life manages to create more attachment to the series, while I am not sure was a lasting impression here. <br />
<br />
 I fully intend to watch the next seasons, but that is out the show will grow on me and respect for the effort put into MariMite and the loyalty its fanbase has for it, rather than anticipation generated by watching the first season. <br />
<br />
 It raises questions about what should be expected from anime of different genres, and if it is wrong to look for more. I&#039;d welcome feedback from folks who get considerable enjoyment from MariMite or similar shows.

    Review free of spoilers.<br />
<br />
The daily life of the students of Lilian Girls&#039; Academy. That&#039;s about all this show is about, and yet it absorbs you into its world and doesn&#039;t let you go, but don&#039;t be fooled, even though it&#039;s addicting, it is still slow paced and very dramatic, if you rush things you might get bored. Try watching only a few episodes a day, that way it&#039;ll maintain your interest and you won&#039;t get tired of it. Savor it slowly.<br />
Every episode you learn something new about one of the characters, even if it&#039;s only an supporting character that only appears in a couple of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review209351">
        episodes, you still get to know everything about them, how they are involved with each other and the situation they are at. You get to like all the characters.<br />
Just like in real life, Maria-sama ga Miteru has sad, happy, dramatic and fun moments. It deals with the relationship of the girls, how they solve their hardships with the help of their friends, and how they get over past problems. <br />
At first their personalities might seem shallow and cliché, but after a few episodes you start to understand the reason they are that way and how they change because of the ones surrounding them.<br />
Creating so many characters with original and likable personalities and the way they interact with each other is the strong point of this show. Even if you aren&#039;t a fan of yuri I would still recommend, as lesbian romance isn&#039;t the focus of the story (only 2 or 3 actual lesbians in the 1st season) what you get is sister-like relationships.<br />
After saying all I could about the story and the characters without spoiling anything, I shall now talk about the sound in the anime, and sadly, background music is forgettable (I really don&#039;t remember it lol) voice actors couldn&#039;t fit better, perfect for their characters. Opening and ending songs are very fitting and enjoyable in my point of view.<br />
And now, for the art, well, I love it. The main point of the story is its characters, so what matters is them. Basically hair and eyes is what makes the difference in between any and every anime character. In Maria-sama ga Miteru, I loved the shoujo-ish art (especially the eyes). Animation was sometimes robotic, but I don&#039;t pay much attention to those details because the anime isn&#039;t action based so animation isn&#039;t all that important.<br />
The background is crappy but well, I spent more time reading than looking at the art so it really didn&#039;t bother me (those who watch with subs will understand).<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected and ended up caring for every character in my own way. Truly a masterpiece. One of those that creates its own world and invites you in, so that you can enjoy happy moments or feel depressed with sad parts as if you were there. It&#039;s not everyday you pass through such a beautiful and deep story like Maria-sama ga Miteru.<br />
There are those who hate romance. Those who hate drama. Those who love action (shounen). Those who don&#039;t endure melodramatic stories.<br />
If you are one of &quot;those&quot; you probably won&#039;t be able to enjoy like I did this anime, and so I can&#039;t recommend it for you, one of those.<br />
But if you like drama and slow-paced animes, don&#039;t brush this one aside because it is worth all your time for all 4 seasons.<br />
I definitively recommend Maria-sama ga Miteru.

    I am a proud shoujo-ai lover...And as I was searching for anime of this genre to watch, I found &quot;Maria-sama ga miteru&quot;<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know how to start or what to say (its kinda late so that&#039;s not really helping...xD).<br />
I am going to be straightforward with my thoughts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maria-sama ga miteru, has a simple main story, that goes in much depth. That is one of the things I admire about this anime. Although it could have been like the many slice-of-life, school comedies, it covered many issues. It doesn&#039;t only talk deeply about love...It talks about religion, friendship, depression, trust, growing up and soooo many other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217802">
        things. It gets very emotional...To me, what this anime has done with the story is unbelievable. I am truly amazed by the depth. It gets in general the needed and even more development which I appreciate a lot. So, the fact that it covers many themes etc made me admire it. <br />
<br />
-Story- 10/10<br />
<br />
As for the art...<br />
That was the main &quot;turn off&quot; before watching it. I was for so long avoiding watching this anime, because I found the artstyle really bad. And I am not proud of that, as one of my favorite anime ever has a very old artstyle as well...Months after finding this anime and &quot;rejecting&quot; it (xD), I watched a cute video with the relationship between two character and well...THAT&#039;S SHOUJO-AI FOR YOU - I decided to watch it! After having watched half of the first season, I actually started liking the artstyle. THE IRONY ;-;. -Well, before you think I am telling you the story of my life, emmm...what did I want to say?....dammit...I should really go to sleep... OH WELL, the thing is, I feel like even if the artstyle doesn&#039;t seem appealing to you at the beginning, you will probably appreciate it a lot more as you move on with the series. And right now, I actually am a fan of this artstyle and I do love it! (Although maybe that&#039;s just my general love for the series...). I did find some differences in the artstyle as the series moved on, but they were minor and in general they didn&#039;t bother me.<br />
<br />
-Art- 7/10<br />
<br />
<br />
The music was really smooth and definitely fitting the plot. It was calm but suspensfull and more &quot;out-going&quot; when needed. In general, Maria-sama ga miteru had a very nice soundtrack. <br />
<br />
-Soundtrack- 8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
THE CHARACTERS<br />
emmmmm...I LOVED THEM. ALL OF THEM. -except from that stupid Touko, she can be hit by a car for all I care- BUT...I loved mostly all of them. To be honest, since I just finished the second season and I still have two more to go, maybe I will have a different opinion about some of those characters, but since right now I am mainly talking about the first (and second) season, the characters are amazing. They are all unique, some more fun, others more loving and caring etc etc. If you watch the series you will probably love Sei the most. That is my case. Sei is one of the most strong I would say and developed characters. At the beginning we see her being simply being funloving, out-going and troublesome in a cool way, but later on...OH MAN...THE DEVELOPMENT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. THERE IS SO MUCH DEPTH ITS HARD TO EVEN...she is gay btw xD. This anime is a shoujo-ai, as I previously said, but to be completely honest, the shoujo-ai in the relationships is mild. Some of the girls are said to have a boyfriend and between others you will be confused because you won&#039;t really know if this between them is friendship or love. The characters are definitely very close to each other but in general this is the only thing I would have prefered to maybe be more clear. Sei is definitely gay though xD. Wait - is that considered<br />
a spoiler?...Nuhhhh, I would say its more like a statement xD. Well, each character gets its own development which is very nice because we see the inside of almost every and each character, and similarly, we get very good development between the different relationship that are formed throughout the story. By the way, there are a lot of ships, so be ready ;)!<br />
<br />
-Characters- 10/10<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I enjoyed this series very much, and came very close to the characters. It was definitely worth it. It is if not the best - one of the best shoujo-ai out there, and I would recommend it not only to shoujo-ai fans. I recommend anyone to watch it. Cause its not simply girl x girl romance. As I said, it covered many different areas. It is deep (I have already said that like 1000 times...) and a great and precious anime to spend your time on. <br />
<br />
-Enjoyment- 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 10/10<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
Character - 10/10<br />
Enjoyment - 9/10<br />
---------------------<br />
Overall - 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a GREAT anime...WATCH IT.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Maria-sama ga Miteru, or lovingly known by its fans as MariMite, is one of the cornerstones of the yuri genre and one of the most well-known.<br />
It takes place at Lillian Academy, a school for &#039;young maidens&#039; where they use a unique apprenticeship system.  An older student will take an underclassman under their wing and make them their little sister, and they learn about life in the school with their big sister.  And so you have MariMite...<br />
<br />
STORY:  8<br />
Judging from the above description, it doesn&#039;t sound terribly exciting, does it?  The story is all about the girls interacting with each other, problems between

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11308">
        sisters, and various school events.  Sometimes an odd twist will occur to explain things in their current state, but what was previously stated sums it up.<br />
Now normally, this would garner a nigh-average score, but it&#039;s *immensely* boosted by another score:  Character.  More on that in the corresponding section.<br />
<br />
ART:  7<br />
Nothing terribly special about MariMite&#039;s art in general, although in no way would I ever call it bad.  Some backgrounds are kinda blah, and some convey the mood perfectly, such as well-times closeups of the Virgin Mary statue.<br />
Character art is lovely, and with exception of Yumi, there&#039;s no odd facial expressions or unrealistic actions (like extradimensional hammers, super chibi-mode, or nosebleeds).  Emotions are clearly shown upon their respective character&#039;s faces, whether it be Sachiko&#039;s stern glare, or Shimako&#039;s beautiful, sad grey eyes.<br />
Many school romance animes tend to go overboard with sakura leaves and flower petals randomly flying around in the wind, and &amp;quot;symbolic&amp;quot; crap like that.  MariMite thankfully keeps this to a realistic minimum and actually give them symbolism.  I thought I would give the animation props for that.<br />
<br />
SOUND:  7<br />
The soundtrack is comprised of lots of classical type music, with many soothing pieces that fit quite well for an elite girl&#039;s academy.  Nothing I would be foaming at the mouth over, but it definitely kept the mood like the sound is supposed to.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:  10<br />
Here is the meat and potatoes of the MariMite series:  Strong characterization.<br />
There is no &#039;stereotype&#039; character in MariMite, no set tsunderes, no set genderbenders, none of that crap.  The main characters run through the whole gauntlet of emotions during their trials and tribulations at Lillian Girls Academy.  Who you think might be the good, well-behaved girl one episode, will show selfishness the next.  Who you dislike and revile one episode, will expose her weakness in the next.  Even the lesser characters will show their true colors every once in awhile.<br />
The voice acting is excellent as well, especially Sachiko and Yumi.  A lot of times, there will need to be a truly dramatic moment to bring out the best in MariMite&#039;s VAs<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT:  10 (Personal Opinion)<br />
I freakin&#039; love MariMite, even though at first I didn&#039;t care for it (see below).  I&#039;m attached to the characters, and wish to see how the rest of their school life treats them.  There are minor quibbles that I should mention however:<br />
<br />
--The first episode is particularly brutal hurdle to new viewers, due to the massive amounts of Lillian terminology and culture being tossed around, while at the same time, you&#039;re trying to learn about the characters.  Ironically, it&#039;s almost reminiscent to a first day of school.<br />
Luckily, by episode 2 or 3, it all sinks in, and the show becomes enjoyable.<br />
<br />
--Drama drama drama.  The most humor in this series comes from the next episode previews, or Yumi&#039;s reaction to random glomps.  Personally, I love tension-filled quasi-lesbian drama, but if you seek kneeslappers and chuckles, I suggest looking elsewhere young padawan.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
All in all, MariMite is a solid series that is still continuing on its 4th season as of this review.  Drama and strong, typecast-free characters are what makes this series a worthwhile watch if you are a fan of yuri, or interested in yuri.

    So what is there to say about this fun , peacfull yet in a way kinda strange anime. Strange not because its Shoujo ai or anything like that but strange because it makes that funny lovely imagination goes wild. <br />
<br />
The story was one of the things that really grabbed me and wanted to test out to see how it was to watch. It has its typical stages one might say but the anime is great in the way it tells the story between the different characters in a perfect stable way. It doesnt jump around it just stays the way it is explaining things that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review233393">
        you might have wondered about in the beginning. <br />
<br />
I like the pure music that this anime is created around. It fits it to a teeth and you just want to relax as you listen to it while you still follow the story. <br />
<br />
Yumi is who i would consider the main character eventhough this site has many as the main of this anime. But when you have watched the entire anime you kinda will feel the same that she is the true Mc it just isnt always clear. She does have her annoying sides might be in the beginning but she is also one i think is more loveable as the story progress. Sachiko Ogasawara the perfect and lonely untouchable flower is one of those that might confuse you to no ends as her relationship with Yumi feels unclear but as you will learn with every character in this anime there is always something that we cant see.The I will be honest to say that if i would be summing up the main cast i would probably spend to much time on them but i do like how they all belong to the anime in their own ways and that they are as unique as any flower. <br />
<br />
Honestly this is one of those anime that is just great to put on and watch like nothing else goes around you. I have enjoyed basically everything about it i could say that the times big dramas are annoying for me but that i think is just me and i also think that is what make this anime even greater for some. <br />
<br />
Overall its one of those great anime that you dont have to rush things with. It keeps its pace and it keeps its way through the entire season giving small hints or explanations as they go on.  In its own genre i think this is one of the best there is when it comes to Shoujo Ai. Im a guy so i might not be right here but i feel the purity and love that comes from this anime could never have been produced with a normal girl and guy relationship.

    This is the first anime i watched on dvd, im not much of a fan, watched 1 episode in animax and i thought i have to watch the whole anime. The story line some thought is not as real as it should be but for people i know and im also included, this happens naturally. As Yumi the main character didnt expect to be close to the person she admires, but with unexpected twists and turns and a whole lot of blackmailing, ended up being the little sister of Sachiko the most admired person in Lilian High School. Having a relationship with someone that you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2628">
        usually looked from far away is too much for Yumi but she tried her best and ended up having fun with it. This anime is worth watching especially the other seasons and you will see that life is as simple and as complicated like this anime

    I, like many people, judge an anime buy opening sequence.  In this one, I found the opening animation drab and boring but the music was nice.  That&#039;s probably the reason I was inclined to stick around for the next few episodes.  <br />
<br />
The story was interesting.  It was able to hold my interest without high intensity action scenes or whinny tween main characters.  I did find in certain episodes that were a little slower, there seemed to be sort of &amp;quot;forced conflict&amp;quot;.  Though there was no pressing matter to attend to, it was as if the characters were searching for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review4889">
        something that was problematic.  For example, at one point when Sachiko and Yumi are with each other, Sachiko walks off screen for a moment and Yumi seem to panic for no apparent reason.  (She didn&#039;t go anywhere!  Calm down!)  <br />
<br />
The art, while not the style I was used to, was well done.  It&#039;s easy to get used to the slightly modified style and eventually you&#039;ll grow to like it.<br />
<br />
Each character has her own distinct personality and back story.  Overall, Maria-sama ga Miteru is a very soothing anime and serves as a breath of fresh air in the clutter of overdone story-lines and character designs.

I thought the first season was good but wasn’t entirely impressed by it. Luckily, the second season (my favorite) blew me away and I can now safely say that this show is definitely worth a watch. The first series is somewhat slower and quieter than the rest, but it is a nice change of pace from “typical” anime. Don’t let the strange French titles scare you off, it is confusing at first, but it gets easier to understand with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review89663">
        each episode.<br />
<br />
The characterization is excellent and each character has their own unique personality. You won’t be annoyed about any stereotypical characters in this show because there aren’t any! You will grow to like all of the characters presented because they are just so well fleshed out. Well…most of them are fleshed out. I actually don’t feel like two of the original Roses got much development, but since they weren’t the focus it didn’t bother me all that much. Also, there may be one or two character you might not like...(Kanako and Touko perhaps...)<br />
<br />
I loved the art in the first two series, but unfortunately they change it in the third series (which is an OVA, confusingly) which I really didn’t like. I thought they looked much more elegant and unique with the original art style. The openings and closings have some weird art sometimes too, making some of the characters look rather bizarre and/or mannish. Some episodes have poorer animation than others, too.<br />
<br />
The story is all about the characters, which is my favorite kind of story. If you enjoy character dramas, you will definitely enjoy this show. The music for the show was fitting; though I personally don’t think much of it (it’s all very classical and subdued type music). Unfortunately, because this show is shoujo it does not get the love it truly deserves, whereas tripe like Clannad is praised from on high…for some reason. I really hate the anime fandom sometimes…<br />
<br />

    I was a bit unsure about to watch this or not, since it is a shoujo, but I found out that it&#039;s okay for guys to watch too. It&#039;s not typical shoujo either.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
A lot of girls in a religious school, and their relationships. This could have resulted in something mediocre, but I think that it was excellently executed in Maria-sama. Many episodes were single standing, telling about the past or the present of the girl, and when there were follow-up episodes, I just had to watch on. Great story, almost bordering to slice of life, but it&#039;s a bit too dramatic to be considered that.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review2777">
        I also liked the Yamayurikai (kind of student council), which was quite unique.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
This is maybe the shows weakest point (at least in my eyes), not that it affected me too much. There&#039;s mostly boring colours, and the animation don&#039;t seem too detailed. Character designs were good though<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Background music consisted mostly of classical, a bit too classical for me, but it worked well. It fit well into the general mood of this anime. Neither opening or ending themes were that good either. But the voice actors were great.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
This is a very character-driven anime, so thankfully the characters were good, and the relationships were interesting. I liked all of them, but there could have been a bit more focus on Sachiko and Yumi, which were my favourites. But the support characters were good as well, so the result turned out great. The relationship between Sachiko and Yumi is the most important, and they are also the most interesting (and funny)<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Yeah, well, I loved this series. Something abut it all made me love it. I got pulled into the story and the relationships, and enjoyed every episode. Since it&#039;s aimed for girls, there wasn&#039;t any fanservice or moe-characters, which I found refreshing.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
A truly great anime. Felt very refreshing, with great story and characters. A recommended watch (unless you&#039;re only into action).<br />
<br />
<br />
9 / 10
