    As a viewer of the Pokémon series from when they started, I would say that I enjoyed it as much as I did 14 years ago. As an old Pokémon fan I am I bought Pokémon X on release date and have enjoyed every second of it. Now the anime started, I saw a lot of elements coming alive from the game. <br />
As I saw the trailer of the anime, I didn&#039;t expect much of it. I found that Satoshi or Ash changed his looks way to much. It looked like the characters came from a pot of gold on the end of a rainbow.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117413">
        How do I put it.. They looked really gay. But I as an old Pokémon fan and enjoyer of the games, decided to watch the anime anyway. Against all my expectations, it was as much fun as how it was back when I was a child. The bond between Pikachu and Satoshi is as big as ever and the new Pokémon that came to life had as much fantasy and creativity in them as back then. I think they put the new element, Mega Evolution, on a good spot and it didn&#039;t get weird or confusing.<br />
There are only 2 episodes out yet, but I expect this to be an great and enjoyable anime for old Pokémon viewers and newer ones. This is gonna be a great adventure in the Kalos region! A must watch, for every Pokémon fan alike.

    **Updated 1/11/15 with all episodes seen. **<br />
<br />
Pokemon XY turned out to be a really worthy entry for Pokemon fans, old or new to sit down, relax and enjoy. <br />
<br />
STORY: 5/10 Mediocre<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t expect much story from Pokemon, for it is still a show that is primarily directed towards kids. You will still see the power of friendship, teamwork, trust and love swirling around every episode, so the basic formula did not change from the old Pokemon series. <br />
<br />
In Pokemon XY we follow Ash in his endeavor to beat all eight gyms to challenge the Kalos league, Serena in her conquest to obtain three princess keys by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review131471">
        winning the Pokemon Showcases in order to be granted the right to challenge for the Kalos Queen title, Clemont in his journey to learn more about the world and broaden his knowledge as a gym leader, and finally Bonnie, generally serving as the cheerleader of the party. <br />
<br />
The pacing is pretty uneven throughout the show, with Ash challenging the gyms at a crawling pace in the first half of the series, then him sweeping a number of them in the latter half. We see our human as well as Pokemon protagonists grow throughout the series, which is pretty satisfying. <br />
<br />
ART: 10/10 Outstanding<br />
<br />
Indeed, the art and animation of Pokemon XY is beautiful, that I was left dumbfounded and jaw dropped at the sight of the first episode. Granted, some characters look weird (for example Grant the Rock gym leader has hair resembling a crystallite), but most of the Pokemon designs in this generation could well be my very favourite, look at Scatterbug! It looked dull and boring in the official art, but in the anime itself it is one heck of an adorable creature. Look at Vivillion! It was majestic, almost unrivaled in its beauty. <br />
<br />
I always loved looking at animated Pokemon Battles, they are exciting, and on top of that they looked gorgeous in this latest series. Heck, even the usual Team Rocket motto looked gorgeous! The Pokemon Showcases are truly a spectacle to watch. <br />
<br />
I have nothing much but praise to the animation team, well done. This section alone makes Pokemon XY worth watching. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10 Very Good<br />
<br />
You really can&#039;t go wrong with this part when it comes to Pokemon, as most of the voice cast are recurring from the previous generations, and the new voice actors did a good job voicing the new characters. The background music is often a delight to listen to as it is often the same song that plays in the game, which is sheer awesome.<br />
<br />
For the OP and ED, my personal favorite are V (Volt) and DoriDori respectively, and they are often used as inserted songs throughout the series, the former often plays during Ash&#039;s gym battles, while the other during Serena&#039;s performance. <br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 7/10 Good<br />
<br />
The old characters who made their return in this series did not change much, Ash is still brave and cares for his Pokemon as much as he did before, and is still a bit of an idiot at times. The Team Rocket Trio is still as cunning and &#039;evil&#039; as ever and you can always expect them to blast off every episode they are featured in.<br />
<br />
So the highlight should be the new companions that joined Ash on his journey. Serena is the childhood friend of Ash and the supposed crush of his in the series, she is also the cook of the group. Then, we need someone knowledgeable to provide us with all the info, and enter Clement, the gym leader of Lumiose City who will also humor us with his wide array of inventions, which will always blow up. Tagging along would be the imouto of Clement,  Bonnie, who is the &quot;awww cute&quot; girl and she cares for Pokemon, a lot, well she&#039;s good for providing the needed cheerleading when Ash was battling. <br />
<br />
In Pokemon, the centre of attention is not always to human characters, but the Pokemon themselves as well. Utilizing the Pokemon natures well, we get to see the many personalities of the Pokemon. Using Serena&#039;s as an example, her Fennekin is a Careful one, always cautious when stepping out as she&#039;s not one who likes to get dirty; Pancham is an Impish one, sometimes doing naughty things like stealing Ash&#039;s hat; Eevee... ah my personal favorite, is definitely a Timid one, so shy that she can cower and hide somewhere when a stranger approaches her. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 Good<br />
<br />
Pokemon XY will be a decent show to kill some time weekly, it is, without a doubt, eye candy, and for a Pokemon fan like myself, it can provide good and relaxing entertainment in a weekly basis. <br />
<br />
The story did not end here, Ash hasn&#039;t won all the gyms, and Serena hasn&#039;t won all her princess keys. The 2nd season, XY&amp;Z, judging from the trailer at the end of the show, promises more Mega Evolutions, more legendaries, and Team Flare will finally make their screen debut.<br />
<br />
Saying this again, the graphics alone make Pokemon XY really worth it. <br />

    Pokémon the Series: XY&amp;Z Review (CONTAINS SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
It&#039;s not every day, I get to write a Pokemon review. It&#039;s always bittersweet, having a new generation of Pokemon come to an end. In the games department, X and Y was absolutely revolutionary for the Pokemon franchise. As for the anime, well... we just came off of the Black and White anime, which is widely considered to be the worst of the Pokemon anime. So X and Y had a lot of fixing to do? Does it succeed? Well, let&#039;s talk about that.<br />
<br />
First off, I don&#039;t know how they keep doing it, but the Pokemon anime just keeps

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239963">
        getting better and better, in terms of animation. That&#039;s undeniable. Right from the get go, the new art palette (teehee) is a huge step up from the already amazing looking Black and White (which is the only amazing thing about that season). Not only to the colors look improved, but Ash looks significantly older in this series. Of course he&#039;s still in 10 year old limbo, but we can at least pretend that he&#039;s aged over time, with this one. I get that they want to have a 10 year old protagonist so that the majority of the Pokemon anime audience can have a character that they can relate to, but I think it&#039;d be even more impactful to have that protagonist grow up, along with its audience. While he may not be doing that in the age department, he definitely did that in the personality department.<br />
<br />
So in Black and White, Ash had completely lost and and all knowledge and skill he ever had, throughout the entirety of Diamond and Pearl. And considering D&amp;P has an INCREDIBLY smart and deep Ash in it, Black and White back peddled like nobody&#039;s business! So when X and Y roles around and introduces this new, more confident Ash, I was really impressed. This Ash is more confident, courageous, intelligent, and acts as a mentor to his traveling companions. Usually that honor belongs to the older male traveling companion. But Ash does a really good job with this role, while also continuing to have growth and struggles of his own. It&#039;s by far the best Ash Ketchum in the Pokemon anime, and I&#039;m REALLY sad that the small bits of the Sun and Moon anime that I&#039;ve seen so far seem to completely erase that personality and rewrite Ash from the ground up, once again. But I guess we&#039;ll just have to wait and see if that&#039;s entirely true.<br />
<br />
Speaking of starting from the ground up, like always, Ash has an entirely new traveling party in this new region. And for the first time since the Hoenn generation, Ash is traveling in a party of FOUR this time, as opposed to three. First off, we have the female playable character in X and Y, Serena. Right from the beginning, Serena is a very interesting character. When we get to see her and personal life, she seems very atypical, compared to all the other female traveling companions that Ash has had, in the past. First off, she doesn&#039;t start off with any Pokemon, or even with any plans to get one and go on a journey. She&#039;s just a girl living at home, who doesn&#039;t seem to be really involved in anything related to Pokemon. But the reason she has for going on a journey is actually REALLY interesting. You immediately become interested in her story and hope to see it go somewhere that Pokemon has never really gone, before. Unfortunately, this big suspenseful journey gets wrapped up pretty quickly and anticlimactically. But that doesn&#039;t stop Serena from being an absolute joy to have on screen.<br />
<br />
Serena reminds me a lot of Dawn, in which she&#039;s a character that continuously grows in both victory and failure. She has her victories like every main character always gets. But it&#039;s not always like that. A lot of her victories involve overcoming obstacles such as people and past events that tell her she&#039;s not good enough. And I&#039;m not just talking about jerkish rivals. I&#039;m talking about parents who paved a predetermined path for her. I&#039;m talking about legends in the industry of her dreams that tell her she has no hope of succeeding, simply because the great classics that came before her already set the bar and nobody will ever be able to top it, simply because it isn&#039;t a classic. Not only that, she has a lot of times where she DOES fail and it breaks her up. Seeing her in those darker states is one of the more emotional things to witness in the Pokemon series. But what&#039;s even more powerful is seeing her recovery from those moments.<br />
<br />
Serena goes through more growth and development in her journey than Ash was able to do in the first THREE generations of Pokemon! They didn&#039;t treat Serena like a side character. They made her important and an equal to Ash in the story. And not only does she look up to him for inspiration and admire him more than any other traveling companion in the past, but Ash also looks up to her, as well. We&#039;re always gonna have a soft spot in our hearts for Misty and I absolutely loved Dawn as a character in Diamond and Pearl. But I can easily say that Serena is the BEST female protagonist in the Pokemon anime&#039;s history!<br />
<br />
And I&#039;m happy to say that the great characters don&#039;t stop there! Ash&#039;s next traveling companion is the 5th gym leader in X and Y, Clemont. Who I constantly refer to as Clementine, because reasons. My favorite character in the Pokemon anime has always been Brock. He&#039;s both incredibly hilarious and he&#039;s also been such a great role model to the other members of the group. But throughout all the time we spent with Brock over the years, he never had a journey of growth in the anime. At least not one that was very prominent. The reason for that is because he didn&#039;t really ever need one. Being a well seasoned gym leader, he was incredibly smart and focused more on helping others, due to him kinda already having his life plan all figured out. But as soon as he discovered a desire to start something new, he went and did it, alone. So we never saw any of the struggles he may have had. <br />
<br />
So now we switch over to Clemont, who is a gym leader just like Brock and also INCREDIBLY intelligent. But he isn&#039;t nearly as confident in where his life is headed and finds the desire to go on a journey to develop his skills and expand his horizons. And he gets that ambition from meeting Ash. Being a gym leader makes Ash look up to him, but Clemont returns those exact feelings in this random trainer that he just met. So they end up traveling together with a promise to help one another in improving themselves. Just like Serena, this made Clemont a lot more enjoyable to watch, since we get to see him grow, as opposed to just being the voice of reason. And while I still say Brock will always be my favorite, I can say that Clemont is the BEST male traveling companion that Ash has ever had. While his journey isn&#039;t as grand as Serena&#039;s, we still see a lot of growth that we&#039;ve never seen in any male traveling companion before him. <br />
<br />
Something I&#039;m really glad about is that he wasn&#039;t as super nerdy as I initially thought he was gonna be. Ya, he&#039;s a sciencey inventor type of guy, but he&#039;s not really nerdy about it. The only thing I really didn&#039;t like is that his new inventions that got introduced almost every episode ALWAYS came with an overly detailed explanation on what they did and how they worked. And they were always followed up with Ash saying &quot;WOW! SCIENCE IS SO AMAZING!&quot; It was like having 2 Team Rocket mottos in every episode, and it just took up too much time, on top of it being super cheesy and not nearly as cool as the Team Rocket motto. But still, he has a ton of kick butt, awesome moments that make him seem really cool and not at all like your typical nerd trope. I also like how he&#039;s the first of Ash&#039;s traveling companions to actually get tired from all that walking and running around that they always do. I mean seriously! Ash and company have traveled the world by foot for over 20 years, and we JUST NOW get a character whose like &quot;I&#039;m too old for this!&quot; Granted, it&#039;s probably cuz he&#039;s always lugging around a giant metal backpack, but still. It was a funny addition to his character.<br />
<br />
Now like I said, this generation of the anime actually had FOUR traveling companions! The final member of Ash&#039;s group is Clemont&#039;s younger sister, Bonnie. Right off the bat, you&#039;re reminded of Max from the Hoenn anime. I actually like Max a lot more than most people do. I found him more interesting than May and he&#039;s also the main focus of my favorite episode in the entire Pokemon anime, &quot;Do I Hear A Ralts?&quot;. So I was actually really excited to see another younger, non-trainer character join Ash&#039;s group. Bonnie is both absolutely hilarious and extremely adorable. At first, she does seem a bit much, with how she thinks every single Pokemon is &quot;SOOOO CUUUUTE!&quot;. But she plays off of Clemont really well and has a lot of cute moments, herself. One thing she does is that she tends to go to every attractive girl she sees and asks them to &quot;Take care of&quot; her brother. Which then results in Clemont pulling her away, super embarrassed. Obviously this is just a re-skin of the Brock gag that we all know and some of us love. While it&#039;s not as funny as watching Brock&#039;s ear getting ripped off or getting poisoned to death but miraculously recovering from it, it&#039;s still funny to see.<br />
<br />
Bonnie actually plays a really important role in the anime, despite not being a trainer and thus not really being able to start a journey of her own, yet. She has a lot of episodes centered around her that range from cute to funny to &quot;OH MY GOD IT&#039;S SO SAD!!!!! ESPURR WHY!?!?!?!?!?&quot; She gets even more important in the show&#039;s second half, known as XY&amp;Z. First off, as if the jump from Black and White to X and Y wasn&#039;t impress enough, in terms of animation, the animation jump from XY to XY&amp;Z is EVEN MORE mindblowingly amazing! Honestly, the episodes in XY&amp;Z look up to par with the Pokemon MOVIES! And I don&#039;t mean the old ones, I mean the ones getting released right now! Seriously, this show is stinkin gorgeous and deserves respect for not only seeing how far the Pokemon anime has come, but also for simply being one of the best looking anime I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
But ya. Back to Bonnie. In XY&amp;Z, we find a mysterious, unknown Pokemon. Bonnie takes it upon herself to take care of it and give it the name &quot;Squishy&quot;. Now Squishy actually plays a very important role in the show&#039;s story. But honestly, having a name like Squishy makes it VERY hard for me to take a lot of those intense moments at the end of the show very seriously. Regardless, Bonnie is thankfully never pushed to the side or treated too much as a mascot character. She plays a very important role and she&#039;s an absolute joy to watch. All 4 of the main human characters play off of each other so well. I can easily say that this is my favorite group of human characters in any Pokemon anime generation. They were all fantastic and I very much enjoyed going on a journey with each and every one of them.<br />
<br />
And of course, Team Rocket. Unfortunately, they don&#039;t get NEARLY as much screen time and emotional episodes all to themselves as they did in Diamond and Pearl, but they still had a ton of great moments and were 1000 times better than they were in Black and White. As for the Pokemon characters... again, Diamond and Pearl has this show beat. Those of you who have seen Diamond and Pearl will probably understand and agree with me when saying that they had the BEST Pokemon characters in the history of the show. X and Y had some Pokemon that stood out more than others, but Diamond and Pearl made EVERY Pokemon important and likable. This show did not. Probably the most prominent one is Ash&#039;s Greninja. They tried REALLY hard to make Greninja the next Charizard. They REALLY wanted you to like this Pokemon. Did they succeed? Well... sort of? Greninja actually does a lot to make Ash more likable, as weird as that sounds. It&#039;s sorta hard to explain it all briefly, but you&#039;ll understand when you see the show for yourself, how Greninja makes Ash more involved in battles, as well as more deep of a character.<br />
<br />
The music is classic Pokemon style. It&#039;s good, but nothing super memorable. The 3 opening theme songs are all great, however. The 1st one is just a remix of the original theme song that we all know and love, so that may turn some people on, right off the bat. The other 2 are really good and also really different, compared to the theme the past couple of openings seemed to have. I just REALLY wish they made the english openings longer than 30 seconds. I mean, come on! Kids aren&#039;t THAT impatient! Especially at 8:00 in the morning. I promise you! Now, like every generation of Pokemon, there&#039;s a butt load of cash cow movies, trailing behind it. X and Y has 3 movies attached to it, which I&#039;ll go over very briefly. The Diancie movie has an ending that&#039;ll probably scare some kids who are new to Pokemon. But if you&#039;ve seen the first Pokemon movie, you know EXACTLY how the &quot;BIG PROBLEM&quot; at the end of this movie is going to get resolved. All in all, not worth the watch. The second movie stars Hoopa, who is one of the most annoying talking legendaries in Pokemon movie history. Not nearly as bad as Keldeo, thankfully. But still incredibly annoying to where I&#039;ll tell you to avoid this movie, simply because Hoopa is in it. <br />
<br />
The last movie stars both Volcanion and Magearna, and I gotta be honest. This is the first Pokemon movie in OVER A DECADE that I can actually say wasn&#039;t absolutely terrible! It&#039;s still not as great as the oldies, but it was ACTUALLY fun to watch, which is something I can&#039;t say about any other Pokemon movie that was released within the past 10 years! Magearna is the best part of this movie. It&#039;s just a really cool Pokemon to look at. This movie made me love a legendary I probably never would&#039;ve cared about, otherwise. They had moments that made me happy and sad, as well as whimsical and entranced in their story and just overall design. I would seriously recommend watching this movie just to see Magearna. This movie won&#039;t blow you away in the story department, but it&#039;s got SOMETHING, at least. So that alone is worth the watch, when compared to the past 10 years of shovelware Pokemon movies.<br />
<br />
Back to the anime, the XY&amp;Z portion of the show is sort of a movie, itself. I may just think that because of how deep these characters are, but the final episodes at the Pokemon League, onward are actually really intense. Now, I&#039;m gonna start talking about the outcome of the Pokemon League and what happens after that. So if you don&#039;t wanna be spoiled, I&#039;d recommend skipping to the final paragraph. So with all the growing Ash had in this journey, and with these specific Pokemon on his team being SIGNIFICANTLY more powerful than teams he&#039;s had in the past. I truly believed that this would finally be the generation that has Ash win the Pokemon League! I thought it was finally time! However, he had some tough competition. There&#039;s this SUPER FRIENDLY rival of his named Sawyer, who is honestly one of the more annoying characters in this show (and voiced by Pikachu in the Japanese version). And there&#039;s also a character named Alain. Alain actually has his own series of spin off episodes that got released throughout the X and Y anime. I won&#039;t spoil what they&#039;re about, but it&#039;s pretty interesting stuff and gives you an idea of what a Pokemon anime without Ash would be like. Honestly, it was cool. And as much as I liked Ash in X and Y, I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing the world of Pokemon through someone else&#039;s eyes.<br />
<br />
But throughout that side series, you see that Alain is a ridiculously powerful trainer. He eventually meets Ash in XY&amp;Z and the two of them become friends and wish to battle each other in the Pokemon League. Ash gets his wish when he goes up against Alain in the FINALS! This is the first time in Pokemon HISTORY that Ash has made it to the FINALS in the Pokemon League! I truly believed that this would be the time that Ash would come out on top. And throughout the whole battle between him and Alain, they make it all seem like it&#039;s going to come true. Ash and Greninja are in COMPLETE control of the battlefield, whenever they&#039;re working together. They make Greninja INTENSE and you just KNOW that they&#039;re gonna win and Ash is FINALLY going to win! .........but he doesn&#039;t. <br />
<br />
As ends up losing to Alain, even though the final attack is done by Greninja, who ends up fainting from exhaustion. This was the most frustrating part of the entire show. This was the PERFECT time for Ash to finally come out on top! I know the show creators have said that if Ash ever won the Pokemon League, his journey would be over. But I KNOW that&#039;s not true! Ash wouldn&#039;t just go home and stare as his 1st place trophy for the rest of his life, whenever he won it. He would go out to a new region to find new Pokemon and go to new places and take on a new challenge. He would NEVER end his journey, as long as there&#039;s still new places to explore in the world of Pokemon. He won 1st place in the Orange League! Did he stop his journey, then? Nope! He became king of the Battle Frontier and was even offered a position as one of the Frontier Brains! Did he take the position? Nope! He continued his journey around the world! So ya. It&#039;s nonsense to say that Ash isn&#039;t allowed to win, or else his journey would be over. He DESERVED to win here and it would&#039;ve been a perfect end to an incredible journey with a character we all grew up with.<br />
<br />
But whatever. Alain wins the Pokemon League. But the show actually doesn&#039;t stop there. Out of nowhere, the final battle with Team Flare begins. And it&#039;s one of the most epic battles with an evil team in Pokemon history! Team Flare&#039;s ambitions are explained in a way that makes them seem a lot more intense and fierce, as opposed to how they were explained in the games. They made Team Flare both incredibly evil and genuinely frightening. So it&#039;s up to not only Ash, but Serena, Clemont, Bonnie, and the unsung heroes of Pokemon, Team Rocker, to stop Team Flare and save the Kalos region. All of them play a huge role in this final battle. Clemont and Bonnie have very deep and emotional moments that were both very sad and incredibly dark for Pokemon standards. Serena didn&#039;t stand out as much as they did, but considering how much her character rocked the rest of the show, I say she gets a pass. As for Ash... <br />
<br />
Let me just say this. The voice actors of both Ash and his traveling companions deserve recognition for how stinkin awesomely they voiced these last couple of episodes. It&#039;s honestly some of, if not the BEST moments of voice acting in the Pokemon anime&#039;s history. Ash sounds truly intense and is able to send chills down your spine with his words, alone. Clemont does just as good of a job as Ash with that, and Bonnie goes from cute mascot, to downright heartbreaking. Seriously. I know a lot of us were real uppity when the Pokemon dub got handed over to a new company and all the voices got changed. But I loved their work in Diamond and Pearl, onward. And now that they&#039;ve been doing the dub LONGER than the original dub, and seeing the performances they gave with these last few episodes of XY&amp;Z, I applaud the heck out of every single person who worked on this show. You all seriously did an amazing job and you should be truly proud of your stellar performances.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Pokemon X and Y is FANTASTIC. It was a million times better than Black and White, the animation is the best it&#039;s ever been, the main human characters are absolutely incredible, and the ending of this series was everything that the ending of Black and White should&#039;ve been. I still think that Diamond and Pearl wins by a hair, in terms of story and overall cast, however. Both of them are fantastic and the absolute highlights of the Pokemon anime. If you&#039;ve been out of the Pokemon anime for a long time and don&#039;t really think it&#039;s worth returning to, I can tell you with total confidence that you WILL like X and Y. As long as you can accept that all the Pokemon and characters and their voice actors from your childhood aren&#039;t there anymore, X and Y will prove to be something truly special and something that can be enjoyed by every Pokemon fan, as well as fans of anime, as a whole.<br />

    Here are my review * sorry, english is not my naive language..<br />
<br />
Story - 9/10<br />
The story did a petty good job here, i already watch all episode till now, and i mean, it still does have a side story, but its about character development and meeting with a new Pokemon. <br />
The story still predictable but not as predictable like the series before it.<br />
Just like the Gym Battle, usually Satoshi(Ash) Pokemon beaten by gym leader new Pokemon after Satoshi beat the Gym Leader Pokemon. But now, he beat it with a strategy and guts. Nice improvement.<br />
<br />
The story is good, so i recommend this season for Pokemon Fans.<br />
<br />
Art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164283">
        - 10/10<br />
The art is like never before, its art is very good, and an outstanding improvement, most of the colorful Background is gone, and the battle is very epic. It get very good point of view in the battle. Especially when Pikachu&#039;s battle.<br />
Recommended to see it.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8/10<br />
The music maybe is not the best of it, but it use the game BGM, its good,<br />
and the opening its not bad but not that good.<br />
8 is more than enough for it.<br />
<br />
Character - 9/10<br />
The new character is Citron and the game heroine, some of us is disspointed with the Takeshi(brock) gone. But with the new companion, its good to see Citron. Especially the Seiyuu is Yuki Kaji. The character development is very intense, every character has its own character and unique. And its bring back memories of Advance Generation.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
With that said, i really did enjoy Pokemon XY, many people say Pokemon XY is bad and many people say Pokemon XY is good. And i&#039;am one of them.<br />
Well, i recommend you to watch it for one who love Pokemon. But be ready for irritated since Pokemon XY did a lot of break. Well, that did&#039;nt decrease my will to watch Pokemon XY.<br />
<br />
Overall - maybe 9/10<br />
Thanx for reading my review, all i did is writing everything in my heart.<br />
Hope this helpful

    Many people will disagree with my low rating, but the fact is - when you watch too much of an anime (this anime has 93 episodes, and still has an XYZ season after it) it becomes it really boring, especially when there&#039;s a formula to an episode. I remember dropping on this anime at about episode 60, then a few months ago I went so far as to watch the XYZ version. The reason for all of this is because every episode, while they do something new, team rocket comes and annoys the hell out of them, then they get their Pokemon back, beat the

        hell out of them, and finally - continue whatever they were gonna do. It gets really repetitive as episodes go by. That&#039;s the reason behind my low rating on the show, even though when I was first watching it  I thought it was amazing. You can&#039;t deny the great animation and sound, which carries the anime to 4. Without them I wouldn&#039;t have it at more than 2, or at most - 3.

    First off, I&#039;ve been a Pokemon fan for a lot of years, started out with the first season and kinda lost interest with B/W hence not follwing that season anymore.<br />
XY made me start over again because the characters seemed very interesting from the PV&#039;s and the art was looking great as well. <br />
In the first place, this review refers to those who have seen older seasons of Pokemon and want an opinion on wether or not XY is worth a watch. Therefore this is mainly my PERSONAL OPINION instead of a rather subjective review. If you do not agree with me that&#039;s fine. ;) <br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180727">
        have to admit, while I loved the way the show started out, it turned out kinda &quot;meh&quot; from a certain point. That doesn&#039;t mean that XY is a bad season - I just think it had a lot more potential.<br />
<br />
First off, the story: Not much to say about that. If you&#039;re familiar with Pokemon, you know how it goes. Traveling, meeting new people, Team Rocket messing something up. Some arena battles every now and then, etc. <br />
There&#039;s some really enjoyable episodes and some rather boring ones. It&#039;s nothing new really. <br />
<br />
Art: The art is awesome. The drawings are detailed and pretty, the character designs are nice, the backgrounds look really awesome and the battles look simply amazing. They&#039;ve done an awesome job here, really. I kinda wish they would&#039;ve gone for a style that was more similar to the older seasons because for me that style &quot;is&quot; Pokemon, but that&#039;s just personal taste and has nothing to do with the actual quality. However, if you&#039;re in for the nostalgia, the drawings might bother you because they look nothing like the old seasons anymore.<br />
<br />
Sound: The sound is pretty good, too. We have some very nostalgic tracks and the voice acting in Pokemon is done well as usual. I don&#039;t like ALL of the OP and ED tracks (but since there&#039;s quite a few of those that&#039;s okay!), but they are all really catchy and fun and put you into the right Pokemon-ish mood.<br />
<br />
Characters: Now let&#039;s get to the core of my review. The thing that made me NOT enjoy XY as much as I wanted to. Don&#039;t get me wrong. The characters aren&#039;t bad. Actually, they are pretty awesome but well.. I just feel like they could&#039;ve been so much MORE.<br />
First off, we got Ash/Satoshi, who&#039;s still his usual self - well, kind of. Obviously he&#039;s still the hero, he&#039;s a little bit dumb and head over heels as usual, but idk, he&#039;s.. different. He doesn&#039;t feel quite like the old Satoshi and for me, that&#039;s a huge bother. I&#039;ve always been a Satoshi kid. I mean, if he would&#039;ve gotten some actual development, that would have been great. But even the &quot;childhood&quot; Satoshi feels different from the &quot;old&quot; one so it&#039;s not development but just changing his character. Not everybody might have noticed this, but I personally don&#039;t like it. <br />
As for Serena, well.. at first I thought she was rather enjoyable, cute and I liked how they gave her some depth through the childhood thing instead of being in for the bike, like the other girls have been. However, she really annoyed me a lot in the later episodes because for about 40 episodes she did literally NOTHING. She didn&#039;t really battle, didn&#039;t catch a Pokemon, didn&#039;t have a goal, just NOTHING. She was in for the shipping and that was that. Which annoyed me to no end because all we got were some forced Serena shipping moments instead of any actual Serena-character. Then again, I love the way they&#039;ve been handeling her lately. In the past few episodes she got a lot of development and I really enjoyed what they did with her. At this point, she might turn into the most well developt main character in a Pokemon season. Keep it up, writers! I just wish you had started this sooner than around 50 episodes in!<br />
As for the other two, let&#039;s just say that I like both of them and I feel like they give something fresh to the show because while they do resemble some of the older companions in a way, they are still something new and it&#039;s interesting to see what they add to the group. <br />
<br />
So much about the characters on their own, what I find just as important is the interactions between the characters - another thing I feel like XY is lacking.<br />
Satoshi and Citron have some enjoyable interactions. Eureka and Serena have some enjoyable interactions. So do Citron and Eureka. <br />
As for Satoshi and Serena, it&#039;s okay. Some people might disagree with me because I know how Amourshipping has gotten popular as hell but for me personally, it just feels really forced.. like, the writers tried so hard to add in a romance that it kinda destroyed it for me. I feel like they lack just the little, &quot;unimportant&quot; things, everytime they interact with each other it&#039;s turned into a huge deal and some of those &quot;shipping moments&quot; feel so forced to me like they add nothing to the actual episode and are just there to throw a romance into your face. About that, I also feel like that just doesn&#039;t fit into Pokemon. You can argue about every relationship Satoshi ever had with a girl (even with Kasumi) but it&#039;s impossible for anybody to NOT notice Serena has a crush on Satoshi. And I don&#039;t feel like that fits into a Pokemon show because for me, Pokemon is about FRIENDSHIP, not love. Love should be up to everyone&#039;s interpretation, imo. <br />
I mean, I get why some people like it, but I just don&#039;t feel it. <br />
<br />
As for Serena and Citron or Eureka and Satoshi... they barely have any interaction at all and that bothers me as well. The show focuses so much on certain relationships that they completely miss out on others. That doesn&#039;t really make me feel for the group as a group and since the group is a huge factor  of the Pokemon show for me, it makes me not like the season as much as the previous ones. <br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed was that XY kinda seperates between genders in a way the other seasons didn&#039;t do. It&#039;s kinda hard to explain, but we have a lot of girls this, girls that, boys this and boys that, while the other seasons were more neutral about this (eg. Serena once says how &quot;all girls should be pretty&quot; or something like this and the &quot;new contests&quot; are also pretty &quot;girlish&quot;. It&#039;s not really a huge deal, but I just feel like that was not necessary - they never did it before, why do it now? <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Despite that, XY does have it&#039;s moments and it IS a great season. I think it all depends on how you manage to get into the group as a group and I know that some people love those 4 to pieces. If that is the case for you, XY might turn into the best Pokemon season to date for you - because it&#039;s definitly strong in it&#039;s other aspects. But even if, like me, you feel like those 4 are lacking, XY is worth a watch. It does incredibly well for a Pokemon season and it got me back into the anime for a reason.

    Yes, we&#039;re back to talking about Pokemon, a franchise so long running that there are adults who weren&#039;t born yet when it started. I was, but I&#039;m old and crabby. Any way, I was asked to review this particular part of the anime. So, all of you get to read me ranting about all the aspects of this anime franchise that get on my nerves. Besides, with Sword and Shield coming out soon and eliminating the Megas, it seems a good time to talk about when Game Freak was super proud of that element. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
We open with Satoshi travelling over to the Kalos region leaving Unova

          <span style="display: none;" id="review313233">
        and all the Pokemon he &quot;befriended&quot; there behind. He meets the siblings, Citron &amp; Eureka, and begins his journey to beat all the Kalos gyms while catching new Pokemon he&#039;ll inevitably leave behind when he moves on to Alola. Unfortunately for him, Musashi, Kojirou &amp; Meowth are still following him to steal his Pikachu. <br />
<br />
I should note, the anime does not follow the game&#039;s mechanics as much as it makes nods to them. Which I can&#039;t really complain about. It would be even more boring if Pikachu had to dodge every attack because any hit would smash its frail defences and knock it the fuck out. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the series is just that it&#039;s all very repetitive and formulaic. You can pretty much tell exactly what&#039;s going to happen in an episode the moment the scenario is introduced. Satoshi will even say he hasn&#039;t decided which gym to go to next after every gym match, even against the 7th gym when there&#039;s literally one option left. <br />
<br />
In all fairness, the series can have a real sense of fun to it. And Team Rocket&#039;s goofy schemes can be entertaining even if we know every one is going to end with them getting blasted into the air and saying &quot;this feels bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
This is where the big problem in the series lies. The main characters are dull. Really, excruciatingly dull. Satoshi has no personality whatsoever. He&#039;s just vaguely amicable. Which is part of the problem with the franchise keeping the same protagonist from region to region. The dude can&#039;t learn any lessons without repeating old territory. He also can&#039;t develop as a character because every writer who works on the anime has a cemented image of him and what he&#039;s supposed to be. And it is hard to see him as having a real connection with his pokemon when he has a long history of saying goodbye to them at the slightest provocation. <br />
<br />
Then there are his companions. Citron is a boring sciencey boy who makes machines that blow up and is vaguely nice. Eureka is an excitable child who thinks every Pokemon ever is cute. Even the shite ice cream cone no one likes. And tries to get her brother a bride whenever she thinks a woman is pretty. Serena is a girly girl with a crush on Satoshi because they met once in camp when they were all of eight. <br />
<br />
The best characters are Musashi, Kojirou &amp; Meowth. Just because they&#039;re allowed to be bad and revel in that but there&#039;s also a real attempt at making them sympathetic. Every member of the group gets some episode or other that showcases the better part of their nature. This also serves to make them more enjoyable than the main cast as well as more complex. <br />
<br />
Art: <br />
<br />
The artwork is fine. There are some pretty cool battles. The characters look fine. And the Pokemon look like their game counterparts. I don&#039;t really care for most of the 6th generation Pokemon personally, but that may be because I&#039;m old and grumpy. You damn kids and your cotton candy pokemon and your slime dragons and your key rings and your pogs and your street sharks. <br />
<br />
Sound: <br />
<br />
The acting is fine. Everyone is perfectly competent but most of the characters are so boring they don&#039;t have much in terms of complexity to convey. Which is why our best performances come from Hayashibara Megumi, Miki Shinichiro &amp; Inuyama Inuko. The music is decent enough too. Not great but functional enough. <br />
<br />
Ho-yay:<br />
<br />
There are some moments with Serena and Sana. Eureka&#039;s obsession with pretty women also seems to be a strong indication that she won&#039;t be dating men when she gets older. <br />
<br />
Areas of Improvement:<br />
<br />
Ditch Satoshi as the main protagonist. Honestly, I think the Pokemon anime franchise would be a lot better if each region featured a new protagonist. You could get more complexity for the character without having to undermine their bond with their pokemon to show off the new region&#039;s creatures. <br />
Have some surprises. I get it, this is a children&#039;s anime and they can&#039;t get too complex with it. But at least have some events that are mildly against the grain or that subvert expectations. Maybe even let the villains win in some minor way that isn&#039;t too bad for the heroes. <br />
More personality for the protagonists. A big part of the issue with them is that the writers try to make them too squeaky clean good. Give them some real flaws to overcome that can lead to some interesting interactions. It would make the series a lot more interesting. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts:<br />
<br />
Pokemon XY isn&#039;t a bad series. However, it&#039;s not a good one either. It&#039;s like that last Pokemon film I reviewed. It&#039;s a mediocre series that&#039;s probably enjoyable enough for the target audience, but doesn&#039;t provide much for anyone older. Even slightly older like teenagers. I&#039;ll give it a 5/10.

    At first I wonder why this anime can get such a high score.. I mean, it&#039;s just same like before..<br />
<br />
First, the Satoshit we know for over a decade continue his adventure through new region called Kalos, with his suddenly being lamed (again) pikachu with no maturation at all. He&#039;s just like before, didn&#039;t change at all, still being silly, and so on. <br />
<br />
Second, now we got a new companion, and interestingly the girls is such Satoshit&#039;s... childhood friend? oh okay, but she has nothing interesting, so are the other characters. <br />
<br />
Third, team rocket has come back as usual, being blasted off again and again. Nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123517">
        that is interesting.<br />
<br />
The only good thing is the art. Well, since diamond and pearl they had used such a good art, though..<br />
<br />
At last, all I can say is maybe the only one who can enjoy this kind of anime is no other than fanatic pokefan. The other may just get boring so fast, especially they who&#039;ve seen pokemon&#039;s previous season.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m waiting for the movies instead of continuing the anime that most likely can be predictable and stalling its episodes longer and longer

    I&#039;ve been a Pokemon fan for many years, and I used to watch the anime every weekend with excitement. Like many others, I lost interest eventually. I checked the BW season out, only to be extremely disappointed. At that point I thought I might never bother with the Pokemon anime again. Alas, was I wrong.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not sure why, but when XY started airing I decided to check it out, and I was pleasantly surprised. The anime was once again enjoyable and entertaining!<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 5.5/10<br />
This being Pokemon, don&#039;t expect any mind blowing plot twists or amazing story telling, but I think the story has been decent so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review182715">
        far. XY follows a similar formula as AG (3 companions, Ash doesn&#039;t own all the starters etc.), but it also brings plenty of new things so you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re just re-watching AG.<br />
<br />
I was surprised to see the writers do a few things that one wouldn&#039;t normally expect from the Pokemon anime. One more thing to note is that there are few filler episodes so far, and most of them have been rather enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art of the anime has improved a lot throughout the years. XY being the latest season, it has the best art and animation so far. The background art is rather pretty, and effects in battles look great. You might notice more effort put in some episodes than others (usually the &quot;important&quot; episodes), but overall it&#039;s good enough.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Most of the soundtracks are based on those from the XY games. If you liked the game soundtracks, chances are you&#039;ll like these too. If you didn&#039;t, it might be a hit or miss. Personally, I like the them.<br />
<br />
Characters: 7.5/10<br />
I might be a little biased here because I adore the current group so take this with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
This is my favourite group out of all the Pokemon seasons I&#039;ve watched so far. I&#039;m not talking about the individual characters (I&#039;ll get to that in a bit), but how the characters function and interact as a group.<br />
<br />
They really feel like a group of good friends traveling together and learning from each other, more so than the previous groups. There&#039;s Ash, Clemont (the 5th Gym leader), Clemont&#039;s little sister Bonnie, and Serena a (ret-conned) childhood friend of Ash&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Ash and Clemont have a nice brother-like relationship, and seem to support each other a lot. Likewise, Serena and Bonnie share an older-sister younger-sister bond. Serena even protected Bonnie on a few occasions. Ash and Serena mutually inspire and support each other, even more so once Serena starts working on her goal/dream. Clemont and Bonnie, the actual siblings, will occasionally have some disagreements, but they do care for each other a lot, and Bonnie never misses a chance to tease her older brother. Serena and Clemont haven&#039;t had a lot of interaction admittedly, but you could tell they get along and Clemont trusts Serena enough to let her take care of Bonnie after a certain event.<br />
<br />
I was happy to see Ash not reset, and turned into a clueless rookie like in BW. I know there are a lot of people who are sick and tired of him, but I&#039;ve quite enjoyed his character so far. I won&#039;t necessarily say he&#039;s more &quot;mature&quot;, but you can at least see him have a level of experience. I have to admit though, after watching the whole season, his character did get a little stale.<br />
<br />
Clemont is a Gym Leader who decides to travel with Ash to gain more experience. He loves inventing robots and machines to improve the life of Pokemon and humans alike. His inventions are usually played for laughs as they will go out of control and explode, but he did make a few great inventions as you&#039;ll find out throughout the series. Initially, Clemont didn&#039;t involve himself with things that much, plus he&#039;s really not physically fit, but he seems to want to step up and get more involved because Ash inspires him to do better.<br />
<br />
Serena started her journey in order to meet Ash, after she found out he&#039;s in the Kalos region, but she also wanted an excuse to avoid training for Rhyhorn racing. Her mother is a Rhyhorn racer, but Serena doesn&#039;t seem fond of it. In fact, she&#039;s not quite sure what she wants to do. For a long time Serena was somewhat of a background character, not really doing much. She was kind of a passive, but pleasant person. She eventually found a dream in becoming a Pokemon Performer (something similar to Contests) and became a much more active character ever since. My only complaint is that her dream/character focus started pretty late making her goal rather lackluster, on top of the fact that she was essentially neglected for a good amount of episodes. Good character, but poorly handled early on.<br />
<br />
Bonnie is absolutely adorable. Since she&#039;s too young to have her own Pokemon so there is only so much she can contribute, but she has her moments. Her focus episodes are usually among the best ones, and Bonnie is easily my favourite character from the anime.<br />
<br />
The Pokemon characters themselves have been pretty good, too. They are lovable, and have distinct personalities. Each one has their own quirks, and they aren&#039;t annoying in any way. Team Rocket is back to being their goofy selves, although their writing in some episodes is questionable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8.5/10<br />
So far I&#039;ve enjoyed Pokemon XY a lot. There are a few things that make me roll my eyes, like when they use some recycled plot ideas, or when the anime ignores game mechanics or logic, but these are some of those things you need to accept and &quot;ignore&quot; because they&#039;ve been present in the anime since the beginning, and you&#039;re better off not getting worked up over them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 7.5/10<br />
The season was really enjoyable. Good battles. A lot of great episodes. The group seems to get along a little too much making it somewhat unrealistic. On the other hand, many characters in the anime are unrealistically friendly and too trusting of others so I don&#039;t consider it as a major flaw considering the anime&#039;s history. <br />
<br />
There is a lack of conflict and tension due to the absence of a rival or a villain team, but things change in the following season Pokemon XY&amp;Z.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re a Pokemon fan, I suggest giving this season a try, and see if you like it, even if you haven&#039;t watched the anime for years. If you aren&#039;t really that much into Pokemon anymore, you might not like it.<br />
<br />
Revised: 12/03/16<br />

As a huge pokemon fan, i gotta say that this season of pokemon which is pokemon XY caught my attention in one swoop just by watching the first 2 episode, i can see that they made so many changes throughout the series n i say the XY series is the best that i&#039;ve seen, the Ash(Satoshi) that we all know seems to have become more matured compared to the Black &amp;amp; White series. This series is way beyond my expectation, the battles, characters, storyline n many more have all been improved, i get a feeling that this XY series will have the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review125629">
        highest rating among any other pokemon series, i spent 4 years in my life watching the very start of pokemon series untill the current series which is XY, but never have i felt the kind of excitement that i have for XY series, i know that the english version of XY series has only released 2 episodes at the moment, however i couldn&#039;t stop my excitement in which i end up watching the japanese version(which is currently at episode 11), i could say that there might be romance in this pokemon series however i won&#039;t get my hopes high, i just sincerely hoped that this new series of pokemon would include romance in it, as to those who have seen the future episodes( i won&#039;t spoil the story, you guys just have to watch it when the time comes), i know that all the pokemon fans out there will enjoy this series more since they have include the mega evolution and all( !!SPOILER!! !!ALERT!! Where they can mega evolved into a way more powerful pokemon however it is not a permanent evolution) and that during battles they decide to include sountracks from the first pokemon game/series, let&#039;s all hope that the storyline will continue just as interesting as we have now.<br />
<br />
To those who haven&#039;t watch, im very sorry for kind of spoiling some of it even though i said i won&#039;t spoil it.

    This season of Pokemon is like none other. I haven&#039;t felt this invested or entertained by a season of Pokemon since Misty&#039;s departure. For once, I am excited for episodes. I want to know what&#039;s happening. Also, there are a lot of tear-jerking episodes this season, and a bunch of cool new Pokemon to meet!<br />
<br />
What I love most of all is that Ash and Pikachu weren&#039;t &quot;reset&quot;. They keep all of the power and knowledge they got in Black and White. And Ash reuses battle strategies! Yes! Finally! He&#039;s used several strategies in the past that has been extremely effective and he just never used

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179575">
        them again. <br />
<br />
Ash is very battle smart this time around. He meets Pokemon and he instinctively knows what they need, particularly in the case of Hawlucha. <br />
<br />
The companions are really amazing too. A different dynamic to the rest, but honestly this time around their friendship really feels like a friendship and not just three to four people walking from city to city. <br />
<br />
Clemont is the brains of the operation, and brings along his little sister Bonnie who is really enthusiastic about Pokemon (like Max) but acts her age and is really excitable (unlike Max). <br />
<br />
Serena is the love interest whom is searching for her own dream. I found that to be really believable. With the rest of the female companions, they just instinctively know what they want, but with Serena it takes time. She doesn&#039;t rush it. <br />
<br />
Her dynamic with Ash is what keeps me hooked. I can actually see those two getting together and being happy. I haven&#039;t felt that way since Misty, but now I feel it more than ever. She and Ash just ... work. During most, if not all, of Ash&#039;s gym battles, her mere presence seems to help him out of a tough spot. She doesn&#039;t need to say anything. He looks at her and he knows what he needs to do. I hope once XY wraps up, Serena tags along with Ash to the next region.<br />
<br />
Pokemon XY is just so mature this time around. They&#039;ve finally, FINALLY got it right and I hope they don&#039;t change it. <br />
<br />
The music is amazing too. It gets really intense during gym battles and sucks you in so completely you can&#039;t look away from the screen. You cheer, you get emotional, and overall you just feel so happy. Where the hell was this the entire time?!<br />
<br />
And the art! THE ART! It&#039;s so beautiful! Everything is just so crisp and clean and so well done. It&#039;s very aesthetically pleasing.<br />
<br />
Overall, I am enjoying XY so much. I don&#039;t want it to end, because they&#039;ve finally gotten it right. They&#039;ve got a cast of characters that just mesh so well.

    Pokemon, you hear the word and a barrage of memories flow in your mind. If you grew up with Pokemon like I have, then chances are you are in the process of watching this series like I am. I was skeptical at first, mostly due to the fact that I saw these new Pokemon as &quot;unoriginal&quot; and &quot;bland&quot;. Well let me tell you, I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10- So far, 52 episodes in, I find the story like your average Pokemon adventure. Ash travels to a new region, meets people along the way, catches Pokemon, earns badges, and of course, battles Team Rocket over and over

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196643">
        again. This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing though, considering the repetition of these events has been pretty much the same since the first series aired well over a decade ago.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10- I&#039;m not a picky person when it comes to actual animation or art in anime, but this series is quite beautiful. The effects go as far as seeing the sun hit the characters faces when in the woods, which is a really neat shading effect. Not too much to explain here other than the characters, setting, and Pokemon are wonderfully animated.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10- Another aspect I&#039;m not too picky of, but the battle music during Pokemon battles always brings back a nostalgic feeling, even in new series such as this. I&#039;m sure at least a few of you have noticed, but the characters voices seem almost bland if not exaggerated at times. That is my only concern. Then again this is &quot;technically&quot; a children&#039;s show.<br />
<br />
Character 7/10- The characters all have their own back story and growth, but I can&#039;t seem to get past how much they drag on over one event. Sure there&#039;s a new event every episode or two, but it goes to borderline annoying at some points when seeing how some events play out. No biggie though, this is definitely a pretty good series so far.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10- Despite a few flaws, it&#039;s near impossible to turn my back on a childhood series such as this. It&#039;s a pure classic, and even though I&#039;ll be 20 next month, I still find myself watching at least one episode of this series every night or so.<br />
<br />
Overall 8/10- If you&#039;re a Pokemon fan and haven&#039;t started this yet, I highly recommend you do so. Don&#039;t be like me and judge an anime by its looks, because chances are you may miss out on a nostalgic trip with Ash and Pikachu.<br />
<br />
Well if you got this far all I can say is thank you! This is my first review so please cut me some slack a little haha. If you felt this was helpful give me a one up so I can feel good about myself :) thanks again everyone!

    When it comes to the Pokemon anime, many people make the mistake to assume it can be taken as a single anime. Each &quot;cycle&quot; is very different from the others, whether that be the narrative or the art style.<br />
As such, it must always be taken as several shows. If some of them are really bad (especially the first one and Best Wishes), some of them are absolutely amazing, for various reasons.<br />
<br />
Pokemon XY is an awesome shônen, with epic fights, a decent story (although not flawless), and an excellent art style.<br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
The story in Pokemon evolved a lot. After 15 seasons, they learned to create deeper characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295345">
        with decent stories. They also made a very respectable Ash.<br />
Pokemon XY is still about Ash and Pikachu on their way to become a Pokemon Master. But now, they are at a whole different level than they were in the beginning. They have several Leagues of experience, which serve them a lot as they often defeat their opponents hands down.<br />
<br />
Aside from Ash, the story introduces Serena (who first follows Ash only by love, but then finds her way thanks to the Tripokalon, a contest show), and Citron and Eureka (a Gym Leader and his little sister, who travel across the region for fun).<br />
If these companions don&#039;t tell much story in the beginning, Serena&#039;s character becomes way more interesting when she starts practicing for Tripokalon.<br />
<br />
But for now, all that is quite basic in Pokemon. Luckily, XY also has a lot of other stories revolving around several other characters. In fact, it is divided into small arcs (which makes this show look much more like a shônen, Naruto style).<br />
<br />
<br />
Long story short, this anime tells decent stories, sadly they are quite independent from each other, which makes it feel a little broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
ART<br />
Pokemon XY is simply amazing.<br />
<br />
The drawings and environments are stunning, and the light effects are absolutely wonderful. The second opening starts with a view during dawn, and it is definitely the BEST dawn I&#039;ve ever seen in japanimation, the colors really catch up the feels of a true dawn.<br />
<br />
The animation is also excellent. It is among the best we can find in japanimation, AND it&#039;s also way less rare than in other anime. My point is, in an anime, we often have to wait for around 5 episodes before we get one cool action scene, and that usually lasts only a few minutes. Do you see what I mean?<br />
That&#039;s not the case in Pokemon XY. ALL the fights have an excellent animation, and this show is all about fights.<br />
<br />
Finally, the show is very dynamic. The battles feel intense thanks to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
Pokemon has always had an excellent OST (in the original version, of course ; in dubs, the OST has been ruined a lot). Imo, this series has the best openings of the whole show (Volt is epic, Get Ban Ban feels very good to hear, and XYZ is pure rock).<br />
<br />
The music themes are memorable, especially Ash-Greninja&#039;s theme.<br />
<br />
Finally, the seiyuus do a wonderful job, as usual. Note that Citron is voiced by Yuki Kaji, the same as Eren in AoT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
Across the seasons (except BW), Ash became strong, learned a lot, and now in XY, he is BADASS and hardly defeatable. Yes, you heard right.<br />
While they do sometimes make him lose for the sake of suspense, in this series Ash is a beast in Pokemon Battles, he often one shots his opponents and is even considered a mentor by many other characters. While Ash is often criticized as a character, his XY version is mature and badass, and is a real fighter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ash&#039;s new friends are charming, but it takes time before they tell decent stories. In fact, their characters really stand out only in the second half, particularly in the last season, XYZ. Eureka befriends a Legendary Pokemon, Citron prepares for his Gym Battle against Ash and also has to degend his City against Team Flare.<br />
<br />
But the secondary characters are really what makes XY stand out as a Pokemon anime. Many of them have a very interesting and progressive story. Among them:<br />
- Corni, a Gym Leader owner of a Lucario, must learn to control the Mega-Evolution to become stronger ;<br />
- Allan, who first wants to defeat all the Mega-Evolution, then has to fight with Team Flare to save his friend&#039;s Pokemon (which fell into a coma) ;<br />
- the star of this show : Greninja, who first evolves to his final stage and then reveals a whole new evolution called Battle Bond.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s always hard to describe the characters in a Pokemon show, because there&#039;s plenty of them.<br />
<br />
Long story short : in Pokemon XY, many characters stand out thanks to their interesting story.<br />
The way things keep progressing is really worth it, and watching this series it really feels like everyone grows up and evolves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
There are two Pokemon anime that I find excellent: DP and XY.<br />
The reasons are different, though. While the story in XY is not flawless, it makes up for it with very interesting characters, very cool story arcs, and an excellent art style.<br />
It&#039;s definitely worth watching, if you skip the fillers.

    Pokemon XY is the worst series in the whole Pokemon anime. Its nothing like the classic anime. Its very poorly made, and has VERY annoying characters. Im a huge fan of the pokemon series, but this is horrible compared to the other series in the anime.<br />
<br />
Story line4/10-THERE ARE NO SPOILERS. Once again, Ash is ready for a new adventure in the Kalos region. He once again collects gym badges, working to become the best trainer. Its the say as any other pokemon series. Its somewhat enjoyable. I mean, its easy to fall in love with the story line, and its not the worst, but its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review203131">
        the same for every story line. I dont hate it, but for XY, its more dumber. <br />
<br />
Characters2/10-This is the worst part. The characters are very annoying. Bonnie is the worst. She is very poorly made, and never gets mature. Serena is another girl who loves Ash, but shes like a filler because Ash never seemed to know her until Serena tells him the story. Serena was made really only to be annoying, like Bonnnie. Team Rocket is funny, like always. But their the only good characters. Everyone else are annoying and stupid. Ash is even more dumber them before.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack5/10-At least the anime doesnt fail to much here. The Soundtrack is not bad, just okay. Its enjoyable, but not as good as other pokemon soundtracks. <br />
<br />
Art7/10-This is the best part. The art is quite good. The art for the pokemon attacks look great. However, the character design isnt so good. Since Ash doesnt look so great for art design. Its just good, not as good as other art for other pokemon series, but still okay.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment3/10-No,I didnt enjoy Pokemon XY. It was a poor anime. The characters are like a joke,the soundtrack has gotten worse,the art isnt that great,and the storyline is stupid. There is no enjoyment. Well,a little,but barely. <br />
<br />
Overall3/10-Pokemon XY is a boring series. There is very little enjoyment. I do not recommend this series for any pokemon. The pokemon are also strange looking. Keys, Pumpkins, Slug dragons, Cotton Candy, whats next, fry pans, Spoons, forks, pants, hats? LOL. Anyways, Pokemon XY is terrible, dont watch it.

    Okay, OLM, you did better this time.<br />
I&#039;ll give you that.<br />
<br />
Ash is competent in battle again, well mostly.<br />
You brought back contests, sort of.<br />
His companions are useful and complimentary. I even see myself in Clemont.<br />
My biggest issue though, it takes too much time for miss Serena to do anything and her calling isn&#039;t even in the games. <br />
This generation in general has been strange to the max. Sure, we had representation of both Kalos and Hoenn Pokémon in the series, but NOT ONE that was obtained for the main team was from Hoenn. NOT ONE. You had the odd other regions which works mind you but were

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215565">
        jarring to say the least. You know, I missed that from Diamond and Pearl where they advertised Johto BEAUTIFULLY in the story. Every main character had a Johto mon at least once in the show. Instead, the secondary characters have the Hoenn Pokémon, and Ash and company have mainly Kalos. Ash also has a HUGE affinity to one type in this particular series and it seems to be meant for one feature of the games which only is explored officially ONCE. Oh and there&#039;s a release in this series that pissed off me and many others, which made me hate Iris even more. It&#039;s definitely an improvement from stupid Best Wishes (the games are still great mind you), but it had a few steps back.

    As a fan of the Pokemon series since it&#039;s inception, this anime knocked the socks off of me. Ash has retained brain cells (Thank you creators), the battle scenes are actually pretty good (thanks for not slacking off), and the development of the characters, not just Ash but all the main characters was great. <br />
<br />
<br />
*will contain spoilers ranging from minor to major spoilers* <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
I literally cannot find anything wrong with the story. Yes, it&#039;s still the Ash travels throughout the region to battle gym leaders to join the Pokemon League, but there&#039;s nothing wrong with using this storyline if the journey is interesting. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289241">
        never saw a dull moment or a boring episode, even if some were considered fillers. In my opinion, what really makes or breaks how I feel about any anime is how they do their filler episodes and incorporate it so it doesn&#039;t deviate too far from the main storyline. The filler episodes in this were well thought out and are interesting, even though they don&#039;t explore the main storyline. The filler episodes actually had thought put into them and explored the premise of the main Pokemon it revolved around (or character) such as the Trevenant episode and Salamance / Wigglytuff episode. <br />
<br />
What sets X, Y (&amp;Z) apart from the rest is the storyline of each side character, especially the storyline of Bonnie &amp; Serena. Bonnie plays a key plot point in the second half of X, Y (&amp;Z) with her relationship with &#039;Squishy&#039;. Bonnie throughout this storyline develops as a character as her innocence of a child is what drives her relationship with &#039;Squishy&#039; and helps develop the main plotline. Serena as main girl companion of Ash was probably the best thing the writers actually gave us. She&#039;s not someone that disses Ash constantly (e.g: Misty, May, Dawn, Iris) but sees Ash as someone who he is, as someone who has a genuine care and love for Pokemon. This is what separates Serena from the rest of the main girls. Serena is first portrayed as a typical &#039;girly&#039; type stereotype of someone not interested in Pokemon. She cares about Fashion, hates battling, and uses (insert boy name) as a crutch. However, throughout the season, we see Serena grow as a character, as she matures an realizes her self-worth is more than just Fashion and contest battling, it&#039;s been her own strong independent self. She doesn&#039;t use other people as a crutch on why she&#039;s not good at (insert) skill, she improves herself, and grows along with her Pokemon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Classic Pokemon style of drawing and animation, do I need to explain more? The battlings are a lot more clear, and more detail is added during certain moves which nice to see. Also, the CGI &amp; drawing of nature is used spectacularly in this anime. Sometimes the art for nature is highly disregarded in anime which is extremely disappointing so you&#039;ll see some poorly drawn tree or root, but not in this season. This season they put a more realistic touch on nature which was beautiful to watch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
It&#039;s good ol&#039; classic Pokemon music. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn&#039;t wow me like other seasons have had (such as Diamond &amp; Pearl). <br />
<br />
Character: 10/10<br />
The development of characters is the best out of all the other series (and other animes). Not only does the main group of travelers develop, but so do the side-side character (Alan,), and the Pokemon as well! First off, Serena, Clement &amp; Bonnie all have amazing storylines and their journey with Ash really helps them learn and grow as a Pokemon trainer, but as people as well. Serena becomes independent and realizes even though she may fail, the value of herself is not lessened. Clement gains the confidence he needs and is reassured with his own battling skills. Bonnie grows as a child learning more about the world while still retaining her child-like innocence. Side characters like Alain &amp; Sawyer were probably the most interesting development as a character I&#039;ve ever seen. Alain is a character I&#039;ve never thought I would see in the Pokemon series. Even if he took a different path from Ash, he was not someone I could hate, and I enjoyed his development. Another character that was very interesting to see develop throughout this series was Sawyer. Sawyer is basically the book-smart (smogon) trainer. His character is extremely studious and uses his analytical skills rather than the common sense of battling. As someone who has played the games all the way through, I&#039;ve met many players who thought of battling just like Sawyer, and saw everything analytically and didn&#039;t use any sense of just battling skills. <br />
<br />
And the Pokemon, the development of the Pokemon just pushes it over the edge of me. Each of Ash&#039;s Pokemon develops as characters in this story making you love each and every one of his Pokemon. But it&#039;s not just limited to the development of Ash&#039;s Pokemon, it&#039;s the development of Serena, Clement &amp; Bonnie&#039;s Pokemon. For me, my favorite development was between Hawlucha &amp; Froakie. Hawlucha is very different from most of Ash&#039;s Pokemon as he is very prideful and wants to prove he&#039;s the best by ending things very flashy-like. As a fan, I knew a battle would be good when Hawlucha was in it (except the end one but it&#039;s not your fault). His battling style and just his personality, in general, was fun to watch. His personality is also the best thing ever created and developed by the writers. I&#039;ve never seen a Pokemon grow so much as a character in terms of personality as much as Hawlucha has throughout the Kalos region. (*spoiler if you want* but look up fist bump with Froakie and be amazed or Hawlucha&#039;s battle suit) <br />
Froakie as a character was another a favorite of mine. He has almost the same relationship with Ash, that he has with Charmander (now Charizard), however, Froakie never lost the respect of Ash for being weak. Froakie and his development and relationship with Ash is the main driving point for this anime which was beautiful to watch from beginning to end. Also, Goomy, I may be biased because you&#039;re my favorite Pokemon of the Kalos region but your development as a character was beautiful and I&#039;m so proud of you for standing up for what you believe in and protecting others. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:10/10<br />
I was thoroughly entertained by this anime. Not only by the plot but the characters as well. Watching the friendship bloom between humans characters and their Pokemon was probably the most well done out of all the series which was pleasant to watch. This actually became the anime I looked forward to watching every week to see what happened next. Also, Hawlucha, I thank you for joining Ash&#039;s team because the majority of my enjoyment came from you and your actions throughout this anime. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
Story, Character, Art all were amazing. X, Y (&amp;Z) spoiled us Pokemon fans with amazing plots and I swear, if it was up to the writers and creators of the Anime, this would&#039;ve ended a lot differently. But alas, Ash must continue to a new region thus the ending was slightly disappointing (because the writers probably wanted him to win this region tbh). <br />
<br />
Watch this anime and be spoiled by everything that should be in a Pokemon anime from fun battles to fun characters and bonds developed to the actual journey of exploring the World of Pokemon.<br />
Don&#039;t watch this anime if you don&#039;t want to be spoiled and would like to know that every other Pokemon anime will probably pale in comparison (sorry Kanto &amp; Hoenn region). <br />

    To be honest, this was probably my least favorite region in the anime. I think that too much time was spent on Ash-Greninja (which didn&#039;t even go anywhere), time that could have been spent on some much-needed character development (I&#039;m looking at you Serena!), or something more involving the Gen 3 remakes. For Fire Red and Leaf Green, there was a whole season with Ash going back to Kanto, for Heart Gold and Soul Silver, there were a few episodes in which people from Johto join Ash &amp; crew, but for Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the most we get are the Pikachu costumes, which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review277443">
        are incorporated into only one episode and a cameo in the Hoopa movie. I also think Ash acts very out of character throughout the series. He acts way too mature for Ash, and loses his goofiness. The kind of crazy antics that go on in the other series (see the Sinnoh episode Where No Togepi Has Gone Before! to get an idea of what I mean) is virtually absent, and in Pokémon Performances, the competitors are all girls, and the tasks are all &quot;girly&quot; things, like baking and fashion designing. I also think Serena needs to get a life, and realize that Ash&#039;s density is that of cement, and he doesn&#039;t have that kind of romantic attatchment to her, or anybody, really. Serena&#039;s personality in general left something to be desired; she loves fashion, hates getting dirty, and doesn&#039;t think her Mom is cool. I wish she wasn&#039;t so... stereotypically girly. I did enjoy Clemont and Bonnie, and I wish more was done with them. So, overall, I think Kalos could have been executed much better.

    Let&#039;s be honest here. After the mess that was Best Wishes, I didn&#039;t really want to watch the Pokemon anime anymore. That was until I saw the trailer for the 1hr Special for the first two Pokemon XY episodes. I was pretty surprised and eager to see how far this would have played out. And I wasn&#039;t disappointed! <br />
<br />
First of: Story 6/10<br />
Pokemon anime guys! Don&#039;t ever expect too much plot! But... I really was NOT expecting plot. While a little more romance than usual thanks to Serena, there is a plot for the XY series currently going on, with some of the key characters and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review210021">
        plots being introduced in the Mega Evolution Specials. Others, such as the rivals, get their own specific episode story. A good example would be Sanpei, who&#039;s story you would not really pay attention to until you realize how plot relevant it is during the XY&amp;Z saga.<br />
<br />
However, I would compare the story content to Ruby &amp; Sapphire or Diamond and Pearl level. Progressing along a little slower than both, however, due to focusing more on world building and characterisation.<br />
<br />
Art 9/10<br />
One of the best quality art/animation I&#039;ve seen since... well, Pokemon DP? But it is very obvious that it has improved leaps and bounds. Art style is different from the normal, Ash looking older (Probably to match Serena), and Serena looks her age instead of a ten year old (And they worked in the whole fashion aspect of XY too!). <br />
<br />
Attack animations are MUCH BETTER, actually showing the movements of the Pokemon as the scenery moves along instead of a colored background, and attacks looking more accurate than their usual depiction. Flow of movements actually looks smoother than usual.<br />
<br />
Scenery... since this is based off France it is perfectly understandable that the scenery is beautifully detailed.<br />
<br />
And of course there is the use of the VS panel! A surprising inclusion, but it does up the tension a little for official matches.<br />
<br />
Sound 9/10<br />
The score for XY was beautiful in game, but when transposing it for a live band/orchestra... Well... thumbs up and cheers all around as it is the most amazing thing I&#039;ve heard yet!<br />
<br />
Opening songs and closing songs were all really good, the first two openings getting you pumped for the adventure ahead, the third, giving you a sense of travelling and the experiences. <br />
<br />
The first two ending songs were both light hearted and cute, with the second definitely about the peaceful fun days the XY gang goes through. The third ending is both the insert song for Serena, and most likely her theme song, talking about her pursuing her dreams.  The fourth is back to light hearted and cute, talking about the Pokemon themselves mostly having fun.<br />
<br />
Insert song wise: Brilliantly is actually Citron/Clemont&#039;s theme song, but shows up pretty much every time a character is in need of a supportive push and gets through. Beautiful and encouraging! (Its also one of the rare insert songs that made its way into the Pokemon anime)<br />
<br />
Character 8/10<br />
Best characterisation in the series so far, all the characters actually having motivations, backstories, character expansion episodes, and occasionally story arcs of their own. THIS INCLUDES THE POKEMON!<br />
<br />
In fact almost every single Pokemon this season has a proper backstory and reason for joining the team, same going for Team Rocket&#039;s new members.<br />
<br />
But the best thing? While Ash hasn&#039;t exactly matured much... HE&#039;S THINKING THROUGH HIS BATTLES!!!! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment is 9/10<br />
Not that I haven&#039;t enjoyed the anime before, but as stated earlier, I lost interest in the Pokemon anime and skipped most of Best Wishes because it was an utter failure in my eyes. Episode N was its only redeeming quality.<br />
<br />
XY has brought that enjoyment back. Actually going a little deeper into lore, having several side plots key to the actual anime, the game villains actually set to make their appearance. Battles are more fun, strategic, and entertaining. Musical score is gorgeous. Art was better this season than most. Less filler episodes than usual, most of them contributing to a few Pokemon character growth or expanding on Serena, Bonnie/Eureka, and Clemont/Citron.<br />
<br />
Overall, XY is definitely the Pokemon anime at its peak, and the one season where I actually watched every single episode for the sheer entertainment value. I recommend watching it along with its Specials, due to plot relevant information scattered throughout both.  <br />
<br />
For those of you who were disappointed with Best Wishes, XY will make things all better for you!!!<br />
<br />
(Note: This review is based on the original and not the dubs. Because the Pokemon dubs honestly went downhill with the Battle Frontier)

    This is the summit of all Pokemon series because of three things-- (1) the superb animation and design, (2) we have the best version of Ash Ketchum (3) the birth of the Mega Evolution<br />
<br />
I grew up watching Pokemon, but somewhere in my teenage years, I stopped watching it as I was calibrating my adolescence. The sooner I retrieved my interest, Pokemon XY has just finished. I could not remember that Pokemon was astounding as this as I remembered it when I was a kid. It has really improved a lot, and I realized how much I need to catch up on. <br />
<br />
The character designs are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review372061">
        great including the new sets of Pokemon in Kalos Region, and the animation, specifically during the battles, really suit my taste. Aerial Battles are best animated. Nonetheless, the story is still in the episodical pattern of storytelling. It is generic and predictable. It has no concrete plot, except that Ash is on his road towards the Kalos League.<br />
<br />
Still, the character development of the main characters is still observable. Ash&#039;s new buddies established a great chemistry. They, too, develop on their own as they pursue their individual goals together. As for Ash, I think this is the best version that we had. Ash is driven with his dreams and constant principle of not giving until it&#039;s over, characterized as composed and less comical in comparison to other series, and I gotta say he is a lot cooler in the series because of his maturity growth. Yes, Ash evolved.<br />
<br />
The slight injection of love interest is something that I also looked-forward in the series. It gave sweeter tickling spice for the older audiences of the series. This is a successful attempt in consideration that the series&#039; watchers are also growing as their interest also diversifies.<br />
<br />
More importantly, whoever formulated the Mega Evolution is a genius. The thrill of the series escalated, and the fans are amused with the amazing designs of the Mega Evolved forms of Pokemons, emphasizing the dope animation of the series. The Mega Evolution phenomenon has been a cue to audience that once activated it&#039;s like, &quot;Alright, now we&#039;re getting serious&quot;, and the battle does not fail us at all.<br />
<br />
This arc of Pokemon is indeed the peak of the series. I believe it could even compete to other animes with concrete storylines. This series is best to watch when you either want to begin watching Pokemon, because it would really be discouraging to begin from the very start, or you&#039;re a returnee watched of the series, because rest assured, it will not fail your expectations.<br />
<br />
Pokemon could be greater, and this proves it.
