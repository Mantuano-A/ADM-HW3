    Being as frank as possible, I found the Winter 2013 season to be quite weak, despite having a lot of bright and colourful ideas. The majority of them only proved to be average, slightly above even, and they definitely won&#039;t be memorable for long. Now, this talk may portray to be a little irrelevant and bias (and apologies if it is), but the point I want to get across is that I was hoping that &#039;at least&#039; one show in the season would be in a state without having to be stalled, being both enjoyable and interesting every episode and with no actual problems dragging

Thankfully there was one, and funny enough it&#039;s about a school club with absolutely no purpose or theme whatsoever. Wait, what?<br />
<br />
The anime is about... as stated earlier, nothing. Kyouya is in a club called the &#039;Good-Job Club&#039;, and their activities involve having various discussions, eating food, laying around the room being struck by lasers of heat, biting each other, lewdly brushing hair, bringing little sisters in and many more things. The other members of the club are four girls; the childish club president Mao who has a short-temper, the refined angel-like Megumi, the genius Shion lacking common sense and the mysterious cat-like Kirara.<br />
<br />
You&#039;d probably be thinking that... it sounds like a pretty generic slice of life without actually anything going on, which would naturally sound really boring to watch. To top it all of though, it sounds like a harem! There&#039;s no doubt it&#039;s harem-like with the boy:girl ratio of 1:4, and you&#039;ll probably agree that nearly all harem shows fail to be remotely good. And guess what? I found this much more interesting than all the other shows, and I&#039;m not close to devoted with slice of life shows in a school setting. So... how, and why, did I find this more entertaining than the rest of the season?<br />
<br />
Because GJ-bu does something a lot of normal slice of life shows fail to do - restraining from pushing itself to far.<br />
<br />
Or in other words, it didn&#039;t try to hard to be what it is. GJ-bu acknowledges fairly well that it&#039;s a full slice of life series with the given setting; there&#039;s no unnecessarily technical writing involved and it doesn&#039;t forces the contents or intentions of the show onto the audience in a demanding way - it just does what a slice of life is supposed to be. It really does take a slice of one&#039;s life, and converts those everyday actions into animated form. Because of this, everything feels natural, both pacing and scenery, and without having to feel boring too. None of the jokes feel dragged, and neither does the dialogue, so the conversations and spacelessness you&#039;d feel in real life are portrayed rather nicely here.<br />
<br />
But who wants to watch some guy&#039;s life in a club in the first place? Who&#039;d find that interesting? Which brings me to my second point. The natural flow in the entire show gives of a really, really lovely relaxing pace. The pacing does feel rather slow at times, but because nothing is so dragged along or forced, it makes the audience quite relaxed whilst watching each episode, and so the slowness isn&#039;t something to be weary of (well, depending on your preferences but I&#039;ll mention that later). Although the speed of the pace is noticeable when you start the series, it starts getting less obvious and time starts to fly by so swiftly you&#039;d be completely used it over the course of the series.<br />
<br />
That said, looking at a specialist&#039;s point of view, GJ-bu really isn&#039;t that unique at all. It just stands out because it does what most slice of life anime doesn&#039;t do, and that is to keep the viewers actually engaged without a plot in mind instead of building up their bore meters. The show is just about five members in a non-specified club, enjoying their time there whilst they can, so if anyone is expecting some actual plot, romance, drama, tragedy, deaths, epicness, inspiring moments and so forth, then I&#039;m afraid your expectations are at risk (though, there is a sweet semi-closure which was done really well). But if you thought that it&#039;d be a bore-pumper and something immensely non-memorable whilst choosing your seasonal shows (and, admittedly, that was me), then you should pretty much give this a go for a change of pace, and especially if you&#039;re a big fan of the slice of life genre.<br />
<br />
The animation isn&#039;t so remarkable as from the outside, but during the course of the show the art department actually does get handled as greater than what you&#039;d expect. On one hand, the budget doesn&#039;t seem so noticeable and it&#039;s understandable since it&#039;s a slice of life. The outlines of the characters can be inconsistent in terms of thickness, which is a rather rare problem in anime in general. On the other hand though, there&#039;s certain scenes where the budget goes remarkably high, in both backgrounds, atmosphere and animation (which applies to 95%+ of the last episode). Regards to the budget, there&#039;s no rubbish or quality moments in which effects the series in any way. Talking about animation, the area which it&#039;s taken in full consideration is the EDs, which used the budget pretty wildly.<br />
<br />
Well actually, scratch that. GJ-bu wins for the best ending sequence in 2013 so far. And second place. And third place...<br />
<br />
...and fourth place too. The anime consists of four ending sequences, one playing every two episodes and the fourth one playing throughout the second half of the show. Each ED is based around a certain character or two, provided with a theme; the first ED being based around the Amatsuka sisters (Mao and Megumi), the second being based on Shion, the third being Kirara&#039;s ED and the last one centered towards the entire club. The collection of EDs varies in the type of songs and mood, being from extremely high-spirited with a fast-paced rock style, to a more contemplative mood in J-Pop form. All four songs are outstandingly well-composed, being catchy and vibrant in their own ways, and the studio probably blew 90% of their budget in the EDs to make them as visually attractive and fluent as possible, even coming with a unique summer atmosphere and funky dancing. They&#039;re extremely fun to watch and I doubt you&#039;d regret having downloaded the full songs of all four endings, because I know I didn&#039;t regret it.<br />
<br />
So... in conclusion, the four EDs are the best parts in the animation and sound department, in both the entire show and the Winter season. Woops, it seems like I dedicated a whole paragraph to the GJ-bu endings, so I should start on the actual sound department now. Uh... anyway, the opening sequence plays throughout the entire show, sung by the main VA cast. It&#039;s a really catchy up-beat song, and probably not so unexpecting in a slice of life. A lot of the time the OST doesn&#039;t play, mainly for the cause of the relaxing pacing and atmosphere. The soundtrack isn&#039;t at all incredible in stand-alone, but they&#039;re very cutely composed with simple and/or retro instruments, fitting the very light mood for the show. The voice actors do a good job (haha pun) with the characters, generally fitting well in their roles. Not to mention that several of the voice actors are actually teenagers, the youngest being Kirara&#039;s VA, at the age of thirteen.<br />
<br />
Now, despite the relaxing mood and atmosphere to the plotless show, it couldn&#039;t be as interesting as it is with just the aspects I described several paragraphs ago. Of course, we can&#039;t have a club without its members!<br />
<br />
Nearly the entire cast consists of female (the male being Kyolo, the main character), and they&#039;re divided into two groups; the members of the GJ-bu, and the little sisters of those members. Let&#039;s introduce the main members the second (or third?) time, since I think it&#039;s a little necessary too; there&#039;s presisdent Mao Amatsuka, the orange one, who acts rather childish despite her rich background, and bites Kyolo when she&#039;s angry. But her younger sister is quite the opposite - Megumi Amatsuka, the pink one, is both refined and well-mannered, described almost as an angel, although it&#039;s not the case when it comes to weight. Shion Sumeragi, the purple one, is somewhat clever in lots of ways, but it seems common sense isn&#039;t her strong point. And then there&#039;s Kirara, my personal favourite member. She acts less human and more cat, structuring her sentences uniquely, and does lots of things the other members don&#039;t usually do, like eating meat all the time. And of course, we can&#039;t forget to mention Kyolo, our main man. He&#039;s presented in the series as a kind, caring and laid-back guy, though usually questioning whatever actions the other members perform (and usually on him too).<br />
<br />
Oh and there&#039;s the green one. She doesn&#039;t appear in the beginning though.<br />
<br />
All of the members are, firstly to say, stand-alone in their own way. You get a variety of personalities (and hair colours), and each have their own qualities for themselves in which both benefits and non-benefits them. However, it&#039;s the way they&#039;re presented that fleshes out the personalities further - The features of each individual becomes clearer and fresher with certain tropes and actions happening on-screen. Basically, the characters are in a club room, talking and in different ways interacting with each other. Whether it&#039;s conversations or actions, each individual would perform any kind of action which adds up as the evidence of one of the features in the characters, and it fleshes out into the characterization of the members (some of those actions may reveal one of the tropes at first shot though, depending on how obvious the feature is). In other words, characterization happens in the course of events, rather than having them explained, which feels both natural and less lazy.<br />
<br />
The more fun thing about this though is that each of the characters has quite distinct personalities and different features, fears, knowledge, preferences and so on compared to each other, so it&#039;s pretty fun seeing them hang round together as a group. You get a lot of times when they all agree to tease Kyolo in the most entertaining way for them to watch, and then scenes where they all take their turns to do a certain activity, from having their hair brushed, to arm-wrestling, to guessing whatever picture Kyolo drew and so on. There&#039;s no real hatred, drama and problems going around in the GJ-bu, so it&#039;s hard to start hating a character in the series, though of course it&#039;s not the case for everyone. Also, need to mention development. Well, there isn&#039;t much development since the anime starts during the middle course of Kyolo&#039;s time being in the club, but he does get a well-hidden development in the entire series, to both towards the other members and personality. It&#039;s just not so easy to notice and stretched out.<br />
<br />
Did I enjoy GJ-bu? Considering that the entire show felt really natural and relaxing, and seeing each characters with different kinds of features interact with each other and Kyolo, of course I did. I had a really hard time debating whether or not to rate GJ-bu a solid 7 or a low 8, but it seemed like it was the latter (though honestly, I still can&#039;t decide). For anyone who just regarded this as some moe anime with really bland episodes might want to give this a second thought; this was the only show I started in the season which I didn&#039;t decide upon my full plan for the season, and it turned out it was the only show I actually thoroughly enjoyed in the entire show. If it wasn&#039;t for my brother I would&#039;ve never encountered this gem, so it was lucky I didn&#039;t pass on this. GJ-bu was a enjoyable and relaxing ride for me, and it seems like I&#039;ve grown fond to the series more than I expected to be.<br />
<br />
I just wish that more school slice of life anime was like GJ-bu.

    I love the art design in this , the way they drew the character is the type of anime drawings i love to watch<br />
<br />
The Story is pretty much a slice of life but it has no main plot<br />
<br />
Sound is High quality and great from where i watch it<br />
<br />
Characters are funny and some are cute<br />
<br />
I enjoy this a lot and i would recommend anyone this for laughter and enjoyment <br />

    Personally, I find this anime, basically, a cute, simple, slice-of-life anime. It reminds me a lot of several other slice-of-life anime like Lucky Star, Working!! or Acchi Kocchi. Why? Well it&#039;s mostly because GJ-Bu doesn&#039;t seem to have a real plot of its own.<br />
<br />
 But despite that, I find it entertaining. Sure, there&#039;s no story behind it. But seeing Kyoya and the stuff that happens with the girls in the club room? I can&#039;t help but smile while watching it.<br />
<br />
The art is bright and colorful. The anime screams a rainbow of colors, which is a good thing. It&#039;s also clear and the animation flows rather

          <span style="display: none;" id="review87435">
        smoothly. <br />
<br />
I personally like the characters. Though, Mao reminds me (in a way) of Aisaka Taiga from Toradora. But all the characters can easily be described as &quot;Kawaii.&quot; Maybe that&#039;s a personal opinion, but I&#039;m sure a lot think that way. <br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really see anything to dislike this anime for. Maybe I missed a few things, but small things won&#039;t stop me from watching good anime.<br />
<br />
This series is still airing, so there&#039;s more to be expected. I don&#039;t know where this anime will lead to-- but for now I&#039;ll give it an 8/10

    GJ-bu is part of a sub-genre of slice of life which encompasses K-On, Yuru Yuri and others. These shows spend most of their times showing characters on a club usually doing absolutely nothing, whether because they skip club activities or because the club activities have no real purpose. They are usually hard to review due to few complexity in plot and characters, but it&#039;s not like it&#039;s non-existent. GJ-bu, however, takes this to extreme measures.<br />
<br />
Now, before you argue that the quality of the story is irrelevant, consider the following. If GJ-bu wants to show cute girls (and a boy, though on the verge of being

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93305">
        considered a girl as well) doing nothing but random stuff, then first it must get the viewer to actually care about the girls, otherwise it&#039;s just irritating rather than endearing. That&#039;s what good storytelling does, by offering a bridge between the world, including its characters, and the viewer. The problem is... this show doesn&#039;t have good storytelling.<br />
<br />
While most shows at least try to construct a basic conceptual setting for the story to take place, this one decides it doesn&#039;t need to. Instead, we are thrown into the middle of an unknown place, with anonymous faces doing strange things we don&#039;t understand. Who are they? What are they trying to achieve? How do they relate with each other? There are many other questions, but these are the least you have to answer to convince the viewer that your characters are humans and not moeblobs walking around. GJ-bu&#039;s characterization is done through a few dialogues there and here and a few, very few, scenes outside the club. That&#039;s all you get.<br />
<br />
Maybe the story just wasn&#039;t well executed, but the characters could still be good, right? Indeed, conceptually it&#039;s possible to elaborate interesting characters, but fail to fulfill their potential in practice. That&#039;s not the case of GJ-bu, which defines its characters in terms of clichéd stereotypes and refuses to give them any further depth. It&#039;s not that they lack back-story or psychological investigation, they just weren&#039;t meant to have any complexity to start with.<br />
<br />
One-dimensional characters can be done well as long as they remain entertaining and/or charismatic, but to do so they must have interesting features and interactions with other characters. Characters from GJ-bu just do the same things over and over again, taking for granted the viewer&#039;s interest because of the cute and silly things going on. There&#039;s pretty much nothing fresh about the scenes, since they revolve around stereotypes doing their things.<br />
<br />
As one would expect, if the storytelling is bad and the characters are poor, the jokes aren&#039;t exactly a masterpiece of humor, specially because they rely heavily on the characters. Shion, for instance, is very knowledgeable about many topics, but lacks common sense, as the stereotyped genius she is. That&#039;s it, there goes about 90% of all jokes about her, and not particularly creative ones. Oh, eventually she reveals that she would like to have a younger sister and has Tama fulfill that role because it&#039;s cute.<br />
<br />
Yes, &quot;because it&#039;s cute&quot; and &quot;because the public&#039;s desires must be satisfied&quot; seem to be the main driving factors for GJ-bu. You&#039;ve got tsunderes, maids, all kinds of hair colors, cat ears, little sisters, foreigners, heck, there&#039;s even cross-dressing for the girls and Kyoro. Everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer through a specific stimulation. If the show had used at least half of the time spent on this planning towards making the characters and their context actually interesting, a great deal of its problems would have simply disappeared.<br />
<br />
Now that we&#039;ve got the bad things out of the way, let&#039;s focus on the bright side. Since visual appeal is relevant to GJ-bu&#039;s purposes, it tries to build its own style, as colorful, cute and comfortable as possible. These efforts are mostly successful, but the character designs are easily forgettable, nothing you haven&#039;t seen in other moe shows, and the animation is only average. As for the soundtrack, it&#039;s pretty catchy, and a lot of effort is put into the ending&#039;s themes... still, they end up sounding quite generic as well. As a whole, though, the production values are all right.<br />
<br />
Now, after all of this, it could be concluded that this show is lame and boring, incapable of doing anything remarkable on its own. Well, there&#039;s nothing remarkable for sure, but surprisingly, it&#039;s still enjoyable. That&#039;s the ultimate secret of GJ-bu: it knows what it&#039;s doing. It was previously said that everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer, and this becomes evident as the show goes on.<br />
<br />
GJ-bu&#039;s focus on quantity rather than quality may lose points in artistic and creative value, but it&#039;s an important trade-off. You don&#039;t like this girl? Oh, then have another, and another, and another, all with distinct specifications, until you have one that you like. The stereotyped personalities are very helpful because otherwise it would be difficult to do this. Real people have common mindsets and physical attributes due to sharing the same environment, many have similar goals and ideologies, are constantly changing or trying to change, show different sides of themselves depending on the context... Stereotypes, on the other hand, are static, simple, and make sure that two characters will be as different as possible.<br />
<br />
But surely there must be at least one grumpy old man who isn&#039;t charmed by any of the show&#039;s attempts, right? No problem. It may sound crazy, but GJ-bu doesn&#039;t deliver enjoyment solely from the viewer&#039;s love; hate is also effective. The series tries so hard to be cute and funny with its endless list of clichés, shallow characters and situations, fetishes and repetitive jokes that it turns into a laughable parody of itself for those who are not amused and become increasingly cynical. For example, the fact that the maid spins around every time she appears may either be seen as endearing or a pathetic attempt at being endearing. Both are acceptable, because GJ-bu doesn&#039;t care if it&#039;s being loved or hated, as long as it&#039;s not being ignored.<br />
<br />
GJ-bu is, quite literally, an anime for everyone. It has generic written all over it, but you end up either loving or hating it because it goes so overboard in applying all sorts of tested formulas. Truth be told, if you are a fan of this kind of series, has no problems with underdeveloped characters and poor storytelling, and want something with a sort of relaxed atmosphere and all types of cuteness, then try GJ-bu, as it probably won&#039;t disappoint. Otherwise, it&#039;s not advised to take the risk, but the show could be good for a few laughs; if not genuine, then mocking.

    &quot;Slice of life anime have always interested me.Watching some random anime characters doing their everyday chores and spending their life carelessly reminds me of my own life.The life which is spent in search of those small moments of happiness.It remind me of me having fun with my friends and family.There are sad times too but there are other happy moments as well.After all,life is not completely about joy and pleasure.We have to bear sadness as<br />
well&quot;....So,before u get bored by my life lecture(which u are sure being,T.T),I better start my review which is about an hidden gem i.e. Gj-bu or in other words &quot;Good Job&quot;<br />
<br />
Gj-bu huh,...where

          <span style="display: none;" id="review91401">
        to begin..When I first started watching,I didn&#039;t pay much attention to it.I didn&#039;t expect it to become THIS awesome as I was like&quot;Yeah,it is good..but there are other awesome anime too..&quot;But I was wrong.As i watched more,I got engrossed in it to a point that I began to wait for it every week unknowingly.After watching the last episode,I just couldn&#039;t take it as I realized that &quot;Man,I am in love with it.&quot;So I decided to write a review for this so that other people who are looking for some fun anime may give it a try.<br />
<br />
Story:-(8/10)<br />
<br />
First of all..about story..there is none...Well it is a slice of life anime,not much to expect in this department.After all,slice of anime are not about story,they are more about characters,fun,comedy and about creating an carefree environment in which a person can relax.They give us a hint of our everyday life in which this anime surely succeeds.I can this say this confidently that this will make you laugh a lot and you will grin in front of your computer(or laptop:P) screen countless times.<br />
<br />
The story is about a NORMAL high-school boy who gets recruited in a random club in which there are no prominent club activities..They just relax,play around,get warmed up in kotatsu(when it is winter of-course),drink tea(a lot...),eat cakes etc etc.In other words,a dream-like club(I want a club like that,T.T).<br />
<br />
Story wise,it reminds me of Seitokai no Ichizon and Sket Dance which,just like it,are anime about everyday life of their respective characters.Above all,it is very natural.It is not artificial.There are some shows which try too hard to make their audience laugh but that is not the case here.There is a flow in dialogues of the characters and a person laughs even when he don&#039;t want to.<br />
<br />
So,I give it a solid 8 score out of 10:)The only reason I cut marks is that this is a <br />
slice-of-life anime and marks are bound to cut in such a kind of anime.<br />
<br />
Art:-(9/10)<br />
<br />
The art is just simply great.It is elegant,vibrant and colorful just the way I like.You can see the detail in everything.The backgrounds are also beautifully done.The best thing is that,art&#039;s quality remains constantly goodt.It is not like one episode has great art but in the next episode,the quality drops,no...It remains same throughout the series which is one of those lovable points of this series.<br />
<br />
The character designs may bug some people on their first try at this anime(it bugged me for sure) but as u get used to it,it gets better until you start to love those.It is quite unique but once you get a hang of it,it becomes pleasant to look at.So....I give it a mega-solid 9 points for its beautiful and colorful art:P<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound:-(9/10)<br />
<br />
Now,Even,in sound department,this anime shines as much as in others.When I first heard the opening song,I was like is it really a song?I mean it begins very randomly but as I listened it more as new episodes aired,I totally fell in love with it.It is so catchy and upbeat,totally the genre I like.<br />
<br />
The ending song changes  after 2-3 episodes so as to give each female lead,her own song.I love each and all of them but due to them being not used more than 2-3 times(except the last one,in which all the famale leads sing together),they are sadly not as memorable as they CAN be which is a slightly weak point of this series.<br />
<br />
Now,voice-acting...is SUPERB as well.I just love Shion,Kirara,Mao&#039;s,Megumi&#039;s(and lol everyone&#039;s) voice..(Seriously speaking)I<br />
love megu&#039;s voice the most.They have done a fantastic job so kudos to them.About the bgm...is it important in a slice-of-life?I don&#039;t think so..but it is still good.<br />
<br />
So that&#039;s why,I give it,a mega-solid 9 points here as well for  lovable voice-acting by seiyuus and for OP and ED songs.<br />
<br />
Characters:-(10/10)<br />
<br />
Now finally the department where it shines truly...the character are lovable..I love all the characters.The only complaint I have that the imoutos don&#039;t get as much screen-time as they should get as they are so lovable.<br />
<br />
Mao-chan..is the bubbly and mischievious club buuchou or in other words,club president(uhum,my translating abilities:P).She is short,has curly hair and is conscious of her short height.Well,she sure has it rough as she is called to be in elementary school by some people.She acts bossy but in truth likes the main lead very much so she gets shy easily but hate to show her shyness so that&#039;s why she acts bossy(there is a whole cycle man,T.T)<br />
<br />
Megumi is Mao&#039;s younger sister(but looks older..ahem).She is a sweet and kind-hearted girl who loves to make cakes and....make others drink a lot of tea especially our main male lead Kyoya or Kyoro(as called by club members)I don&#039;t like anime characters who are like her usually but she has a special magnet that attracts me to her I.She is super-conscious about her weight(both sisters have some thing to be conscious about,T.T), a pretty cute point of hers.<br />
<br />
Shion,is a GENIUS!!... but lacks common-sense which is her MOE-KYUN point(:P)She has a lot of brothers who are as intelligent as her,each excelling in at least one field.She gets pampered a lot as one of her brother makes her lunch,dinner etc while other makes special kind of coffee for her etc,so she wants to eat things like hamburger etc.and drink things like canned coffee etc.She is pretty and lovable.<br />
<br />
Kirara is the tigress of group(well she behaves like a cat and sometimes tigress) who loves to eat meat so she is sometimes forced to eat veggies by her younger sister which she eats...raw!(really)The meat which she eats..is a special kind of meat which only Kyoro has eaten.She speaks in very short sentences but can,surprisingly speak like a normal girl through cell-phones which is her super-cute point.<br />
<br />
Kyoro,is our main lead who is super lucky to be in part of this harem..I mean who wouldn&#039;t wants to be there with all those amazing girls.He is very surprisingly beautiful as when he cosplays,he becomes a bishoujo,club members fear his this ability.Thats not all,he can transform into ORE-MAN.During this transformation,he gets Extra-Masculine,a fact due to which he is loved by fellow club members.His last skill is that he is super-good at hair-brushing which can <br />
make any girl MOE-KYUN.So all in all,he is a nice lead as he develops nicely throughout the series by acquiring his...fearsome skills...<br />
<br />
There are other nice characters too.Tamaki is a newly recruited or more like...abducted girl who eats a lot and amazingly does not become..fatter.The imoutos(or in other words,sisters.Again my translating abilities,huhu) group which consist of Kyoro,Megu and Mao&#039;s and Kirara&#039;s sisters.The have a Gj-bu at their school as well.Who can forget the strongest women of the entire world i.e. Mori who is a maid at Megu &amp; Mao&#039;s house.When she does that maid twirl as requested by Kyoro,I bet your heat will skip a beat.She does not age..and has a daughter just like her,a mystery that has not be solved ever.In a nutshell.I totally love the characters which you may have guessed by now(:P)This department is done splendidly sooo a giga-solid 10/10 from me:D<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall(9/10):-<br />
<br />
I loveee it!This is an amazing series as it gets you on a ride full of fun and enjoyment.I laughed a lot and at end I got  teary(sob sob)After completing it,I just want to say&quot;Good Job&quot; to the studio which has done it(dogakobo is its name,i think..)Now for recommendation..I don&#039;t recommend it to those people who watch series based on its story as there is not much here.Contrary to it,I totally recommend it to people who,just like me,love to see those cute,slice-of-life sort of anime.If u are one of these,then go man(or woman,:P),watch it as u are missing a hidden gem which u may want to add in your anime list.So,what u are waiting for,watch it now.I promise that you won&#039;t be <br />
disappointed(:D)<br />

    There is one word I hate to use to describe stuff, and that is boring. I mean, that&#039;s such a generic word. When something is boring, that just means that you couldn&#039;t get into it, as even bad shows aren&#039;t boring, they&#039;re just, well, bad. All bad shows aren&#039;t boring, but all shows that someone says are boring, they typically see that as a bad show. And no matter how much I hate to use that word, I cannot deny the word boring is a perfect word that sums up GJ-bu. <br />
GJ-bu is based off of a “4-panel light novel” (aka, a collection of short

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106145">
        4 page stories) written by Araki Shin, who has done nothing else of note. It tells the story of a certain boy (Kyoya) who was apparently forced to join the Good Job Club, or the GJ-bu. This is a club who&#039;s purpose they never tell us, as most of the times they just sit around and do nothing. <br />
<br />
And I mean nothing. Literally the whole show,one short scene at Kyoro&#039;s house, oh, and a small part at the cafe, happens inside that damn room .In a way it&#039;s like K-On, where all they do is eat and talk, but at least K-On pretended to have a story. GJ-bu just goes from skit to skit to skit. One skit they&#039;re combing hair, the next skit they&#039;re dressing up in swimsuits (yes, the beach episode doesn&#039;t even take place at a beach),  then they play doctor, then they look at Kyoya&#039;s sketchbook, and then they comb hair some more (every girl seems to get their hair combed in this show somewhere by the way). Sure they are a few connections and running gags, but most of those are not very entertaining and original (oh, the maid likes to spin! Mao is short and gets pissed a lot! The rich person doesn&#039;t know how to eat cup noodles! HAHAHA!). And everything about this show is not entertaining. It just abuses the characters&#039; main traits over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s take a look at them, shall we? They tried to make Kyoro the only sane man, which might have been nice, but his voice has no emotion at all in it and sounds so bored, and being the only sane man, his goal is mainly to comment on how absurd each situation is. He&#039;s the only boy in this show, making it a harem by definition, and it&#039;s true he does seem to go from girl to girl to talk, most obvious in the last episode. Then there&#039;s Mao, the tsundere, who is of course short. There&#039;s also Shion, the calm smart girl, Megumi, the calm reliable girl, and there&#039;s Kirara. She eats a lot, and due to the fact she&#039;s originally from Canada she speaks in fragmented Japanese, and not very often in the first place. There&#039;s also a green-haired girl thrown in about halfway through, but they barely show her anyway. She&#039;s just basically another tsundere though, so yeah. Two tsunderes and two calm girls. How entertaining.  There&#039;s also a maid, and three sisters that belong to random members of the cast. Those don&#039;t appear much though, and the only one that is okay is Kirara&#039;s sister, who can only speak in (bad) English but can write perfect Japanese on a white board. Which does make a little sense considering she could&#039;ve just picked up kanji or something, but still.<br />
<br />
The voices were rather annoying and tried to hard to just be the cliché the character was and nothing more. On the music, I don&#039;t recall any from the show itself, but on the opening and ending themes... The opening starts out really neat with this cool rap... But then they start singing in these emotionless off-tune voices, and yeah, it sounds really bad. They are four ending themes for some reason, with varying degrees of how good those are (ending 1and 3 are bad, ending 2 is actually really neat sounding and 4 is decent enough I suppose).<br />
<br />
The animation however was rather bad. The character designs weren&#039;t best to begin with, but at random times you could see thick black lines around them, which never looks pretty. And it seems the amount they move gets worse and worse every episode. They must of wasted too much money early on or something. <br />
<br />
I think GJ-bu might of worked as one of those 3 minute episode anime, but with full length episodes, it just gets boring so fast. I have seen a good amount of slice-of-life anime, and GJ-bu might be the worst one I&#039;ve seen, with Kill Me Baby as its only true rival. If you enjoy the characters more than I do, then it&#039;s worth a watch, but I can&#039;t recommend this to anyone else.

    Slice of life is always a very interesting genre, that can be portrayed in a majority of ways, considering the fact that life can be swayed into various situations and lifestyles.  We have the wonderful Anohana that depicts a more serious and tragic story on one hand, and we have Lucky Star one of the most well known slice of life&#039;s to date, featuring the daily live of 4 girls.  And, we have Gj-bu, an anime, that is, what I refer to as, a little ball of fun.<br />
<br />
Story (7/10): Speaking of Lucky Star, this anime Gj-bu, has an immense similarity to it. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review130503">
        The story of Gj-bu is nothing special or new in the anime world.  To put it simply, it&#039;s about the daily &quot;club activities&quot; of the Gj club, a club that apparently, everyone in the school avoids for some odd reason.  The characters generally spend most of their time in their little club room world, and rarely leave the godforsaken place.  Not that that&#039;s wrong, but personally, I would like for them to leave the clubroom for at least a few minutes more, considering the fact that the total amount of screen time that was outside of the clubroom, doesn&#039;t even equate to the length of a single episode.  <br />
<br />
While the amount of screen time outside the clubroom does show a little bit of lost potential, what goes on in the club room makes it up for it, tenfold.  Because the show is heavily relying on the character interactions, and it excels at it at that, there&#039;s no need for them to really leave in the first place.  The comedy that this show is probably known for, is created and harvested from their activities and random acts of wackiness, and therefore, we have this formula of (characters + activity = comedy) which turns out to work out VERY well for this anime.  While I won&#039;t say that this anime deserves any plot originality by any means, Gj-bu is pretty damn enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Characters (9/10): Characters are where slice of life&#039;s really shine in.  This particular anime shines extremely brightly on the slice of life spectrum in the character category.  While the troupes of characters aren&#039;t necessarily original, (weight complex, very smart with low common sense, short tsundere) the anime does well in trying to set them apart from their normal roots.  <br />
<br />
First, Kyoya, or Kyoro as he&#039;s more known for.  As literally the only guy to exist in this anime, (there&#039;s seriously no one else), I find him as a rather amusing character.  He plays off at first as one of those, &quot;what am I doing here?&quot; characters, but slowly becomes accustomed to his situation, and having fun with what he&#039;s doing in his spare time.  Now, I should mention that this guy is the butt of all jokes.  All of the characters tease him, he&#039;s the one getting abused the most, and you gotta hand it to him for enduring 2 years of pain from 4-5 girls.  <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the Gj club, we have a bramble of girls (not a harem...I think.)  Megumi, Shion, Kirara, and the ever so wonderful and terrifying, Mao.  And later, Tamaki.  While usually I dislike anime troupes due to their overuse and unoriginality, I really do like these characters.  Though they are based on something we&#039;ve all seen before, they all have a very unique twist that adds in to the whole atmosphere to the show.  While no, I cannot explain what those twists are, I found all of these characters quite funny and extremely likable.  <br />
<br />
The side characters also get a round of applause for this anime, specifically because of how good they are, in supporting character standards.  While yes, I did have a problem with them appearing in so late in the series, I didn&#039;t really mind them that much considering how much they all added to the show.  They were just as entertaining, and I found myself laughing a lot.  Overall, these characters are extremely likable, and VERY funny.  (There&#039;s 4 little sisters total.  5 if you want to include Tamaki.)  <br />
<br />
Art and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art in this anime is a very interesting mix.  On one hand, we have the normal animation, which is this really strange half-chibi mix where the characters sort of look chibi, but they&#039;re not.  The other one is a straight up chibi art style that makes everyone a chibi.  Kind of weird considering that there are scenes where the tallest person in the room, and the shortest person in the room are the same height due to chibi logic.  Regardless, the animation does work really well for this anime, adding more to its comedic aspect, making it more joyful and overall, really fun to watch.  It has very light colors and a decent looking background, as well as distinct hair colors for every character so you know exactly who is who.  <br />
<br />
The sound is your typical fast-paced music.  The OP is very catchy and fast, with a skippy beat that makes it easy to sort of dance along to.  The ED&#039;s vary from episode to episode, and all have their own distinct feel on every one of them.  There&#039;s also some pretty good piano tracks and some good sad music as well.  While the soundtrack is pretty decent, it&#039;s still your usual slice of life upbeat soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment (9/10): Whenever I watch anime of a repeated/overdone genre, I always try to find something that&#039;s different than the rest of the anime in that category.  If not, I dump it.  Gj-bu surprised me greatly because of just how addicting and cute the characters were as I was watching it.  It has this really unique touch to the typical slice of life that I cannot explain, which probably makes it why I enjoy this anime so much.  I laughed a great deal while watching it, and enjoyed every last ridiculous moment.  I wouldn&#039;t say this isn&#039;t the best slice of life&#039;s out there, (Clannad Afterstory takes that position in my opinion), but it is very fun to watch, and a fun way to kill time.  While sadly, this anime does not get a season 2, I still enjoyed it to the fullest, and promised to rewatch it any time I want to.  The characters were great, the art was pretty good, the soundtrack and story were done before, but I would highly suggest it to anyone who loves a good and fun little series.<br />
<br />
Overall score: 8.05

    This anime is not my type, really. It has absolutely no plot line or development. It is purely a slice of life anime. However, in spite of myself, I enjoyed the anime quite a bit. It proved to be entertaining and had some good laughs in it. All in all, if you aren&#039;t obsessed with any other anime right now, and don&#039;t have any you REAAALLY want to start, this is a great anime to kill some time with.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
I gave it a 5, because, well, there was none really. Just the base: A high schooler gets forced to join an all-girl club that really has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93643">
        no honest purpose. The club is just a hangout, really.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art in this anime is very unique. The wide, bright color palette keeps a cheery &quot;background mood&quot; throughout.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
There wasn&#039;t really anything in the sound that stood out to me. But it fit in with the action just fine.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
I liked most of the characters. Each one had a set, defined, and unique personality. But, none of the characters changed through the entire anime, with the exception of a couple slight changes to Kyouya&#039;s and Mao&#039;s personality, mostly because Kyouya gets used to being there and more comfortable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
This is really the only reason to watch the anime, and the artwork is a plus. You should get a few good laughs out of this anime, and the interactions between the members are quite charming.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
Overall, the anime provides some nice enjoyment and relaxation. But unless you have some extra time to kill, or really need a break from all the action and complex plots, there&#039;s not much else reason to watch it.

    This story was adorable, which is fine for me but not for others. I found myself loving the characters without realizing it, so much so that when it ending i was crying not because of a really sad ending or anything, just because it was ending. If you watch this expect nothing but comedy really, and not even great jokes but something that could put a smile on your face.

    First off, let me say that I am very light on anime, as I generally really like anime that others don&#039;t like so much (Basically, if I watched it I really liked it, with few exceptions) , so this review should be taken with a grain of salt<br />
<br />
Characters: GJ-Bu was overall pretty good, but it had so much potential, especially the characters (Like Kasumi), which the never-progressing style of the show did nothing for (Kasumi needed more air time!).<br />
It has a lot of good characters (Kasumi) and several of them more than deserved true development beyond forming their personalities and quirks. In short, the only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review147411">
        thing this show is missing is true story development (Well, and more Kasumi), which is kind of what this type of show does, so I forgive that. Even the characters you don&#039;t particularly like you can&#039;t help but not hate. They all have good qualities and give something to the show, whether it&#039;s mostly comedy, or mostly cute moments, not of them are just there as glue to keep the show together.<br />
<br />
Sound&amp;Art: The art and sound are nothing special in particular, but they are nice, and the style of art suits the genre of show, so there won&#039;t be any of that &quot;This is a good show, but the art isn&#039;t quite right...&quot; feeling you can get from some anime. (In short, Kasumi Kawaii!!!)<br />
<br />
Setting: The show takes place almost exclusively in one room, but unlike many shows that do this, it&#039;s not EXCLUSIVELY in one room. The characters are occasionally seen in different places (For example, Kasumi is seen out on the street, and reading in her brother&#039;s room). This helps you to get the feeling of the club atmosphere because you&#039;re there so often, but not to feel like the show is trapped or that it is being &quot;acted out&quot; by the characters. It feels natural to be in that room because it&#039;s not constant, but you still always get carried back (I want to carry Kasumi back...).<br />
<br />
Personal Feelings (Rant): This show was very good, but I can&#039;t help but feel like I missed out on a masterpiece. GJ-Bu had so much potential that it hurts to see it stand where it is. If there was more development in the story, and it focused more on the protagonist and his relationships with the heroines, then this show could have easily been rated a ten. In particular if the protagonist, Kyoro, and the apparent main heroine, Mao, had developed some sort of serious relationship during the show, and if Kasumi was more than a short appearance every once and a while, this show would be through the roof. Mao is where I feel really disappointed in the show because she is such a great character and had so much potential, but was seemingly given the &quot;Never growing, never changing&quot; curse by the writer. Mao could have easily been the best heroine of the year, but the type of show didn&#039;t allow for it. All I can hope is that some fan of the show or novels creates a doujin to give the characters the story they deserve, and that I can find it...quickly.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading through my rant...

    This anime is very moe. If you like moe anime this one is absolutely perfect for you. It&#039;s the classic slice of life anime that has several adorable girls, each with their own unique little quirks, and a single guy that gets caught up in a lot of things they do. There&#039;s a lot of classic stereotypes in here like the tsundere or little sister in love with her brother stuff in here as well. Basically, if you&#039;re looking for something refreshing and different, this anime is probably not for you. But if you just want something classic, cute, and enjoyable at a leisurely pace,

    Gj-Bu or Gj Club depending on how you prefer the name, is a very true to it&#039;s nature type of schooltime/harem series. <br />
<br />
You have the typical girls of tsundere, lolicon and other typical anime stereotypical characters, that have been used again and again. But somehow Gj-Bu does it in a very refreshing way to the genre. <br />
<br />
They haven&#039;t really improved the characters beyond their genre, but they made them less, well, re-used. It&#039;s kinda like they took all the over used material, polished it hard, and made it revive like a phoenix. <br />
<br />
Because I am really enjoying Gj-bu for all it&#039;s already used material, because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review90295">
        it makes you fall in love with the quirkiness of all the stereotypes all over. <br />
<br />
You fall especially hard for Mao-chans overly tsundere way of acting, and her lolicon appearence. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not up there in my all time greats, but it&#039;s sure is close. <br />
<br />
Recommended.

    I really really REALLY loved this anime. I looked forward to it every week because I knew that the new episode would brighten up my week and make it 10x better. It&#039;s such a cute and funny anime that I don&#039;t think i&#039;ve seen one as good. I honestly do hope that they make a new series even if it&#039;s completely done off the novel. Yes Mao, Kirara, and Shion have graduated, but that leaves their little sisters to fill in their spots. Of course they could never take their places, but it would diffidently add alot of humor. I give this a 10/10 hands

    This show pulled me in with the art. Its light and pretty and all the reviews seem to be surprisingly high. So i thought I&#039;d give it a shot. The first episode didn&#039;t land for me so I kept watching and watching until I had finished the entire series.<br />
I felt like I had wasted my time with this one. Its like a dumbed down version of every Slice Of Life anime out there. Nothing really happens, there&#039;s no conflict, character development,obstacles or anything. This in itself is fine. but paired with the fact that these characters are so boring it just makes for 12 episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301773">
        of the same story told other ways. like every other Slice Of Life, its a pseudo harem with the brown haired inexperienced boy in an after school club filled with girls who have no reason to be drooling over categorized as a loser. buuuttt what ever. <br />
A lot of the moments meant to be funny in this anime just aren&#039;t. We see multiple times (basically once an episode) the pink haired girl being the butt end to a fat joke. Thing is, shes not fat. But this is still the topic of discussion every single time. Most comments are weirdly sexist and it never just makes you laugh. There&#039;s no comic release relief or anything past a half baked characters who fill the anime stereotype.<br />
It just sucks, with such pretty art I really hoped the anime would&#039;ve just been better, when it simply wasn&#039;t.

    Story: Well how do i start this.. Gj bu is a wonderful anime to watch. Its very short so ill try to explain as much as i can without spoiling the whole story. It basically takes place in a highschool club called the GJ club. I dont know how to spell any of the names so ill call them by there nicknames. It centers around a second year highschool boy named Kyoya. He gets into this club with a bunch of girls. The GJ club is supposed to be a club that endures challenges and festives.<br />
I think its a wonderful story. It really connects you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review106009">
        with all of the characters and its one of those animes where you feel sorry that its ending. I wish they would make a second season. <br />
<br />
Art: The art is basically the same as you would see in any of these highschool based animes so i dont have much to say. <br />
<br />
Sound: ALL OF THE GIRLS ARE KAWAII SOUNDING

    “Lord, what fools these mortals be!” <br />
― William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream<br />
<br />
You&#039;re probably wondering why I used that quote at the start of this review, as it&#039;s completely random. But that&#039;s the best way to sum up this anime, completely random. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s very hard to write this review, as there isn&#039;t much really to comment on. It&#039;s a 12 episode comedy/slice of life with 1 OVA and has few flaws, but in my opinion is worth the watch. In this review, I will tell you why I believe this.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d also like to start by saying that this anime has little romance, and no harem

          <span style="display: none;" id="review156403">
        in it. So if you wanted that kind of thing, I don&#039;t suggest this anime. <br />
<br />
*This review will contain no major spoilers (There isn&#039;t much to spoil, as there is no plot line)*<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
To put it plain and simply, there isn&#039;t one. It&#039;s about a group of friends having fun and doing crazy things in their clubroom, it&#039;s hard to comment over this because it has not plot line, and I recon you could watch the anime out of order and it would still make some sense. It shows high-school kids doing the unthinkable. The Slice of Life genre seems to be popular, so for those liking this genre along with comedy and you enjoyed animes like Lucky Star, this is a must watch.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The art really was one of the animes strong points. In my opinion, the art was great. They used Chibi characters along with normal ones to emphasise a characters anger and frustration in that given moment. I loved the use of bright colors, and believed it gave the anime a much lighter look as it should have when dealing with this genre.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
<br />
I personally liked the soundtrack, nothing more to it.<br />
<br />
Charecter: 8<br />
<br />
All the characters where different in many ways. Trying not to spoil it here but for instance, Shion. She is a genius, and your typical know it all. But when it comes to common sense, she lacks in some areas. Kind of relating to animes such as The Pet Girl Of Sakurasou, this makes for a funny and entertaining character. Every character is relatable to, (Except Kirara. If you can relate to Kirara, go see a doctor) and they all make the series more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
This anime was made to enjoy. I believe that this was a well executed anime, using the slice of life genre and comedy made it all the better. <br />
<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
I can understand why this anime gets hate. This anime is not for everyone and anyone, it&#039;s one of those animes that you either love or hate. I loved it, it was flawed, had no character development and no plot line or goal, but it was enjoyable and helped me take a break from all the normal, more depressing and sad anime I sometimes watch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my review c; It&#039;s only my second one, so sorry if you don&#039;t think it&#039;s at a very high standard q.q

    I have referred to GJ-bu as a great deal many things - a far better show than it had any right to be, the most solidly 7.5/10 show ever created, the anime equivalent of listening to a Matchbox Twenty song five times in a row on repeat - but what&#039;s most important to know going in is that this is not just a generic harem anime. It is THE generic harem anime.  If you have ever watched a harem slice-of-life and thought, &quot;Wow, I want more of that show,&quot; then you&#039;re in luck because this show is basically just a single serving of &#039;more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review211540">
        of that.&#039;<br />
<br />
Do you want to know the plot of GJ-bu? There is no plot to GJ-bu. A boy is in a club that does nothing with a bunch of cute girls, and together, they have wacky shenanigans. That is all the plot there is. The very first scene is a silly skit, before you even know the character&#039;s names. This show does not waste time. If I had to summarize the experience of GJ-bu in one sentence, I would tell you that, in GJ-bu, there is a beach episode in which they never leave the changing room. It knows what you&#039;re here for, and it delivers it, streamlined.<br />
<br />
Being nothing you haven&#039;t seen before doesn&#039;t a good show make on its own - in fact, that&#039;s almost entirely a negative more often than not - and GJ-bu knows that as well. The one thing this show excels in above all else is the little touches. This show is basically a love letter to every harem anime that came before it, and as such, all of its aping and classic gags come with that added degree of heart. It&#039;s sincere, more than anything, which is what bumps this up from a 7 to and 8 in my book.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are able to tread the fine line between being wacky caricatures and relatable people like its nothing. The designs can be a little off-putting at first, with the technicolor hairstyles and sharp outlines, but it grows on you really quickly once it&#039;s all in motion, thanks to the talents of the animators at Doga Kobo. They&#039;re silly and cliche&#039;d when they need to be for a joke, but there are plenty of slow, character-driven moments that exist only to give them just that tiniest little bit of necessary depth rather than aim for pure comedy all the time. The time spent giving them actual tangible personality really pays off by the time you finish the final episode, which is a marvelous send-off to everything the series had built up so far. The intention of these characters is not just to make you laugh - it&#039;s to make sure you miss them once it&#039;s all over.<br />
<br />
Outside of the actual plot itself (or lack thereof), perhaps the single greatest part of the entire show is the animation and music for the ending credits themes. There are four total ending credits themes over the course of the twelve episodes - two episodes each for the first three and six for the final - and they are all nice in their own ways, with some of them even being spectacular. The first one is cute, the second one is astounding (featuring the always impressive vocals of Suzuko Mimori), the third is feverish and dance-inducing as all get-out, and the fourth is an endearing reminder of the way these characters get along together and only serves to underline the show&#039;s entire purpose. They&#039;re catchy, memorable, and they&#039;ll do a great job of keeping you watching to see the after-credits scenes (which are also a really nice touch and important to some of the impact of the finale, so don&#039;t skip them). Even if you don&#039;t end up watching the show, at least look up the ending themes; you owe yourself that much.<br />
<br />
In summation... It&#039;s just fine. Go watch it.

    This shows score is very representative of how i feel about this anime. I found decent enjoyment when watching this show, but it was lacking much momentum throughout the series. The story, so to speak, follows the club activities of of the GJ-BU club. I feel that the two most representative genre for this show are, without a question, slice of life and comedy. I went into the show expecting for an element of romance, but that was not found in this show. If you have the spare time, i feel this show is worth watching, but i wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to

<br />
This anime is a great slice of life show with vivid characters among many other similar anime. The story is like many others focusing on a club and its members which purpose is nothing really. We follow the characters in their daily club activities and watch what they are doing as the days go by and how they interact with each other. The story has only 1 male character (which is a quite weak one) and multiple female characters so be prepared for some harem-ish development. <br />
The development for the whole series is not really explored too much which is a shame because it has good potential with its characters. The character development is all right for a show which focuses on humor much more than on telling a story. <br />
The anime delivers great humor with fantastic characters that interact very well with each other and makes sure it doesn&#039;t get too slow and heavy and loses the audience. <br />
A great show that I enjoyed from start to finish and that is why I give this anime an 8.

    There is nothing particularly wrong with GJ-bu in terms of its general comedy, but what convinced me to give it a rating that I usually do not give out very often stems from the Kyolo torture porn. Also, lots of spoilers here, so read a different review if you just want a general thesis on the nature of the anime. This review is more along the lines of something you read after you have seen it and just want to read someone else&#039;s opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I will bring this up right now just to get it out of the way. How the hell did Doga

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218480">
        Kobo, being as little of a production company as it is, manage to acquire the rights to show the characters eating legitimate McDonalds onscreen, right down to the logo and bag being exactly the same? It is introduced right off the bat when you watch it and I found it to be quite hilarious. They even bring up Burger King and KFC, too.<br />
<br />
Basically, well the characters are distinct from each other, they resort to some pretty high extremes to torture Kyolo at times and none of these situations ever have him win. I know this is a common trope in anime, but the fact that Kyolo has no perverted traits about him whatsoever makes this pretty sad, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before I go on further about the anime itself, I also want to bring up the very cruel running gag where Kyolo asked one of Mao&#039;s maids, Mori, to twirl once for him. I thought this was just going to be a one-off joke where Mao teased Kyolo for asking a maid to twirl, but it got progressively worse overtime.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the maid decides to twirl whenever she sees Kyolo. He enjoys it, and was not asking her to do it. So, does this mean that he just gets teased every time he enjoys it? No, he gets tortured every time he enjoys it. I am talking sadistic smiles on everybody as they all kick him to the ground, effectively shattering the character development of a few of them; most notably, Megu, whom should come off as the innocent one of the club, but is willing to torture Kyolo the same as everyone else whenever her maid twirls for Kyolo on her own accord. This alone dropped my overall rating of the anime halfway through as I planned on giving it a higher one otherwise. I am not a big fan of torture porn that is unjustifiable. I will point it out again in case you forgot why I was upset over this:<br />
<br />
1) Kyolo only asked Mori one time to twirl for her and everyone simply teased him for it. Mori, again by her own accord, always twirled whenever she saw Kyolo and everyone always disrespected Kyolo for this.<br />
2) More importantly, well Kyolo had a positive reaction to this every time she twirled, this was by no means a perverted one where he was drooling or anything. If you watched this, you know Kyolo is pretty innocent.<br />
<br />
And speaking of, most of the KTP is heavily unjustified in this anime. He gets bagged on at random points for virtually no reason and it is almost always due to a spontaneous decision by Mao. On top of that, everyone agrees to do it and they take the sadistic torture part a bit too far on most, if not all of them. It gets rather tedious and, due to how stoic Kyolo is, you feel more sympathy for him than you do for the girls. In most harems, this is a common trope, but I have never seen it pushed so far like this. And in every other harem I have seen, the main male lead normally has an advantage in at least a few of the torture situations.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Kyolo, I suppose I can finally dive into the positives now.<br />
<br />
Well, that is, after I bring up one more of the KTP bits. This one, in particular, convinced me that this anime was not worthy of a higher rating. Basically, in the episode, we find out that Kyolo drew honest descriptions of everybody in the room. The first one to be angered, Mao, is understandable because she was drawn pretty hilariously in is drawing and the usual brief, Mao exclusive KTP takes place.<br />
<br />
Shion is next and her description is fitting, yet complementary of her main attributes. Despite this, she (somehow) gets enraged by this and steals Mao&#039;s shtick as she, too, gnaws at him. This was basically hinting that, even if his drawings were mildly offensive, he is doomed to at least some degree of punishment. Speaking of which, the same thing happens to Megu, though this is a little justifiable due to hers also being pretty offensive. And once again, they throw a character out of, well, character, and she leaps at Kyolo as well. Humorously enough, though, her gnawing has no effect at all and Kyolo just stands there confused.<br />
<br />
And, probably the only time Kyolo is actually shown a little sympathy, is when Kirara begins to attack. Knowing how strong Kirara is, seeing her bite Kyolo would be quite frightening and she aims for his head, effectively, yet slowly, shattering his skull; prompting Mao and Shion to actually step in and save him. Hey, at least they are not completely sadistic. They only aim to torture him to the point of death, not actual death.<br />
<br />
But, anyway, back to Kyolo and, now, the positives. He is one of the most respectful male protagonists I have ever seen in a harem. He is not perverted in any way whatsoever (honestly, I doubt he was aroused by the maid twirling, so do not bring that up) and simply aims to help anyone in need. As I said before, he is stoic, but he takes it to the extremes; and even mentions in one episode that he chooses not to be angry with anyone. <br />
<br />
He admits that he can get annoyed, but he would rather not upset the people around him. Now, if we had a Mao torture porn, I am all game for that. Little bitch does not deserve Kyolo&#039;s friendship and, until now, I have never gone so far as to call a female character in an anime a bitch, but this character rightfully deserves the title due to her actions being fully unnecessary almost all of the time. She is honestly worse than Yuna and that is a BIG statement coming from me since she is from my most hated anime.<br />
<br />
As for the other characters, well, as I said earlier, the KTP segments ruin what development they would have, but I will go more on that later. I will only bring up a few since most of them are pretty generic. Out of all the girls, I admire Shion the most as she is probably the most sympathetic towards Kyolo out of everyone else and she has the least creepiest smile during the torture porn scenes; hinting that, perhaps, she does feel bad for Kyolo whenever the KTP segments take place. Also, her intelligence was quite the funny running gag, as it referenced how little common sense she had.<br />
<br />
Another positive were a few of the comedy bits. My favorite running gag is probably Yo-Man. I heavily admire how Kyolo is just able to transform into the generic bad-ass male protagonist whenever he wants, right down to sporting a bigger line (nose) on his face, the narrower eyes and even attitude adjustment. On top of that, with only one exception, he barely breaks out of character. I honestly wanted at least one of the episodes to show him be Yo-Man the entire time to see how disastrous it would be for the females. For instance, him successfully escaping the KTP segments or, after enjoying Mori twirl again, successfully blocks all of the kicks that approach him. If that episode was a real thing, I would rate this two whole points higher for that alone.<br />
<br />
Besides that, I loved it whenever Geraldine entered the room as her English was pretty enjoyable and that is a trait I do not often see in anime where a character speaks entirely in English. I have seen one where one of the characters can speak English, and that is still one of my favorite comedies. But, having one character exclusively speak it was interesting.<br />
<br />
Um, let&#039;s see, I also liked the segments where Shion would bring up one of her brothers and it showed all of them in silhouette form until she revealed what one of them did. All this really does is show the silhouette with tools for whatever task he does. For instance, if Shion brings up how one of her brothers usually cooked her breakfast for her, one of the silhouettes in the background would go to the front part of the segment screen and show his cooking tools. It was pretty enjoyable to me.<br />
<br />
Now, onto the neutrals. Being an anime centered on a club, I was not surprised to see the characters not leave the room whatsoever. That being said, I believe I have only seen a few of these, but the other ones at least had them occasionally leave the room occasionally whenever they decided to play a sport or something. I was a little disappointed that they were solely in the club room the whole time, besides one episode where Mao invited Kyolo out to eat so that she could have a kid&#039;s meal.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I forgot to mention, but Mao falls under the &quot;younger than I look&quot; trope and is actually the oldest out of all the protagonists. Besides that, the last episode actually has Kyolo and Shion walk outside the school so that she could acquire a beverage. That is probably the last time they ever exit the school. Hell even the infamous &quot;beach episode&quot; that most anime have was not followed with this one. They just wore their swimsuits in the club room and that was it.<br />
<br />
My final thoughts on GJ-bu are that it breathed a lot of potential, delivered some really unique comedy at some points, but suffers due to the heavy amount of KTP which nearly prompted me to write a review after only four episodes to recommend not watching this. However, I stuck it out to the end and I do not regret it as it gave me a more balanced opinion, as opposed to just giving up on it and not seeing what else it had to offer.<br />
<br />
I will also bring up one more thing that, well, still does not justify Mao&#039;s actions. Megu always whispered to Kyolo how Mao usually did the things she did to him because she was &quot;shy&quot; or something like that. I suppose you could call Mao somewhat &quot;tsundere&quot; then with this logic, but barely. Her actions still do not make much sense.<br />
<br />
Oh, one major thing I forgot to bring up was that nearly every new character introduced (all female, basically) always had some form of grudge towards Kyolo. The worst was probably Seira, whom had some of the most sadistic statements in the entire anime. Well the girls simply engaged in regular KTP most of the time, Seira was hellbent on killing Kyolo if he &quot;had his way&quot; with any of the girls. It was a bit dark for a comedy whenever she talked, too. A bit of a mix of cringe and fear.<br />
<br />
Fear not, though, for this was also a part of one of its many unique traits. Seira apparently has a disembodied soul in her hair accessory that mutters dark thoughts for what we find out to be no reason whatsoever. Kyolo apparently just has to &quot;put up with it&quot; and Mao is the one that brings it up when she asks if she was hearing the voices as well. This probably could have been a lot more sadistic if Mao knew that Kyolo could hear the voice, but instead teased him about it.<br />
<br />
I could go on a bit longer, but I think I will stop here cause this is just a SoL after all and only twelve episodes on top of that. I can simply say it is an adequate comedy and if you want new offerings, but can tolerate an innocent character suffering a lot throughout the whole ordeal, then give it a go. I enjoyed it for the good bits it did offer, but they did not outweigh the bad bits enough to give it a high rating.
