    While watching episode of Sora no Otoshimono, I thought it was going to be a serious fantasy romance-filled action anime. This was because the way the plot was set, and the way Tomoki has his dreams. I really thought it would&#039;ve been a perfect setting for that type of anime. <br />
<br />
Then, shit happens. The anime goes totally random and it made me LOL; so hard I almost chocked and spilled soda over my laptop. The humor in Sora no Otoshimono is random, but yet it always seems to make me laugh. The ecchi things stuff tomoki does has yet ceased to bore me. <br />
<br />
The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27204">
        are also, setup in such perfect proportions for a comedy anime. A perverted boy with his childhood friend, creepy senpai and class prez. Each character has his/her share of randomness to make you laugh.<br />
<br />
(The humor and story of Sora no Otoshimono, I can&#039;t help but say, reminds me of Inukami. They way Yoko punishes Keita is so similar to what happens to tomoki.)<br />
<br />
Sora no otoshimono is a must watch, if you like this kind of comedy anime. Especially if you like fan service comedy, I guarantee you, you&#039;ll laugh your ass off.

    *Dramatic ending to an overall ecchi humour series*<br />
<br />
“The following story depicts the downfall of my quiet and peaceful life.” – Tomoki Sakurai<br />
<br />
If someone is telling you this anime has flying pantsu (underwear), what will come to mind? People throwing pantsu at each other? Or if you are a bit more creative, perhaps you may be imagining them using the pantsu to wrap around a volleyball for practice? (I really got that as a response before). But will you believe me if I say the underwear in this show can really fly like a bird (heck, they even fly in a wonderful formation in the sky).

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22156">
        Furthermore, what if those pantsu can explode? Yes, they can go KABOOM! How’s that for a change? Assuming you are still hanging around, let me give this one final piece of advice. Stop reading right here if flying and exploding pantsu is not what you want to see because it only gets much more exciting and chances are you won’t like it (ie. you can drop this show from you list).<br />
<br />
Now for the rest of us, where should we begin? How about the ordinary lifestyle of the young man, our protagonist of the story, Tomoki Sakurai? All he ever wished from his small town was to live a peaceful and quiet life where he can eat, sleep, and play. He even made a motto for himself, “peace and quiet is the best”. One night under a cherry tree, a pretty angel came falling down toward our hero and that is how his quiet and peaceful life comes to an end. Who might this girl be? Where did she come from? What kind of past did she have? All these questions will propel the story forward and eventually develop into something much more than what anyone would have initially thought possible from this type of show. <br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly a great deal of character developments, in terms of personal growth, lies with the fallen angel. As the series progresses, she not only begin to show depth as a character, but at the same time get involved in a funny four-way romance. Various characters’ past have also been revealed which explains a lot about their current self, particularly their behavior. This also made them more real and believable as a whole.<br />
<br />
The sound department really deserves special recognition for this show. Not nothing does it have a special, one of a kind, ending per episode, but each ending also features the aftermath of what happened at the end of the episode (think of it as some form of epilogue). As an example, I strongly urge you to look up the second ending (flying pantsu ending). In addition to the various endings, the unique background music (BGM), that does not often repeat itself, also deserves honourable mention. Often times I feel that I was nearly going in tears thanks to these BGM. They make a strong compliment to the already excellent series. <br />
<br />
Sounds come in many different forms. Music obviously counts as one, but voicing is another, especially in the anime industry. Some voices can make a character seem like a lifeless zombie or can totally repel viewers from watching further. Others can bring life to a character, making them more lively and believable. Fortunately, Sora no Otoshimono has a large group of talented casts that helped make the characters come to life and also aided the comedy aspect of the show. If I were to select one seiyu from the group whom I believe have performed the best, it will have to be Souichirou Hoshi (Kira from Gundam SEED, Keiichi from Nigurashi no Naku Koro ni). His ultra hilarious performance as Tomoki, the protagonist, played a key role in the overall success of the series in my opinion. Though his voice may be hard to get used to at times, his role as Tomoki is certainly refreshing, highly different from most of his previous character voices.<br />
<br />
You may think that there is probably nothing else that is good about this series. You are dead wrong. The ultimate selling point of Sora no Otoshimono lies in the animation. While it does not have the unique animation techniques like those we often seen by SHAFT, this series cannot be taken lightly either. Production quality is top notch. With smooth fluid-like animation, great scene transitions, and consistently level of high quality production by the studio, all made this show an eye candy to watch. Of course this is especially true if you are into ecchi-fan service. But even if you are an action fan, you will not be disappointed as the series totally shines with its animation. You have to see it to believe it. Certainly one of the best quality anime (animation-wise) of the Fall 2009 season.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I am not an extremely big fan of ecchi comedy. But Sora no Otoshimono completely changed my view on this genre. I was really drawn in by the emotional scenes multiple times throughout the series. Similarly, I was also captivated by the very sad, yet powerful, scenes toward the end of the show. It certainly showed us that Sora no Otoshimono is not just about pure ecchi humour, but actually have a strong background story to back it up! I would also like to applaud the production studio, AIC A.S.T.A. for a job well done in adapting the original material from the manga. Lastly if you have read the entire review, do yourself a favour and watch the series now. It is only 13 episodes long, so why not give it a shot?

    When you see the phrase &quot;generic, mindless fanservice, you expect an anime thats just horrible. Fortunately however, Sora No Otoshimono is anything but. Surprisingly well done and developed, Sora No Otoshimono takes you on unforgettable ride.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story at first sounds really generic. Small town, childhood friend who happens to live next door and is well endowed, and a mysterious &quot;angel&quot; falling from the sky. Yeah, so it is generic BUT throughout the series, the story gains more depth and eventually becomes interesting and enthralling. As a reader of the manga, the plot follows it to the dot and the pacing is also quite similar. Sometimes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21270">
        it does feel slightly rushed but keep in mind they are trying to condense about 5 volumes of manga into 13 episodes. The more you delve into the universe the more interesting it gets.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
One word :wow<br />
The animation in this series is flawless. The quality of the animation is simply amazing and this anime isnt even based on action. Animation is smooth and consistent throughout the whole series and camera angles are interesting and dynamic enough to add realism in dialouge. In every scene there is something moving and in most cases it is multiple objects (i.e consistant blinking, arm gestures etc). The bigger scenes that incompass massive explosions and giant crap are also done very nicely. Also, there are always different animations for the credits so there is more new animation packed in every episode.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
Im not a real expert at sound but there is nothing wrong with the sound in my opinion. Ambience sound are consistant and sound realistic. The voice actors were nicely chosen and all act out their respective characters well. I&#039;ve heard people say that Tomoko&#039;s voice (the protagonist) is annoying but i&#039;ve had no problem with it. Maybe i&#039;m just tolerant?<br />
Since there is always a different credit theme, it means different songs. WOW. Some of them are just plain silly and some are strangely addictive. Also watch out for ep 10, two great songs.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
The character designs are nice and certainly live up to the generic ecchi anime standards. With this in mind however there really isn&#039;t anything ground breaking when it comes to the characters. Still though, like the plot line there is more than enough character development to keep the series interesting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
Who would have thought that an anime with romance, ecchi and comedy as its central genres be so interesting and funny. You&#039;ll get plenty of laughs here in this series but i warn you, the humour is more on the corny-ecchi side (golden boy) rather the smart ass side (lucky star). Still though, the humour is great and come in great quantities. The extensive use of chibi characters really make the irony in the &quot;serious&quot; scene unbearable.<br />
However thats not to say that the plot line is completely neglected with somewhat cheap humour. As a reader of the manga where this series is based on, the plot is actually quite deep and meaningful. Its really the polar opposite of the humour found in this series. Throughout the series both humour and plot development are nicely balanced so that viewers of the anime are satisfied in both ecchi and plotline values.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
An anime that probably has the highest production value of the season (and dare i say the year), a deep plot and truckloads of humour, this anime cannot be missed. Seemingly neglescted due to its appearance as a &quot;generic&quot;, this anime is anything but. A must watch<br />

    This is an ecchi and comedy, two of my favorite genres. However, the humor usually falls flat with me, and the ecchi is rather tame by my standards and doesn&#039;t have the situational elements that makes ecchi sexy. And there isn&#039;t much else to save the show. The story doesn&#039;t really matter much. It serves more as a premise for the 2 &quot;angeloid&quot; girls rather than a key component of most episodes. In other words, it&#039;s mostly episodic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Comedy: The comedy is wild and exaggerated, using gags, slapstick, and parodies. And it&#039;s corny. It reminds me a bit of a Looney Toons cartoon. The main male

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31943">
        character, Tomoki, is uncontrollably perverted, and the comedy mostly consists of him coming up with plots to see women naked or in panties, and getting beat up in the process. He is shown 90% of the time in chibi form (the small child-like form) with a totally different voice, and almost half of that time he is running around naked. In fact, I almost don&#039;t recognize him when he switches back. I just don&#039;t find this type of dumb comedy appealing.<br />
<br />
Ecchi: I&#039;m a fan of ecchi, but I do find mindless ecchi boring. There needs to be some situational element to make the ecchi sexy and appealing, like a romantic build-up, an awkward situation, or some cuteness. Some of the panty shots involving Sohara early on in the series are quite nice as she shakes her butt around cutely while talking. The brief shot of the girls putting on kimonos was nice too. There was some romance there too, where Sohara developed some affection for the hero as he saved her. But then from about the 4th episode on, any of this romantic/cute ecchi ceases to exist. Instead, it&#039;s all brute-force mindless, emotionless ecchi as Tomoki barges in on girls to catch a peek. With no situational element, it&#039;s about as sexy as looking at a department store swimsuit catalog.<br />
<br />
So with the comedy and ecchi elements being lackluster, and the story being more of background element (and this story being a bit shallow and undeveloped) Sora no Otoshimono fails to deliver. It&#039;s watchable as mild entertainment, but I wouldn&#039;t regret having not seen it.

    Now let&#039;s be serious...the reason you are all probably here is because of the giant rack that you saw on Icarus. But aside from all the semi-nudity and ecchi nature of this anime, it is really quite enjoyable. I started off thinking that this would be like any other rom-com anime and it would be mostly fan service. Im not saying there isn&#039;t any because they go to the bathhouse, the beach, the water park, and anywhere that you can see lots of boobies.<br />
<br />
Story(7/10): The anime doesn&#039;t entirely focus on a story driven plot but it doesn&#039;t mean it is deprived of a story. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review139951">
        moments where the anime crosses over to the darker toned scenes are actually pretty entertaining and they really make you change your perception of the angeloids. Apart from the main story, there are many fan service episodes which are also good and always end up making me laugh.<br />
<br />
Art(9/10): Art is good for the time it was released so there isn&#039;t really much to talk about here, but I have to say that I particularly enjoyed the chibi scenes that happened very often with the main character in his perverted situations.<br />
<br />
Sound(10/10): Sound Is good and the soundtrack is also very amusing. Also the background music used during the more intense scenes fit and added to the anime<br />
<br />
Character(8/10): The characters are your usual bunch of anime characters. The perverted main character, the neighbor and childhood friend who is in love with the main character, the angeloid that turns the main character&#039;s life upside down, the rich and scary upperclassman, the smart and guiding force man person , and the cute angeloid who slowly falls for the main character. A box full of toys that somehow always get into weird situations.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(10/10):I very much so enjoyed the anime. It&#039;s pretty good. Give it a chance. NO YOU WILL WATCH IT.<br />
<br />
Overall(9/10): Overall, it is a good anime that mixes a dark story with light humor and panty shots. If you watch this, I Believe you will truly enjoy it. So give it a chance. You&#039;ll probably like it. I know I did.<br />

    When you hear the words &quot;ecchi romance comedy&quot;, what comes to mind?  Silly, pretty graphics that are fanservice oriented, weak plot and character development?  SnO is certainly a very lighthearted show for the most part, and easily enjoyable for those who appreciate comedy in general. This doesn&#039;t mean that SnO fundamentally lacks the qualities of a good, interesting, and solid show.<br />
<br />
Arguably the biggest &quot;flaw&quot; of the show is that the story premise is as generic as it gets, with the tried and true concept of the boy who meets a magical girl (or angel in this case) who is able to do amazing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review21135">
        this for him, which we already know from shows like Chobits and Oh My Goddess. The question that must be asked is what is done to remix this old idea? In this case, I&#039;d have to analyze the main character Tomoki. At first glance, he&#039;s a rather obnoxious and lazy pervert who merely wishes to live a quiet peaceful life. As events progress, we see more from him, how he&#039;s actually quite capable and motivated to help others around him who are in need. Tomoki&#039;s development towards becoming more sensitive to the people around him so far makes him, and this show stand out. Meanwhile, the time Tomoki loses from his &quot;quiet peaceful life&quot; that is spent caring for the angel Ikaros has contributed to her development in learning about the human world, and developing her emotions for those around her.<br />
<br />
The aforementioned development of the main characters is quite well done, and moving. Even though Tomoki&#039;s shenanigans and Ikaros&#039;s naivety of the human world and her appealing design opens up many opportunities for the &quot;ecchi comedy&quot; part of this anime to take form, the &quot;romance&quot; part of this anime is generally done quite seriously, with characters taking time to reflect on events around them, not mention taking time to also explain their background, which really adds depth to the characters themselves and their emotions for one another, particularly concerning Tomoki&#039;s friend Sohara and of course the angel Ikaros.<br />
<br />
As I was saying how Ikaros&#039;s design is quite appealing, the artwork in this show is extremely well done.  Characters are well-drawn in general, and the use of chibi forms of these characters in comedy moments is done quite appropriately. Animations are also really high quality and diverse, and the choice of music is very catchy and appropriate. The quality of the aesthetics in general is very impressive, and a reason alone for watching this show. What is also quite interesting about this show is how there is always a different theme and scene used for the ending of each episode, so I would recommend not skipping the credits of this show.<br />
<br />
All in all, SnO is a great show, and probably one of the highest quality productions of Fall 2009. This show is definitely for you if you want something that looks nice, is very funny, and has interesting development. The development of this show is so interesting that I&#039;m concerned that 13 episodes is not enough to do this show justice. If a second season to this show will be announced, I&#039;m definitely looking forward to it.

    I was hesitant about starting down this series with it&#039;s label of an ecchi tag. However, this series is pretty good. In all honesty, it would probably turn off many, and draw in others. It&#039;s full of typical Japanese ecchi humor, which isn&#039;t bad if you&#039;re not a prude, a bit of a harem theme going but not in your face about it, and an overall feel-good story. It borders on sci-fi and fantasy, although that part of the story isn&#039;t fully explained. The focus of the series seems to be on the characters&#039; interactions with the main character. There doesn&#039;t seem to be much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review191928">
        background plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn&#039;t like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character. The series only has 2 seasons, so it didn&#039;t get too drawn out like how extremely long series sometimes constantly reuse the same formula.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this series if you want some laughs and aren&#039;t looking for something serious. You would like it even more, if you are into fan service, or are male. If you hate harem and ecchi themes, then you may want to avoid it. The series seemed to be made just for me, so I am giving it a 9 overall.

    The &quot;Magical Girlfriend&quot; genre is one that&#039;s been around long before anime became mainstream. Shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie being prime examples. However, the series that made Magical Girlfriends a popular theme in anime would be &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;. A charming, feel good show that has become a pretty big influence in the industry. Being a template for other similar titles like Chobits, Please Teacher!, Mahoromatic, Sekirei, and many others. Though with every good attempt at a magical girlfriend anime, there&#039;s always those poor attempts that are so horrible, that it makes the others I&#039;ve mentioned feel bad about themselves. And by

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111459">
        far, the ABSOLUTE, WORST magical girlfriend show to EVER disgrace the genre.......is Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. But Heaven&#039;s Lost Property comes in a close second! And heres why.<br />
<br />
The Story (If you can call it that) (2/10)<br />
<br />
Tomoki Sakurai is this little punk ass who&#039;s been having the same dream he&#039;s been having ever since he was young. One his friends Sugata believes it to be a new world. However, Tomoki and his circle of friends have their lives change forever with the arrival of Ikaros. An angeloid who feel out of the sky and became Tomoki&#039;s master. Sparking a series of really perverted misadventures.<br />
<br />
So as you can tell, this is a very familiar set up that&#039;s been done several times before. Examples I&#039;ve already listed. But is it at least done well? OH HELL NO! Almost every episode is filled with plot holes and continuity errors, and the &quot;romance&quot; elements are poorly executed. Not to mention that it&#039;s VERY inconsistent with how angeloids work and function. I can honestly blame all of this on the shows usage of fanservice! Look, I don&#039;t mind fanservice in an anime as long as it&#039;s not overused and it doesn&#039;t take up the majority of it. Examples I can think of are &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, &quot;A Certain Scientific Railgun&quot;, and for a magical girlfriend example, &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;. The problem in this case is that this series focusses WAY to much on the service, and seems to mostly care about giving male watchers erections, that the quality of everything else turns out horribly! And what makes it worse that it can be considered an excuse to give Tomoki perverted reactions to them. Who by the way, has to be the WORST male protagonist I&#039;ve ever seen. But will get to him later.<br />
<br />
So if you&#039;re looking for a deep, feel good romance anime, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!<br />
<br />
The Dub (6/10)<br />
<br />
.....It just baffles me how this awful series would have a very good cast of voice actors for it&#039;s dub. I mean, it has the likes of Greg Ayres, Brittney Karbowski, Eric Vale, Jamie Marchi, Alison Vikorin, Mike McFarland, and Trina Nishimura. These people are very good at what they do! Some of which did voices for some of my all time favorite characters......so HOW they saw potential in this series I&#039;ll never know. I&#039;m surprised that the women who did the voices for the female characters didn&#039;t feel insulted by how this show treats and objectifies women. You could argue that they might be use to it considering they&#039;ve working on ecchi animes before, but if I was a voice actress, and was offered to work on something like this, I would feel disgusted and decline in a snap! But you know what pisses me off the most, is that there are other animes that are considered masterpieces, or at least fan favorites, they have yet get dubbed for the american market. And yet animes like Heaven&#039;s Lost Property get dubs about a year after the first season finishes airing. It REALLY boggles the mind.<br />
<br />
The Characters (2/10)<br />
<br />
Now I talk about what I think is the animes lowest point. And what better way to start, but with the main protagonist of the show, Tomoki. This prick has to be the WORST male protagonist I&#039;ve ever seen, period! A lot of the time he&#039;s just being a no good pervert towards his friends and many of the background girls, and has very little respect for them! Now I just know that fanboys will try defending him by saying he does have his moments where he&#039;s nice towards the other characters, but he suffer the same problem as Louise the Zero! Any sense of character development that he&#039;ll get will be thrown out the window by the next episode, making that nice moment he had completely insincere. And don&#039;t get me started on his treatment to the other main characters. Speaking of which....<br />
<br />
Ikaros was just.....boring. She&#039;s just your typical emotionless girl. Now I don&#039;t mind coming across this archetype more than once, as long as there&#039;s a good variation of it. Just take a look at Yuki Nagato, or Ennis from Baccano!. They were great emotionless girls. But Ikaros has nothing unique to her character, and just comes across as a downgraded version of Ren from DearS. Plus, this anime does a terrible job at being consistent with the fact that she&#039;s an android from heaven, since that fact doesn&#039;t stop her from eating food, shedding a tear every now and then, and so forth. Nymth, I&#039;ll admit was one of the two likable characters of this show. She did have a tragic backstory and her calling Tomoki an &quot;insect&quot; is another plus. Sohara I did pity over her treatment she gets from Tomoki.....until I discovered a disturbing fact about her, that makes her looks like a masochist. Now these main girls are somewhat tolerable, but what makes them unlikable to a certain extent is that they REALLY have no valid reasons to be in love with that asshole. Since he&#039;s guilty of the following.<br />
<br />
1. Hitting Ikaros and talking down to her whenever she screws up with something.<br />
2. Puts Nymth down for having a flat chest. (Cause yeah, that&#039;s REALLY an important feature for a girl to have. *Sarcasm*)<br />
3. Peeps at Sohara changing from next door, as well as stealing her underwear. Not to mention that once he broke into her house during her birthday, ate some cake without asking, and gave her something his grandpa gave him as a birthday present. Yeah, SOME friend you are Tomoki.<br />
<br />
There are two more characters I need to talk about, which are Sugata and Mikako. Now Sugata I&#039;ll admit was pretty bearable, since he does have a nice personality and wants to help people. If anything, HE should&#039;ve been the main protagonist instead. Mikako.......scares the crap out of me. Seriously....something is wrong with her. You just have to see for yourself. But anyways, there are two likable characters, but they aren&#039;t enough to save this atrocious cast, lead by that perverted bastard.<br />
<br />
The Music (5/10)<br />
 <br />
The music was.....okay. But that isn&#039;t saying much. The opening theme isn&#039;t that memorable, and the ending theme.....actually, there&#039;s a different one for each episode. This may sound like a nitpick, but I&#039;m use to animes that would have either one or two ending themes, as well as one or two opening themes. I just see no point in giving an episode a completely different ending theme. Because it feels more like an excuse to have even more ecchi fanservice to the running time. As if we had ENOUGH of that already!<br />
<br />
Overall (2/10)<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Heaven&#039;s Lost Property is easily one of the worst animes I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. As well as a complete insult to the &quot;Magical Girlfriend&quot; anime. The storytelling is poorer than Oliver Twist, the main character is a hateful perverted scumbag, and most of the other characters are either forgettable, poorly written, or both. There really is little to like about this awful anime. If you want a GOOD &quot;Magical Girlfriend&quot; anime, watch Ah! My Goddess, Chobits, and even Please Teacher! They&#039;re more worth your time than this poor attempt at being in their crowd.<br />

    &#039;Sora no Otoshimono&#039; was an extremely pleasant and thrilling experience. In the supernatural genre, this anime is in a league of its own. If you&#039;re not a fan of ecchi or history though, turn away now. <br />
<br />
The premise of this anime might appear banal at first. A guy named Tomoki Sakurai is your average laid-back pervert, spending his days sitting around and doing nothing in particular in between bouts of looking up girls&#039; skirts. One day an angel comes crashing down on his peaceful village and all hell breaks lose. You&#039;d think this idea wouldn&#039;t work and half-way through this series I still couldn&#039;t figure

          <span style="display: none;" id="review69663">
        out where this anime was trying to go with its plot. It gets a lot better later as the ecchines and general silliness subsides and paves way for a philosophical,  mythological and emotionaly disstressing second half of the series. The transition is slow and nearly unnoticable, even if you went on anime watching marathon and decided to see this series in one sitting. It&#039;s absolutely amazing how well this has been pulled off and what&#039;s even more amazing is that it makes this series unique, in a positive way.<br />
<br />
The whole concept of &quot;angeloids&quot; will take you by suprise because you will most likely be thinking about normal folklore-based angels with varying magical powers. Nope. I won&#039;t spoil this series for you so I&#039;m only going to say that nearly every idea pertaining to angels here has been invented from scratch. At the same time however the main theme of the plot is that of a &#039;new world&#039; which is closely based on the European age of discovery and colonisation.  Every episode begins with a history lesson and there are tons, and I mean tons of mythological and historical references in here. You&#039;ll learn a lot watching this anime.<br />
<br />
The characters may appear shallow at the very begining but that won&#039;t be the case as the story progresses. The male lead, Tomoki is a pervert like no other. I can&#039;t even compare him to other male anime characters because he sets the bar so high in terms of pervertedness that no other character comes anywhere close to it. If there&#039;s an opportunity to do something lewd this guy will jump in to take advatage of it, without hesitation. That said, he cares deeply about his friends and is a central figure around which most of the events unravel. He&#039;s pivotal to the well-being of his circle of friends. <br />
<br />
Ikaros is an angel sent down to assist Tomoki in... well pretty much everything. And Tomoki being a lewd sleaze that he is, takes full advantage of that. Ikaros however plays a much bigger role in this anime helping it to convey the ideas of freedom, discovery and... love. She&#039;s also linked to several historical and mythological events. Even her name is based on a mythological person.<br />
<br />
Nymph is an another angeloid and her role in the series is to show the viewer that serfdom can be sometimes cruel. An important issue to be sure but this character was not given enough time and the series could have done better in terms of her development. Even though she&#039;s a tsundere-type character, she is very similar to Ikaros and at times I had the impression that she was nothing more than her different-looking clone.<br />
<br />
Then we have Tomoki&#039;s classmates. An eccentric and totally insane genius (a bit cliche but that didn&#039;t bother me) Eishirou Sugata. His academic and anecdotal knowledge is impressive and his goal is to discover the &#039;new world&#039;, the one angeloids are coming from. He acts as a mentor/teacher to the rest of the characters often guiding them in their actions. We then have the buxom Mitsuki Sohara, Tomoki&#039;s childhood friend who usually karate chops the hell out of him when he&#039;s being perverted - a running gag throughout the series. Her presence is somewhat vital to the plot but I couldn&#039;t put my finger on it. Perhaps she just fits in with the rest of the cast and without her this series would not be complete. And then we have the spine-chilling Mikako Satsukitane, Tomoki&#039;s class president who has the knack of turning peaceful town-folk into vicious killing machines. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on in her head at any given time, but it&#039;s not flowers and birds I can tell you that much.<br />
<br />
Now then with the story and characters discussed, let&#039;s move on to art and sound. I could simply say that they&#039;re both jaw-dropping. And they are but let&#039;s elaborate a little.<br />
<br />
The art is flawless, I couldn&#039;t see a single mistake in any of the 13 episodes I&#039;ve watched. Moreover, the art is precise to the core. Even the smallest features have been drawn with accuracy and precision. I&#039;m talking about movie-grade precision. At times you don&#039;t want to believe that you&#039;re actually watching a TV series. FUNimation and AIC A.S.T.A have done a great job here.<br />
<br />
Now this is where my review might get a little biased. I personally love classical, baroque and late medieval music and this anime features plenty of that type of music. However, I could not see this anime working without any other type of music. Phililosophical and mythological themes call for a classical soundtrack so my personal preferences here don&#039;t make that much of a difference. That said, this series&#039; soundtrack also features modern anime style pieces of music so I suppose everyone&#039;s going to be pleased.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment. Bah, I haven&#039;t been this intrugued and thrilled since I watched &#039;Death Note&#039;. Seriously, the first few episodes might give you the wrong idea but it gets better as the series progresses. You&#039;ll not only have fun but you will also be genuinely interested in the story and you&#039;ll want to know more at all costs! <br />
<br />
&#039;Sora no Otoshimono&#039; is a masterpiece. 10 points.

    Sora No Otoshimono (Heaven&#039;s Lost Property)<br />
<br />
We can all agree that Anime has change throughout the years.. With sexualizing  all the female character with big breast or all the female characters just fighting for the same guy, without the guy not knowing anything.<br />
<br />
-Sora No Otoshimono or Heaven&#039;s Lost Property whichever you would like to call it; starts with the Protagonist name Tomaki Sakurai a perverted high school boy that somehow he wants to live a peaceful life. Later finds a Pink haired girl, Angle/Angleoids falling from the sky, maned Ikaros becoming somewhat his servant.<br />
<br />
The show is pretty much based on the life of Tomaki Sakurai

          <span style="display: none;" id="review177099">
        and how he had to deal with his new life, with Ikaros flying around following him. Throughout the show, each episode isn&#039;t really connected to each other you&#039;ll see random anime change the comedy would make you laugh and you don&#039;t really care about other than Tomaki and Ikaros big breast, and more by putting does things aside is really enjoyable, the story-line is kinda weak, and Tomaki pervaded gets kinda annoying after awhile and breast popping all over the place but by following it and waiting until the credit scene of the episodes everything makes sense (kinda) and realize why the reason Ikaros is doing on in the fist place.<br />
<br />
Later on the series, more Angles/Angleoids would appear you&#039;ll find yourself loving them more then the humans companion that you&#039;ll meet in the process.<br />
<br />
Protagonist/Characters<br />
-Tomoki: Is the obvious Perverted High School boy, that everyone loves and cares, about his friends, and is hard to see him as a serious Hero unlike other anime.<br />
<br />
-Ikaros: Is the Angle/Angleoid that Tomaki meets in the first two episodes, she bow to be Tomaki servant. With no real reason and follow Tomaki perverted schemes with no questions, later she finds herself loving Tomaki, without him not notice him, like any other protagonist  but not able to show emotions she has a hard time showing it, nor she smiles. But shows destructive anger if Tomaki is in any kinda danger. You&#039;ll find yourself for some weird reason wanting Ikaros to tell Tomoki how she feels. hahaha<br />
<br />
-Sohara: Is the next door neighbor and child hood friend, of Tomoki she also the typical girl that loves the protagonist having perverted dreams about him. But instead she keeps it and beats, Tomoki every time he gets any close contact with any other girl, always putting her nose where it doesn&#039;t belong.<br />
<br />
*There more characters that you would meet, while the series goes on* <br />
 <br />
Really recommended if you want to have a good laugh you would enjoy watching it, and somehow you would be able to connect with them... Hope this help :)<br />
<br />

    Take note that i&#039;ve not read the manga or seen the other seasons yet but i&#039;m planning on doing it in the near future and that i&#039;m going all out with my honest opinion here. This is my first review on this site and i really wanted to talk about my disappointment for this anime to someone and what better place than on myanimelist.com<br />
<br />
Hello everyone! This is your guy, HogisGuy. And i&#039;m here with my first ever written review. I decided to write this review because i&#039;ve never been this disappointed of an anime ever but boy have i got a lot (And i mean

          <span style="display: none;" id="review108293">
        A LOT) of hate for my opinion on this series but i hope that you&#039;ll hear me out.<br />
<br />
The first thing i wanna talk about is the story... wait! What story?!! Oh yeah! There was something about an angel from some a*****es in heaven. I totally forgot because i was so busy laughing at Tomoki&#039;s crazy and hilarious shenanigans (if you can&#039;t tell, I&#039;m being sarcastic). Seriously, sometime i forgot that Ikaros really was an angel and thought she was a casual cosplayer or something. It seems like this anime was more busy showing us boring ecchi scenes and those many non-funny scenes with Tomoki and that it probably thought that we would get bored if they didn&#039;t show us more ecchi scenes and keep the actual plot at 45 seconds per episode. And even then the story itself wasn&#039;t that great but at least a hundred times more interesting than the other garbage they threw at us in the series. Though i will admit that i did laugh at some jokes there were a lot more jokes that just fell flat on it&#039;s own face and just died. It also feels like this anime didn&#039;t have any idea what audience it wanted to entertain. The comedy crowd? The drama crowd?! The perv crowd?!! I don&#039;t know and i have a feeling they didn&#039;t either.<br />
<br />
The art and animations was really good and even beautiful at times. The designs on the characters was well done and i enjoyed the art style in every single scene (except for the &quot;HILARIOUS&quot; nipple-song scene). <br />
<br />
Characters... OH JOY!! I&#039;ll start and finish it all with the poor excuse of a protagonist, Tomoki. Let me quote something from the book &quot;I have no mouth, and i must scream&quot; to describe what i feel for Tomoki... if i was a machine:<br />
<br />
“HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I&#039;VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.” <br />
<br />
I HATE Tomoki! He is not funny! He is not deep! He is not interesting! He is nothing! I would love to know who decided for this thing to be the protagonist of the series so i could slam his/her head into the wall and scream &quot;Why?!!&quot; into his ear over and over again. Tomoki doesn&#039;t contribute with anything to the series. I love how the anime is constantly trying to make me believe that he is important in this anime when the most common problems he runs into is following:<br />
<br />
1: How can i sneak into the girls locker room?<br />
2: I can&#039;t afford this porno magazine? Well in all my years. I guess i have to work for some cash then.<br />
3: How are we ever going to get those panties back on Sohara. What a pickle!<br />
4: What&#039;s that Ikaros? You wanna move the plot forward? Hah! That&#039;s funny but seriously though, how can i sneak into the girls locker room?!!<br />
5: Are you sure that transforming me into a girl is gonna get me inside the girls locker room?<br />
<br />
You got a beautiful angel that will do ANYTHING for you! And if any of you people say he doesn&#039;t do anything with her because he&#039;s deep and emotional and would never take advantage of a woman like that. Yeah i think it&#039;s kinda too late to convince me that when i just saw him grope two women. You know what? Sugata is the better protagonist for the series. Yes i know that he too got some weird fantasies, playing around with dolls but here&#039;s the thing! He (unlike our villain &quot;Tomoki&quot;) actually gets some s**t done. He researches the angels and seems to be more understanding and interested about them and want&#039;s to know more of their world. What does Tomoki do? ... He writes songs about his nipples. CHARMING! <br />
<br />
I want to give this anime a lower score because giving it an overall score of four makes me feel dirty but the thing is that this anime isn&#039;t poor. Because when you get to the good parts and especially the last few episodes i was really invested and found it even sad for what poor Nymph had to go through to get Ikaros home. I have nothing against Ecchi animes or mangas, hell i even love them but when you focus on it too much to the point where it gets in the way of the story you have to realize that it&#039;s going to wear out fast. I actually love Manyuu Hikencho and High School Of The Dead.<br />
<br />
- But HogisGuy!! HOTD has breasts and unnecessary panty shots. And Manyuu Hikencho is just naked breasts through the whole series.<br />
<br />
Sure. HOTD has a lot of pointless ecchi scenes but they are out of the scenes as fast as they are in and yes, they do get boring at times with those panty shots but it never loses track of it&#039;s story and even has time for good character build-ups except for Shizuka who is totally pointless to the show and manga so far. Manyuu Hikencho&#039;s story revolves around big breasts. You can find it funny, you can find it hot. I see it as a hilarious and to be honest, a good story for it&#039;s ludicrous world and that&#039;s something this series gets right unlike Sora No Otoshimono.<br />
<br />
Now then, i don&#039;t hate Sora No Otoshimono. I just don&#039;t think it was as good as some people tried to make it out be. Here&#039;s to the second season being better but i have my doubts.

    There really isn&#039;t anything that special about this anime. It&#039;s your typical ecchi comedy where all the girls have big boobs and the guys keep getting nose bleeds. However, I&#039;d still recommend watching this anime because it&#039;s fairly short so if you wanted to you could knock it out in a few days, it always put a smile on my face when I watched it, and there are some actually dramatic moments in it.<br />
<br />
This anime&#039;s best quality is how much personality each character has. Of course, this anime isn&#039;t as serious as Full Metal Alchemist so it isn&#039;t like every character has this complex reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144207">
        for their actions, but I love how much emotion each character shows and how every character contributes to the show in their own way. For example, Mikako is kind of the shows antagonist and she loves anything involving other people getting hurt like if she sees two people disagreeing her solution is for the two to have a dual to the death and whoever lives is right.<br />
<br />
Like many anime comedies, there&#039;s a hint of romance in this anime, but it&#039;s interesting how the romance develops. Tomoki and Ikaros don&#039;t really fall in love so much as Tomoki teaches Ikaros what love is. Ikaros is such an innocent character and so oblivious to basic emotions she has a tough time grasping the concept of love so she becomes confused when she feels it. Most of the serious traits in the anime are eclipsed by all the comedic moments, but I can still see how Ikaros changes on the inside as the anime progresses. <br />
<br />
Now, the biggest problem with this anime is how there are way too many pervert jokes! Seriously, every episode has to have Tomoki trying to look up a girl&#039;s skirt or molesting someone. It gets old after a while and I&#039;m just happy this anime&#039;s short because I don&#039;t think I could watch even 50 episodes of it before I&#039;d throw in the towel. <br />
<br />
Overall: This is a pretty funny comedy to watch even though the jokes do get a little old at the end. There&#039;s a pretty descent romantic element to it and, of course, tons of magic. The story is almost non-existent, but the characters are truly this anime&#039;s best quality. <br />

    Ok, 1st time typing review, don&#039;t blame for my poor grammar and vocab...<br />
<br />
  Well, Actually it has quite a Good Start ahead with the story, A boy with a weird ever-happening dream making A suspense and then beautiful angel appears. It&#039;s kinda of anyone&#039;s dream when they were kids.<br />
  And, Well the characters designs are quite OK and viewer-friendly, big eyes (not that all 1-color-highlighted eye or simple neko eyes), Cute and chubby facial shapes and the setting for the character is quite different but to their own charms and good features. And, btw the wings, battle suits are quite pretty as well....<br />


          <span style="display: none;" id="review190644">
         Ok, for the VA, yup they have succeeded to make one&#039;s character appealing and much lively, (Nice) well, my favourite character is Ikaros(female MC) and she sang OP and some ED of this anime along with Bluedrops ( her voice is sweet - Saori Hayami)<br />
  And, what is great about this anime is the randomness , the creativeness of ecchi pantsu jokes and pranks and collaborating with some serious events and feels.<br />
  Well, not that i boast about myself, I can understand average things quite clearly and this anime really is easy to read, suitable for leisure or as a side-dish combo with other strong-taste anime.<br />
  Well Rome doesn&#039;t built in one day, so does this, try to collect small events, hints and stuffs in it then you will feel what it wanna give to you, just a reminder&quot; don&#039;t watch it all for Pantsu and Oppai, watch the Overall, I am sure it worth your time, well i have watched it thrice though.... Hahaha<br />
  Enjoy ~~~

    ***SPOILER ALERT!!!***<br />
<br />
From here on, I&#039;m not paying attention to how much I could spoil, but I may spoil some things on the way; you have been warned. (Now that I&#039;ve read it though, it looks like I&#039;ve only spoiled minor things...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, first off, let me say that this will be my first review and I do not mean to offend anyone with my comments.  I am expressing my opinion and I hope you will respect my opinion as I promise to respect yours, as well. <br />
<br />
This anime was one of the first ones I heard of through the internet, back when I first started

          <span style="display: none;" id="review68843">
        to watch anime, and when I watched it, I had high expectations for it because everyone else seemed to really love it and give it good reviews!  I really, really, want to say that I like it but I just can&#039;t... It wasn&#039;t something that was torture to watch, but I didn&#039;t enjoy it too much, either.<br />
<br />
I gave the story a 5/10 here.  Man, what can I say? The first episode, as usual, started off with a decent enough story, in which the female lead, Icarus, makes a &quot;sudden&quot; and &quot;surprising&quot; entrance and meets the stunned male lead, Tomoki; veeery original.  But any hint of a story is always swallowed up by the filler-esque humor.  For every three episodes, one might progress the story.  But unfortunately, everything turns out to be bland and predictable, right down to the characters&#039; actions, but I&#039;ll get to that later. The only time story can be squeezed in is when Tomoki shuts his big damn mouth, which hardly ever happens...&gt;_&gt; An attempt was made, no doubt, for there to be a nice story, but story-wise, this anime just falls flat...I can&#039;t say I enjoyed the story until the latter half of the anime, in which a bit more happened.  But the plot is nothing new, special, or surprising, and the story that the humor is based around all feels forced; trapped on an island, the beach episode, new girls go to the school, the festival, and the last episode, in which the male lead gets mini speeches from his friends, and gives the mini-speech about friendship to the heroine and the power of love wins against the baddies!  <br />
<br />
The art gets an 8/10 here.  Its not ground-breaking, but its pretty enough, the animation is fluid, and there are no awkward animation moments to note.  Not much to say here except that I despise the way that the characters, ESPECIALLY Tomoki, are chibi-fied at the drop of a hat. The animation is the part I enjoyed the most, but it wasn&#039;t a great reason to watch the anime.  <br />
<br />
The sound gets a 6/10, because although I liked the OP, the OST&#039;s weren&#039;t anything special.  How should I put it.....I don&#039;t think the sound was bad.  It&#039;s just something that enhanced the experience and there were no problems; pretty average. I don&#039;t like how in the last few episodes, they shoved sound effects into the OP, as if they wanted something different and were too lazy to make a parodied OP or something along the lines of that...As they say, &quot;Do not fix what is not broken&quot;.  For the ED, I can&#039;t really say if I liked the fact that each episode had a different ending song... Some might like it, but I prefer one OP and one ED.  But hey, that&#039;s just me.<br />
<br />
Character...Oh boy, where to start?...OK, lets start with Tomoki.  <br />
For the &quot;strange dreams&quot; he had with the angel introduced in the first episode, I was hoping to see more, because that could have really helped the plot, but it was only referred to about once or twice more, and ended up as something to put in his character description to make him &quot;special&quot;...Well, let me say, if MAL had a least favorite character list, he would definitely be in it! All he does is scream out obvious things, make disturbing noises, act frustrated, and talk about being human once in a while. After 13 episodes of his ANNOYING voice (all I hear is the sound of a boy with voice changes going &quot;Huhuhuhuhuhuhu-uuuu-uuu...&quot;) that makes me want to stab soft furry things, his not-cute chibi that substitutes for him 70% of the time, and the little wing covering up his private parts, I want to push him into a volcano and watch him burn slowly. &gt;:D  The worst part is, the girls in his harem love him for the 5% of the time when he makes a serious face and talks about human feelings...the rest of the time, he&#039;s being a purposely perverted pubescent pervert.  (Sorry, I couldn&#039;t resist XD)  I can&#039;t think of any worse shounen leads... my favorite part is when he becomes a girl and has a different damn VOICE.  I find ecchi situations more funny when they&#039;re by accident, and the lead isn&#039;t agressively trying to peep, but there&#039;s no such thing here; no sir!  Tomoki is just  a vicious pervert and I don&#039;t see what everyone sees in him...He&#039;s  just a peeping Tomoki. *snicker* Seriously, this series is just overusing that joke, and now it&#039;s a dead horse.  <br />
<br />
While I&#039;m on the subject of overused, let me start on the other characters, which are all recycled.  First, Sohara, the clingy, jealous, childhood friend, a harem favorite.  Another harem favorite, the abused and tsundere-ish loli, Nymph.  She wasn&#039;t that bad, in fact, she was one of my main reasons for watching Sora no Otoshimono because she&#039;s so cute.  Yeah, she wasn&#039;t horrible; she and Icarus were the only ones with character development in the anime.  Icarus was fairly decent and I liked the watermelon theme for her for some reason.  It was a nice touch, but still not enough to save the show from Tomoki...&gt;:I In the end, she is one of the better ones, but she is still the &quot;emotionless girl&quot; with limited addition to the character&#039;s background.  She was predictable all the time; for example, with the episode in which she&#039;s in the band, I knew right away that she would sing, if only for the sake of the fans.  Speaking of background, we have Sugata and Mikako, the slapped-on characters used to &quot;round off&quot; the cast.  It&#039;s like, they&#039;re just there...to be there. Yes, each episode starts off with a history lecture from Sugata; some were funny but most were annoying or boring.  He&#039;s just that &quot;epic smart guy with glasses that he pushes up his nose who points out conspiracies&quot;. I have no problem with that, it&#039;s just that his character feels out of place in the genre, and would fit in better in Sci-Fi or something that has conspiracies to reveal.  Mikako is just another sadistic &quot;kind&quot; girl, but I only laughed at the character a few times, as she also felt out-of-place.  But what made them feel most tacked-on is the fact that they both start out knowing everyone, but it is never explained how any of them met each other. At least in Sohara&#039;s case, there was a brief and decent explanation as to how she met Tomoki. <br />
The characters get a 4/10 and I hope you understand why I selected this score. ^~^<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the comedy. This anime is 90% slapstick humor and virtually all of the humor involves Tomoki being perverted.  &quot;Tomoki runs around naked after seeing naked girls because he is about to get hurt&quot;  pretty much sums it up.  I was never a fan of slapstick humor, and it&#039;s not that funny when it&#039;s the same situation over and over again.  Slapstick humor is best sprinkled on like a seasoning for the events that lead to it; events that are different! Take the anime &quot;Nichijou&quot; for example- it is hilarious to watch the characters be wacked by things because it&#039;s a result of a funny situation- no one is screaming and they sit with straight faces as they are hurt.  But the execution was not something repeated over and over and OVER.  Each situation was different.  They don&#039;t scream around naked making wierd noises and yelling about getting hurt; the people who made that know that that would be boring and what you would expect.  Yes-- Sora no Otoshimono wants you to laugh at how it looks instead of the story...  There was hardly any creativity involved, and a *perverted* 9-year-old could have made the &quot;funny&quot; parts in this anime.  When I don&#039;t find myself laughing for an entire episode of SNO, I can&#039;t argue with my instincts; it&#039;s just not that funny...I laugh pretty easily, so don&#039;t be pointing fingers.  The comedy gets 4/10 because, basically, it&#039;s not very original.<br />
<br />
As much as I would like to like this anime and give it an 8, 9, or 10 like other people have,  I&#039;m gonna have to say that it fell short on both comedy and plot.  The art and sound were the most enjoyable parts, but not as important, and the biggest disappointment were the characters.  Therefore, I will have to give this anime a 5/10.  But I&#039;m still open-minded enough to watch Season 2 (and 3?) because it would not be difficult to improve upon this anime.  Also, because I never drop and never plan to drop an anime.  I want to like it, but its potential was wasted.  Please respect my opinion, and I apologize if I have offended you.  Thank you for taking your time to read this, and I hope my review of the anime &quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot; helped you! :) <br />

    If I could describe &quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot; in a way that almost perfectly suits it I&#039;d say &quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot; = Epic Trolling With a Story and Plot. And here&#039;s why I believe that:<br />
<br />
STORY: 8<br />
&quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot; doesn&#039;t focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how Ikaros became Tomoki&#039;s &quot;Pet Class Angeloid&quot;. But it really doesn&#039;t need to as more than likely the sequels will explain that. In a Story perspective it mostly focuses on the daily events of Ikaros adapting to the human ways of life while attempting to understand her master and his perverted ways. As well as trying to understand

          <span style="display: none;" id="review54259">
        herself. The whole cast is constantly entangled with hysterical events such as flying panties that can achieve higher speeds than the famous SR-71 Black Bird (which leaves the pilot o_0 WTF?), exploring the new world that is the girls bathroom, a festival turned into a blood bath because of the attractive opportunity of 10,000,000 yen for shooting your neighbor, and understanding what it means to go on a date. <br />
<br />
ART: 10 <br />
This was clearly for me one of the best hand drawn and partially CG&#039;d anime&#039;s I have ever seen. Sora no Otoshimono stands rightfully and proudly next to Steins;Gate and Nisemonogatari. Kudos to the staff for such wonderful, beautifully hand drawn characters. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 9<br />
The opening was actually worth my time to watch as well as the different endings each and every episode had. I mean who else would watch openings and endings other than for the music it has? And as much as I liked Tomoki&#039;s song of &quot;My Tingling Nipples&quot; I still feel the music was just a tad bit shy of perfection. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 8<br />
I feel that all of the main characters deserve their own criticism from me separately as they have earned it so here it is.<br />
<br />
Ikaros: Our somewhat emotionless heroine. It seems that the story leans more toward her than it does to Tomoki. As she attempts to understand what it means to be human and blend into society anonymously (tho fails epically). She unknowingly takes her master&#039;s and co&#039;s lessons that try to teach her to be more human like far too literally. Often concluding with humorous results. Such as lying. (The lying lesson was NOT given to her by her master and co but by a passerby) As this passerby tells what I presume to be his girlfriend &quot;lying is human&quot; Ikaros takes this to the extreme. Shockingly telling a chef his food looks like shit, while also declaring to a mother her baby is hideous. These are one of the many reasons why you might just fall in love with Ikaros. <br />
<br />
Nymph: She isn&#039;t completely introduced until episode 6. A bit of a delay to present the show&#039;s tsundere but better late than never. I personally enjoyed the introduction of Nymph. What would you think if you woke up in your household, went to your living room, only to find a complete stranger comfortably making themselves at home in your household? You&#039;d possibly freak the fuck out if you didn&#039;t have anyone else with you. But with Nymph having a connection with Ikaros it only made it more mysterious of why she&#039;d even be there. Her characteristics are also very familiar but not despised of. With the traits of a tsundere and attitude of a smart aleck, she also attempts to understand what it is to be human. She is shown often calling Tomoki and anyone else she sees as an idiot a &quot;bug&quot;. But as the story progresses she opens herself like every other tsundere would. She reminded me of Haruna from Kore wa &quot;Zombie Desu ka?&quot;. (well Iori Nomizu does voice both Nymph and Haruna lol) Nonetheless, she is a welcomed character to the series.<br />
<br />
Sohara Mitsuki: Sohara felt more like a side character than a real main character to me. After viewing the first episode and observing her characteristics, I quickly realized that I have found yet another typical childhood friend who fails to convey her feelings properly to the boy she loves. This is such an overused concept in anime that it has started to annoy me. Time and time again I frequently run into anime&#039;s that use this same concept. Whether it be &quot;Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity&quot; or &quot;Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi&quot;. In the end the result is the same: Childhood friend either wins the heart of his/her love interest or doesn&#039;t. So what was enjoyable about Sohara now that you more or less understand what I am seeing? Nothing much sadly. The best way I can describe her is to say that she is a cup that is half empty. The description given about her reveals no spoilers and nothing new in the anime world. She typically karate chops Tomoki for not giving her the attention she utmost desires. Although he does deserve it with certain actions he takes, she shouldn&#039;t be frequently chopping him for every small perverted thing he does. He&#039;s a maturing man like he said and needs to tune his manliness. How could he help getting a hard on in the morning? Hasn&#039;t she ever heard of something called morning wood? I am fully aware that the developers put her in the story for a love triangle relationship and a comedic effect. But after a while I had grown more attached to Ikaros (and even Nymph) that I figured it probably would have been better to ax her and never introduce her to the story in the first place. It was funny the first few times she knocked Tomoki&#039;s lights out. But after a while of the same shit and repeat, it began to make me question if she was worth the time introducing and putting the effort to make her part of the show.<br />
<br />
Tomoki Sakurai: A troll genius. Possibly every wish he has I wish greater. Whether it&#039;d be the power to turn invisible to grope my girlfriends tits, or freeze time to run around streaking in public. It wouldn&#039;t matter as long as I have a beautiful Angeloid that obeys my every command and that accompanies me throughout my mischievous deeds. And that is precisely what this lucky little bastard has done and gone through. His motto (which is one that Me Gusta) is to live in peace and quite. But after running into and forever bonded to an Angeloid named Ikaros, that soon changes indefinitely. As he constantly throws himself into 100% lethal situations which he is only to be saved by his gorgeous Angeloid. Although ironically Ikaros is one of the major sources of chaos and disarray, he full knowing this continues to support and help her in her quest to be more human like. His characteristics are that of a perverse old man. His desire to sniff panties and wear them cannot be stopped. His raging hormones strongly portray what it means to be young, dumb, and full of cum. But despite all of this, he still has that soft spot for caring about what matters most. The well being of his friends and his Angeloid. <br />
<br />
Mikako Satsukitane: The sadistic bitch in the series. Reading the description about her practically notifies you of what is to come when she is brought into the story. While her presence seems that of a bystander she is involved partly in the story. She is seen mostly around Eishirou. Conversing her thoughts on his thoughts of the new world. She and him feel to me more like background characters that fill in the empty space of what could have been.  I do enjoy her haughty smile and deeply provoking comments, but this is one bitch you don&#039;t want to fuck with. During Ikaros&#039;s silver tongue moment, she specifically stated Mikako was &quot;nice&quot;. Anyone with half a brain would instantly recognize what she meant by that. <br />
<br />
Eishirou Sugata: The man who dreams to find the new world. Going as far as to creating his own home-made glider only to make a few &quot;miscalculations&quot; and plummet from the skies above to meet the concrete floor. It seemed to me that he was completely obsessed with the idea of there being a new world above us. He portrays himself as a shady character with little to no background. He is the founder of the New Continent Discovery Club and is found in the beginning of each episode presenting to you his pretty assistant and a &quot;The More You Know&quot; like dialog. He continuously provides information that should not be know by regular human beings. And it seems he has experience with Angeloids. As he states to Ikaros &quot;Stop playing dumb, you couldn&#039;t possibly be a Pet Class Angeloid.&quot;, as well as having a high-tech computer that monitors Ikaros&#039;s state and condition. <br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 9<br />
A few times I almost fell off my chair laughing from its humor that it constantly loves to give to its viewers. It does have a lot of ecchi moments involved but I wasn&#039;t bothered by it at all. If anything I enjoyed it. I loved the story as well as the characters and the art was simply gorgeous. The sound was near perfection and the story set out for what it was going to do. And that is a humorous and enjoyable time. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9<br />
&quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot; is a Comedy, Ecchi, Sci-Fi, Shounen, Supernatural anime with some romance sprinkled on top for good measure of an amusing time. I most certainly enjoyed putting 312 minutes of my spare time into &quot;Sora no Otoshimono&quot;. It may not be for everyone as this mainly aims for a comedic effect and an ecchi audience. But it also has some super cereal moments involved for you ManBearPigs. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime that aims to make your stomach hurt from laughter. This is one that should not be missed. I most certainly will not forget this anime like I have forgotten others. As this one has earned its right to claim its throne among the last that are to be forgotten. <br />

    A very hilarious anime which will cheer you up in no time if you&#039;re feeling down.<br />
i laughed hard at all the episodes, never got bored.<br />
which made watch whole episodes without any break.<br />
i like how the main character turns chibi making it more funny.<br />
the story is typical like any other anime with same genres, pretty girls falling from sky giving powers to the lead male and eventually falling in love..<br />
Despite all that it still cracked me up lot.. You should watch it am sure you will love it unless you are a kind of gloomy,shady person who enjoys dark sad anime. WATCH IT NOW!!

    I happened to stumble upon Sora no Otoshimono when perusing some anime blogs. It was reccomended as the best comedy anime of the year, so I decided to check it out. The series is easily found online or on a DVD (they have it on eBay for those who don&#039;t live in Japan) and it is subtitled (not dubbed---an automatic check in my mind).<br />
<br />
Now this series is a comedy primarily, but it has some romantic/sci-fi elements. The plot centers mostly around getting a laugh, except for the last few episodes of the season. It certainly doesn&#039;t dissapoint.<br />
<br />
If you don&#039;t like perverted humor and prefer things

          <span style="display: none;" id="review24177">
        to be funny because of the language versus situational humor, this probably isn&#039;t for you. But those of us with dirty minds and the ability to laugh at an anime that can laugh at itself will enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Especially great are the sequences they play during the credits....always really funny and entertaining.<br />
<br />
Overall, not exactly the most original plot/characters but it is pretty funny and is good for what it is.<br />
<br />
Fair warning: the theme song is really, really catchy and there are a lot of boobs.

    My first review, give some constructive criticism on improvements!<br />
<br />
Hmmm... Sora no Otoshimono (or Heaven&#039;s Lost Property), is probably THE BEST example I&#039;ve seen of an Ecchi comedy that manages to successfully transcend the realms of stupidity to produce an excellent anime with a memorable story and amazing characters. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you fell from the sky yesterday... right... - Tomoki<br />
<br />
This quote from the first episode, combined with Tomoki&#039;s reaction effectively sums up how over-the-top Sora no Otoshimono(SnO) gets and how mind-numbingly insane, the situations that are going to occur in Tomoki&#039;s life will be. Tomoki himself states that this story is the depiction

          <span style="display: none;" id="review39791">
        of the downfall of his peaceful and quiet life, into flying panties, well endowed angeloids and karate chops that defy every possible law of physics. It&#039;s exactly this stupidly over-the-top comedy combined with the excellent art direction and characters that make SnO such a great show to watch. It never takes itself too seriously or tries to present over complicated plot and character developments every five seconds, instead it relies on natural character development and maturity and certain key moments of plot development resulting in both a touching story and great Ecchi and comedy moments thus keeping the viewer entertained and hooked episode upon episode. The humour never gets stale, SnO keeps it interesting and mixes it up just enough so that you, the viewer continue to laugh episode after episode.<br />
<br />
The art of SnO is beautiful, instantly from the first episode you can see this show has great production values, the characters are well drawn and the environments are varied, and very well coloured. Being an Ecchi comedy the girls and their underwear are incredibly well drawn and the girls themselves designed and detailed to near perfection. The animation is also very fluid and dynamic, and feels very natural to they eye. Boobs bounce well, skirts fly and panties get flashed with graceful movement (is that even possible!??). The characters are often represented in Chibi form, which is very well done and fits in with the shows comedic nature, it continuously reminds the viewer not to take the show too seriously and adds to the overall humour. However where the art and animation really shines in this series is the characters facial expressions and emotions, Icarus one of the angeloids carries a sad, melancholic expression throughout the series, and to put it simply it looks amazing, the studio really succeeded in making believable emotions and this works great with the character development.<br />
<br />
The sound is another plus for this anime, the OP is a kind of catchy, melancholic song that really represents the series emotional and serious side, the ED or should I say EDs are where this show feels unique and interesting. Each episode has a unique ending that ties in with the events that took place during that episode, and are accompanied by an epilogue styled animation that shows the aftemath of what occured during that episode. The BGM is also good, it fits well with the comedy and really compliments the emotional scenes when they occur, theres also never a moment in this show where you hear a piece of BGM and feel its overused or too predictable.<br />
<br />
Now comes the part of this show that makes it shine compared to all the other Ecchi comedies out there, the characters and story. The characters of this show are the main reason why it&#039;s so enjoyable they all feel natural and are developed well giving viewers a reason to pay attention to them. Since the cast of recurring characters is small the producers manage to give each character ample enough time to become well developed. One of the characters that stood out for me has to be Sugata, described during the first episode as a highly intelligent, extremely creepy and perverted guy and also introducing each episode, he has the most interesting role in the series. He attempts to discover the so called &#039;New World&#039; where the angeloids came from thus he continuously observes Icarus and Nymph. He is highly intelligent and perceptive thus picking up on things no one else in the series manages too, his comments and dialogue often give the viewer understanding and insight as well as questions about the angeloids and who they really are.<br />
<br />
The story is another plus point to this anime, it is very well executed and fits in with all the randomness and comedy of the show, in most episodes the story is just an undertone and is shows through the way the characters develop and interact with each other. However during the select key moments of the series when the story takes the driving seat, it executes well and piques the viewers interest making them ask questions and wonder what is going to happen next, it also manages to make very effective use of emotion making the viewer want to be involved in it all the much more. The seriousness picks up most at the end of the show and the viewer really feels and understands the angeliods, giving the story and excellent and dramatic ending.<br />
<br />
All in all SnO is a beautiful and well executed show that shows just how versatile the Ecchi comedy genre can be if done properly.<br />

    soooooooooo sora no otoshimono or in english heavens lost pet is a cool anime if u like ecchi(xtreme :D),harem,sciene fic,great chicks,comedy,romance,action <br />
<br />
the story isn&#039;t that uniqe but it satisfies the watcher.the story goes like this:<br />
<br />
there is a boy named tomoki he saws the same dream and cries when he wakes up of course he is  curious to find out what is the dream about.then someday he goes to the hill where a giant sakura tree is so then a gap in space opens and some materials(bricks kinda or statues whatever)starts so drop and of course our guy is a normal guy who doesn&#039;t wabts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25063">
        to die so he starts to run.but then he realizes that a girl is falling down and he(thinks so hard about it) goes and tries to save the girl but like i said he is a normal human and he&#039;s short(1.50 i think) so he is compelled to even lift the girl then he sees a giant statue is falling down right in to their heads but then girl awakens and take the boy and flies away from there.then she connects a chain around the tomoki&#039;s hand(by the way that means she is accepted him as her master).then they start to live together many many situations came up blah blah blah...<br />
<br />
the only thing that i didn&#039;t liked about the series was the main character man they made him like a ultimade pervert.of course every boy,man,human is pervert(and im one of them as well :D:D) but tomoki is a new level of being called a pervert i hope they change the personality of him in second season.<br />
<br />
songs and musics that played in the anime was cool and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
art is marvelous if you wath in a good quality(mainly in ecchi scenes :D:D)<br />
<br />
if you think it&#039;s cool just go for it :P

    Mere ratings cannot describe this show. I cried like I haven&#039;t cried in the last three years after that show. So emotional at the end, but very well worth it. The story was absolutely stellar, the best I&#039;ve seen so far. The art is pretty good, the character development is brilliant, and it never failed to make me laugh, even in the most embarrassing moments. Just an all around great anime. If you are planning on watching it, watch the first two seasons, then read the manga til the end, then watch the movies that replace seasons 3 &amp; 4. Otherwise, you miss a lot
