    When I was first watching love live superstar, I writ a review on how good I thought it was. Since then, it has managed to maintain that quality throughout all 12 episodes and has now became my favorite in the love live franchise and I&#039;m going to now explain why it is worth your time:<br />
<br />
<br />
-New to love live, should I watch the others first?-<br />
<br />
No, you do not need to watch any other seasons and I actually believe that this is the best place to start if you want to get into the franchise<br />
<br />
-Art and animation-<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen many shows and I am quite the fan of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421106">
        the &#039;cute girls doing cute things&#039; genre but it rarely looks this visually appealing. You can really tell that the budget has been thrown into this show, especially with things like the backgrounds that are so detailed that they bring a fresh atmosphere to the typical anime high school setting. Animation is also really smooth and the characters express their feelings and personalities through exaggerated movement very well.<br />
<br />
-Characters-<br />
<br />
Compared to the other seasons, the main cast has been cut down to only 5 members. I think this was a great idea since each character gets to have a well developed backstory and motive, instead of some of them being left out. Also, due to the characters all having more screen time, it is a lot more easy to get attached to them since they don&#039;t just come across as one dimensional. The designs themselves are also quite unique, look nice and convey the personalities of the characters well.<br />
<br />
-Soundtrack-<br />
<br />
With this being an idol anime, the soundtrack is really important and I thought a lot of the songs were good, especially if your a fan of jpop. There&#039;s also the additional bonus where if you do like the songs, then more will be released outside of the anime for you to listen to. On top of this, there is some great piano background music which works so well for conveying the emotions of the characters during more sad scenes.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t lie and say its the best story you will ever see but it doesn&#039;t have to be. Just having the plot of some teenage girls wanting to make it as idols works as a great catalyst for drama and acts as the central character motivation that drives them. The individual character backstories are also realistic and well written.<br />
<br />
-Comedy-<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much anime, even labelled a comedy that can make me laugh this much but somehow this one did. A lot of the jokes are ridiculous and catch you out of no where and because you like the characters, it becomes amusing when they say/ do dumb stuff. Sometimes when the pacing is slower, this is what keeps you invested in the episode and brings in some fun scenarios that makes me realize how much I love the absurdity of anime sometimes.<br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
<br />
Enjoyment is definitely the reason why I love this anime so much. It won&#039;t change your life but it might make you smile and laugh and I think that&#039;s something that&#039;s underappreciated when watching media. If you just want to not think, have a good time and watch cute girls then I recommend this and if not then that&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
-Voice acting-<br />
<br />
Considering most of these voice actors are completely new they all did a great job. They also continue the brand of live live voice actors with doing interviews and stage performances where they seem like genuinely amusing and nice people. To top that off, they also have nice singing voices as expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if you are looking for something simple, with nice visuals, characters and you either like or don&#039;t mind jpop songs then I recommend you watch this. A lot of people may think this stuff is &#039;cringe&#039; and I can see what they mean by some moments in older seasons but this one feels very modernized and acts as a great starting point for new fans, a great reintroduction for past fans and a brilliant addition to people who follow the franchise religiously.

    Catch your dreams together with your best friends.<br />
<br />
Love Live! is an idol franchise that is supported by many enthusiastic fans. I&#039;m a newcomer who got into Nijigasaki last year. Because I couldn&#039;t accept previous eyes design. I was avoiding this series for a long time. But Nijigasaki and Superstar are big surprises in terms of graceful music and cheerful characters. Especially Superstar. This show has some energetic messages. I know Love Live! seems unique and interesting since before. Superstar fits my preference. Not your typical idol stuff at all. Style is character-driven so I&#039;ll mention centrally about it.<br />
<br />
The setting is Yuigaoka Private Girls High School.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421102">
        The main characters try to become school idols there and form an idol group named Liella! before long. Kanon Shibuya is the protagonist of this show. She loves singing but can&#039;t do it due to a certain event. However, she never gives up for become a superstar-class idol. She makes use of her own pleasant personality and extremely high potential in some scenes. In other words, motive power. Kanon is not only looking but her behavior is also elegant. The strength vividly appears in front of members. Kanon&#039;s essence is kindness. She never abandons her important people and doesn&#039;t twist her faith. Kanon is a great character.<br />
<br />
Other characters are also very fantastic and lovable. Keke Tang is a Chinese girl who has firm pride and definite maxim. She is very stoic about raison d&#039;etre of idol. Keke is basically bright and talkative but her feeling against school idols is real. She shows no weaknesses to anyone including Kanon. Don&#039;t judge a book by its cover. She and Kanon&#039;s relationship is profound. They&#039;re confident in each other. Early episodes are remarkable. Two meetings are the beginning of everything. Kanon can change in a good way by virtue of Keke.<br />
<br />
Chisato Arashi is the best childhood friend of Kanon. She has a well-proportioned face and lit hobbies. But she is too serious regarding her limit. The point is related to her main episode. Chisato is not noticeable compared to Kanon and Keke but an irreplaceable girl. She is a sympathetic supporter of members. She is always encouraging members and can say some useful advice. I love it.<br />
<br />
Sumire Heanna is GALAXY. Yeah, GALAXY. She is a girl who is not tolerant of school idols contrary to fashionable appearance. The reason is understandable when you saw her some depictions. That&#039;s why there is no chemistry between Sumire and Keke. At times two euphemistic conflict is charming, at times bickering. Actually, Keke continues to deny Sumire&#039;s potential until episode 10. I understand Keke has no offense. Sumire is conscious of she must do her best more. You can expect their drama in episode 10. As a result, Sumire and Keke are good combinations in various ways. Sumire is delicate, strong-willed, very human for me. I can understand the passion inside her. It depends on the preparedness degree. Sumire doesn&#039;t need to think too much about herself.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Ren Hazuki. She is a controversial girl. She opposes the definition of school idols and tries to abolish them. Episodes 7 and 8 are written about her background but there are many contradictions.  Ren has bitter history and complicated family circumstances though, their reasons are inconsistent. I felt like those are retro-continuity. You can understand by watching these episodes why her action is strange. Except for all of them, Ren is a good girl. She just didn&#039;t remember her inhere talent and personality quickly. Her singing prowess and leadership make people happy. And cute.<br />
<br />
Your rating will decide whether you can empathize with Liella! from the heart. They&#039;re enjoying youth and have various ways of life. Laugh, angry, be glad, suffer torments, get over. Their story is just getting started. Believing in each other is most important and some dramatic events won&#039;t go to waste for them. I think they won&#039;t end their dreams as dreams.<br />
<br />
Atmospheres are very heartwarming and the story is also wholesome as the SoL genre. Animation, visuals, live scenes are so beautiful. Voice acting is excellent (Ren is a bit monotonous but I don&#039;t care about it). The best thing is music. Every song is catchy, eargasm, outstanding. OP/ED songs are really memorable. I realized again Love Live! is one of the biggest popular idol series.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed Love Live! Superstar!! so much. Adorable characters, funny dialogues, very strong drama. Not only this series fan but new viewers like me are also can get into this show. Keeping hope connected to our life and future. It can also be said Liella! IMO. When we saw them shining like the sun, it will certainly be a good chance to change something.

    Like how the wider society used to judge anime fans as nerds that like obscure Chinese cartoons, the wider anime community looks at Love Live! fans and idol fans alike with the same weird gaze. There’s this stigma of “I’m not one of those idol weebs”, but I reckon this too will soon fall to the wayside, as the quality of idol shows becomes harder and harder to gloss over.<br />
<br />
I was one of the doubters before watching Love Live! Superstar!!, and the only reason I started it was because of a clip of Tang Ke Ke’s tantrum. The irony of a Chinese heroine requesting freedom

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421100">
        from a Japanese school is something I just cannot miss. And I’m glad something silly like that had gotten me to watching this show, because nothing else would’ve otherwise.<br />
<br />
Tang Ke Ke’s antics aside, the characterisation of the cast in Superstar!! is incredible. Having only five instead of the usual nine members in the group is certainly a fine change. It goes without saying with less characters, the show gets to allocate more time and go into more depth with each of them. I’ d love to give examples, but going into detail about how memorable and strong everyone’s situations or personalities are would be no different from spoiling the whole show for you.<br />
<br />
Now this is where my inexperience comes back to bite me: I have only ever watched the OG Love Live!, and I haven’t even finished it. So people can point out how Superstar!!’s story is “repetitive” and the only reason why I don’t find it tiring to watch. And they have every reason to believe so: three out of the four school idol groups from the Love Live! had the goal of preventing their school from shutting down.<br />
<br />
The other thing that people always bring up without fail is how the story is predictable, and it’s no exception in Superstar!!. But these holes in these arguments are easy to spot, even with my untrained eyes regarding this genre. Love Live! isn’t here to serve you a unicorn narrative, it’s to entertain you with just enough novelty with new characters while retaining as much familiarity in the story as they can. It’s kind of like fast food chains if you will, you go there because of the predictability and consistency, but there’s always enough variety so you don’t get the same things every time. It shouldn’t be a secret that people can find comfort in that.<br />
<br />
It’s not like nothing is fresh story-wise. The way that Hazuki joined Liella!, although unassuming, is unlike anything that came before. Her reasons were presented in a eureka moment that juxtaposes her perviously established character; it&#039;s subtly hinted at and built up to that moment. Tang’s personal struggles are the most relatable thing you could ever imagine; you would know if you live with Asian parents. Obviously these will not be the most mind blowing thing you have ever seen, but its still a breath of fresh air in the formulaic idol genre. Even the most stubborn fast food chains should change up their menu once every few years. (Okay I will stop with the fast food analogies)<br />
<br />
With eleven years worth of experience and three different installments of Love Live! under their belt, Kadokawa, Lantis, and Sunrise better spice things up a notch. And they didn’t disappoint, delivering us the best rendition of the idol’s road to prominence narrative through Superstar!!. Character motivations for joining are much clearer and make much more sense, the group felt like it took serious effort (and luck) to build. The point of conflict in the series is also an organic result of the group member’s insecurities, rather than something that is derived from an external plot device. These improvements are, again, only possible because of the extra time granted by reducing the number of members in the group.<br />
<br />
The things I have said above might well be controversial, point granted, but I believe anyone with a pair of well-functioning eyes will see the amazing animation displayed here. Sunrise has clearly improved over the years, not only in animation, but also in choreography. It’s no exaggeration that Superstar!!’s 3D animation is the best I have seen to date: the eye-catching dances, the smooth transitions from 2D to 3D, the small attention to details on matters of continuity, they really have it all. You may point towards ufotable or studio Orange, come back to me again when they have their demons or anthropomorphic animals do idol dances on stage. I know I am rambling at this point but I cannot get over how expressive the 3D models have become and how well choreographed the dances are. To those who are curious which performance is my favourite, it’s the one where they sang “Wish Song”, by a mile.<br />
<br />
I’ve been singing (haha) praises for Superstar!! for a while now, but I wouldn’t be able to tell you with a straight face that it’s perfect. When thinking about its faults, two distinct scenes come to mind:<br />
<br />
First one is where Hazuki is giving her speech when the whole Liella! squad interrupted her to try to convince her that “this idol thing really is great, trust us”; it was awkward, drawn out, and overdramatic for my tastes.<br />
<br />
The second is rather minor, but it’s also so stupid I don’t know why it was even made in the first place. Let me elaborate with as little spoilers as possible. Through certain circumstances, Tang wants to give Sumire a crown as costume for their next performance. She is conflicted to accept it because of reasons, before she can decide, a strong breeze had blown the crown out of Tang’s hand and sent it flying. Sumire follows it, running and falling into a bush before finally catching the crown, accepting it. Yes, a metal crown was sent flying by wind to dramatise this scene. Trust me, this doesn’t get better with context and is as bland as my words described. <br />
<br />
I know that some suspension of disbelief is granted with these kinds of shows, but the end product is not good enough to justify these inconsistencies. If they would stop relying on it, I bet Love Live! as a series, not just Superstar!!, would reach a wider audience.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Love Live! Superstar!! is no doubt the most ambitious of its kind since Bokura no Live Kimi to no Life. It made so many steps in the right direction for the controversial genre that is idol anime. Love Live! has been huge in Japan ever since its release in 2013, and I reckon future generations would point back to Superstar!! for being the start of the idol praise for anime fans in western hemisphere.

    The Love Live franchise and the series that it produces has always been a coin flip to whether it&#039;s going to end up being mediocre or great. If you were to ask me what side of the coin did Love Live! Superstar!! land on, I would confidently be able to tell you that it landed on heads.<br />
<br />
Superstar is a great entry show to the Love Live franchise as it doesn&#039;t have any connections to the previous Love Lives, making it an easy and clean entry to just turn on and watch. It was a bit of a surprise to me that Superstar took up the:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421099">
        &#039;school is closing down&#039; cliche so late into the season. What surprised me even more, while continuously watching it week by week, was that it didn&#039;t shove this cliche down your throat 24/7. In comparison to School Idol Project and Sunshine, Superstar takes this cliche at a different approach. The cliche still serves its purpose of giving the girls more motivation. But instead of constantly hitting us with this theme like in School Idol Project and Sunshine, Superstar makes the girl&#039;s desires, to help one another overcome their own problems, as the make focus and theme of the series. This emphasis on the girls gives them more room for growth as characters, whilst using the &#039;school is closing down theme&#039; as, just as another motivation when needed. You may argue that&#039;s this cliche is the appeal of School Idol Project and Sunshine, but I believe this approach for Superstar was the right choice to make.<br />
<br />
What School Idol Project and Sunshine lacked in my opinion was the growth for all their characters. Each character likely only got one episode per season focused on solely them. Yes, these episodes with my favorites characters were some of my favorites to watch, but they lacked MAJOR growth as a whole. They likely only solved one problem they were having at that moment. What Superstar did in comparison was that they cut down the cast to 5 members instead of the regular 9, which gave more room for development and growth as individuals and group chemistry as a whole. They kept struggles each character had within them (e.g. Kanon&#039;s stage fright, Sumire&#039;s inferiority complex, etc).  They didn&#039;t shallowly cast it aside during the episode it was brought up, rather it waited until the group as a whole was able to help solve it together, making the series flow more naturally and made it feel more realistic.<br />
<br />
Although one of the negatives I found in Superstar was the weak rival group that was hardly used in the story. What I think School Idol Project and Sunshine did better in comparison to Superstar was that they made full use of their rival groups as another major motivation. Sunny Passion felt shallow, as they were hardly given screen time and felt forcefully used in the story. They aren&#039;t another main driving force Liella uses as motivation, unlike each of the character&#039;s personal struggles or the school closing down. Sunny Passion is sort of just sitting on the bench waiting to played, but ultimately stays and keeps it warm.<br />
<br />
Ever since Sunshine, the quality of animation, art and also character designs of Love Live has just gone up and up since then. They still have their trademark exaggerated faces which everyone loves and as an added bonus, derpy faces are used when the characters faces are out of zoom, which I personally loved to death. Superstar also has some really amazing background art to go in tandem with the amazing CGI. Heck, sometimes I couldn&#039;t even tell that some of the performances were in CG. Everything about the art just felt really clean, almost even perfect.<br />
<br />
As expected of Love Live, all of the songs are such a bop. The Ending, &#039;Mirai wa Kaze no You ni&#039; is probably one of favorite endings in Love Live of all time. The song itself is amazing, but the visuals is what makes this ending so great. No there aren&#039;t any hidden themes found within the Ed, it&#039;s just the group of Liella having fun and showing some of their daily activities. As a bonus, each of the members of Liella join Kanon one by one as they do the trademark waving, one of my favorite scenes in the Ed. But this simplicity is what makes it so great, fitting to Love Live&#039;s main slice of life genre. As also expected of Love Live, all of the voice actors are amazing. They perfectly fitting to the corresponding character they play as and have distinct and beautiful voices. <br />
<br />
What Love Live always excels at is making amazing and likable characters. Even if you don&#039;t like them at first, you somehow always end up loving them in the end. Superstar&#039;s characters, don&#039;t feel like a re-skin of any of the characters from the previous Love Live, which were a major problem for some people when watching Sunshine. Each of the girls help each other grow as characters. Their struggles don&#039;t feel shallow, and as a viewer, it&#039;s really satisfying to watch them overcome them because of that fact. The smaller cast and group also helps flesh out each of the characters more, even with the smaller episode count. It really lets the viewer to get to know the girls more and lets them grow onto the girls more and more.<br />
<br />
Superstar is overall an amazing successor to the Love Live franchise with it&#039;s; iconic cast of characters, corresponding with equally amazing voice actors, it&#039;s trade mark character designs, and it&#039;s amazing songs which makes this series/franchise so appealing in the first place. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s an amazing installment to the Love Live franchise and didn&#039;t disappoint in any aspects what so ever. If anything, it well exceeded expectations.

    I see a lot of people being nice to this show, and while I kinda see why, I also really don’t. In Japan, Love Live is an insatiable money-making behemoth whose appetite only grows with the eating, but here in the West, it’s largely mocked by the mainstream. But apparently not Superstar. What other people are getting out of this show is something I can’t get out of it, and it might just be because I’ve seen too much. It might just be because I’ve become numb, and maybe if this was the first time I’d ever seen an idol show like this, there’d be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421101">
        stuff I could pick up on which didn’t seem like tired, insipid, clickbait garbage, but I’m too old and storied for that shit. I’m fine with media selling itself, I’m not a child, but when it comes to idols, the girls themselves are the products, and while an anime’s storyline can help dilute this reality, I can’t not see it, so everything just feels fake. Despite being well-directed, the concerts are totally non-diegetic, because they’re being shot from angles no in-universe camera could ever capture. One of the girls is an antagonist to a point, where upon the cast spends two episodes confronting her corny, melodramatic backstory, after which she immediately becomes part of the team even though she’s an outsider who everyone hated five seconds ago. A character travels from a competition in Tokyo to the Southern Islands before the sun can finish setting, waiting for her there is a costume which she never planned to have made, in which she performs flawlessly alongside the others despite not having practiced the set. The show is comprised of contrivance after contrivance after contrivance, thoughtlessly and lifelessly checking off boxes on a bulleted list of Love Live tropes required by the producers. Not every relationship feels this soulless, and not every action feels this manufactured, but to those pretending like this series is significantly more genuine than any other installment of Love Live, I’m afraid I must disagree.<br />
<br />
After all these years of having watched thousands and thousands of anime, I’ve deduced by far the easiest way to dismiss a series is to scrutinize its production, because most anime look like shit and cut so many corners they become entirely different shapes. Indeed, most generic trash actually LOOKS like generic trash, but this doesn’t. This looks legitimately impressive, and since I couldn’t write it off, I had to endure it, and the technicality behind the concerts was so jaw-dropping, I cannot pretend I didn’t have fun here. The girls have their gimmicks, but their character designs are so much more individualized than previous installments of Love Live, it’s commendable. Love Live girls have always had copy/pasted faces, bodies, hairstyles, and personalities, only adding enough of a difference between them to be legally distinct, but this show breaks the mold in that respect completely. Each girl looks and acts like a separate human being, not like a slight variation of a figurine, body pillow, or cardboard cutout which you already own. They aren’t deep, and some of the forced backstories I mentioned earlier certainly bogged down the script, but the girls are still pleasant and cute. It feels like everyone creatively involved in this project has improved measurably. We all know Yoshiaki Fujisawa is a genius, and while Jukki Hanada still can’t write convincing drama, he still can write funny dialogue and natural chemistry between characters. Love Live has singlehandedly revolutionized the landscape of CG, and Director Kyougoku has absolutely mastered the art of transitioning between the mediums of 2D and 3D. The CG integration is better than some Production IG shows, and the CG itself outclasses Studio Orange. This show is no visual masterpiece, and episodes seven and eight saw heavy inconsistency, but the animators absolutely pampered these girls as much as they possibly could, even if they only exist to fuel Bandai’s merchandising.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading.

    Let me start this off by saying that I do have bias toward Idol anime and Love Live on the whole because I do really like the series. Also, I don’t score/assess anime entirely in a vacuum, I compare them amongst other anime of the genre. <br />
That being said, Love Live Superstar is absolutely excellent thus far and I think this is a must watch for people who at least enjoy the series a little bit, or enjoy idol anime in general. <br />
<br />
Characters - 9/10:<br />
<br />
Right of the bat the characters design wise are great. Love Live never has a shortage of unique designs for its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413085">
        characters, albeit some of them do end up maybe a tad generic, but I don’t have that issue with any of the characters in Superstar thus far aside from maybe Hazuki.<br />

Design aside, personality wise all of the characters are already so endearing, whether it’s Kanon’s adorable reactions, Keke with her over-the-top energy, Chi with her relaxed but fun-loving vibe, Sumire’s personal foil between her confident exterior and anxious interior, and, well, jury is still out on Hazuki. All in all, I could easily see this becoming my favorite collection of characters in Love Live, or maybe any idol show for that matter.  <br />
<br />
Art/Animation - 10/10:<br />
<br />
Honestly, it’s stunning. It’s not like it’s the best or most unique style amongst all anime or anything, but it fits perfectly. The way the character expressions and reactions are animated never fail to make me smile and/or laugh and even sequences where the characters are dancing (e.g. practice) are done very fluidly. Also, everyone who has watched idol anime before knows that performances typically rely fairly heavily on CGI, and that often takes away from the appeal. While I can’t say superstar doesn’t do this, the usage is not only mostly light comparatively, but also, it’s done extremely well as can be seen in the “Tiny Stars” performance.  <br />
<br />
Music - 10/10:<br />
<br />
The OP, the multiple EDs, and the intermittent performances that we have gotten so far have been incredible. I’m one of many who is guilty of being a serial skipper of OPs and EDs and yet I haven’t done that a single time with Superstar. In fact, I’ve actually rewound to listen to the ED again and listened to  <br />
<br />
Story - Love Live/10:<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, this is a Love Live installment, so let’s not pretend like we’re going to get some groundbreaking story. However, to evaluate it how it is, the character progression for Kanon and Sumire already has been great, and I can’t wait to delve further into Chi’s and Hazuki’s side and to see what trials and tribulations these girls will face as they strive for Love Live. <br />
<br />
<br />
To summarize, if you’re a fan of Love Live or the idol genre, this is already a must watch in my opinion. Sure, I may be jumping the gun, but I could easily see this becoming my favorite Idol anime, and certainly my favorite installment of Love Live. <br />

    Superstar is the 4th installment of the beloved and long-running Love Live series. It is easy to follow and does not reference previous parts, allowing both old and new fans to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
This installment goes back to its roots, arguably simpler than the base of its roots were. Kanon gets picked up by Keke to start a school idol club, but complications arise when the student council president tries to stop them; the standard Love Live stuff.<br />
<br />
The special part about it this time is how Kanon acts in opposition to the other main characters of previous installments of Love Live. Kanon has stage fright. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421136">
        stage fright helps drive her character throughout the story as an obstacle for her to get over. It is a good character element that can add some growth and depth to her character, but I felt it was rushed. There were not many episodes where it was the main focus and even when it was, I felt it was not explored enough.<br />
<br />
This pacing issue crosses through Sumire as well. Ever since she was a kid, Sumire has always wanted to be in the spotlight but had never been there. This would also provide for an interesting plot, but once again, underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
As rushed as I may be describing the pacing, this was only felt during the last third of the show, which is when a lot of the important parts of the characters&#039; arcs happened.<br />
<br />
Contrary to this was Chisato’s character arc. Chisato was introduced in episode one and slowly developed throughout the show. This is due to her arc directly tying into her relationship with Kanon, and how they affect each other. It climaxed beautifully and became my favourite part of Superstar.<br />
<br />
And once again, in opposition to Chisato’s arc is Ren’s arc. Ren’s character arc did not make too much sense and was not developed a lot, kind of just happened.<br />
<br />
Finally, Keke. So far, Keke’s arc has only been hinted at and not a lot has been revealed about her, even if she was the first member to join the group. Frankly, this is not a bad thing, as a later season is likely to go further into her character.<br />
<br />
So far, I have only spoken about their development, but how are they individually? Honestly, I think I only like Chisato and Kanon individually.<br />
<br />
Even if I only like two of them individually, the writing is something of note. The characters play off of each other very well. Every character has a different way of speaking to each other, whether friendly (Kanon and Chisato) or a more aggressive tone (Sumire and Keke), creating a very immersive environment and overall makes character interactions an enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
The writing also excels at telling jokes. The jokes are very fast-paced and usually succeed to at least put a smile on my face. It combines both visual humour and wordplay, effectively churning out jokes quickly. It is more visual than wordplay but is still a great combination of both.<br />
<br />
Now onto the more technical aspects, the visuals of each new season of Love Live are always astronomically better; this applies to this season. Hair bounces with each step and the animated dance choreography always looks clean. Full of bright colours blending well together to create appealing visuals that are hard to get bored of.<br />
<br />
As it usually is with Love Live, the performances where they sing and dance are mostly CGI. Love Live has quite the mixed history with CGI, as sometimes it looks very off, and other times it looks pretty decent.  In this case, the CGI looks good. Used solely for the dance segments, studio Sunrise can create higher production choreography and CGI. It does a smooth job transitioning between the CG and the animated parts during the dance segments to help emphasize movement.<br />
<br />
These stage performances also sound great. Love Live is often associated with cute girls and high-pitched voices, but it is cute girls and “normal” pitch voices this time. This change can make the anime enjoyed by many more people, as many people were turned away by Love Live due to their high pitch.<br />
<br />
In addition to looking and sounding good, they also flow well. Every time song is broken into, it feels like you know exactly when it is going to happen and instead of being boringly predictable, it is satisfying to see.<br />
<br />
Alongside the dazzling stage performances, the background music is also good. Nice and relaxing most of the time, but it can also get you a little hype for the more dramatic moments.<br />
<br />
Despite its characterization and pacing flaws, Love Live Superstar provides a fun time for both new and old fans of the series. It has arguably the best looking and sounding in the series and is overall a worthwhile experience. I will be looking forward to more of it!<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ve never completed Love Live. I watched episodes from each of the seasons, including Nijigasaki, but I didn&#039;t like them. There were too many characters and they weren&#039;t interesting to me at all.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I was tentative to pick up this series. But, I did, and I can say, from someone who doesn&#039;t like the previous instalments of Love Live, this is a really good series. <br />
<br />
The story is about girls being idols. What more can you ask for?<br />
<br />
The art is so pretty and stunning. The character designs are great.<br />
<br />
I love the music in this series. Everything in it is a bop, especially the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413144">
        opening song. <br />
<br />
What really makes the show, however, are the characters. The characters in this are hilarious and are given plenty of time to really shine. Keke is my favourite and she sells the show.<br />
<br />
If the series stays this good, I know it&#039;ll stick the landing. I never expected a Love Live series to be one of my favourite shows this season, but I have no regrets.

    This is the first time i&#039;ve watched idol genre stuff, I thought I wouldn&#039;t enjoy it, but unexpectedly its more enjoyful than I expected loved the songs, artstyle, characters and the story too that I would like to try the other alternative settings of Love Live! too and if you tried this, it wouldn&#039;t disappointed you. Though you will lose your bad thoughts and get feel relieved after watching this thats why I loved it than the rest of my Summer 2021 watchlist, I would like to see more different types of this anime in different settings in the future so the hype of the

    When Lovelive superstar came out, I wasn&#039;t interested because I&#039;m not a lovelive or idol fan. I thought it is going to be generic idol anime which indeed it is, but one thing that caught my eyes is this Lovelive anime has a character who speaks Chinese and very good Chinese, which instantly gave me a boner to watch this.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it was quite surprising and hilarious when the character is speaking Chinese. Because it is very rare in anime to have an anime character to speak a foreign language (except English). Secondly, it served as a purpose and identity of the character why she speaks

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414644">
        Chinese. The character who speaks Chinese is very fluent and quite charming to listen to. Although in the show she only speaks it 2~3 times. <br />
<br />
The story is very straightforward, a girl wanted to become and form a school idol to become an idol. They began to train and collect more people to join, later performing their blood and sweat off. Very simple to watch, if you&#039;re like me who didn&#039;t watch any lovelive franchises, this would be a good start to watch. <br />
<br />
The animation and 3D legit gave me an erection. All of the characters are very expressive and unique, especially when they dance very clean and giving you some butter nutting. Ah yes~<br />
<br />
Music, it&#039;s Lovelive won&#039;t disappoint you.<br />

    Story: 7<br />
<br />
Cute girls doing cute things!! The story reuses some overused elements from earlier Love Live series and there are one or two weird plot elements, but the formation of this series&#039; school idol group, Liella!, is satisfying. The main characters are all first years, and the ending of this season sets up subsequent seasons to show Liella!&#039;s journey after the first year. This would be the first Love Live series to show more than one year of a group&#039;s journey, so I&#039;m excited to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
<br />
The scenery and backgrounds in this show are extremely detailed and colorful, and the quantity of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421203">
        different backgrounds used in each episode is incredible. Specifically, the buildings and streets feel warm and immersive. I think this sets a new standard for art in Love Live anime.<br />
<br />
I was skeptical about the character designs initially, but I grew to like them after the first or second episode. They are all cute, and their expressions and costumes are equally cute.<br />
<br />
CG is used during the dances, and it blends nicely with the hand drawn animation. There were some cool effects such as the lighting in Tiny Stars and the reflections in the bubbles in Wish Song.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
Love Live is known for its music, and every song in this show is good. Mirai Yohou Hallelujah!, Mirai wa Kaze no You ni, and Tiny Stars are outstanding. My other favorites are Tokonatsu Sunshine, Dreaming Energy, and Nonfiction.<br />
<br />
Superstar&#039;s ED is my favorite among all the Love Live EDs. I love hearing the ED begin to play during an emotionally climactic scene. The song begins with delicate piano notes and becomes more upbeat as more instruments begin playing. This creates a beautiful feeling of hope and catharsis. The character who was the focus of the episode sings the ED, and this makes it hit extra hard. The music, lyrics, and visuals portray Superstar&#039;s themes of faith in oneself. At the start of the chorus, the girls are shown running together along the Olympic Bridge at sunset. The animation in this shot is beautiful and fits the tone of the song perfectly.<br />
<br />
The seiyu&#039;s performances were outstanding. Their singing was consistently beautiful, and their voice acting was amazingly expressive. Painful and sorrowful moments sounded and felt real. Also, there were plenty of cute and funny sounds during slice of life scenes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
The 5 main characters are great. This season shows us how they meet, and we see them become friends, play together, work hard together, and give each other support. The character development was satisfying, and I cried during a few episodes.<br />
<br />
The rival group, Sunny Pa, does not receive enough screen time. I hope they get more in season 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
I love Love Live, and I loved watching Superstar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
If you like Love Live, I recommend this show. If you like cute girls doing cute things and singing and dancing, this show is worth a try.

    Love Live! Superstar is a solid show production-wise, but its position as the fourth separate continuity in the franchise only highlights the increasingly formulaic nature of Love Live&#039;s writing. <br />
<br />
The show starts out promising enough. Kanon is our now apparently archetypal spunky orange-headed protagonist. Unlike Honoka or Chika though, she gets to have real character flaws. She&#039;s grumpy, she sulks, she talks back to her family. She loves to sing, but she has struggled for years freezing up in front of an audience. When we meet her, she&#039;s convinced she&#039;ll never make it as a performer. There&#039;s potential for a focused, if rather well-worn, character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421183">
        arc here that Love Live has never really done before. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this lasts about two episodes in total. Within days of meeting Kanon, Keke sweeps her up into doing the school idol thing with her, with only token resistance from Kanon. One pre-concert jitters scene later, Kanon&#039;s stage fright is cured forever (or at least until we pretend it&#039;s still an ongoing issue nine episodes later to try to have some kind of conclusion for the end of the season), and we never see her acting moody again. Apparently, solving a lifetime&#039;s worth of anxiety issues is sometimes just that easy. A few episodes later, Kanon&#039;s childhood friend Chisato mentions that she specifically went into dance so that she could help Kanon out by doing the things Kanon can&#039;t do, but the implications of this put the opening arc of the show in a weird spot. I guess despite the two being close friends for nearly ten years or so, Chisato just never tried hard enough to help Kanon conquer her stage fright. <br />
<br />
Aside from all that, Kanon herself is very popular at school, even though it is barely mentioned outright. Kanon handily wins a class vote for their idol group&#039;s center where most people voting would have no reason to care, and she&#039;s implied to have had a very good chance at the student council president seat if she hadn&#039;t refused to run. She&#039;s struggled with stage fright in front of her classmates for years, but the only bullying that ever happens is over Chisato drawing some stick figures in the dirt at a public park when she was a little girl. It&#039;s like a committee took someone&#039;s script and proceeded to shave off anything with the remotest chance of offending someone, all for the purpose of circling back to the safest route possible. <br />
<br />
As we build up the school idol club, we&#039;re informed that—surprise, surprise—the student council girl, Ren, is against it. Why? Well, her mom was a school idol too, but she never kept any records of her club activities, and she apparently only mentioned her feelings about it once to Ren. But Ren forgot—yes, really—what her mom said to her, and thus concluded that her mom must have regretted being a school idol, it&#039;s the only explanation. She is thus very vocal on her anti-school idol position as she runs for student council president. Ren manages to get the votes of the general curriculum students by promising that everyone will get to participate in the upcoming school festival.<br />
<br />
Once she&#039;s elected however, she insists that only the music course students will be performing, because she believes it&#039;s the only way to get more students to enroll in the school. Yes, apparently, the school is in danger of shutting down. Yes, again. Not only is the plot point derivative to the point of self-parody, but logistically, it makes little sense. Yuigaoka is literally in the very first year of its operation since it was formally refounded. How could it fall into such dire financial straits in the span of a few months? Are we to assume there&#039;s some embezzlement happening behind the scenes?<br />
<br />
Ren&#039;s abrupt about-face in policy naturally upset the general curriculum students who start a petition in protest, and we see heated arguments break out between the general and music course students. Oh, but don&#039;t worry. All of this is resolved within the episode when Kanon and the gang showed Ren that no, her mom really did love being a school idol. So Ren relents and immediately reverses her position, allowing the general curriculum students to participate in the school festival. In response, the students all clap. Literally, everyone claps. Apparently, there&#039;s sometimes no one more understanding than a room full of irate teenagers. The school shutting down doesn&#039;t even get brought up again until it&#039;s suddenly solved off-screen in the final episode, so I guess it wasn&#039;t that important either?<br />
<br />
Before Superstar aired, I had hoped that the smaller than usual main cast was a sign that we would see more nuanced, fleshed out characterization, but the characters are just as shallow here as when we had nine main characters in previous Love Live anime entries. Nothing the characters do have any real consequences, and every conflict is resolved almost immediately. There&#039;s never any stakes because the characters are never allowed to meaningfully fail. Early on, the fledgling school idol club is given an ultimatum: they have to win first place in an upcoming idol festival or they&#039;ll have to disband. They end up losing to the contest favorite school idol duo Sunny Passion, but the school just shrugs and lets them have their club anyway with no pushback.<br />
<br />
Sunny Passion functions as our main rivals, but they might as well not exist for how severely underutilized they are. Their whole characters can be summed up in three traits: they&#039;re nice, they never sing on-screen, and they look like they got picked off the cutting room floor of Aikatsu character designs. They get a full episode where they invite the girls out to perform at their island resort, and even then they have barely any presence. I&#039;d be surprised if anyone remembers their names because they matter so little.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, our main cast of girls get to have cute antics with good production values, but that&#039;s all there is to it. The only character flaws they have that aren&#039;t tossed aside are ones that can be spun as cute, as if they&#039;re disguised strengths in the weaknesses category of a job interview. The one exception to this is when the focus shifts to Sumire, whose hangups get treated some actual weight. She&#039;s insecure and afraid of failure, and that doesn&#039;t magically all go away after receiving one kind gesture from her friends. Two episodes cannot carry a series however, and the show otherwise never tries to be anything more, quickly quashing any hints to the contrary.<br />
<br />
Love Live is a mega popular franchise with more than enough dedicated super fans to weather a few unexceptional anime entries, but a franchise that keeps playing safe is one that will eventually hit a wall in market saturation. As of now, Love Live is juggling three different active groups to run the live concert circuit: Sunshine&#039;s Aqours, Nijigasaki, and Superstar&#039;s Liella! Each one has the same basic premise of starting a brand new idol club in the face of student council disapproval. Sunshine, at least in its first season, distinguishes itself by having a consistent through line reinforcing its central theme. Nijigasaki flips the focus in favor of individual character episodes instead of any overall plot, and at least its school isn&#039;t in danger of dying for no good reason. In contrast, Superstar has little giving it its own identity.<br />
<br />
On its own, Superstar is serviceable if light on substance, and it has enough great scenes to demonstrate that someone on the staff really cared about the show, but they&#039;re always fighting against the show&#039;s refusal to take a step outside the boundaries of past successes. Taken in the context of the franchise, it has little innovation to offer. Newcomers to Love Live will have no issues enjoying the series, and super fans don&#039;t need a second opinion. For everyone else though, it&#039;s more or less skippable.

    So, I would like to reviews this in 2 ways: for new fans first watching and for old fans of the franchise.<br />
<br />
First, for new fans: the overall score would be around 8+/10.<br />
The story is nothing too special, but it makes good use of the characters to tell a charming story. Also, the story is a standalone so you don&#039;t have to watch other series of the franchise to enjoy it 100%. Moving on, the characters themselves are pretty diverse and relatable, and watching them interact is very fun, amusing and heartwarming! <br />
<br />
Now, as an anime about idol, the important thing here is the music and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review417488">
        the art. And lemme tell you, Superstar!! really aces both of that. The art is clean but still unique, and the songs are great! Even though I don&#039;t like an insert song, I can&#039;t deny the opening and ending songs are amazing, as they capture the feeling of the show perfectly!!<br />
<br />
So, overall, the anime is pretty enjoyable and anyone can enjoy it, as long as they don&#039;t hate anime idol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, for the old fans: 10000000/10<br />
<br />
Holy f*ck guys the show is amazing, stellar even!!! You should definitely watch it now if you enjoy the original series and love µ&#039;s. Seriously, I mean it.<br />
<br />
At first, I had my doubt about whether or not this will live up to the Love Live legacy, as it only stars 5 characters instead of 9 like other series. I am glad to say that I no longer doubt it. They&#039;re all so charming in their own ways, and fit together seamlessly, they&#039;re absolutely amazing as a group!<br />
<br />
Also, having only 5 members mean that they have more time to explore each members more, and it&#039;s really great because it gives the characters more depth and make them more relatable.<br />
<br />
Imo, the story and the characters are the perfect mix between School Idol Project and Sunshine. They feel real, and yet they still have that small supernatural/unrealistic thingy that the original series had. To quote someone else&#039;s comments &quot;A LL anime that have people dancing in the street is a good LL anime&quot; lol. Furthermore, the funny moments are perfectly balanced with the more dramatic and emotional scenes.<br />
<br />
About the art and sound... <br />
Art: it&#039;s much &quot;cleaner&quot; than the original art, but still retains that &quot;Love Live&quot;-ness that makes it unique. Also the 3D model are much better now!<br />
<br />
Sound: the only reason I gave it a 9 is because I&#039;m a picky listener, I don&#039;t like an insert song. But overall, the music is marvelous/すばらし！！  I&#039;m not sure why but I feel nostalgic listening to the opening and ending songs. (Also, Kanon songs in ep1 made me cry)<br />
<br />
Overall, it&#039;s an outstanding show in the franchise, so do yourself a favor and watch it!!!!

    This anime is surely great and can be an option to start the franchise.<br />
Not about winning after the struggle like Muse [School Idol Project], not a depressing story like Aqours [Sunshine!], nor Nijigasaki who has tons of member which truly represents a school club. Superstar is different, more like slice of life-ish idol story with only 5 members in it. That&#039;s what I thought when watching this show for like the first half season (?)<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s talk about this first half that I was excited for. First thing you will notice is how good Sayurin&#039;s [Date Sayuri] voice when singing. The anime will let you listen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421436">
        to her singing at the very beginning of the first episode. More like &#039;Beautiful&#039;, rather than &#039;Unique&#039; like how Love Live! characters always supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Again the protagonist comes with orange-ish color (tho I don&#039;t recognize Ayumu as protagonist from Nijigasaki since the other members also gained the same spotlight). Kanon is a girl who love singing so much but something won&#039;t allow her to exploit her potential. It reminds me on how Muse told us that it&#039;s hard to be an idol who have to keep smiling while singing and dancing.<br />
<br />
How they recruit new members is also amazing. Sumire with her ego, Chisato with her promise, and best of all, Ren with her past. I even cried in Chisato and Ren&#039;s case. Something new that I didn&#039;t get after Sunshine! ends. Soma Ria from Golden Loveriche once said that it&#039;s too common to use dead people as tearjerking matrerial. Sunrise can easily get out of the box thinking about this.<br />
<br />
But the amazement on the story dimmed right after Ren joined the club. The drama feels rushed and half-heartedly written only to reach 12 episodes target. Yea, I admit that the story is not that bad, just the pace that is not right for me. It&#039;s just too fast even at the end of 12th episode I asked myself, &quot;oh, it&#039;s ended already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, critical pace problem can be covered with great insert songs. Nonfiction as example of insert song in 10th episode. They use rap as central point of the song. I was like, what the hell they&#039;re going to do. And when it showed right in front of my eyes, it ended to become one of my favorite. In twelfth episode, a scene will remind you to Muse.<br />
<br />
Post-credit&#039;s Liella no Uta also my biggest point on why I always waiting for this show every week. Drawn in unique artstyle, combined with pretty good song, it just relaxing. Ah, FYI, Liella no Uta in 6th episode makes me fell in love with Paychan&#039;s [Naomi Payton] voice.

    Love Live Superstar is a wonderful surprise. It may be easy to look at it and see the same theme of a group of girls becoming school idols as they sing, dance, write songs and develop a strong bond with each other and dismiss it as the same old thing. But by doing so would not only be a disservice to yourself, but this anime.<br />
<br />
After watching the highly enjoyable Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, I was feening for more. It felt like a long and simultaneously short time for Superstar to arrive, and am I glad it did. If I ever needed a reminder of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421380">
        why I love the Love Live franchise so much (to the point that my siblings teasingly ask me when I&#039;m watching an anime, &quot;Does this one have to do with a group of girls making a band?&quot;) this is it. Superstar encapsulates all of the series&#039; strongest elements and with a few tweaks and new facets of simplicity, I can safely say I find this to be the greatest Love Live ever created so far. Yes, even surpassing the original.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, Superstar is a joy to watch, literally. Everything looks so polished. The character designs stand out, the CG dancing has improved, and even the backgrounds are given careful detail. Whether it&#039;s the streets of Kanon&#039;s neighbourhood, the architecture of Sumire’s shrine or the surroundings of the school itself, every place is vibrant with colour and has a warm, inviting feel to it. The animation feels so alive too whether it’s the girls dancing or one of them simply writing something on a board and it inevitably ends up looking pretty. I was particularly impressed with the girls’ performance when Sumire was chosen as the center, that’s an example of crisp and fluid animation.<br />
<br />
Visuals alone won’t be enough to carry an anime, of course. There’s an immediate and welcome change of formula in the form of the main protagonist, Kanon. Rather than a big ball of joy like Honoka or Chika, Kanon comes off as a highly relatable teenager. That’s not me knocking the other two characters or saying they’re not relatable by the way. I consider myself an optimistic idealist/idealistic optimist so I find them quite endearing even though I’m aware that kind of energy is incredibly rare. Anyway, what I’m saying with Kanon is that she sees herself as an ordinary person with no particular skills or aspirations, and she’s seen in the beginning spending a good amount of time struggling with her insecurities. She’s shy, sarcastic, she gets flustered and has mood swings, but she obviously has an interest for music which makes her a shoo-in for the main character for this kind of anime. It’s interesting to note that in one episode, she’s trying to get through a song, and that same song ends up being the ED. Just little things like this is one of the reasons I’ll always hold Love Live in high regard.<br />
<br />
I’ve found it incredible how Love Live manages to have a large cast of characters, but somehow is able to give each of them development and screen time, to the point that while I’ll always have a favourite or “best girl”, I still appreciate everyone else too. Another change with Superstar is it cuts the number of the main cast in half from nine or ten, to five. Does this work to its advantage? I believe so. Just because there are fewer in number doesn’t guarantee they’ll all have their characters fleshed out in a meaningful way. Thankfully, they do though as each of the girls is given the spotlight to show why they matter and why you should care. <br />
<br />
A shining example of this is Ren’s episodes. One constant in Love Live is the student council president showing dislike for idols or anything relating to it at the school. While she might come off as mean and cold at the start, it’s later shown there’s a deeper reason for her opposition. While I can appreciate the previous girls’ concern, Ren’s reason hits way closer to home. The reveal of her complicated and downright depressing family life made me interested in her thoughts and motivations. Maybe it’s because losing a loved one has happened multiple times in my own life as much as I hate to admit it, but Ren’s story makes a lot of sense and at the end, I was genuinely happy for her through my teary eyes. If her character was given something similar to work with, she would’ve felt similar to the other Love Live student council presidents. But with this she has earned her place as not only being relatable, but a stand out character. <br />
<br />
Other than Ren, my personal favourite would have to be Sumire. She’s quirky, over-the-top, charismatic, and is as cute as a bug’s ear. While she tries to portray herself as some superstar, deep down, she’s a big softie with an inferiority complex. She also has a surprising amount of depth to her. She constantly wants to be the center of attention or take on the main role when she was in show business, yet she was consistently put in minor or background roles instead. Due to her taking so many L’s, she became terrified of failure and starved for validation. A good amount of the humour comes from her too (usually at her expense). The episodes that revolve around her are well-written and it’s easy to understand what part of the group she plays and how she operates as an individual. Galaxy!~ <br />
<br />
Like I said before, when it comes to Love Live, I end up liking each character so with this being the fourth series, that’s a given at this point. Every girl here will have her fans and she definitely deserves every single one of them. There’s a character here for everyone to relate to and cheer on. Another change which is a bit more subtle is that all of the girls are first year students. What I get out of that is that we could end up seeing all of them growing up together for three full years! This dynamic makes things exciting for any future seasons. <br />
<br />
The last thing I’d like to bring up about them is their group name: Liella. It’s a combination of French and Spanish words, namely lier and brillante, respectively. Lier means to bind or connect, and brillante means to shine. So they’re going to connect you with their music. It might seem like a small thing to bring up, but if you ask me, this is the best sounding and most meaningful name so thanks to everyone who voted on Dengenki G’s magazine online poll for making it happen. <br />
<br />
Despite all my praise, there is one aspect I wish was expanded more on and that’s the rivalry with Sunny Passion. It’s not like they have to be at each other’s throat or anything like that. But even though they’re portrayed as an accomplished duo in their own right, their presence wasn’t as impactful for me. Maybe they can be better explained in another season and I definitely would look forward to it, but as of right now, they don’t do much for me. <br />
<br />
Still, Love Live Superstar is an experience. It’s one of the most fun I’ve had watching an anime for quite some time. Even if you’ve never watched a Love Live before, but are a slice of life fan, then this is worth a watch. Or maybe you have, but for one reason or another haven’t dug deeper. I would strongly suggest you give Superstar a chance as it’s on a completely different level. It’s not just an anime for Love Live fans, idol fans, slice of life fans, or music fans, but a gift to all of them.<br />
<br />
Again, this is the best Love Live offering as of today. The visuals and animation are by far the best. The music is the catchiest it’s ever been. The characters are all compelling. The humour is incredibly on point. Man, the poignant moments are guaranteed to crank the water works. <br />
<br />
Even if another season never gets made, this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best slice of life and idol anime out there.

    Love Live! Superstar!! is the fourth entry in the Love Live franchise, and as such, I was expecting that they might have started to run out of ideas. Luckily, that turned out not to be the case. This is the first Love Live! series to get its main run as a prime time broadcast, and I really felt all the special care and little details that went into making this a success. While Love Live! has always been fairly solid, Superstar not only lives up to the standard, but perhaps even surpasses its predecessors.<br />
<br />
Even though it is part of a franchise, it is worth mentioning

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421315">
        that it&#039;s not necessary to have seen or finished any other Love Live! series to enjoy this one, as the setting is original. If you have seen any of the others the premise is more or less the same, but with a smaller main cast, prettier visuals, and it takes a more wholesome approach with less of the fanservicey humour.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#039;t talk about this series without first mentioning the music, and it is both emotional and catchy. The opening (Start!! True Dreams) and ending (Miraiwa kaze no youni) themes are both instantly memorable, but the insert songs for the live performances are what really got my tears flowing. The visuals for the live performances are incredible too. Both the stages and outfits are cute with a lot of little details you&#039;ll need to pause to notice, the camera effects are magical, and they&#039;re all animated in a higher frame rate, which really brings the dancing to life. <br />
<br />
And regarding visuals, the characters are cute and expressive and really captured my heart, but one other thing that really stood out was the highly detailed backgrounds. The character designs are lovely as always, but the backgrounds here take it further and really bring the places to life. This is the sort of series for which I love posting screencaps, just to show how charming it is.<br />
<br />
As with other Love Live! series, the story revolves around a &quot;school idol&quot; club at a high school, but without giving too much away, the thematic focus of Superstar is confronting anxieties. As someone who has often felt anxious, this resonated with me deeply and made me feel encouraged to do my best. Nothing comes to our main characters easily, which makes it all the more satisfying when they do succeed, and when they fail but become even more determined to keep going.<br />
<br />
Overall, this has been my favourite Love Live! series to date, and I recommend it very much whether you&#039;re a new fan or an old one.

    With this being the third anime installment in the Love Live! saga (not includng Nijigasaki which is a separate entity), Superstar!! had a lot of pressure among the larger LL community to live up to expectations that would recreate a familiar formula while also providing something new to entice the fans.<br />
<br />
So far, it&#039;s largely succeeded in that goal.<br />
<br />
<br />
While there&#039;s much that can be said about Superstar!! in regards to its plot, which while deviating in major ways compared to its predecessors still retains a common structure to School Idol Project and Sunshine!!, what sold this show to me to get this high of a rating

          <span style="display: none;" id="review414606">
        has been the characters and their dynamic with one another thus far.<br />
<br />
As opposed to both μ&#039;s and Aqours (as well as Nijigaku), Liella, the idol group in this anime, only composes of five members in contrast to the usual nine. This opens the possibility of closer and perhaps more realistic character interactions that viewers were unable to fully grasp in the previous installments. With how the characters have interacted with each other so far in this show, this seems to be the likely route the show will take.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day though, Love Live! at its core is a music anime, and wow does Superstar!! deliver in this category. While in the insert songs have been great, the true musical aspect of Superstar!! that it shares with his predecessors has been the original soundtrack, that captures the themes of excitement, hardship, and love that this story will tell.<br />
<br />
Even if you&#039;re not a diehard fan of Love Live! or haven&#039;t caught up with all that the franchise has to offer, I would strongly recommend giving Love Live! Superstar!! a watch so long as you&#039;re interested in a compelling story or relatable characters wanting to achieve their dreams. For those who are among the Love Live! community that have decided to give Superstar!! a skip, I implore you to give it a chance, as it provides a new story and opens up new possibilities that μ&#039;s, Aqours, and Nijigaku were unable to explore.<br />
<br />
Overall, a 10/10 for Love Live! Superstar!!<br />

    This is such a refreshing anime from Love Live franchise. For you who doesn&#039;t know, we usually get a lot of main character in the anime. But this one is different, there are only 5 MC here. And because of that, every character can have their development perfectly and didn&#039;t look rushed. I&#039;m not saying all the previous anime is bad, it just feels something different.<br />
<br />
Story 10/10<br />
As always, even though Love Live Superstar is a music anime doesn&#039;t mean they throw off the story. The story is also as amazing as their music. Heartwarming and sometimes emotional, the story is a mix beetween those two.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review422790">
        How they create their own school idol, how they recruit their member, how they make their music. It all packed perfectly. Not only that, this anime also has a laughable moment. Those make all the things balanced, beetween sad and funny.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
Gorgeus, pretty, beautiful. All that combine and you got this artsyle. What i really like from this is the atmosphere/mood we got from it. It hard to explain but you know, like when there is a specific scene whether it sad or happy. They can bring it to us viewer. So it feels like we are there ourself, see it with our own eyes. Yes its kinda weird, but try to watch it and experience it yourself. Also don&#039;t forget that when they perform on stage its always beautiful. Their choreography is smooth as hell.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
I love all the song here. The ED song, OP song, insert song. In fact some of them are in my playlist. Especially the one that play at the end of episode. Their voice is soothing and relaxing. Its so comfortable listening to their song when i&#039;m alone in my room. Their voice is also fits perfectly. And for the SFX, its all sound so natural. I didn&#039;t hear anything weird.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
They manage to nail all the characters personality really good. They only have 5 MC and i love it. Because of that we can have more episode of them deepening their bond with each other. For comparison, previous Love Live anime need a 2nd season to do that. And this one doesn&#039;t. And for the side characters. They didn&#039;t throw them off and instead giving them a really big role in the anime helping the MC.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
This is the first airing Love Live series i watch and it really satisfying to finally finish it. Even though i just finished it, i&#039;m already craving for 2nd season which is just confirmed not long ago. I reccomend you to watch all previous Love Live anime (if you haven&#039;t) while waiting for 2nd season. Also i will definitely rewatch this series in dub when they are coming out.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, should you watch it? Definitely. If i am not a Love Live fans and watch this anime, i will be one. This anime have something special in it that will drag you into idol hell. When you go into idol hell, you can&#039;t come back. But for real tho, come on join us. Whether its on Discord, Twitter, Reddit, the community is all good. At least thats what i see.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review

    Well I&#039;m starting this review by saying that I used to be a huge fan of this franchise and series.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I have to say that Love Live Superstar has to be the most wasted Love Live yet. Most of my struggles with this series are about how they mishandled so many situations, Love Live is also known for having some musical moments that will melt your heart, but aside of the animation (that we know that it only gets better and better), none of the performances transmitted anything to me really, I would only rescue one (which I will not say because

          <span style="display: none;" id="review421999">
        I&#039;m not gonna make spoilers) but it&#039;s kinda forgettable tho.<br />
<br />
The problems that girls face are very redundant and some of them don&#039;t make sense in my opinion (I feel that there&#039;re contradictions throughout the series), actually in previous installments of Love Live, the series has been able to handle a bigger number of girls and showing different facets of them, and ALSO transmitting their emotions in a single chapter, something that Superstar is not capable of executing correctly since most conflicts are not taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Going to the humor and charisma section, in this series, I also find nothing outstanding compared to the previous installments, in fact, in Superstar I feel that the &quot;funny scenes&quot; are less effective most of the time.<br />
<br />
I think Love Live Superstar it&#039;s ok if your looking for an anime that you can kill time with, but at the same time it&#039;s very mediocre in many ways, and it&#039;s one of the most forgettable Love Lives to date in my opinion.<br />
<br />
PS: Sumire has the best episode imo
