I love Kuroko no Basket, a lot, it&#039;s had a large personal effect on my life, and I&#039;ve been waiting for the past 2 years for this movie as my most anticipated piece of media. I knew everything that would happen as I have read the manga previously, so this movie delivering what I want was more a question of adaptation than a question of the content itself. Considering that they decide to show The Last Game in movie format, time constraints were definitely one of my concerns, especially since the manga was extremely text heavy and was being published monthly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258225">
        but The Last Game delivered me the perfect last hurrah for the franchise that leaves me more content than even the TV series ending which I thought was stellar.<br />
<br />
The art of The Last Game is slightly different than the TV series with less notable shading and a lighter color palette, character designs look a lot sleeker and a lot of the Generation of Miracles members have had subtle changes to their appearances like Murasakibara&#039;s even longer hair or Midorima&#039;s combover. The visual effects for this movie are fantastic, usage of &quot;The Zone&quot; and &quot;Perfect Copy&quot; have never looked so crisp and a lot of the plays that are used are animated brilliantly. There are some still frames present, but these are edited well enough that they do not become an issue. There are a lot of dynamic camera angles used especially when it comes to high level plays, characters&#039; bodies move especially fluid when they are doing streetball like maneuvers. <br />
<br />
Sound in The Last Game is stellar, the traditional blend of electric and metal in the OST from the series stays strong bringing pure tension to every scene. The sound mixing is great, as there are certain moments like when they zoom in on Midorima&#039;s remote or whenever Akashi or Nash use the Emperor/Belial Eye that fit perfectly. The insert songs by Granrodeo and Kensho Ono (especially the latter) are in sync perfectly with the action on screen, Kensho Ono&#039;s &quot;Against The Wind&quot; might be one of the most tonally relevant insert songs I&#039;ve ever heard. However the best thing about this movie by far is the voice performances. Huge props to all of the Seiyuu&#039;s who voice the Generation of Miracles but specific props to Jason Silver&#039;s awesomely hammy performance as well as Hiroshi Kamiya for displaying Akashi&#039;s struggle with his identity and his weaknesses as a leader and overcoming that all in the span of the film. Also the Engrish is fucking hilarious, classic KnB Engrish.<br />
<br />
The plot is pretty basic, a foreign team steamroll the D Team and basically disrespect the entire Japanese race and their athletic ability. I don&#039;t think characters could be any more racist, basic or agenda driven than Jabberwock. But that&#039;s what makes them so easily detestable, I fucking HATE all of them, especially Nash and Nash&#039;s competence on the court and ability as a captain on par with Akashi just makes his horribleness even more infuriating. But this film is not about Jabberwock, it never was. This movie is a love letter to Kagami and The Generation of Miracles. Each of them gets adequate screentime and it truly feels like that nobody got shafted in this film which is something I thought the manga didn&#039;t do correctly as I was visably mad at Kagami and Aomine&#039;s misuse in the Extra Game manga but the get plenty of shine here. Kise and Akashi get major focus in this game and honestly although everyone held their own, they are by far the MVPs of this game. The fact that there was also less focus on isolation play and every single character was assisting others showed that the Generation of Miracles has grown, because they stopped operating as a team when they were at Teiko. <br />
<br />
Aside from the game itself, I think the buildup and the ending were also substantial and necessary. Although I think 20 minutes for the introduction to Jabberwock was not necessary and it could have been done in less time, however there was never a point where I wanted to speed up the film to get to &quot;the good stuff&quot;. The ending is sort of open and emotionally wrenching, I gave a spoiler warning but I absolutely do not want to spoil this ending, but it was bittersweet but still absolutely perfect.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s been a long wait to see this movie, but after watching it I can confirm that Kuroko no Basket: The Last Game is everything I hoped it would be and more.

    Last Game is a failure of a finale to the series.<br />
<br />
Just to get it out of the way: it&#039;s fair to call it a finale because it calls itself last game, as opposed to its manga counterpart that just called itself extra game, which was much more harder to be harsh on it for that reason.<br />
<br />
The best part of the movie was seeing how the Generation of Miracles were no longer bloodthirsty psychopaths who&#039;d stab someone with scissors. Seeing them as normal, chill teens was pretty refreshing. Them having retconned Kagami wanting to be an NBA player is also an appreciated touch, it filled in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260468">
        the whole of none of them having any clear goal beyond just becoming really good high school basketball players that the series had for its entire run, and because of it, it also gave some of the other characters goals too. Sadly, the same can&#039;t be said about the other aspects of the movie.<br />
<br />
The villains are definitely the worst part. Seeing as fans of the series are used to asshole antagonists who just talk about how no one can stop them and how they wish a proper challenger would show up, it&#039;s probably not that hard to be lenient towards them at first, but it slowly becomes apparent that there won&#039;t be much to them as it goes on. Gold and Silva don&#039;t get any moment where we see what shaped their beliefs and attitude and they don&#039;t get any kind of character arc by the end either, they don&#039;t have any nuance or depth to them, they only exist to get beaten down. It&#039;s quite ironic, really, for a series whose whole point was about showing disillusioned teens the fun of basketball and teaching them to not be stuck-up pricks, the final villains end up being exactly that and don&#039;t even get the same kind of treatment the show prided itself on being about.<br />
<br />
For an anime tie-in movie, it somehow managed to look exactly like and sometimes worse than the tv show. Other than the parts featuring hyper-realistic animation early on during the 2nd match, which had very weird camera angles and felt less explosive compared to some of the more well-known cuts from the main series, the movie kept using its usual technique of still frames and close-ups .<br />
<br />
It really just felt like a cashgrab rather than a fulfilling epilogue, all things considered.<br />
<br />
also no meteor jam D:

    Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.<br />
---<br />
True to the title it is about having one more game and what better way to do it then with the ultimate dream team.<br />
<br />
Watched this in SM cinema Cebu, Philippines on 5/23/17. <br />
<br />
The best streetball team in the world who are from America have come to Japan for an exhibition match and decimated their opponent and have insulted all of Japan&#039;s basketball players. In retaliation a coach decided to gather the generation of miracles featuring Kagami and a few benchwarmers to slay the Jabberwock team.<br />
<br />
The opposing team keeps getting surprised by the level of talent the Vorpal Swords displays

          <span style="display: none;" id="review248338">
        but that doesn&#039;t mean that they themselves don&#039;t have their own abilities to counter even the almighty zone. Ability after ability, skill after skill and even an eye for an eye the game continues with each shot, dribble, pass, block, steal, rebound and sweat being countered at every turn.<br />
<br />
Eventually the generation of miracles would use new abilities to counter the malevolent force of their enemies. From using multiple zones, zone technique combos, natural ability fusing, reawakenings and even old tricks just to get an edge over the opposition. The last game truly has alot of show off as a final sendoff. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately not everyone goes into a zone here and there&#039;s also no 5 man zone present but it is still fun regardless of my personal disappointments. We also get to see one guy finally going 100% full power despite not going into zone.<br />
<br />
It just goes to show that basketball is a truly fun game where even the most ridiculous of shots can go in. My personal motto in basketball is &quot;No matter how perfect the form of your shot is, it is never 100% guaranteed while no matter how ridiculous or far your shot is, it is never a true 0% probability&quot;. So while Kuroko&#039;s basketball maybe full of unbelievable powers it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not impossible for anyone. Though the consistency of theirs is where the true question of improbability lies. I myself personally am similar to Aomine since I do circus shots that amaze people with the consistency and even the level of ridiculous range and poses, like a 3-point skyhook now and then.<br />
<br />
It also shows how far they have to reach if they ever want to play again on an international stage, especially if any of them ever want to aim for the NBA. Which is of course the aim of Kagami.<br />
<br />
So give it a go and don&#039;t forget to stay and watch after the credits rolled for an extra farewell scene.

    So I watched this a month or two ago and decided to write a review for this. I missed the beginning of it as I was late for the movie. When I arrived at the cinema, they were already finishing the first of the 4 quarters of the game so I&#039;ll give my review based on that. <br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Fairly interesting. Shows you the difficulties that the Generation of Miracles faced while they were going against Jabberwock, just like what you normally see in the seasons of Kuroko no Basuke where they were up against different schools in tournaments. Combining abilities and coming up with new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review250974">
        strategies to counter their enemy, etc. <br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
They changed their art style in the movie compared to the anime which made me sad. I didn&#039;t like the art style because they looked so different. It looks so off for me but the animation followed the manga so I cannot really complain about it.<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
Nothing much to say. There are exciting scenes but it just shows them working together to overcome the challenges they&#039;re facing and then things about their abilities which you already know in the anime. They did not focus much on the other characters except The Generation of Miracles.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment/Overall: 8<br />
I enjoyed the movie and definitely worth it to watch as it shows most of them going into the zone and working together as team with great scenes. Also, the ending after the credits made me kind of sad and makes you wonder about things for Kagami and Kuroko in the future.

    So here we are again with another Kuroko no Basket adaption. Anyone coming from the previous instalments will know just how good this show is. However, I heard a lot of criticism with it not being &quot;Street Basketball&quot; like the manga. Let me be straight here. I don&#039;t think it had that much of an effect on my enjoyment. They stuck to the manga material pretty well and only changed up a few things (Not being played outside being the main).<br />
<br />
That being said I&#039;m completely cool with this. I feel like it connects to the previous seasons a lot better. Needless to say, the unrealistic

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258129">
        shots became so much more unrealistic. Not that it&#039;s a bad thing. In fact, it makes it so much more enjoyable by making it much harder to anticipate the moves they are going to perform. <br />
<br />
Starting off with the entertainment value. Kuroko no Basket: Last Game brings back all the classic moves we have seen in previous seasons, slam dunks, phantom shots the whole shebang. Except that&#039;s not all. Last Game takes it a step further by evolving our much-beloved characters right before our eyes. Furthermore, it gives us the much-anticipated team up. Bringing all the Generation of Miracles back together for one final game. I mean what more could we want? Ah, that&#039;s right them actually working together instead of a solo victory. Let me tell you. The satisfaction and joy you feel when all these characters work together again are beyond words. I found myself with a grin on my face the whole movie. Anyone who has watched the previous seasons will probably get a similar reaction. Not to mention the amazing Engrish that is spoken in the anime. It really adds a sense of humour to it and keeps things interesting. So overall, I would give the entertainment value a 10/10.<br />
<br />
Moving onto the story. It brings us back just after the Winter Games have finished. When the Generation of Miracles come across a new threat that doesn&#039;t just threaten them but the hole of Japanese basketball. Finally, our ultimate dream team has been formed to &quot;mop the floor&quot; with these newly found opponents. Like the previous seasons, the story follows Kuroko showing us more and more his way of playing basketball. Now with Kuroko, Kagami and the Generation of Miracles ready to fight. How can you expect them to lose? That&#039;s the kicker. These newly found opponents are beyond strong. Not only being the age of 18 they are on the same level as some NBA players. Forcing our much-beloved team to evolve even further. Throwing in some tear-jerking scenes as well as the great happiness you get from watching the story unfold. Overall, I would say the story was really well put together and follows the manga and previous seasons really well. However, some things just didn&#039;t sit comfortably with me and found it a bit dull at times. So because of this, I&#039;m rating 8/10 for the story.<br />
 <br />
Let me be frank. The art was phenomenal. Especially the amount of detail that went into things like Kuroko&#039;s Ignite Pass. Not to mention when they enter the zone. The art style is very fluid so you can really see just how much the players are moving around in the match. However, I didn&#039;t like how much the art style changed the characters looks. Specifically the Generation of Miracles. You can really tell the difference. Although it makes up for this with the amazing amount of detail that went into the environment around the characters. Commonly what you would expect from a movie&#039;s budget. Overall I would rate the art a 9/10 simply because of the issues with the characters otherwise I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to bump it up to a 10. <br />
<br />
As for the sound. This was probably one of the only things I was disappointed about. It really lowers down the quality in my opinion. There are a few good scenes where it sounds really good. However, for the most part, I felt the music was a bit dull and was just typical background music. Nothing that gets you really hyped. The exceptions being things like Akashi&#039;s theme. Sadly this lowered the quality of the film for me. I felt there were better soundtracks in the previous seasons. All of the other sound effects were amazing like the ball bouncing etc. So because of this, I&#039;m going to give it an 8/10.<br />
<br />
Moving onto the characters. it&#039;s just what you would expect after watching the previous seasons. Now that they all realise what it means to play for a team. Instead of themselves it really adds new aspects to the characters that weren&#039;t really touched upon in the previous seasons. It also does a good job of bringing back old and familiar characters while still making room to introduce some amazing new ones. We begin to see sides of these characters that we haven&#039;t seen before or at least not much of. Leading to some excellent character development. That you probably won&#039;t expect after 3 long seasons. It really begins to show just how much they all enjoy basketball and just how fun the sport really is. So because of this, I&#039;m giving the character development a 10/10. <br />
<br />
In short, Kuroko no Basket: Last Game is an entertaining anime to watch and most watch for any Kuroko no Basket fan. Keeping you thrilled throughout the movie.  Don&#039;t forget to watch till after the credits as there is an extra scene. If you made it this far reading my review.. thanks for reading. Feel free to add me if you want to comment on my review or discuss anything. <br />

    Kuroko no Basket: Last Game, an epic closing for the best basketball anime<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that the title blew the eyes of many fans of the best basketball manga, Slam Dunk. But I consider Kuroko no Basket anime better. However I&#039;m not writing this to talk about that. What I will do is talk about Kuroko no Basket: Last Game, the film that closes the franchise.<br />
 <br />
Last Game is the film adaptation of Extra Game, a small manga of 8 episodes that Tadatoshi Fujimaki wrote to give us a lot, but a lot of fanservice. It is no secret to anyone that if you love basketball as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review272688">
        a sport and also like anime, the idea of ​​a Dream Team with the characters of KnB is too tempting. And that&#039;s what Extra Game did and its adaptation, Last Game.<br />
<br />
A beast worth killing: Team Jabberwock<br />
<br />
<br />
The only way to organize a Dream Team in Kuroko no Basket is to present a rival that is worthy of it. In the manga and the film this rival is the fearsome street basketball team Team Jabberwock. As a curiosity, the team owes its name to Jabberwocky, a monster that appears in a poem by Lewis Carroll in his book Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There of 1871.<br />
<br />
This team, made up of American players between 18 and 20 years old, is the champion in their country of origin. A kind of Harlem Globetrotters of street basketball. Its members have a level similar to that of the NBA, which is already a challenge. But two of them, Nash Gold Jr. and Jason Silver, have the Dream Team level of the USA.<br />
 <br />
Upon arrival in Japan for an exhibition game, they beat and humiliate their rivals, Team Strky, by an overwhelming score of 86-6. This team is made up of university players that were part of the original KnB manga. These are Kasamatsu (former member of Kaijou), Miyaji (former member of Shutoku), Imayoshi (former member of Toho), Okamura (former member of Yousen) and Higuchi (former member of Rakuzan).<br />
<br />
Yes, each one was an ex partner of a member of the Generation of Miracles.<br />
<br />
But not content to give them a crushing beating in the game, Jabberwock members scoffed at Japanese basketball and called monkeys Japanese athletes. This blew up Aida Kagetora, one of the promoters of the match, who challenged them to a rematch in a week.<br />
<br />
Who will kill the beast? The Vorpal Swords Team, a group integrated by The Generation of Miracles plus Kuroko and Kagami. Well, and three substitutes who do not see a minute of play.<br />
<br />
The fanservice is served, let the game begin.<br />
<br />
Kuroko no Basket: Last Game appeals to all its strengths<br />
<br />
<br />
As an anime, Kuroko no Basket is characterized by elements that are already a hallmark of the house. The first is the sensational and dynamic animation, section in which Production I.G. It does not disappoint. Being a film released in cinemas, the level is still higher than that of the TV series.<br />
<br />
To that is added a palette of vibrant colors, which make this film a visual delight. The soundtrack resorts once more to electronic music and rock, is not particularly bright but helps to accentuate the action.<br />
<br />
With respect to the script, it is almost identical to that of Extra Game. The novelty is in the inclusion of a flashback of Kagami&#039;s past that serves as a link to the end, which is very different. The argument is simple, it is entirely focused on the duel between Vorpal Swords and Jabberwock.<br />
<br />
The game do not miss the moments of fanservice. Aomine and Kise doing a double team. Murasakibara really enjoying basketball. Kuroko giving invisible passes to his former teammates Teikou. Akashi and Midorima making the direct connection of the triples. The film has everything.<br />
<br />
For those who know basketball it is a delight to imagine the possible combinations of players on the board and Last Game does not disappoint. Yes, it&#039;s about KnB&#039;s super stylized basketball with sparks in the eyes reflecting the Zone or the absolutely fake Midorima triples, but it&#039;s still great.<br />
<br />
Kurono no Basket: Last Game was created for that purpose, to give us a sweet to the fans. But it does it with quality, and even manages to thrill with its end. In addition, it is allowed to create hype leaving the door open for the future. One where once again everyone is rivals and play the basketball they love, as many times as they want.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
<br />
Its 90 minutes pass very quickly thanks to the great rhythm that takes both animation and editing. The only real downside that the movie can have is not spending a little more time on training before the game, but it is a minor sin.<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of KnB this film, released in March 2017, is an obligation. And if you&#039;re not because you love Slam Dunk, give it a try, you might have fun. It is a sports anime film more than competent without real weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Understanding that I am evaluating it as a sports anime and also, as an epilogue to a long manga, I give it a 9/10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
Kuroko no Basket: Last Game is a worthy epilogue to this popular sports manga and anime.<br />

    Last game. So much hype was around this title, I was excited to watch this but then I realized... Disappointment<br />
<br />
Story (6/10): Well it&#039;s hard to rate story for sport anime. It&#039;s even more difficult to make a good one. All 3 seasons of &quot;Kuroko no Basuke&quot; had some of its own charms, but a film falls a bit short. Viewers get the point of the bad team that has to be slain, but it&#039;s missing their reason to play so. *SPOILER ALERT* Like why Silver refers to himself as the &quot;Almighty Me&quot;? Or Nash calling everyone a monkey? Jabberwock just came from America. Like everyone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review260116">
        street basketball player behave themselves so. *SPOILER ENDS*<br />
<br />
Art/Sound (7/10): As good as it can get. Art and sound carries the whole film. Same goes for anime. The picture is nice to watch, frames follow each other without sudden shifts in the plan. Nothing bad to say.<br />
<br />
Characters (3/10): Well here it comes. GOM is good, but that&#039;s all. Each member of Vorpal Swords was already revealed in anime. Last game shows that some of them have changed and become better team members, especially in one team. But Jabberwock isn&#039;t revealed at all. We get only 2 members that are dangerous in game, really dangerous, and other 3. Other 3 is what makes a failure in character description. I watched film yesterday. You think I remember their names, don&#039;t you? Well no. Didn&#039;t even knew them until visit wiki. Authors tell us that they are good at basketball and they are mean. And this is only because they are Americans. Yep, that&#039;s it. It feels strange for a whole film about that team to lose 3 of its intentional members to be lost in the shine of Silver and Gold.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6/10): Although, this film is enjoying. On the moments of block, dribbling, shots and pathos phrases you really feel that you want to grab that ball go outside and play basketball. Jokes include. You will be happy with that film if you are a fan of series, but as a raw expert - some of the tricks make you feel cringy, some faces too. Pure fair fun.<br />
<br />
Overall (5/10): I expected much more from LAST GAME. It&#039;s would be good as a continuation of other series, not Kuroko. As it was said, so much hype, but nothing inside. Can be compared to Call of Duty: another part of smth very good, but without much changes. Same good art, same quality of sound, but we need smth new. Stop repeating same things.<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t read the manga, I&#039;m not a huge fan of this series, reading other reviews made me watch the film, and a film made me write my own. I wouldn&#039;t recommend you watching this if you don&#039;t want to screw up your impression of anime, but if you love it so great that you bought all statues of GOM, definitely excellent choice.

    Putting an end to the story can be difficult if the tale in question does not have a specific goal or &quot;output&quot;, in which case there may be an emphasis on key events in the series and memories related to the protagonists. Quite frankly, this method is not always the right approach to the end of the story, but in the case of “Last Game” it works perfectly.<br />
<br />
I admit myself as a fan of the sports genre, especially basketball, because I know him very well, but I have always been very skeptical about the Kuroko no basket series and I do not consider it a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273215">
        good representative of the sports genre, moreover, I negatively perceive the existence of special abilities in &quot;Generation of Miracles&quot; in the series, although I watched her throughout her release.<br />
<br />
I can hardly be called even a close admirer of this series, but despite the disapproving look at it, “Last Game” surprised me very much. Perhaps it is mostly because of a little nostalgia, because the series itself came out quite a long time ago, since 2012 and in memory there are mostly good memories coming out, well, apparently, the person is so arranged that he remembers mostly only good things.<br />
<br />
So, the film begins with the fact that the American basketball team &quot;Jabberwock&quot; arrives in Japan, which believes that &quot;In basketball, the weak is not the place.&quot; Having played in a friendly match against one of the local teams and won an unquestionable victory, members of the American team began to mock the basketball players of this country. They decided that in Japan no one can play basketball. After this, all representatives of the &quot;Generation of Miracles&quot; gather to prove to basketball players from America that in Japan basketball is not worse.<br />
<br />
It is worth confess that Kuroko no Basket could always well demonstrated what happens in the game on the court, mostly thanks to beautiful animation, good music and eccentric-looking characters. But he always sagged in terms of history, the motivation of the characters and the development of the characters in particular, however, in the final film, in terms of character, the protagonists finally turned out to be worthy.<br />
<br />
Pleases that they released specifically the film, this favorably affects the format of the narrative, because thanks to this you can &quot;omit&quot; some of the moments and others things show in brief, the series always had a good beginning, but later it was exhausted throughout the episodes, in the film it&#039;s completely different, it&#039;s interesting to watch him, for the most part because of the fact that we have a whole picture and nothing breaks out from the context of the narrative.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that 90% of the film is a game between the two teams, because of this that the characters turned out to be quite satisfactory. Of course, we are watching the finale of the series, so you need to put a kind of a point in the characters , but it&#039;s always nice that let&#039;s say a rather frivolous and simple-minded guy took the right and optimal decision for the team at the moment, which you do not expect from him. But it is also noticeable how one comes to his inner ideal, such as Akashi Seijuurou, who was able to finally get rid of his alter ego and become &quot;himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound and music are chosen very well, as before. The voices of the characters correspond to their appearance and are perfectly suited. And the moment when on the background begins to play &quot;Against The Wind&quot; almost makes me start a stingy tear, but again this is mostly because of nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Sadly, but to get the most pleasure of the movie, you need to be aware of all the events of the series and be familiar with all the characters for a long time. This is main minus of the film too much influence on it has the previous three seasons of the series. Also, if you be watch at the whole series at the present time, that is, first, the first, second, third seasons, and then the movie, you can not get all the emotions that it gives. Only those who have followed the franchise for years will be able to fully appreciate this film. <br />
<br />
For the most part, the creators managed to finish the series with dignity, and I believe that &quot;Last Game&quot; is the best thing that happened to Kuroko no Basket for 5 years of its existence. In fact, the film leaves a pleasant impression of itself, even to those who are skeptical of the franchise. Fans of Kuroko no Basket would probably enjoy ”Last Game” immensely.<br />

     It&#039;s rare for sport anime to have a perfect ending like this (personal opinion), usually others sport anime end with unsatisfied ending.<br />
<br />
The story is continuation of it series, have a high tension game, and what makes it more enjoyable is the dream team are formed (I think the name of that dream team is lame but funny, once again it&#039;s my personal opinion). Some character makes another development on their own, they become more powerfull to defeat the enemy.<br />
<br />
This movie art are still the same like series, special effect of &quot;zone&quot; are not too much and bring me a great sensation.<br />
<br />
unfortunately the last game

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318883">
        are not presented T_T<br />
<br />
The last part of this movie is touching and this&#039;s why I said perfect ending.

    I am not a fan of anime sports genre. It just not my taste. So I decided to watch the Kuroko no Basket series and in my surprise it is a great watch. It got me hooked from Season 1 to 3 and sometimes I got goosebumps when watching the series. Wait, I&#039;m reviewing the movie not the series. Lol. I just want you to know what I think about the series. Then I heard a movie is coming out last year and I got excited. Waiting for almost 5 months because in my country, they don&#039;t  release anime films in theaters and I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262631">
        got a fine copy. Sorry for the long intro let my review begin:<br />
<br />
First, the gameplay of basketball is awesome too just like the series. Nice game to watch it almost like a NBA Finals action anime version. The antagonist are pretty badass as well. They made the right call to challenge Japan&#039;s best high school basketball players, Generation of Miracles. And the awaiting match begins. While watching the Generation of Miracles together playing, I got the feels train and goosebumps at the same time. <br />
<br />
At the end, the feels!!!!!  I wish it could be longer or another series will form in their adult life as professional basketball players. Stop reading if you don&#039;t want to get spoiled. That&#039;s the end of my review.<br />
<br />

There is no Kuroko&#039;s Zone in this movie.<br />

As a huge fan of basketball and of the 3 seasons of knb, this movie was a huge disappointment. The story was super predictable and it wasn&#039;t that relatable to real life basketball. They discredit the spirit of streetball. Sure it&#039;s trying to make one player look really good, and they try to embarrass the opposing player, but irl street ball teams that are INVITED to other countries, are super nice. They have tons of fans all over and treat them all greatly since it&#039;s because of them that they are able to play ball for a living. Personally, it would have been a much

        better movie if it were more like a healthy competition game where both teams are trying to do the sport of basketball justice. No need to make the opponents such villains. This made things super unrelatable for me and made everything seemed forced.

    I watched this movie in cinema in my city, I am basically glad that a lot of anime movie was airing in Indonesia.<br />
<br />
The story is typically at the last arc of Kuroko no Basuke : Last game. but the story was getting twisted in the last, it&#039;s not appear on manga. <br />
<br />
Basically I don&#039;t know it is okay or not.But I guess the twist is something for making stronger Kuroko and Kagami&#039;s bond.<br />
<br />
But for game between Vorpal Sword vs Jabberwock was good, even there are some of really fast pace, because the format for this arc is movie. But for some of beginner (who is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review257759">
        basically not know Kuroko no Basuke, I asked my friend who don&#039;t watch Kuroko to watch this movie), they can catch the story.<br />
<br />
In the end, I am glad the author gave us the last arc for ending, which brings all the &quot;Kiseki no Seda&quot; as group<br />
<br />

    This is my first review and it had to be for the end of one of my favorite animes, i was finaly able to watch it and all the waiting was worth it.<br />
<br />
Kuroko no basket is fantastic, if you are a true fan of the franchise this movie is a must as it is the end of the journey. I will not give spoilers in the analisis tho:<br />
<br />
Story: (9) Not much to add in the story as a sport anime movie, GOM gets together to play a match against a famous street ball team, the hype is real tho as how youre getting more and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review258389">
        more into the match.<br />
<br />
Art: (10) Fantastic, the animation is top quality, the dunks, akashi´s dribble, aomine´s playstyle, zone, the characters, all was very well done, something really necesary to enjoy a sports anime.<br />
<br />
Sound: (8) Great music, Grandrodeo as the main band so thats cool, but the main problem is the horrible english that japanese speaks even whenmaking american characters voice, but thats not of importance, the music is according to the show, it motivates you to feel the enviroment of the match.<br />
<br />
Character: (10) As I ve always thinked, the characters are what makes KnB fantastic, when a series presents you of so many badass secondary characters that outshines the main characters you know the show has an amazing character development, plus we are able to see the GoM develop new abilitys and seeing them playing together gives a nostalgic, yet exciting vibe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (10) Im a KnB fan, the enjoyment was huge, the thing that every characters tend to shine in the movie and how they confront even more OP characters gives you an amazing vibe.<br />
<br />
Overall: (10) If you watched and enjoyed the anime or even liked the extra game manga, the movie is a must watch, Amazing animation, GoM playing together and the conclusion for a fantasic anime.

     Okay, I was not gonna give this movie a 10 until the last 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
 The game itself was good, but not as good as other KnB games. Plus, a game against reunion of Generation on Miracles should&#039;ve been much more advanced and on a totally different level, this one was not as exciting as it should have been. The  opponents&#039; characters were not interesting and rather like a mass.<br />
<br />
 However, the ending was very unexpected. Very hearttouching and hearbreaking. But this is such a right way to end this anime. Kagami really did not belong to this place, that&#039;s what I was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review261244">
        thinking about throughout the whole series, and it all just finished the story.<br />
<br />
I still hope KnB will continue someday, because this kind of ending didn&#039;t really put a dot in the story, it rather expanded the universe much more than the canon series.<br />
<br />
 I will wait for new season of Kuroko no Basuke with new genious players and new encounter of Kuroko and Kagami. I will be waiting.

    Kuroko no Basket: Last Game will entertain fans of the series and sports genre, but is slightly disappointing as a conclusion to the story given the quality of the original series.<br />
<br />
Story 6/10: <br />
<br />
The story is very basic, a team of asshole players from America come and act disrespectfully to Japanese basketball. In response the Generation of Miracles and Kagami form a dream team to prove their strength to the arrogant villains and play one final game together.<br />
<br />
The original series featured additional meaning in it&#039;s games such as the importance of winning if you aren&#039;t having fun, overcoming injury and the consequences of losing passion for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review273446">
        your hobby. I&#039;m not saying Kuroko no Basket was a deconstruction of the sports genre, but the additional depth was appreciated. This game basically serves as high quality fanservice, which is fine and entertaining to watch but could have been allot more.<br />
<br />
Art 6/10:<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the art quality was disappointing in Last Game. Usually studios will step up the art quality for anime movies, but the opposite seems to have occurred here. The art doesn&#039;t look bad, it just looks worse than the original series in my opinion. The character designs have also slightly changed and don&#039;t look quite as good. This may just be me being used to the old designs, but it was an odd choice.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10:<br />
<br />
Thankfully the sound work is stellar and really helps set the mood. The songs all do a good job of building hype when needed, aswell as a few returning from the series. All the original cast have returned and do a great job.<br />
<br />
Characters 5/10:<br />
<br />
Probably the weakest point of this movie, the new villains are really underwhelming and forgettable. Good sports anime tend to humanise the opponents and explain their backstories to show how their personalities have been shaped. Unfortunately you won&#039;t see any of that in Kuroko no Basket Last Game. All we know about these villains are:<br />
<br />
a) They are good at basketball<br />
b) They are racists<br />
<br />
I appreciate you are working with a very limited run time with a movie but an effort to develop the opponents helps increase the games excitement.<br />
<br />
The generation of miracles redeem this section by receiving some closure to their stories, mainly Akashi and Murasakibara, who&#039;s stories felt slightly incomplete in the series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 8/10:<br />
<br />
Despite it&#039;s flaws Last Game is able to remain consistently entertaining. The over the top shonen powers from the series are all here in full swing, and while fans of unrealistic sports anime&#039;s will be disappointed, you should have known what you were getting into by now.<br />
<br />
Overall 7/10:<br />
<br />
If you enjoyed Kuroko no Basket you&#039;ll definitely enjoy this movie. The quality isn&#039;t quite at the level of the fantastic series, but the basketball match was still an entertaining watch despite the lackluster opponents.

    Kuroko no Basket Movie 4 : Last Game<br />
<br />
When you thought that the story ends after tge Winter Cup Tournament, this movie turns out to be the final phase of the story. Well, basketball does not end in one&#039;s country. After winning the game, there is no doubt that another player, much more talented, much more better, will go your way. During the movie, American Basketball Team, famous in the field of Basketball visited Japan. A point where all of the members of the Generations of Miracles, along with Kuroko and Kagami, will have to fight them comes. It is very interesting and exciting movie since

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306631">
        it will be the first time showing how they play as a real team. How they realize that there are players who can match up on their level, who can take them head on, that will trigger them to do more than what they are doing. And to depend on their teammates because basketball is a five player game and not one. Well, Kuroko did made them realize that fact. What I find kind of disturbing is the animation of this movie which is really different from the series. I love it if this was made similar to the animation of the series. <br />

Kuroko No Basket Anime Review<br />
By: Tadatoshi Fujimaki<br />
April 15, 2019<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Plot: 10<br />
<br />
Sports Anime genre have only one path to take, tournaments. Participating individually or by teaming up, it is the most common plot that exist. While this is not a unique one, it will be the author&#039;s capability how he manage to capture the interest of the viewer and excite them. This series focuses on students who love playing basketball. At first, I am really not interested on watching this anime. It is kind of absurd to think of a basketball story with extraordinary skills. But after trying it out, it made me realize that the plot of the story is great. I love the simplicity of it. The main reason of why the series moves forward and how it affects every branches of the story. Unrealistic as it may seem, the lesson is still there. The creator successfully stress out the core value when playing basketball. What also made me hook on this series is the directness of every plays all of the basketball teams have. Each play only last for an average of 5 to 6 episodes. Flashbacks are there but its only on a really minimum basis. You can enjoy watching all of the plays without so much cliffhanging and annoying side stories of the characters. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
It is already a known that almost all of the characters on this series are super cool. It is the reason why most of the girl watched it, I think. Aside from that fact, the development of the characters can totally be seen along the story. The changes and realization they made make them more of a human. Though not skillfully speaking. Since there are so many characters, giving all of them the spotlight is hard. And that&#039;s whats amazing. The creator successfully introduce a past where most of the characters belong. That way, it won&#039;t be hard tackling each of the characters past and it gives the story more time in other scenarios that needs to be displayed. I love how the story never depend on the back story of the characters so much that it will take too much time to explain it. <br />
<br />
Sound and Animation: 10<br />
<br />
Perfect. My phone is full of Kises&#039; picture. Yes, every character is so handsome but it is not only this. The animation of the story is really great. Parts where the characters show dribbling, passing, shooting or even guarding their opponents is really detailed. I love how they show the movements of the characters playing on the court, as well as their expression depending on the feeling they have. Should I also mention the voices? Yes, theirs are really cool and perfectly matches the looks of the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
I am not really a fan of basketball. I do not hate it, but I do not also like it. This is the first anime basketball which got me hooked. Due to so much enjoyment watching it, I&#039;ve finished it in a more faster time than the other series I tried. Every episode will make you want more, more plays, more actions on the court, more characters to encounter with. It is really exciting, and fun to watch. <br />
<br />
Ending: 10<br />
<br />
This is the best route to take for an ending on this series. The main goal of Kuroko has been met after winning the nationals with his team. But no, the story did not really move forward just because they had to win. It is because he had to bring back his loss previously. He had to bring back all of the people precious to him and he did. Fixing things that is broken and making them realize the most important thing when doing the thing they love. I am content with the ending of this series. It is simple, yet it will made you realize something important.

    NOTE: Please read with caution for this review consists of several spoilers from the movie that might affect your experience with it.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest challenges that writers deal with when coming up with a continuation of an already concluded story is the seamless transition between old to new content. If your characters have already had their resolution, what else to write about? But in Kurko no Basket&#039;s stead, the cannon TV series&#039; finale already felt like an interrupted sports program, and if that did not help, Sports, in general, are about the challenge rather than the destination, so inherently, the genre of this story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review360440">
        gives free passes for limitless spin-offs or even plot expansion on demand.<br />
<br />
Story (8/10):<br />
Right after the end game of the third season, a new challenge has the Generation of Miracles bond together in order to face, a foe so formidable that the all of them were required to form a one-off team of dreams to save face and pressure a group of the world-renowned street basketball team to eat their words after humiliating and talking badly about basketball in Japan. There is really no story to recognize other than a standalone intense game of Basketball, the motive behind this felt kind of forced as though the writers were looking for the slightest excuse to force this game to make happen, but the pay-off is making for all of that.<br />
The game did not feel dragged or longer than it should, very intense and never boring with minimal dialogue and actual play. Every player on cour got to shine and show off their skills.<br />
Fast forward to the end of the movie, it becomes straight up apparent that this is less of a spin-off screening and more of a real conclusion to the story as it devolves into what happens to Kagami and Kuroko and how they are planning their separate futures.<br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
As if the original TV show wasn&#039;t much of eye candy already, the art style in this one is so true and more faithful to that of the Manga.<br />
The animation doesn&#039;t fall short on delivering also, you know the key Zone moment has to have the most fluid and organic flow from frame to frame so that it looks seamless and sells the movement and speed in a more believable manner.<br />
The use of CGI is even better and less noticeable in this movie, as they say, good 3D is the one that blends well with 2D that it&#039;s almost as if it&#039;s nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Sound (7.5/10):<br />
I think the play of the basketball is way too powerful of a visual immerse that everything else pales in compassion. My memory is kinda hazy but a beat was present there, perhaps remixes of the OSTs from the parent show as well. The voice acting was as generic as any other episode from the TV show.<br />
<br />
Characters (8/10):<br />
I mean, the TV show has already expanded so much on the main cast, that it leaves nothing else to discuss regarding them, but somehow, Akashi&#039;s resolution find its way into this movie, and thus his split-personality finally got a good wrap up arc that was very consistent with the mini-story that plays in-parallel to the game.<br />
The opposing team was nothing very special, the character design was cool, to say the least, however, personality-wise, they brought nothing new to the table and felt more like a placeholder for any strong team that could shake the Generation of Miracles.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9.2/10):<br />
What a great watch it was. Non stop blood thrilling moments one after the other, literally, a fan-service movie that fulfills all the fantasies you had about the main character and all the team-ups you&#039;ve ever wanted. What&#039;s even better is the rewatchability, it&#039;s insane, I was ready to jump straight back in after finishing the movie.<br />
<br />
Overall (8.34):<br />
This is the types of movies that you can safely watch or show to a friend that hasn&#039;t seen any of the parent show and still get an immense sense of enjoyment out of. It&#039;s very easy to follow, doesn&#039;t really have that spoilers either, nothing too important, and really makes you in the spirit of re-watching the series again and again.

    Last Game, the closest thing to this series to having an international cup. I finally got around to watching it so, how is it? (SPOILER ALERT)<br />
<br />
The movie starts with flashback that fleshes out kagami&#039;s backstory (which mostly plays to what happens at the end of the movie) before we plunges into this new group, Jabberwock, crushing a team made out of some graduating members that seirin fought before. And of course, being the super villain they are, the leader went on with making a statement on how every basketball player in japan are just a bunch of &quot;monkeys&quot; trying to play one (They say after

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332879">
        beating exactly one team in the country.) Before Kagetora challenges them for a revenge match for that. And in order to counter this new rising baddies, comes the Generations of Miracle + Kagami dream team to fight it. The story itself ain&#039;t that complicated, setting up the scene for only a bit before we plunges into 1 hours+ of the basketball match.<br />
<br />
Now, the characters. It&#039;s nice to get some interaction with the GOM that doesn&#039;t involves them being a cocky bloodthristy psycho. There&#039;s also a lot of finally seeing how they acts after they had their superiority complex knocked out of them, and how the relationship between members develops for the better and in a friendly terms like their middle school days which is nice. The one benefitted from the most development however, is akashi. Who finally comes to terms with his dual personality and came to a good middle ground of what he should be as a player. Then there&#039;s the jabberwock. We only had 2 named character on that team, One is &quot;Nash Gold Jr&quot; an arrogant prick, and the other is &quot;Jason Silver&quot; an even more arrogant prick #2. Outside of being super strong player, it&#039;s too bad we don&#039;t get to see more of their personality other than some hints on nash being possibly a basketballer with the style of official match one and &quot;struggles&quot; hard to reach his position.<br />
<br />
Overall, how is it? It&#039;s more KNB with all their flashes and auras with the budget of a movie and pretty cool cameras movement, have much engrish in it,  and granrodeo return for it&#039;s ost. It&#039;s the final confetti being popped for the show (if there&#039;s no sequel), if you liked the show already, you should definitely give this a watch.
