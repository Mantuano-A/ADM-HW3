    -This review has been updated after all the episodes were aired, and was first written while the show was airing.  It is meant to help the reader determine if it is worthwhile watching an episode or two to form their own opinions.-<br />
<br />
Seitokai Yakuindomo is a school comedy with little or no relevant story that focuses largely on verbal adult humor, generally avoiding visual adult humour. As with most shows of this genre, it isn’t mind-blowing or beautiful – throughout the show I found myself noticing little aspects that the show could have done without. <br />
<br />
However, at the end of the each episode, I looked

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28272">
        back and realized that I had laughed throughout. I had realized that the show may not be spectacular, but it was funny. The randomness and quick pacing of the humor is vital to the show&#039;s appeal, and the show begins to settle into a quick, smooth pace after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
What is important to note is that this humor will not be for everyone, and after two episodes the viewer should be able to decide whether or not they enjoy the type of humor enough to continue on with the show.<br />
<br />
Artwork &amp; Sound: Average; nothing worth highlighting, nothing negative. It is worth mentioning that the Ending song is very catchy, however.<br />
<br />
Characters: The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo are not terribly unique. Each character can be summed up as having some of the usual generic characteristics normally found in anime. However, the characters fit into their roles well, and it is because of this the humor succeeds.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The enjoyment of this show is what carries my generally favorable review of it (especially as the show progresses into its later episodes). At the end of the episode, you may not walk away amazed, but you will walk away with a few good laughs.

    Is it possible to make a comedy revolving almost exclusively around sex jokes, and not have it come off low-brow and immature? <br />
The answer? Seitokai Yakuindomo.<br />
<br />
Thanks to clever wordplay, good writing and actual punch lines, Seitokai Yakuindomo manages to craft a sex comedy that avoids the pitfall of simply being crass for the sake of crassness and is all the more funnier for it. No matter how many jokes about ejaculation they make. By taking their sex jokes down the path of wordplay and and humorous misunderstandings, (instead of making shallow references to dicks and expecting the audience fall over dead from laughter), Seitokai Yakuindomo

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93713">
        almost manages to give itself a sense of class. Almost. But more importantly, this makes the gags actually funny. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, those who hate sex jokes, or the easily offended, probably won&#039;t enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo. And yet somehow, the show manages to not be ridiculously offensive, despite containing gags that would make South Park blush. I think this is combination of the way the jokes are presented in an innocent, serious way (sort of like the characters are unaware what they&#039;re saying is inappropriate for the situation, if that makes sense) and the colourful cheery art style.<br />
<br />
This series makes no bones about what is is, that is, it&#039;s nothing more than a platform for a rapid-fire series of sex jokes, and at this, I feel it&#039;s a flying success. The show is absolutely hilarious, which is all it needs to be. As a result, there&#039;s very little I can criticize it for. It&#039;s only real flaw is the length, only thirteen episodes, which is average for most anime, but for Seitokai Yakuindomo, it feels like this isn&#039;t enough and it has more jokes to tell. <br />
<br />
If you’re looking for a decent plot or a nice story, go somewhere else. Seitokai Yakuindomo doesn&#039;t have either of it. Seitokai Yakuindomo is about an all-girls school turned co. The girls don’t really mind this though; it’s more like a dream come true for most of them. Through the whole series it’s one perverted joke after the other. Most of them you can see coming from a mile away, but they will make you laugh anyway.<br />
<br />
The animation often switches between normal animation and chibi mode. Usually I don’t like it when there’s too much chibi in an anime, but with Seitokai Yakuindomo I didn&#039;t really mind. Perhaps it’s because I put my mind on blank while watching this.<br />
<br />
Music fits the series perfectly, especially the dynamic, rhythmic and crazy, and a phenomenal opening and twisted ending. Because of the dialogue and humour it&#039;s difficult to pay attention to music in the background, but there are some good pieces. Very well emphasizes moral and peaceful moments in the series.<br />
<br />
I generally like the different characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I guess they’re actually not that different (they’re all perverted girls), but two of our main characters are normal people, trying to put some common sense in most of the school. The interaction between these is the main power of this anime. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, Seitokai Yakuindomo is an excellent comedy series, provided you don&#039;t find it&#039;s lewd subjects offensive, and you don&#039;t mind that there&#039;s very little story. Anyone who loves a well-written sex comedy should check it out.<br />
<br />
I probably only enjoyed this because of my young age and immaturity, that&#039;s right all you pedophiles. COME AT ME BRO.<br />
I mean I&#039;m a masochist. <br />
Wait what.

    Let me start off by saying that Seitokai Yakuindomo is probably right up there on the top 5 anime to have me in hysterics every 5 minutes or so, if you&#039;re looking for an anime full of laughs, simple characters and no emotional story so there&#039;s no drama, this is EXACTLY what you&#039;re looking for, if you&#039;re looking for romance, ecchi, love triangles, drama, sadness etc, you should probably give this a miss, although there are vague hints of love interest.<br />
<br />
The story revolves around Takotoshi Tsuda, A male high school student who decides to transfer to an all-girls school simply because its closer to home,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review111557">
        he ends up being forcibly recruited into the student body council as a male representative. He is joined by three girls;<br />
<br />
Shino Amakusa - a second-year student and student body president, she is very serious and wants things done perfectly, she excels in academics, but all that is shadowed by the fact that she is a complete pervert, and the main reason she took an interest to Takotoshi was to &#039;examine&#039; him in Health and Social class (Yep, you know exactly where i&#039;m going with this), she is very self conscious about her breast size, and the fact her secretary, Aria, is well endowed, is the recipe for a perfect jealousy driven relationship between the two.<br />
<br />
Aria Shichijo - Also a second year, she plays the role of the student body secretary, she comes from a very rich family and just by appearance you&#039;d expect her to be the most mature character...and if you make that assumption, you&#039;re horribly wrong.<br />
Aria is extremely perverted too, more than Shino is, she manages to twist and turn even the most innocent and simplest of sentences into a fanfiction-esque scene which appear in thought bubbles, because she is absurdly rich and well pampered, she often finds herself in completely ridiculous situations, such as standing blankly in front of a door expecting it to slide open, or standing on the bottom step of a staircase thinking its an elevator. She too is incredibly smart, and is ranked second, underneath Shino, of course, in her class midterms.<br />
<br />
Finally we have Suzu Hagimura, who is in the same year as our unfortunate protagonist, again, she is very smart and often brags about her ability to do 10 digit arithmetic calculations in her head to cover up the fact she&#039;s not really good at any physical activities, although she is 16 years old and considers her self to be superior to Takotoshi, she is often the butt of the joke when it comes to childlike appearance and height as she is less than half the size of the other three and in one episode, needs a chair to reach the top shelf of her own cabinet, this often causes her to go into a super-saiyan rage whenever her unnaturally small stature is brought into a conversation, and of course, Takotoshi is the straight man for them all.<br />
<br />
What i like about this show is that all the characters have their own traits , pros and cons which make them completely different from one another, although these characters aren&#039;t well flushed out with heaps of back story and social problems (they don&#039;t need to be for this genre of anime) the characters end up being likeable anyway, whether its for the witty banter between them in literally EVERY scene, or whether its the shear pervertedness of Shino and Aria (especially Aria, damn man) its definitely a must watch.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d recommend this anime to anyone, especially to fans of K-On! or Lucky Star (although the themes in this are significantly more mature than anything in K-On! and Lucky Star)<br />
<br />
Thankyou for reading, message me an anime you want me to review and have a good day!<br />
<br />

    Seitokai Yakuin domo: The Show Prison School and Shimoneta Wanted To Be! <br />
<br />
Preface:<br />
<br />
The Japanese school setting + student council + all girl&#039;s school with few male entrants + perverted characters + ecchi/fanservice/nudity/andor harem is a really tired, really overdone concept at this point. For example: there have been at least 20 such shows involving at least 2 of the aforementioned tropes just THIS year. Count &#039;em. <br />
<br />
The reason that there are currently so many of these shows is less that they&#039;re a real &quot;work&quot; and more of a &quot;product&quot; designed and marketed specifically to an audience that consistently and routinely purchases their product in large

          <span style="display: none;" id="review202270">
        quantities. It&#039;s like the cigarette of anime. They&#039;re not good for you, but a lot of people really love them, and keep on buying it even though they know it&#039;s killing them.<br />
<br />
However- even the most cynical reviewers among us eventually realize that even the most recycled concepts and tropes can still make for an effective and enjoyable show... IF executed properly. Though Seitokai Yakuin domo includes all of the above with the exception of the last trope I mentioned, the writers took the established tropes and turned them upside down, adding some freshness to a nauseatingly stale formula. It&#039;s all about turning that &quot;girls can&#039;t be pervs&quot; trope upside down, and in that regard- a great success!<br />
<br />
Even though it&#039;s a comedy- I only laughed out loud one time at Seitokai Yakuin domo. It&#039;s kind of like The Big Lebowski (or any Coen Brothers&#039; film for that matter) in that it&#039;s not actually funny at all. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s entertaining. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s a chuckle comedy- not an uproarious, couch clutching, gasping for breath humor riot. They do tend to wear out the jokes after a while, and if you never found them funny in the first place (like in Prison School), then you&#039;re in for a long watch. <br />
<br />
If incessant panty shots and boobs are your main attraction to these shows, SYD is NOT for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Animation/Sound/Voice Acting: 7<br />
<br />
Truth be told, I really only watched this show because it was animated by GoHands, and it looks like most anime made in this decade: shiny, colorful, and pretty fluid. One thing I noticed (and liked about this anime) was that nobody had ridiculous hairstyles NOR did they have unnatural hair colors. Everyone actually looked like a normal human being, which, for a school anime, is a HUGE step. +1 for progressiveness. <br />
<br />
The voices are handled competently, veteran Yoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory) was great as Shino, and Satomi Arai plays the deadpan creeper Hata (She also portrayed Saotome from the more recent Shimoneta, a very similar character hmmmmmmmmm)<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
<br />
SYD was adapted from a long running 4 panel comic that&#039;s essentially just a collection of making fun of trope scenes from other anime, along with their own flavor of sex jokes. That said, it&#039;s difficult to take 30 or 40 four panel one liner jokes and turn that into a single episode. GoHands somehow manages to make it flow into an easy to follow comedy show about life in the student council with this pretty radical choppy pace coupled with segments that take the original jokes and expound upon them. They added a lot more context and setup, and then let it play out. <br />
<br />
You&#039;re actually shown the punchline as a commercial slide, and then the scene plays out, giving you something to chew on and wonder where this weird, out of context line comes from. It definitely helps with the impact as well- kind of an &quot;OHHHH&quot; moment for the longer jokes.<br />
<br />
The general premise of SYD is that Tsuda, our MC, is a newly accepted student to the formerly all girls Ousai Academy. On his first day, he makes the mistake of not tightening his tie, which attracts the ire of the Student Council President, Shino- who teaches him a lesson by fixing his tie, strangling him, and then forcibly inducts him into the Student Council. The rest of the show takes place over the school year, with the various holidays, sex jokes, outings, gross out jokes, and mischief that come along with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 7<br />
<br />
There are four student council members, President Shino, VP Tsuda, Secretary Aria, and Treasurer Suzu. There&#039;re also four other characters of note: the creepy lady teacher Yokoshima, who is basically a pedophile and tries incessantly to get with the few guys attending the school, Hata, the monotone speaking newspaper club member who always shows up to take scandalous and incriminating photos of everyone, Mitsuba, the adorably innocent (of the horrible sexual things Aria and Shino say) Judo girl, and Kaede, who is man-phobic. <br />
<br />
Each character has an in show 4th wall breaking description: Shino, &quot;the perfect human&quot; (who is an incorrigible pervert), Aria, &quot;the multitalented princess with big boobs&quot; (rich girl airhead everyone fawns over, also a pervert), and Suzu &quot;IQ of 180&quot; (height of 4&#039;5&quot;, terrible napoleon complex and hates being treated like a child). Tsuda, our MC, is basically the world&#039;s most legendary straight man. He serves for there to be a brick wall to hit for the endless stream of sex and poop jokes coming from Shino/Aria. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 6<br />
<br />
The actual content of the jokes is what I referred to as refreshing in the beginning. I have not seen an anime with such disgusting, foul content toilet jokes since Panty and Stocking. It goes so overboard with perversion of speech and dirty jokes + toilet humor that it&#039;s not even scandalous anymore, it&#039;s commonplace. You know, without a doubt, that everything that comes out of Shino&#039;s or Aria&#039;s mouths is going to be a) a bad sex joke, b) a women&#039;s hygiene gross out joke, or c) some &quot;accidental&quot; misreading/pronunciation of a normal kanji that then turns the meaning into something sexual. <br />
<br />
While these are fairly common in comedy anime, again, the degree to which they describe some of this stuff is pretty nasty, so +1 for edgy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 7<br />
<br />
Well, this ran a lot longer than I wanted it to- but it&#039;s important to see more formative shows in genre tropes- and one can see the obvious influences this show (and the comics before it) had on such newer titles as Prison School and Shimoneta. <br />
<br />
Aria: &quot;Wow, a whole year has passed. It only felt like a few months.&quot;<br />
Shino: &quot;In an anime, that&#039;d be about 13 episodes!&quot;<br />
Tsuda: &quot;That&#039;s a little too dangerous...&quot;

    I have seen over 300 different Anime over the years, including notably terrible Anime, like Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, Mars of Destruction, Xenosaga: The Animation, Mahou Sensei Negima and InuYasha, and I can safely say that Seitokai Yakuindomo is the absolute worst Anime I have ever seen. <br />
<br />
I rarely drop Anime, even the worst ones. I usually complete an Anime no matter how bad it is, just so I can tell people &quot;Don&#039;t watch this Anime, it&#039;s terrible&quot; with a completely unbiased opinion. However, Seitokai Yakuindomo is SO BAD that I couldn&#039;t hold out for any longer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29910">
        than episode 4.<br />
<br />
Seitokai Yakuindomo is the worst kind of Anime, pandering to the worst kind of Anime &quot;fan,&quot; a shallow &quot;comedy&quot; (I use quotations because it&#039;s not funny) that focuses on fanservice and repetitive sex-related &quot;jokes&quot; that only the most immature, sexually depraved teenagers could possibly enjoy. <br />
<br />
There is no comedy to be found here. Every single &quot;joke&quot; is pulled from the same gutter, oftentimes using the exact same &quot;joke&quot; multiple times in an episode. Then again, you can barely call them jokes. Here, let me rewrite this paragraph again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo&#039;s &quot;jokes&quot;, to give you an idea of what to expect.<br />
<br />
There is no S&amp;M to be found here. Every single penis is pulled from the same condom, oftentimes using the exact same penis multiple times in a vagina. Then again, you can barely call them dicks. Here, let me molest this virgin again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo&#039;s period, to give you an idea of what to fuck.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#039;t funny, was it? Why, that was offensive, wasn&#039;t it? It sounded like shameless pandering to perverted, immature teenagers, didn&#039;t it? Well, guess what? That is exactly what Seitokai Yakuindomo&#039;s dialog is like. This is Seitokai Yakuindomo&#039;s idea of a &quot;joke&quot;, which it will use in every single scene despite the fact that it wasn&#039;t funny the first time, much less the dozens of other times. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo, it&#039;s just plain bad. There&#039;s no way to argue it, you cannot possibly gain any sort of enjoyment from watching it.<br />
<br />
At least the opening and ending themes are pretty good.

    Before you go all harem on this show, just think back to your blooming adolescent and teenage years. For boys and girls alike, wasn&#039;t your mind constantly filled with inappropriate thoughts? There wasn&#039;t much of a trigger to set you off; testosterone and estrogen are powerful little demons. So instead of marketing those stupidly impossible innocent anime girls other series seem so fond of, why not appeal potty humor to a wider audience that each individual has, at one point, experienced? I may not know much about how the opposite gender thinks, but for us guys, certain thoughts flit about our heads like angry bees,

        never leaving us alone. This may all seem off-topic, Seitokai Yakuindomo delivers the highest of quality of sexual jokes, all while incorporating a storyline and masterfully pulling off a non-harem, hilarious and wonderfully executed anime. <br />
<br />
 Story: 8/10<br />
<br />
The story is simple: an all girl high school recently became co-ed. STOP. Before you go further, isn&#039;t your first automatic judgement to insult another hentai-style slice of life anime? Of course! Any sane person would. A friendly, non-perverted guy by the name of Tsuda enters the school, unwittingly tripping off Shina Amakasu and the rest of the all-girl student. After some misunderstandings, randomness and hilarity, he is forced into the student council - with gratifying results. <br />
<br />
Now don&#039;t get me wrong, haters may understand that these sort of anime don&#039;t have a storyline. Most of the time, they&#039;re right. Here, it does apply somewhat; a frilly way to tell a story, so to speak. However, I had a wonderful time watching the student council do their every day activities - with a twist. These aren&#039;t your normal, typical, average, innocent virgin high school girls; these are some of the craziest anime girls I&#039;ve ever come across. There seems to be no end to the jokes and innuendoes; and interestingly enough, TSUDA (THE GUY, FOR FREAKING SAKE) is the innocent one. What in all that is mighty in the anime world has this come to? A guy? As the sole non-perverted rock amid this flood of girls? This anime was so different, I was instantly hooked - and so should you be.<br />
<br />
Art: 9/10.<br />
<br />
The animation was gorgeous and bright. I typically don&#039;t like overdone scenes or underdone scenes, and this didn&#039;t disappoint me in the lease. There were times when they decided to go for the chibi look randomly and drew the characters innocently - an interesting juxtaposition, because while in chibi mode the characters decided to say funny little innuendos.... Ah well. Enough gushing. What I didn&#039;t like? Sometimes the artwork borderlined porn. No way out of that... I mean, it looked fine and all, but trying watching those scenes while there are young people around you! Geez, put some CLOTHES ON. But seriously, even then the artwork never dipped below par.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
<br />
The OP and ED. Wow. What an upbeat, fantastical way of starting an anime. The OP was perfect and catchy, on my ipod in seconds, and the ED was.....weird. Sorta serious, sorta not. The background music melded perfectly with the on-screen mood, but in and of itself I was not impressed as much. Though I know I repeat this in my other reviews, but seriously, pay attention to the voice acting. Try acting out those scenes by yourself. It&#039;s not easy; but when you can make perverted jokes into a mic without eliciting even a laugh, that takes some guts. The voices were spot on, serious and joking, warm and memorable. <br />
<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
Lovely, lovely cast. Perfect for the story, each character represented a typical sort of archetype. Tsuda, the innocent one; Hagimiru, the tsundere, the list goes on and on. Each character had their moments and contributed a little more to the story; even Tsuda&#039;s little ball of comedy managed to get a good laugh out of me. But seriously, I loved each and every character, because they simply melded so perfectly. It&#039;s so hard to imagine a different cast or to introduce another main character, because the magic happened with this perfect combination. It wasn&#039;t perfect; there were some stupid parts (even the best cake may be too sweet for some people), but overall, it was beautiful to see the interactions take place. Though there wasn&#039;t much of a character arc at all for anyone, I enjoyed their daily banter nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />

Why is the average score so low? Many people looked past what this anime was really trying to go for (toilet humor) and just hit it with a low score and moved on. It&#039;s a self-fulfilling prophecy; if you watch the first episode and grudgingly try and finish it, you&#039;re experience won&#039;t be nearly as pleasant than if you were to go into watching each episode with enthusiasm and a piece of pie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short but sweet little 13 episode anime. Don&#039;t look at the superficial, shallow characteristics; dig a little deeper, and what you&#039;ll find may actually not be a condom but a vibrating Christmas present...

    First thing first &quot;Its not like Kaichou wa Maid sama or Setokai no Ichizon at all&quot;...well the basic plot is somewhat similar with Setokai no Ichi...but the jokes and characters are different..In SNI the male character was not so serious type of guy where as this guy is the only in Setokai of this series with some sense and is the center of all kind of B grade jojes.<br />
Since this series is new so I cant write more than what I ve seen so far..<br />
<br />
Story : Well the description has been typed so nothing new.<br />
<br />
Humor : Lots of adult jokes in first ten minutes of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27946">
        first episode<br />
<br />
Characters : Typical Harem like characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment : This is the second series in a row after B Gata H Kei which consist lots of adult jokes so if you liked B Gata than you will like it too<br />
<br />
Note : I ll edit my review after watching some more episodes.

    &quot;Dick-jokes the anime&quot;, these were the words that got me interested in this show, and it I couldn&#039;t describe it any better. It starts off seeming like a typical romcam/harem, but Seitokai Yakuindomo has its own unique genre of humor that sets it apart from the norm. <br />
<br />
As a show with constant references to dildos, cum, sex, incest, boobs, panties, dicks and literally everything dirty you can honestly think of, in a show about high school girls, you would think this would be ecchi, but it&#039;s not. It&#039;s a slice of life anime with some of the most creative and unique comedy I have ever

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170039">
        seen. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around the typical harem lead male surrounded by beautiful girls (The school is 95% women), but the great thing about it is that each girl represents a porn category/fetish. Notable one&#039;s include incest, extreme fetishes, innocent/amateur, voyeur, midget, and milf, but the list goes on. They all have amazing personalities that compliment their &quot;role&quot; in the show&#039;s twisted sense of humor. <br />
<br />
The writing is excellent, I find myself occasionally bored but more often than not I was laughing my ass off. The jokes are generally creative, and some scenes are almost impossible not to laugh. If you find immature humor funny, such as the type of stuff you might see in Gintama, this is a show made for you.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, arguably this shows weakest point is its lack of story. It heavily reminds me of something like Kiss x Sis in that regard, it has some minor plot regarding entrance exams but for the most part every episode feels like an OVA, and the episodes themselves are so fragmented that it can sometimes be hard to follow. <br />
<br />
In addition, as mentioned already there times where the humor does get a little stale, since it is basically sex jokes as far as the eye can see. Sometimes the humor feels forced and the jokes are word for word repeats of previous episodes. These are few and far between but keep this in mind.<br />
<br />
Anyway, by now you should know whether or not you&#039;ll like it. Perverted humor is not for everyone, but if you enjoy it, this show has made a science out of it.

    I rarely write reviews after i see the first episode...but for this poorly made anime I&#039;ll make an exception.<br />
<br />
This showfelt like it was a little of kaichou wa miad-sama and seitokai no ichizon put together. but this is NOT the reason why I give this a two people. lol this is just a general feeling!<br />
<br />
For story...well....there is none, dont get your hopes up.<br />
<br />
Art...(i dont rate for art cuz it doesnt matter to me)<br />
<br />
sound: maa maa, dont know what else to say.<br />
<br />
character 0.1 lol and thats being generous lol The main character has no emotion, hes like a leaf in the wind. Just floating not doing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review27938">
        anything. The girls in the student council are vulgar and just retarded. ( The girls try to make funny jokes but they never are funny. the jokes are just vulgar and...wrong..., and they just make you think like the main character &quot;TMI, TMI&quot;. This is why I rated this anime a two because the humor really offended me. <br />
<br />
enjoyment 0.0000001 that too is generous XD let me take note that I am not a fan of deep ecchi animes like this one. I&#039;m more of a action anime person. as you can see by m anime list. I watched this on a whim while I was waiting for other animes to download. Its just not my type of anime.<br />
<br />
overall a two because the sound was fine lol <br />
<br />
I plead with you to drop this and or not watch it and watch something better like seitokai no ichizon, my bride is a mermaid or sayonara zetsubou sensei. they are the best humor animes out right now and they actually make funny jokes and will have you laughing till it hurts.

    What comes to mind when you think about high school girls? No, I’m not talking about perverted stuff, but rather how they act. Most of us think that high school girls are shy, oversensitive and keep to themselves and that’s pretty much how they’re depicted in a lot of media these days, especially in anime. Seitokai Yakuindomo shows us a different side of modern teenagers and brings lots of humour and parody with it.<br />
<br />
Basically, Seitokai Yakuindomo is about a teenager named Tsuda Takatoshi who decides to attend Ousai Academy due to the fact that it’s close to his home, even though this particular high school

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31671">
        used to be a former all-girls’ academy up until recently. During his very first day at school, Tsuda meets a couple of girls who turn out to be members of the student council. Some of them are actually quite perverted and often spurt out the dirtiest jokes, but what’s worse is that they recruit Tsuda into the student council and even go as far as to make him vice-president. This all happens in a matter of minutes and our unfortunate hero has little say in any of it.<br />
<br />
During the thirteen episodes of Seitokai Yakuindomo you’ll be constantly bombarded with dirty sex jokes, perverted talk and unwanted information about the female body and their period cycle. There are little to no serious scenes in the entire anime and most of it comprises of convenient situations to score another sex joke or a dirty conversation, with Tsuda often used as a serious retort or an enraged response.<br />
<br />
There aren’t too many characters in the anime, though most of them are put to good use and no of them feel forced or useless. You’ve got the protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi who just wants to lead a normal life and high school but is constantly attacked by his fellow female students with dirty jokes and unwarranted accusations. Then there are the three other members of the student council, all female, obviously. Shino Amakusa is the president of the council and maybe the most perverted of all characters, always available when you need a quick dirty joke. Aria Shichijou is the mature rich girl, though her mind is just about as perverted as that of Shino’s. Last but not least, yet definitely the shortest, is Suzu Hagimura, the intelligent and silent girl. She is about the same age as Tsuda, but has the body of an elementary school student. You won’t get any dirty comments from her, but her short height will often be used as comic relief and target of several jokes.<br />
<br />
Seitokai certainly works well as a comedy and its non-stop approach at humour and constant verbal gags keeps every episode fun and entertaining. What the anime lacks in proficiency it makes up for with its engaging plot and easy-going nature. It’s definitely not a great series and apart from an episode that takes place on the beach or another one where our heroes celebrate Christmas, Seitokai Yakuindomo lacks diversity. Most of the anime takes place at the academy, namely inside a couple of rooms and on a corridor. Whenever our characters are taken in a different location, it’s often only so as to set up a joke or make a funny remark at something in that particular environment. Another weak point is that every episode seems to be cut down in short scenes, each about one minute, that feature some random dialogue between a couple of our characters followed by one or two dirty jokes. Every scene starts with a build-up to the future joke or gag and usually ends directly after its purpose has been complete and the laughs and giggles have taken place.<br />
<br />
It’s rather hard to predict if you’ll like Seitokai Yakuindomo or not. Some will be drawn to it by its simple premise and fast pacing while others are going to be turned off by the overwhelming amount of sex jokes and weird character interactions. I really didn’t know what to make this series during the first few episodes and I simply couldn’t connect with certain scenes, which in the ended left an awkward impression on me. I got used to it eventually and after a while each episode turned out to be even funnier than the last one. It’s not an anime that I’ll remember for too long, though. It all comes down to what you’re looking for: there are enough laughs to be had in Seitokai Yakuindomo and it’s rarely boring or changing pace, so you can hardly go wrong with it. If you’re looking for a little more substance, on the other hand, then I advise you to keep on searching.

      This anime seems to defy normal logic. When told &quot;this anime&#039;s best points are SEX JOKES!&quot; I am sure most people would lose interest. Yet, this anime somehow is able to put itself out there with other great plot filled tear jerking anime simply through the uniqueness it holds. The jokes are played well, the characters contribute well to the flow, and it seems to carry a universal appeal. Even if you don&#039;t understand the jokes, the art and music alone would be a good enough a reason to at least give it a try. Highly recommend to just about anyone!

    It&#039;s my second review, so don&#039;t be very harsh with me. <br />
I think you&#039;ll like it!<br />
<br />
ART: 10<br />
<br />
The art in this Anime is, of course, great. And in the biggest part that&#039;s because this is an Anime of 2010. You&#039;ll enjoy watching the art which is present in this Anime, because it&#039;s a very good one. All emotions and feelings are expressed very well on the characters&#039; faces.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9<br />
<br />
This Anime has a very original story and characters. There are no other Anime titles which have such plot. A guy, who recently changed his place of living, tranfers to a school which just changed from a girls&#039;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30877">
        one to a co-ed and now it&#039;s still full of girls. Don&#039;t think bad about him! He&#039;s not a pervert. The reason he did this, is because that school is near the house he lives in. In the moment he entered the school, he is noticed by the Student&#039;s Council President and is enrolled immediatly in Council. The reason of this action was the thing that &quot;school needed a male&#039;s point of view&quot; and she wanted opinions from a male&#039;s perspective. And after this, he gets through a lot of events with girls. Oh, I forgot to mention, Student&#039;s Council consists of 3 girls. The two of them are so perverted! I couldn&#039;t believe my eyes! I have never seen such perverted girls in my life! You&#039;ll laugh a lot! It&#039;s so funny!<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: 10<br />
<br />
As I said, the main characters are 3 girls from Student&#039;s Council and Tsuda that transfered there. Aria and Shino from Council are the most perverted girls you had ever saw. Suzu is a very wise one, but is considered to be a child because of her height and some of her habits. The main protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi, is a normal boy like all of us, but not as perverted as some of us. I liked a lot how the President, Shino, behaves. She&#039;s so funny with all her erotic thoughts. If you like to watch comedy and funny Anime titles, then it&#039;s for you.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 9<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t tell very much about this part of Anime, because you&#039;ll not have time to notice such things, &#039;cause you&#039;ll laugh a lot at some scenes.<br />
The OP &amp; ED are good and they were chose very good to this Anime. Sound great characterizes  events that happen and emotions/ feelings that characters experience at that moments. Sound environment doesn&#039;t bother you, but suits very good this Anime!!!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT/OVERAGE: 10<br />
<br />
This is a very funny Anime you must watch if you would like to see what happens in a girls&#039; only school with a perverted Student&#039;s Council President. You will laugh at her rules and actions. Also, in Anime are used uncensored words (like masturbation, anal/oral sex, vagina, etc.) that are censored due to the fact that it&#039;s a PG-13 rated Anime. I recommend you to watch Ayako release (the same I watched), because of some reasons: <br />
1) Words that are audio-censored in Anime, are translated in subs, so you&#039;ll read the real things that are said. I mean, subs translate to you those things and you&#039;ll laugh more than if you&#039;ll watch a Raw (I mean, those who can).<br />
2) This is a very good subgroup and you&#039;ll agree more with this after you&#039;ll watch this Anime.<br />
This subgroup translated all words with double-meaning (that are often used), where one meaning is perverted/erotic for sure. The fact is that the President, Shino, very often thinks about that one. Also, were translated all Japanese words that are related to Japanese culture/history and are known/used only in Japan. (For example, Nyotaimori is the practice using women&#039;s bodies as a serving dish, usually for sushi.) (would you like to try something like that with your loved one?  addressed to male part who reads this review).<br />
<br />
In conclusion, watch this Anime ([Ayako] 720p release) for a good mood and AMAZING Impressions!!!!!

    I told myself I&#039;d write a review for Seitokai Yakuindomo immediately after finishing it, but eh, a couple weeks later is okay, right?<br />
<br />
Story: 6<br />
Seitokai Yakuindomo&#039;s story is very cliché. A boy starts attending a school that used to be girls-only, he joins the student council, which has only female members--we&#039;ve all heard it before etc, etc. If you&#039;re looking for epic plot and character development, look elsewhere, Seitokai Yakuindomo is good for laughs, not becoming a better human being, going on an adventure through anime, or other things like that; It&#039;s not even good for fapping. The reason I personally enjoyed Seitokai Yakuindomo was precisely

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31395">
        that. Seitokai Yakuindomo is perverted by all means, but it&#039;s in a different way than the majority of ecchi shows...It&#039;s actually funny. Throughout this 13-episode Seitokai no Ichizon lookalike, you&#039;ll actually laugh. The comedy ranges from simple comedic timing, to completely perverted jokes, to out-of-place &#039;wtf why is there a teddy bear with a ballgag?&#039;. This show is a very fun watch, but I will tell you to steer clear of it if either of the following apply to you: 1) You&#039;re looking for something serious 2) You dislike anything remotely related to ecchi.<br />
<br />
Art: 7<br />
SYD&#039;s art is nothing amazing, but it&#039;s definitely nothing bad either. The animation is nice and flows smoothly and the characters are cute. Of course there is some censoring of certain.. objects.. but that doesn&#039;t take away from the show because you&#039;ll definitely know what they are. And it&#039;s not like there is any explicit ecchi content (as in naked people) to censor.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
In terms of Seiyuu, SYD has decently popular voice actors. Shino and Aria are voiced by Hikasa Youko and Satou Satoumi (the voices of Mio and Ritsu of K-On!), respectively. And, my personal favorite, Arai Satomi (Kuroko from To Aru Majutsu no Index/To Aru Kagaku no Railgun) lends her voice to the expressionless newspaper club member, Hata Ranko. There are no complaints to be made about the voice acting in SYD, and hey, I like the opening as well. Osai Girls and Boys~!<br />
<br />
Character: 8<br />
The characters really make the show for me here. Well maybe not the characters, but the things that they say. Shino: tall blunt school prez, Aria: tall, busty Shirley-lookalike Ojou-sama, Suzu: genius loli Nagi-lookalike with a Napoleon complex, Tsuda: generic too nice anime lead. I just gave you a good idea of the characters you will encounter when watching Seitokai Yakuindomo, I&#039;m sure they sound pretty much as generic as possible, but if you watch the show, I think you&#039;ll find that with good, entertaining writing, even the most generic characters can become hilarious. <br />
Also, an honourable mention to Yokoshima-sensei, she&#039;s awesome.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
This is what made me continue to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo throughout summer 2010 season. The writing on this show is hilarious. I liked this show because I never knew what the characters were going to say next, but I knew whatever it was, it&#039;d be funny. I laughed through every episode and you will too, as long as you don&#039;t fall into one of the &#039;do not watch&#039; categories I mentioned earlier.<br />
<br />
I recommend this show to anyone who wants something that will make them laugh, doesn&#039;t mind pervertedness, and has free time on their hands. This show isn&#039;t a total /must see/, but if you enjoyed what I said about it in my review, I recommend checking it out :)<br />

    There seems to have been a lot of recent anime adapted from 4-koma mangas recently, Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD for short) is one them.<br />
<br />
====================*WARNING*======================<br />
 If you are the type of person who are not into constant sex related jokes and innuendos, then you can stop reading now, this anime is definitely is not for you.<br />
====================*WARNING*======================<br />
<br />
With that said, let&#039;s move on.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The main character, Takatoshi Tsuda, is forced into joining the student council of Ousai High School, which was formerly an all-girls school, by the president Akamusa Shino, in order to have a male&#039;s perspective into issues surrounding the new now co-ed school.<br />
This being a 4-koma comedy, there

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30827">
        is pretty much nothing that you can call an overall plot whatsoever as the anime is based on the 4 student council members and the time they spend there.<br />
As mentioned above, at least 90% of the comedy in the series are all adult, sex-related jokes. It will be hard going into an episode and not hear the characters use words like cum, penis, vagina, dildo, masturbation, etc...you get the idea. The series tries to deliver the jokes in new and clever ways each time, but even then some people might find the show start to get repetitive and old pretty fast. That was not the case for me luckily.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
While the art is not outstanding, the series shines with a bright and vibrant colour scheme. The chibi-deformed versions of the characters look adorable, and overall the animation is easy on the eyes.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
In terms of sound, the VAs do a respectable job in their roles, and with many well known voices in this series it all comes together nicely. In terms of BGM, its what you would expect from your standard comedy, high school anime, nothing really worth mentioning. The OP and ED themes however are surprisingly catchy and im still looping them even as I write this.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
As far as character goes, I think it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of SYD. While none of the characters are really unique and they all follow common stereotypes (Tsuda being the tsukomi, Aria is the rich girl who is ignorant about common things, Hagimura is the loli with a complex over it, and Shino is just Shino), they manage to blend together nicely and produce plenty of humorous events throughout the series, mainly because 90% of the cast are pretty much perverts. The side characters as well give the series an extra boost in comedy and many of them are likable. While romance is not the main focus of the series, by the later half of the series we are shown a bit of possible future relationship between Tsuda and some of the girls, in a show were everything is adult related comedy, its a rather nice addition and it doesnt derail the series&#039; direction. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I will be the first to admit that I wasnt into the show for the first 3 or so episodes, I usually dont enjoy the animes that are mostly about perverted talk/actions (latest example: B Gata H Kei) but this show slowly won me over and ended up becoming the show I was anticipating the most this season for reasons I still havent figured out myself fully (maybe the characters). I can say for sure that this series does get better as it goes along, and it does not lose momentum from there (except maybe the last episode). <br />
<br />
Overall if you are looking for a series with a potty mouth, then you must not look any further than this. If you can giggle at jokes involving dildos, penis, erection, vagina, masturbation, etc...you will also find the comedy in this series to be pretty damn funny. And if you are not into this kind of stuff, maybe the small romance scenes in the latter half might keep you interested. Either way from the very beginning this series sets its target audience, and if you belong in this audience i doubt you will be disappointed. For those who just cannot enjoy a more &quot;dirty&quot; type of humour, then you are looking for the wrong anime. With hopes of a possible second season, I can say with confidence &quot;I love Ousai, I love SYD&quot;.

    Hello :3<br />
<br />
This review is fully intended to all of you who&#039;s about to decide whether to watch this fine looking anime or not. Okay, so here goes...<br />
<br />
Seitokai Yakuindomo tells us about a normal-looking guy who&#039;s going to spend his 3 years of high school in a former all-girls school which has just gone co-ed. Suddenly he got recruited by the student council on the first day of school. Things went smooth for him, and then at some point, romantic flags comes appearing out of nowhere just like a cliched rom-com anime. <br />
<br />
If you think that&#039;s what going to happen in this anime, then you&#039;re a

Seitokai Yakuindomo is actually about a group of student council of an all-girls school that has just turned into a co-ed school. This group consist of 4 people, 3 girls and a guy.<br />
<br />
We have a diligent, smart, athletic president whose sex orientation is a bit screwed up, Amakusa Shino<br />
<br />
A beautiful, rich secretary whose having puberty problems just like the president, Shichijou Aria<br />
<br />
A tiny-looking girl who happens to be the treasurer, Hagimura Suzu<br />
<br />
And the normal, straight-man, main character, and also the vice president, Tsuda Takatoshi.<br />
<br />
Everyday in the student council room is day full of Tsuda&#039;s punchline reacting to the immaturity of Shino and Aria regarding sex. Anddd, sometimes it&#039;s just Suzu&#039;s insult to others when she&#039;s being teased tiny.<br />
<br />
Oh, before I forgot, this is a gag anime which consist of serial short skits. This anime contains lots of jokes related to sex. I suggest you to be an adult to watch this, or at least have a sufficient knowledge of sex. Personally, I watched this when I was younger and found some &quot;things&quot; hard to understand, such as dildos, chasity belt, masturbation and other stuff which is a completely unsuitable for Justin Bieber.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t really know if this could be considered funny or not. I mean, I laughed a bit, but so often it just keeps giving sex jokes which I couldn&#039;t really understand. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a rom-com anime, then you&#039;re definitely looking at the wrong place.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a comedy anime, I can&#039;t say that this anime is guaranteed to be funny, since some jokes are not for everybody.<br />
<br />
So, I could say that if you&#039;re a person with a reasonable knowledge of sex, and also a reasonable sense of humor, Seitokai Yakuindomo is &#039;maybe&#039; the right choice to watch.<br />

    SYD...if you&#039;re looking for a good laugh, this is definitely one of the best out there. Full of shocking and vulgar sex jokes, there is no filter on the mouths of these hilarious characters as they try to live the life of high school students while controlling their unmatched sex drives. <br />
<br />
Story (7/10): <br />
The story itself is pretty simple. Tsuda Takatoshi is a new student at Ousai Academy and he is accidentally forced to join the student council (all girls) by day one. What he doesn&#039;t know is just how perverted the president and vice president are of this council. Whether it&#039;s discussing how to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review172755">
        experiment S&amp;M on teddy bears or pester Takotshi about how many times he &quot;finishes&quot; per day, there is no rest for Takotshi as he tries to keep up with the seemingly unlimited energy of the council. <br />
The weakness of this kind of comedy, however, is that there really is no central plot. Each episode is self-contained and does nothing more than set up the situation for the jokes, so anyone looking for a profound story, a slice-of-life, or even a school romance will be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Art (9/10):<br />
Good animation. Nothing worth noting.<br />
<br />
Sound (8/10): <br />
Thought the opening and ending themes were pretty good. Nothing super spectacular.<br />
<br />
Character (8/10):<br />
There&#039;s no doubt these characters were hilarious. Coupled with Takatoshi and Hagimura&#039;s stunned reactions, these characters will keep you entertained from start to finish. Do not worry that the jokes are only sexual; they honestly don&#039;t get old. But this is all assuming we look at these characters from a comedic perspective. Once again, there aren&#039;t any deep background stories or in-depth looks at their personal struggles; this is no slice-of-life. It is pure comedy.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10/10):<br />
I thought this show was hysterical. I never found the jokes repetitive since they were so shocking; unfiltered vulgarity  has its own charm. Even if you&#039;re not a fan of sexual jokes, I suggest you give this type of humor a try. <br />
<br />
Overall (8/10):<br />
Approach this show as if you would approach a stand-up comedy: don&#039;t expect any deep stories, expect comedy and you will receive.  <br />

    Ignoring Sound.  I will get straight to the point.  This all base on my opinion, so even if I like or hate it, you still might love this series.  :)  I just love writing reviews.  I gave it a 8 on Story mostly because there is only 2 episodes out and I do not know what the plot will be.  So far, this show is pure comical action through perverted jokes made my the Shino (Mio from K-on!) and Aria (Ritsu from K-on!).  Now however, if some of you guys are watching it for Yoko and Satomi, sadly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review28308">
        Aria has more of a higher voice than Ritsu and Shino, is well more perverted than Mio will ever be. lol Their characters are nothing similar.<br />
<br />
I like all the character personality, since it&#039;s comedy, I expect them to make me laugh, or at least make me smile lol.  Anyways, so far the jokes aren&#039;t bad, but I hope they don&#039;t rely solely on perverted jokes alone.  I didn&#039;t really like it the first time I watched it because after watching K-on... it threw me off that Mio&#039;s voice was a perverted personality lol.  So watch the first episode, and try to erase Mio&#039;s character.  You might enjoy the perverted comedy, or maybe you may pass :)

    Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD): Student Council mixed with a lot of sex related jokes<br />
<br />
The series starts with a normal male student Tsuda Takatoshi who is about to start his first year at Ousai Academy but on his first day he pretty much forced into the student council and that&#039;s when the fun starts. After that you see what happens in the student council, the adventures they go on and the time they spend together<br />
<br />
Although this anime has no plot (because of it&#039;s genre), it was really enjoyable (if you are into sex related jokes).  About 90-95% of the jokes in this anime were sex-related and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30834">
        they had me laughing a lot even though I find them somewhat repetitive.  The concept of this anime seems really simple but it works.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t anything too special, we got Shino the student body president, who is perfect (except for that one flaw), Aria the rich girl, Suzu the loli and a whole bunch of minor characters.  Sure the characters might not be unique but they all fit into their roles and that&#039;s all I ask for.  In this kind of anime there really wouldn&#039;t be any character development but there are one or two love interests flying around, but the anime isn&#039;t really too heavy on it, I guess it&#039;s because of the genre. However it would be nice if they did have some romance but I guess that&#039;s asking for too much.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is clear and they do have some moments where the characters are in chibi version but nothing too special and nothing negative either<br />
<br />
As for the sound there is nothing too special here either, the voice actors are alright and I would say fit the role, the OP and ED songs are at par.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed this series quite a bit, I got to say this is one of the funniest anime series I&#039;ve watched this year.  If you&#039;re not into sex-related jokes then I would bypass this anime but if you just want a laugh like me I recommend SYD. Thanks for reading.

    &quot;Oh god another harem anime revolving around one male student that transfers into an all girls school?&quot; If you&#039;re thinking this way before watching this anime let me tell you, it&#039;s absolutely not even close to that.<br />
<br />
This anime completely ditched the female stereotypes of anime and created some of the most outrageous female characters. Also this series is not a harem for those of you who cling onto that cliché.<br />
<br />
This anime revolves around sexual based humor, the amount of sexual innuendos and sexual jokes is just absurd and what&#039;s more surprising is they never come from the male character which you&#039;d expect to be a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98843">
        pervert, on the contrary, he&#039;s annoyed every single day by the amount of pervertedness existing in both the student council president and the school counsil secretary.<br />
<br />
The setting of the show is pretty unusual for this type of humor which is the student council room, you&#039;d expect them all to be strict people that set rules and punish those who don&#039;t follow them, well they also do that but the amount of immorality is defenitely not of a student counsil and that&#039;s what makes this show so entertaining. The jokes are creative and the atmosphere they&#039;re in  just makes the humor come out even more.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s start with all the aspects of the series so this can be a full review.<br />
<br />
The Story (6/10)<br />
I have a problem with this, although the show is entertaining and funny, there&#039;s no actual storyline happening, in fact, each episode could be devided into 2 or 3 different stories, even though each story is of course structured the events in each episode are pretty much randomly inserted and the focus of the show is really to just make people laugh with all the sexual innuendos. The humor was there, most defenitely but the fact that they focused more on that rather than building an actual story line let me kind of disappointed, it would have been very fullfiling to see character development and such but the truth is the episodes are just random even though they do follow a chrological order there&#039;s not many connecting elements which, for me is kind of a down side to this show, but nonetheless it gets a 6/10<br />
<br />
The art (7/10)<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about this, the character design is pretty simple and since there&#039;s a lot of humor moments there&#039;s the use of chibi-like characters which fit into the atmosphere pretty well so i don&#039;t think they got the art wrong, it&#039;s adequate for this show, the colors are lively and overall nothing&#039;s really unproportional or bad looking, so a 7/10<br />
<br />
The Sound (7/10)<br />
I don&#039;t really have much to say about this, there&#039;s not that much music going on during the actual episode, the opening theme is pretty fitting, so is the ending, they&#039;re not songs that would pump me up and make me go &quot;Yes! it&#039;s starting!&quot; so judging only these facts i&#039;ll give it a 7/10<br />
<br />
The Characters (9/10)<br />
Now this, this is where this show gets all the points, the characters completely  destroy the usual stereotypes of anime such as innocent girls and an ultra perverted guy who wants to create a harem, if you want a reference i&#039;d say this anime is like the opposite of &quot;Seitokai No Ichizon&quot;. You have 3 girls in the student council and 1 guy. The president is a dominant freak who misunderstands everyhting and turns it into something sexual, she&#039;s  constantly proposing weird stuff in the council meetings which pretty much don&#039;t even mix with whhat a student council is supposed to do. Then we have the secretary, a nice looking &quot;onee-chan&quot; type character, but don&#039;t let this fool you, she&#039;s the most perverted of all of them, she&#039;s a rich girl who freely talks about everything including the fact she uses tampons. Then we have the &quot;loli&quot; member of the council, probably one of the smartest and has a huge complex with her height, she&#039;s more of a stereotype but nonetheless she&#039;s a character that doesn&#039;t really understand what&#039;s going on when the others talk about bras,tampons, etc. And then we have our poor guy, forced to join the council as soon as he enters the now co-ed school and is the only guy who makes the others come to their senses, he&#039;s the opposite of a pervert and feels offended every time the girls turn him into a sexual object. The enjoyment of the show is the mixture between the girl&#039;s pervertedness and the guy&#039;s replies to those, that&#039;s what creates a humurous atmosphere and for that reason the characters get a 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8/10)<br />
This is a series to make you laugh, not to create an emotional attachement with the viewers. The humour is based off of almost only sexual jokes and innuendos and for the right audience this can be pretty entertaining but be warned if you don&#039;t like pervertedness, especially in girls, this is not the right show for you.<br />
<br />
Overall (7/10)<br />
Overall  this series is one of those you watch  on your free time or a series to bright up your day after a more intense anime, it&#039;s supposed to make you laugh if you have a perverted mind but beware this is not ecchi based, there&#039;s no pantsu or oppai this is really just revolving around sexual jokes and innuendos although of course some revolve around breasts and panties there&#039;s no actual breasts or panties on-screen. The characters will defenitely motivate you if you&#039;re into this type of humour because they&#039;re just so unique and i promise you this will make you laugh if you don&#039;t have an innocent mind. <br />

    If something came to me after watching Setokai Yakuindomo (SYD) it was that I never figured out if the male lead is gay or not. That, and the fact society sure is changing fast these days. Maybe GoHands was better off restoring their mistake and making Princess Lover into a H series again.<br />
<br />
Summarizing this series, let&#039;s take B Gata H Kei as example. Remove the shyness about adult subjects and instead make it the most common subject to talk about in the world. Replace the cast, add in a very mediocre soundtrack, reduce the art a bit and you&#039;re done. Welcome to SYD. <br />
<br />
The plot.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30990">
        Pure and innocent guy Tsuda transfers to an all-girl school to find out sex jokes do not get a &#039;what are you talking about o0..&#039; reaction but rather &#039;I think it feels better there while doing ***&#039; with serious face-- you get the idea. During the 13 episodes this series spans you will get coverage of all possible adult jokes you&#039;re going to hear on the short term. If you hear them that is, between all censoring and *bleep* words. And no, there will be no pantsu on the DVD either according to the anime.<br />
<br />
The only thing I remembered about art and soundtrack is that some scenes were straight default H game rips, with the classroom at sunset with dramatic music to the school grounds and everything. <br />
Characters are there, but predictable. After two eps you can already tell in what state of mind corruption everyone is, not a bad thing since that&#039;s all what matters here.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, watch SYD for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1.) Test if your mindset is past the point of no return yet. <br />
You pass when you can guess how a joke is going to play out with a small hint. <br />
You fail when..well, you actually can&#039;t fail. 13 eps full of dirty jokes boast a pretty high success rate. If you are among the group that still has a pure mind after watching this, drop a line on my profile. I&#039;ll be waiting for you, my Savior.<br />
<br />
2.) You have spare time and need a good laugh. With BSDM Teddybears, no pantsu and vibrators from Santa pretty much everything passes by.<br />
<br />
P.S. I took a long break from writing reviews. Does it show?
