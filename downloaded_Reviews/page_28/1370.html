    In the recent past, there have been an influx of media portraying stories in which the characters tackle social issues, some successful, some unsuccessful. Most of them do invoke some sort of emotion from the viewers because at least some of the scenarios in them do have a realistic aspect which people can relate to. <br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora is more of a drama than a sports anime. The sports aspect of the shows is more of a background theme while the core of it portrays how our characters manage the problems they face in their daily lives. I started watching this anime after 3 episodes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324833">
        had already aired, and watching those 3 at once had me excited and anticipating a very, very good sports drama anime that had a fair bit of realism. <br />

And it didn’t disappoint. Well, for the most part of the show at least. The problems with Hoshiai no Sora began to surface once it was revealed that each and every one on the main and supporting cast had problems with their parents in one way or another. It was intriguing to watch the two main leads face their problems and develop in the first few episodes, but as the show went on, the backgrounds of the other characters surfaced, and that was when the show began to go downhill for me.<br />
<br />
The soft tennis club of the Shijo Minami Middle School is underperforming and on the verge of being disbanded even though their captain, Toma Shinjou, is an extremely dedicated and gifted player. As Maki Katsuragi transfers to their school, Toma, sees that he might be the one to change the fortunes of the club, and not just save it from being disbanded, but also make it good enough for them to compete in tournaments. Much to Toma’s dismay, Maki has no interest in soft tennis at all, and neither does he have the time. Toma eventually managed to “buy” the services of Maki by promising him money to play, and he agrees. This might seem desperate from Toma, but the boys’ team seriously sucked. Their team is so bad that they constantly get thrashed by their girls’ team, granted the girls’ team are national champions. Thus, begins their quest to get the boys’ soft tennis club revitalized and competing in tournament while facing their own personal issues.<br />
<br />
The plot had me fascinated instantly because it was a breath of fresh air and miles away from “unsuited for a particular sport main character has certain good skills that he uses to compete against better suited (usually taller) players” narrative. The drama just added an extra layer of intrigue to it. We had a duo of competent main characters who each had their own reasons for playing soft tennis, faced problems that actually did make sense and had brains, not just skill in the sport.<br />
<br />
But after 6 or so episodes, I realized where the anime was heading. By then, it was revealed how most of the cast faced various problem at home. A few characters having some problems with their parents? Interesting and believable. All the characters having problems at home? Unrealistic with too much drama that wasn’t required in an anime that had so much going for it already.<br />
<br />
Let’s start off with the main lead, Maki Katsuragi. He’s recently moved into a new apartment with his mom and transfers into the school. From the very beginning, he’s shown to have unbelievable reflexes, managing to adapt to soft tennis like fish to water. He’s an all-round guy who’s not just great at physical activities, but also has a shrewd mind. The only problem he has is that his father is a good for nothing bastard who only comes home once in a while to get money. He’s very close to a Gary Stu but he does have a couple things even he has issues with. I enjoyed watching him to be honest simply for the reason that most sports anime protagonist are the same: dense, thick, stupid, and have something they’re great at while being short.<br />
<br />
Then, the deuteragonist, Toma Shinjou, the captain of the soft tennis club. He’s talented at the sport but he struggles because soft tennis is a pair sport and the soft tennis club doesn’t have the perfect pair for him. He too, has problems at home, although this time, it’s with his mother. He doesn’t have too much else worth mentioning but he does form an interesting dynamic with Maki.<br />
<br />
Kanako Mitsue is a girl in Toma and Maki’s class who also stays in the same building as Maki. She’s an unsociable girl who spends most of her time observing people and calling the boys’ soft tennis club for putting in effort and failing. She develops a nice chemistry with Maki, and it’s nice to watch her grow closer to the club, and put in some effort for them. <br />
<br />
We’ve then got the rest of the soft tennis club in the cast, and all of them have issues with their family. One has a mother who had traumatized him in his childhood, one finds out he lives with foster parents who had adopted him, one is non binary and this isn’t accepted by his mother, one has an overprotective mother while the father only knows how to work and didn’t take his parenting classes in school, another has a father who doesn’t accept him playing soft tennis, one has parents who’re so deluded that they tell him that if he loses, it won’t be through no fault of his own but because he had a shitty partner, and lastly one has a step mother who doesn’t like him.<br />
<br />
This is the problem with the show. I was loving Hoshiai no Sora until most of this was revealed. Even then, I still liked the show as a whole but come on, you can’t expect me to take anything like this seriously. The drama was nice when 3-4 characters were shown to have problems while the others seemed to be helping them overcome those. But when everyone in a sports club has problems with their parents, then it starts to become a problem for the show. <br />
<br />
The art is very neat and I loved the style but the animation left a lot of holes. The sports scenes in matches are very poorly animated. I say this because none of the matches in the entire show had a continuous animation scene. It was all broken down into one side then the other. You’ll understand what I mean if you watch a full match. Sports anime do require good animation and this was an area that definitely failed to impress. The OST and OP/ED are good without leaving an impression on me. Overall, I think the production could have been better but I don’t like to complain too much about it. As I’ve said, Hoshiai no Sora is more a drama/Slice of Life than it is a sports anime and maybe the studio produced it keeping that in mind?<br />
<br />
Hoshiai na Sora is a story of wasted potential. The plot was very unique and had me excited for the most part of the season, but the unrealistic drama really killed it. It tried too hard to be realistic and this was the product of that. Would I recommend this? Yes, and no. If you want to watch a sports drama with a slightly different setup, give this a try. If you can&#039;t stand overdramatic shit, you should probably stay away from this.<br />
<br />

    Hoshiai no Sora could be a gem. I must admit that this series differs from other sports series thanks to its realistic setting and its themes. This series will talk about dysfunctional families, domestic abuses, difficulties about social pressure and also gender identity issues. For these reasons, Hoshiai no Sora can not leave you indifferent, whether you agree or not with the purpose of the anime, i think this show is at least thought-provoking<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora is not really a typical sports anime. Sports is not the main theme but a way to develop characters, their interactions and their evolution. Anyway, Hoshiai doesn&#039;t follow the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324836">
        way of most sports shounen. No, there are no idealized dreams with characters wishing to achieve perfection and become the best in their sports. You will understand with the synopsis that Hoshiai doesn&#039;t have this intention.<br />
<br />
Unlike their female colleagues, the boys&#039; soft tennis club fails to achieve positive results. Meanwhile, Maki Katsuragi, a new transfer student, shows great reflexes when he catches a stray cat. Toma Shinjou, the soft tennis club captain, realizes Maki&#039;s potential and asks him to join the club. Maki does not want to join any club but following repetitive requests, he accepts if Toma pays him for his participation and club expenses.<br />
<br />
Maki joins the club and finds that the members of the club aren&#039;t very motivated to work. The pairs are inefficient during games and the members don&#039;t have a good chemistry. Maki is completely inexperienced but learns very quickly. The other members are both surprised but also jealous and irritated by Maki&#039;s behavior.<br />
It is true that Maki is very frank and can seem abrupt. So he brings many changes to the club. He works mainly on strategy and observes his opponents to decide the best strategy, so he gradually gains consideration from his teammates.<br />
Regarding the other characters, most of them are highlighted and have a few important moments, whether during their club activity or outside of school. For the most part, they are at first very little motivated but gain confidence with the effectiveness of Maki&#039;s strategies.<br />
<br />
There are also characters that don&#039;t belong to the club and that get a significant screentime. The most memorable being Mitsue Kanako who is probably one of the most intriguing characters in this series. We don&#039;t really know why she assists the club without being a member (No, the manager is not a girl this time !) but you will regularly hear her edged comments throughout the series. We could quickly consider her as a creepy depressed girl but I can assure you that her development is just as interesting as her personality.<br />
<br />
This series also showcases their life outside the club. It was really nice to see the characters outside of the sports environment. Since they are not only people obsessed with sports, but like you and me, these characters also have the worries of everyday life. And I have to admit that even if the ideas are very interesting for the most part, their integration is not really satisfactory.<br />
<br />
Indeed, this series contains many, many dramas. There are so many that it becomes predictable. After half of the series, you quickly understand that each character will have his drama at some point in the series. Unfortunately, 12 episodes are not enough to develop dramas for all the characters in the best way.<br />
The storytelling is therefore awkward, we have the impression that the dramas follow one another without logical connection. The original creator, Akane Kazuki, seems to have written a story too long for 12 episodes. Thus we have a lot of dramas with no real resolution. For example, Maki&#039;s father, he was quite present at the start of the series. Shinjou even threatened him so we could expect a possible quick confrontation. I won&#039;t reveal to you but it is probably one of the most frustrating conclusions. And I can give you other similar examples with other characters. Some characters&#039; backgrounds make feel me indifferent because the characters don&#039;t have a significant screentime. I don&#039;t have time to feel involved in fifteen characters&#039; dramas in this series. And please, stop the post-ending drama scenes. Doing it once or twice can be surprising but it becomes too repetitive and they give the impression of cheap dramas.<br />
Hoshiai no Sora could be an excellent series but the drama was too excessive that I felt less and less involved.<br />
<br />
(Regarding the end, it is obvious that it gives up many subplots and the last drama is frustrating. I guess Akane Kazuki wanted more episodes but the production committees probably limited to 12 episodes.)<br />
<br />
Technically, we have a solid production. The most memorable point is probably the ending. The animation and the choreographies are fantastic (but please don&#039;t forget to warn the choreographers before using their works !). The animation of the series is excellent, especially on services and receptions during games. But I regret that we get little information regarding the ball directions, so it is not easy to understand the whole game.<br />
The soundtrack is a perfect accompaniment to dramas although my favorites are the piano songs.<br />
<br />
In the end, Hoshiai no Sora was a refreshing experience. Showing characters outside the sports setting allowed us to explore very interesting themes, but I would have liked to feel more interested in dramas which unfortunately are omnipresent and turn out to be more boring when you see that any secondary character from this series also has family problems. In 12 episodes, it wasn&#039;t enough to develop everything, the storytelling was over the top on the second part. If you want similar experiences, I would recommend that you read or watch works by Mitsuru Adachi that perfectly combine three genres: slice of life, drama and sports. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru could also interest you. And if you are curious about gender identity issues, you can watch Hourou Musuko or read Shimanami Tasogare.

    This review contains spoilers <br />
(tl;dr at the end)<br />
<br />
Since the last year, I have been trying to find that one anime every season. Yeah, maybe you know it: that one who has &quot;Source: Original&quot; in its description, flies under the radar for the most viewers who prefer sequels of the already popular shows, and has a potential to become something unique. Original anime means that you don&#039;t need to try to adapt 50 chapters of the manga or 4 volumes of the light novel into 12-episode format, to create original ending or give your anime no ending at all, to cut a lot of storylines and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324832">
        the character development from the source material — because the source material for this one is only the imagination of the scriptwriter. And, honestly, I hate it. I always hate when original anime with a curious premise disappoints me. RErideD, Fairy Gone, Bem, Tokunana — all of them have decent ideas in their basis and horrible realizations of them.<br />
<br />
Of course, HoshiSora (or Stars Align in the English version) is a lot better than all those abominations, but it is still not enough to become something enjoyable. Pilot episode from this &quot;Fall 2019 sleeper hit that isn&#039;t your average sports anime&quot; was really well-done and gave me high hopes for something fresh in the sports genre — but this show became an average slice-of-life with horrible forced drama really soon. Sad bad true, once again. So, what went wrong?<br />
<br />
In the first episode, we meet our main characters. We have a school soft tennis club — a bunch of losers with a useless coach and zero motivation to improve themselves, the leader of this club, Toma, who already in despair because he can&#039;t change anything, and Maki, transfer student and a potentially good player with a talent who can become a savior for a team. Sounds like a generic sports anime, right? Maybe, but the direction of this episode was really great. Conflicts between Toma, his team, and a school council, dialogues between Toma and Maki (&quot;pay for play&quot;), first interactions between Maki and neighbor girl — all of that was really well-done, with the usage of &quot;show, don&#039;t tell&quot; rule and some direction tricks. Add a pretty good animation, comfy music, and, of course, surprising ending with Maki&#039;s abusive father - and you will get the best pilot episode of the season. What this show will be? A &quot;not your average sports&quot; anime? A realistic drama? A romance between Maki and that girl whose name I don&#039;t know? I was excited and asked for more... and got this.<br />
<br />
Realistic sports anime? Not really. After joining the team, Maki suddenly becomes literally a god of soft tennis. One practice - and he already knows how to play. Two — and Maki/Toma pair destroys all other club members. A few days - and in the ep 2, he becomes an actual leader of the team and a great strategist. He provides a manager to a club, he already knows how other members of the team must play, what tactics they should choose, their strong and weak points and how to improve their results - and yeah, it works! All the players in the club suddenly started to play a way better — and in the match against one of the top soft tennis schools in the prefecture (episode 5-6), the soft tennis club is playing with them like they are equal!<br />
<br />
Really, scriptwriters? Yeah, I can understand why Maki became a solid player after only a few pieces of training. Maybe, he is a genius, he has a talent or something like that — yeah, cliche, but why not. However, how Maki suddenly received his strategical skills? In the pilot episode, we&#039;ve got that Maki and his mother have moved numerous times before because they&#039;ve been trying to escape from Maki&#039;s abusive father. So, a guy who don&#039;t have any close friends (because he changed a lot of schools), who was often bullied by his father (domestic abuse, yay), who is unsociable (episode 5 and how Maki speaks with Toma in his house)... actually becomes a coach and a psychologist who knows all weak points of his team and how to improve it? How to speak with all members and how to train them? Are you kidding me? And yeah, all problems in their playstyle were successfully resolved because of Maki. He is a genius! He is perfect! He is... just a typical Gary Stu, honestly.<br />
<br />
And what about the &quot;pay to play&quot; idea? I thought that Maki will be talented, but an unsociable player who doesn&#039;t care about this team, who acts like &quot;I play just for the money&quot;. Or, for example, money for the game will become a drive who develops relationships between Maki and his father. What have we actually got? Nothing again. Maki is already a very friendly player who always helps the team, so in ep 5 was the last time when this idea was mentioned, the same as the Maki/Kenji relationships. After the fifth episode and Toma&#039;s defense, Maki&#039;s father just went out of the house... and never come back. Great job!<br />
<br />
Exciting tennis matches? Not here again. All members of the club weren&#039;t revealed at all (except our main pair Maki/Toma), so all of their matches look like &quot;undeveloped characters vs cardboard opponents&quot;. Add here the fact that tennis (especially pair soft tennis) isn&#039;t as exciting as more traditional sports in anime (football, basketball, etc), and all that you got is just some dull matches between bland characters. Nothing interesting and nothing awesome, most of the matches (except maybe some Maki/Toma ones) was simply a boring mess.<br />
<br />
Maybe this show is not a sports anime, but a heavy teen drama? Yeah, right. It&#039;s a teen drama — one of the laziest and annoying examples of it that I&#039;ve ever seen in anime. All parents in HoshiSora are abusive and hate soft tennis. Every member of the club just has a random dramatic background. One of them is illegitimate, second has step-mother who abuse him, third has a helicopter mom who hates tennis, fourth has mother who poured boiling water on him when he was a child... drama, drama, drama, a bunch of random conflicts that haven&#039;t any development at all because this show has only 12 episodes and that&#039;s not enough time to successfully solve them. All of these conflicts just don&#039;t bother me at all — &quot;Oh, another forced drama and another abusive parent&#039;s background story, how interesting&quot;. Because of it, all the characters in this show (except Maki and Toma) seem so bland that I even hadn&#039;t remembered their names. Random LGBT themes? Child abuse? Also here. Because what else do we need for the forced drama? Seriously, even Akame ga Kill&#039;s deaths were way more dramatic and touching than any of the background stories about these characters.<br />
<br />
A romance? Mmm... we have a girl who likes to watch tennis and draw something about it. She exists. That&#039;s all.<br />
We have a student council president. She also exists (we even saw one random flashback about her). That&#039;s all.<br />
LGBT romance? Well, one of the characters is gay. Why? Just because. That&#039;s also all.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#039;s a slice of life anime? Yeah, most of the SoL moments were really well done. Good animation, comfy visual style, relationships between Maki and Toma, Maki and the girl, the team and their opponents are actually the best part of the show. However, even those moments don&#039;t make the show better. After a comfy moment, we got another forced drama. After well-done dialogues between characters - another shitty dramatic flashback. Nothing enjoyable here again.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Hoshiai no Sora is just a trainwreck. It has cute animation, some good slice-of-life elements and interactions between members of the club, fine music (op and ed), but all of that was ruined by shitty forced drama, incompetent writing, and Gary Stu as the main character. Wanna see good tennis anime? Watch Teekyuu, it has a way better character development.

    First off: I really think this show will be the best this season. From deep characters to an enrapturing story, this original has it all.<br />
<br />
STORY: 9<br />
The story of Stars Align is centered around a middle school boy named Katsuragi Maki. He moves schools and gets convinced by his friend to join the school&#039;s failing soft tennis club because of his athletic ability, despite never playing soft tennis before. From there, it seems like it will become a generic sports/drama, but there is a darker side to the story which reveals itself after the ending of the first episode, and the show starts touching on conflicts

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321102">
        many people are afraid to talk about. On the outside, Katsuragi is a normal student who is part of the soft tennis club, but on the inside, he is a helpless boy, trapped by the trauma of his past.<br />
<br />
ART: 7<br />
The art style of this show is decent. The animation and drawing are perfectly fine, yet nothing especially stands out. However, I really enjoy the character design. The bright backgrounds are also very nice-looking, and the OP is animated very well. The ED is also very funny, with rotoscoped dance moves that *cough* &quot;may have&quot; been stolen without the creators&#039; permission *cough*... nonetheless, I enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 8<br />
Speaking of OPs and EDs, I really enjoy the sound of this show. The OP and ED are both very good, and the OST is also enjoyable to listen to. The sound design is also decent, and listening to this show is very satisfying with good stereo headphones. The voice acting is also very good, as they hired very capable and established voice actors.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 9<br />
One of the best aspects of this show is the characters. 8bit was able to craft a variety of interesting characters, from the assertive Katsuragai and Shinjou to the shy Taiyou and Mitsue. The character development is incredible. Each character in the cast has their own unique quirks and troubles. From questioning their own identities, having family troubles, being antisocial, and more, many of the characters are relatable and much of the show is spent developing these characters. I guarantee most of you (regardless of sexuality, race, or situation) reading this review will be able to connect with at least one of the characters in this show. The amount of care put into crafting these characters is apparent, and as I mentioned before, the character designs are amazing.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 10<br />
I really enjoy watching this show. The rollercoaster of emotions I go through in one episode leaves me thinking about it for a while after I watch it. From the rebuilding of the soft tennis club to the darker themes present, I can honestly say that so far I have enjoyed every minute of Stars Align. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: 9<br />
As I mentioned before, I really do think this will be the best show of the season. Stars Align is the show I look forward to most the whole week. The combination of the deep story and the amazing character development makes me want to recommend this to everyone. Give this show a try, and make sure you watch the post ED scenes. I promise you you won&#039;t regret it.

    This show truly has the definition of &quot;don&#039;t judge a book by its cover&quot;, because it ain&#039;t just a sports anime, but one that is rife with the daily affluences of family drama and matters that&#039;s spread all over it. And knowing director Kazuki Akane on this show&#039;s influence taken mostly from his creation of &quot;Noein&quot; and planning this original story for over a decade, I&#039;d say that while this has caused A HELL LOT of backlash, like Satoshi Mizukani&#039;s Planet With, the end result is truly the icing on the cake, whether you&#039;d decide to take it literally or not, I believe that what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324837">
        Akane-san wanted out of it, he truly accomplished it to its feet with his unorthodox method of storytelling.<br />
<br />
You must be wondering why the title literally says &quot;Stars Align&quot;, but it&#039;s Kazuki Akane&#039;s way of foreshadowing that no human is ever perfect, and we&#039;re like the stars of the sky, when life beats us down harsh, the common interest in question (soft tennis) aligns us in the thread of fate, that is adolescent trauma (which happens to be his favourite theme). Being grown-ups, the world that they know is never a bed of roses, so the harsh reality of families growing through the different pangs and uncertainties must know how to counteract on their very own. While the school/soft tennis club part is there to help expose and alleviate their true natures of the sufferings going through with parental disabilities, or expectations as simply you would call it, all kinds of nature are laid in bare sight. What these adolescent teens (i.e. Maki, Toma and the others) must do is not to take that emotional attachment and let it be the ridiculing point of their lives, but rather, no matter how much understanding others may have on their struggles, it&#039;s the reconciliation that leads to the amalgation of their feelings and work it out to experience their joy (which again, is in the soft tennis club) as an output.<br />
<br />
And to this point, all the dysfunctional boys in the Shijo Minami Boy&#039;s soft tennis team, budding artist but introverted and bullied Kanako Mitsue, and Kinuyo Kasuga the student council president, all face different but similar parental dysfunctions that affect them both physically and mentally, but not without some help from the same outside community that was once split but now bonded with understanding and acceptance, to push past their fears and limitations to be the best they could be. Even the worst of issues have a silver lining that despite how much relentlessness was given, any amount of joy would overcome the overglaringly terror and rebuild it into something special. All were alone, but the least of forgivings were not enough to separate each and every single member to reunite and conquer these harsh battles together.<br />
<br />
Studio 8-bit&#039;s visuals have never looked so better, especially with the soft tennis matches that seem to glide by every so often with the amount of exceptional precision and realism. While the overall stance is decent, the character designs are one that pops out in the slew of recognizing who&#039;s who and what&#039;s what, being that informative for reasons I cannot fathom, but with the puzzle pieces put together, paints a canvas that excels better than my initial thoughts about what this could be. Light-hearted visuals but not without the more serious moments (a.k.a parent-child arguments) make this one of those shows that stand out for reasons.<br />
<br />
And speaking of the music, I do enjoy the music and sounds of the show, with some realistic voice acting in the parental issues and OP and ED (of which the former comes VERY often), playing into sound design of the show that&#039;s just well done IMO. Always been a fan of Megumi Nakajima&#039;s music and this OP shows, while the ED&#039;s music is also good, and the dance...let&#039;s just say that copyrighted material needs to be attended to foremost.<br />
<br />
More than just a realistic drama-ified anime, Kazuki Akane&#039;s Hoshiai no Sora brings one important point to start and end its story: &quot;Wherever you are in life, everyone goes through thick and thin, and it takes two hands to clap, so grab a partner that can help spur each other&#039;s life forward and achieve things you couldn&#039;t have imagined you&#039;d accomplish.&quot; Love it or hate it, Stars Align truly will forever be misunderstood under Akane-san&#039;s direction, but for those who got the gist of it, make your life count, and keep moving forward.

    Hoshiai no Sora (Stars Align) is a tennis based anime that may catch you by surprise.  That’s because it takes a realistic approach towards competitive athletics, in ways that most shonen won’t accommodate.  That’s not to say that shows like Haikyuu!! are bad — in fact, I rather enjoyed it — it’s just that they usually give the main protagonist a special advantage that would otherwise not exist in the real world.  Also, the plot usually follows a predictable pattern, in which the team uplifts itself from obscurity to unquestioned greatness.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora, on the other hand, gives the impression that this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321111">
        tennis team will improve over the course of twelve episodes, but will, most likely, experience more setbacks than victories.  In addition, the characters are proving to be quite complex, with emotional, social and physical barriers that are hindering their forward progress.<br />
<br />
Toma, for example, is struggling with his role as team captain, and can’t seem to motivate his teammate or get them to rally together.  This is causing him a great deal of frustration and stress, which is leading to physical outbursts.  Combine this with his poor relationship with his mother (who shows little-to-interest in him), and he’s an extremely troubled character.  Maki is becoming overwhelmed by his responsibilities at home, and his abusive father is not making his life any easier (quite the opposite).  That being said, his unwillingness to be a ‘loser,’ despite his difficulties is inspiring, but his lack of sensitivity towards his teammates ‘loser mindset’ is cause a rift in the soft tennis club.  <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the team, it seems as though many, if not all, of them are socially or emotionally oppressed individuals, that feel maligned by the other sports clubs, and student body as a whole.  Thus far, their awkwardness and socially repressed personalities are realistic, and it will be interesting to see if they allow the ridicule of others to influence their behaviors, or if they’ll gain the self-confidence to blossom into self-confident individuals.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora’s animation is simple.  That is not meant to be disparaging, however.  That’s because the animation beautiful compliments the solemn atmosphere of the show.  Sometimes, a rich color palette can take the viewer out of the experience, preventing them from fully empathizing with the characters.  But when the colors are muted, if you will, events seem more grounded, allowing the viewer to establish a deeper connection with the characters on screen.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I’m thoroughly enjoying the events of Hoshiai no Sora, and believe it’s the hidden gem of the 2019 fall season.

    Well, First Of all The Anime was Axed At 12 episodes by the production company even though the director wanted 24 episodes to Completely Tell the Story. So when he was given opportunity to choose either one from fast pace of story or Leave it at half he chose to keep at decent page and leave it Half. <br />
<br />
Now coming To the Anime Review, <br />
If you are suggested to watch the anime based on Sports Genre what you found was Half Correct. Coz this Anime is 50% Sports 50% Drama. <br />
<br />
But This anime is Off the chart with mind blowing character Development and surrounding coverage.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324852">
        <br />
Don&#039;t listen to anyone else if you have time for 12 episodes watch This anime and give me Like If you Found my review Helpful

    Really wanted to like this one, but 3 episodes in and it isn&#039;t getting much better.<br />
<br />
To start off with, it&#039;s a beautiful anime, I loved the art in some places and it was top notch everywhere. The character design is a bit too soft for my taste but the characters are distinct enough and consistent. The sound is also great. <br />
<br />
The character development on the other hand is lagging. They mix a decent perception of realism with some absurd elements. For example it seems all the characters suffer some form of hardship, and I&#039;m talking some cases of serious abuse, but then they channel all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321779">
        that emotional energy into... tennis club. I&#039;m willing to make some concessions given its an anime, but still. <br />
<br />
Its evident most of the club members are just in the club for fun, they&#039;re not all that invested in it, but then of course there&#039;s the Mary Sue who comes in and is excellent right off the bat, not only that, but the leaders of the club make it a point to let all the other club members know how pathetic they are. The vibe I&#039;m getting from this anime is that the golden boy comes in, with a sad backstory, beats everyone up and mocks them. But then he learns their own sad stories and helps them so of course everyone starts to love him. They struggle as a team, then wins some competition. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s just not how people work. It&#039;s weird the newcomer is so good, and it&#039;s doubly weird the club members are so accepting of the mockery, in all fairness I&#039;d have just joined another club. They simply don&#039;t have believable character dynamics, they have very intense emotional arcs, but then everything is warped because they so badly want to insert the whole Mary Sue thing. <br />
<br />
If you want a much better examination of athletes, watch Ping Pong The Animation, it does what this anime is trying to do but so much better. <br />
<br />

    Changed my review from 9 to 7. Derived from the episodes I&#039;ve seen so far. I just had a feeling I exaggerated too much.<br />
<br />
STORY:<br />
The boy&#039;s soft tennis club faces dissolution due to the lack of results and skill. Desperate for new members with athletic ability, Toma Shinjo leads a recruitment drive and come up empty. He approaches the transfer student Maki Katsuragi, but Maki declines not wanting to join any clubs. Toma follows Maki around not giving up on recruiting him and Maki agrees under the condition that he gets paid. Well, it is a sports anime. Expect flaws, the story overall is quite a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321871">
        cliche. Believing they would soon put on a twist. I further on have really nothing to say except for it is fine. Not unique or really exciting. It&#039;s your typical sports anime, oops I forgot it focuses on Drama. My bad, well, it really handles the dramas quite well. But too much abusive parents isn&#039;t surprising or dramatic anymore. Further information about the characters is within the Characters Section.<br />
<br />
ART:<br />
8Bit&#039;s art is quite too simple though cute. Even when the characters are serious in playing, I sometimes find it cute. Nothing really stands out. A bit wanky at some scenes. Though as for 2019, it lacks a feeling of improvement. It&#039;s um, bland at felt like flat. I&#039;m really hoping they would soon improve.<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
The OP is beautiful, quite catchy. It really tells off that what you are watching is a sports anime, deriving from rackets. The ED serves as for me, a comedic role that I cant just skip but watch. The teamwork between the OST is fascinating. Great job.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER:<br />
Okay, at first I really liked the character&#039;s background stories. Which were seemingly different from each other. But as soon as the story progresses, you get a feeling &quot;Tch. Another abusive parent&#039;s background story&quot; like that. I was okay with a few people having abusive parents but don&#039;t overdo it. I felt like it was cliche. The originality really came down, I think the only different yet interesting one was Kaori&#039;s backstory. If you don&#039;t know what it is, it&#039;s about an argument between Kaori&#039;s grandmother and her mother fighting for a silly purpose. Which for me, I found realistic and original. My reaction when seeing another abusive parent was &quot;Oh. Didn&#039;t see that coming. Tch.&quot; with a rather annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: - 6/10<br />
STORY - 7/10<br />
ART - 6/10<br />
SOUND - 8/10<br />
CHARACTER - 6/10<br />
ENJOYMENT - 6/10<br />
OVERALL - 6.8/10<br />
<br />
I am quite disappointed, I hope the future episodes fix the situation I&#039;m feeling right now.<br />

    Anime originals are rare; stellar ones even rarer. In today&#039;s anime industry, much like it is in Hollywood, we are bombarded by endless numbers of adaptations of already popular franchises as they help to guarantee a level of financial success. Hoshiai no Sora is a 12 episode  passion project written and directed by Kazuki Akane which was originally produced for 24 episodes before it was then told it could only air 12. This is incredibly clear from the phenomenal production values, and its unique approach to the sports drama genre but also in that the show does not end at episode 12.<br />
<br />
Traditionally in sports

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324928">
        anime, the sport in question is the centrepiece of the characters&#039; lives. Even in Run with the Wind, it is not long before running becomes the most important thing in the character&#039;s lives. Sports anime in general are no different than shounen anime in that they act as fantasy escapism for viewers to vicariously live beautiful, youth-energetic, rose-coloured high school lives with action, adventure, and camaraderie. In many sports anime, we never even see the parents of these children let alone be involved in their children&#039;s lives.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora is unique in that it portrays a group of young middle-schoolers whose life situations are what is being explored and the relationship between these characters in the sport are a consequence of this. This is a mature show that seeks to show what real friendship and camaraderie is and how school and sports can be the refuge from the domestic situations at home. What is most impressive about the show is the dialogue - it is not cheesy, it is not contrived, it is not overly-laden with shounen tropes of eyerolling-inducing cheers of &quot;With the power of friendship, we can literally do anything&quot;, it is an accurate portrayal of how children may react and respond to tough situations and how friends can truly help each other.<br />
<br />
The themes explored in this show are wide and also mature - not seen in most anime in this genre. It would be a spoiler to discuss any of these further but it is worth noting that a sequel is in the works and that this show was made to be 24 episodes long (and indeed they had already produced an ep 13)! Some may find the lack of conclusion to be unsatisfying but personally for me, the pacing of this show was perfect and any attempt to rush a conclusion would be ill-fated.<br />
<br />
The animation is brimming with attention to detail. The way each character is animated shows their own unique quirks and personality traits and right from the beginning, we can see differences in the way characters play soft tennis. Even, the ED oozes more passion and animation than some entire anime. But it is the cinematography and camera work that makes this show stand out. This show does not rely on stills and Powerpoint-esque presentations to show its action. We see action, impact, and reaction and the camera angles are readily used to amply the excitement and dynamism of the action in a way that regular TV cannot. Hoshiai no Sora takes advantage of the anime medium and takes no shortcuts. <br />
<br />
The soundtrack by jizue is one of the best OSTs of 2019 not least because it captures and amplifies the emotions in the scenes, in the way drama and sports OSTs should, but also because the sound is different enough such that it is attributable to Hoshiai no Sora. To design and tailor a soundtrack to as show means the audience should be able to associate it with the specific scenes in this specific show where it is played and jizue nails it.<br />
<br />
When Fall 2019 started airing, I surely did not believe that I would be blessed with another character-driven realistic sports drama so soon after Run with the Wind. However, I was blessed with something greater. An anime original that is brimming with confidence in its approach, its production values, and its willingness to explore adolescence in a genre that is oversaturated with what are nothing more than battle shounen wearing the disguise of a sports jersey. And for that I am grateful, and I truly recommend this to any fans of authentic character dramas, and hope the stars align once more to provide us with the sequel we deserve.<br />

    You have heard of “monster of the week”, now get ready for “bad parent of the week.”<br />
<br />
What was that final episode, anyway? <br />
<br />
Really, what was that? <br />
<br />
Before talking about the anime in general, I just have to say that the final episode is one of the worst things I’ve ever watched. <br />
<br />
Now, let’s begin.<br />
<br />
Drama is something that has been walking side-by-side with the sport’s genre for a long time. It’s the most common element used to drive the characters’ motivations and fuel their development. <br />
Anime such as Ashita no Joe, Touch, Ping Pong the Animation, and many other well-regarded sports anime all fit in this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324847">
        category, and what do they all have in common that Hoshiai doesn’t? The answer is that, at their core, they are still sports anime, and the sport has a reason to be there. It serves a purpose that couldn’t be fulfilled otherwise.   <br />
Hoshiai didn’t needed to be a sports anime. In fact, strip away every instance of sport this show has and replace it with something like a cultural club or something and the results are not very different. <br />
<br />
Edit: news got out that the show was meant to be 25-episode long. While that does answer why many plot points were not resolved, it&#039;s unlikely this will ever get a second season, and even if it does, the points I made here remain the same for these 12 episodes. What is done is done and +13 episodes wouldn&#039;t take back what happened during this &quot;first half.&quot; <br />
<br />
The show has eight main characters. That is alarming enough given it wants to dramatize all of them in just 12 episode, while still holding into the soft tennis aspect, but it seems the show wasn’t satisfied with just that and decided to dramatize the side characters too. <br />
It is as if the only way it knows how to make those characters fit into the story is to put them in some kind of predicament. However, it doesn’t even do that right because it’s more worried about setting up dramas so it can have a moment of tension during the episode, rather than solving those issues in a compelling way. It’s like a mystery show holding its mysteries’ resolution until the final episode, while introducing more and more mysteries as the story goes by for the sole purpose of holding the viewer’s attention, since it doesn’t know of any other way to do that. <br />
I will give credit where credit’s due, though. The characters are well written enough to stand on their own initially; they have unique personalities and unique traits. However, none of that matters when the show only uses them to incite drama. They are like punching bags only waiting for the blow to give the audience some kind of conflict. <br />
<br />
The term “forced drama” has never been more fitting. The show is desperate to make the viewer feel some kind of tension, but setting up soft tennis matches, creating interesting rivals or compelling and well-written conflict is too much work, so it relies on the cheapest tricks in the book to do so. And believe me, it goes beyond the “bad parent of the week” everyone talks about.<br />
<br />
The conflict is generally the same. Almost all the kids have bad parents who do not approve of their behavior and want to dictate how their children should live. The show tries to pass a message about that, but fails miserably when every single drama feels so incredibly forced. <br />
Unlike the main characters, the parents (which in a way are the “villains” of the show) are one-dimensional and stupid characters. Every word of dialogue that comes out of their mouth feels like it were generated by a computer that had a very basic idea of how these characters should be. They are purposely selfish without any given reason and end up being literal plot-devices meant to create drama. And when the show does the same thing for the 5th time (that is, introducing a bad parent), you just kind of don’t care anymore. <br />
The only bad parent that could have been interesting is the main character’s father, which was completely forgotten after a certain event and never mentioned again. However, even he felt like a generic one-dimensional villain that you could find anywhere. He is bad because he has to be, and that’s it. It’s like that with EVERY bad character. This is beyond lazy writing, it’s offensive. <br />
<br />
The drama itself is terribly handled. Some dramas take a whole episode while others take ¼ of one, with absolutely no set-up whatsoever. The characters are hardly affected by it and they only act as if it matters when it’s meant to create more conflict. Said conflict also doesn’t matter because most of the time it’s inconsequential. Episode 9 is probably the worst offender when it comes to this: Nao traps Shingo’s sister in a room for absolute no reason and everyone just laughs it off. It’s not brought up ever again and Nao is fine and dandy in the next episode. <br />
Some dramas are also completely forgotten, like the matter with Yuuta’s mother or the family conflict of the student council president. Some are resolved in a very rushed and cheap way that makes you wonder why they even exist in the first place.<br />
I can’t put into words just how desperate the show is to get some kind of reaction out of the audience. <br />
<br />
And then, at the end of the anime, almost NOTHING that was brought up was resolved.   <br />
The show is also trying to pass a message about social matters, but it fails at that, too. It obviously tries too hard at it, taking me out of the experience. When a character talks about a delicate topic, it feels like they are reading a self-help book about it rather than giving their perspective as a teenager. <br />
<br />
If that was not enough, it can’t even do soft tennis matches well. The opponents are mostly uninteresting. Coincidentally, the only interesting opponent got like that after he stopped being an opponent, showing just how one-dimensional the show is trying to make its villains look like. I feel like it’s doing it on purpose, honestly. The matches are very cheaply written too, following a formula of having the character adapting to the play-style of their opponent, but taking forever to realize obvious things, only dragging the match to pretend there is conflict. <br />
On the technical aspect, the show started beautifully and declined to a depressing state. The animation gets so inconsistent it’s hard to ignore. Character models sometimes look off and there’s an intense reutilization of animation during the tennis matches. Enough to be noticeable. <br />
To put it simply, it gets ugly. It’s a shame when the first episode had such a consistent production and fluid animation. <br />
<br />
There’s a constant overutilization of songs, too. The opening theme is played constantly in key moments, making me desensitized to it when I should be feeling sad or happy. The theme with the piano is also overused during the matches, playing non-stop as if the show only has that one song. It’s not bad, it’s just tiring and lazy. <br />
<br />
You might hear that Hoshiai no Sora “got bad” or “went downhill” after a couple of episodes, but I disagree. I honestly believe the show had problems right off the bat. It’s just that the culmination of drama with little to no resolution became more evident as the series went on. <br />
<br />
Before I end the review, here are a few arguments I have read defending this show:<br />
-In real life, not all problems are resolved, so it’s okay for the show not to solve everything<br />
This is not real life, this is a work of fiction created by humans (although in this case a computer algorithm might as well have created it) and it’s meant to tell a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end. This rule also applies to the subplots. There’s absolutely no reason to bring up a conflict if it’s not getting resolved or doesn’t play a role in the main story, and, as I said before, many things in Hoshiai are almost inconsequential, and even when they are consequential, it’s meant to force the plot to go in a certain direction, making it even more forced.  <br />
-This was never a show about sports, it’s primarily about drama<br />
But it still has a sport. Putting it aside and rushing the games is still lazy. <br />
-The character don’t appear affected by their family drama because they don’t want to show it <br />
That is true to some extent, but it doesn’t excuse ignoring said dramas altogether, while having characters feel bad when it’s convenient. <br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora is a show that has desperate desire to create conflict, alongside one of the cheapest and most dishonest writing I’ve seen, created one of the worst shows I’ve watched this year. It forgets the unnecessary plot points that the show itself had introduced, and rushes others. It tries to send a message, but it feels like it’s lecturing you about it. It fails at everything it attempts. There’s not a single redeeming quality besides the decent production of the first episode. There’s not a single thing to take out of this show, except maybe a good involuntary laugh. <br />
Had it been a comfy slice of life soft tennis anime, maybe the end result would’ve been better.  <br />
Saying I didn&#039;t enjoy it would be an understatement though. This gave me good laughs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and forgive my poor writing and bad English. <br />

    This is it.<br />
<br />
This is the hidden gem of the season.<br />
<br />
I will not write a long review because I want people to discover Hoshiai no Sora by themselves.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora show the good and bad side of life.  The subjects treated in this are profound, serious and can be a real lesson for some of us. Hoshiai no Sora is both a &quot;happy feels&quot; and &quot;sad feels&quot; anime.<br />
<br />
It is rare for me to be attached to the characters, especially in a random anime where I really don&#039;t know the characters. But I really want them to grow and to defeat the demons of their life.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai

          <span style="display: none;" id="review322910">
        no Sora is finally the middle ground I was looking for in an anime, meaning that in the same episode, you will be happy and sad.<br />
<br />
The &quot;big&quot; weakness of this anime is the sport part, which is sad since its an sport anime, but honestly,  you will quickly realize that it is not the most interesting part.<br />
<br />
Also, I really this ending, which displays the characters through dancing, really nice.

    Honestly, before episode 8 I would have given this anime at least a 9/10 for overall, but for some reason EVERY kid in the show has abusive parents. It was fine when it was just a few, but at this point we&#039;re literally just bouncing between parents either abusing their kid or talking about how awful the child is while the other parent (usually a good one) just turns a blind eye and passively agrees with them. <br />
<br />
It was a good show, but for some reason they decided that every character needed a backstory with a broken family where they&#039;re abused by their parents.

    Tired of watching all those isekai or comedy anime? Wanna actually watch an anime that’s close to real life? Then Hoshiai no Sora is that anime for you! But please let me tell you this. Don’t view it as an anime. Don’t just look at it as a fictional story. This isn’t for people who only watch anime to “escape” from real life. Watch it as if it’s actually happening in front of you, as if it’s happening in reality, as if the characters are people you know, as if you’re a third party observing what they are going through. If you can do that,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324878">
        then watching this will be very worth it. <br />
<br />
Before I begin, I’d like to point out that this review will focus on what happened in the anime rather than how it happened. What I mean is that I won’t focus on things like character development or story pacing or stuff like that, since I’m not good with those aspects of stories. I’ll be talking about what they said and what they went through. This also may contain some spoilers.<br />
<br />
When I first saw a PV for this show, I thought that maybe this would be like other sports anime. Almost all the sports anime I’ve seen has had drama in its run, and Hoshiai no Sora is no exception. But when I watched it; boy, was I wrong. What makes this anime different from other sports anime is that the drama is a more realistic reflection of the problems that happen in real life, and the sport the characters play isn’t the main focus of the anime, rather, it is a catalyst for the characters to help one another with their problems as they go through life. The first episode already had something major happen, which made me instantly love the anime (Don’t get me wrong, though. I hated what happened.). <br />
<br />
Basically, the anime is about a soft tennis club on the verge of disbanding, until a new member shows up and helps make the club better than it was before. But don’t let the cute and clean art style fool you, as there are deep themes involved in the characters’ lives, and the characters try to go through them with the help of one another while at the same time trying to win a competition to save their club. The different problems that each character has are what make the show realistic.<br />
<br />
One of the major themes that is seen in the anime are family problems. Almost everyone in the team has a problem with their parents, and there’s a whole episode that focuses on families. First, we have Maki, and from the very first episode, we can see that he has a major problem with his father, who was very abusive since he was born. Then we have Nao, who has what we can call a “helicopter parent,” as we can see that she doesn’t support what he likes and makes decisions for him thinking that it is for his own good. Basically, almost all of them have family problems, and the tennis club is there to bring them together for each other’s support.<br />
<br />
Another theme the show tackled, which was something I liked, was sexuality and gender identity. In the second episode, one of the characters, Yuuta (a guy), was discovered by Maki to have liked another guy. This scene made me like the show even more, as this gives us some LGBT+ representation in anime where the supporting character isn’t judged or made a big deal out of, or used as a major plot point. In another episode, due to some circumstances, Yuuta and Maki end up talking about gender identity, and it is revealed that someone Maki knows is actually transgender, which gives us good trans representation in anime. This scene is probably one of my favorites in the series, as Yuuta mentions that he doesn’t know what he identifies as, and Maki says he doesn’t have to rush. It’s okay to take time to figure yourself out. What matters the most is being able to discover who you are and what you want to be, and it doesn’t matter how long it takes to do so. This really hit close to home, as I am also part of the LGBT+.<br />
<br />
Some of the characters of the show that I think are worth mentioning are Maki, Yuuta, and Mitsue. I have already talked Yuuta before, so I will be talking about Maki. He’s a 14 year-old middle school student who just moved back to his hometown and started studying in the school where the story takes place. We see that he is very active, he uses the stairs instead of the elevator, and he also does basically all of the chores. We then also notice that he has insane reflexes, and Toma (his classmate) also notices this and asks him to join the tennis club. After certain conditions, he accepts and that moves the story forward. What I like about Maki is that he’s one of the mature ones in the group. Because of what happened in his youth, he’s able to see the important things in life, and he’s able to talk about it with his friends. I think it’s even better given how young he is, because a lot of us when we were his age didn’t really care much about doing good things or not, we just did what we wanted to do. Maki does things his way, but with a goal in mind. Him being there helps improve the tennis club, and in a way, slowly helps relieving his friends’ emotions from all of their problems.<br />
<br />
Next, I’ll be talking about Mitsue’s character. When we first see her, the first thing we might think is that she’s a cynical jerk. I thought that way as well. But as the time passed by, I realized why she became that way. Her parents are unsupportive of her dream, and people online diss her for it, so who wouldn’t be cynical? While some of her actions aren’t good, they are understandable. The reason she was a jerk to the tennis club was because they were enjoying what they liked when the people around them don’t support them, when she was also going through the same thing. While she was a jerk, she still supported them, as she still went to some of their activities even if she said that she didn’t want to. And by the end of the anime, we can see that she really is to start rooting for them; she is more supportive to them and actually starts drawing soft tennis drawings, and she starts to ignore all the hateful comments thrown at her from art, which I think is a good development for her.<br />
<br />
Another thing I liked about the show was how they implemented some things that a lot of people worry about, but for others it doesn’t seem like a big deal. An example is when the club was in one of their activities and everyone was talking to each other and having fun except for Toma. Yuuta noticed this and asked Toma about it, and Toma replied that he isn’t good at slipping into groups and having fun. I also felt this, since I’m not that much of a social person as well.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, even if there were tons of drama, it’s still a sports anime, and the sports did not disappoint. Even if the sports weren’t the focus of the anime, the show was properly able to explain the techniques and rules soft tennis has. The animations of the sports scenes were fluid, and it was really exciting to watch. The closest I have with playing soft tennis is badminton (the players have to use rackets), but I think I can say that everything here related to the sport is pretty spot-on. The sports peaked at the final episodes, and they were amazing as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think that was an amazing anime, especially with it being an original. They were able to talk and discuss about different problems that people go through in real life, and they were also able to execute the drama with the sports perfectly. I’ve noticed that people think it’s weird that they just placed some drama here and there without any build-up. But that’s how one would see it if they just viewed it as an anime. If one were to view it as a reflection of real life, however, not just a normal show, they’d be able to better understand why. You don’t just know someone in real life then they’ll slowly gives hints about their problems and then BOOM, that’s when you feel some emotion for them. In real life, you wouldn’t be able to know who has what kind of problems, and people you know that don’t seem to have any problems with their lives might end up being hurt because of them. You shouldn’t expect some build-up before that happens. But I guess that’s my opinion, since other people care a lot more about that aspect of the show<br />
<br />
I guess since I viewed it like real life rather than just the regular anime (probably one of the rare times I’ve done this), I thought it was amazing and pretty realistic. I was even able to learn about new topics that I didn’t know of before, like postpartum depression, and also some soft tennis techniques (not that I’ll ever use them though, I&#039;m not that sporty). Although it ended with a major cliffhanger, with everything that happened here, I can say that this anime has rightfully made it to my favorite Sports and Drama anime, and if there’s a 2nd season, I’d definitely watch it. But this anime probably isn’t for those who watch sports anime just for the sports or cares too much about how much drama there is in an anime. <br />

    The promotional poster of Hoshiai no Sora (Stars Align) caught my eye even before the show began airing.<br />
<br />
“Even in an ever-changing world, only the starlit sky will not change”. <br />
<br />
As a coming of age story, Hoshiai Sora teaches an important lesson about how we humans change, how we evolve, and how we grow up in an ever changing life. We live in a society dubbed as a modern era of controversy, where we communicate through our feelings but often causing trouble unknowingly. It’s part of growing up. Everyone makes mistakes in some way or another. It’s what makes us human. In this original anime, you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324834">
        can say that making mistakes is part of the common norm, a very common fact that needs to be accepted.<br />
<br />
We all have to start off somewhere. Rome wasn’t built in a day after all and for someone like Maki Katsuragi, he enters the show as a transfer student and tennis beginner. Transferring to a school presents challenge on its own as he is the new kid in the neighborhood. Shijou Minami is a school where there’s a population of complex teenagers, driven by social anxiety while trying to forge a future for themselves. Maki faces a similar situation as he tries to build a future for himself in a seemingly stressful life. After reuniting with his childhood friend Touma Shinjou, he joins his school’s soft tennis club. This is where his daily adventure begins. But before we look into his school life, one shouldn’t forget about how he lives at home. <br />
<br />
Hoshiai no Sora may be a coming of age story but it adamantly adds a bold amount of drama. The first few episodes tells a harsh reality as we see the behavior of abusive parents. It’s actually a common norm in this show, so much that you’d think adults in their world are socially incapable of building a lasting relationship with their children. Watching this show tells how harsh reality can really be, especially for those who suffered physical or mental abuse. It’s a sensible subject that makes Hoshiai no Sora feel so real. But back to Maki’s situation, he faces abuse from his own father. An early example includes his father taking his savings while inflicting abuse on him. Maki’s fear is evident as he doesn’t report his situation to authorities but actually resorts to lies. By showing such a reality, we can definitely feel sympathetic. No one should have to come home and fear their own father. Abuse also extends to other characters such as Itsuki Ameno. The physical burn scar is a symbol of abuse by his own mother when he was an infant. Life is really tough when reality hits such way, isn’t it?<br />
<br />
Luckily, characters in the show are able to get back up when life knocks them down. The soft tennis club serves as a way for them to escape reality and build their character. Maki and Touma grows as part of their daily life activities and begins to show more signs of confidence. United by their common goal to win, the soft tennis club serves also serves a social hub for our characters. Daily issues may be common but they strive to resolve them together. At first, trouble seems difficult but as time goes on, the club becomes a unity of trust, commitment, and value. It’s so important to see how characters connects with each other in order to accomplish goals. As the captain, Toma leads the team with his commanding presence and takes soft tennis seriously, more than anyone else. It’s a difficult task for him as many of the other members slacks off that puts the club into tight budget. But on their way of success, the members begins to show more commitment. Watching this group grow will feel stressful at first because of how imperfect they are. But the more I watched the club, the more I realize how relatable these characters are. Hoshiai no Sora has characters fall into life stressful quagmires, but the soft tennis club serves as a beacon of light.<br />
<br />
And thanks to the soft tennis club, you can bet that characters begins to grow out of their shells. Maki is the most evident example as he finds the courage to stand up against his abusive father when Touma is threatened by him. It’s a powerful example of a boy who is able to overcome his personal demons to protect what he treasures, the important relationship he has built with his friend. Touma’s own problem at home traces its roots to his mother, a person who seems emotionally abusive towards his son. It’s like a stomping on his confidence until he begins to prove himself as a capable captain of the tennis club. However, not everyone suffers from parental abuse. Rintarou Futsu is a rare case of having loving parents despite being adopted. In sharp contrast compared to the main characters, he lives a happy life with them. And because of this, Rintarou is fundamentally a nice person and serves as someone who others can easily trust in. When you see the anime showcase characters this way, it’s also easy to tell how parents can have influence on their kids.<br />
<br />
By the time you’ve watched a decent portion of the show, it’s easy to see the amount of sensible subjects. The anime explores issues dealing with adult fear, parental abuse, and even sexual orientation. Yu, the manager of the club, is the most prominent example. Because he is homosexual, Yu attracts bullies and abuse, even from his own mother. It’s situations in the show that can be hard to watch if you find his circumstances relatable. And as I’ve said before, this anime isn’t shy about being controversial. <br />
<br />
But despite all this drama, we do have light comedy that has shifts its mood tone. A few examples includes Maki’s brutal honesty who sometimes says things that can be unintentionally ludicrious. There are also running gags about how certain characters looks feminine, so much that there’s even an episode with crossdressing. On the tennis field, competition may be tense but some of the strategies employed by the club are laughable. When you add more of the cherry character personalities of other club members, it can be quite a lighthearted anime. And the more you watch Hoshiai no Sora, the more you’ll realize that the show isn’t truly about sports competition. It’s about characters growing up.<br />
<br />
Director Kazuki Akane’s early work has little to no similarities with this anime so it’s rather refreshing to see him take on this project with his tone of storytelling. The character designs takes on a soft touch with simple art style. Most noticeably however, it’s the character expressions that stands out the most. Between the main characters and various abusive parents, it show how real the anime can really get. Watching the characters&#039; speech mannerism is important as it allows us to judge on their character personalities. Finally, I do want to mention that this show has one of the most catchiest and stylish ED theme song of the year. The dance movements and choreography is exceptionally eye catchy despite some characters out of synch. It’s hard not to dance with them.<br />
<br />
At a pace of 12 episodes, this show dealt with drama on a level that I wasn’t prepared for. I came to watch this show for soft tennis but got treated with doses of drama in an emotional coming age of life. But that’s what makes this anime stand out so much. The daily adventures of the soft tennis club reminds us the reality of life, where we all have to face problems at one way or another.

    Repetition ruins a lot of things. It can ruin a job, a movie or even an anime considering the rate at which the repetition happens. Sadly, in this anime, the repetitive drama was one of the worst things I saw in an anime. <br />
<br />
When it comes to sports anime, I tend to judge it based on 2 main ideas: The sport&#039;s part and the human interaction/plot part. So I&#039;ll do that here. <br />
<br />
First one is the sport&#039;s part, it gets a 3/10. As a tennis fan watching these games, I felt a lot of cringe. The rules are kinda the same but the excution is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324838">
        bad. I can understand for example a player trying to touch the ball before it falls to the ground the first time but no one ever just jumps at the first ball like it&#039;s a bomb that would explode if it touched the ground. I could understand that the characters didn&#039;t care about the sport but they were in the club for a lot of time to not know the very very basic stuff. <br />
Also, using the same animation over and over again to make it seem like there was a big rally going and how the rallys were actually happening in the anime were so stupid. <br />
<br />
The idea of making every match end 4 3 or 4 2 to make it seem like it was close was also annoying. Why not let an underdog win if you want to make it exciting? <br />
I&#039;m really generous giving the sport&#039;s part a 3/10 tbh. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now to the 2nd part which is the characters. 3/10. <br />
&quot;My parent/s hates me so I&#039;m sad&quot;. This is legit 100% the drama. Not a single character has good parents iirc. Having a character who lives a shitty life because of a bad parent or 2 is ok but when this is almost every character in the anime then something is wrong here. This is just playing on the fan&#039;s feelings and sympathy in the dumbest way possible. <br />
<br />
There is the MC who is so wise, accepting and has the answer to every problem you face. The annoying female girl that is too edgy for the world yet is sometimes made as the victim despite starting a fight for no reason. The LGBT guy that has to be there for the anime to be inclusive even thought he helped like once in the entire anime. There are lots and lots more of bad characters filling the show up from the start to the end. This was just bad to watch simply because of the characters&#039; interactions which were just bad. <br />
<br />
There were legit 2 characters I liked to see that had reasonable drama, the red haired guy and his sister. I think those were the most acceptable ones tbh. <br />
<br />
Overall I would give the anime a 3/10. Really disappointing for an anime that had a very good start to it yet failed so hard. Considering how the anime went, it may get a second season but idk how it is going to actually be better than this one or even give a saving grace to this.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn&#039;t recommend it.

EVERY SHIT TIME<br />
<br />
There are two ways to build stories within a sport, or they are stories about the sport, serving as an introduction and basis of study, bringing a plot that interconnects them and establishes characters, called &#039;&#039; sports &#039;&#039;, or they treat sport as something secondary they focus on building the characters, causing atmosphere and exploring any kind of conflict, we can usually call it &#039;&#039; escape sports &#039;&#039; if it&#039;s not quite clear, I&#039;ll give you examples: Hajime no ippo is a sports anime, while Ashita no joe is a sports anime escape, Slam dunk is a sports manga, Real is a sports

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325885">
        escape, well ... You got the idea, and it&#039;s up to them all to fulfill their duties, in Hoshiai no sora, nothing is fulfilled.<br />
<br />
We are embarking on a journey with dramas, which is a subject that should be a fair approach to the theme, starting with introductions, building and finally ending, even a drama without ending it can still be considered fair enough, because it had its introduction and its exploration, is a way of balancing delicate subjects that in fiction, an introduction drama and an ending can be unsatisfactory for some, but it has a way of balancing, but take all the things I&#039;ve introduced so far, throw them in the pan and wait for the damn script to be done, because that&#039;s what this anime does.<br />
<br />
Hoshiai no sora is a story of forced drama and completely irresponsible for what it introduces, it begins as a stage preparation to then present its characters and its damn drama, I defend to some extent as a first episode that has the right to be impactful and show what will be dealt with, but the rest after that is the same sensation of throwing a bucket of cold water every 5 minutes, because this anime has no consistency what it wants to address, just pushes scenes that only serve as cheap shock value in every episode, and sustains it as a way of feeding the viewer, God ... That&#039;s no way to make a drama. Dramas are meant to be impactful to the characters and the viewer, and they need considerable screen time for the viewer to absorb the situation, think about it and conclude their perspective, but before episode 2, without any hesitation we are already introduced to a conflict in the first seconds, completely forced and without any context of the character and situation, there is no usual construction of the character for us we care enough about him, the director delivers and says you need empathy, otherwise the anime introduced stupid dramas like Mitsue&#039;s being bullied (wow ... Two bully in the same episode just to recreate a scenario of both characters alone ... Not a little forced, is it?).<br />
<br />
I wish this was the last complaint if the crap in the next episode didn&#039;t introduce me A THIRD BULLY, which only served to irritate the soft tennis todoroki and show how sad its past is, and all done with 0 harmony, just inserting at the last second, and after yet another episode shock value we are presented with a horrible development, living proof of how victimistic this anime is in a supposed &quot;fight&quot; situation that should result in both sides, it completely ignores Itsuki&#039;s side, just to emphasize a hasty development of the person he is ... Completely ignoring any act of consequence that should have here. The next episode of continuity in the training plot and characters, introducing some and ending an episode with the same cliffhanger crap, can&#039;t this anime make an episode solid? It seems that everything needs to end in horrible things or injustices, which most of the time are not explored, and this is used over and over again in several episodes in a row, usually cliffhangers being the outcome of several episodes would be understandable if this series were mystery or some police plot, but it is not, she uses a script trick several times and this is all lazy and predictable.<br />
<br />
Not even the soft tennis aspect is addressed here, this story doesn&#039;t decide whether to be a sports anime or escape sports, introduces basic things about soft tennis and then focuses on dramatic episodes or screen times that contain it, it&#039;s an inconsistency that disrespects any objective means directed at a sports media product, it develops nothing, much less its message, primarily to whom is that message? What kind of dad will watch this anime and change its behavior? None because they don&#039;t have to stay up late watching a flawed soft tennis drama looking for a job.<br />
<br />
The protagonist of this anime is just Gary stu&#039;s tenth definition of the sports we&#039;re already used to, we might call him soft tennis Superman, it&#039;s stupid to see that he always has an answer to everything, making a character collision inconsistent Often, as always, it saves the team from decay, any sort of problem it solves, and its narrative function is that, while Toma is meant to be another child suffering from an incomplete drama. All the characters here are artificial and have an introduction of dramas and lousy characters, you are nothing at all here, there is no harmony, they introduce me to a fucking pair of soft tennis twins that we later found out to be the typical shounen opponents, and of course all of them are a blockade for the protagonists being tall, all the characters sink deeper into the narrative, it seems the script begs you to always care about them, I can&#039;t see any passion between the creator for his own project here, he just throws a lot of random problems at his characters and does nothing to make it happen, and when he has an outcome they are forced, only to watch Nao genuinely happy after ignoring his mother, dealt with in a way. simplistic way that the whole drama journey was useless and unconvincing. useless presentation of secondary characters who take too much screen time, all that class president building is minimally unnecessary and useless, I don&#039;t care about this character, so why should I see more of her without her having about 5/5 time in 5 episodes? We could explore some drama here ... But no, let&#039;s work on this girl that we can only sum up in aristocrat.<br />
<br />
This anime&#039;s matches are disgusting to watch, man this is one of the worst camera jobs I&#039;ve ever seen, not only that as lighting, it seems like I&#039;m in the same fucking day when I see a match and the camera in return for it makes you want to throw up every time they get the ball, Hanebado could be bad but the camera movement was good, here it looks like a guy stuck the camera to a soft tennis ball and decided that they should act that way. But returning to the expected drama in one episode we have a consequence being completely ignored from the previous episode, a drama being inserted, AGAIN BY ABUSIVE PARENTS, this shit is getting me tired, it seems like every week they want to introduce me to a new one and all of them being artificial, and what does anime do to exploit it or solve it? Nothing, the director is unaware of the word &quot;family dialogue&quot; that if possible could already progress the plot in such a way that you could observe an overview of the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still about the episode he introduces me to a conflict between Mitsue, a characterization of Touma&#039;s friend, a characterization of Mitsue herself and ends the episode making a cliffhanger... I don&#039;t know how anyone looks at this script and says that he is solid, so many things being introduced and pacing does not contribute to any of this, this anime does not need so much stupid drama, I think even the worst romance this year did not have such a ridiculous pacing like this.<br />
<br />
I want to make room for this paragraph to talk about how bad episode 9 of this anime is, introduced Shingo&#039;s sister who conveniently gets lost because the characters are dumb and instead of making Mitsue follow the girl, they give the excuse for most useless character having to do the work and bear the consequence, if Mitsue feared the child would go to the roof, why the hell did she run to warn everyone? Consistency of character, you know, and with the unfolding Nao that was totally shaken by his mother ends up finding Shingo&#039;s sister, and here this anime managed to introduce one of the most forced and ridiculous scenes of the year, out of nowhere Nao begins to see the Shingo&#039;s sister as a problem blocking everything and lock the room ... Lazy and completely idiot, what kind of reaction is that? If it were to become a shaken character why at the announcement of the game he was not before? Shingo&#039;s sister was still sleeping right in the ward ... Lazy again, with the end of this part, Maki with his superhero ability realizes that Nao was to blame and saves Shingo&#039;s sister, Nao begins to blame himself and cry, while everyone around you is laughing ... What kind of reaction is that? No one noticed his suffering? Character reaction and consequence ... Then we have a super robotic dialogue between the protagonists about Nao&#039;s parents and parents themselves, over time the episode introduces us to Tsubasa who also has an abusive father ... Creativity, and in that same Tsubasa and his father quarrel, Tsubasa hurts his wrist and just runs away from home ... Which already makes it a lazy narrative convenience just to give DRAMA, and right now Shingo is leaving home to train, he sees Tsubasa, Tsubasa try to run away and Shingo decides to HOLD HIM ON HIS FUCKING HIS FUCKING BITCH that sucked at the forced convenience of the club, this is an involuntary comedy show every epic episode, tell me what Shingo&#039;s sister&#039;s conflict was for other than giving more details of Nao&#039;s family? For practically shit, it was so pointless that even the consequence of Nao being a liar was made.<br />
<br />
Why does this anime, instead of further antagonizing family figures, not show a second perspective or a really sad and shaken parent? In 11 episodes, not even the most important aspect between problem perspectives worked, and when it comes to everyday problems it&#039;s always good to see a more humane side of the situation, even if we don&#039;t agree with the actions, at least one perspective is there to support it. every basis and idea of ​​discussing a daily problem as a theme, but this anime once again does none of it, just tries to push like every adult (except the teacher) here is a bad person with characteristics of a psychopath. To give you an idea of ​​what I&#039;m saying, the familiar and minor problems this anime has introduced but haven&#039;t solved so far, and we&#039;re nearing the final episode:<br />
<br />
Maki&#039;s Dad (unresolved)<br />
-Touma&#039;s mother (unresolved)<br />
-Mitsue and something about drawings (solved?)<br />
-Rentarou (unresolved)<br />
-No and his mom / dad (unresolved)<br />
-Don&#039;t be a pathological liar (unresolved)<br />
-Tsubasa and the abusive father (unresolved)<br />
-Shingo and his non-biological mother (unresolved)<br />
-The chubby girl and her family (unresolved)<br />
-The very concept of soft tennis (unresolved)<br />
-Yuu regarding your mother (unresolved)<br />
-Touma and that mini jealousy inserted by Maki have enough prominence (was made in the previous ep and unresolved)<br />
<br />
Even if you tell me it can be completed in a second season, then why put a cliffhanger on an end of episode if the anime doesn&#039;t resolve to give at least 1/5 of Yuu&#039;s situation? Even if he has a season 2, then why insert 1000 dramas and not split them by season? Because it would be a more advisable and much fairer construction of script, it can complete several in a second season, but it has set a loaded plot in a bad way.<br />
<br />
About the final episode:<br />
<br />
This final stretch was disgusting, for skies that lousy production, they recycled the same shit about 10 times in the final match, it hurt my eyes because I felt in a loop that didn&#039;t go anywhere, there&#039;s no strategy in this anime, everything just depends on last minute momentum, please if you watch this for production value take any screenshot of the last episode and notice the whole background changing places at every point, character twisting in static images, errors of exchange of faces in the characters, seriously it&#039;s horrible how much even our main characters suffered from it, I&#039;ve never seen a storyboard get so messed up, you don&#039;t feel any harmony with the soft tennis match, the episode still tries to generate a repulsive drama from twins, but what impact on narrative do they have to have this conflict? Why should I care? The anime fails completely in character humanization, and so much so that this is forcibly inserted, we have 15 seconds just focused on those twins that make no difference, and the end of this anime is completely giant shit, didn&#039;t complete any plot that was established, introduced drama over Touma without any conclusion, Why the hell did Toma&#039;s mom start laughing like a shounen villain on the phone? I&#039;ve always said that the parents of this anime are portrayed as villains of Sword Art Online, but damn it makes it even funnier, and then turned Maki into a character from School Days, that final sequence was hilarious and so ridiculous, completely thrown and forced, I don&#039;t know how anyone looks at this script and pronounces the word &quot;solid&quot;. because it is not, everything here is forced and artificial, even if you planned this series for 24 episodes, you don&#039;t treat your characters like trash and make a despicable ending, there are good kinds of &quot;bad ending&quot; in fiction, some of it built in a way, that has a strong base and that indicates it, making it unique, but here there is none of it, as I said, this series is a story that only if It focuses on pure shock value rather than continuing the narrative.<br />
<br />
About the production<br />
<br />
The direction of this anime is poor, frankly it doesn&#039;t have a shred of identity being shaped throughout the episodes, at least different camera angles that aren&#039;t merit either and a particularly very lively scene, but you have scenes like 3 FUCKING MINUTES OF FLASHBACKS OF TIME, and we&#039;ve watched them all and know how it got there, all unnecessarily to take up screen time in a futile way. This anime has one of the ugliest arts I&#039;ve ever seen, take any frame episode 8 and especially episode 11 that clearly should have been neat, compare all the scenes, not only in art but the animation of this anime is poor, at first they were good sakugas but it all boiled down to recycled scenes, recycled angles, the same recycled models... And all of this making the characters off model, I can make a folder in Imgur of how many times the anime has had it, it&#039;s no pleasure watching this type and the soundtrack here is nonexistent, there is only one piano track and one insert song THAT IS THE SAME SHIT OF OPENING MUSIC, for every moment the anime tries to introduce it I feel like throwing up, even moments that do not live up to the situation, are received by this song.<br />
<br />
this story feel me sick and has many inconsistencies and plot problems, dramas inserted in an indecisive way, the director does not know how to work on any theme that has been put in, let alone his characters, purely &quot;bad&quot; parents who repeat themselves in the script, would be important put a fresh perspective on them and show that some are even human for their child&#039;s concern, but the director chooses to make them villains of Sword Art Online, it&#039;s not an educational dialogue about a representative community that will make this anime something well, this story is completely dishonest with the viewer, the same applies when we are 3 episodes without a trace of Yuu and his mother&#039;s problems... They don&#039;t even work out the consequence, this anime can even disrespect the viewer himself, Jesus... He owes several explanations and solves nothing.

    Ongoing viewing, 9 episodes in so far... Taking a break for writting this. Editing later prolly, but keeping that for now.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a total of 12 episodes, i understand the idea of &quot;putting a story and stuff to fill the narrative and giving substance to the story and characters&quot;, but why i have the feeling of everything is WAY TOO EASY, flat, bland, tasteless. <br />
Plot device, event, whatever..<br />
Everything is dropped without setup, just for the sake of &quot;having a situation&quot; and used as plot device. It&#039;s just there and nobody seems to care or react to it, accepting everything right off the bat &quot;Ok!&quot;, &quot;Yes!&quot;. Quite

          <span style="display: none;" id="review323543">
        unrealistic.  <br />
<br />
The MC is a &quot;god&quot; into the story, making everything, planning everything, knowing everything, better at everything.. such a hero, yaay!  <br />
<br />
Every character seems to have their struggle/backstory.<br />
Yet, again, why pushing so much of the &quot;kid/parents&quot; issue... At that point, it&#039;s 5 differents parent/kid drama (and prolly 6), just.. Wtf.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t perceive any form of &quot;life&quot; out of any of these characters. Their behavior seems pretty unatural and i just can&#039;t get into the story. I can&#039;t relate to any of them or make any connexion as it is right now.<br />
<br />
The delivery is not here, and mixing everything don&#039;t give any form of unity to the story.

Hoshiai no Sora is by and large a drama anime that has the sport of soft tennis mixed in to act as a catalyst for bringing together the main characters and showing growth. For those who are looking for a shonen sports anime with your typical summer camps and special moves and growing the team and lots of matches against strong teams and rising to the top, this isn&#039;t really a show for you.<br />
<br />
The story itself is something that captivated me from the get-go. It was something different, and something very captivating as slice of life animes are typically very appealing to me. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324893">
        characters are all very unique and have their own dramas going on with their lives, each of them having very upbringings and lots of problems going on in their respective houses, hence drama. The way the characters have grown from the beginning of the show through the main character, Maki, has been very enjoyable to watch. The way it explored psychological aspects of school students and the understanding it takes to see why the kids act the way they do blew me away. Unfortunately due to issues with the production studio, this anime currently remains half finished, as what was initially supposed to be a 24 episode anime got cut in half, and the director decided instead of rushing to finish, they would play out their story and finish whatever they could by their story.<br />
<br />
The music and artwork in the anime is very good in my opinion. I loved their choices for opening and ending songs, and the art really captured what was happening in each scene, with each scene exhibiting very normal stuff and drawn so well that you could easily absorb yourself in their world.<br />
<br />
Overall, enjoyment of this anime was very high. As I said at the beginning, this is a drama anime with sports mixed in, not the other way around. Many people might be left disappointed by the fact sports is its hook, but not me. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and would recommend it easily for someone looking for a school drama anime. The way it is able to capture the drama in the families of kids in school is quite incredible and still progress forward, juxtaposing fun moments with sad and tense moments, is quite incredible. A very well written story that I pray will get a season 2 to finish off.

    If there’s two people I know who don’t need to be told or shown more than they already have seen for themselves how rotten parentage can be, its me and my poor older sister who got the worst of it. Parentage, and especially motherhood, is often portrayed as a thing of love, and care, and protection, all of which are qualities understood to be innate, healthy, and of course, natural. This is not the case. Well, most of the time it is, because, as they say, stereotypes come from somewhere, but nevertheless, such is not the always the case. Sometimes parentage can be malicious, dangerous,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review324831">
        and scary, and it can ruin people’s lives before they’ve even begun. Hoshiai no Sora, despite its outward appearance as a benign sports anime, is a show about the deep seated psychological atrophies and torsions which cause the innocent love of parents to go sour, and more importantly, it is also the first show I’ve seen with this subject matter which manages to portray such a delicate issue in a way which isn’t so misguided as to be offensive, so if not for the hours of soft tennis it unapologetically wasted my time and its own time with, I sincerely thank this show for being able to depict something none other in its genre has been able to correctly, nor this cathartically.<br />
<br />
Our hero Maki Katsuragi is a no-bullshit little nihilist who joins his school’s soft-tennis club—a notoriously negligent and satirically self-aware club—not for precious middle school memories, but for cold hard cash. Like a badass. But in actuality, Maki is only requesting to join the team under these conditions as a front. Knowing his Gary Stu, god-like, anime self-insert protagonist abilities in soft-tennis are indispensable to the dramatically hopeless team and doubly knowing the desperate team captain, Touma Shinjou, will do anything to get his hands on such a valuable player to revive his long-dead team, he exploits the situation to get the income under the guise he doesn’t care and will only participate for money, when in reality, the poor kid is really just desperate himself to secure any money he can to help his single working mother make ends meet. It’s a pretty real setup, but it gets really real when you learn the principle reason his mother’s own salary is insufficient is Maki’s father, his mother’s abusive ex-husband, is making routine visits to their apartment when only Maki is home to steal whatever of their money he can, because despite his dastardly attitude, Maki’s history of being beaten by this guy for as long as he can remember has him totally shut down whenever he’s present.<br />
<br />
Seeing Maki so pitiable is a poignantly stark contrast to the snarky bastard he is at school, and it so perfectly illustrates just how fundamentally abuse can permanently eat its way into its victims psyches, especially when they are young and dangerously impressionable. Seeing Maki, the nonsensically overpowered isekai protagonist who one day found himself in a show about soft-tennis, crumble like a house of cards at the mere sight of this scumbag really sells the implications of what he’s done to him to the viewers, and more importantly, what people in real life actually have to go through. However, what makes it truly well written and worthy of praise is how much it does NOT do what every other psychological horror-comedy anime does and actually portrays this terribly serious relationship as one made up of reality. The scenes are only after a lull in the action; should you catch on, there’s this absolutely chilling break in dialogue; the color palette layers itself with this oh-so-subtle drab overtone you don’t even notice until it’s too late; and right as it happens the camera shudders—and, oh—the cinematography! The cinematography is brilliant! The sudden shaking slams on the breaks, and the camera grinds its movements to a halt as if it’s just as horrified as the poor child cowering in the corner, cutting only to show flash-cuts infused so ingeniously with panic or perspective shots so ruthlessly ratcheting up the already towering levels of immersion present in these glorious scenes by literally putting us in his shoes. And you see him hit ‘em, and kick ‘em, and berate ‘em, and tear the apartment apart to steal what little they have to take, and he’s crying, and trembling, and cowering and—uuuuhh—it’s just the BEST!<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, it’s the manner in which the damage is so correctly ingrained into Maki’s personality in a way with speaks to real life—much unlike most shows incorporating the likes of abusive parents who’re merely out to pander to the edge-fandom as painstakingly bluntly as they can—is what makes it so affecting, convincing, and tactful. That said, Maki is by no means alone. The team captain I mentioned, Touma, lives in a household wherein his father avoids his mother out of reticence, and his mother avoids him out fear all the while unfairly pampering his other brother. Their transgendered team manager, Yuuta—on top of being relentlessly bullied at school for being outwardly gay—lives in a household wherein he has to work with his sister to hide his crossdressing from his mother, whom is of the belief once she dramatically discovers his habit that he’s a freak and she’s a failure as a mother by way of his development. Their team member, Itsuki, was born to a Mother who poured boiling water on him as a crying baby, leaving him with a horrific scar spanning his entire backside and a dangerously volatile trigger for violence. Their other team member, Nao, lives in a household under strict control by a world-class helicopter parent whose crushed him under so much stress he’s become a pathological liar. Getting ridiculous yet? Because I could go on, wether it be the adopted Rintaro or the destructively spoiled Taiyou, apparently any character they bothered naming in this show has some degree of unhealthy parentage under their belts, and in retrospect, only so many of these cases actually got it right—and that’s only if you can buy into the fact such an abundance of said cases could even occur under such a massively coincidental set of circumstances in the first place.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Hoshiai no Sora is, as a whole, what I would call bluffing. I devoted a paragraph to praising the directorial deftness on display in scenes depicting Maki’s abuse, because not everyone gets that degree of harsh and intricate realism and is thereby nowhere near as believable or smartly written from a critical standpoint. I can’t really speak to Yuuta’s portrayal, because while I suffer from as much body dysmorphia as any other clinically depressed autist, I’ve never actually had gender identity issues. But I’ve been screamed at, slapped at, struck at, and everything in between which these poor kids have to no end, and frankly, I don’t think they’re developed in a way someone with my experience can really believe in in good faith. Itsuki is violent, because he was abused. Okay, my sister turned violent too, and she fell out of relationship after relationship because her and her men always seemed to be in a rush to hit one another. But despite getting the same treatment she did, I didn’t turn violent, and no matter how many years those bitches throughout school would gang up on me, I never once even thought to strike back. Clearly, it takes more to go violent then to simply have been hurt by your guardians in the past. Nao is a pathological liar, because he was put under pressure. Okay, I devolve into a pathological liar whenever a conversational partner decides to pry into my personal life, and I often even suffer from cognitive dissonance having built year long personas with different colleagues and family members all based on lies which don’t align as they were fabricated in the moment on nothing but panic. But despite getting the same treatment I did, my sister didn’t go crazy, and no matter the fact she went to a private school which placed its own extra dosage of pressure onto her separate from my mother’s already bountiful amount, she never once broke down. Clearly, it also takes a lot more to go crazy then to simply have been pressured by your guardians in the past. Do you see what I’m getting at with these examples? What surface level developments the show offers are not the only ingredients to these special solutions, and the fact the show portrays it as if it is shows a certain level of ignorance in its writing and conceptualization—even if the show is obviously coming from a place of genuine artfulness and good intentions. There is so much more nuance to these phenomena of developmental psychology then is shown or discussed by the show I cannot wholeheartedly buy into the idea—despite its wealth of dramatization—any one of these kids, no matter how seemingly unfortunate, are ever going to end up like my sister, who went through rehab before she was able to graduate college and was knocked up by a drunkard who would become so unhinged she and her newborn son had to flee back to my parents house for safety, or end up like me, whose thrown myself into traffic, thrown myself off an overpass, overdosed on antidepressants and sleeping pills, and cut myself so violently and for so long the skin color of my left forearm is now different from that of my right. I’m not trying to justify my opinion by exploiting the fact my real life sob story is worse than the ones Akane Kazuki came up with, because he very well could’ve come up with ones a lot worse—its fiction, after all. I’m just trying to make the point the subtle ways in which these children are affected by their parents’ scarring behavior may or may not be as accurate as they needed to be in all cases, seeing as I actually have had the misfortune of knowing how at least two people really did turn out in the real world.<br />
<br />
But if this show is so thoroughly touching, and not to mention directly personally relatable, why aren’t I telling you it’s the best anime ever made, even with its lack of necessary intricacy? Because despite its contemplative value being through the roof, its experiential value is at best milquetoast and at worst hellishly tropic and boring. Yes, those scenes I mentioned before were all expertly directed, and yes, the show does work wonders with its subtle tone shifts in color palette and sound design, but outside the moments where Akane Kazuki came in and got to work with his own two hands, the show can be a serious slog. Now the heavy stuff’s over, and this review gets to fizzle out slowly and monotonously like the the show itself did and talk about soft tennis. All that meaningful intrigue I just talked about—believe it or not—is mere garnish to the show’s actual plot: a run of the mill, stock brand, dime-a-dozen highschool sports story. This show isn’t Haikyuu, Run With the Wind, or Welcome to the Ballroom, where the character arcs are weaved through the sport, nor is it One Outs or Baby Steps, where the sport is used to tell a progressive narrative, nor is it Ping Pong: The Animation, which seeks to tell a wholly symbolic and nearly spiritual coming of age story through the sport. It’s just a show about interpersonal drama with healthy theming, which also just happens to have another totally separate story about soft tennis running along side itself. Their progression as a team, their unification as members, and their whole entire underdog story—which is all done quite well, by the way—is completely and totally irrelevant to any and all emotional investment you as a viewer hold in the story, and I simply cannot wrap my head around why they put so much focus on it. This was a show which had me glued to the screen half the time and having it mindlessly playing in the background with me doing work at home the other half of the time—if not outright getting frustrated with it and ratcheting up the playback speed. By the time episode ten and—worse yet—episode eleven rolled around, I started to panic. With so many loose ends hand-waved for the sake of banal episode-long sports anime matches all the way to the finale, which is in itself another match of soft tennis, I had to start looking out for news on this show getting renewed, because while I don’t know if its getting a second season or not, I know for a fact if we didn’t spend so much time playing soft god damn tennis, it wouldn’t even need one! And who knows if this studio could even make a season two any time soon with so many more productions slated for this coming year when the show looked so surprisingly gorgeous?<br />
<br />
The one and only saving grace to the overabundance of soft tennis in a show which was really about way more interesting things at its core—even if an ultimately weak saving grace in comparison—was the outstanding production quality. Be it beautifully lavish, obviously well-researched, life-like character movements, ambitious camerawork maintaining flawless anatomical accuracy, or expertly airy hand-drawn clothing physics, Hoshiai no Sora is an absolute feast for any sakuga nerd, and I find it seriously impressive coming out of this studio. But now that I’ve said how pretty it is, I must be the bitch I am and pick it apart at least a little bit, because while it may rightfully knock the socks off the average viewer, this is no infallible production. First and most obviously, the lavishness and fluidity of the animation is not consistent and mainly focused in the fist handful of episodes, with some speed-lined, single colored backgrounds and panning over stills coming around episodes six and seven, but most would assume this the case anyway. What I really want to talk about is how thick this show is with referencing. Last year, a show about badminton called Hanebado! aired out of studio LIDENFILMS, a studio as historically shaky as 8bit themselves, but to the surprise of the world over, this show was—at least for the most part—heartstoppingly gorgeous. The mind blowingly ambitious shot compositions kept up with by equally jaw dropping sakuga was only describable as an animation celebration. That said, this production quality was inevitably too much to handle, and many of the nonchalant practice matches ended up being fully rotoscoped, and there was one non-rotoscoped match in particular which aired radically unfinished in episode seven. Overall, it was impressive, but as the ambition of the production started tripping up the staff’s footing, the mechanisms keeping it running became blatantly clear. Hoshiai no Sora falls victim to much the same fate. While there is no rotoscoping, they do reuse animation, trace photographs for dense backgrounds, trace live-action dance choreography for their ending animations, and more to the point, they trace CG references. In the first few episodes, everything was hand drawn, but as the show chugged along, I started noticing the background athletes being subbed in by stationary CG models. At first it was as innocuous a development as it was an expected one, but it didn’t take me long to notice the girls’ team playing on the court behind our boys doing full movements, and what oh what were they doing but the same exact fluid motion the characters do in their pretty animations.<br />
<br />
Without press releases, verified quotations, interviews, or production documentaries, I cannot say what this show really aimed to be at heart, but I can say what it felt like. It didn’t feel like an Inio Asano manga or an Umino Chika adaptation, nor did I feel it to be the next Masaaki Yuasa’s Mind Game, or the next Tomihiko Morimi’s Tatami Galaxy, or the next Mamoru Oshii’s Angel’s Egg, any of which are obvious to anyone who can relate to be creations birthed from intensely personal experiences and convictions. Rather, it felt like the work of a man looking in on the hardships of others and—out of honest respect and a splash of scholarly interest—creating a story he felt to both explore and honor the trails and tribulations they’ve gone through, whether or not he truly understood the can of worms he was cracking open himself. It’s an ode to abuse and a reached hand out to those who’ve suffered from it, and while anyone like myself whose also had the misfortune to’ve undergone some of this in their own lives as well will probably find his understanding of the issues and their effects to be more than a little incomplete, I personally think they should all agree with me when I say his sentiment was in the right place, and his creative direction of the concept was skillful enough to be laudable as art and tactful enough to be genuine as cathartic media…even if he stupidly thought it a story best told via monotonous soft tennis.<br />

Thank you for reading.
