    Truly an amazing anime really balanced out as in everything is explained you can&#039;t question anything about any scene or something i loved how they done that..<br />
<br />
Sadly it is underrated alot of people dropped it at the start? the art is kinda okay but what&#039;s more important are the fights and scenes very cool, there&#039;s no overpowered character like most animes or the true main guy owns all no everyone is accounted for everyone in it has a job to do not totally focused on main character<br />
<br />
<br />
I heard that they didn&#039;t continue the anime cause people aren&#039;t talking about it? which is a lame reason..

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223856">
        I look forward to see the rest of the story it&#039;s amazing jumped to be one of my top 10 animes.. <br />
<br />
people need to give it a try atleast 10 episodes or something to see the story and the battles<br />
<br />
Edit: Turns out the writer had health issues &lt;/3 but thank god he got better over the years the anime paused n got back to it!

    People are too quick to call a series a “underrated”. This is because it’s not easy to gauge the popularity of a series in relation to the following you think it &quot;should&quot; have. If I were to make a list of underrated series, that list would be incredibly short. It would also include World Trigger which isn&#039;t a label typically attached to a Weekly Shonen Jump series. An up and comer in WSJ that drew interest in the when it began to air from the mere fact the it ran in that magazine, that interest almost immediately dissipated in the first couple of episodes. Suddenly,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239720">
        everyone remembered that it&#039;s Toei animating the series, and being surprised that a bad animation studio badly animates TV shows, they dropped the series. This is a reminder of how heavily influential the actual animation of an anime is for viewers.<br />
<br />
As per most WSJ series, World Trigger starts off slow introducing its world, concept, and characters, before kicking off into the actual conflict. Enemies come from another dimension, people set up an organization to stop them, right, yes, whatever. Fairly straightforward Jump exposition dumping. Mainly bizarre is the anime’s weird name sense, though does get better later. The series starts out as main character Mikumo Osamu finds out a neighbor, Kuga Yuma, transferred into his school. Things gets more interesting around 10 episodes in when Border finds out what he is and attempt to deal with him, and even more so later when Border comes into conflict with other Neighbor worlds.<br />
<br />
Osamu is extremely weak but he’s well worked as a character. Initially introduced as a morally righteous individual, it was shown in initial scenes that simply being righteous was useless when he gets his ass kicked pathetically by his classmates while Kuga watches. He never gains anything undeserved and doesn&#039;t win just because he&#039;s more virtuous or emotional than his opponent. He struggles with his lack of strength and his goals in the story, often fearing inadequacy and failure. This is really one of the big things that Jump has traded away over the past few years. I certainly do not expect some inner turmoil on par with shows like Evangelion and others, but seeing protagonists struggle with themselves and make mistakes is always welcome. This combines with Osamu&#039;s efforts to improve which are well thought out and interesting to watch. Though somewhat smart his honesty, despite the potential self damage it incurs, is appealing. It creates a good underdog character. And most of the characters run along similar lines of characterization.<br />
<br />
Shonen Jump has a tendency to constantly have the MC in the spotlight before all else as the recognizable face of the series. Whenever there’s a big fight, the MC is always in the lead, even if the fight has little to do with him. He may or may not give a big speech rebuking his opponent, often with little actual relevance to that conflict. Osamu is the antithesis of this. The MC doesn’t preach to the opposition, or the viewership, which gets highly annoying and silly if not meaningful. Characters are no longer shoved into some the unnecessary “good guy” and “bad guy” categories. <br />
<br />
This means that characters have to more be defined by their thoughts and actions as people, not just as a hero or villain. This helps the author bring attention to the vast cast without having the audience first watch a huge amount of content. It’s frequent that a huge cast is introduced and only really make a small amount of that huge cast is interesting, or they all end up boring even if a huge amount of time is spent on the characters. They&#039;re all just there to make up numbers, but it doesn&#039;t feel that way with World Trigger. This is because they don&#039;t take up huge amounts of screen time or hold big 1v1 battles involving irrelevant characters. <br />
<br />
The power system is actually quite interesting for the series. Fighting series are defined and remembered by their power systems. World Trigger is no different. Jojo, One Piece, DBZ, Hakusho are all examples of this done positively. Usually most shonen series which involve abilities usually center around everyone having their own unique ability, but that&#039;s not the case. The system is simple, but the way it&#039;s implemented makes it a great system as it still allows creativity but does away with individual gimmicks of one character having a silly overpowered ability, or powering up until he has one. <br />
<br />
World Trigger’s trion system resembles a video game in its use. The show places tangible importance on the skills of the individual user, how they use what they have, the situation they are in, and how they fight with those around them. This is what make the battles truly exciting in World Trigger. They rely more so on strategy and very rarely if ever is there an outright power battle between two characters. It enticing to see how each character uses the weapons along with their own skills. And even if you&#039;re stronger, it&#039;s possible to lose in a way that&#039;s not an asspull designed just so the protagonist can win. While I do love to see a couple characters duke it out and try to kick each other’s ass every now and then, this is fun and refreshing in its own right.<br />
<br />
I bring up Jump, the target Shounen demographic, and other shows that make these strange errors frequently because that’s the standard. Those are all the tropes and oft-used clichés. Those are all the unnecessary additives along with the annoying detractions that appear in this specific genre, particularly recently. These series hold a lot in common with each other and end up stiffly adhering to a formula to satisfy an audience and they fail to hold the entertain value that they strive for because of it. There’s definitely good in World Trigger, but that comes out because it doesn’t do basic things improperly. It doesn’t do things that are unnecessary, out of character, or out of line.<br />
<br />
As for the animation, I mentioned that the first 10 episodes are quite slow, but any further pacing issues come down to how this show was animated and directed. World Trigger&#039;s first 10 or so episodes look god awful, plain and simple. Stills, the rehashed Trigger activation animation, and occasional strange lack of frames in scenes contribute to this. Luckily, they managed to get rid of 2 of these problems as the show goes on.<br />
<br />
The main issue that persisted is the stills. I found them strangely endearing at times and they got me to laugh at their placement and how unbelievable it was. There are frequents moments in each episode where the frame sits on a character&#039;s face for several seconds as they say/do absolutely nothing. In most other anime, you&#039;d see panning shots and some sort of camera movement or change in perspective when there is no dialogue to keep the viewer occupied. <br />
<br />
Various scenes are also censored even though most action takes place in a fake body. It’s annoying, but bearable. Even with these problems World Trigger may be the best animated of Toei&#039;s TV works of the current century, particularly with how underwhelming One Piece is and what little I&#039;ve seen of Dragonball Super. This should be fairly embarrassing. All fight scenes are done pretty nicely and it&#039;s nice to see that Toei at least doesn&#039;t slack off here.<br />
<br />
This is the first time I&#039;ve seen an OP/ED stuck in the middle of an episode. They&#039;re good though and for the most part the OST is as well. Toei still uses the same old not so dramatic sound effects that we&#039;ve heard all the way back since DBZ aired. You&#039;ll also find it in One Piece. This helps to draw out various stills and take up episode time.<br />
<br />
Really I&#039;m surprised by how much I enjoyed the anime as I was expected to eventually drop it and just go with the manga like with One Piece, but it worth at looking into. <br />
<br />
The filler sucks so don&#039;t watch it. It’s genuinely like they tried to put Pokemon battles in World Trigger. It’s insane.<br />

    Unlike most people, I personally loved this anime. I understand the first few episode wasn’t so great but we need to look at a bigger picture right. Most people say the art is terrible but I think it’s alright. As for the story, I find it very interesting. you will a little confused in the beginning but as you continue, you’ll fully understand it and enjoy it. The character development is a bit slow, however, I think are great for a shounen anime. I agree that sound aren’t really impressive but view as a whole, I think it was really worth it to watch it!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221119">
        Sometimes, people have a negative point of view of an anime when they start watching it because of bad reviews but I think everyone should really try to have a good mindset and determine a anime by yourself. Just because other don’t enjoy it doesn&#039;t mean you would. Everyone has a different taste, right? As for the conclusion, I hope everyone can watch this anime by their self! Give it some time! You’ll enjoy it as the serie goes on!

    The 2010s era of anime was a great time for shounen jump anime adaptations because, for the most part, all the shounen jump adaptations were not only great in terms of quality but they managed to be near perfect adaptations. Sure some of them had filler episodes in it but compared to other shounen jump anime adaptations from the past decade or two they were pretty good for what they are despite being non-canon. Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, Bakuman, Hunter x Hunter 2011 and My Hero Academia are the some of the best examples of this of how to adapt the source maternal correctly as well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279503">
        having its own charm in the mix.<br />
Now out of all the anime series from shounen jump that came out in the last 8 years, I feel like World Trigger is the most underrated of the bunch.<br />
Why is that you may ask?<br />
You&#039;re soon going to find out.<br />
<br />
Story.<br />
<br />
In Mikado City Humans are overwhelmed at first when their weapons are found to be useless against Neighbors, until a mysterious organization appears that is able to repel the Neighbors&#039; attacks. The organization is called the National Defence Agency, or &quot;Border,&quot; and has appropriated the Neighbor technology called &quot;Triggers,&quot; which allows the user to channel an internal energy called Trion and use it as a weapon or for other purposes. By activating a trigger, the body of users is replaced by a battle-body made of trion which is stronger and more resistant. Members of Border are divided in three ranks, A, B, and C, with only the members of rank A possessing the most powerful triggers, comparable in strength to those of Neighbors.<br />
<br />
Four years later Mikado City has gotten used with the occasional battles with the Neighbors and have returned more or less to their everyday lives. The story follows a Yuma Kuga who transfers to Third Mikado City Middle School where he meets another boy named who is a Border Agent. However, it turns out that Yuma is actually a Humanoid Neighbor, and his arrival signifies that not all is what it seems in the war against the Neighbors.<br />
<br />
The story is pretty good for the most part.<br />
<br />
For starters, World Trigger does a great job at establishing its own world and setting.<br />
<br />
Border is not like your typical shounen school setting which forces character interaction right down your through between set characters, it doesn&#039;t force countless written exams in such upon character for basic characterization but instead Border functions like an organization where no one is characterized solely of how overpowered and smart they but instead the method in which they come about them.<br />
<br />
The power system for world trigger was very interesting as well being well expanded it great detail. The Trion system in World Trigger resembles like a video game where you have to master the class purpose in combat as well mastering its skills for that class to deal with situations that they are in so they can fight back. This reason alone is why I adored the fight structure in World Trigger because instead a of having a bunch of overpowered characters ganging up on strong foe where they will most likely get defeated unless the writer does a random asspull the characters in World Trigger actually have to work together by communicatingwith each other as well planning out strategies and tactics to defeat their foes. Thanks to the great fight structuring the fights in World Trigger are extremely unpredictable to a point where you never know who is going to win in the end which adds more tension to the fights and because of this all the arcs minus that filler was all fun watch even if the pacing of the show can be a bit too slow at times which I will talk about in a bit.<br />
The one thing that World Trigger was successful is its themes of teamwork and commutation where characters have to get along as well synergize with each other in order to win fights.<br />
<br />
As much I praise the story of World Trigger as well how different it was in terms of setting, unfortunately, it has two flaws that completely hold it back from being one of the greats. I&#039;m, honestly not going to pretend that World Trigger has great pacing, in fact, World Trigger at various times has pacing issues where it’s too slow to a point where certain parts of the show where there were no fights involve just seemed to drag on to a point where at times the show can get boring to sit through. Personality the pacing in World Trigger didn’t bother me all that much as I am used to shows that have slow pacing but I do acknowledge that it’s a problem especially for fans of the shounen genre who are very used to fast-paced shounen like Naruto, Fairy Tail and My Hero Academia.<br />
<br />
While the pacing issues in World Trigger didn’t bother me that all that much the second and final flaw almost completely ruined the show for me. The arc that I am talking about is the Fugitive Arc. As much I really liked World Trigger as a whole I simply cannot defend that arc. Not only it was a filler arc that was not good but the directing, writing and even the visuals were at an all-time low in that arc. Plus the new characters in that dreadful arc are contrived morons who were extremely unlikeable and they are just as interesting as watching grass grow. Am not joking. Lucky for me I skipped that arc during my re-watch of the show and as soon as episode 48 I jumped straight to episode 63 and nothing was lost in the progress.<br />
<br />
If you’re planning to watch World Trigger skip episodes 49-63 because that’s where the cringe-fest filler arc begins and honestly the less you know about that arc the better.<br />
<br />
Overall besides the horrendous filler arc that shouldn’t exist as having pacing issues at times, I really liked the story for World Trigger as it’s very different to many shounen series from the past in terms of setting.<br />
<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
<br />
World Trigger has a large characters cast but at the same time, they managed to a good job of handling it’s character cast minus the one in the Fugitive arc because they are shit and not worth mentioning in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Yuma is a pretty interesting character. Despite his lack of knowledge of Japanese culture and customs acts as almost a social critique of Japanese society. Yuma openly states how he doesn&#039;t approve of specific traditions and the &quot;way things are&quot; in Japan, which really delivers a message to the audience in the form of social critique which was a nice touch to this series. I also adored his character interactions with the other characters in this series as they are often interesting as well being hilarious to watch. Yuma character interactions along made me chuckle a lot. Besides Yuma being funny he is also a strong character who gets developed very well and his backstory overall was nicely told it honestly made me tear quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Jin is a badass character that I loved. I loved his layback personality as well being a general badass on screen. I also liked his views of the Neighbor where despite losing his mother to a Neighbor he still thinks that not all Neighbor are enemies where he also thinks that humans and neighbors should be friends showing that both races could co-exist. This is the stuff that I love about anime.<br />
<br />
I honestly have mixed feelings towards Osamu. I like the fact that he’s different when compared to most shounen protagonist where they are overpowered he starts off from the bottom where he is literally a weak fighter. While I like the fact, he starts off as a weak fighter I thought he never really got stronger as a character. Yes did a bit stronger as the series went on the problem he always seemed to get ass kicked by many characters in the series. However, while he&#039;s not a good fighter his determined to prove everyone wrong completely makes up as we the viewer can sympathize with. However, I will admit that he can quite be a boring character at times especially in the first couple of episodes.<br />
<br />
Besides that, I thought Osamu was a decent character.<br />
<br />
Now for my least favorite character in the series minus the god-awful filler ones Chika.<br />
<br />
Okay, I don’t hate Chika by any means, in fact, she is an okay character. The problem with Chika is she is literally a coward in battle. I understand that she is a kid and all but there were moments in the series where Team Osamu could have won if Chika actually shot someone in battle. Also, Chika kinda of getting on my nerves as the series get on as she never wants to shot someone in even though she has great sniper skills. Just like a shitty pacifist fighter where they hate violence even though they are in a war zone where they no choice to fight and that pacifist will only preach they lungs out of why war is wrong. Also, out of all the charters in World Trigger, she is the blandest character in the series. She’s being just eye candy for the viewer where she’s only cute nothing more nothing less.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the rest of the characters in World Trigger, I was honestly shocked of how well handled and unique they are. They are not the typical throwaway side characters that you will see in most other shounen like Naruto where they don’t get any real screen time. The supporting characters in world trigger all get adequate screen time alongside this show over the course of its run abandons focusing on its main trio multiple times allowing other characters in the show to shine as well consequently demonstrating it’s fantastic job in avoiding the creation of a story that where every event and character interaction just serves the purpose of affecting only one to two characters *cough Naruto Shippuuden.*<br />
<br />
Some of my favorite side characters in world trigger include Souya, Shuuji, Kyousuke, Yousuke, Shiori, Shun, Ai and my personal favorite character in this series Kirie.<br />
<br />
Overall apart from Chika the characters in World Trigger were pretty great and enjoyable for what they were.<br />
<br />
8.5/10<br />
<br />
Visuals.<br />
When it comes to the visuals for World Trigger my thoughts on were rather mixed.<br />
<br />
For starters, I really like how colorful it was. Instead of being colorful like in a typical fantasy setting it uses a sci-fi color pallet as we see a lot a lot of blues, whites, blacks and greens are used for the background scenery. The characters designs are all pretty unique, and they stand out very well from each other which was good because I was sick of tired at seeing similar character designs cough *Gundam Seed.* Unfortunately, since this show was done by Toei Animation the characters at times can go off model especially in the first couple of episodes.<br />
<br />
As for the actual animation, it’s just decent at best. Sure at times this show can be well animated at that can deliver some great fight choreography but for the most part, the show uses basic animation with a quite a lot of still frames. It’s pretty sad really because if this show was done by Madhouse or Bones than the animation would be amazing. However, I will give Toei this it’s one of the better-looking shows especially when you compare to the likes of Digimon Xros Wars, Dragon Ball Super and Sailor Moon Crystal where they are consistently being a slide show filled with consistent art failures and choppy animation. Also unlike those shows, World Trigger visually gets better but it sadly will never be My Hero Academia good which is pretty sad. While the show is visually decent for the most part, the battles make it up.<br />
Overall the visuals in World Trigger are pretty decent, and I don’t think it’s bad as everyone thinks it is and the strategic battles of the series completely make it up.<br />
6.5/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack in World Trigger is fantastic. At first, I didn’t really care about the soundtrack during my first watch of World Trigger, however, as I re-watch this show I started to notice how great and well created the soundtrack is. Every single track in World Trigger is memorable, and they fit well with the tone and setting perfectly. Easily in my top 30 favorite anime soundtracks.<br />
<br />
World Trigger has 3 opening themes and surprising no ending theme whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The first opening theme GIRIGIRI by Sonar Pocket is a good opening theme that fits with mood with the first 23 episodes. The second and third opening themes Ashita no Hikari by AAA and Dream Trigger by Pile are some of my favorite anime opening periods. They are just a joy to listen to.<br />
Now for sub vs dub.<br />
The sub is great overall that is filled with a lot of well known talented Seiyuus.<br />
I only have seen some clips of the dub on YouTube and I thought it was good overall despite being a bit cheesy in nature. I hope the dub get’s release someday on the net as well having a Blu-Ray release because I would be the Blu Ray for World Trigger in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
So after re-watching World Trigger for the second time what do I think about it?<br />
<br />
I still think World Trigger is a pretty good shounen series that has a lot of great things in it. The story, for the most part, was pretty good and interesting, the tone was great, and most of the characters are great that have a lot of charm into them and the music/voice acting was great. It does fall in the few areas, though. The pacing was too slow for the most part. The animation wasn’t that constant and the filler arc overall was terrible that shouldn’t exist and you should completely skip it. Despite that, I still liked World Trigger for what it is. If this show was done by any other studio than this show would had been a lot more popular but since it was done by Toei it quickly dived in the underrated territory while Assassination Classroom, Food Wars, Black Clover, Boruto My Hero Academia and Haikyuu have gained the shounen jump spotlight which is a shame because I actually liked World Trigger more than Boruto and Food Wars.<br />
<br />
As a shounen jump adaptation, this was a pretty good one overall minus the filler arc and pacing issues in the beginning.<br />
<br />
Despite its shortcomings, I still think World Trigger was a pretty damm good show that I recommend to people. Just make sure you skip episodes 49-63 because that&#039;s where that filler arc start and it&#039;s not worth watching in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Final Score 8/10

    First things first, this anime is very underrated and gets picked on way to much. The animation style gets the most backlash however once I got used to it I actually really enjoyed the style used. The characters were lovable and interesting and I got sucked into the story really fast.<br />
<br />
The only downfall I can think of this the ending as it felt unsatisfying and was a let down, we just have to hope that there will be a 3rd season.<br />
Over all I really enjoyed this World Trigger, with it&#039;s characters and pleasant art style it has really stolen my heart. I really recommend watching

    The STORY of World Trigger don&#039;t go anywhere and ends incomplete like nothing really happen in 73 slow episodes , talking about the setting this is explore superficially is pseudo-science that most of the time its told by powerful teenagers that apparently are more smart than adults of there superiors creatures in this world.  Talking about the CHARACTERS the principal cast most are super smart and powerful teenagers , as i said the teenagers are super smart but in other times are only fools that only fight then start to cry and make determination dialogues to win then are super smart again , the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227828">
        enemies are the same but are evil adults that apparently are more mature but inferior to teenagers there personalities and development are very unbalanced also there is more characters that stereotypes of shonen  are only to make the principal characters more superiors or only waste time. The ART is simple poor the move in fights even in times that is not action is clumsy and the music is forgettable. For a final thought the series is more for teenagers that like rule of cool vibrates and feel superior even most of the enemies are describe by evil adults but this is a excuse to give a 2/10 even i can said that the of the series writers  think that teenagers are stupid so make this kind of shows<br />

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
I have a personal tradition for Christmas.<br />
<br />
Every time the holidays roll around, and I am out and about getting gifts for my parents, I always make sure to pick them up a couple of ornaments. A new Santa one for my father, and a new snowman one for my mother. Fancy. Cute. Interesting. Whatever the make, I make sure that whichever I choose is a fun one to unwrap.<br />
<br />
If World Trigger were a gift, I would never give it to my parents. I would never give it to any of my friends or strangers on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review271437">
        the street. I wouldn’t even give it to my sworn nemesis.<br />
<br />
It’s that deplorable.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
In a world where evil Neighbors invade and Triggers are used, Osamu, a teenage boy yearning to become a member of the protective Border Agency, has a fateful encounter with an even younger boy named Yuma. Yuma, as it turns out, is also a Neighbor, but he has come to make peace not war. These two, together with their close friend Chika, find themselves supporting one another as they face the troubles laid out on their path.<br />
<br />
This description is not a thorough one for World Trigger, for the anime is seventy-three episodes long. True, it is not as long as those most popular, long-running shows, but seventy-three is not a number to scoff. After all, the majority of anime are either twelve or twenty-four episodes in length.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, its length is also its downfall.<br />
<br />
Repetition is a concept that many people are familiar with. Especially if they watch anime or take part in discussing them. Repetition can be a positive if it is used as a plot point or as a thematic element. Often, though, it is a negative, demonstrating a show’s inability to add variety or a need to linger on the same events, outcomes, and character appeals.<br />
<br />
World Trigger takes it several leaps further.<br />
<br />
It’s almost astounding how much the show repeats itself. Take its in-world knowledge. The different weapons, the types of Neighbors, how the structure of Border works. A lot of time is set aside to explain these arguably minor details. A smart move. Giving the audience more about how everything operates is (usually) worthwhile.<br />
<br />
But, in what can only be described as a blunder, the anime has this segment at the end of almost every episode called “World Trigger Fun Facts.” There, they repeat much of the same information that was already given. Those weapons? Here they are again with next to nothing new added. Those Neighbors? Covered once more with the same information. Those rankings? S, A, B, C is “tough” to remember, so it’ll be wise to break it down again.<br />
<br />
These “fun” facts do not stop here because, once the anime reaches roughly past the halfway mark, it begins to repeat the same info from previous segments. The guns, the Neighbors, the rankings. A lot of it is repeated – again.<br />
<br />
Repetition continues with Yuma’s infamous pout where, for “comedic” purposes, Yuma purses his lips and dons three horizontal lines for eyes. A repeated gesture that is basically a characteristic but gets used in almost every situation by him (and others). (Thankfully, the anime calms this down a bit as events get more serious later, but it still appears at a nominal rate.)<br />
<br />
How about always displaying the names, ages, and roles of the different characters no matter how many times they are seen? The invariance of enemies? A need to litter every battle with explanatory dialogue rather than letting them play out?<br />
<br />
Yet the worst (best?) example is each episode’s opening. In almost every single episode, the anime replays a fixed reel with narration played on top of it. While it can change when the arc does – about once every fifteen episodes or so (so about five different sets in total) – it takes up roughly a minute and thirty seconds of that episode’s time. Which in turn takes away the show’s chances of doing something not repetitive.<br />
<br />
The kicker? The anime will then proceed to replay exact scenes from the previous episode. As though the reels were not repetitive enough, the show makes its audience sit through reused material that contains verbatim dialogue and replicated events as if it’s expected.<br />
<br />
Episode forty-one is particularly egregious: The first four minutes and twenty seconds are literally the overused reel and copy-pasted content from the previous episode.<br />
<br />
The repetition is horrible, but, somehow, the anime does not stop hitting itself in the face.<br />
<br />
Pacing manages to be a problem. The first arc is recognizably slow as the show takes way too much time in setting up its characters, world, and general atmosphere for roughly twenty-one episodes. During this span, the anime does have a couple of battles and a bigger fight break out to help minimize the monotony, but it is still noticeably slowed down.<br />
<br />
From episode twenty-two to thirty-five, the anime enters its large-scale-Neighborhood-invasion arc, and it is at this point that pacing goes out the portal. Over the course of these fourteen episodes, the anime stretches out hours of in-world time, slowing everything down again. It even goes so far as to extend seconds of in-world time (into minutes of airing time), killing any reasoning for the pacing.<br />
<br />
World Trigger gets its pacing wrong again when it halts the progression of its B-Rank-Wars arc in favor of the Xeno-and-Lilith arc. Doing so killed the build-up, the sense of progression that Osamu, Yuma, and Chika had been making. It resumes the B-Rank-Wars arc later, sure, but, by that point, the paced-based damage had been done.<br />
<br />
And as if the show could not get any worse, it makes some questionable choices throughout its run.<br />
<br />
That Xeno-and-Lilith arc has no consequence on the events within the season. The idea is that what the group did will pay dividends sometime in the future. But, for the here and now, the arc represents nothing more than an unnecessary diversion (especially since they were supposed to be training but had to deal with this whole conflict instead).<br />
<br />
The idea behind triggers switching out one’s physical body for a virtual one, while futuristic, removes a lot of tension since their actual bodies are in no real danger.<br />
<br />
Episode sixty interjects the arc that already interjected the arc before it. It’s meant to be a comedic one-off starring “Tamakoma branch’s most powerful member,” but it has no place in the occurring narrative.<br />
<br />
Even how the season concludes raises eyebrows. It chooses to make the cutoff right as the newest Neighbor invasion starts as well as right before Osamu and the others go into the pivotal B-Rank match.<br />
<br />
The latter tears the muscles around the eye. They aimed to win the B-Rank wars (and thus go on the away missions into the Neighborhood) all the way back in episode eleven. Meaning, even after the remaining sixty or so episodes unravel, the show fails to accomplish its original goal for the season.<br />
<br />
All these problems are bad on their own, but, again, they occur across seventy-three episodes. In other words, the repetition, the pacing, and the poor writing choices are each compounded, exacerbated by the long length of the season, turning these problems from intolerable to wholly insufferable.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
World Trigger has a clear positive in its visual arsenal: The trigger transformation sequence. Blue-and-purple, space-like effects spread over the characters as their virtual bodies replace their physical ones. It’s fancy-looking, and it works.<br />
<br />
But it’s repetitive.<br />
<br />
Oh, do not be mistaken. Repetition does not stop with the story. The transformation gets a pass because it at least tries to be interesting. But Yuma’s squinting face? The drab teal outfits? Osamu’s glasses constantly fogging up on only one lens to make him seem serious when, in actuality, it only makes it look as if he does not treat his eyewear with proper care?<br />
<br />
The setting, too. The show almost exclusively takes place in the same city and within the same Border headquarters. It would not be a problem if the anime attempted to spruce up these areas given that they are seen all the time. Nope. It’s the same low-detailed, repetitive locations.<br />
<br />
It does try to break up the monotony with its weapons and its enemies, but these, too, suffer from lack of intrigue. The weapons are mostly swords and shields (and their variants) that go without any distinguishing characteristics besides their yellow-laser composition. And the enemies are giant, bug-like creatures that go featureless save for their same giant-eye weak-point.<br />
<br />
Among the rough, its Black Triggers, which it claims are powerful and unique, are, in fact, powerful and unique. Portal creation, translucent-Trion-coagulating birds, and an all-reaching blade stake their claim as the top-tier gear. If only because everything else is so abysmally tame. (Indeed, the Black Triggers make one wonder what could have been had the show given a similar level of attention to its other parts.)<br />
<br />
At the very least, the anime’s character designs are not awful. Yes, Osamu is too plain, Chika’s mouth is oddly triangular, and Yuma already needs to dye his hair as a teenager. But, considering the size of the cast, the changes to hair color, pupil formation, body image, styles, and accessories help to differentiate the characters while also giving them their own personalities. Kirie, in particular, gets a brand-new look when she turns on her trigger: a winged hairstyle as well as a light-green outfit.<br />
<br />
Then it goes right back to being intolerable with subpar actual animation. The fights are not given enough room to breathe, characters usually only move their mouths, and everybody has a hard time even walking around the room as they discuss the same set of topics for the umpteenth time. At least the glowing cube pieces dart around, right?<br />
<br />
A few negative shout-outs are still in order.<br />
<br />
The first goes to the visuals for the second ML (acronym explained later) track. Having each character “sing” a portion of the song is not cool in the slightest. Especially when Chika, a female, lip syncs a male’s voice.<br />
<br />
The second goes to the final episode. It is somehow leagues worse than all the episodes before it. Disproportionate heads, stiff animation, and weak choreography end the anime with even more distaste.<br />
<br />
The third goes to the “fun” facts epilogues. They went cutesy and minimalist to fit their “fun” mood, but it really just seems as though the anime was cutting corners with the cutouts.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
World Trigger is yet another anime with a massive cast, reaching about one-hundred distinct characters. Therefore, just the main four will be investigated: Chika, Jin, Yuma, and Osamu.<br />
<br />
Chika is a young girl who finds herself attracting the evil Neighbors. It’s not her fault, for she simply contains an unbelievable amount of Trion (especially for someone of her size). Her indirect relation with the Neighbors caused her to distance herself from others in order to protect them, leaving her in a spot without too many friends.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Chika, and early on, the show reveals that not only did the Neighbors kidnap one of her close friends, but also her brother went missing beyond the rift, too. In retaliation, Chika enlists herself at Border to save those that were taken from her.<br />
<br />
Her gargantuan Trion levels made her gun-type role a no-brainer. With a sniper in tow, she can literally raze entire hills, earning her the nickname “Cannon.”<br />
<br />
The beginning of the season only gives the audience the tidbits to her background and motivations. The middle section has her being the target of Aftokrator because, to them, she is the “golden baby bird” they were seeking. In other words, Chika does not do a whole lot for a long while.<br />
<br />
Not until the last one-third or so does a new characteristic officially enter the field: She cannot shoot people.<br />
<br />
Her mental obstacle is extremely annoying since it comes off as a cheap excuse to stop her from decimating the competition (when most of her foes are in no danger of dying anyway). But it does give her the chance to grow. She eventually manages to fire her gun as well as changes to a different setup that plays to her strengths. Namely, her huge store of Trion.<br />
<br />
Is Chika a strong character? No. Mostly since she’s relegated to the side without accomplishing much. However, she’s the best of the four – and that is telling.<br />
<br />
Jin is notable for his amazing “Side Effect,” special abilities that certain characters possess. His Side Effect is reading the future. He cannot predict it, but he can see the various intersections as well as influence which one the world could take.<br />
<br />
If that were not enough, he has his own Black Trigger, making him one of, if not the, most powerful Border agent.<br />
<br />
Jin does receive some attention early on, being the one that inspired Osamu to put his all into joining Border. And he interacts with Osamu and his group often enough, getting them a spot at his branch as well as looking out for them elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, his character starts to go downhill shortly after.<br />
<br />
Jin gives up his Black Trigger, sensing (through his Side Effect) that it would be for the best to let others wield it, reducing his overall impact and coolness. Then, after warning about Osamu’s potential death during the Aftokrator arc, he basically vanishes, appearing only a handful of times without having any impact on the events at hand.<br />
<br />
Jin even (way later) turns down Osamu’s invite to their group, a bold move to make Osamu’s team that much stronger.<br />
<br />
Which begs the question: Why is Jin even considered a main character let alone plastered on the front of the anime’s main graphic? His background is not investigated, he does not have an internal conflict, and he sits on the sidelines for a large chunk of the show. In all regards, he’s a massive step down from Chika.<br />
<br />
Yuma is technically a stronger character than Jin but not by much. Yuma is a humanoid Neighbor, something that Osamu and the others had never heard of before. Yuma, alongside his trusty pal Replica, has a Black Trigger of his own, granting him boosted powers and increased battle prowess.<br />
<br />
But, as his background shows, he does not necessarily need it. When he was in the Neighborhood, he was with his dad, learning about fighting, skills, and battle tactics. In other words, he was already a seasoned fighter.<br />
<br />
Sadly, a dark entity maimed Yuma, forcing his father to sacrifice himself. In exchange for his life, he creates Yuma’s Black Trigger, saving Yuma by placing his body within it. I.e., Yuma’s current body is actually a fake.<br />
<br />
All this information on Yuma is revealed rather early on (mainly episode eleven). And, to be fair, it is welcome info. The problem is that that is all Yuma has.<br />
<br />
He’s already a versatile fighter, so the battles do not mean much to him. The show never goes back to the Neighborhood, so he does not get context on his background. And he does not have any notable interactions with any of the other cast members, including Chika and Osamu.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Osamu, he is easily the worst of the bunch. From the very beginning, it’s obvious that Osamu has no latent strengths. He is not suited for Border due to his lack of fighting experience and his lack of Trion. He only gets recognized when Yuma gives him the credit for saving the school.<br />
<br />
And that’s Osamu’s character for the rest of the show. He is constantly trying to find an out. He is constantly looking for help. He is constantly doing what he can to not be useless.<br />
<br />
It would have been tolerable had he actually grown at a steady pace, but, at every junction, World Trigger seems intent on keeping Osamu at a below-average state for the entire season.<br />
<br />
His crawl is realistic, sure. Going from the absolute bottom to even near the middle of the pack would not (should not) happen overnight. But the anime is seventy-three episodes long. What is normally a crawl turns into an excruciatingly slow waddle that barely gets him past the base of his figurative character mountain.<br />
<br />
This problem is World Trigger’s biggest. It fails to use its very long season to its advantage. Instead, the show’s main four not only reach a new level of stagnation but also fail to feel meaningful to the story at large.<br />
<br />
One argument in favor of the cast is their roles. Yuma’s the ace fighter, Chika’s the overpowered sniper, and Osamu’s the tactician. They form a solid group whose weaknesses are covered by each other. For instance, Yuma takes on the toughest enemies, Chika destroys landmarks when needed, and Osamu develops the plans.<br />
<br />
Their composition, however, is not enough to elevate their individual persons.<br />
<br />
The best character World Trigger has to offer is not out of these four; it’s Xeno. He confronts the main group, has a personal conflict in trusting others, gets his background explored, holds a special relationship with Lilith, and resolves his conflict when he befriends the others and escapes the planet.<br />
<br />
But one strong side character – a character that is inconsequential to the proceedings – is not enough to save this anime from the abyss.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
World Trigger, surprisingly, does something unique. Not good unique but unique nevertheless: It does not have an OP or an ED. Oh, no. Instead, the anime created a brand-new entity.<br />
<br />
The middle track (or ML for short).<br />
<br />
Remember those repetitive reels? They almost always play at the beginning of each episode, leaving no time for an OP to play. And remember those “fun” facts? They almost always play at the end of each episode, so an ED has no place. That leaves the meat of the episode. The important parts. The middle.<br />
<br />
So, World Trigger, being World Trigger, does not care. With its ML in hand, it will interrupt the flow of the episode to make sure the audience hears what it has to offer. Sometimes twelve minutes in, sometimes a staggering fourteen minutes and thirty seconds in. It must play it.<br />
<br />
What is heard? The first ML has fast lyrics, but the “change the new world” English bit and the boring background beat squash any hope the song has at becoming listenable. The second ML tries really hard to be cool, with its different vocalists and fade out, but it comes off as incredibly lame since the anime is simply not on the same coolness level. As for the third ML, it stands above its brethren, but that’s not saying much. Its first half is uninspired, but the second half at least has some nice vocal work and a varying pace, making it the only passable piece of the bunch.<br />
<br />
When the ML is not playing, the rest of the original soundtrack does instead. The tracks are often slow, ambient tunes, relying on flutes, drums, and reverb effects to strike at the slice-of-life, action, and sci-fi moods. They’re forgettable pieces, overshadowed by the ML’s strangeness.<br />
<br />
Not to be outdone, voice acting missed the mark. Megumi Urawa as Youtarou was annoying to hear, and Tomo Muranaka as Yuma sounded too disinterested. The others failed to impress.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
You know what’s ironic? My favorite part of the entire show happens to be repetitive.<br />
<br />
Kirie and Kyousuke’s running gag, where he lies, she believes him, and then she proceeds to pound on Osamu or whoever else is nearby for “tricking” her, miraculously made me smile. In this swathing sea of dislike, I did, indeed, find something I liked.<br />
<br />
The cat, too. His emotionless stare and laziness was likable.<br />
<br />
And those are the only parts I liked.<br />
<br />
Kitora was a huge jerk to Osamu for no other reason besides thinking he was coddled too much by everybody else. Chika always bailing out during the fights, rather than trying to help Osamu and Yuma, got on my nerves. Osamu’s half-fogged glasses.<br />
<br />
Can’t say I liked the action with its boring shoot-outs. I did not have much in the way of romance to cheer for. Takeru’s “comedy” made me want to punch myself in the face. And don’t even get me started again on the show’s inept repetition.<br />
<br />
Is this the worst anime that I have ever seen? Maybe. If nothing else, it is trapped at the bottom with the other lowest-execution anime.<br />
<br />
World Trigger is a boring mess. The story is repetitive. The characters are stagnated. The art is lame. The music has no timing. The entertainment value is minimal. The anime is an ornament that shattered into seventy-three different pieces: worthless.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Terrible, horrible repetition, elongates seconds to minutes, and does not even have relevant narrative arcs<br />
<br />
Animation: Bad, boring setting, below average actual animation, and okay character designs<br />
<br />
Characters: Terrible, stagnation in Osamu, Yuma, Chika, and Jin’s characters prevent them from finding purpose or value<br />
<br />
Sound: Terrible, bad ML’s, bad OST, bad VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Terrible, a running gag and a cat do not cover this year-and-a-half slog<br />
<br />
Final Score: 1/10

    (Sorry guys, had to re-upload this! Rating is still 10/10!)<br />
<br />
I&#039;m going to have to disagree with the opinion a lot of people seem to get from first impressions of this anime. I love it, especially the universe, plot, and characters. Worth giving a chance and continuing to watch. I&#039;m addicted! I love the universe they created, and I&#039;d watch a second series in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The first thing people complain about is the art, but I think that has more to do with how almost every anime these days has very cookie-cutter animation, so when one comes out that has a different style people drop it

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243456">
        for that sole reason-- preconceived notions abound. JoJo has extremely silly animation, but since it is rather famous already people get passed that, and start to actually enjoy it FOR the animation instead of disliking it because of it. It was the same for World Trigger. I enjoy that it has a unique animation style, it reminds me of the same vein as Gash Bell, or Nanatsu no Taizai; both of which I really enjoy for their iconic nature.<br />
<br />
The art is simple, but it works well for this sort of story, it doesn&#039;t need overly complex effects to get the point across, in fact that would be very out of character. If you are the type to drop something or judge based on art alone, I would recommend giving this one a chance and watching it through while trying to fix that way of thinking. I wouldn&#039;t consider the art bad at all, just simple. Other very famous anime have similar styles, so it shouldn&#039;t have that much sway. Keep going, give it a chance.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is something I really enjoy. Other dimensions are a common trope, but World Trigger is done in such a way to make it unique and really gives you a complete universe to believe in. At first it may seem just like another dimension/shounen battle plot, but once it starts to open up and reveal the underlying nuances, you start to understand that there is a whole other dimension (no pun intended) to the plot, where it parallels real life social issues and moral concepts. You want to stand behind the MC, and fight against the evils and injustices the bureaucracy has put in place (or Border HQ). The plot is shown in such a way where that you slowly learn new things about Neighbors, Border, Trion, and even Yuuma little by little in each episode. This builds up to some bigger fights and conclusions later on, and since there&#039;s so much information, this is definitely the best way to get it all out there so we really get what is going to happen later on.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
I really like the choice of Seiyuu, and feel each has their own fitting narrative. I have a pretty dry sense of humor, so the subtle dry humor they use is just perfect for me, I also love the social nuances, like pauses and sweet drops at just the right moments to make it hilarious. Older anime uses this technique a lot more often (Like in Gash Bell), whereas these days they tend to make more verbal jokes, which I don&#039;t really enjoy nearly as much most of the time.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
And now for the character portion. Aside from plot I think this would be my favorite aspect of the show, I love the depth of character! At first you are thrown in without knowing anything but the basics of who these people are, but gradually you learn and more, especially about Yuuma, and it makes you feel a real connection to the characters and want to urge them on to get stronger and find ways to beat the odds. Yuuma has a much more complex past than you first suspect, and it just continues to get more interesting. Osamu is pretty average, but that&#039;s what also makes him relatable. He doesn&#039;t start out as much but his character is the type that grows more complex and matures as the series does- so you personally witness the changes in him as he grows and becomes stronger. I don&#039;t think there were any major changes in him until he goes through his first big trial (roughly one third through the series), but I think that works out perfectly. Yuuma draws you in, and Osamu keeps you wanting more. It&#039;s just these two for the first few episodes of the series, getting you acquainted, but once they start introducing the other characters is when things get fun. Dropping before everyone is on stage is a bad decision. Especially considering this is a 73 episode anime.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
Every week when I watched this show I would always flail when it was over because I wanted there to be more so badly! (I still do!) I get really into the personal battles the characters are involved in, and I really want to know more about their world! There&#039;s so much we don&#039;t know yet, and so much to explore. I want Osamu to grow and become strong so he can catch up to his team mates, and I want Yuuma to solve the mysteries around his father he&#039;s been searching for, and I want Chika to find her lost friends and family! Without going into much detail about all of these plot-lines, I want to say it really is worth continuing to watch this show and not give up on it. Think of how slow Hunter x Hunter was at first, or Fairy Tail. This is similar but with more sci-fi leanings. Like a more simple/iconic styled Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (♥).<br />
<br />
<br />
10/10!<br />
<br />
Big things to keep in mind before watching:<br />
• This show has 73 episodes, the plot will not all be apparent in the first handful of episodes. Give it at least 15 or so episodes, AT LEAST.<br />
• Don&#039;t pre-judge the animation. Remember lots of other famous, good anime has unique styles of animation. (Fairy Tail, JoJo, Nanatsu no Taizai, Kingdom, Gash Bell etc) and all of those were worth getting over it.<br />
• The credits and OP/ED format is a little different, the recap at first seems annoying now but it will be convenient later on because it has 73 episodes and it can be hard to find where you&#039;re leaving off without it. Just try to get used to the OP happening after the initial beginning part of the show. Like most TV drama shows that start off in the plot. It&#039;s not that big of a deal and doesn&#039;t influence how much show you see.<br />
• Just be open to giving it a chance!

    This is it boys and girls, I&#039;m bringing you another anime review that you all been waiting for (No one did).<br />
<br />
What is it with this anime, at some points it impresses me and makes me think that I found something good, but then you turn around the corner and you get punched in the face.<br />
How creators were able to balance garbage and awesome in a same anime amazes me. Even if I gave this one 5, I know easy fix how to make it to at least 7. I leave it somewhere at the end of review.<br />
 Not because I want you to read all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review221836">
        review or anything B-Ba-Baka! This review may contain some minor spoilers, so please consult with your doctor before reading this, everything is done by professionals with supervision, please do not try this at home.<br />
<br />
So this anime has a plot, and it&#039;s not bad really. Building fantasy world little by little, and oh boys when I say little by little I mean it. It&#039;s SLOW man! Before it get to some good parts another anime could already ended. But when it gets to those points it&#039;s pretty good, I like systems where you get your characters ranked by how awesome they are. And massive wars<br />
that involves a lot of characters. There are a lot of strategy involved in battles, and I love that. I think that is the best part of this anime.<br />
 If you like battles, you should check this one out. But that only happens when humans are fighting against humans, surroundings get so alive, everything happening for a reason and at the same time, really great stuff.<br />
<br />
Now let&#039;s have some fun, lets talk about stuff that makes you hate your self for wasting time watching this anime. Characters... oh boy... Who was the smart one to make main character guy with glasses I have nothing against people who wear gasses, but come one, this is anime. Every time I watch character with glasses, its most boring, useless person on that anime, whats up with that. Some guy though that  it would be fun to put his little son Timmie in to the anime. Because everybody loves to watch average person living average life in f***ing fantasy worlds. He&#039;s weak, cant do anything alone, and will try to save everybody even if it cost his life. Sometimes looks like he is trying to kill him self, because he knows how boring he is. If I want to see something like that, I would go outside, and there is no fantasy involved there.<br />
Then we have Chika, what is wrong with her head? Cmon people, look at it, LOOK AT IT! I would want to know her back story of her head more, that main story. As a character she&#039;s horrible, feels like she should have glasses<br />
but there can only be one useless character with glasses. Thank god, that other characters are decent or even good. Like Jin or Kuga. And there are so many characters, that they run out of ideas how to make them difference<br />
so few of them I could not even tell apart.<br />
<br />
But you want to know what really killed this anime? Do you? Are you sure? Okay then...<br />
Fugitive arc. WTF was that? It look like different anime with same characters. Well Chika&#039;s head got smaller, so that&#039;s good, still looked retarded.. (I swear I could draw her face better)<br />
World trigger meeting:<br />
Boss:-okay guys, we have build pretty good world with a lot of possibilities, everything is stable, interesting and makes you want to see what happens next. What should we do next?<br />
Weebmaster3000:-I know just a thing. So you know all that world? Lets trow everything away, introduce few new boring characters and focus anime only on them. Lets put filler episodes in a filler arc. Do some beach, shopping<br />
and random episodes where gag relief side character gets trips with no purpose. And don&#039;t try to make any sense with plot, just make it random, it&#039;s fun. Trust me on this.<br />
Boss:- well okay then, lets do this! LEEROY JENKINS!!!!<br />
This arc was an abomination, it gives NOTHING to main plot and makes no sense at all, so stupid, so random, so useless.<br />
 I bet weebmaster3000 was that smarta**, to place every opening in the middle of episode.It&#039;s like:<br />
Oh I see you are enjoying this episode, just let me stop that for you and show you our opening, because maybe you forgot what you are watching, don&#039;t worry no need to thank me.<br />
<br />
So in the end what to do with this anime? You can make it good on your on. You have the POWER! Skip fugitive arc. Episode 48-63. Believe me, it got NOTHING worth watching. And if you skip it, you will improve this anime dramatically.<br />
Just need to find a way how to kill Osamu and Chika then it would be perfect. <br />
<br />
In short: Got nothing to watch? Looking for something new in anime? Watch it, but skip fugitive arc.<br />
Hate boring characters and slow pace? Have something better to do? Don&#039;t watch it.

    I decided to try and watch World Trigger. So, what went wrong?<br />
<br />
When watching any given medium of storytelling, there’s usually some consistent points I look out for to help me evaluate whether I like it or not. <br />
<br />
Are the main character’s interesting, do they have goals? Are they conflicted, challenged in some way?<br />
<br />
Is the story interesting? Is it unique, or is it a uniquely adapted genre? Does it have depth, or substance? Does it inspire me to continue watching by virtue of its own merit as a story?<br />
<br />
And lastly, is there tension?<br />
<br />
This show has none of these things. <br />
<br />
Its characters lack specific goals, and for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review375419">
        what goals they do have, there’s no tension behind them to give me the viewer a sense of rising urgency. The story is very generic, lacking any outstanding sense of originality from its anime peers. And most of all, a point I normally don’t hold to too high a merit, its animation is woefully lacklustre. In fact, that was my last straw. On episode fourteen, I was watching an incredibly boring battle, in an anime that is practically designed to show off combat, and it felt cheap. The studio behind it, for some reason, had decided not to adapt the first real human to human combat scene with any remarkable effort. Maybe they’re saving they’re budget? I don’t know, and I’ll never find out. Hunter x Hunter ran for over one hundred episodes and never looked so drab and uninspired as the battles shown up till that episode. <br />
<br />
The enemies are dull, the combat is unremarkable, the characters lack meaningful objectives, and the world is incredibly generic.   <br />
<br />
World Trigger inspires no one.  <br />

    Although many disagree, I persoanlly liked World Trigger. I read the manga first, so watching the anime was completely painful. Don&#039;t know how Toei managed to pull in Yuki Kaji for Osamu, but this was one of the things that made me stick with it. The lack-luster animation, random, long, pauses, and dragged out episodes with ridiculously long recaps was a bit dissapointing and turned away a lot of viewers.<br />
<br />
 I really liked Kuga&#039;s character, his design and backstory, but many others like Osamu and Chika were half baked as charaters. I totally see where the author was going with this story having a character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219493">
        like Osamu as one of the main characters and although it will probably be better in the end, people didn&#039;t want their time wasted. The seiyuus weren&#039;t bad, and honestly, although Osamu isn&#039;t the character that Yuki Kaji is used to voicing, it made Osamu a bit more likeable. This anime has lots of flaws but lots of good things with it. Read the manga tbh<br />

    I don&#039;t understand the really positive reviews.  This was NOT a good anime.  The premise was a great premise, but the show have a few major flaws throughout.  <br />
<br />
1) World logic was not consistent.  The show would introduce world logic for some component, and they would then forget about it or even contradict it in later episodes.  They were usually minor things, but this was frequent enough to really question the story flow.  Stuff like how an entire faction despises all neighbors and wants to kill them to the writers forgetting about what motivates this faction by the end

          <span style="display: none;" id="review369937">
        and it just being overlooked.  Things like how &quot;points&quot; are relevant for a few episodes...and then they aren&#039;t.  The fact that the head of Border effectively starts a coo, and everyone is okay with it.  One guy can see the short future, but can also see the future years in advance to almost pinpoint accuracy...and he is then portrayed as some sort of high-level counselor to the head of the border?  Etc etc etc...the list of these items are endless.  <br />
2) Characters were relatively vapid with some of the protagonists kind of being annoying to deal with.  The world seems to be fascinated Osamu, who is a protagonist and &quot;captain&quot; of the protagonist team.  He is a very weak and melodramatic character whose only exceptional talent seems to be occasionally coming up with something witty, being uncharacteristically brave for someone who is so timid, being incredibly altruistic to the point where you kind of want to barf and always being overshadowed by everyone else around him.  Yet, for no reason given, this &quot;bravery&quot; or &quot;tenacity&quot; (blind luck usually) gets him the attention and sponsorship of everyone... WHAT A BAD PROTAGONIST!<br />
3) Every episode has a few minutes going over what has happened in previous episodes.  This is just a waste of time... it also adds to the feeling that the anime presents where they are trying to just run the clock and waste time without providing too many filler episodes. <br />
4) Some of the editing is poor in the beginning with awkwardly long still frames of a moment as it has ended.  This gets resolved later on in the anime, but it makes the anime seem amateurish<br />
5) Story premise is fantastic!  It is unique and fun...yet they took a great story premise and filled it with poor to amateurish writing which really diluded the show.  Some characters don&#039;t even need to exist!  There are also TONS of times where deus ex machina is introduced and someone appears out of thin blue, surprising everyone and saving the day.  One scene has a helicopter appear out in the middle of the sea surprising everyone when someone shoots down a ladder...???  Are you trying to say that there just HAPPENED to be a comrade in a helicopter that NO ONE NOTICED in the middle of the sea that flies right next to the characters as they need to be saved???  Alot of poor writing like this is rife throughout the anime.  <br />
6) Artwork is meh...its not terrible, but its not anything to rant about.  I do enjoy some of the character designs and flow, though there are also times where the artwork designs don&#039;t seem to mesh well.<br />
7) Tied in with the world logic, for a story that seems to center on comradery and appeasing a surprisingly privileged civilian base, people seem relatively apathetic towards death.  There are times when some damage is done in a city due to Neighbor attacks, or even some Border soldiers are kidnapped and the public loses their minds and start blaming Border for things that are not possibly in their realm of control.  But when tons of people die, no one seems to bat an eye?  <br />
<br />
The list for these things goes on, but there are simply better animes out there to watch.  They took a good premise for an anime and filled it with mediocre filler.  A few episodes are entertaining until you need to rush through a few more to get to that next entertaining episode.  Is it worth the watch?  ...Meh...I suppose it is, though you&#039;ll probably want to skip a lot of episodes or entire swathes of sections in episodes that are just boring.  Every relationship and character is so weak that the only really entertaining parts are sometimes the fighting, and even then, it becomes redundant, annoying at times, spread out too thin across multiple episodes and should only be a facet of an anime, not the only entertaining thing about it.

    Every so often I&#039;ll take a look at an Anime compilation video. It just so happened I found out about World Trigger that way. I think it was one of those &quot;Best fights of the 2010s&quot; type things. I&#039;d be lying if I said I remembered which fight from the show was featured but the important thing is that I found this Anime.<br />
<br />
I was expecting a more usual 24ish episodes so it was to my surprise when I saw it was 73. This like some of the other longer Shounen out there start off kinda slow with the introductions of people and plot and whatnot

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336485">
        but am I glad I sat through it. I was definitely surprised at the overall result and I&#039;m super glad I stumbled upon this show.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure this isnt the first Shounen that had aliens as the antagonists but I really enjoyed how everything was presented to the viewer and carried out. It all seemed to be going at a nice pace (Aside from those few episodes where half the episode was a recap of the last one or two episodes and then the second half was advancement. That happened more in the latter part of the show.<br />
<br />
I liked the fact that even though the cast is pretty big and it is very obvious who the story is centered on a lot of people get a little screen time and get to have their own impact in their own ways. I feel you could really tell that it was a big organization filled with many different type of people with their own views and goals when it came to advancement and competition within Border but when it was time to get serious each of them would come together for the most part and handle serious business as needed to keep the citizens safe. <br />
<br />
It might seem a little crazy but ever since I started my Anime watching I haven&#039;t come across many long Shounen that actually take time to build their supporting cast even a little bit. World Trigger reminds me of Yuu Yuu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter and it was real nice. The only thing that started to bug me was the speed at which Mikumo is developing. This is mainly because he tried to do things that were above his level and he wasn&#039;t going to be able to absorb and learn from. Thankfully toward the end of things there were some nice steps taken and for me it felt like he made a nice amount of overall progress.<br />
<br />
When I first started this adventure I wasn&#039;t expecting much, just a little time sync where I could get my fighting fix. Little did I know I was about to get hooked into another one of the Hunter x Hunter, Hajime No Ippo types. I recommend this to almost anyone who likes Shounen and those wanting to take a first dive into Shounen coming from Sci-Fi  will have a relatively easy transition.

    I don&#039;t understand why this anime is si underrated. Many said that you need to watch a few episodes to get hooked up in this anime. Well, I loved this anime from the start!<br />
<br />
Slight spoiler alert!!<br />
<br />
I am quite pissed at how the main character guy, Mikumo never seem to get stronger. I mean like he is smart, but thats it, he doesn&#039;t show any takent and is portrayed as the kind of guy who seems to attract a lot of strong people around him, despite not having any fighting skill at all. But I guess this is one way to develop the plot. Plus they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222578">
        add in Kuga as the main character which I absolutely love! <br />
<br />
Some people seems to be complaining about the art made by Toei. Well, I have to disagree. I mean like I have seen better arts, but you can&#039;t really complain about the quality of the art used here. <br />
<br />
I started reading the manga after watching the anime. I have to say, they follow the plot of manga quite well. I practically can just start reading the manga from the middle because the anime and manga connects so well!<br />
<br />
Well overall I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I binge watched this in 3 days and enjoyed every moment of it. I highly recommend this anime! Looking forward to the next season!

    You will find that this is a very underrated anime series if you read any other review of it and it&#039;s damn true.I will keep it real short and convenient(a little long actually).<br />
This is really one of those well crafted shounen anime that is not cliche...well......not that it is completely new(not that you get any fully original series nowadays)....but it really goes in a direction something more realistic and more believable. Completely different from middle-school kids levelling up and saving god knows how many worlds.<br />
For me the story and the concept of the power(trion) was better than that of chakra, nen, or magic. I personally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review239885">
        loved it a lot. The characters were amazing.....they were fucking badass......you will find no annoying characters and almost love every one of the cast. I could also say that BORDER is one of the most fucking badass organization in all of anime history. And the most interesting thing is that our MC is literally the weakest character in the series.....and despite that you will not hate it....can you imagine how amazing that is. He is not an idiot like most of them are...you will never hear monolouges of shounen protagonist and cannot expect what they will do....but here at least you can know what he is thinking. He knows he is the weakest and does things based on what he can and should do. The other MC&#039;s are like the baddest of the badasses......I can only say you are gonna love them.<br />
The only sad thing is that the ending is abrupt. It&#039;s because the anime caught up too fast with the manga that they had no more material to continue the story. But I am waiting patiently for it&#039;s next season and I hope we will in the same boat.

    So found out that world trigger was completed then i started to watch it and frankly for someone who likes these types of anime this anime both triggered and dissapointed me big time. Why almost everyone think this is great praising it like the next coming well no its not. <br />
<br />
The story is the same as most anime there you have scifi combined with superlike human weapons or abilities. Good guys fight back while bad guys keep invading. This is fine i kinda expected it and its not something i would rate an anime bad for. The only  problem is that type of story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review232658">
        makes it easy to guess different plots in it. When i see something happening and think to myself ah so it was going to happen like that, then i know something just normal will be with this anime. The triggers is what make this anime what it is it gives the anime the only  thing to make it unique. What type of triggers does he use what is the difference between each things like that is of interest because thats what this anime is about combined with the alien attack. But this anime pisses me of because i feel like they just say hey lets make this happen while another part says hey lets stop this doesnt feel good lets make something else happen instead. And when they finally get to explain things they create a big event and its basically and now after the invation break. I can watch slow animes i even love those but thats when they actually try to get some sort of picture through or explain not when you just throw a bunch of fights there you just get more and more distraught. <br />
<br />
I will give this anime that it has openings that you can enjoy eventhough they try to make the anime unique by plopping the openings in the middle of the episode. The openings are interesting there is that. <br />
<br />
Never have i  found myself hate as many characters as i did in this anime never. I was at the 10 episode when i thought should i just toss it aside but no my anime sence told me that there was something i would enjoy. The characters was not any of this. The main character is piss poor weak he cant fight for shit he cant even do dmg whats so great about this. He gets helped almost always and it feels like the only thing he can do is acting like a meat shield or run away as a distraction. The main supporting girl Chika basically gave alot of the story away when i heard about her more clearly which is why i wont spoil it but its obvious. The supporting guy Yuma is your typical op supporting character who helps the main character Osuma a bunch of times hes likable enough but has his weird yet kind side. There are a few other characters i could like but too many gave me that feeling of annoyance and wanted to throw off a cliff<br />
<br />
I started to enjoy this anime when i got to about episode 40 surprise ? well you shouldnt be. I had to fight my way through episodes there i wonder is there any point in this anime having a Mc. My advice for whoever reads this is to not care about main character and just view everything as a story of its own and never think of any character as a main just think of them as part of a divition or similar to that or you will run the risk of being burned. <br />
<br />
Overall there is nothing special about this anime that i could say i enjoyed all the way through i can only say that it had its good moment but thats it. The story and the consept of the triggers was great but in the end i could find an anime like this and find a better one easly. If i ever watch this one again it will be from around episode 40 or so maybe 38 but not much back than that. <br />

    This anime is more than I&#039;ve ever expected. From the mediocre reviews this anime got, i only picked it up because i was bored. But it turned out to be the best decision of my life. <br />
<br />
From the mind-blowing action packed fight sequences to the exciting tactical team play. i was left astounded.<br />
However, the fight scenes are just the icing on the cake. What lies within is a wholesome story that justifies the purpose of each character&#039;s actions adding more depth and layer making this a delicious adventure for anyone to dig in. <br />
<br />
The only set back for this is the Fugitive arc( Anime only)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228907">
        which really took the momentum off the anime. <br />
<br />
All in All, i throughly enjoyed this anime is left craving for more.

    I&#039;ll keep it short, the show has a very interesting world, its a blast to follow the main characters and all the frequent side characters, and you have to adore Raijinmaru.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Out of the 70+ episodes, maybe a solid 30 full episodes could be filled with the recaps, and unnecessary prolonged scenes that only give off the feeling of being put in to delay time. The most striking example of this is in the early episodes when you have a individual prolonged zoom on all the directors of Border with stern faces.<br />
<br />
The show gets better with time though.

    People judge this series way too quickly. I&#039;ve seen comments of people hating after watching 2 or 3 episodes just because of artwork. It&#039;s not that bad and the actual anime is great. This is a great anime, people who judge an anime by its looks that harshly when it&#039;s not even that bad seriously need to reconsider what they think is good and also whether they can be a real &#039;fan&#039; of any series. Just go watch the entire thing, it&#039;s a great series 100% worth watching. The fights are great, development not too fast, overall the anime is well-thought out and a joy

    It&#039;s a Shounen with the key difference that the lead protagonist is weak and isn&#039;t special/chosen. There also isn&#039;t as much anime goofiness as most shounen. <br />
<br />
The series follows typical shounen tropes: a growing rolodex of side characters; an invasion arc; a battle arc; a world with a power/strength hierarchy; expanding lore etc. <br />
<br />
Although the main character shows potential with tactics, he relies on others to get through battles. In typical shounen fashion, characters bond and support him due to his tenacity and moral compass.<br />
 <br />
There isn&#039;t much in the way of melodramatic feels. No grand moments that make you jump out of your chair.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review380942">
        But it moves along at a good pace, the story is engaging, and the characters feel consistent and well rounded. <br />
<br />
The exception is the rather large filler arc, which was a chore to watch. I struggled through it without knowing it was filler.<br />
<br />
The art is a struggle at first, and though it slightly improves (mainly background art), you do get used to it after a few episodes.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of characters and some of the side ones are drawn quite similarly, so it can get confusing who is who.
