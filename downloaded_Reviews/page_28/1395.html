    “Who.. are you?”<br />
“Haven’t you heard? I’m Sakamoto.”<br />
<br />
You’d almost wish it started out like this, there’s that perpetual gnawing going on in the obscured depths of your conscience that bugs you for some normality, some profound simplicity in going about an anime you might never have even heard of. This auxiliary introduction to this mysterious, clean-looking man, unfortunately, doesn’t exist. <br />
<br />
Why, of course, would there be such a need?<br />
One does not introduce Sakamoto.<br />
One does not simply require the induction of any mainstream preface to unveil such a magnificent being.<br />
It is without question, almost as splendidly visceral as how the gleam in his eyes decimates the wobbly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222687">
        heart of every female and non-asshole male in his vicinity, for everyone to instantly fathom that this man right here, Sakamoto, superabounds over what it takes to be the chef d&#039;oeuvre of all characters, a resounding existence amongst those who don’t exist, in an even more resounding, deafness-impelling, heaven-shattering pièce de résistance that goes by the splendid title: Sakamoto desu-ga?<br />
<br />
It’s quite simple, especially for a thoughtful Solomon who would scrutinize and deeply consider the 2nd last, 6th and 6th last letter of every title of every anime before concluding on a score, to assign Sakamoto desu-ga an objective semblance of pure perfection. While the masses do revere icons and symbols of divinity, others of heuristic agnosticism, few can appreciate the enrapturing coalescence of the two. Such is the misappropriation of the essence and cachet withheld by some for Sakamoto desu-ga. Allow me to hereby inscribe the holy scripture of seraphic diagnosis with respect to Sakamoto, and why any of this information should be not be reprised. <br />
<br />
i) Story - Simple, yet revolutionary<br />
Consign GTO’s Onizuka Eikichi and his biker-educational-reformation to oblivion. It’s a simple explanation in real life, really: Panty and Male equals to, well, Jail. Forget One Punch Man’s Saitama just like how everyone he’s saved belittles his bald existence. You’d be fighting incredulous monsters every second and be damned to well, a bald existence. <br />
This story’s premise doesn’t stink with excessive quixotical nihilism, or a spectrally-antithetical cosmic flamboyance, nor is it ostentatious in budget-cramped explosions or drenched in senseless sexual innuendo. <br />
Instead, this story presents that of one we have all experienced, through sweat and tears, through journeying a school life so mundane and arduous, through all those lonely and embarrassing moments, and to this day we still ponder what had ruined it all. That’s right, the omission of a Sakamoto in our lives. Someone, who epitomizes vigor, strength and intellect, that inspires and unbounds the coolness deep within our own individuality. With the absence of such a character, our stories were tasteless, and this story, just like ours had been, would be so too, with a convolution of archetypical dense leads as dense as lead, busty brainless “supports”, conventional franchise-driven, product-advertising, cash-grabbing studios dragging sideways an unrealistic rendition of what COULD have happened in our youths, hence pandering to the lowest, albeit commonly sought-after pubescent demographic. Lay everything bare with your eyes, and you’ll see how all this dirt and grime have long since insidiously buried the savior to all this banality, the deity and student of class 1-2, Sakamoto, and how HE truly deserves to lead us back to a path of greatness that anime has long since been led astray.<br />
This story, is how it all begins. <br />
<br />
ii) Characters - Sheer, harmonic opulence<br />
Why have characters when there are no characters at all? With the respectable, sensible judgment upheld by numerous veteran critics, the characters of animes in vogue are plethorically referred to as “cardboard cutouts”, “lifeless”, “fictitious”, “not-Sakamoto”. There are no supporting characters in Sakamoto desu-ga, simply because Sakamoto himself supports everyone else. He never imposes; he does not instruct; he only exemplifies the genuity of coolness, and he blows both the animated plebeians and you away with way more than whatever renewed apocalyptic jutsus in Naruto Shippuden are ever canonically capable of achieving. Sakamoto need not amateurish fillers, what for? He is filled to the brim with untainted swag, and instead of receiving fillers he fills everything around him with nothing but the truth. Critics lament and exhort producers and animators to fix their messed-up characters. Well then, Sakamoto’s very much heard enough, so he fixes his own goddamn characters, he gives the very meaning to life as it should be, it’s the raison d&#039;être of his existence. What else, then, are the characters in Sakamoto desu-ga but an ethereal assemblage of life itself, with all its beauty and flaws intact?<br />
<br />
iii) Production - A team of legends<br />
Animation: Studio Deen<br />
The beginning of Sakamoto heralds what will be known as the timely Olympian peroration of Deen-animation jokes. “Deenimation” budget might have once been a joke. However, this very production itself, is factually no joke. Sakamoto visualized in motion picture spells an unequivocal merchandisable disaster for financially acclaimed studios such as Madhouse and ufotable; Sakamoto’s rendition is simply too gorgeous, invoking too paradisiac an animation quality requirement for even the likes of so-called Unlimited Budget Works to sustain. Before Unlimited Sakamoto Works, everything else’s reduced to a marginal and pathetic joke. <br />
<br />
Director: Shinji Takamasu<br />
Superseding School Rumble, Gintama and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, comes a man of wit almost as cool as Sakamoto himself. One can only admire his wisecracking craft as much as Sakamoto desu-ga is to be admired for its gag-propitiated comicality. Accordingly, I place utmost value on discerning the first, third last, seventh, fifth last and fourth letter of the names of every director before contrasting it to the former analysis of the very title of that anime. Naturally, you can barely even perceive how powerful this matchup is; what else, would Sakamoto be deserving of if not the best?<br />
<br />
Voice Acting: Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto<br />
Heck, you might have watched Gintama, some Great Teacher Onizuka, maybe Code Geass, perhaps Angel Beats, or Fate/Zero, with an off-chance of Mononoke, and this guy’s been in all of them and more. You’ve probably never even heard of him, he’s never been in the spotlight, but now that “supporting role” entirety is gonna change. As Sakamoto himself, he holds nothing less than the God’s Tongue and the voice of heaven, auralizing an indescribably lustrous overtone that defines perfection. What more can you ask for? Beethoven? That&#039;s on appallingly divergent levels. Sakamoto’s voice entails the ascension of every composed and uncomposed orchestral symphonic masterpiece to date. Right here, it’s Sakamoto Flows In You. Beethoven, on the other hand, has long since been decomposing. <br />
<br />
Opening/Ending Songs by Customi Z and Suneohair:<br />
22 times. That’s the total number of different stances that Sakamoto has stylishly taken in the opening sequence, COOLEST. It’s almost as if the song was made just for Sakamoto. Can you believe that? Simply amazing.  <br />
<br />
Unabridged and sporting a melancholic transience, Suneohair’s exemplar of an ending song is contemporary to that of an angel’s hymn. With luster and class, Sakamoto is splashed with an aural paint of sublimity in an everlasting interlude between his work days of delivering more COOL to the mortal realm and heightening levels of SPECIAL in the progression of civilization. In the lateness of day, even the sun begins to shy away from overexposure to Sakamoto’s dignified existence. It is thanks to this hymn in great taste, that we can observe Sakamoto in his natural habitat, partaking in elegant recreation alongside a beauteous sunset. <br />
<br />
iv) Ultimatum<br />
Should you watch Sakamoto desu-ga?<br />
I am afraid I would have to say no. <br />
It is beyond tangible excruciation for me at this point of writing to even delineate the consequences of watching the first episode of Sakamoto desu-ga, which include: <br />
1)	Sentience<br />
2)	Admiration<br />
3)	Killer moves<br />
4)	Another reason to watch Sakamoto<br />
5)	Macrocosmic indulgence<br />
6)	Obstruction of negativity<br />
7)	Titular charisma<br />
8)	Over-the-top greatness<br />
Very much 8 tragic mortal weaknesses, withal the 8 tenacious symptoms of perfection. <br />
Should you be slightly confused or bewildered at this point, I greatly sympathize with the below philosophical postulation:<br />
<br />
“Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he has created here on Earth?”<br />
-Robert Rodriguez<br />
<br />
Sakamoto however, parades the mortal realm with no fear of himself. <br />
Undoubtedly, you should fear and stray away from such an absurdly brilliant creation. You should fear perfection, when perfection perfectly clones itself and stares at it like it’s nothing.<br />
<br />
Unless, you, are different?<br />
Might you have actually embraced the abstraction altogether, pieced en masse the very construct of valuation and grasped perfection since the start, from the very first moment?<br />
No, how could this be?? <br />
Who.. are you?<br />
-<br />
~<br />
Haven&#039;t you heard? I&#039;m Sakamoto<br />

    &quot;Every man wants to be like him and women named their vibrators after him&quot;<br />
<br />
In a world riddled with cringe humor, Sakamoto Desuga? is here to bless us with an alternative, yet rarely utilized type of comedy; <br />
Suave humor. Known also by it&#039;s street name &quot;Swag humor&quot; this sort of comedy depicts the complete opposite of social awkwardness where the main character is the embodiment of social perfection.<br />
<br />
The show is completely contrarian in nature. Perfect characters are often frown upon but now and then, someone would find someway to challenge such sentiments. Sakamoto, the complete opposite of a certain popular cringe character named Bean (even with

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218083">
        a slightly elevated mole position), revolves around the story. I mean the story revolves around Sakamoto and his interaction with daily life and the people whom just so happened to be sharing the world with him. <br />
<br />
Due to his character already being flawless in nature, the show&#039;s premise relies on the development of other character that directly interacts with him. Almost every episodic segment promotes an obvious &quot;moral of the story&quot;, Sakamoto &quot;kakoi-ness&quot; inspires his fellow students to strive to be better, in somewhat roundabout comedic way. <br />
<br />
The opening song of the anime serves as a fitting &quot;bard&#039;s song&quot; singing heroic praises, commemorating Sakamoto&#039;s existence. The jazzy tune played at every instance of &quot;Sugoi-ness&quot; amplifies Sakamoto&#039;s position as a cult of personality in his own show. I sincerely wished there were more varieties for this composition (musical instrument wise) otherwise I would have given it a &quot;Sakamoto&quot; rating (That&#039;s a perfect score). <br />
<br />
A major risk with the show&#039;s premise is that it constantly needs to redefine it&#039;s &quot;Kuru-ness&quot; as it needs to persistently impress viewers so that the humor does not run dry. Being constantly bombarded by his &quot;sugoi&quot; antics, viewers may sense a feeling of repetition and familiarness. Thus, an unimpressive side character was eventually introduced as Sakamoto&#039;s comrade in order the contrast the blatant difference between them. The show is capable of inducing a few chuckles here and there but it&#039;s short of being anything revolutionary. Whether you are impressed or just find his roundabout ways amusing, Sakamoto does capture our imagination of an almost perfect human being (Clearly because he has to wear glasses, his eyesight isn&#039;t that perfect).<br />
<br />
PS: Apologies for all the wapanese terms, just an afterthought of how cringey it is when non-Japanese speakers use Japanese word but it is somewhat &quot;cool&quot; for Japanese people to use English terms. Such is life. But not for Sakamoto.. Stay Cool Kids. Don&#039;t do Anime, not even once. <br />

    Well, this is a different approach of the 3 episodes rule. If you watched the first 3 episodes, whether you liked it or not, you&#039;ve seen everything the show can offer.<br />
<br />
There is no story, no characters, just Sakamoto swagging around, overcomes his opponents effortlessly. It becomes repetitive and boring real quick. There are some minor plot twists in every one or two episodes, when you along the rest of the cast thinks Sakamoto doing something extraordinary, but it turns out, it&#039;s just a regular thing, like making noise or hail a taxi. It&#039;s creative and funny, at least the first 2 or 3 times, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222601">
        not enough. The sound and music are decent, fits to the series, but that&#039;s all. There is literally nothing to talk about this series because it&#039;s completely blank.<br />
<br />
At the end the biggest flaw of the series is that how flawless the main character is. There is no excitement, no tension and the blunt jokes couldn&#039;t keep up my attention. It&#039;s bad show and a boring which is one a mistake a comedy series can not afford to make.

    Long before my life on this earth began, my family&#039;s lineage has been devoted to studying and teaching the ancient manuscript of Swag: a primordial order committed to deciphering the body&#039;s hidden aura, in an attempt to understand what makes some people &quot;Da COOLEST.&quot; As per custom, this responsibility is passed on to the next of kin, and in order to uphold this age-old tradition, my long rigorous undertaking of Swag began.<br />
Through the deepest depths of the Amazon rainforest and the scorching heat of the Sahara desert, I traversed the lands in search of answers. Learning the forbidden tapestry of the Maasai tribe, as well

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222657">
        as dedicating 5 years of discipleship to the Caribs and Arawaks natives of Trinidad, I&#039;ve gathered up enough information through extensive research and careful analysis to finally end this ancestral task. And so, after much deliberation, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that Sakamoto is, without dispute, the swaggiest character in all the land.<br />
<br />
SWAGMOTO (often misspelled as &quot;Sakamoto desu ga?&quot;) or &quot;Haven&#039;t You Heard? I&#039;m Sakamoto&quot; in English, is the story of a Gary Stu maneuvering his way through high school, as he deals with the everyday pressures of growing up, as well as the burden that comes with having an excessive amount of swag and being absolutely fabulous. <br />
With no one else to turn to, Swagmoto is forced to carry this heavy burden of &quot;COOL&quot; all by his lonesome, constantly being pestered into appeasing lesser beings by humoring or aiding them in their daily dilemmas. He&#039;s a God among men, our Lord and savior sent from the heavens to guide the uncultured plebeians. And when he isn&#039;t indirectly seducing men, women and grown-ups alike, Swagmoto is teaching his fellow man life lessons in absurd ways that only a true SwagLord of his caliber is capable of doing. <br />
<br />
Sakamoto is what happens when you take an observational approach to an overused trope, while also deciding to view it through a comedic lens. And in this case, the overused trope being examined is Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters. With portrayals that often border on the implausible due to the nature of these type of characters being flawless, Sakamoto purposely pushes pass the already thin threshold of practicality associated with them, to enter a realm beyond logic or reason. It exaggerates an archetype that&#039;s already exaggerated, to begin with, resulting in what would usually be seen as idealistic features and feats in any other show, into laughter inducing comedic mishaps. <br />
<br />
Any given episode sees the titular SwagLord modestly demonstrating his unparalleled COOLNESS in daily tasks at school and around his town, while also occasionally introducing other opposing characters that try to dethrone his position as the swaggiest character on campus. These naysayers often try desperately to outdo SwagJesus in some kind of task, only to have their plans backfire in their faces when his swag is proven to be 2COOL4them. And like everyone else that comes face to face with Swagdaddy, they too are assimilated into the fold as one of his disciples, admiring his fabulousness from afar, while desperately seeking out his attention and approval. <br />
<br />
The story structure of Sakamoto is similar to that of comedies like Cromartie High School, but where that over-exaggerates the actions of high school delinquents, Sakamoto switches its focus to idealized characters. And while it should go without saying that comedy is highly subjective, it&#039;s still safe to say that if you like comedic stories with this kind of structure, then there&#039;s a good chance that you would find Sakamoto&#039;s offerings to be up to snuff. The protagonist&#039;s deadpan delivery, coupled with the range of reactions given by his peers, is the selling point of the show. But with no other offerings besides this joke, it doesn&#039;t take long for the misadventures of Swagmoto to border on lackluster. Like any other gag comedy with a central gimmick carrying it, there will come a point where the punchline doesn&#039;t hit as hard as it did before, and Sakamoto wasn&#039;t immune to this occurrence. <br />
<br />
A joke that&#039;s become par for the course runs the risk of growing dull. You could always spice it up with different scenarios, but when the core reasoning behind the joke remains the same, it ceases to deliver the same results after some time. This is usually why most comedy shows have something other than its signature style of humor to keep the viewer&#039;s attentiveness. With a limited repertoire of comedic quips and material to worth with, Sakamoto often found its level of impact fluctuating on regular intervals. And while the scenarios are different, the jokes all center around the same comedic gag, which of course is Sakamoto&#039;s unnervingly perfect execution of everything he does. <br />
But even when the show doesn&#039;t bring the laughs, you could still depend on Swagmoto to swoop in and save the day. If it doesn&#039;t hit its target on the first try, there&#039;s usually a follow-up attempt that does. This doesn&#039;t mean that our messiah was always successful at salvaging a dying joke, but his efforts did keep the show from becoming a chore to watch. With Jesus on your side, anything is possible. Even a measly comedic attempt is still capable of making you smile when Swagmoto is behind it. The Lord is truly great and worthy to be praised. <br />
<br />
Another key feature of Sakamoto&#039;s sense of humor is just how upfront it is. It never feels mean-spirited about how it goes about masquerading any of these characters. Even when accounting for the fact that these type of characters presented are usually taken in a negative light. Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters are often detested by viewers, and rightfully so. Their presence usually indicates a sign of cheap writing on the creator&#039;s behalf. So when Sakamoto views this detracting feature as a glass half full, it opens up an avenue for a new look on the subject.  <br />
<br />
Even when Swagmoto appears to be giving someone the cold shoulder, in reality, he still has their best interest in mind. As stated by fellow reviewer RogerSmith2004, &quot;Even when the other person loses, they never actually lose. Their encounter with Sakamoto is always a beneficial one. By the end of the segment, no matter how crazy it may seem... Sakamoto, through some means, helps them out.&quot; The lighthearted nature of Sakamoto gave the show a feel-good quality about it. It was ever-pleasant and always endearing, making it one of my favorite entries from 2016&#039;s Spring season.   <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
Because of the potency of his swag, many often found themselves enraptured by SwagLord&#039;s presence. I found myself being one of those people. Just the memes and inside jokes the show generated around it kept me entertained. I couldn&#039;t scroll through a Sakamoto comment section without busting out in a fit of laughter. This saying nothing about the show itself, which constantly had me tearing up with just how funny it was. While the only progression that happened was him winning over the characters introduced one by one, I was never bored by it. No, the jokes weren&#039;t always as funny. No, it isn&#039;t going to be funny for everyone. But for my personal experience, Sakamoto was a title I looked forward to every week. <br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
<br />
While the run-on joke didn&#039;t always remain fresh, there was certainly enough moments of comedic brilliance that kept the show afloat. As you would expect, it didn&#039;t take long before the shortcomings of basing an entire show around a Gary Stu to quickly become apparent. Even with that being said, it doesn&#039;t take away the moments when the show delivered a comedic home run. Had it been given a longer run-time, it would have inevitably crumbled under its own weight. Sakamoto was a novelty act that narrowly avoided mediocrity status, thanks to the antics of the titular character. Every time I thought the show finally ran its course, it was immediately saved by Swagmoto and some new absurd life lesson. And honestly, how could I not love SwagLord? He made me a believer. PRAISE HIM, PRAISE SWAGJESUS! And for those readers that haven&#039;t experience the bountiful blessings of our Lord and savior, I implore you to seek him out, for he is worthy to be praise. Amen. <br />

    Sometimes, A show comes along with one Character who can do Everything Right and thus is perfect an all Categories.<br />
That kind of Character is what most ppl Including me Call an &quot;Gary Stu&quot; if the character is a male character or &quot;Mary Sue&quot; if the character is a Female.<br />
These Characters however for me more often Transform into Characters who are so poorly written that they might have been written by a person who only has 5 seconds to Create a character because said person is a bit to lazy al while having no Idea what a Human is.<br />
They are Mostly poorly written because, well They

          <span style="display: none;" id="review218029">
        are to perfect for the Situation where the show takes place in because Most of the Situations Rely on Tension &quot;will Character X survive or win?&quot; and that Tension is just gone when I know that the Character is Perfect or has Gary stu plot Armour.<br />
I like Characters who have Clear mistakes like a Ninja who is poorly skilled in Ninjitsu and the art of Silence or A guy who made Mistakes in his past which Costed him a arm and a leg.<br />
I like these Characters because I can see them Grow and overcome their Flaws.<br />
With Gary Stus, I hardly see them overcome their flaws because They &quot;OFCOURSE!&quot; have no Flaws to begin with.<br />
<br />
So can a Gary Stu character work Good in a show?<br />
Well, it can as long as that character either is:<br />
1. a Interesting and Compelling Character to me who Actually Grows and Develops<br />
2. Introduced as Perfect but then starts making Mistakes as the shows on<br />
or<br />
3. a Character who is in a show which clearly Ridicules that type of Character/Makes jokes surrounding his/her perfection in such a way that the show is at least Fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Here Enters &quot;Sakamoto Desu ga?&quot; with the Character of Sakamoto, or as we call him Swagamoto because he is &quot;Cooler&quot; but in most cases &quot;Coolest&quot;.<br />
His Character basically Screams out &quot;GARY STUUUU!&quot; because he is so Perfect,<br />
While all the other Characters just Bask in his glory.<br />
So did the Show do the 3 things I mentioned earlier?<br />
Well it only did the 3rd one and then Fully embraced it like it should.<br />
<br />
Sakamoto desu ga? is an episodic show where Every episode is Actually 2 episodes spread over 24 Minutes equally.<br />
in each episode, Swagamoto has to put up with Other students who (Like me) Dislike Gary Stu Characters or Help out fellow Students who need his help Resulting in him Getting into Various Situations where his Perfection is Needed.<br />
These Situations work very well with Swagamoto&#039;s perfection which then Results in Comedic High-jinx.<br />
I like that kind of humor because it is Just Ridiculous, makes fun of my most hated Arch-type the Gary Stu and Above all, is Actually Funny in my Opinion.<br />
However, these kinds of Situations are putting the Side Characters at the Background while Sakamoto is perfectly in the spotlights and they don&#039;t get much screen-time and they are Just average students and nothing more just like Students are in Reality Minus the Animeness which is sad because they could have been Interesting characters.<br />
However, I See the train of thought of these Characters, like they were Observing Sakamoto Just like I the watcher was Observing him. The side Characters are also more of a Main characters in The skits that involve them and Sakamoto, Making Sakamoto more of a Side Character while he is The main character because I see the Story through the eyes of the Side Characters.<br />
<br />
Sakamoto desu ga? is Clearly a Comedy Show that Looks Nicely Animated for that type of show and just Makes fun of Swagamoto&#039;s Ridiculus perfection and the Character of Swagamoto Could not work if the Show was not a Comedy but something else instead like an Serious Action show Because well You might know why.<br />
<br />
But the wonders of Comedy shows is that it is already Considered Enjoyabe if just the Jokes alone are funny Because Comedy to me just has to Rely on being funny.<br />
and That is what Sakamoto desu ga is, A really funny show.<br />
<br />
So if you are looking For a good laugh then at least check out this show.<br />
I can guarantee you that it will at least make you laugh once or many times.<br />
<br />
I give this Comedic show at this point, an well Deserved 8 (score might change overtime because it is still airing)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven&#039;t reviewed something in a long time so I might have made some pretty Critical errors so feel free to point them out in my Face at my profile if you want to.<br />
<br />
Have a Nice day Readers

    &quot;And on that day, no fucks were given... only swag&quot;.<br />
<br />
Make room for our new lord and savior... Sakamoto. Despite how much I enjoyed Sakamoto desu ga? I can fully understand this anime is not for everyone. However, I love comedy shows that don&#039;t take themselves seriously. Sakamoto took a similar approach to Nichijou in the fact that it didn&#039;t give a shit. It wasn&#039;t trying to cater towards a specific category of viewer and stuck to its repetitive yet effective style of humor, with its over exaggeration of daily, normal events. In doing so, it became the unsung hero of the season for me, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222629">
        made me appreciate the whimsical side of normalcy. For now, despite whether or not you agree with me, depress your mute button and let me explain Sakamoto&#039;s greatness to you.<br />
<br />
Sometimes less is more, and I couldn&#039;t think of a better phrase to sum up this show. Sakamoto desu ga? flew onto the scene this season headed by the well known director, Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, School Rumble). The setting is simple, a standard Japanese high school with your pranksters, babes and nerds. But what makes this high school different is that it&#039;s enrolled the embodiment of perfection that is Sakamoto. He&#039;s tall dark and handsome, and can do no wrong. He performs every task quickly and concisely, emulating a smirk that would drop panties from a mile away. Whether he&#039;s an alien or robot doesn&#039;t really matter, since it would only add confirmation to the ridiculousness that this anime contains. Countless people wish to disrupt Sakamoto&#039;s greatness for one reason or another but constantly fail in doing so. The methods in which their feeble attempts are vanquished always seem to have me rolling. One minute Sakamoto is fighting a bee with a protractor and the next he&#039;s attacking people with soft drinks. The &quot;Secret Techniques&quot; employed in some episodes were a riot, most specifically the ones in the adult video episode. Some of those scenes were pure comedic gold. The important thing to remember here is that Sakamoto desu ga? was produced on a rather low budget, and although it doesn&#039;t do many things, what it does it nails. It truly embodies greatness through simplicity.<br />
<br />
Another thing Sakamoto does well is the accurate transposition of its source material. If you&#039;re anything like me (being a primary anime viewer), you get tired of the phrase &quot;oh, that&#039;s not how it is in the manga!&quot; So when an adaptation executes well and I don&#039;t have to hear that talk, everyone is happy. Well done Studio Deen! They&#039;ve been responsible for some rather big budget titles over the years (Fate series etc.), so to see them succeed with something on the contrary is impressive. With some anime the season, I went into each episode unaware of what I was going to get. Since I watched the series as it aired, I&#039;m looking for something consistent that will bring me back excited each week. By the end of the first four or five episodes of Sakamoto, I sort of knew what to expect from it every Saturday. If I don&#039;t have the luxury of binge watching it, give me something to look forward to in each episode!<br />
<br />
Similarly to the comedy, the negatives in Sakamoto are mostly preferential. For cultural reasons there were some jokes that went over my head but didn&#039;t necessarily deter me from finding them amusing. Also, episode six was an absolute bore. Watching a bunch of kids follow Sakamoto down a white line for 10+ minutes is not my idea of a good time. The elicit one-sided love affair with Sakamoto&#039;s friend&#039;s mom kind of made me nauseous at times. Fortunately enough, Sakamoto&#039;s tireless acts of evading countered my disgusted emotions quite well. As much as I hate to say it, this series could fall flat at times which probably hindered it from being an 8/10 for me. As previously stated, I can understand why people don&#039;t like the show. I can usually find most comedy styles humorous in anime, but slapstick and stupid humor are some of my favorite sub-genres. And although most of the jokes were way out of left field, instead of getting the forced vibe I did accept it as commonplace given Sakamoto&#039;s flawless behavior. Non-comedy fans may not &quot;get&quot; Sakamoto, and that&#039;s fine.  This show was not geared towards everyone&#039;s perspective of what qualifies as funny. I do admit, even as someone who is a fan of this comedy style, I could feel myself losing interest in the last two episodes.<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, Sakamoto is really the only thing that matters in this show.  Sure, there are supportive cast mates strewn about, but none of them really make or break the show.  Our lord and savior, Sakamoto sweats perfection, and makes even the manliest of men blush with a mere smile.  Sometimes I&#039;m not sure if I should laugh or be entirely creeped out by some of the character&#039;s reactions to Sakamoto&#039;s escapades.... But I&#039;m not sure that it makes any difference.  There has been a debate among the forums of whether he&#039;s an alien or not. Again, the over-analytic approach some anime fans have grown accustomed to will not translate well into this show.  Coming from a reasonable critic, shut your brain off while watching this series and just enjoy the senseless comedy. Sakamoto is sort of a one trick pony, so there really isn&#039;t much development in him, and there weren&#039;t any instances of internal monologue or breaking the fourth wall.  I think adding too much or maybe any development to his character would&#039;ve been detrimental to the show&#039;s atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The art isn&#039;t anything special in Sakamoto desu ga? Any slightly seasoned anime fan could notice the show&#039;s lower budget in its art.  Aside from the OP, there aren&#039;t many instances of bright or vivid color schemes, and the character models are dull and slightly cloned (although you could argue that this was intentional). I did find the students who were drawn to look like they were in their 20&#039;s or 30&#039;s rather amusing, even more evidence that the writers didn&#039;t take the show seriously.  The backgrounds are often recycled and bland, but in an anime mostly shown in a school, you can&#039;t expect much else.<br />
<br />
The OP as mentioned above was my favorite of the season.  The small animations were all to accentuate Sakamoto&#039;s greatness, and the music was powerful and triumphant.  I loved watching the various props he&#039;d use to sing with or use as musical instruments.  The ED was a calming way to end the comedy from each episode, and it grew on me the longer I watched the series.  The rest of the soundtrack consisted of a couple of recycled songs, most notably the ditty that played prior to each time Sakamoto swooped in doing something mesmerizing. I enjoyed it every time. Sakamoto&#039;s voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was quite brilliant in his classy portrayal.  Kubota, played by Akira Ishida, was phenomenal.  He was a large reason the character gave off such a creepy vibe.<br />
<br />
So, to be fair, Sakamoto desu ga was the anime of the season for me.  Its inflated representation of the &quot;perfect&quot; guy at school made me laugh constantly, and there was no way I could guess what he would do next.  This anime is certainly not for everyone, and my score is entirely dependent on my preference.  I&#039;d recommend Sakamoto to fans of shows like Nichijou, Gintama or Chromartie High School, but if you&#039;re not a fan of mindless comedy I&#039;d stay away.  Unlike its main protagonist, it&#039;s not perfect by any means, and sometimes ventures too far to get a laugh, but overall I found it to be highly enjoyable.  As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews!<br />

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
Well, Sakamoto desu ga? doesn’t have an interesting and complex storyline. It has a cool guy named Sakamoto who swags his way through every situation he’s ever faced with.<br />
<br />
Characters are made interesting through their complexity, with them coming to deal with their flaws, accept them and improve upon them where they can. That’s what makes an interesting and complex storyline.<br />
<br />
In a lot of ways, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is the One Punch Man of school-life anime. One Punch Man is about a hero named Saitama who destroys every enemy he faces with one punch and zero effort.<br />
<br />
Sakamoto Desu Ga? is about a kid

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219633">
        named Sakamoto who has similar results against his foes. But instead of fighting giant monsters, he’s going up against school bullies and manipulative girls.<br />
<br />
And instead of defeating them with a punch, he defeats them with sheer charm and charisma.<br />
<br />
And by “defeat,” I mean “make them like him and also make them better people overall in the process<br />
<br />
The really impressive thing about Sakamoto Desu Ga? so far is the ability it has to take a simple concept and keep it fresh in a number of situations.<br />
<br />
The negative thing about the anime is that there is no character development, no plot development. Each episode basically just sums up the same way: “Someone is going to try to make Sakamoto look bad, let’s see how it ultimately backfires and makes him look way cooler.”<br />
<br />
 Despite all this, it’s so weird and quirky that it’s ultimately still quite enjoyable. Despite it just featuring the same gag, playing out in different ways, it’s still a ton of fun. That’s incredibly impressive to me, and speaks to the quality of the gag. But I have to wonder just how long it can keep up.<br />
<br />
The secondary characters in the series are practically non-existent. The few that are recurring aren’t especially interesting, even down to their names. such as :<br />
<br />
There’s “popular girl who tries to seduce Sakamoto for the sake of status, but keeps getting hilariously foiled.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t list all of the  names, because honestly, they’re not important to the series. Sakamoto Desu Ga? is a one-man show, and the other characters are little more than props to further the legend of Sakamoto.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even the opening credits feature all of exactly one character.<br />
<br />
It’s easy to see Sakamoto Desu Ga? is made on a budget. The very first episode opens with a wide shot of three guys tossing a volleyball around in the school yard in the most minimal, circular animation imaginable.<br />
<br />
The action sequences rely heavily on dressed-up still shots, simple circular animation patterns, and motion blur. They do a good job of hiding the lack of funding where they can, but suffice to say there aren’t any sequences that are going to leave you slack-jawed in awe and appreciation.<br />
<br />
Spoiler<br />
--------<br />
Episode 6 was really terrible due to the fact that Sakamoto and three kids was walking in a white line which took most of the time consumption on the episode which was rough about 10minutes &quot;WASTED&quot; footage. This episode really lacked being entertaining aswell being enjoyable.<br />
<br />
All in all: <br />
Animation: 5/6<br />
Character development : 3<br />
Sound: 5<br />
Enjoyment: 4/5<br />
Overall : 4<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review if you got this far and i hope you found it useful and take in ideas on what is to come when you watch this series.

    This anime... just wow. My friends seemed to like it, but I honestly struggled to get through the whole series. It starts off well enough, we meet Sakamoto, the impossibly perfect high school boy, able to do any task with efficiency and grace, no matter how outrageous said task is. But then that&#039;s it. That&#039;s the anime. Here is some cool, infallible guy WHO DOESN&#039;T CHANGE EVER.<br />
If Sakamoto had maybe developed in some way - i.e. become more human, hell had turned out not to be a human - I might have liked this anime. But I can&#039;t. I can&#039;t sit through so many episodes

    This is truly a horrible anime. This thing barely worked in manga format because you could read it quickly(and even THEN you tired after 5 chapters when the novelty wore off because it was just a repeat thing with no jokes or anything every damn chapter, while the latter half was barely worth reading despite only having a few chapters over 20), but when it&#039;s endlessly dragged out in anime format and no new parts or innovations which adds to the experience? Yeah, you have a dreadful or even pathetic piece of crap that you just shouldn&#039;t waste your time watching.<br />
<br />
This anime has pathetic characters,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287746">
        pathetic story and offers ridiculously low amounts of enjoyment. You might even go minus on the enjoyment part and just wish to kill yourself while watching this. It might be slightly better if you haven&#039;t read the manga, but I don&#039;t see this thing being worthy of anything above 3 stars even then.<br />
<br />
None of the side characters have any soul or special part about them, at most they&#039;re all kind of obnoxious. The whole thing is just about sakamoto showing that he&#039;s got a bigger d*ck than anyone else and amaze everyone with his rather impossible actions as he flawlessly avoids every possibly negative thing for himself, dumbfounding people over and over again. This is all this anime is. Sakamoto isn&#039;t even interesting as a character, just like in the manga, he&#039;s a soulless shell with no clear emotions, no goals and no parts that stand out other than the fact that he can&#039;t be screwed over because he&#039;s so &quot;amazing&quot;. We don&#039;t know who he is, we don&#039;t know what he is, we don&#039;t know his real goals, we don&#039;t know what he feels about anything. How could such a character be likable, especially when he needs to prop up the show by himself since none of the side-characters have anything to offer other than being retarded and way too eager to kiss his arse?<br />
<br />
Just spare yourself from the frustration and never, ever watch this. If you really feel like you want to know what is going on, read the manga instead, it&#039;s much faster and way more enjoyable thanks to that. Nothing really happens in the anime that doesn&#039;t happen in the manga anyway.

    If I asked you what came to mind when I mentioned the words &quot;cool,&quot; or perhaps &quot;suave,&quot; what would your answer be? For the students at Gakubun Prefectural High School the answer would most definitely be &quot;Sakamoto.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sakamoto desu ga?&quot; is an anime which focuses around our main character Sakamoto. The niche of this anime is that Sakamoto is the coolest guy around; always figuring out the best answer to any given situation. Now, the plot of this show may not seem extraordinary, nor do I proclaim it to be; but the show manages to grasp your attention with it&#039;s own unique style. This show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223243">
        couples easy to follow scenes with a nice jazz-styled OST to create a calming vibe. The anime does a perfect job of creating an atmosphere where the viewer has time to sit back and unwind. <br />
<br />
To follow, there&#039;s another element of the show that I felt made it worth watching. The show inspires you. Sakamoto throughout the duration of the series always manages to find the best answers to even the trickiest situations; a trait which is inspiring and admirable. Watching Sakamoto pull off the feats that he does leaves the viewer with a sense of wanting to do the same in their own lives. It gives you the initiative to live like Sakamoto, without fear or regret, finding the best answer to all questions; which I feel alone is enough to make the anime enjoyable. <br />
<br />
To add to the inspiring atmosphere that the show creates there&#039;s also the comedy, which of course is meant to be the focal point of the show. The comedy wasn&#039;t phenomenal, but there were very few points in the show where I was not laughing or at least cracking a smile. The anime does not pull off too many hysterical jokes (that&#039;s not to say there aren&#039;t any), but it does pull off consistent quality ones; a feat which will leave you happy and laughing throughout each episode. <br />
<br />
The OST, I have to mention, is also very well done. The aesthetic of the music develops a calming and fanciful environment in which we can watch each character live their life. The OST is truly fitting of the anime&#039;s genre and purpose; and for that I must give it high regards. <br />
<br />
The art is very-well done, surprisingly so for a show that doesn&#039;t involve any extensive fight scenes or breath-taking scenery. There was even a &quot;fight scene&quot; at one point during the show that was animated better than some of the big fights I&#039;ve seen in animes with extensive budgets - that, to me, says a lot about the quality of the work that went into the show. <br />
<br />
The only downfall I&#039;d have to mention about the anime is there&#039;s no evident story-line to follow. If you&#039;re a sucker for a good story, then this anime may not intrigue you. The purpose of the show is to follow the comical school life of the coolest guy you may ever know, Sakamoto; but at the same time that&#039;s all it is. There is not meant to be a story to follow simply because that&#039;s how the show was constructed. There is, however, a small underlying plot device that defines the show and is the reason I am giving it such a high mark. This underlying plot device is hinted at in the anime itself, and I will make a point not to spoil it here. <br />
<br />
To conclude this review; I hold &quot;Sakamoto desu ga?&quot; in high regards and I loved sitting down to watch the show each week. It&#039;s relaxing, fun, consistently funny, and a great show for anyone who wants to unwind and laugh. I would definitely recommend this anime.

    Sakamoto is the superior being. An evolution of the human being. He is many breeds apart from you. He is a gentleman, he is on god-level.<br />
YOU WANT TO BE LIKE SAKAMOTO!<br />
Someday, you&#039;ll meet Sakamoto, asking: &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
Then, Sakamoto will calmly say: &quot;Haven&#039;t you heard? I&#039;m Sakamoto.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is an incredibly funny comedy anime! I cried of laughter while watching this masterpiece of an anime.<br />
<br />
I will now describe Sakamoto in a few words: Handsome, sublime, god, lord&amp;savior, sublime and perfect.<br />
<br />
Though, this anime is mostly fooling around. It&#039;s a great anime for everyone, any time. I highly recommend you watch this. It&#039;s a must-watch. <br />
<br />
Sakamoto is calm

    People always said that “Perfection is not always easy to achieve”<br />
<br />
Really!!!!  Let me tell you about “The Legend of Sakamoto”<br />
<br />
Along time ago, in class 1-2 of Gakubun Perfectual High School. One student had the entire school’s attention from the very first day. Carrying out class duties in STYLE, eating his lunch in STYLE, standing in the hall in STYLE, studying in STYLE, walking in STYLE, talking in STYLE, and even singing in SYLE. Every single move he makes is COOL! COOLER! COOLEST! And the name of the student is Sakamoto. There was nobody is PERFECT being except Sakamoto. Nobody can defeat him. In fact,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222501">
        all of girl student love him and certain of the boy student jealous at him. Furthermore, Sakamoto is the only PERFECT person in the world and he’s the CHOSEN ONE. <br />
<br />
Out of the blue “Deus Ex Machina” is finally here. Oh thank you!!!!! <br />
-	Sakamoto can help you pass in exam<br />
-	Sakamoto can help you to defeat any gangster<br />
-	Sakamoto can help you how to deal with the problem<br />
-	Sakamoto inspired us how to became a fabulous person<br />
-	Sakamoto can woo any girls with his fabulous face and his charisma<br />
-	Sakamoto has a lot of idea to make something become wonderful<br />
-	Sakamoto is our greatest HERO<br />
-	Sakamoto is really “BADASS” in martial arts<br />
-	Sakamoto’s an extremely capable (of) all the things in “STYLE”<br />
-	Contact number 010-xxxxxxxx……if you have any problem, just call Sakamoto <br />
-	All the people always say “WOW &amp; SUGOI” when Sakamoto show something incredible<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is :<br />
-	Humorous<br />
-	You can be a calm person<br />
-	Sakamoto taught us about never intimidated by thugs<br />
-	Sakamoto show us, about forgive someone is really important, even someone doing bad things to him <br />
-	Our confident will rise and its taught us never give up on something and don’t be indecisive person  <br />
-	Sakamoto show about justice is really paramount<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember this “Precious Phrase” <br />
<br />
“Keep Calm and Watch Sakamoto desu ga?” <br />
<br />
“This is Sakamoto. Sakamoto has everything <br />
   and he’s always rescue people. <br />
   Sakamoto never complain about his classmate <br />
   even certain people try to tricks him. <br />
   Sakamoto is nice person. Be like Sakamoto”<br />
<br />
“THE END”<br />
<br />
<br />
Now about the “seiyuu” Midorikawa Hikaru, He was cast as a Sakamoto in the story and his voice is really unique and suitable. Next, a charismatic Sakamoto who attracted girls and a few guy also admired him. He’s always calm down, never flustered &amp; not afraid, even in an emergency. I really like his appearance and kindness. Sometime, we can called him as “KUUDERE” person or fabulous guy. When Sakamoto has purpose on something, he will do whatever it takes.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of the series is really great, especially Opening theme, COOLEST by Customi Z. Its include a motivation words like a COOL, COOLER, COOLEST, OH YEAH !, YEAH !, YOU ARE SPECIAL, BREAK OUT !, WAKE UP ! Seriously, I got such spirit when I heard this song and the music is really catchy and great. <br />
<br />
Finally, the story gave me a lot of enjoyment. Truthfully, Nami Sano create a bizarre story. I think the creator try to teach us, how to become stylish person and brilliant person. In fact, I could call a masterpiece work. I laughed like a drain when I watched the story. In nutshell, Sakamoto desu ga? One of the most successful sitcom takes place in spring 2016. For the whole of the story Sakamoto desu ga? is magnificent &amp; I have absolutely no doubt about Sakamoto desu ga? Is a masterpiece. In fact, Sakamoto desu ga? Is quite similar narrative with Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou &amp; Gintama.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, it’s Sakamoto desu ga? results !!!!!<br />
<br />
What I watched<br />
Sakamoto desu ga?<br />
<br />
What I Expected<br />
I will become a FAMOUS person<br />
<br />
What I Got<br />
I have total confidence, when I do something<br />

    Who exactly is... Sakamoto-kun?<br />
<br />
Sakamoto is... Cool<br />
Cooler<br />
COOLEST!<br />
<br />
Sakamoto is... Our destined leader<br />
<br />
Sakamoto is... The embodiment of perfection<br />
Swag<br />
STYLE<br />
<br />
Everything Sakamoto does... <br />
Is STYLISH<br />
<br />
Story: 10<br />
<br />
So, exactly what kind of world does our hero live in? He lives in a world of style, cool, and swag. Every movement he does is bleeding cool. Sakamoto does not live in a world... The world IS Sakamoto. Sakamoto makes our lives have so much more meaning. Sakamoto helps us through tears and sorrow.<br />
Sakamoto-kun does not fear the trials and tribulations ahead.<br />
Rather, they fear him.<br />
Sakamoto inspires in all of us a desire to better a situation, no matter how tough. <br />
Sakamoto-kun is the story.<br />
Sakamoto-kun is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review228394">
        the world.<br />
Sakamoto-kun is... Cool.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
<br />
Sakamoto-kun was only made possible by a team of godly animators. Why is that? Because Sakamoto-kun is our master, and our master only invokes the gods of animation themselves.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
<br />
The sound is that of a heavenly angelic chorus singing to us from the heavens. Only the most ultimate forms of swag are invoked in these timeless pieces. Bach and Beethoven quake with awe in the presence of Sakamoto&#039;s beautiful chorus.<br />
Sakamoto&#039;s muse clearly states in the opening how... Cool... Cooler... COOLEST this godlike entertainment is, with the ending song bringing the audience to tears once the perfection that is the &quot;episodes&quot; of the show ends.<br />
The voice acting is only that of top-dollar actors. Sakamoto&#039;s voice actor has reached his heavenly ascension through his role as the physical embodiment of our master, Sakamoto-kun, which is of course a joyous occasion for all of the human race as we all wish to reach enlightenment through Sakamoto-kun.<br />
<br />
Characters: 10<br />
<br />
Our cast of characters are all very likeable as they are all faithful followers of our Sakamoto-kun. The audience is moved to tears while watching our wonderful leader Sakamoto help our poor souls reach enlightenment through his ways. <br />
However, I am afraid I cannot grade the perfection itself that is Sakamoto-kun himself.<br />
He is untouchable.<br />
He is swag.<br />
He is cool... Cooler... COOLEST!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
<br />
Watching Sakamoto and his pure, utter perfection at everything happen in motion will bring anyone to tears of joy. Sakamoto is perfect. We are not worthy to be in his presence, however he has made it so, bringing pure enjoyment to everyone who witnesses.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />
I do not believe that I am worthy enough to describe how perfect Sakamoto is.<br />
Sakamoto should be witnessed and followed by every being.<br />
Sakamoto is cool<br />
Cooler<br />
COOLEST!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
In all seriousness this show is pretty great. Go watch it.

    Sakamoto Desu Ga is a gem that shines brilliantly in the Spring 2016 season. Its an amazing comedy that is definetly worth investing your time in. While I wasnt expecting much from this show Its become my favorite series of all time and one I highly reccomend<br />
<br />
STORY: Sakamoto is the coolest kid at school who can do everything in the most stylish way possible. While the series follows Sakamoto but its really the story of how he helps everyone grow around him. Sakamoto Desu Ga is episodic and follows the narrative of hilarious short stories of everyone&#039;s interactions with Sakamoto. Wether his classmates are trying

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222804">
        to foil him or help him Sakamoto solves any problem often with the other chracter in that short story becoming a better person because of meeting Sakamoto. The story is amazingly creative in the everyday tasks Sakamoto and  co. face wether they&#039;re excorsizing a ghost, walking all over the town, or having a sumo match the show presents any task they face in the most hilarious way possible. 10/10<br />
<br />
ART: The way you know if a series is well animated is if you dont notice the animation at all and it feels like a living breathing series. SDG does just that it&#039;s very well animated with its fluid motions and nice character design. The series isnt meant to be the most amazingly animated work of art like a Psycho Pass or Fate/Zero but it is very nice to look at, and the art especially shines whenever Sakamoto is on screen as the lighting is shown to portray Sakamoto as the Flashiest and most amazing person as possible and they easily succeed. The Sakamoto scenes can easily make you buy into the idea that Sakamoto is the coolest person alive because of how amazingly hes presented.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS: The cast of Sakamoto is very large but offers a very memorable selection of them. I could be here all day talking about how amazing Sakamoto is and thats because I truly believe he is. Studio Deen goes out of their way to make Sakamoto the coolest whether it be their amazing visuals when hes on screen, the Suave music that always plays when hes around, or his amazing feats he is the best character of the series and is absolutely hilarious. Kubota sakamoto&#039;s sidekick is absolutey hilarious and serves as the kind of ugly sister to sakamoto. The Three delinquents always get into some mischief, Hayabousa is an absolute badass, Aina is a dual faced flirtatious psycho who is one of the many girls fawning over Sakamoto, Sera is just completely hilarous (ill come back to him in a second). These are all characters ive grown fond of in my 12 ep. run of SDG because they have human emotions and feel like people I could actually meet and be friends with and those are a limited number to not make this review too long. Sakamoto helps all these characters grow inderiectly and it is rewarding too see them do so. <br />
<br />
SOUND: The soundtrack is amazing and very Suave reflecting the feel of the series. From the high powered OP to the Cool soundtrack around Sakamoto the soundtrack. Yasuhiko Fukuda  gives a great OST  and im excited to see what he brings us in the future.<br />
<br />
COMEDY: The series is hialrous and is always bringing a great sense of humor. If I had to compare how funny it is to other anime id say its up there with Gintama and Barakamon two of my favorite anime series. The show has great execution and always brings us the most simple situations in a hilarous manor. <br />
<br />
OVERALL: Sakamoto Desu Ga was a pleasure to watch and is easily one of my favorite series of all time. From the comedic execution to the great characters there is little not too love. SDG earns a 10/10 for me and a strong reccomendation

    Sakamoto desu ga? was an anime that I was excited for, I saw some clips around the web and thought that the anime would be absolutely hilarious. Saw the first episode, I was like eh it&#039;s alright, it&#039;s just the first episode it should get better. Second episode, in terms of comedy just like the first, one scene that I thought was funny. So then I forced to watch episodes 3 to 5 in hopes that it would get better. It just didn&#039;t happen, sure there were a few funny scenes but then as each episode went by the anime just started to get more

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227531">
        and more ridiculous and that&#039;s when I realized. Sakamoto is like a character that I would have created in fifth grade which I sort of have when in class we were required to write. The humor is the same too, Sakamoto would have been the funniest thing in the world to me if I was back in fifth grade because I have written scenes where stupid and impossible things happen to make a main character look cool. What I&#039;m trying to say is, characters who are perfect in every way are just really lame and not funny or cool.

    What happens when you take a high school setting and add perfection itself, only second to God? Haven’t you heard? Sakamoto happens. <br />
<br />
This short but sweet comedy anime focuses on one gimmick only. Sakamoto being absolutely perfect in every situation, and his interactions with his classmates. It may seem like after some time, the anime loses its charm as the plot keeps on repeating, but fear not. The 12 episode limit keeps the pace steady. The story never gets boring or stale. Good soundtrack which incorporates jazz (obviously) keeps the anime smooth. The comedy is going to have you question “how does Sakamoto get out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review230583">
        of this one” in second half of the anime. And it’ll keep surprising you and make you laugh. A lot. My only complaint is that the show for me lacks rewatching value once you’ll see how Sakamoto overcomes his situations in the most perfect manner possible. But for one time only it’s a great ride. <br />
<br />
Production remains good. Animation looks great. Only flaws I saw were some CGI shots later in the series but they are so brief that you have to search for them in order to find them. <br />
<br />
Voice acting is on point on the male side. The female side lacks a little but considering context of the show (females being mainly fangirls of Sakamoto and not having any MAJOR role in the story outside of trying to get his heart I can understand that producers weren’t trying to have vast and diverse cast)<br />
<br />
Before you’ll know it, it’s going to be over. So don’t blink. You may miss some of this anime&#039;s awesomeness. <br />

    This review is for Sakamoto desu ga. When referring to this anime, I will not be using the question mark at the end because it messes with punctuation and makes it complicated. This is my first anime review because I&#039;m sure that I can give an accurate and objective perspective of what this anime is and isn&#039;t. As such, I want people to decide for themselves whether or not they enjoy Sakamoto desu ga. The purpose of this review is just to spell out what Sakamoto desu ga entails so that people who are watching and people who are interested in watching will know what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review227318">
        to make of this anime. Now, let&#039;s begin.<br />
<br />
For those who dislike reading long blurbs, I&#039;ll summarize what I want to say right here. Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy anime that uses the main character, Sakamoto, in little skits. These skits will always involve another person trying to make Sakamoto look bad, but apparently Sakamoto is so omnipotently perfect that he can&#039;t possibly look bad and any attempt to do so will only highlight how cool he is. As such, this anime has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. This is not my opinion, this is fact. To contradict this statement would be a blatant lie. Now, before those who enjoy this anime gather their pitchforks, I am not saying that this anime is unenjoyable or dumb. My opinion is that this anime is a pathetic excuse for a comedy that is not worth my time, hence why this is on my dropped list, but that&#039;s just my opinion. For other people, maybe the skits are wonderfully funny and Sakamoto&#039;s character archetype is so perfect for them that this overrides the fact that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme.<br />
<br />
As such, this anime is hit or miss based on people&#039;s personal tastes. If you like the characters and how they revolve around Sakamoto, then great, you&#039;ve found something that you love. If you&#039;re two episodes in and you don&#039;t see anything worthwhile in Sakamoto desu ga, then quit while you&#039;re ahead. The series doesn&#039;t get better. In fact, for those who don&#039;t immediately enjoy the anime, I can guarantee that Sakamoto desu ga gets much, much, worse. Spare yourself the trauma. <br />
<br />
Wow, that was the summary? Well then, okay. From here on out there may be spoilers for Sakamoto desu ga, but it&#039;s not like it matters. If you&#039;re watching Sakamoto desu ga for the plot, then I pity what your life has come to. <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
There is no story. Period. I could take episode 1 and 12, set them aside, and jumble up episodes 2-11. The end result would make just as much sense as how the anime is actually structured. Each episode has absolutely nothing to do with the previous and next episode. The only thing that changes is the people that admire Sakamoto. After each skit, the people who originally tried to make Sakamoto look bad later come to realize his godliness. That&#039;s really the only thing that changes from episode to episode. The only sign that you&#039;re actually getting deeper into the anime. Really. No, I&#039;m not kidding. <br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I didn&#039;t notice anything extremely good about the art, but I also have no complaints with how the anime looks. Then again, I&#039;m no art expert.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
Nothing from the soundtrack stood out to me. I actually barely remember it. At least that means I also didn&#039;t remember anything bad about it either.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Again, there is absolutely no character development. Anyone who says that there is is lying to themselves. Additionally, the change from &quot;hating Sakamoto&quot; to &quot;worshiping Sakamoto&quot; can hardly count as character development. That&#039;s literally the only thing that changes in this anime. As such, all the characters come as they appear. They don&#039;t change at all, so it&#039;s all up to personal preference whether you like them or not. I personally could not tolerate the presence of any of the characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 1/10<br />
This is entirely personal opinion. If you found enjoyment in this, then congratulations. If you didn&#039;t find enjoyment within the first two episodes, please quit while you are ahead. <br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
Objectively, anyone can say that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. Because this show is fatally lacking in these departments, it can only possibly make up for itself through its art, sound, and static characters. Art and sound in anime are largely up to personal taste. I found nothing to actively complain about, yet nothing to actively praise about these two features. Because Sakamoto desu ga employs zero character development, all the characters that are introduced never change at all. That means the viewers will just get the characters as they are. If someone loves all the characters, they will find enjoyment in the show. If you can&#039;t bear any of the characters like me, you&#039;ll find every aspect of this show irritating and annoying. <br />
<br />
Sakamoto desu ga is really just hit or miss, but at least it&#039;s not a complicated anime. That&#039;s why this is my first review. If you enjoy Sakamoto desu ga, please keep enjoying it for your own sake. It stays the same through and through, so you&#039;ll definitely find even more enjoyment in it. If you hate Sakamoto desu ga, please quit watching for your own sake. The anime stays the same through and through, so you&#039;ll definitely continue to be annoyed by it. Sakamoto is able to enchant all of his acquaintances and make them see the good in him. Unfortunately Sakamoto does not have the power to make all viewers find the good in his anime, so if you haven&#039;t liked Sakamoto desu ga so far, turn back now.

    Cool -&gt; Cooler -&gt; Coolest -&gt; Swagmoto<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
Sakamoto is the coolest and most capable guy in the history of mankind...that&#039;s basically it. Every episode gives us a glimpse of how awesome this guy it. If you think this premse will run stale pretty quickly, be reassured, it does not. Not every story is top notch, but this anime has so many ideas that you will be entertained most of the time.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Sakamoto is a pretty boy, but everybody else is pretty...pretty (I should have used a thesaurus there) as well. Except for Kubota and his mother, they are just disgusting, but that&#039;s the point of their characters.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223490">
        In general, this anime looks very good, but the focus is clearly on the characters.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The opening is good, the ending works as well. I really loved that piece of music that plays every time Sakamoto does something amazing. The voices are all very stereotype, but that&#039;s part of the charm.<br />
8/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Did I mention already just how awesome Sakamoto is? Because he&#039;s awesome. Somehow he manages to overshadow everybody else without coming off as a jerk. The other characters do what they are supposed to, the only one who kinda stands out a little is Hayabusa. Oh, and Fujita is a sweetie.<br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
As I mentioned, not every story is a hit, but most of them are. Sakamotos antics are always hilarious and incredible to witness. I&#039;m not sure if they would have been able to keep this up for more than 12/13 episodes though. But for a weekly dose, it was absolutely worth it.<br />
8/10<br />

Overall:<br />

    If there wasn’t enough fabulousness this season, don’t worry, Sakamoto is here. Sakamoto desu ga is exactly how it looks and sounds. An entire series focused on a character that is perfect is a pretty risky job. The series can easily become repetitive and boring if it heavily relies on one joke. Sakamoto manages to consistently entertain with its variety of different jokes, that all use the same backbone. It’s just the sheer amount of creativity and wackiness that can make Sakamoto look not only perfect to the people around him, but also the viewers. But it’s not just the comedy Sakamoto succeeds at, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222776">
        also its parody on common tropes in anime, which makes the series seem much more intelligent than it out to be. <br />
<br />
~{Story}~<br />
Well, Sakamoto desu ga is exactly as the premise says it is. The series revolves around Sakamoto doing wacky, yet fabulous stuff in very weird comedic situations. He’ll avoid bullying, smoke bubble, run like the Darwin Evolution diagrams, create subliminal messages in split-seconds… you get the point. People say that there is no such thing as perfection. They clearly haven’t heard about Sakamoto. He has the girls being deredere for him, the guys being tsundere for him, and birds being dandere for him… yeah, that’s the power of Sakamoto’s charm. Sakamoto is primarily episodic, as each episode (or more like half of an episode) revolves around a comedic situations involving Sakamoto. The series doesn’t have a major plot in the series until the very end, but that’s not the highlight of the series. The highlights are the comedic situations throughout the series. The writing of these comedic situations is somewhat genius and the tiny stories themselves are very unique and creative. And the ending is satisfying enough to be a fitting conclusion to the series, that doesn’t need any more continuations. It leaves a lot of questions open, but that’s what maintains the charm of the series – who is Sakamoto really?<br />
Story: 5/10<br />
<br />
~{Presentation}~<br />
If there’s one thing that’s fabulous in Sakamoto desu ga besides Sakamoto himself, it’s the style. The way the series presents its comedy is fantastic. Characters will talk about the most absurd things in the most common fashion, OST will be an intentional mismatch for the situation to create more comedy, and Sakamoto will make the most bizarre things look like a typical day for an average teenager. For an anime that heavily relies on one joke for laughs, it manages to do so properly. The amount of creativity the series has makes it very impressive. Sakamoto’s jokes may come from a randomly generated joke machine, but it manages to blend these absurd elements together that it makes is feel consistent. The series also has moments when the series takes a serious tone in situations, and this is when the series starts to break apart. The serious moments don’t seem tense enough to be serious enough and they only make the moments boring. Though it is necessary to have these moments to create a main story, it’s just that it feels so out-of-place that it feels like I’m watching a different series. Luckily these moments end quick and the comedy kicks in again. But there are moments when the series can be heartwarming, such as its conclusion and its final moments with Sakamoto.<br />
Presentation: 6.5/10<br />
<br />
~{Character}~<br />
Sakamoto desu ga is all about Sakamoto and Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. And for a series that primarily focuses on one character, it is important for him to be likable and good as a character. Well, Sakamoto is more than that, as he’s fabulous! Sakamoto is a character without any flaws and perfect to the core. But he’s not a Gary Stu, because he’s too extreme to be so. He’s more like a parody of it. Sakamoto’s character is here to pull fun at other characters from other series that are considered perfect. And a formula like this can get boring quite easily, but Sakamoto manages to keep us entertained by going through even wackier situations. He doesn’t have a backstory, and there’s no real depth to him, but that would ruin the purpose of the series. Sakamoto has always been a mystery with his inhuman abilities, and it’s up for the viewers to decide who his really is. No matter what he is though, he’s still Sakamoto. Even though the series primarily focuses on its protagonist, the supporting characters are also fun and likable. You got the tsundere bully Acchan (who plays a bigger role near the end), bully victim Kubota, delinquent Hayabusa, and much more. The series does feature an antagonist, but he never ends up being an interesting character.<br />

~{Art}~, <br />
Considering Studio Deen’s track record of having subpar art, Sakamoto desu ga’s art quality is a lot better than most of their work. For the most part, it’s very clean and consistent, and the series manages to have good detaining even for background objects. The backgrounds are really good looking and have a good amount of details. Deen was always good at having detailed architectures, and Sakamoto is no exception. Characters also look clean and neat, though they do lack some detailing. Character design is quite interesting, as the perfect Sakamoto is shown to have glasses, which was an interesting choice. Acchan’s toque also makes him stand out a lot. And overall the character designs are good and somewhat unique. <br />
Art: 6/10<br />
<br />
~{Animation}~<br />
This is where Sakamoto desu ga starts to stumble. Studio Deen doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to production values and animation fluidity. However, they managed to nail Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu’s quality from last season, so one could hope they would do the same in Sakamoto. Sadly it’s only okay, nothing more. Character fluidity is quite lacking and disappointing and backgrounds, though they look good, feel very static and flat. And the series heavily relies on still shots so less will need to be animated. Though these still shots might have good art, the lack of animation in them shows that they were used to cut corners. Hey, at least the animations in the OP are great…<br />
Animation: 5/10<br />
<br />
~{Voice Acting}~<br />
The voice acting in Sakamoto desu ga is fabulous to say the least, as every character Is done with near perfect. Although, that is expected with such a good cast. Midorikawa Hikaru nails it as Sakamoto. His tone in his voice is always kept in an even level, just like how a perfect character like Sakamoto would talk. He makes sure to make his character lack emotion, yet not feel dead. He might have been the best choice for Sakamoto. Sugita Tomokazu does an outstanding job as Acchan, which it to be expected since Sugita is a wonderful seiyuu, especially for comedic situations. His over-the top tone in certain situations is hilarious. And Sugita nails his love for Sakamoto, by adding a girly tone to Acchan whenever he goes deredere for Sakamoto. Ishida Akira does a role I’ve never seen him do before. It astonishes me how he’s able to do Kubota so effortlessly. It just shows how talented he is. Other well-known seiyuu are also part of the series, such as Horie Yui, Nakahara Mai, Suzuki Tatsuhisa, and they all do an excellent job in what they have to do.<br />
Voice Acting: 8/10<br />

I guess you can say that the music is Sakamoto desu ga is the “coolest”. The OP, “COOLEST”, is absolutely perfect for a series like this. The vocals are nice and the lyrics are ridiculous (and it should be like that), and the music is great too. The OP matches the context of the anime so well because Sakamoto is indeed the coolest. The ED, “Nakushita Hibi ni Sayonara”, is also quite good. It’s not as memorable as the OP, but it’s nice enough. The vocals are nice and the music is soothing. The background music in the series is great and it works well with the series. Sakamoto’s theme, which you’ll be hearing a lot, matches every over-the-top situation Sakamoto’s in. Overall, the background music may not be the most inventive, but it works well with the anime.<br />
Music: 7/10<br />
<br />
~{Enjoyment}~<br />
Sakamoto desu ga is always a blast to watch. Very few comedy anime can make me laugh in every episode, and Sakamoto succeeds in doing so. The series is just so over-the-top, absurd, and ridiculous, that it’s hard not to find enjoyment out of it. Sakamoto’s perfection is to die for, and it’s always fun seeing him in weird, comedic situations. Whether it be running like the Darwin Evolution diagram, or Sakamoto using curtains to make breasts, or uses a balloon gun to threaten bullies, Sakamoto does all of this in ease and it’s fun seeing him do so. He remains a mystery throughout the series, and it’s up for the audience to decide who he really might be. Is he actually human or is he an alien? It’s up to you to decide. <br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
<br />
In the end, Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy you don’t want to miss out on. Parody comedy anime are pretty rare to see these days, so finding one that actually works is a blessing. The series is all about Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. It may be repetitive for some, but it’s impossible to deny the sheer creativeness and uniqueness the series has to offer. You won’t see comedic situations like the one you’ll see in Sakamoto. The production values are a little off, and the serious moments aren’t too great, but the comedy makes up for it. Do yourself a favor and fall in love with Sakamoto’s fabulousness. You won’t regret it! <br />
<br />
+ Sakamoto’s a cool protagonist who manages to entertain throughout the series<br />
+ Comedic situations are absurd and ridiculous, yet creative and inventive <br />
+ Fitting and somewhat heartwarming conclusion<br />
+ Fantastic voice acting for Sakamoto and the major supporting characters. <br />
- Production values are lacking <br />
- The serious tone, when it appears, don’t work well for the series<br />
<br />
Overall: 6.2/10

    Cool, Cooler, COOLEST!!!...and not just for Sakamoto, Studio DEEN as well.<br />
<br />
Well, LA will say it already, LA thinks Studio DEEN is two for twofer in terms of comedy anime (previous being KonoSuba).<br />
<br />
LA was worried as to Sakamoto&#039;s skits of always &quot;winning&quot; and it getting old and by the numbers, however and by in fact really quickly, LA found that the &quot;ways&quot; Sakamoto leads to his victory or him pleasing the masses and sometimes outright crazily amusing ways that the comedy doesn&#039;t get stale, it&#039;s the entire &quot;it&#039;s the journey not the destination&quot; scenario and Sakamoto executed it brilliantly.<br />
<br />
Characterization, well if you cannot believe it, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review222935">
        only do wee see Sakamoto&#039;s perfect nature, but also from his female and male classmates as well, most notably Yoshinou Kubota voiced by Akira Ishida an incredibly shy classmate, Atsushi Maeda voiced by Tomokazu Sugita a former delinquent along with his posse, Yuuya Sera voiced by Showtaro Morikubo an odd delinquent, Megumi Fujita voiced by Mai Nakahara, Aina Kuronuma voiced by Yui Horie Yagi voiced by Hitome Nabatame and Mii-chan voiced by Kana Ueda are all Sakamoto&#039;s fangirls. The delinquents at first are oddly weird and stereotypical delinquents, but come Sakamoto, they get some odd quirks that give them some personality. As for Sakamoto&#039;s fangirls, their fawning/fighting over Sakamoto are again typical fangirling, but once Sakamoto gives them screentime, they get some character development, fangirl wise, Megumi Fujita gets the most development and screentime, as for the delinquents, Atsushi Maeda and his posse gets the most. Yoshinobu gets his own episodes with Sakamoto too and Yoshinobu gains a backbone. More LA talks about the the minor characters, the more LA thinks the minor characters gets MORE character development than Sakamoto himself.<br />
<br />
Which makes a good point, Sakamoto, being his perfect self in terms of personality or backstory, we actually hardly know much about him yet LA still liked Sakamoto even without that, (though LA suspects Sakamoto is an alien or one of those Parasites from Rick and Morty in Total Rickall) or something you wanna know why?, Sakamoto is a catalyst or a great punchline with the minor characters being the reactants to the utterly bizarre situations Sakamoto does, him being perfect or otherwise. It&#039;s some actually great comedy routine.<br />
<br />
Now LA keeps saying that Sakamoto is &quot;perfect&quot; and that actually comes out as a small detriment to this series as what LA was soo worried about this anime, since he&#039;s perfect, we&#039;ll know he&#039;ll always win in some bizarre way or another and LA will honestly say that not ALL of the skits in this anime will hit, mainly with &quot;Sakamoto vs. the delinquents&quot; skits comes off as bizarrely typical, where&#039;s it&#039;s comedy goldmine is when Sakamoto teams up with the delinquents (huh, double edged sword much?). <br />
<br />
Voice acting wise, well LA is gonna be honest here, Sakamoto&#039;s voice actor Hikaru Midorikawa is the utter ace in the voice cast (duhhh because he&#039;s the main character),but LA is such a sucker for almost all of Sakamoto&#039;s fangirls voice actors (Yukari Tamura, Kana Ueda, Yui Horie and LA&#039;s favorite from the fangirls Mai Nakahara).<br />
<br />
Animation wise, well Studio DEEN, if KonoSuba gave us ironically made animation but still made a great comedy, then Sakamoto desu ga, did a solid animation for a great comedy, everything from the aesthetics to character designs, animation...is something LA would praise it much like it&#039;s comedy.<br />
<br />
The ending gave something rather dramatic in for a slice of life comedy and....errrrrr...LA hate to admit it but *ahem* mood-whiplashing, however the ending stuck to it&#039;s typical flavour and bombastically weird execution that the ending was well a perfect end to the mysterious eponymous Sakamoto...........................he&#039;s an alien right?...RIGHT!??!?!?! <br />
<br />
Sakamoto desu ga? is another bright spot to Studio DEEN&#039;s catalog of great comedies of 2016 and with that it&#039;s utterly cool~ wouldn&#039;t you say Sakamoto?.
