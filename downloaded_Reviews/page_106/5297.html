    Nobody does an attack on a civilian population better than the Gundam franchise.<br />
<br />
The opening to this movie blew me away.  When a gigantic bullet casing, falling from a mecha&#039;s weapon, bounced off a lady&#039;s head on a street far below, causing her to fall over and die, I instantly gave this a 10.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of movie I was hoping Char&#039;s Counterattack would be.  A coherent and compelling movie charting everything we love about the Gundam franchise.  The horror and tragedy of war, the visceral action and drama, the complexity and ambiguities of ideologies, mecha blowing shit up.<br />
<br />
Char&amp;rsquo;s Counterattack had all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6880">
        that, but to me felt like you were tuning into a movie midway through; you were thrown into a situation that you weren&amp;rsquo;t introduced to properly.  It had too much plot machinations and not enough breathing space for characters, too many ideas and not enough execution.  F91 however does it all correctly.<br />
<br />
Yes, F91 is the outcome of a full TV series being cancelled midway through pre-production, and turned into a movie instead, but the movie does not reflect that at all.  It does not feel incomplete or flawed beyond redemption, it actually feels like a prologue to an epic 50 episode saga, one that we won&amp;rsquo;t mind missing out on because there&amp;rsquo;s too many ways they can end up generic and tiresome, much like the Gundam show F91 is the continuation of: Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ.<br />
<br />
The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that some of the scenes with the Crossbone Vanguard aristocracy are a bit too long and feel obligatory, but they&amp;rsquo;re still essential to understanding their motives, so they&amp;rsquo;re not a complete waste of time.  Obviously there&amp;rsquo;s no villain on par with Char Aznable, but it would be too much to expect one.<br />
<br />
Where this movie shines, and what we should focus on, is the attention to detail, like the aforementioned woman-killing gigantic bullet, the reimagining of the tropes of the genre that Mobile Suit Gundam introduced back in 1979, such as survivors of an attack forced to become soldiers, and the ambiguous motivations that spur men to want to kill millions of human beings for a greater good.<br />
<br />
Another negative thing about F91 is the total rip-off of the Empire Strikes Back bad guys theme.  I&#039;m not a SW geek so I don&amp;rsquo;t know the actual title, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably &#039;Imperial March&#039; or something.<br />
<br />
But other than these small nitpicks (and the fact that the MSG Random Slap ratio is pretty damn low) it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome movie with brilliant animation that puts A LOT of today&#039;s anime to shame.  And it hilariously keeps up another MSG tradition: stupid names for characters:  Seabook.<br />
<br />
It&amp;rsquo;s not the name of a prize-winning race horse.  It&amp;rsquo;s our main hero.<br />
<br />
Seabook.<br />
<br />
Remember it.  Remember F91, don&amp;rsquo;t let it get overshadowed by other Gundam shows, this one is an accomplishment.

    Ever wonder what happens when a fifty-episode series gets condensed to under two hours? The answer to that lies within Mobile Suit Gundam F91 -- a textbook example of wasted potential. Though F91&#039;s core story is a solid idea that draws plenty of inspiration from its predecessors, without any flesh on its narrative bones, F91 is reduced to an inconsistent and and very much rushed tale. However, boasting its nostalgic story along with great animation, F91 is still worth a look by fans of the gundam franchise.<br />
<br />
Due to disputes amongst the original production staff, this ill-fated chapter of the universal century gundam saga was cut

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13314">
        down in size in a rather extreme extent. F91 tells the tale of Seabook Arno and the crew of the Space Arc, a spaceship of civilians trying to escape the conflict between the Earth Federation and the Crossbone Vanguard, a faction led by the Ronah aristocratic family. As usual, the protagonist is forced into the cockpit of the gundam in amidst of the chaos and destruction on the civilian population and is bound there by his obligation to protect friends and family. While F91 certainly does not make new ground in the way of plot creativity, it does incorporate many of the key themes in the gundam franchise with great success. There are a number of solid lessons and morals to be learned in F91, and though there is very little originality amongst them, they provide the film with much-welcomed substance.<br />
<br />
However, after the first third of the film, the plot begins to lurch forward erratically. Viewers are expected to connect the dots in places where considerable lines of narrative have been truncated. Names, faces, places, and political intrigue are constantly thrown at the viewer and are gone before the viewer gets a chance to absorb them. The end product manages to be more or less coherent, but much of the plot is lost and damaged due to the lack of elaboration. Needless to say, this does not make for good entertainment.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the production value of F91 is that of a feature film rather than a TV series. Like other Gundam OVAs and films of its era, the action looks great -- arguably superior to the modern TV productions. The new generation of mobile suits (three decades past the technology of Char&#039;s Counterattack) have a number of new tricks, which makes for eye candy that will please most mecha fans.The 1991 character designs also hold up well to the test of time, though looks alone would not be able to veil the considerable flaws in characterization. Though Seabook Arno is a mature and charismatic gundam protagonist, due to the limited runtime and the large cast, most key characters are not very well developed, hence some of their actions they take seem incomprehensible. Thankfully, none of the characters manage to be obnoxious and repulsive. F91 is accompanied by a mediocre musical score that is sparingly used, though viewers will find a great theme song and plenty of classic sci-fi sound effects, for better or for worse.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a great story in F91 dying to get out -- a story forever lost to the squabbles of yesteryear. Chances are, if you&#039;re a gundam fan, you will leave Mobile Suit Gundam F91 satisfied to some degree under the laments of disappointment over its lost potential. If you are new to the gundam franchise, there are much better choices than F91 for your entry point into the metaseries. And if you&#039;re not a fan of gundam or mecha in general, F91 is not going to convince you otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pro:<br />
- Great animation<br />
- Gundam veterans will be able to appreciate the remains of the amputated plot<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
- Barely coherent<br />
- Underdeveloped characters<br />
- Bland musical score

    *Spoilers for Gundam F91*<br />
<br />
Potential is something that can be rather frustrating or even tragic when unfulfilled, depending on the circumstances. If nothing went wrong in terms of production and the product simply wastes its potential thanks to bad writing, it can be rather irritating. For better or for worse, Gundam F91, Yoshiyuki Tomino’s attempt at creating a new UC Gundam saga, is certainly the latter. It&#039;s like a rising college football player dying of CTE, with the victim being unable to tap into its potential for reasons far beyond its control. What was planned as a full 52 episode series reduced to a mere 13,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review252133">
        and those 13 being gutted to create a film that was clearly not meant to be one. It&#039;s ultimately not the movie&#039;s fault that it&#039;s bad, it was never meant to be one in the first place until executive meddling damned this project.<br />
<br />
Installments like this are a testament to the importance of pacing. Since the events of this movie were originally meant to be 13 episodes, it only makes sense that a lot of information and character/world-building would be taken out. Unfortunately, this is of huge detriment to the movie. I mean, starting your saga almost verbatim like the original and having other important similarities is already not much of a good thing, but when character progressions/decisions and deaths are unexplained or not explained well at all, that&#039;s when we have a problem. There are multiple emotional scenes in this movie such as the initial attack on the main cast’s homeland, the death of Seabook’s dad, and the reunion of Seabook and his mom, all of which don&#039;t leave nearly as much of an impact because the bad pacing didn&#039;t allow us to establish anything properly, giving us little time or reason to care before tragedy or even tear-inducing happiness strikes. <br />
<br />
There are other problems, some of which also involve cutting. The subplot about Cecily’s earrings goes absolutely nowhere since I think it probably would&#039;ve become more important later on if this were to have been the 4-cour series this was meant to be, at one point, they cut from the middle of a major battle to a scene way later where Seabook snuck out on his own (how and when did he do that, and where is the city he want back to in relation to the base he and his friends are at?) which raises a ton of problems, even aside from the ones above, since it&#039;s probably the worst and most unnecessary cut yet. There is no reason we couldn&#039;t have seen Seabook’s first major battle in full since it probably would&#039;ve only lasted a few more minutes. Did they really need this movie to not go past the two hour mark? If so, there were probably other ways to trim the movie down a bit more. The finale is ok and probably the most interesting part of this movie, but the ride to get there got gutted badly. Regardless, we’re not getting a more fleshed out retelling of this (or the rest of what Tomino wanted this to originally be), and that saddens me because this movie really needed to be the way it was intended for it to actually be good.<br />
<br />
As mentioned previously, part of the reason the characters aren&#039;t very good is that the pacing doesn&#039;t allow us to really get invested in them whatsoever, sullying a lot of the emotional impact behind the drama they face. When the introduction is a bunch of our protagonists bickering at each other, it&#039;s hard to really feel a sting when their homeland gets attacked, and when some of them die, not only is it not that impactful since we hardly get to establish a connection with these people before the attack that happens 5 minutes into the movie, but some of these guys we don&#039;t see until sometime into the attack, mere minutes before their death. The main villain is a typical royal imperial who doesn&#039;t remove his mask or have much of a personality, and the grandfather is only there for a few brief moments and is just a father who has to put on the royal guise of the Rohan family, but there’s hardly much to them. Like with the protagonists I’ll be mentioning, if they allowed this to be as it was intended, we probably could&#039;ve fleshed them out a bit more to make them more interesting.<br />
<br />
Seabook is basically another Amuro Ray in practically every sense of the word, including the fact that a parent of his left to work on the Gundam he would end up piloting by chance. Hell, his mom just appears in the movie with no introduction and then they bond but thanks to the aforementioned issues, it doesn&#039;t sell as well as it should. His sister is initially very perceptive of her mom’s true feelings and self for her age but then when she actually meets her she acts like her mom is not a good person, which is rather inconsistent. It&#039;s not like the former is realistic for a child but then to switch to the latter for no apparent reason other than their dad dying while escorting Seabook, is really jarring. Cecily is a princess character who hangs out with and sympathizes with the common people, enough so that she initially forsook the throne like her mother did and then did so again just to be with her friends after realizing that the Rohans are just as bad as ever. At least it&#039;s a fresh spin on a trope that would be as tired as a sloth. No other character is with really bringing up however, like the typical arrogant prince character, a girl who only switches to the good guy side because her master took interest in Cecily (why she has disdain for her, we&#039;ll never know), and her master who has a grudge against the Rohans and let&#039;s the good guys go in the end. I don&#039;t need to reiterate the potential lost for character building, do I? No? Ok, moving on.<br />
<br />
Much like Char&#039;s Counterattack, while the writing is lackluster at best, the visuals are some of the best not only in the franchise, but in its respective decade. The character designs look pretty appealing, the mech shading is great, and the action and animation is all very fluid and simply a wonder to look at. The sheer detail and fluidity is something to grasp at and all of this simply executed the best of what 90’s animation had to offer, even though it came out very early into that decade, and it looks even better than Char’s Counterattack, which already had some of the best-looking and most fluidly animated visuals of the 80’s. The mech designs look great as well, especially the F91 and the Vigna Gina (what a laughable name by the way). Even with everything bad I&#039;ve said about this film, at least it was able to look so gorgeous that to this day, it is still a top contender for the title of most well-animated Gundam anime. <br />
<br />
Another similarity between the two films is that the OST isn&#039;t that memorable. The OST for F91 is at least better than CCA&#039;s due to it sounding more cinematic. I also prefer this film&#039;s ED titled &quot;Eternal Wind&quot; to CCA&#039;s ED. It&#039;s a peaceful yet somewhat emotional track, though I do find it a bit odd that it sounds like it was recorded live instead of how songs usually sound in all non-live venues. Regardless, this is a decent OST for the movie.<br />
<br />
Bad pacing and cutting aside, this film feels rather milquetoast, minus the emotional scenes that invariably fail to strike a chord with me. The action was somewhat entertaining and well animated, and it was pretty cool to see all of the new developments in technology since the events of CCA (I especially love the laser flag) but overall, my experience felt rather meh, not even in a borderline zen way but like when you watch a show with your kids and feel nothing other than just “well this is a thing I&#039;m watching”. The fact that I have no real emotion at all during the film barring certain minor points really sells how ineffectual this film really is. It&#039;s basically a throwaway movie.<br />
<br />
This movie feels like the first special edition recap to a mediocre series we were robbed of. It&#039;s a real shame since this was supposed to be a grand and involved jumpstart of a new saga in the Universal Century timeline. We all know the story now, and I think it&#039;s really sad what happened here. Now, all we&#039;re left with is this unfortunately mediocre movie, regardless of how visually stunning it is. At the same time, what was presented here might not even be compelling if it went as planned. I&#039;m not sure if that hurts more or less than the idea that the material was at all promising. Well, with all that said, I think it&#039;s time to bury this one and hope for a revival. Either we hope for that or hope for an adaptation of the Crossbone manga.

    Story and Characters<br />
<br />
A new group, the Crossbones Vanguard conquer the Frontier IV colony in a surprise attack after years of peace. Caught in the crossfire is college student Seabook Arno, who sees many of his friends killed during the skirmish and discovers that his girlfriend Cecily Fairchild is actually Berah Ronah - heir to the Ronah family clan and the Crossones Vanguard. He then finds out that his mother is alive and has been working on a new mobile suit codenamed &amp;quot;Gundam Formula-91&amp;quot;. Seabook reluctantly pilots the Gundam at first, but slowly discovers the Newtype abilities within him and uses them and the Gundam to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6405">
        turn the tide of the war.  <br />
<br />
To be fair this was a lot of character development to try to squeeze into a movie and it isn&#039;t very well executed. Plot holes with Cecily&#039;s father abound, not to mention that most normal people wouldn&#039;t be able to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; the love story between Cecily and Seabook. Seabook is likeable but Cecily is a bit of a mess mentally and emotionally, having come from a very messed-up family. <br />
<br />
Overall there was a good story but the characters weren&#039;t developed very well and this could have been executed so much better than what was presented. I keep wondering how much better this could have been if it had just been expanded to a 10 or 12 episode series - there was certainly enough meat in the story to justify it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art/Animation and Sound<br />
<br />
Very old and dated. Didn&#039;t detract much from enjoyment of the story - the problems were inherently in character development, not in the animation and sound.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
<br />
I felt a little let down by this. The premise and set up were good, there was a lot of conflict built into both lead character&#039;s histories, which was fully exploited but didn&#039;t have as much emotional impact as expected because both lead characters just didn&#039;t &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; with each other the way you expect romantic leads to click.<br />

    Gundam F91 had its episode reduced from 53 to an OVA standard episodes because BANDAI at that time are low on budget and some of the staff are dying. And so, the release was delayed from 1989 to 1990&#039;s. But overall it has a great story and a nice music.

    At the end of Gundam F91, it implies there will be a follow-up series.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this never materialised. Which is a shame, because it&#039;s a good movie and would have made a good series.<br />
<br />
Because of these cuts, the movie is somewhat disjointed and incoherent, and certainly shouldn&#039;t be watched for an awesome plot. What it does do, however, is show off some nice mech designs, have a cool villain with a silly plan, and have awesome animation and art.<br />
<br />
The plot is fairly standard Gundam, with people from space, people from Earth and some other people from another patch of space fighting. Also Newtypes, who as fans

          <span style="display: none;" id="review22102">
        of the franchise know are sort of halfway between Bene Gesserit, Jedi and idiot-savants. The main antagonist is Iron Mask, who is unsurprisingly a man in a mask and whose plan doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense. It is nice, though, to have the Char analogue actually be a threatening and powerful villain.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is interesting, with some nice background music and an iffy ending song full of unneeded and badly pronounced English.<br />
<br />
However, it is the detail in the animation and the quality of the art which makes F91 really worth watching. The fights are excitingly choreographed, and the characters have the sort of attention to detail that reminds you of Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Macross: Do You Remember Love.<br />
<br />
To conclude, it&#039;s best to think of F91 as a &quot;tech demo.&quot; It&#039;s a one-off adventure that sort of works, but is mostly appealing due to its technical aspects.

    Oh boy, the weird one. Mobile Suit Gundam F91&#039;s production background is probably more well-known than the actual contents of the movie. Originally planned for a full-length series, vague reasons that were never really elaborated on halted Gundam F91&#039;s production after screenplays were written for a mere 13 episodes. Probably wanting to keep the Gundam brand strong, the decision was ultimately made to make what existed of the planned series into a single theatrical film. What resulted was the most universal reception of a Gundam series ever: that the movie was a very apparent hackjob of a story and ultimately not very satisfying. It&#039;s universal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review215222">
        to the point I have to agree on both of those accounts. But before that conclusion, let&#039;s take a more detailed than usual look of this nearly &quot;lost&quot; Gundam entry.<br />
<br />
In keeping with the mecha tradition of terrible names, a young man named Seabook Arno and his friends end up on a war ship after their space colony comes under attack by forces calling themselves the Crossbone Vanguard. It’s a mostly typical Gundam set-up and story. Seabook reluctantly fights but still finds the time to complain about adults, and the “brat pack” here is reminiscent of ZZ Gundam’s except they are thankfully far more resourceful and mature. In the movie’s beginning as the group attempts to escape from the colony war zone, it’s actually rather refreshing to see such a reasonable bunch of teenagers interacting with each other without going into fits over nothing or trying to sell each other out to the enemy, but I digress. It turns out Seabook’s childhood friend, Cecily Fairchild, is actually part of the Crossbone Vanguard’s royal family and through the typical cheap plot device of Newtype mind tricks ends up going along with them despite having no reason to do so (she’s practically a stranger to her real family). I also don’t see why the Vanguard put so much effort into retrieving her in the first place, as they reveal they don’t actually care much about the possibility of her dying despite their original plans to use her as a spokesperson for the commoners.<br />
<br />
And already I can’t ignore Gundam F91’s hackjob story construction. If you thought Tomino Gundam series were hard to follow before with the thinnest excuses possible for major character motivations, then F91 is just bewildering as a result of its editing. The script feels no better than if full episodes existed before the movie’s production were simply cut into snippets like one of the Gundam franchise’s many compilation movies. Scene transitions are extremely improper, with abrupt cuts and any establishing detail skipped over to save time. A sense of movement is often removed, which means you get scenes like characters flying around at the end of battles and suddenly they’re instantly back on the mothership without smoothly aiming the direction there first. There’s pretty much no character development because there’s no time, and the supporting cast from the beginning never gets to rise above background noise. Without scenes spent on characters deliberating or giving introspection to their choices, you end up with those same thin motivations as mentioned before to the depth of being transparent. In Gundam F91 a minor enemy character who is important to nothing in the larger plot makes the huge decision to defect after a five second scene that just barely implies she’s jealous of another pilot’s special treatment by her captain, and then five minutes after this she’s dead forever. In a movie struggling to save time, they give scenes to someone that doesn’t matter that amounts to no emotional payoff.<br />
<br />
Gundam F91 jumps all over the place like that which makes it a frustrating watch, because there’s enough here to make someone think it could’ve made a solid series. The writing (or at least what we get to see) comes across as more tolerable than some Tomino works. It’s relatively rare to see our characters make completely nonsensical choices and the whining about adults and “needing to understand each other” while blowing other people up is kept to a minimum this time around, although all of the usual Universal Century Gundam tropes do still exist. It’s one of the easier Gundam settings and casts to buy into, and what inhibits further investment isn’t immersion-breaking inane plot details like some series, but rather the lack of plot details entirely to greater establish that setting and its characters. The movie is still attempting to be a character drama, but there’s no breathing room for them to grow on you because the movie keeps shoving details about the actual war down your throat with little else. There’s still some top dollar Tomino dialogue (“When you had to stop breast feeding, your mother was hysterical”) but again, relatively speaking, the core of Gundam F91 is fairly solid and usually keeps its head out of the clouds.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the Crossbone Vanguard, I have no idea where they got their huge forces since they were apparently secretive rogues and it seems no one in the movie cares. They have a Zabi family-esque monarchy rulership and clearly want control over space, but any attempts to make them a little more interesting fail because of how unclear they are. They want to unify the colonies and stop Earth’s pollution and blah blah blah, but in one scene they’re ordering their troops not to harm colony civilians and in another they’re killing them indiscriminately with automatons. If there were reasons given for this and I missed them, it’s probably because they were established in one five second scene.<br />
<br />
The real head of the antagonist side is Cecily’s father, a man known primarily as “Iron Mask” due to the metal helmet he wears over his entire head (because his wife left him? What). Let’s cut to the chase: Iron Mask is Darth Vader. He is literally Darth Vader. The dub track makes him sound exactly like Darth Vader because they knew it too. Iron Mask also has a long black cape, and there’s literally a scene where he’s implied to have killed someone with Newtype mind tricks. And you know what? I don’t even care. This guy still has some of the most charisma out of any Gundam villain, because if you’re going to rip a villain off then Darth Vader is an extremely worthy candidate. Iron Mask may not amount to much by the end, but in a movie where no one does he’s at the very least [i]cool[/i], which works.<br />
<br />
The hilarious Star Wars knockoffs don’t even end there. The royal family structure and culture bears resemblance to that of Star Wars as well, even down to Cecily being Darth Vader’s daughter. And before you ask, no, Seabook is not related. One of the first songs played in Gundam F91 opens very similarly to the main Star Wars theme, and a later one is even more unmistakably a copy of the Imperial March theme. It’s downright uncanny. Return of the Jedi came out nearly 10 years before this movie, so why Gundam is copying it now and why they feel the need to when the original series debuted alongside Star Wars is as much of a mystery as anything concerning this movie’s production. On the subject of audio, the English dub is also a fairly high quality and practically a who’s-who of big 90s anime voice dubbers.<br />
<br />
Being a movie, the animation is extremely nice and the art looks like it came from a classic 70s Gundam series due to the return of franchise original, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. The fight choreography is tight, almost always large-scaled battles full of movement without frames getting too chaotic, and those just looking for quality Mobile Suit animation from this movie won’t be disappointed. Gundam F91 also possesses some of my favorite Mobile Suit designs of the franchise, courtesy of Kunio Ookawara. Gundam F91 takes place very late in the Universal Century timeline, and this distance is accentuated by the complete lack of Zakus (finally) and their replacement with Crossbone Vanguard’s grunt suits that have an unusual “gas mask” face and wield lances instead of sabers. There’s a subtle mystique to many of the Mobile Suit designs that make them look like a part of a distant culture, such as the F91’s shoulder “feathers” and the Vigna-Ghina’s back fins. It’s a change of pace from standard Gundam designs without what makes them unique being too over-the-top and ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Though it has more to offer than its reputation implies, Mobile Suit Gundam F91 is still ultimately just a well-produced, somewhat fun adventure that never has what it takes to be emotionally rewarding. For a two hour romp it’s worth the time to UC fans as it possesses enough of the attitude that made those longer series endearing. It’s a shame that the reunion of the original Gundam series’s team was prevented from creating a more fruitful experience, because Gundam F91 seems to show there was enough of that skill still left in them. In the end, this movie that doesn’t even have a real conclusion might be all we have for a long time, and it’s still somehow more enjoyable than some 50 episode Gundam series.

    I think I don’t even need to explain the background for this movie, but in case you’re a newbie that needs things explained to you: Gundam F91 was originally going to be a full length series. However Sunrise, deciding to be assholes, denied Tomino that wish and told him to make a movie instead. However, instead of refitting that’s script for a movie, he just kinda awkwardly trimmed down whatever plot he already had for a movie’s length. Yare Yare Daze…<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
Now to be fair, in theory the plot doesn’t sound too bad. In fact, in concept it’s quite good. There’s just one problem: What the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308411">
        hell is going on!? Seriously, this movie is so fast paced it is almost incomprehensible, to the point I had to check the Gundam Wiki a couple of times to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. There’s also the problem that the plot is fundamentally basic. There is absolutely no depth to anything here.<br />
<br />
Like, seriously, for every interesting concept this film has, it barely has time to actually explore any of them. This wouldn’t be too bad, but as a result, the characters’ reasoning to do anything comes off as stupid, and ass pulls are plentiful (How many members of the cast are Newtypes by the time the film ends!?). Also, the violence in this movie was greatly unnecessary, yet the way its delivered is almost cartoony. It’s frankly kinda hilarious at points.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
As you would expect, the short runtime also means almost no one gets any focus. Seabook is… fine, I guess, but he’s just generic as hell. Same goes for everyone in this cast. They have next to nothing going for them and are just generally boring. I legitimately didn’t care much for these guys.<br />
<br />
The villains are equally boring, there’s nothing to them in particular, and overall, I just didn’t find them particularly threathening.<br />
<br />
The Animation:<br />
<br />
It’s the same as CCA. Moving on!<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
The F91 is admittedly really freaking cool. I mean, the thing can create freaking afterimages, and they’re used in a very creative way. Can’t say much about every other mecha, but I don’t remember disliking any of them.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
I will admit the soundtrack is pretty good, with quite a few memorable tracks. Also, the main themes of the movie “Eternal Wind” and “The Time I’m Seeing You” are both quite nice. It’s not as good as CCA’s score, but I did like it.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
The cast is clearly trying, but they aren’t really allowed to do anything with their characters. Weirdly enough, the Late Great Tsujitani Koji yet again plays a main character, and while I do like him, he’s better off as Bernie, though ironically his reprisal of Seabook in Super Robot Wars X would end up being his final role. Aside from him there’s also Touma Yumi, Kusao Takeshi, Yoshida Konami, Koyasu Takehito (His first Gundam role before he became a mainstay of the franchise through Wing), Ikura Kazue and Yanada Kioyuki.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I know I didn’t seem to enthusiastic, but that’s because there’s barely anything to this movie. It is borderline incomprehensible at points, but aside from that it’s just “Meh”. To be fair, it did lead to the awesomeness that is Crossbone Gundam, but aside from that, this Pirate Treasure isn’t really worth it.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 4/10

    Gundam F91 is a decent movie. Chronologically, it is far into the future of MS Gundam, of the UC lore. I think its a mature addition to the series, and fairly enjoyable in terms of mecha action. More bellow.<br />
<br />
Story: the best part of the story is that it is set in the future, where all we know (MS Gunda, Zeta Gundam, etc) is old history, even the Newtypes are sort of a legend sometimes. This gets your attention right away. Another important aspect of the story is how mature it is. It is extremely centered on family struggles, relationships, and some war tragedy, it even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319648">
        has some strong scenes. The political aspects, however, are overall lame. They are another &quot;we defeated the empire, but someone is trying to do the same&quot;. Star Wars send its regards. Thus, you will be more rooked about the characters than the political aspects. Nevertheless, it is an entertaining story, where you want to understand what is going on. Imagine that you are seeing a mix of Zeta Gundam, with Gundam Wing.<br />
<br />
Art &amp; Sound: The art is absurdly awesome for 1991. The artwork is so damn good that the shows appear to be made in 2007 and transported to the past. I can`t say much about the soundtrack, because, in terms of music, nothing stands out.<br />
<br />
Characters: They are well made. They don`t act dumb or irrational, they are not overflown by lame romantical plots. All feels more natural and organic, like something that could have happened in real life, if all of these things were possible. The protagonists have particular stories and their own reasons to fight, which adds to their decisions and the overall lore of the anime. There is no annoying character, which is always a win, and the main villain is kind of cliche but works well.<br />
<br />
Mechas: Gundam F91 is a cool mecha. Some of its mechanics were the inspiration for Freedom`s arsenal (Gundam Seed), and clearly for Unicorn`s NTES (Gundam Unicorn). The NPC mechas, for me, are the most awesome NPC mechas of the franchise, surpassing even the Grazes (From Iron Blood Orphans), which were my favorites so far. They are like futuristic versions of the Zakus, but without the lame look they had.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a great movie. I think that one of the best Gundam movies of the Gundamverse, losing only to Stargazers (for me). Don`t miss out!

    Anyone in the Gundam fandom knows the infamous history of F91; it was a new series project by Tomino to be released in the early 90s, set a full thirty years after Char&#039;s Counterattack with a brand-new storyline and conflict, but due to production difficulties (it DID come out right after the Japanese economic crash) they had to scrap it all and put fifty episodes of content into two hours. So what did they do to turn it into a film? Cut the unimportant storylines and leave only the essentials? Reduce the character count and leave the focus on the dual protagonists Seabook and Cecily?

          <span style="display: none;" id="review279798">
        Or (the option they chose) just compress everything into such a rapid, non-stop pace that never stops for a breather just so it can fit everything into two hours?<br />
<br />
I had my complaints with Char&#039;s Counterattack feeling too fast-paced for me to keep up, but that was also a sequel playing off of long-established characters and a plot that felt like one constant final battle. F91 works, somehow, because it introduces an entirely new cast far-removed from any previous Gundam series or movie and goes through that entire story with rapid-fire intensity. It&#039;s somewhat grounded, the entire story taking place in just a couple space colonies, though of course the main villains plan to wipe out all life on Earth and the Moon because they&#039;re Space Nazis, so the stakes are high.<br />
<br />
Gundam Universal Century is very good about not going into power fantasy mode and keeping you stuck with the grim realities of war, and F91 may be one of the most brutal entries in the saga behind Thunderbolt and War in the Pocket. The opening battle shows the deaths of civilians, including children, and the main cast&#039;s home is essentially wiped out in the conflict as they try to escape. The pace is so fast you don&#039;t keep attention on the horrors unfolding, but just get thrown into the next one. With both the Earth Federation forces and the Crossbone Vanguard pirates morally gray, it&#039;s hard to root for any side and you mostly just hope the characters come out OK.<br />
<br />
With a story this fast, the characters are obviously underwritten, which is unfortunate. But the action and animation more than make up for it; Gundam has never looked better, and may never look better again because the series isn&#039;t popular enough to justify the budget anymore. Watching Char&#039;s Counterattack and F91 back-to-back, seeing the difference in animation quality between them is astounding, especially when you consider they were released only three years apart.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for high-octane sci-fi action, F91 has you covered. As long as you&#039;ve watched some of the previous UC Gundam series and are up to speed on some of its worldbuilding concepts (because this series has zero time to explain Newtypes or Minovsky particles to us), you&#039;ll probably be alright. Just make sure you&#039;re prepared for the ride.<br />
<br />
I may bump up the score for this one after a rewatch, because I feel that the letterboxed low-quality DVD I watched this on probably was not the optimal format to see it in; I&#039;ll try and scrounge for a blu-ray copy when I can.

    TL;DR: It&#039;s a better movie than Char&#039;s Counterattack. ...That&#039;s not saying much. Just watch the first 15-20 minutes.<br />
Ok, I&#039;m gonna skip the obvious parts that you&#039;ve probably already read in other reviews. This was meant to be a longer TV Show, we know.<br />
Actually, considering the facts this could&#039;ve turned out way worse. That doesn&#039;t mean is that good.<br />
I&#039;ll start with the negatives, and then I&#039;ll try to end on a more positive note.<br />
The story is very messy. Motivations are not clear and the villains are very cliché. Just your average &quot;hurr durr imma baddie i&#039;ll kill everyone&quot;. Pacing is also an issue. This suffers the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297273">
        same problem as CCA, where Tomino probably thought we would get bored if we didn&#039;t get a mech battle every 20 minutes or so. This obviously doesn&#039;t help in the structure. Instead of scalling up things to a climax, the final showdown just comes and plays out like every other fight in the movie. -pew pew, things blow up, mechs blow up, someone irrelevant dies.- <br />
The characters are also wildly underdeveloped. Instead of presenting a couple of secondary characters we&#039;ll get to know a little bit, Tomino loves throwing out 6+ characters that will barely get any line at all. There&#039;s a plus if there are very young children just because. I think this movie confirms my beliefs that Tomino isn&#039;t really a good writer/director.<br />
Now to the good parts.<br />
Even though they are underveloped, the characters are likeable. There was a point when I was wary of a character doing a stupid 180 like Quess Paraya in CCA, where a neutral character becomes friendos with the murderous genocidal baddies just &#039;cause. However that did not happen here. I was very happy about that. Maybe not having horrendous hateable characters that aren&#039;t meant to be that way is not much of a positive. But with Tomino, *ZZ and CCA flashbacks* you can&#039;t take that for granted.<br />
Now for the real compliments. I have two. This has one of the best animation cuts in all of the Gundam series. There were moments where i could swear they were rotoscoping everything, but then you notice some details and you know everything was done traditionally. The attention to detail is amazing. Something as simple as showing the hand of a Mobile Suit malfunctioning and spinning around like crazy just adds so much and grounds the film in reality so good in many moments.<br />
<br />
And my biggest compliment:<br />
Damn.<br />
What a great opening sequence. Even if you don&#039;t want to see the movie after reading this review, do a favor to yourself and watch the first 15-20 minutes. I think this is the most horrendous and gut-wrenching depiction of war that doesn&#039;t resort to very graphic and explicit imagery. I felt genuinely disgusted at myself for watching these scenes as part of &quot;entertainment&quot;.<br />
A plus: Apparently the story and the characters get really fleshed out in the manga Crossbone Gundam. I have not read it myself, however i&#039;ve heard it&#039;s quite good.<br />

    This turned out pretty well, considering that it was originally meant to be a TV series and ended up being chopped down to a two-hour movie. The fingerprints of that origin are all over it, from the overwhelming number of characters thrown on screen with nary an introduction, to the somewhat choppy structure that struggles to gel as it trims the connective tissue between scenes to an absolute minimum. Those problems have been known to plague 50-episode Tomino shows though, so it&#039;s something any veteran UC Gundam viewer should be used to. Despite that, I enjoyed F91 a lot more than Tomino&#039;s other Gundam feature,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review401906">
        Char&#039;s Counterattack, mainly thanks to the absence of any distractingly awful characters like Quess. While its ending leaves some major conflicts unresolved, it&#039;s more cathartic and comprehensible than the messy ending of Char&#039;s Counterattack.<br />
<br />
The other thing F91 has going for it is its stellar mech animation. The various battle scenes are jaw-dropping, with those happening inside colonies being particularly visceral. You don&#039;t want to be a civilian in this movie; it was clearly made while Tomino was still in a dark place emotionally.<br />
<br />
Overall, while you can see the duct tape holding the editing of this movie together, it brute forces its way to being an entertaining two-hour feature with solid execution of the classic Gundam formula and a host of memorable action scenes.

    This is a weird movie - because it was originally designed and partially produced as a 50 episode series. For what it is, I do think the movie stands fine, because it has problems while still being exceptional about certain things.<br />
<br />
For me, an important aspect for the mecha genre are the action sequences, and F91 has gorgeous animation with very unique and interesting mech designs. The fighting is fun to watch and doesn&#039;t clash with the non-action scenes visually. There aren&#039;t many, if any, scenes I recall looking off or grotesque due to little time spent on it. <br />
<br />
It stands pretty alone in the Universal

          <span style="display: none;" id="review178866">
        Century, the most expansive era in Gundam, so you can watch it without needing to know much of anything about the franchise. That said, it follows the most generic outline for a Gundam story it could have, but the differences are rather interesting for fans of the franchise, and knowing what follows in manga format and was meant to be fleshed out actually makes the movie more entertaining. <br />
<br />
This applies to the characters as well - they are fairly generic and knowing about them through close attention to the movie and the rest of the universe fleshes them out more than the movie will.<br />
<br />
Being a 50-episode anime turned singular movie (Gundam series tend to be condensed into 3 movies), it obviously has major pacing issues. Little is explained straightforwardly, which while not bad, is very difficult to catch onto when casually watching and is fairly critical since scenes of character development can near instantly turn to the start of action when they felt like they should have been naturally longer. I&#039;d judge this less if it weren&#039;t a politically driven movie in-universe, and the politics of the world and reasonings of major characters are very difficult to understand.<br />
<br />
The audio effects aren&#039;t bad, but for some reason I feel like some of them aren&#039;t entirely fitting. The soundtrack, save for a few select songs, is forgettable and generic.<br />
<br />
It has some wonderful parts in the animation and a few songs, horrible pacing and development of the characters and the situation in the movie, and is decent in all other regards. It is a movie that is prettier to look at and imagine what it could&#039;ve been than it is to listen to and understand fully.
