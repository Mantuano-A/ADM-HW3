    First episode:<br />
Oh no, no more football. Oh no, my mother died. Guess I have to play football because she&#039;s dead.<br />
Let&#039;s also add a chinese man with slanted eyes and he also does kungfu. A guy that says gosu in every sentence because, uh, unique speech pattern. The dude also scrubs a good wall. Oh and that chinese looking fella boyo, key man, I guess? Maybe he is the leader of the kungfu tribe where these weird chinese coach that uses emojis is part of, at this point I am just saying stupid shit because the review needs to be longer.<br />
What can I say I fuckin

    I am a big fan of the original Inazuma Eleven series. While it wasn&#039;t a masterpiece by any means it was still a great anime that I really liked. The story while predictable at times was engaging and entertaining to watch.<br />
<br />
The characters were for the most part great and well written, the visuals while not being great had its own charm and style and the soundtrack while a bit repetitive at times was great. It is a show I loved and to this day I hold it on high regard.<br />
<br />
Then, we have the Inazuma Eleven GO saga and while it was pretty good it had

          <span style="display: none;" id="review319770">
        its fare share of problems especially when you into Inazuma Eleven GO Galaxy where things got bizarre.<br />
When I heard that Inazuma Eleven is coming back in full force I was really excited because it has been 4 years since the final episode of Inazuma Eleven GO Galaxy aired. I thought the alternative setting of the show would be the series back to its great routes in a different way. I thought Inazuma Eleven Ares is going to be one of the best animes of 2018. Sadly Inazuma Eleven Ares was not one of the best animes of 2018. Inazuma Eleven Ares is easily the single most disappointing anime of 2018.<br />
<br />
Where do I even begin with this fan-fiction mess.<br />
For starters, we don&#039;t see the Inakuni Raimon team train at all but yet as the series progresses we just see them unlocking and mastering overpowered hissatsus right out of the gate. This alone created some serious plotholes and plot contrivance that at various time damages the narrative. I know the Inazuma Eleven were not the best in the narrative directing but some of the stuff that happens here is downright unacceptable even for Inazuma Eleven standards.<br />
<br />
For example, where did Iwato even learn the hissatsu technique call the wall. There&#039;s no flashback of him practising to that hissatsu technique he just mastered the hissatsu out of fin air.<br />
<br />
Next up the pacing especially in the first episode. I will admit the original series and the GO saga did not have great pacing either but least these two did a pretty good at establishing it&#039;s setting, tone and character. Here they did the exact opposite.<br />
The first episode is nothing but a series of emotional manipulation for the main protagonist who not only he loses his soccer team, but he loses his mother due to an illness. I honestly don&#039;t like when a show starts like this because it just feels like a cheap way to make the audience feel bad for set main character that we barely even know yet. When I saw the first episode for the first episode I did not care about Austo struggle because all events were so rushed.<br />
<br />
What made this even worse is that the show doesn&#039;t give Austo to probably grief as after he cried in the hill about his mother died a couple of scenes later we him perfectly fine and happy like nothing has happened.<br />
We don&#039;t see him baring his own mother, nor we see him grief alongside with his friends we just see him behave a happy kid. What makes this worse it the directing where in one Asuto is a happy and cheerful kid however what the plot decided to talk about Asuto&#039;s mother he literally goes full crybaby at times emo on the viewer. This is poor directing at its finest.<br />
<br />
Another case of this show messy direction is how almost every single match gets interrupted by sudden flashbacks where the show tries to develop it&#039;s quote new &quot;characters&quot; but the most part it failed miserably due to how uninteresting the new characters were.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#039;t help the fact the three main characters are all forwards instead of being a different soccer role killing the show variety.<br />
<br />
Another problem with Inazuma Eleven Ares is the new characters absolutely have no character chemistry.<br />
<br />
A couple of new characters in the show were inspired by certain old characters, but they really don&#039;t interact with each other. This alone crated a chunk of plotholes where the series does a poor job at explaining of how certain new characters were able to know the old ones.<br />
Speaking of plotholes the amount of plotholes in this show is insane in even for Inazuma Eleven standards.<br />
<br />
Where did Austo mother get burial othe Island?<br />
<br />
Why did Kazemaru decided to become a spy?<br />
<br />
How did Kagayama escape from prison?<br />
<br />
How did some of the new charterers learn new hissatsus?<br />
<br />
Who is the person controlling the Ares programme?<br />
<br />
I could go on and on.<br />
The worst thing about Inazuma Eleven Ares is that is so god repetitive. Almost every single episode has a random soccer matches. There&#039;s hardly any down time all as the series just want to get back into the soccer matches and it ultimately kills all potential character development.<br />
<br />
Before I talk about the old characters that we all know and love from the original series let&#039;s go over the new characters first because I have a lot of complaints.<br />
<br />
First, we have Asuto. I really tried to like him but direction and pacing of the series completely ruin him to a point where it only ends up being an unlikable and annoying character for the first half. His motivation of playing the sport it dumb as he wants to play soccer because his dying mother said so. This is just stupid anyone can write such a script. Asuto doesn&#039;t develop well all that much as he still is the same annoying kid from episode 1 and his interactions towards the other characters feel so stuff and unnatural.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s not forget that his an overpowered player who learns some of the most powerful hissatsus even though we don&#039;t see him train for shit. In many ways Asuto is no different to Kirito in Sword Art Online where he unlocks some of the most powerful skills, weapons and abilities in the games that he plays.<br />
What a waste of a character if I ever think of one.<br />
<br />
Next, we have Ryouhei. Ryouhei is a pretty good character and easily more interesting and than Asuto. I really enjoyed how Ryouhei uses football as a tool of revenge as he tries only beat Nosaka but the whole ares system and his reasoning overall fill justified as we can sympathise with him thanks to he&#039;s well-told backstory.<br />
<br />
Now we have Nosaka who is by far the best character in the show. Unlike Austo and Ryouhei he&#039;s the character that I enjoyed on a emotional level. He has a pretty solid backstory where before the events of the series he was diagnosed with a brain tumour where he only has 3 months to live before he dies. The show also a pretty job at making Nosaka a pretty sympathetic character where we know the full existent of his backstory and motivation of playing Ares programme?<br />
<br />
Now with Nosaka out of the way let&#039;s talk about the weakest characters on Inazuma Eleven. the New Ramion team. They are just a bunch of Mary sues who not only don&#039;t develop for shit but they are incredibly bland and unoriginal to a point they can put you to sleep.<br />
Honestly the only other character that is even noteworthy is Hiuru aka Kazemaru 2.0 who had the potential to be good but the pacing and fanfic writing completely ruins him.<br />
<br />
Now with the new characters done with let&#039;s talk about the returning characters.<br />
Now if you thought the new characters were bad enough you ain&#039;t seen nothing yet. While the new characters were mostly a bunch of empty shells avoid with personality.<br />
<br />
Endou for example went from being a charming, passionate soccer freak to this one dimensional kid who likes to yell a lot.<br />
The character that got the worst treatment is my favourite Inazuma Eleven character Kazemaru.<br />
What a way to kill a character that I adored. In the original series he was a friendly competitive guy who love to face off strong opponents in Ariesto this dark, soulless and one dimensional spy who barely did anything.<br />
 <br />
Inazuma Eleven Ares visuals were underwhelming even for Inazuma Eleven standards.<br />
The one thing that I didn&#039;t like is how it tried to look too modern by being up to date with the current sport anime but it completely backfired itself as the show can be pretty rough to look at.<br />
<br />
The character designs in Inazuma Eleven Ares range from okay to terrible as many of the characters designs in this show feels like the animation staff took rejected characters designs from the original series and Go and decided to put them in this series and it really shows.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t mention any of the characters but if you&#039;re a Inazuma Eleven fan such as myself you can easily tell of which character designs that the animation staff decided to scrap while making the original and Go series.<br />
The animation in Inazuma Eleven Ares is below average. I will admit that the original series wasn&#039;t the best when it comes to animation but least it had it unique flare that prevent it looking dated. Ares animation on the other hand felt like it was done without a second thought.<br />
The soccer matches in Inazuma Eleven were dreadful because not they ridiculously predictable but the matches themselves feel stiff, uninspired.<br />
<br />
I have never seen Inazuma Eleven soccer matches this lifeless and lazy. It honestly makes me want to turn off my computer due to how boring they are, It is almost as bad as Megalo Box boxing matches am not even joking. The worst thing about the animation is the hissatsu. The hissatsu were meant to be this special skill for each player to use in a match. However, the way the hissatus are portrayed in Ares is horrible. Some of the hissatus feel like they came straight from Dragon Ball Z.<br />
Some of the hissatsu were so bad it can literally piss off anyone inducing Inazuma eleven fans. When I saw Fire Lemonade in the last episode of the series I wanted to slam my head on a solid wall because who thought that having a hissatsu like that was a good idea.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack of Inazuma Eleven Ares underwhelming at best.  I don&#039;t mean the old track from the original series as it still great as ever the problem the new track is very dull and lifeless.<br />
The same thing can apply for the opening theme Teppen e Dash!  by pugcat&#039;s which is a generic kid&#039;s opening theme that barely has any energy put to it.<br />
The ending theme Koisuru Otome wa Amemoyou by alom is a mediocre ending theme.<br />
The voice acting thankfully is still pretty good overall as you expect. Not much to comment.<br />
<br />
Inazuma Eleven Ares is one of the most disappointing animes I have ever seen in a long while.<br />
After waiting 4 years for a new Inazuma Eleven I felt insulted of what I got.<br />
The story is poorly directed mess that is filled with plot holes and conveniences. The characters for the most part were subpar and uninteresting thanks to the shows fanatic writing. The visuals were at best underwhelming and the soundtrack is lifeless.  Unless you&#039;re  into bad fanatics I strongly recommended especially Inazuma Eleven fans to avoid this show at all cost because this series is ultimately not worth the wait at all as it will only disappoint you.

    Ares no Tenbin is an incredibly strong comeback for the series. <br />
<br />
A lot of the context for this review is back in my Inazuma Eleven Reloaded review, so don’t forget to check that one out too.<br />
<br />
The series mainly revolves around Inanuki Raimon, a team of transfer students that have been brought in the replace the separated Raimon. As far as standout characters go, none of them really do, it’s always been one of the curses of the series where the characters from the first part of any iteration are destined to be replaced for more likable and established characters as it goes on. One thing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290252">
        this team has going for it is their head coach, Zhao Jin Yun, Inazuma Eleven has mainly relied on having hardass serious coaches who usually have a reason behind their harsh methods, this man breaks this tired tradition by having a weird and interesting backstory involving him mastering a bunch of sports, being comedically aloof and teaching using things like drawing parallels with soccer strategies to confessing your love to a girl for example, he always manages to match every match feel fresh in regards to how Inanuki Raimon plays and is key to making their fast improvement feel very believable.<br />
<br />
The real draw to the series really is in the opponents they face and the ones they set up to eventually join Inazuma Japan in the next Orion anime. After the first few couple of matches, excluding the ones involving Haizaki, Ares hits its stride and has powerful character arcs in every single match, in a sense, the opposing team ends up feeling more like the main characters than Raimon do, some of the already existing characters have their arcs fast forwarded while others have been fundamentally altered but still stay interesting in their own way. While not absolutely necessary, Outer Code is definitely something that should be watched as a supplement to Ares, it does a good job of hinting at what sort of dilemmas some characters will face and how the dynamics have been altered because of the retcon.<br />
<br />
Haizaki is arguably more of a main character than even Asuto, his development is something that lasts both cours, essentially revolving around coming to like soccer even though he has only been using it as a tool to get revenge on Nosaka and the Ares no Tenbin system. What starts off as a self absorbed madman turns into an inner struggle over the idea of motive, meeting his arch-rival plants the idea of soccer being something he does because he actually likes it and the viewer gets to witness it slowly grow as he faces people with stronger convictions and as he starts to wonder what being strong even means, it all comes to a head at the final match of the first season where decides to face all these thoughts head on, making it an powerful climax purely through all the new characters its featured.<br />
<br />
Though not given as much weight and attention as some of the other antagonists, Kidou and Gouenji play their role as those who help the new set of characters find themselves really well, how the former easily earns the trust of his new team and the way he leads Haizaki and the way the latter helps an Inanuki player find his true calling as striker re-establishes them for a new generation of fans, one’s way of strategically drawing out the best of his teammates and the other’s seemingly unbreakable confidence in himself and his skills sell why they’re going to be key members in the new national team so well.<br />
<br />
Afuro might have very little impact in terms of plot, but he does embody makes this show incredibly valuable to the franchise, after his crushing loss to Endou, he has a conversation with an old lady over the nature of his self-proclaimed godhood and where he went wrong in the way he viewed soccer, through it, gives him a reason for his metaphorical rebirth that the original show never gave him, which he carries into the match against Inanuki Raimon. The match ends up being one of the most unique ones thematically, where it’s the main characters who end up being taught something important rather than the ones they face. Zeus, by extension because of their captain, encapsulate how revolutionizes everything: in the same way it did it with Afuro, Ares is meant to shorten arcs and make characters relevant in ways they weren’t before, yet still keep the core of what made them so special, like Aphrodite becoming a compelling figure who learns that caring for others is what makes him who he is and why he has so much fun.<br />
<br />
The Fubuki twins were another interesting aspect of the series, the rumored unbeatable duo was mainly used to convey how they can always improve through the help of others. Atsuya initially only relies on Shirou, having very little communication going on with his other teammates, works with Nae to bring out her hidden potential and, in turn, his too, symbolized with the already powerful Double White Impact being upgraded to Triple Blizzard by her lending a hand. In essence, it keeps the core theme of drawing the best out of someone that the character of Fubuki is known for, but adapts it to make use of multiple characters with just a couple of episodes instead of making something with a long tragic backstory that requires multiple tries and a heavy dose of angst.<br />
<br />
Tatsuya and Hiroto are arguably the best set of characters in the whole season, they have the most thought put behind their backstories, the attention to detail regarding their plays and presentation, their difference in personality. Tatsuya, formerly known as Hiroto until the retcon, has been affected the most out of anyone because of the changes, he no longer has to carry the burden of trying to be someone else, symbolized by his Ryuusei Blade not looking like The Explosion does, rather his dilemma is now trying to pull that person along with him until they&#039;re ready to run on their own. He’s still the earnest kind-hearted character he’s always been, but seeing more of him as a captain than we ever had makes him so much more than that cool dude who came back as a friend in the original Inazuma Eleven, it makes everyone from the orphanage putting their trust in him and why they rely on his presence so much understandable and something to empathize with. Hiroto, formerly known as that one kid who died, has an arc that mostly boils down to being very similar to Haizaki’s, the differences in how they’re handled is what makes it engaging. Once all is said and done, their conflict resolving results in the best moment from the whole run of the show, Hiroto learning his dad’s always cared about him in his own way and him willing to work with Tatsuya to fire off Cosmic Blaster, the best looking cut of animation in all the 26 episodes. Out of any of the characters featured in Ares, they are the ones who have seemingly reached the clearest starting line when it comes to their dream, so what they can possibly offer in Orion is nothing short of exciting.<br />
<br />
Endou is the 2nd best thing this show has to offer, but only by very little. We’ve seen him as the main protagonist, as a supporting teacher figure, and now as an antagonist, which he pulls off in such a great way. The match against Tonegawa Tousen was in essence very different from the other matches in the series: because many of the teams didn’t have defense as strong as their offence, most of the matches ended up with over half a dozen points being scored, though only 3 goals were scored in the match with Endou. Taking what has always been the main supporting pillar of morale for the entire series and turning him into someone who our protagonists have to overcome is something most franchises can’t really hope to get far enough to pull off, so him being used this way is surprisingly gratifying. While it may just seem like a simply cool move at first glance, Fuujin Raijin carries so much more weight thematically than it seems, prior to Ares, Endou had followed his grandfather’s teachings until he was pushed to come up with Ijigen the Hand in the FFI arc, but the changes here manage to circumvent that and justify it too, Endou faced one of the best players in the world and felt the weight of it firsthand, so him wanting to come up with a power capable of going up against that is what makes that move feel so heavy, it’s him acknowledging his place as one of Japan’s representatives and how much harder he’ll have to push himself to catch up, also acknowledging his status as legend, both in universe and arguably in a meta-narrative sense too. Although not the match I’d consider the best, it’s great to see him back this way.<br />
<br />
With this season making so many interesting protagonists to follow, Orion no Kokuin already has so much going for it, hopefully it manages to make use of them. Even if it doesn’t this season alone has been a wonderful set of gripping personal matches that showcased a bunch of varying and nuanced views about what makes soccer fun and the mindsets one can have to improve. I’m really glad Inazuma Eleven is still something I can look forward to even after all these years.

    After the questionable Aliea Academy arc from the original Inazuma Eleven and after the Inazuma Eleven Go series that felt like getting the bad ending of a video game, Inazuma Eleven Ares feels like replaying the game and getting the good ending.<br />
<br />
Story 8/10<br />
The story is similar to the first arc of the original Inazuma Eleven, where you have a new inexperienced football team that joins a tournament that has more at stake than a trophy. And here comes Midouin Munetada. He is an absolute exact copy of Kageyama Reiji except the fact that the story doesent follow him in such a mysterious manner like the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374172">
        original did with Reiji. The first episode is a little confusing with a lot of new characters being introduced as well as the football field being demolished and some other things i wont spoil, but after that the story goes smoothly, in a nice peace.<br />
<br />
Art 8/10<br />
The art is good, i like the colorful pallet as well as the more tall and mature looking characters, because in Inazuma Eleven and Inazuma Eleven GO even though the characters are 1 year younger, they look like they are 13 and not 16, so most of the characters look more realistic this time. The animation is smooth there is no annoying CGI, the only problem is the new hissatsus(superpower moves if you havent watch the original Inazuma Eleven) animations, they lack the spirit of the original ones, but are not half bad either.<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
The op and ending are very good, good enough to put them in my anime songs playlist, the voice actors are good as well and the background music is fitting, but i wouldnt call any of them a masterpiece. <br />
<br />
Characters 8/10<br />
About the characters, Inazuma Eleven Ares introduces a lot of very good, interesting characters like Nosaka Yuuma aka The Emperor of The Field, 	Haizaki Ryouhei aka The Devil of the Pitch and more, but in the same time we have the entire new Raimon Jr team, that lacks any personality. In 27 episodes in the first Arc of the original Inazuma Eleven, we learned a lot about almost every team member, so that in the end we know and care about everyone of them, but Inazuma Eleven Ares seemed focused only on a few good characters while disregarding the others. This might not be so bad because, for that small amount of characters we are able to dive deeper into their personalities then we could have if all the characters where  properly introduced. <br />
Inamori Asuto is the only exception. He is the main character so of course he has a lot of screentime but that doesent make him a good protagonist. All the fans around the globe agree that Inamori Asuto is the worst Inazuma Eleven protagonist. Why? Because he is an exact copy of Endou Mamoru. Even Tenma from the hated Go series was better because even though he was similar to Endou he had different circumstances and problems while Asuto deals with the exact same things as Endou and solves them in the exact way(convincing the team to play in the tournament, convincing the director of the school to support them etc.). He has the same circumstances as him, he speaks like him and that makes him boring considering the fact that Endou is in Inazuma Eleven Ares as well. That doesen mean that Asuto is the worst character ever, he is better than the unknown Raimon Jr team, but he is just uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 9/10<br />
I was able to have a lot of fun watching Inazuma Eleven Ares, I liked the few new good characters, and seeing the old characters in a different hypostasis was interesting.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Inazuma Eleven Ares does not get the popularity that it deserves probably because of the horrible Go series that made the fans quit the anime. I tell you to give this one a try at least because there are no more weird Avatars Space Trains, football pitches with traps and stuff. Just the normal classic hissatsus form the OG. Even if you havent watched the original Inazuma Eleven you can watch this series alone.

    I will preface this by saying that I love Inazuma Eleven. It is one of my all-time favorite anime, so I was really upset when they announced its end after Galaxy (or, well, after the Dream Match, technically). When I heard that this franchise would come back to us in 2018 really got my hopes up. And... maybe I got my hopes up a bit too much.<br />
<br />
I will also have to reference the other Inazuma Eleven series leading up to Ares in this review to bring my point across.<br />
<br />
Story (5/10) - What can I say here? It&#039;s typical Inazuma Eleven, so the story is what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review318825">
        you would expect. I will give credit where credit is due: the writers were being very ambitious with Ares (or what Ares should have been), and I will respect them for trying. The execution, however, was quite the mess with the story&#039;s pacing being its most notable flaw in my opinion. One of the things that I found annoying in the original Inazuma (and this includes GO and its three installments) was how much time was shown in between the matches. I think somebody in the higher-ups heard me as they adjusted Ares no Tenbin quite readily; more prominently so in the later episodes of this season, we can see that they throw all the &quot;between match&quot; content out the window to try and focus on the matches themselves. And that is a really big missed opportunity as that left the aftertaste of it being severely rushed.<br />
<br />
Art (6/10) - This is somewhat of a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, I do enjoy the (re)designs of most of the Hissatsu Techniques here. They&#039;re flashy, they&#039;re over-the-top, and while I understand that it might not be everybody&#039;s cup of tea I do find that these redesigns increased the technique&#039;s presence on the field. On the other hand, I am not that big of a fan of the designs of the characters,  most notably the returning characters from the original Inazuma Eleven. But since I like the art of the techniques more than I dislike the design of the characters... it gets a 6 here.<br />
<br />
Sound (7/10) - So, fun fact: the two groups that did the OP/ED of the original Inazuma Eleven (T-Pistonz+KMC and Berryz Koubou) actually disbanded (or went on an indefinite hiatus) in that blank period between Galaxy and Ares. I was quite worried at first how they would do, but indirectly bringing T-Pistonz+KMC back in the form of pugcat&#039;s did result in a nice OP at least.<br />
<br />
Character (5/10) - Okay, so here&#039;s the big issue with Ares that you will also hear me talk about when I write my review on Orion right after this: there are too many characters. The whole premise of Ares was to introduce a new team and get them to fight up the ladder against other teams led by the original, returning characters... but that ends up having the new Raimon, the old Raimon, and all the central players of the other teams. In short, there are too many characters for the anime to focus on all of them which results in very minimal (if any at all) character growth for any character that are not the main characters. And while I am normally okay with the non-main characters to not receive a lot of character growth, we even see the returning main characters not receive a lot of it themselves. And that&#039;s the big issue... the only thing that is keeping this up is for the nostalgia factor brought by the returning characters from Inazuma Eleven and that those characters who did get character focus received a substantial amount of it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (5/10) - I am going to be blunt here: in the first couple of episodes I was watching this with the hopes that I could enjoy a later episode. Having watched it and even having re-watched it to remember some details, I can say that I enjoyed Ares... but I have to make a conscious effort to ignore the things I dislike about it when doing so.<br />
<br />
Overall (6/10) - The biggest thing that Ares has going for it is the nostalgia. If you watch Ares no Tenbin for the sake of reliving your childhood and meeting the returning characters again, you will probably find joy out of this. But if you are going into Ares hoping and/or expecting that it will provide the depth needed to live up to any expectations, then... I am afraid Ares no Tenbin may not deliver.

    I’ve been a huge Inazuma Eleven fan since 2010, initially watching it on my own TV with the English dub, only to find the Japanese original later on Youtube. This show has been my staple, my starting point, my humble beginnings of anime, and it brings me so much joy to see it on air once again since the end of it’s last season (Inazuma Eleven GO Galaxy).<br />
<br />
So, what are my thoughts of Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin so far? This review has been posted since the airing of episode 13, and it will get updated later on as more episodes continue to air.<br />
<br />
Before we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review282585">
        move on to the review proper, I must explain to you all that the story of Ares takes place a year after the events of the Football Frontier arc of the original Inazuma Eleven, in an alternate timeline where the Aliea arc never happened (and the FFI arc as well) and certain characters are revived from the dead. Events of what had occurred in between the time of the Football Frontier arc of the original Inazuma Eleven series and Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin are explained with both Outer Code (a compilation of short videos that give us a glimpse of what happened to our beloved cast from the original series) and Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded, a retelling of the conclusion of the Football Frontier arc that will give way to the path of Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin. <br />
<br />
I highly recommend you watch both the Outer Code episodes and Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded before moving on to Ares no Tenbin, as it might be confusing for some people on why certain characters are here or there. I’ve seen a lot of people who start out with Ares already without watching both Outer Code and Reloaded, and they always end up confused about certain things.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, let’s move on right to the review!<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Art: 9<br />
Sound: 7<br />
Characters: 9<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
Overall: 8<br />
<br />
Story: As of 13 episodes, the story has been quite…interesting so far. I’m really intrigued about certain things and seeing how the characters have grown over time have touched me somehow. <br />
<br />
However, I feel like the story rushes at times and focuses too much on the soccer matches than the off-times of the characters. Off-times have been reduced to flashbacks instead and while it works sometimes, it sometimes doesn’t feel proper for others. I love watching the characters struggle in their training and trying their hardest to perfect a hissatsu or a play, but instead of seeing it happen in real time or even dedicate an episode on it, they’re nothing more than flashbacks and right after, we see the results of their training.<br />
<br />
I hope this will change (probably not) as we continue on with Ares, because their new formula on how to tell a story doesn’t often work out well for certain episodes, and it ends up feeling rushed in the end.<br />
<br />
Art: Oh I can’t even begin to tell you how much I’m digging the new artstyle that Inazuma Eleven is going for! It looks more clean and modern and bright, which is a really nice change! Animation is also different especially for certain hissatsus, and while the new animation of the old hissatsus I’ve seen before works, it sometimes doesn’t as well. <br />
<br />
I want to share examples on old hissatsus that don’t work with the new animation, but I think that comes down to personal tastes really.<br />
<br />
Sound: THE OPENING AND ENDING IS SO SO SO SO GOOD. I CAN’T STOP LISTENING TO IT. However, I feel like the OST of Ares doesn’t stand out much to me. The only time I remember the OST playing is in a certain event in Episode 6, but that’s it really. <br />
<br />
Characters: Related as well to my point previously about Ares rushing the story, this applies mainly to the character development, particularly the members of the Inakuni Raimon. <br />
<br />
In all honesty, I do love all of them. They’re good children who are doing their best, but I feel like their development is being rushed or isn’t highlighted so well, that it makes them feel…pale. <br />
<br />
Aside from that though, I do love all of the characters, especially Haizaki, who’s development to me stands out the most. He’s good, he’s interesting, and I can’t wait to see more of him later on!<br />
<br />
It also makes me happy to see the old characters in this series, and their development is interesting and very…brand new, as well. It’s interesting seeing how different their circumstances are, compared to how they were in the original Inazuma Eleven series.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Despite it’s flaws, I’m really enjoying Ares so much! Watching it is like taking a breath of fresh air, it’s different and new and really exciting. Seeing the old and new characters is so nice, and I’m excited to see how Ares will go on as more episodes air!<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Overall: Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin is good…not great, but it’s pretty good. It has it’s flaws but they don’t stand out so much, but hopefully they improve on it later on. Nonetheless, I’m sure fans old and new will find themselves to be enjoying Ares for what it is!<br />

    Inazuma eleven ares is a disappointment, the franchise of Inazuma eleven is not taken seriously, the development of the characters is bad, the death of the protagonist&#039;s mother at the end had no weight in the plot was only to feel sorry for him, the 3 main characters have flaws, the one who has it the most is undoubtedly Asuto being the poorest of the 3, Nosaka and Haisaki are much more decent, another big problem he has are the Hitassus taken from his sleeve, the last minute, although Whether in the original saga they had a reason or a story behind, here they only

          <span style="display: none;" id="review374902">
        appear with magic, many characters have almost no relevance and others are only to play the role of comedy, but even so they do not succeed, it is very difficult to connect with even if it is a character, although the soundtrack is one of the best of the inazuma saga, my conclusion is that ares is an anime that if you are not a fan of the inazuma saga I do not recommend it, but if you are a fan it is something decent.

    I watched all the Inazuma Eleven series so far, and I was super hyped for this one when it was announced. Even though I am much older than when I first started watching this show, Ares no Tenbin has not disappointed my expectations and I wholeheartedly enjoyed each episode so far.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The plot progresses quickly, unlike the previous series. Soccer matches and character interactions are not drawn out as they were in the previous seasons. As always, there is some shadowy force called Ares no Tenbin in the background and it is foreshadowed well in the first few episodes. The plot concerning Haizaki and his childhood

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298999">
        friend is also intriguing and keeps me waiting for the next episode. I liked the conclusion too as Nosaka&#039;s history is revealed near the end. The story is done well for a children&#039;s show, but one part of the story really made me cringe. <br />
<br />
In the first few minutes of episode 1, Inamori&#039;s mother dies and his soccer club is disbanded in the same day. It&#039;s ok though because the mother told him to love soccer so Inamori quickly moves past her death. Also, everything about Inamori&#039;s father makes no sense and I could not comprehend why the writers would fail so spectacularly in the area of Inamori&#039;s parents. Children would not really care about this point, but it completely disappointed me.<br />
<br />
Art + Sound:<br />
Characters look great. Old hissatsu wazas have new animations and they look gorgeous. The sound is a highlight of this show as always and combined with the art makes my hyped for every soccer match. Unfortunately near the end the art gets worse.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
Haizaki and Nosaka are great characters, and together with the coach make the show enjoyable. The coach is eccentric, but this show has portrayed him excellently, and I enjoy whenever he is there. Goujin was a surprise hit and I liked how he got quite a lot of limelight and was well developed too. We didn&#039;t get to see much of Endou, Kidou, and Gouenji, but when they appeared I really liked it. Inamori started off very awkward but he has development afterwards, but he doesn&#039;t get anywhere close to Tenma. I also dislike Inamori&#039;s motivation to play soccer, and the whole situation with his parents. Unfortunately, the story does not flesh out the other members of Raimon; they get one episode for character development and then are tossed aside. Hyped fights such as against Hakuren, Kira Orphanage, and Endou&#039;s team were a bit of a letdown too because we didn&#039;t like the characters as much. The managers are forgettable and not as memorable as the managers in past season, especially when compared to Aoi, Haruna, and Natsumi. <br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I enjoyed the first half well, but I didn&#039;t get as hyped for the latter matches. I still give this show an overall 8/10 because hissatsus were cool, some characters were very entertaining, and the overall plot with the Ares organization was well executed.

    An good recreation of the original series, I always loved Inazuma Eleven and will always give me an absurd nostalgia just to look at the characters, said that, I loved the way the players were presented in other team and with new teammates, this theme made the series kind of renew for me, unfortunately the games, which should be the most important part, they are rushed and solved in absurdly ridiculous ways, with some players making a goal without a hissatsu, which borders the ridiculous, considering that the best part of the anime are the special techniques of the characters, I would also like to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307442">
        see some more players with more emphasis, such as Atsuya&#039;s relationship with Shirou, anyway, good anime.

    this new inazuma eleven takes place in a parallel universe<br />
the new animation is really great the characters are interesting and also the storyline is also very good overall it is one of the best sports  i dont like that it is under rated and has a very low score<br />
i also like that the old hissatsu techniques used  have better animation and the method of execution has been changed and the best part is that the original inazuma eleven raimon characters are in different teams and fighting against each other in epic showdowns<br />
only the first 6 episodes have aired right now and i really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review280543">
        enjoy them also i like that for the first time the coach is hilarious and not a major downer like the rest also i like the characters design

    *Sigh* Inazuma Eleven. This anime started it all for me.<br />
The OG inazuma eleven was very good story wise, had good character development and i enjoyed it very much. Inazuma Eleven GO was getting mixed reviews. Never watched it till this day but i played the games so i know a bit about GO.<br />
Ares no Tenbin however... It has almost no character development or good story what so ever. Almost every episode is a match (not that i mind) but old enemies seem like shit. The characters really aren&#039;t good at football and the old team had struggles against Royal academy and Zeus JR and they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review284244">
        were like gods of football.<br />
Now those teams are getting defeated by a weak football team with only 1 or less hissatsu technique. Because its Inazuma Eleven and old characters keep returning, i keep watching it, but it just isn&#039;t nearly as good as the OG Inazuma Eleven.

    ok everyone says this but ima say it as well cos why not... I&#039;ve been a fan of inazuma eleven for quite a long time. The OG was amazing, the animation, even though I look at it now and it looks old and colourless, I find that it makes the whole thing look a lot better. From ep 1 right to when they win the ffi, I was hooked. Both the music (amazing btw) and the hissatsu techniques. Now this, this is basically.... the opposite of everything in the OG. The music, it&#039;s just the same ones, just used in the wrong places often. The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review289264">
        story... appalling af! Random death at the very beginning, a pathetic attempt to try and connect the viewer to the main character via sympathy. Speaking of main character. Ye ok endou/mark was super optimistic and used friendship to win a lot of things. But this MC is beyond stupid... there&#039;s a limit to how much optimism an MC can have, I say this MC has passed that limit. Now let&#039;s talk about the team, mainly the raimon team. At this point I feel like facepalming myself, the team has 0 skill, near to no hissatsu techniques and yet still manage to beat teams who are supposed to be the best in the country??? Let&#039;s  note here that when raimon beat Zeus junior in the OG they had a really nice arsenal of hissatsus, then the first match against royal was a forfeit which was a default win. But this isn&#039;t like that, they win solely off of plot armour, the coach and the... eleven band....???<br />
<br />
The eleven band is the next thing I&#039;m gonna talk about. This thing removes every ounce of what makes inazuma eleven interesting. I enjoyed the players thinking of tactics and deploying them by themselves. But this thing basically allows the coach to give them orders about when and where to use tactics. In fact i&#039;d go as far as to say, this thing is the only reason why the raimon team wins... no skill involved... just the coach (cos they have a genius caoch :/) giving them orders. But then all the other characters think the raimon team have some amazing skill...<br />
<br />
The matches are often interrupted by sudden flashbacks, this makes them feel slow and like they stretch on for far too long. None of the hissatsus are seen to be practiced on screen and instead it appears as a flashback. This happens pretty much every time throughout a match and it just gets repetitive and boring. Again I&#039;m gonna to refer to the OG and even the Go series, the team themselves thought of the hissatsus they want to do and practiced on their own accord to try and obtain their hissatsu. But in this... here comes the chinese coach who just gives orders to individual members and give them &quot;special training&quot;... *sigh*<br />
<br />
The opening theme is NOT good, the inazuma eleven series haven&#039;t rlly excelled in the whole opening thing so it&#039;s not really that big of a surprise to me. This doesn&#039;t do well either.<br />
<br />
The art and animation have completely went off the grid inazuma eleven wise. Losing the originality of the characters and making them seem more modern isn&#039;t the way to do I&#039;m afraid. The new animation isn&#039;t that amazing either. The fire tornado hissatsu animation being the main reason I say this. Take a look at the original, the flames burst out and yell &quot;HERE&#039;S AN OP MOVE!!&quot; But this has a literal black screen that keeps you from seeing those 2 seconds that matter in a fire tornado. Of course there are times when the animation is ok, such as the uzumaki the hand animation and all the emperor penguin moves. <br />
<br />
Character development is terrible and i&#039;d say there&#039;s hardly any of it, 17 episodes in and half the characters haven&#039;t been described and we haven&#039;t seen their true personality, so they all seem pretty much the same. <br />
<br />
This is getting too long so I&#039;ll end it here. Yes I&#039;m referring to the OG a lot and it may because I like it so much. The animation isn&#039;t that good, the art isn&#039;t that much better. Story seem a bit too generic and gets repetitive and boring, cos somehow a team with 0 skill beats teams who are supposed to be unbeatable. The OSTs haven&#039;t really been changed. Terrible character development, including a failed way to connect us to the main character right at the beginning. Solid 1 star rating, half if that was possible. I&#039;m only watching this too see how the original characters will turn out tbh :/

    I see all seasons of Inazuma Eleven (go / chrono stones / galaxy / and then ares no tenbin), I&#039;m a big fan of Inazuma Eleven, I grow up with this anim.<br />
<br />
But really, what is this anim ??? The story is really poor and to much similar to Inazuma Eleven, but the worst is the design ! Seriously is it a joke ? The design of new characters is really bad, too much simply... They look all same. <br />
<br />
This is the worst season of Inazuma Eleven ever...<br />
<br />
Story, 3/10 : The story is too similar as Inazuma Eleven<br />
<br />
Art, 2/10 : Please do an effort for give

          <span style="display: none;" id="review312598">
        a design correct !!! Characters design doesn&#039;t give envie to appreciate new characters... It gives the impression that it is sloppy<br />
<br />
Sound, 5/10 : op and ending are ok, I do not have much to say about them<br />
<br />
Character, 3/10 : The main character is very annoying, I&#039;m just happy to find old character of the first anim, but new character are really straightforward<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 3/10 : The design of the serie is to simple, so I can&#039;t appreciate corectly the season.. +1 point for old characters<br />
<br />
Overall 3/10 : I&#039;m really disappointed

    This is my first review, so I hope it&#039;s good enough.<br />
<br />
Before you watch this series, I suggest to watch Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded, the remake of the original series&#039; 27th episode. You can also watch Inazuma Eleven: Outer Code before or along with this series to learn the perspective of other teams in the series. With that said, I&#039;ll start my review.<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
The plot is set on a parallel timeline one year after the altered 27th episode. The story is somewhat boring, as there is basically no emphasis on the actual title, &quot;Ares no Tenbin&quot;.<br />
Simply put, this series just introduced a set of new characters and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review287488">
        remake of some the original characters, to play in Football Frontier. This could be good but the execution is quite bland.<br />
However, the series tried to make three perspectives along the Football Frontier, through the main characters Asuto, Haizaki, and Nosaka. I believe Haizaki and Nosaka were developed nicely, but Asuto was very underdeveloped. Unlike the original series&#039; core main Endou Mamoru, this series&#039; core main Inamori Asuto is not attachable. I decide to give the story 7/10.<br />
<br />
Art: 8/10<br />
The art of the series is different from the original series and the GO series, but still quite nice. I enjoyed the original art the best. I decide to give the art 8/10.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
The sound effects were nice and the both opening and the ending songs wasn&#039;t bad. The animation of the songs follow the usual stream of openings and endings of Inazuma Eleven series. I decide to give the sound 8/10.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
The characters... is what I want to discuss most. The Inakuni Raimon team character development is horrible. You don&#039;t feel attached like the original series to just Asuto, but the entire team. Everyone in the main team was underdeveloped until later episodes. The captain never stood out until later in the series, ironically being the captain. Very few characters has slight development and the rest have almost none. The only character in Inakuni Raimon that was good was their coach, that isn&#039;t even in the team.<br />
However, most of teams outside Inakuni Raimon were wonderfully developed despite their brief appearances. I decide to give the character 7/10.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10<br />
With all the above said, I enjoyed the matches almost as much as the original series. Even though this series involved quite a lot of normal shots which is a new thing in the line of the entire series, it is very enjoyable. I decide to give the enjoyment 9/10.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10

     I am a fan of the original Inazuma Eleven series and enjoyed the GO series. When I first heard that Inazuma Eleven will come back through an alternate universe, I was really excited for it. Twenty-six episodes later, I was disappointed. I didn&#039;t comment about Ares for a while after my first viewing in order to wear off the nostalgia that may have influenced my experience. I then did a rewatch with a clear head, and I&#039;m still disappointed. <br />
<br />
Ares started out strong. There were potential plotlines that could actually modernize Inazuma Eleven in terms of maturity and ideas. Unfortunately, the series had a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review365552">
        lot of flaws. Their matches were stale and predictable. I felt no growth from the characters since all training montages were almost non-existent. The antagonist wasn&#039;t prominent (in context with the story, they didn&#039;t seem relevant). There are several events that happened that made no sense. Inakuni Raimon had promise, but they weren&#039;t impactful so I couldn&#039;t remember their names. <br />
<br />
With that said, the art and sound are nice. The cast did their best with the material given to them and the Inazuma atmosphere was still present thanks to the soundtrack. <br />
<br />
Overall, I found Ares to be a weak alternate universe that failed to use the many interesting ideas it brought up. I didn&#039;t watch a story about soccer and friendship. Instead, I ended up witnessing wasted potential.

    As a fan of the whole franchise and someone who has watched inazuma eleven (incl. go, and all the specials) multiple times, I have to say, that this show is very disappointing. It&#039;s very nostalgic to see all the old characters again, but that just makes it even more frustrating to see how they are treated and downplayed just to highlight new characters. 1 of the worst things about this show has to be the fact that raimon always wins and that through random techniques/tatics etc. that they pull out of nowhere. This is especially an issue because the writters just decided that the trainings,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409566">
        which are a big part of this franchise and helped viewers bond with the characters, are just being skipped. This leaves little room for character development and whenever it happens, the development is indirectly mentioned/forced onto the viewers. It seems like another shows, whos legacy is being ruined. I hope that Orion No Kokuin will be better and not just another way for the production studios to make more profit at the expense of the franchise.
