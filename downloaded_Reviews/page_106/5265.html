        watch this because my girlfriend said that she laughed her head off while watching this. She failed to mention everything else about the show, so this review is mainly focused on preparing you for what you&#039;re planning on watching.<br />
<br />
For a 12 episode series, I was fairly surprised that they could make so many episodes about an incestuous relationship, but somehow they pulled it off. To start off, let&#039;s talk about the story, shall we? The story revolves around a Junior High Schooler, Keita. He&#039;s about to finish his last year before High School. Seems normal enough. Oh, wait, I forgot to mention the fact that before all of this is explained, Keita wakes up to both of his twin sisters sleeping in his bed, cuddled up against him. They wake up, give him a kiss after teasing him a little, and just walk out. First 5 minutes of the anime, that&#039;s what happens. Was not expecting that. Anyways, apparently his sisters love him in a lustful way, and by lustful, I mean that they&#039;re madly in love with him. However, people could debate whether it would be okay for them to love him in that way, due to the fact that they&#039;re his STEPsisters. They aren&#039;t biologically related, but at the same time, brother and sisters... but the main storyline is based off of Keita and his sisters&#039; relationship. In terms of an actual plot, there wasn&#039;t anything big, every story seemed to be something different.<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see, this anime was made 3 years, 2 months ago in 10 days from now. Overall, the artwork was relatively modern. But that&#039;s a good thing, because the artwork today is really quite impressive. It was easy to tell the twins apart, mainly due to the different hairstyles and the bandaid on one of their cheeks, haha. The echii scenes were also fairly detailed, and don&#039;t get me started on  the erotic museum and shopping center... oh God... so detailed... my eyes...<br />
<br />
Sound was one of the reasons this anime might be thought of as a hentai. I think you all may know what that means. Despite that, voice acting was good, if not realistic... I think the thing that made me laugh the most was Riko&#039;s comments and jokes. They were really well thought of, and it brought that mature yet funny side to the anime.<br />
<br />
Ehh... I liked some of the characters, but not all of them. Keita seemed a little indecisive. It wasn&#039;t that I hated him, it&#039;s just that he isn&#039;t really able to make up his mind about a lot of things. He could have a nice relationship with his sisters (not that I support it or anything), but he chooses not to, and the thing is, his parents are all for the idea. That made me laugh a lot, his parents, but still, Keita should make a decision. Ako and Riko were the 2 best characters in the show if you asked for my personal opinion. They seemed like really nice girls, and they really do care for people. With the main characters out of the way, there were a bunch of good minor characters, but despite the fact I liked them, I was glad to see there was a limited amount of air time for each of them, I would have preferred to see the Keita/Ako/Riko story unfold little by little.<br />
<br />
Overall, it was a fairly good anime. It was probably the 2nd time I&#039;ve seen an anime like this (referring to Yosuga no Sora), and I can&#039;t say it&#039;s my favorite kind of anime, but I liked most of it. I enjoyed the comedy and the romance...<br />
<br />
...but it did get annoying having to reposition my laptop on my lap in order to get comfortable again...

    Kiss x Sis is the TV series to the OVA and manga adaptation. It is about a boy, Suminoe Keita, and his everyday encounters (often perverted) with his older twin sisters, Ako and Riko.<br />
<br />
The plot of the series is light, you can almost think of it as slice of life if you take out all the erotic antics from the equation. But then it wouldn&#039;t be AS good as it is now would it?<br />
<br />
Many of the scenes aren&#039;t much better or much worse than what you would see in a regular show this season. Although the details of &quot;certain&quot; scenes clearly had much more dedication

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25784">
        for you know.....Obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
The soundtrack also seems to be similar to the art as it won&#039;t stray too away from the industry standard. You have your mix of erotic music, cliched moment insert songs, and the OP and ED (which were decent).<br />
<br />
As for the charactere s of the show, I think they were nicely done. I think its safe to say that Keita seems like a reasonable representation of most average guys. Now on to the bread and butter of the show, Ako and Riko. While the twins aren&#039;t the most stellar or beautiful characters out there, their love and borderline actions to get to Keita that draws you in, thinking &quot;Oh god go for it&quot; or &quot;DO IT, DO IT&quot;. I do think the twins&#039; were a bit over the top, trying to get off and get into Keita&#039;s pants all the time. But its definitely their appeal that has you coming back for more.<br />
<br />
It would be a giant lie if I said that I don&#039;t enjoy the show. Each episode has a different means of seduction or...enjoyment. And I truthfully admit smiling like a complete idiot at the end of each. Bluntly speaking, it is borderline hentai/porn. The show knows how to take foreplay (for you kiddies reading this wait a few years before find out :P) and make it so much more appealing. So far each episode is a  c**ktease and you know kinda left me &quot;unsatisfied.&quot;<br />
<br />
I originally read and watched the manga and OVA, so the TV animation certainly met my expectations. Although I am a little disappointed that more couldn&#039;t be done to improve the quality of the show in terms of animation and music. I think for many of the viewers, its a hit or miss show. If you don&#039;t like perverted stuff, it really may not be for you. But if you don&#039;t mind feeling a little horny after watching an episode, I definitely recommend this.

    The story revolves around a junior-high student. Keita is your average, easy to relate to guy struggling to get his grades at a certain level, so he can go to the same school as his sisters. Yeah, his twin-sisters. Actually, they aren&#039;t blood related, but their parents married while they were still young. Now normally that wouldn&#039;t be much of a problem, but this time both are madly in love with him. Throughout the anime, they both try to win his heart, often causing him to fail at what is trying to. As the story continues, he gets more and more interested in them, and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29954">
        that even results in a few spicy scenes. Well...what am I saying? I guess you could say this anime has quite a bit borderline hentai scenes. Now don&#039;t think because of that, this anime is bad, because it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s very lighthearted and enjoyable, just as anime like this should be!<br />
<br />
That said, the animation is great, unlike most (borderline) hentai anime. The characters and background are animated well, and I&#039;m quite fond of the colouring. I haven&#039;t found many scenes where characters are moving awkwardly, or anything alike. Sometimes though, especially when scenes get a little more sexual, you&#039;ll notice the occasional flaw, or at least the really hentai-like kissing. But seeing there&#039;s more than enough good animation to make op for that, i don&#039;t really mind at all. And I&#039;m sure most people considering to watch this one wouldn&#039;t either.   <br />
<br />
Both OP en ED are incredibly catchy. After a few episodes i found myself humming the ED while showering. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m really proud of that, but you get my point. The voice acting is pretty good. The two girls are equipped with the required -and well preformed- &quot;little girl&quot; voices, and just hearing Ken Takeuchi voicing Keita is usually more then enough to feel his awkwardness. I saw the OVA before, but still wasn&#039;t expecting much of the voice acting, but i can say I&#039;m positively surprised. <br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t special, but certainly not bad. Keita is the typical &quot;harem-anime lead&quot;, spending most of his time fantasizing about the girls, or doing things with them he normally fantasizes about. Ako is the mature sister, who cooks for the family, has good grades etc. Riko is a more of a childish and playful type. Although you&#039;ll sometimes ask yourself what their differences are, they are especially visable when seducing Keita. <br />
<br />
To fill in some of the blank spots, there are some filler characters. I must say they are pretty well made. There&#039;s a group of guys who represent Keita&#039;s school friends. They constantly point out Keita&#039;s luck to have two hot sisters to love him, often causing Keita to fantasize about his sisters himself. There is also a loli who seems to have a crush on him. And we have Ako&#039;s teacher, who&#039;s also aforementioned loli&#039;s sister, an Otaku who tries to make Keita, Ako and Riko see their incestuous tendencies, are wrong. Their parents also have a small role. They&#039;re very stereotypical parents, except for the fact that dad encourages their love, and especially Keita&#039;s manliness. Last but not least we have Miharu Mikuni, a shy, glasses wearing, big-titted girl, who does the best job providing us with some interesting comedy.    <br />
<br />
Overall I think this is a more than decent anime. The main reason to watch this would be the hot brother-sister action you might be into, but i mostly decided to finish it because it just is a very entertaining anime.<br />
<br />
So, if you&#039;re looking for an easy going anime, and wouldn&#039;t mind some interesting sexual scenes, this might be the anime you&#039;re looking for.<br />

    Keita Suminoe is a fifteen year old middle school student who only wants one thing...  To pass his finals, and make it into the same high school as his older twin sisters, Ako and Riko.  But he has two obstacles standing in his way.  The first is that he’s far more athletic than scholarly, which makes studying and taking tests difficult for him to manage.  And the second is that both of his sisters are madly in love with him, providing him with endless distractions as he tries to do the simplest things like eat, sleep, and of course, study. 

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179665">
        And it’s not just them, either...  One of his teachers, a fellow student that he accidentally groped, and a short loli-like girl from his school are all starving for a taste of his knob.  What can poor Keita do when these women have so much love to give to him, and he only has about six inches to give to them?<br />
<br />
KissXSis was allegedly animated by a small time company called Feel.  Why do I say allegedly?  Because it looks nowhere near as good as one of their other anime, So I Can’t Play H, whose incredible production values was it’s only redeeming factor.  In fact, the difference in quality between these shows that were made only two years apart is so vast that I almost want to call BS on wikipedia for telling it to me.  I guess it’s possible that feel didn’t feel the need to put as much money into this project as they’d later wind up pouring into H, and if that’s the case, I suppose I understand.<br />
<br />
That’s not to say the animation is awful, though.  It’s not great, but I’ve seen plenty of shows that looked a lot worse than this.  The artwork is crisp and clean, and a few of the character designs are inspired, although most of them look generic, and the weird little shiny marks on the girls’ skin can get pretty distracting.  The bare bones budget is actually managed fairly well.   There are several moments when the moneysaving animation techniques are blatantly obvious, but for the most part, the series sticks to slow, limited movements that suit it best, saving it’s money for the few...  Um...  *cough* action scenes that need it more.  What bothered me was more WHAT they were animating than how they were animating it, I guess.  The music isn&#039;t bad either, just generic and forgettable.<br />
<br />
So, I’m going to go into new territory here.  Over my years of reviews, I’ve made a habit out of talking about the animation of any given series as well as the company that produced them, but never before have I talked about the TV station that they aired on.  Since this show doesn’t have an English dub for me to discuss, and I don’t really feel up to discussing the sub, I’m going to go ahead and tell you all about a Japanese TV station called AT-X, or Anime Theater X.  <br />
<br />
AT-X is a Japanese premium channel...  In other words, a pay-per-view station... that, by the very nature of those words, is allowed to show most of their programs uncensored, kind of like HBO.  They’ve aired many TV-MA titles since they were established in 2000, including Elfen Lied, Mahoromatic, Highschool of the Dead, Dance in the Vampire Bund, and the Japanese dub of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic(Wrap your head around that one).  Being a pay-per-view station, they have the right to show their programming with nudity, excessive violence, groping, and all that fun adults-only stuff to it’s mainly adult crowd should they choose to do so, with streaming sites like Funimation.com and Crunchyroll.com opting to air censored versions anyway.<br />
<br />
This turned out to be the perfect place for KissXSis to air, as it’s filled to the brim with adult imagery.  Not only is there underwear shots and bare bottoms galore, this show goes all out with french kissing, lines of drool falling afterwards as a result of said kissing, frequent groping, girls peeing(from many different angles), the outline of the main character’s erect penis through his clothes as his sisters very explicitly fondle it...  And yet, in the very rare moments of actual nudity, the girls in the series were given nondescript Barbie doll bodies.  Considering just how little of a fuck this series gives in regards to it’s content, that’s a hilariously bizarre omission to make.  Because, yeah, as far as this show is willing to go, nipples are the line they don’t want to cross.  It’s especially strange when you take into account that their brother, Keita, very clearly has nipples in the scene when Ako and Riko are teaming up to lick them.  I guess it makes sense that since he’s not blood related to them, he wouldn’t share the same physical deformity that they have.  At least that’s the explanation that I’m sticking with.<br />
<br />
My first attempt to watch this show was back in the fall of 2012.  I’d heard some stuff about it from both sides of the fence, so I felt some morbid curiosity as to just how bad it could really be.  I wound up quitting after two episodes, already calling it the worst anime I’d ever seen.  To be clear, it’s not the incest that turned me off...  I’m not as offended by that topic as a lot of people are.  But in order to make the topic of incest appeal to a broader audience than just the people who want to jerk off to it, you HAVE to play the societal stigma card to make the material relatable.  The related couple has to face judgement from the people around them.  I mentioned as much in my review of Oreimo, and I even used what little I’d seen of KissXSis as a reference tool.  <br />
<br />
What had me running away from KissXSis as fast as I possibly could was, ultimately, the way it’s world was reacting to our three blood crossed lovers.  At school, the entire male student body was obsessed with Ako and Riko, to the point that they would ostracize and bully Keita for living with them, and form an unruly mob to chase the two girls whenever they wandered onto the school’s campus.  The only character who showed any repulsion to the idea was some big boobed glasses girl who you could immediately tell was just going to fall in love with Keita, effectively turning what could have been moral outrage into jealousy.  As I would later learn from the appearance of his teacher, that’s exactly what the writers were going for.  Keep in mind, at no point in the story are we given any insight into why such bland looking characters would be sexually deified to such extreme levels.<br />
<br />
And to make matters worse, their parents weren’t just okay with this debauchery between their children...  They were encouraging it.  Right at the end of episode 1, they start hounding Keita to excavate the gold mine of forbidden pussy that lived a few rooms down from him.  They also drop the bomb on us that Keita and his sisters aren’t really related by blood...  Keita is his son, and the twins are the mom’s daughters, so they’re actually just step siblings, and the anime constantly shoves the fact that they’re blood relatives down our throats to remind us that what’s going on between them is perfectly A-ok.  Which, as I’ve mentioned in the past, it’s not.  Children who grow up from a young age together as siblings and go through puberty in closed together become sexually desensitized to each other, and I swear i’m not making that up.  Whether or not they’re actually related by blood is a non-issue, that’s just how it works.  It’s legally okay, but only the sleaziest perverts ever call upon legal loopholes to excuse their tastes.<br />
<br />
After confirming with the second episode that this show was not going to get any better, I decided I’d had enough, and stayed away from it for a year and a half.  That was until my long awaited two week vacation from work, when I let my two best friends each pick an anime for me to watch in my free time, and one of them challenged me to finish the series once and for all.  The only reason I’m not going to punch him in the face is because he said I don’t have to watch the OVAs.<br />
<br />
Upon my second attempt to watch KissXSis, I’ve noticed that not only does the series never get any better, but it takes every possible opportunity to get worse.  And I’m not just talking about the depraved sexual content, which any viewer will either be able to take or leave.  There is nothing in this series that’s even remotely suggestive of any kind of story-telling.  The only plot is whether or not Keita will wind up sleeping with one of his sisters, but he’s so willing to fool around with them at the slightest provocation that it winds up not really mattering whether they cross the line or not.  The only conflict is over which sister he winds up with, but he never really shows any preference, and will happily switch between them as though they were Coke and Pepsi.  <br />
<br />
There’s no story either, as the entire series is just an endless string of moments between Keita and his sisters, with no stakes, no surprises, no revelations, just interaction after interaction, competition after competition.  It can’t get old, though, because unless you were on the edge of your seat waiting for something graphic to happen, it was never interesting in the first place.  It’s portrayal of women is insanely ignorant and misogynistic, but...  Well...  It’s hard to be mad at it about that, because at no point does it ever seem to concern itself with what women are really like.  Granted, I ranted and raved about that when I originally rage-quit the series, but upon a fresh look, and a surprisingly boring viewing experience that was occasionally interrupted by random bouts of “You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” I think I’ve finally nailed what this anime is, and why it feels like a nonentity to me at this point, as well as why I can’t bring myself to be angry over how brain-smashingly reprehensible the content is.<br />
<br />
KissXSis is, at it’s core, a sexless hentai.  Now, I’ve seen several anime that I could throw that same label at before, but this is the first one I’ve ever seen that was actually aired on TV.  There is nothing more pointless than a safe-for-TV porno.  You can not realistically expect a porno to have realistic female characters, because it’s a porno.  It’s a jerk-off fantasy.  The only real reason someone could possibly watch this all the way through is to jerk off to it(watching it for reviewing purposes is not a real reason...  I’m insane, and a horrible person, so don’t do what I did).  Everything that happens in this show is just build-up to sex scenes that never happen, leaving it only palatable for the most desperate viewers who are looking for a good incest romp and somehow don’t realize that there are actual hentai out there.  <br />
<br />
The only other type of audience I can imagine this series having would be people who either A: Have siblings they wish they could screw or B:  Wish they had siblings they could screw, and in either case, they’re droolingly eager to find some sort of escapist self-insert jerk-off fantasy where they have a pair of willing and able sisters that aren’t technically related to them, in a world where only the jealous haters have anything negative to say about it.  That would be the life, wouldn’t it?  Only no, it wouldn’t.  Grow up, and stop kidding yourselves.<br />
<br />
KissXSis has never been released stateside, and no self-respecting legal streaming service would ever touch it with a sixty foot pole.  It’s available on illegal streaming sites, and while I’d normally never recommend such a tactic, I honestly don’t care one way or another whether or not this title makes any money.  You can also find the Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay for dirt cheap, as it’s only about thirteen dollars for the TV version of the series, and around the same cost for the OVA series of equal length that came out a few years prior.<br />
<br />
If KissXSis had been released as an actual legitimate hentai title, with at least the majority of it’s story arcs ending in sexual pay-offs, it would easily be one of the best titles in it’s genre, and no, I’m not exaggerating that.  The characters are well developed and complex...  By hentai standards.  The story is intelligent and well thought out...  By hentai standards.  The animation and music are very well produced...  By hentai standards.  With actual pay-offs instead of blue-ball teasing, the pacing would have been outstanding...  By hentai standards.  But this series wasn’t released straight to DVD in the adults only section of your local DVD store.  It was released on TV, in a much harsher and stricter medium.  As a legitimate TV anime, this show is just flat out pathetic, tasteless trash that only the most desperate and depraved audiences will find any sort of satisfaction with.  Since I am not one of them, I can’t even give this show a zero without feeling like I’m being too lenient with it.  Thus, I give KissXSis a -4/10.  Or I would, if MAL would let me.

    It&#039;s very easy to misinterpret this masterpiece as your average ecchi-sketchy show, or even label it as &quot;borderline hentai&quot;. Admittedly, it gets extremely raunchy many times. But that&#039;s the allure of the show and the artists challenge to its viewers. Can you look past the lewd and see the authors stark depictions of the every day life of a girl suffering through extended child abuse? <br />
<br />
Spoilers ahoy, you&#039;ve been warned.<br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
From the first episode we&#039;re introduced to our hero Keita, your typical unaware harem protagonist. He&#039;s got girls hanging off him left and right, to the envy of his entire school. The major plot of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146869">
        the show is his twin sisters attempt to get him admitted to their highschool.<br />
<br />
Their infatuation with their brother is apparent extremely early, always sneaking into his room at night or trying to fool around with him. For all you wincest fans, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re well aware of how often incest occurs in reality. There&#039;s the normal siblings fooling around as toddlers/children, playing doctor of sorts. And then there&#039;s the real stuff where they know what they&#039;re doing. That last one rarely ever happens, and when it does, it&#039;s usually a sign of something having gone wrong in the household. And something is very wrong in this household.<br />
<br />
One of the heroines, Riko, as part of her character design, wears a bandage on the side of her face. One could assume perhaps she has a blemish she&#039;s hiding, as one would expect of someone wearing a bandage. However, this show takes place over the course of almost a year. Any normal blemishes would have long disappeared by then. Compounding that fact is the appearance of numerous flashbacks to when the trio were small children. Riko wears the same bandage in the same spot. By now, a casual viewer may just write if off as lazy writing, but it&#039;s actually a carefully crafted plot device.<br />
<br />
The main characters mother and father (especially the father) encourage this incestuous relationship, even offering &quot;chances&quot; to Keita. Normally, parents are against incest, at most willfully oblivious or ambivalent. Outright support raises many red flags. And that red flag is that the father has been abusing these girls for a very long time. Riko is a rather rambunctious girl, likely she resisted his advances at one point and he hit her, scarring her. In her shame she covered it up with that bandage we see in the flashbacks. Ako is also a victim in this.<br />
<br />
To deal with this trauma, they seek out their new brother, Keita. Throughout the anime, the girls try to sneak into his room for the night, because they know if they stay in their own, their father will pay them a visit. Keita, of course, is a bright young boy and is well aware of this, that&#039;s why he acts so oblivious to their advances. If he dares speak up against this, his father will hurt him, maybe even kill him. The mother is likely in denial about the whole thing, thinking it&#039;s just a silly game.<br />
<br />
All this masked in what appears to be your typical harem-comedy.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
<br />
Nothing really special.<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
Again, nothing memorable. The ED is pretty good though.<br />
<br />
Character: Refer above 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10 OR 0/10<br />
<br />
If you understand what I mean by those dual scores. On one hand, it disgusted me how heart-wrenching it was, and I did not enjoy that. However, the fact that it did that deserves a 10.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Wonderful show with something for everyone. For the casual viewer, you have a fun little incest romp. For the critical viewer, you have incest deconstruction and multi-layered plots and characters.

    Fact is wherever there’s anime, there’s almost always some sort of fan service to be had as well. Ecchi series have been around for quite some time now and with every new show there also seems to be a continuous rise in the explicit material that is allowed to be shown on television, much to the delight of many otakus out there. One such show that pushes the boundaries is Kiss x Sis, an ecchi anime that attempts to blend perversion and comedy while also throwing some incest in the mix. Oh joy.<br />
<br />
Kiss x Sis focuses on male protagonist Suminoe Keita and the shenanigans pulled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review43997">
        on him by his two older twin sisters – or stepsisters, to be more accurate. The story takes place during Keita’s last year in middle school as he struggles with his final exams while also trying to resist (‘deal with’ would be the more accurate term, actually) his sisters’ often perverted advances towards him. Obscene things happen, comedy ensues, and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Most episodes adopt a casual pace and narrative typical of many other ecchi anime – not much happens plot-wise for the most part. Of course, there are some episodes that are an exception to the rule, though unfortunately in this case that’s not a good thing. Kiss x Sis does well in the ecchi and comedy departments, delivering some truly borderline hentai moments and successfully mixing in humour whenever the need arises. Surprisingly enough, the episodes that focus more on this aspect and disregard plot development are the ones that are the most enjoyable out of the lot.<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, things don’t work too well when the anime goes for a more plot-oriented episode. Keita’s preparation for his upcoming exams makes for a useful plot point at first, delivering some good laughs as the sisters go about their usual sneaky ways in trying to intervene with Keita’s study hours both to support him and—perhaps more importantly—to get closer to him. Unfortunately, as the series progresses, a continually increasing focus is given to the more dramatic side of the story, which does not work at all simply because there’s no character development there to support it and also due to the fact that there’s a lack of compatibility between the comedy slash ecchi side and the serious side of the show.<br />
<br />
There are moments when Kiss x Sis finds greatness and in turn delivers solid entertainment filled with humour and fan service that at times will leave you wondering just how far this anime is willing to go in that respect, but ultimately the series is brought down by its unnecessary need to inject drama into the whole affair. Those looking for ecchi and some entertainment will certainly not go wrong with Kiss x Sis, but then again, there are plenty other shows out there that offer more in pretty much every department.

    This is a much better romance than the likes of Nisekoi (which makes me sick btw) watching the beautiful relationships that this show details fills my heart with joy and makes my day so much better. This show makes me really wish i had a really hot sister so i could enjoy myself by indulging in this kind of a relationship with her &gt;///&lt;. <br />
<br />
when i try and come on to my 13 year old sister she always screams and pushes away and cries non stop and i wish she was just more understanding of my situation. As a 28 year old myself I only

    The first story are Keita has two older step-sisters, Ako and Riko, but since they aren&#039;t related by blood, they love him in a lustful way. After a mishap at school, Ako and Riko finally confess their love to him. Keita dislikes the thought of seeing them other then brother and sister, but as he tries to enter the same school as his sisters, he slowly becomes attracted to them. Now normally that wouldn&#039;t be much of a problem, but this time both are madly in love with him. Throughout the anime, they both try to win his heart, often causing him to fail at

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71297">
        what is trying to. As the story continues, he gets more and more interested in them, and that even results in a few spicy scenes. Well...what am I saying? I guess you could say this anime has quite a bit borderline hentai scenes. Now don&#039;t think because of that, this anime is bad, because it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s very lighthearted and enjoyable, just as anime like this should be!<br />
<br />
That said, the animation is great, unlike most (borderline) hentai anime. The characters and background are animated well, and I&#039;m quite fond of the colouring. I haven&#039;t found many scenes where characters are moving awkwardly, or anything alike. Sometimes though, especially when scenes get a little more sexual, you&#039;ll notice the occasional flaw, or at least the really hentai-like kissing. But seeing there&#039;s more than enough good animation to make op for that, i don&#039;t really mind at all. And I&#039;m sure most people considering to watch this one wouldn&#039;t either.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Both OP en ED are incredibly catchy. After a few episodes i found myself humming the ED while showering. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m really proud of that, but you get my point. The voice acting is pretty good. The two girls are equipped with the required -and well preformed- &quot;little girl&quot; voices, and just hearing Ken Takeuchi voicing Keita is usually more then enough to feel his awkwardness. I saw the OVA before, but still wasn&#039;t expecting much of the voice acting, but i can say I&#039;m positively surprised.<br />
<br />
The characters aren&#039;t special, but certainly not bad. Keita is the typical &quot;harem-anime lead&quot;, spending most of his time fantasizing about the girls, or doing things with them he normally fantasizes about. Ako is the mature sister, who cooks for the family, has good grades etc. Riko is a more of a childish and playful type. Although you&#039;ll sometimes ask yourself what their differences are, they are especially visable when seducing Keita.<br />
<br />
To fill in some of the blank spots, there are some filler characters. I must say they are pretty well made. There&#039;s a group of guys who represent Keita&#039;s school friends. They constantly point out Keita&#039;s luck to have two hot sisters to love him, often causing Keita to fantasize about his sisters himself. There is also a loli who seems to have a crush on him. And we have Ako&#039;s teacher, who&#039;s also aforementioned loli&#039;s sister, an Otaku who tries to make Keita, Ako and Riko see their incestuous tendencies, are wrong. Their parents also have a small role. They&#039;re very stereotypical parents, except for the fact that dad encourages their love, and especially Keita&#039;s manliness. Last but not least we have Miharu Mikuni, a shy, glasses wearing, big-titted girl, who does the best job providing us with some interesting comedy.<br />
<br />
Overall I think this is a more than decent anime. The main reason to watch this would be the hot brother-sister action you might be into, but i mostly decided to finish it because it just is a very entertaining anime.<br />
<br />
if<br />
interesting sexual scenes, this might be the anime you&#039;re looking for.

    Story: KxS has two parts, it&#039;s about twin sisters who are in love with there slightly younger stepbrother, and the stepbrother trying to get into the same highschool as them. While this sounds like a pretty simple story I have to give the writters credit for not making this either a true incest ecchi or an ecchi where the guy is just thrown in with a buch as girls who all love him (although there are others who slightly do). The story was fairly original although there were the typical filler episodes, a little heavy on the fan sevice in some but not too ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48943">
        personally thought this anime was great, in ecchi the main character almost always gets swarmed with ditsy girls who hit on him and he just seems like an idiot, but not here. In KxS the 3 main characters all had their own personalities and qualities, for example they could&#039;ve made ako and riko (the twin sisters) airheads who acted just like one another but the only real quality they share is that they care for Keita. Also (and I really like to thank the writters for this) Keita wasn&#039;t some stupid idiot who was thrown into all this, he had his own set of morals and when his sisters started to hit on him he resisted and didn&#039;t give in (although there were some moments) which I find refreshing to see something that doesn&#039;t stereotype guys as horny idiots. It was nice to watch the progression of the relationship the three shared with each other and I&#039;m glad there was the actual plot of him trying to get in the same highschool his sisters are in, this way it wasn&#039;t just based off of the sisters fighting for his love. Again I love the story because of Keita&#039;s morals he is put in a situation were both his stepsisters have feelings for him and he knows that he can&#039;t choose one but instead of going for both he makes the harder but much more mature decision not to give into them. I was however a little disappointed at the end where while they did complete the plot there was not too much on the part everyone cares about which is what  happens with keita riko and ako. One thing I didn&#039;t like about the story is throwing in about 3 other girls who appeared to like him, if they left them out I might&#039;ve given this a 9 depending on how well they would&#039;ve done without them. The 5 OVA episodes which are the first 5 episodes are a little better than the tv anime, I did find the transition from the OVA to the anime to be a little confusing because it seemed like their relationship in the anime hadn&#039;t advanced to where it was in the OVA&#039;s although the plot was in order.<br />
<br />
Music: the music was good, it fit the anime very well, from the opening and ending thems to the music during the episode they all seem to fit nicely.<br />
<br />
Art: the art was also good, cute characters not too many lazy scene of just pictures (although there wasn&#039;t much movement during talking), still fits the anime.<br />
<br />
Characters: the characters were the highlight of this anime, they were given their own personalities and were original.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I definetally enjoyed this anime, I was scepticle when I first started thinking it would just be another ecchi but was shocked to see how much I got to know the characters and think that anyone who isn&#039;t afraid of ecchi and some real funny/romantic moments should watch this.<br />
<br />
On a final note I would like to say to women out there who critisize ecchi to understand that what it is is basically and romcom adapted for guys, if you take out the sexual mishaps/encounters, go a little heavier on the drama and make 1/4 of the characters guys most women would love it.

    Finally it&#039;s there, the Kiss x Sis TV Series. As I was scanlating the Manga, I was longing for that even before the OVA was published. For starters: Unlike the OVA it&#039;s not going straight after the Manga! So don&#039;t get your hopes high, but still I think, if you liked the Manga, you&#039;ll like the TV-Show.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
+ What&#039;s KxS about? Well, it&#039;s some kind of typical setting: One normal perverted boy, a few girls and a lot of ecchi. The exception on this &quot;normalism&quot; is, that 2 of these girls are his sisters. But as usual they aren&#039;t blood related... I think there is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25096">
        no big plot behind this, meaning every episode will be with a different storyboard then the others. But I could be wrong, it&#039;s hard to tell after just 2 episodes. After all it&#039;ll be something like: Whom will Keita end up with? Hey but that&#039;s the way we want it to happen, isn&#039;t it... In comparision to the OVA the TV show seems to be more Mainstream and not as &quot;hardcore&quot;. I just want to remind you of the episode 3 of the OVA ;). BUt we&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
+ Oh, it&#039;s nice to watch Riko and Ako-nee, they are very well drawn, as the backgrounds and the Details. There are no big specialeffects, blurs or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
+ I think it&#039;s good, nothing out of the ordinary, but good. The voices are fitting the picture most of the time - and the music doesn&#039;t f*ck your nerves.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
+ Ho, that&#039;s the way we like it! Cuteness, some kind of mature elements, innocence and did I already mention cuteness? My favourite would be probably Ako, as she already was in the manga. No, they are balanced very well, and it&#039;s not as every kind of fetish will be covered with dozens of girls. There are just a few, but I think one of them will capture your heart non the less.<br />
<br />
Fazit:<br />
<br />
During the Anime you can see all the elements of an Harem-anime you want to see: Love Trouble, holding back, perverted thoughts, love triangles, cute girls and ecchiness ;). But you should watch the Anime as just this Anime - The plot has only the same Theme as the Manga or OVA but, it&#039;s not the same storyline. I think the theme is pretty interessting - as the father and mother support the love of these 3, and it&#039;s all done in a funny way. Well for now I really like this show, and want to recommend it, but just if you like ecchi and harem Anime ;).<br />
<br />
Overall Rating: 8 for now.

    Kiss x Sis is the second incest or sibling x sibling anime that I have watched, and safe to say it will be the last. The whole concept is just a bit too… I don’t even know. Incest. But hey some people like that I guess, I’m not here to judge anyone… just joking. <br />
<br />
 Seeing as I have only watched two anime in this genre, I don’t have a whole lot to compare it with. I found that there was a more comedic side to this show, which I felt made it a little easier to view, in comparison to Yosuga no Sora which

          <span style="display: none;" id="review117973">
        is a bit more ‘psychological’. <br />
<br />
Story: Pretty simple, a brother and two sisters live together and are in love with each other. They constantly think up ways to seduce their brother, or help him whether it be with schooling or other life related problems. That’s basically all that happens. The end. <br />
<br />
 Art: The artwork was great. I wasn&#039;t expecting a lot in this department, but it pleasantly surprised me, but by all means I’m not saying it was a masterpiece. Just the same as any other ROM-COM made past 2010. <br />
<br />
Sound: Both the OP and ED fit in really well with the series. It’s not something I would listen to, however it did compliment the show. Sound effects and voice acting was probably one of the strongest elements I found, as it all sounded crisp and professional. <br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t love this show although i didn&#039;t hate it. However realistically speaking if the two girls weren&#039;t his ‘sisters’ and just happened to be living with him for some reason like… their parents passed away or I don’t know, something creative, it would have been a enjoyable show to watch. <br />
<br />
8 points for effort.<br />

    Have you ever wonder what it is like to live with twin sisters who are madly in love with you? In Kiss x Sis, Keita, an average middle school and soon to be high school student, experiences such that. His sisters, Ako and Riko constantly harass him in a weird way in order to show their affections for him. This continues throughout every episode thus becoming entertaining and unpredictable as to what Ako and Riko will do next to Keita.<br />
<br />
The plot is straight forward; Ako and Riko help Kieta pass his entrance exam into high school. What you see on the outside is what you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75677">
        get. There isn&#039;t anything hidden underneath the story-line, but even so the anime is able to deliver many things along the way; from entertainment to its viewers to splendid characterization of its characters. In every episode, Ako and Riko would do something different to get affections from Keita, and each time the things they do are hilarious while other time they are more perverted thus making the contents border-line hentai. It might be great for fan service, but deals a lengthy blow to the anime in a sense that it provided a scene that did not benefit the story-line, but rather pro-long that specific episode. As I mentioned earlier, some scenes were did not enter the realm of border-line hentai thus it was a great source of comedy and made the anime enjoyable. On there other hand, characterization was good since the anime was able to individualize each character in their own specific group thus each character had their own specific feature, so if someone ask me to recall a character on their trait---doing it would be an easy task.<br />
<br />
In terms of art, the anime is ranked average due to the fact that it can be found in most harem anime, but there were moments in the anime when the art shown improvement such as in the &quot;ecchi&quot; moments. The art for Ako and Riko is fascinating; the way they look is appealing and make them stand out from the rest of the other characters thus they added a kind of uniqueness to the anime. The opening song was fine, but th ending song is a different story. The ED song was very catchy and easy catches one attention and you can&#039;t help it but to listen it to the very end. Along with the ED animation, how can one resist?<br />
<br />
In the end, Kiss x Sis is a pleasant anime and for people who enjoy ecchi moments and a good slice of life.

    Kiss x Sis is a risqué story about love, lust and, comedy. It’s an Ecchi with a very basic plot that uses absurd shenanigans often times sexual in nature as the comedic device of the show. Usually leaving the viewer thinking “wtf am I watching”. At the beginning of every episode I would wonder what kind of silly antics Ako and Riko would employ on their brother this time. <br />
<br />
Ako and Riko have an immense amount of love for their younger brother, even to the point where they will not consider dating any other boys and will turn down all other admirers. They express their

          <span style="display: none;" id="review166821">
        love through lustful acts towards their brother Keita, quite possibly in the best way they could express their love. The show really takes you back to traditional family values and the importance of loving the ones you are with. Peoples criticism of the whole “Incest” thing is generally exaggerated, I mean come on their not even blood related! Incest is Wincest after all. <br />
<br />
This anime is all about self-control and how one should not always give into lust and temptation as demonstrated by Keita’s character throughout the series. I viewed it as a case study of what to do in such circumstances. Unfortunately I myself would not have been able to resist such temptations in many of the situations Keita finds himself in. But on occasion he will give in if only for an instance, this shows that even Keita is only human and can be overtaken by feelings of lust and temptation.   <br />
<br />
If you are going to watch this I would strongly recommend you watch it with your sisters, if you don’t have any just watch it with your mom.

    Okay, a little backstory. About a year and a half ago a friend told me about this and he said it was pretty messed. I didn&#039;t think it would be that bad... but I was wrong. This anime is crap. The main problem is that it made me say: &#039;What the hell?!&#039; every couple of minutes. The two sisters trying to bang their younger step brother and often molesting him just creeped me out, but I couldn&#039;t stop! I&#039;d finish an episode and say, &#039;That&#039;s it, I&#039;m done.&#039; But I couldn&#039;t stop watching it! I needed to see what was going to happen!<br />
<br />
Now that rant

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180097">
        is out of the way, lets get to the nitty gritty bits. The art of the show is pretty average and the story is pretty poor. Every episode is basically the sisters trying to find a way to seduce their brother and then molest him. I disliked most of the characters especially Keita, who had very little character and was basically there to be an object of his sisters&#039; desires. The sisters themselves are alright characters but they still made me uncomfortable sometimes.<br />
<br />
I didn&#039;t completely hate the series though: I found some enjoyment in some of the episodes (one bit involving a chocolate banana). The only character who I really enjoyed was the teacher of the two sisters who is an otaku obsessed with samurai who tries to stop the sisters from trying to sleep with Keita. She had good moments and one of the few characters who I cared for. The opening and ending songs are also one of my highlights, incredibly catchy and fun numbers.<br />
<br />
Overall, pretty bad show with mostly bad characters but some funny moments, one character and good opening and ending songs stand out

    Ok so i was browsing the animelist on Animefreak.tv today and i watched a short 12 episode anime called Kiss x Sis. Now Kiss x Sis is an anime that borderlines with hentai expending on whether or not you&#039;re watching it uncensored or censored. Although there was a bit more fanservice than i would have liked, i enjoyed the anime nonetheless for a few reasons which i&#039;ll get back to later. But for now, let me break down my scores and give explanations <br />
<br />
Story-7: The story was pretty basic for the most part. -i&#039;m not gonna spoil the story for you since i&#039;m assuming you&#039;re

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29967">
        reading this review to decide if you wanna watch it- But for a short 12 episode anime series, i like the predictatble kinda generic or basic story because it&#039;ll be a short watch and it draws my attention for time. Whoever wrote the story for Kiss x Sis did a decent job in my opinion, but i would have liked to see a bit more of the cool things the main character did for his sisters before the story starts. but that&#039;s just me. <br />
<br />
Art-8: The artwork was well done in my bias. i watched Kiss x Sis in decent quality so the artwork shined. While some of the characters look badly drawn-otaku&#039;s dream boy(character reference)- others look well done, which i don&#039;t really mind as long as it&#039;s not stick figures lol. <br />
<br />
Sound-8: The sound definitely hits home with what the anime is trying to do. the cutesy innocent kinda pop songs that make you scratch your head and wanna pretend like you saw nothing. the voice acting was well done as well. no freaky english in this anime, it sounds well done. <br />
<br />
Characters-9: Whoever&#039;s mind created this cast of characters is good. He/She took some steorotypes and mixed them with other steorotypes which makes them seem fresh, which is a good idea in my personal bias. The teacher&#039;s character is definately my favorite-you&#039;ll see why if you watch it- she&#039;s insane... end of disscussion <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-8: Although the entire anime is BRIMMING with fan service, i enjoyed the few tibits of comedy. even though some of the comedic scenes had some form of a sex joke in them. I can&#039;t say that i was disguested, but i  enjoyed the anime. <br />
<br />
Overall-7: This anime is definately out of my comfort zone-action comedy and some lovin- but i can&#039;t say that i regretted wasting around 3-5 hours watching it. It was a good anime but i must say, much of the stuff borderlined with hentai depending if you watching the censored version or not. because there are some scenes that will make you go, that&#039;s just nasty. But if you don&#039;t mind the hentai-ish scenes and are looking for some comedic love triangle anime, i&#039;d say watch the first few episodes and go from there. take a chance and who knows you might just stay to watch it.

    Picture this: 12 year-old alone on the family computer. Love robots, love anime, and don&#039;t have even an inkling of how sex works. Then this clip, this FUCKING clip shows up in my reccomended after having binged all of Misty Chronexia&#039;s videos, and this video is called &quot;Kiss X Sis Chocolate Scene&quot;. My curosity gets the better of me. Kiss X Sis? What fucking idiot would title a show that? what could this possibly have in store for me? I click on it and holy shit. Holy fucking shit. Oh my God. Why is my peepee getting hard. why am I sweating. Why am I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383004">
        getting so flustered. I shut the video off and repress the experience. I go to bed, my member rock-hard with no way to relieve myself. it captures my attention, and every day after school before my parents come home I look up variations of &quot;anime boob&quot;, &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;anime sex&quot; on google and I have my quiet, solitary world shattered into a thousand pieces. Later that night I masturbate for the first time. I thought I pissed my pants. And from that day forth, I would never be the same. <br />
<br />
Haven&#039;t watched the show but it looks hot so idk 1 6 I guess

    Have you ever watched something so ridiculous you couldn’t have enough of it? That’s what this is. Kiss x Sis is so ridiculous, you just can’t stop watching it. This anime is like a box of assorted candy, you don’t know what you’re going to expect. The genre’s for this anime are harem, ecchi, romance, school, and comedy.<br />
<br />
Story: (6/10)<br />
<br />
The story’s setting is like any other school based anime you watch. You see the typical track field, the school classroom, and the typical festival. The story itself, however, is something you don’t usually see in an anime. The main character, Keita, has to choose between one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195398">
        of his two sisters, Ako and Riko, who aren’t related to him by blood, to marry as he tries to enter the same school as them. Unfortunately, you don’t get to see who he marries in the end, which I was disappointed by, but you do see the female characters try to get the upper advantage over each other to win Keita’s affection which I found to be quite interesting. As you may have expected, Kiss x Sis is sexual in a lot of ways. From using objects as a way to show affection to almost having sex with your sister, if I can say one thing about this, it’s borderline from becoming a hentai. Well of course you couldn’t have an ecchi and harem anime without its clichés. You’ll see many clichés throughout this anime such as nose bleeds, boob grabbing, and panty shots. You’d expect these clichés to be dumb, but for some odd reason Kiss x Sis does it in a funny way in which you will forgive it. <br />
<br />
Art: (8/10)<br />
<br />
The animation for this anime was produced by a company called Feel. If you haven’t heard or don’t know the animation company, Feel, they’re the ones who produced Mayo Chiki!, Yosuga no Sora, Outbreak Company, and My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO. The art style and environment to this anime looks typical. I’m not saying that’s bad, but nothing really stood out to me. <br />
<br />
Sound: (8/10)<br />
<br />
The opening and ending theme songs sound J-popish, which I don’t really mind, but I didn’t find them to be memorable at all. The same goes for the background music, but it seemed to match each scene, which is fine in my book. The voice actors and actress did a fine job too, I couldn’t really complain.<br />
<br />
Characters: (7/10)<br />
<br />
What’s an anime without its characters? The characters itself are pretty generic, but have a clear distinction between them. There are some clichéd side characters such as the loli and big breasted female character. For the rest, there’s actually some uniqueness to them. For example, one of the characters is bad at cooking, while the other is not. Using the character’s uniqueness, the writers use the character’s characteristics to make each character seem like the best fit for the main character to date. All the characters certainly elevate our main character by giving his harem role. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (8/10)<br />
<br />
The reason why I gave this an 8 out of 10 is because I felt awkward and uncomfortable at times. There’s this one character, in the show, who is your essential loli. One of the many things I did not like about her is that she’s flashes her panties at Keita, which feels really weird and awkward considering she is in middle school, but hey, I give props to the creator for writing something that we usually don’t see. The thing I like about Kiss x Sis is that it tops the last perverted thing they did. If you’re going to make a harem and ecchi based anime, at least make it outrageous enough for you to like it and kiss x sis exactly does that.<br />
<br />
Overall: (7/10)<br />
<br />
Overall, I enjoyed this anime, but I felt empty after watching this. It felt like something was missing. I enjoyed the show, but I didn’t feel hooked with the overall storyline. After I finished, I asked myself, “Was that it? Is there any more?” I wasn’t satisfied with the story and I certainly wasn’t satisfied with the ecchi. It felt like it needed more. Kiss x Sis will certainly entertain you with outrageous sexual acts, but it lacks meaningful story that I can’t really connect.<br />

    Story: 6/10<br />
The story of Kiss x Sis was like any other ecchi and harem anime. This one was by far fair I&#039;d say. The story of incest as well as other females were told really well from this specific genre of anime. When I watched Kiss x Sis, I was honestly in pain due to the pure incest I witnessed in the story. Other than that, it really brought incest as its main source of entertainment and it does it well.<br />
<br />
Art: 5/10<br />
The art for Kiss x Sis was mediocre due to the rusty movements in the general scenes. The sisters however, were well made characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review354524">
        and they do look alike in a sense of twin sisters and incest. The brother really looked like a wimp and I did not like his character design. In general, the art was very mediocre and that is all I have to say.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10<br />
The opening and ending songs for Kiss x Sis were not that memorable. The sisters had great voice acting and really brought out that hentai feel to it. That itself I would rate a 10/10 but I really did not like the main character&#039;s voice and it was so damn annoying. So I picked the middle score and went for a 7/10.<br />
<br />
Character: 7/10<br />
Same thing with the voice acting, I really liked the sisters and the other females. The teacher also and the piss girl. However, the MC did not fulfill the capacity of the females and therefore did not complement the female pheromones that was radiating in each episode.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10<br />
Despite all that hatred towards the male MC, I enjoyed the female characters entirely  and I would say they have great aspects that make each character trashy yet unique. They all have their unique trashy personalities that make up what Kiss x Sis&#039; cast.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10<br />
Kiss x Sis was a good harem ecchi anime and it was one of the first ones I&#039;ve watched. It was trashy in its own way done right. I think it could have been better if it went slightly more trashy without crossing the line of being too trashy if you get what I mean. That is all I have to say and happy watching.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind I am no anime expert and I am just writing this review to share my thoughts regarding the different elements of Kiss x Sis.

    There are certain issues that it can be rather tricky to handle in fiction of any kind.  Drug addiction, suicide, sexual abuse, etc.  One of these topics is incest - and while some shows have it to act as a commentary of sorts, for every show that does this (the only example that comes to my head is Koi Kaze), there&#039;s a show that has incest for the sake of incest.  Like KissxSis.<br />
<br />
Story - 3/10<br />
The story to KissXSis is a rather generic harem/romcom story, with the only thing that&#039;s really unique about it being the incest.  The plot of each episode

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189056">
        centers around Riko and Ako attempting to seduce their brother - and given the main &quot;appeal&quot; of this anime, you can probably guess what happens at the end.  The story tries to excuse the incest by saying that Keita (our male lead) and his sisters, Riko and Ako, aren&#039;t related by blood - they&#039;re related by marriage.  And I don&#039;t buy that excuse, because quite frankly, they&#039;re still related - it&#039;s still incest.  You can get a flu vaccine via that mist technique instead of having a shot, but that still doesn&#039;t change the fact that you got a vaccine.  At least the show has Keita&#039;s sisters be slightly older than he is.<br />
<br />
Half of the events are ones that would work in a generic harem/romcom, but there are also events that are absolutely disgusting.  For example: in one episode, Riko and Ako both make a good luck charm for their brother.  While this sounds innocent enough, they do so by putting one of their pubes in the charm.<br />
<br />
Art - 6/10<br />
I&#039;m not a fan of the style they used here, but it wasn&#039;t unpleasant to look at - it&#039;s passable.  Nothing I&#039;d write home about, but nothing I would condemn, either.<br />
<br />
Sound - 4/10<br />
The sound isn&#039;t bad per say, it&#039;s just pretty forgettable - the opening is generic J-Pop, and the ending is also pretty generic.  The voice acting is...okay, I guess, but it&#039;s not something I&#039;d say really stands out about this show.<br />
<br />
Character - 3/10<br />
Riko and Ako are generic older sisters, who only interested in screwing their brother - they don&#039;t even talk about normal conversation topics (I do not remember a single moment where they talked about something like the weather or how they were doing at school).  Keita seems like he&#039;s resisting their efforts at first, but he then goes to reluctant to have them fall for him, to not having a problem with their advances by the end.<br />
<br />
There was literally only 1 character who objected to Riko and Ako&#039;s efforts to seduce their brother - their teacher, Yuuzuki Kiryuu (and it&#039;s for that reason why I actually found her to be the one character I liked about the show), who happens to be a closet Otaku (I know that Otaku generally refers to males, but I forget the female counterpart), and she&#039;s really into cosplay (this is actually important during several scenes).  Everyone else doesn&#039;t have a problem with it - in fact, the parents of the 3 main characters actually encourage Riko and Ako.  It would have been one thing if they did this once as a joke, and then scolded the twin sisters the rest of the time.  But no, the story chooses not to redeem itself.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 1/10<br />
I actually enjoy watching harems every now and then (it&#039;s not a perfect genre, but there are shows in the genre that I genuinely enjoy), but this was the first one that I watched (that I didn&#039;t have mental scars as a result of watching) where I did not have at least some enjoyment from watching it.<br />
<br />
Overall - 2/10<br />
I&#039;d just skip this one.  It&#039;s not really worth your time, and there are tons of better series out there that would take you the same amount of time to watch as it would take you to watch this one.<br />
<br />

    Not one of my proudest moments watching this show. Not to mention that I am most likely the complete opposite demographic for this show. But despite my expectations, it was a lot better than I thought - was actually pretty sad when it ended. It&#039;s one of those iconic animes that you just kinda have to experience.<br />
<br />
Story was pretty basic, but there wasn&#039;t really much of one overall. Ecchis are definitely not made to be story heavy so I was not expecting much anyway. The majority was just fanservice, but this show is a lot more tame and enjoyable than it&#039;s first season. For the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330445">
        story that there was, I quite liked it. I really liked the unique ways they came up with with helping Keita study for his exams. Yes, it has a basic story but it has an odd charm to it. The comedy was also pretty good. I really enjoyed that side of it, and I don&#039;t tend to like comedies.<br />
<br />
Art was pretty. The characters were designed pretty well, though there was not much variation in design (they all had the same sort of face with just different hair). Despite this, the backgrounds were nice and colourful, very good to look at.<br />
<br />
Sound was alright. The character&#039;s seiyuu were very good at their role, even though that resulted in making me pretty uncomfortable at times haha. OP and ED, I have to say, were amazing. Not sure why, but ecchis are really known to have amazing OP and ED, at least in my experience. Great songs and visuals.<br />
<br />
Characters were pretty basic, but that&#039;s to be expected in an ecchi, fanservice driven anime. I did quite like them all, and they were all pretty cute and easy to like. I especially liked the comedic war between the twins over Keita.<br />
<br />
Overall, it certainly isn&#039;t a bad show. I quite enjoyed the little story there was, and the ecchi scenes were not very explicit like the first season. If you can get past the incest aspect, then I think it is a show that is quite worth watching for the comedy alone. I guess the ecchi fanservice is also a bonus if you&#039;re into it.
