    Conception is a harem anime where our main swagnator gets a mission to save the world. How does he do this then? By making a baby with every girl he meats, of course! <br />
<br />
The story is highly comedic and the writing mainly relies on episodic events where the swag-bro hits on new girl/girls just to commit &quot;love-ritual&quot; or, like a more poetic person would say, &quot; fuck dem bitches.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl variety is great (there is like 10+ of them) and all of them naturally fall for the bro-nator because he is such a hero. There is a girl with split-personality who is adorable, tanned

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296897">
        cat-girl who is ridiculously sexy, and a cousin person too because how can man call himself a Man if he can&#039;t even make relatives suck his cock. Some other girls are pretty okay too, others less interesting.<br />
<br />
The character design is rather unique and also varies greatly and most girls are more of the pure, comfy side since the series is more comedic than pushy fanservice. There is practically no ecchi which is great because that only shows how much harder it is for the mc to get these girls worship him and achieve his goals. <br />
<br />
Production was okay. Girls did good job with their voice acting, blushy blushes were inserted to make the most crucial moments extra happy, etc. Smart decisions. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment-wise, I found this series to be quite funny and cute. I honestly don&#039;t get what most people were expecting. In my opinion, series such as these should be judged based to what they aim to do, and as a harem series, this most definitely achieved everything it wanted to.

    This is one of the worst damn animes to be premiered in the recent past.<br />
<br />
It has nothing going for it. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s not hentai. It&#039;s not ecchi. It&#039;s not fap material. It&#039;s not cute. Or sexy. Or hot. Or interesting. Or worthwhile.<br />
<br />
This whole anime is generic. The girls, the main character and the setting that it takes place in.<br />
<br />
MC gets sucked in to fight against impurities by creating babies with virgin maidens. Yes. That is as bad as it sounds.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend you skipping this anime as even downloading and going at x4 is not worth the 7-8 minutes of concentration required to parse this anime.<br />

    Damn. Seriously, God damn. Conception, you really made me wonder if there’s a ceiling of just how terrible a show can really be. I should say right off the bat that video game adaptations these days rarely make the break for an audience. But here we are in 2018 and we got a show about pregnancy. That’s right, a show that literally has a plot about pregnant characters and an insufferable protagonist.<br />
<br />
I have not played the original PSP exclusive game. There’s actually a remaster coming out for the PS4 but that’s not on my bucket list either. 2019 has way too many great games for

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296797">
        me to care about this. But the real question is if you should give a damn about the anime adaptation known as Conception.<br />
<br />
In the medical world, conception is pretty much the action of conceiving a child through. Bear in mind that the show is branded with this premise as it’s pretty much the selling concept. The catch now is that Itsuki has to form relationships with “Star Maidens” after being transported into this world known as “Granvania”. The show pretty much dedicates to Itsuki’s quest to produce Star Children in the hope of restoring order. I get it. The premise of the show is absurd and you may be confused on how to approach this. The simple answer is to just let go. I mean, let go of your inner thoughts and watch this with some popcorn. It’s pretty much a show that’s so bad that it has potential to be the worst of the year.<br />
<br />
But damn, is it really as abysmal as it sounds? Maybe you should stop judging the cover and watch it with an open mind! I wish. Challenging myself to watch Conception is like taking on the second round of Fear Factor. It tested my mental limits to wonder how much I can watch this without puking. But it wouldn’t be fair to say that Conception is really the worst anime of the year. After all, it may have some potential with its cast of stars? Well, let’s take a look. The main protagonist is Itsuki Yuge, a high school student without a big goal in his life. There’s nothing remarkable about him until we find out his role early in this show. Not to mention, I could say Itsuki is like a puppet. He does the job assigned to him despite feeling conflicted. I should mention that Itsuki is a good person at heart but someone that doesn’t fit with a popular crowd. He’s pretty much just a normal guy with an abnormal task of forming relationships with the Star Maidens. This brings in the question of just how much we should expect his relationships will develop. The easy way to look at this is the plot structure. It has 12 episodes so naturally, common logic dictates that he’d get at least one episode with each girl. Well, not exactly. In some episodes, he tames not one but two! I’m not going to go into details but every episode’s title that has “child” in it should make them sound obvious.<br />
<br />
The Star Maidens themselves consists of 12 different girls with each of their distinctive personalities. From whatever the creators had in mind, it seems every girl represents a textbook personality that you’ll recognize. Some like Mahiru is the typical friendly girl next door type. Others like Femiruna display a degree of aristocratic mannerisms because of their social status. We even have a girl with split personality in the form of Liris and Lirie. But I don’t think any of these really traits matter. The real question we should ask ourselves is if we should care about them. Quite frankly, it’s a big fat no. Let’s face it, this show not only has an intolerable plot but also suffers from pacing. The early episodes quickly dives into every character relationships in the most straightforward way possible. There’s no buildup, little emotions, and lack of charisma. Instead, we get Itsuki and his robotic-like dialogues that saturates the series. It gets painfully awkward to watch when we also get a mascot character taking the form of a talking bear. You may initially see as a cute addition to the show but don’t let a character like Mana fool you. Behind that cute flying animal’s appearance is perhaps the most perverted character in the entire series. It seems he tries to get every chance for Itsuki to commit to the Star Maidens in the most ludicrous way as possible. In some episodes, it seems Mana has developed a strange attraction towards Itsuki himself. At that point, I pretty much stopped questioning the logic of the show.   <br />
<br />
So a question emerges if there’s anything redeemable about Conception at all. Well, I wish. Gonzo is known for some of their more aesthetic works but from this show, you won’t see that. What you get instead is poor animation quality that looks like something from a hentai. I took a look at some footage from the original game and this anime didn’t make the characters look any better. It honestly looked like a show made in the PS2 era with outdated visual quality. And of course, sexual fantasies is all over the place. Expect a lot of scenes in the bedroom as it is part of the “plot”. Can you believe it? Conception has a plot! Normally, I’d make a joke about “watching this for the plot” but by the end of the show, that joke wouldn’t even be half funny.  <br />
<br />
After watching Conception, I probably also lost a good dozen amount of brain cells. I’m an avid fan of roleplaying games but Conception is pretty much the worst example of being in such a category. It could have been something to satirize the fan service norm or a cleverly crafted parody. What we get instead is an abomination buried by Gonzo and the insufferable character cast. I wish there was something positive to say about this anime honestly. But seriously, if you want to save some brain cells, then stay far away from this atrocity.

    TL;DR Review<br />
<br />
Unwatchable, literally unwatchable. No one is insane enough to watch something like this. Where do I start? The plot is horrible, I mean, getting your cousin pregnant so that you can create babies to fight in a dungeon? The jokes aren&#039;t that funny; the raccoon flying creature thingy isn&#039;t funny. To be honest, it&#039;s kind of annoying. Heck, if this was hentai, it would be much more interesting. At least a 5; BUT IT&#039;S NOT! The character development is horrible, the plot&#039;s terrible, and fight scenes are pretty lame. Main character doesn&#039;t know how to fight, but as soon as he touches a sword,

    Well...<br />
<br />
This anime is a shame, a lot of wasted potential, forcing the echi and hurrying the story, giving little time to develop the characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
With 4ep at the moment: pathetic<br />
The story start decent, a few combat, some echi elements, a romance that seems to be from long time... and then...everything becomes senseless.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
The art is decent for the common anime we have today<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
-<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
Here, we have a lot of characters, 12 zodiacal sign + childrens + main and secondarys, all seems to be diferent from each other with some history behind and powers, but with the tiny time on screen of each, focusing on &quot;mana&quot; (the pervert squirrel/red

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293030">
        panda) and Itsuki it&#039;s a real waste<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I&#039;m not nejoy this anime, the character &quot;mana&quot; is really anoying for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Again, it&#039;s a shame and waste<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will update this as the story progresses

    WTF did I just watched...<br />
<br />
Do you remember Spike Chunsoft, the same company that brought us the beloved Danganronpa and Mystery Dungeon series? Well...they also made this series, and left it in glorious Japan, where Nippons loved the hell outta it and got a sequel (released globally). And...to both shock and amazement, it actually was well-received!<br />
<br />
And, now we turn the clock to the series that is the well-trashy anime adaptation by Gonzo of the first game...<br />
<br />
The story from what I can tell is unchanged from the game itself: the player (or in this case, Visitor Itsuki Yuge) has to flirt with the 12 constellational girls (erm

          <span style="display: none;" id="review296800">
        I mean, maidens, sorry...) in order to &quot;give birth&quot; to Star Children, which in turn, Itsuki takes them to seemingly random dungeons to fight evil beings known as &quot;Impurities&quot; to save the world of Granvania. Here&#039;s where the controversial divided opinion starts. Despite the Itsuki X constellational maidens set-up, they don&#039;t necessarily need sex in order to give birth, but &quot;pour energy&quot; (or the &quot;Love Ritual&quot;) into these maidens so that their Star Children matches the powers that each maiden have to aid Itsuki in his quest. And...based on that aforementioned setup, it looks and feels like a censored hentai in almost every way (Heck, why NOT make this a hentai in the first place, that would be better!) Maybe it the &quot;It&#039;s NOT an eroge&quot; baby-making pitch that made people think otherwise, and in this unfortunate case, in the hands of School Days director Keitaro Motonaga and the people over at Gonzo. And...it&#039;s a trashy masterpiece in its own right that can be best matched up to the glory that is School Days itself.<br />
<br />
I really don&#039;t give two Fs about the characters as well. For one, Itsuki Yuge the Visitor himself, not only was he being summoned to fight against the Impurities as the last hope for Granvania, but dragging along his cousin Mahiru, who seemed to be &quot;pregnant&quot; with his Star Child, and all the way through, he was there just for the sole mission of process-eliminating Impurities so that Granvania can be prosperous again. Otherwise, he&#039;s just bland, unlikeable and a sore thumb to look at. Same goes for the 12 constellational maidens, throughout the series we get some backstory about their lives, and it&#039;s for that reason that they exist to help Itsuki on the &quot;give birth&quot; side of things. (Spoilers) Not to mention that Alfie, being the extra maiden (literally &quot;extra&quot;), that was when the entire show took a nosedive for the worst. I&#039;d appreciate her sense of literally being the caregiver for the Star Children, nurturing their growth so that Itsuki can utilize their powers to fend of evilwarts, but anything else than that, it&#039;s a direct rejection. Easily the most annoying is Mana the perverted sub-jestic raccoon whom is always acting for Itsuki&#039;s naughty and weird antics that it becomes a chore to listen to it everytime in relation to Itsuki. But thank God it&#039;s the final boss, and so to speak, defeating it is mission accomplished.<br />
<br />
And...not to mention the almost drab looking art and animation. I know that Gonzo isn&#039;t one of the studios to count on for quality anime, but it at least presented a good chunk of art that&#039;s resemblance to the game aestethics itself. I have no idea how it comapres to the game, so for those who have played the game, judge and compare with your own eyes. Animation is very minimal for the most part, as it just involves some fighting action, mostly lustful love-sex moments and Mana&#039;s direct-indirect love-guru movements over and over in repeat.<br />
<br />
And oh God the music. I&#039;ve gotta say that the music really just subverts expectations of the show itself. Nano&#039;s OP is just as great, although her new song &quot;Star light, Star bright&quot; is a departure from her usual reprtiore of songs, she has indicated that this song is for the light happy moments, so good for her, it still is one to remember. Same goes with well established VA-cum-musician Manani Numakura with the ED as well. If there&#039;s an area of good impressions, it will always be the music, and it doesn&#039;t disappoint.<br />
<br />
In the end, how I wished this was an eroge to begin with, when you have enough evidence of &quot;giving birth&quot;, endless amount of flirting and whatnot, if it was designed that way it would have been a moderate success, just with more censoring. Alas, what we got was a series that had given its base up since the beginning, and as a result, created one of the most trashiest anime of the year. Stay far away from this one if you desire hentai levels of enjoyment, or not anime in general.

    UPDATED REVIEW:<br />
<br />
Just a second, please don&#039;t judge me!<br />
<br />
I know what you must be thinking, why is some random stupid ass guy rating this anime 10. You must be thinking what is this guy smoking... <br />
<br />
Alright, alright stay calm. I&#039;ll give you a short summary of my review before you judge me. Spare me some of your minutes, won&#039;t take long - I hope.<br />
<br />
Story (4):<br />
I know it is a pretty shit story, like straight away out of nowhere Mahiru says she&#039;s pregnant. Uhm ok... That&#039;s a crazy start, now you wonder who&#039;s the lucky b*stard who impregnated her. Suddenly, like literary out of nowhere they get

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299444">
        sent to another world. Oh boy, cliche Isekai shit right there. Once they reach another world, Mahiru confesses that there was no father of the baby and makes you wonder what drugs is she taking. No father??? How can that be possible? Another Jesus??? Then, it turns out there was no baby in the first place. It just some syndrome that similar pregnancy, like hello??? Who wrote this shit??? <br />
<br />
Then the main character gets told to mate with 12 Star Maidens which are all based on zodiacs including his cousin Mahiru to produce a  Star Child and save the world. Hmmmm? Makes you think will this turn into Hentai or Borderline Hentai like Shinmai no Testament or Masou Gakuen HXH. Alright alright, calm down guys now is not the time. Before you get excited, listen to what I have to say, don&#039;t you dare skip this part!!! I guess this is where most people got their hopes up. <br />
<br />
Majority of you must be thinking at this point about enjoying the lewd scenes. Guess what? You get fooled! They censor it using the curtains and weird shiny lights and chibis etc. All Itsuki requires to do is body contact with a Star Maiden and that&#039;s about it! Outta nowhere poof (that&#039;s the actual sound effect); a star child is produced. Like a grown up toddler appears outta nowhere. No need for intercourse or anything, a simple body contact is enough!!! Whoa... Mind blown!!! Are you still excited now??? Plus, as the episode progresses; you don&#039;t know what goes on behind the curtains... The story is so simple minded and cliche, but I think its good change to most anime adaption. If you are a person that don&#039;t expect much then you might as well watch this. <br />
<br />
If not then sorry for wasting your time... Apologies for long paragraph for the story section too.<br />
<br />
Art (8):<br />
The Art was decent in my experience, the characters look pretty and background was nicely done too. I don&#039;t really sense much of laziness in art. Its fairly done. That&#039;s something nice done for this anime. I mean the story might be shit but you need a charm point as well on something. <br />
<br />
Sound (10):<br />
Conception reminds me of those type of anime or games where they invest more on the sound itself than the story. The OST was really nice to hear and relaxing. Every scene they had a particular OST, it synced perfectly. I am kinda bias since I watch it at night. I think you might change your perspective if you watch it at night. Maybe it just me but watching Conception at night may be better than watching at day or afternoon. Of course, many people sleep or do something else a night hehe... Lets not go into deep details. Anyway back to the the main topic, the sound is pretty well invested. <br />
<br />
Regarding to the OP song, Starlight Starbright by nano is great song. It has a good tune to it, simply cannot skip this opening. Some of you must be fan of nano thinking her song is wasted on this shit anime. Its ok... It happens... It happens...<br />
<br />
Character (8):<br />
At least our main character isn&#039;t dense- well not too dense until last few remaining episode! Amazing right? My boy Itsuki doesn&#039;t hesitate or act too dense. He&#039;s doing all this baby making for the sake of the world! Plus, the racoon-bear mascot thing is damn hilarious, a pervy racoon which you could probably befriend with it. I would, to be honest ahaha. The 12 Star Maidens are also cute and pretty also references to the Art. Each Star Maidens have a unique personality you&#039;ll love. This may also relate to sound; the voice actresses all suit their character roles as well. Great job to Conception staff for hiring great voice actresses. Which is pleasant to see and hear. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9):<br />
I enjoy Conception despite it being a shit story, which starts up weird and then you already know how it will end or progress. It hilarious to see that, sometimes you just want an anime that gives no shit about the plot - not referencing most of Gintama (When will it end? Ahahaha. Keep it up Gorilla-sensei, don&#039;t end it now). Also, Mana (the racoon bear thing) makes the anime even more funny to watch. Mana says the weirdest things possible and sets up the most cliche plans for main character to hook up with the girls. I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s horrible but so interesting to watch... Thank you Mana... I liked the ending too, bit of a spoiler but it was expected ending. Last episode of Conception was literary a roller-coaster. It was nice ride I guess...<br />
<br />
Overall (10):<br />
I mean I have no right to complain about other people&#039;s opinion, since they are not right nor wrong. But in people&#039;s perspective this anime deserves a 6, yes I have seen other reviews that are given rating of 1 or 2 its harsh but its their opinion you shouldn&#039;t really hate them. Plus try watching this at night, I think it will give you a different experience or maybe not. Since no one can disturb you and you are relaxed setting up a pleasant experience. <br />
<br />
Misc:<br />
As some of you know I made a preliminary review before for Conception around episode 4 I guess, I&#039;d like thank you again for rating my old review helpful. 79 found it helpful!!! To me that is a big accomplishment! Yesterday some person came to me and asked to update my review since it wasn&#039;t visible in the main page of Conception. I didn&#039;t really had intention to but his/her message was really great to hear. So here I am again! <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for reading.<br />
<br />

    This is the story of how your average high school boy saves the world by spreading his seed.<br />
<br />
Conception is an isekai made for viewers who just want to sit back and jack off without any actual hentai on hand (HOW UNFORTUNATE!). The story starts with typical protag, named Itsuki, being whisked away to the world of Granvania after his cousin tells him that she&#039;s preggers after spending three years doing &quot;all sorts of stuff&quot; together. As per se, Granvania is ravaged by a great evil that only Visitors like Itsuki can save them from by creating 12 Star Children with 12 Star Maidens. How are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293185">
        these Star Children created, you ask?<br />
<br />
How do you think?<br />
<br />
This show knows its audience, and they actual do it pretty well without breaking into hentai land. Can&#039;t stand staring at girls&#039; faces while they talk? This show has them talking out of their ass instead. Even the opening just consists of nothing but bits of shadowy missionary positions and shiny ass cheeks. When MC gets transported to another world with his cousin, you see Itsuki&#039;s whole entire body being sucked in while his cousin just gets a skirt shot- NO PANTY SHOTS FOR YOU! (at least, not yet) <br />
<br />
Feeling 50 Shades of Greyish? Check out the perverted mascot, Red Bondage Panda Raccoon thing. He&#039;s annoying but he likes watching people get frisky- what more could you want?<br />
<br />
Would this show do better as an actual hentai, you ask? Well yes- absolutely yes. But the fact that it&#039;s not doesn&#039;t stop it from being ridiculously entertaining, whether it be laughing your bottom off at all the virgin sex, or just making you say &quot;wtf am I watching?&quot; an eyebrow raising amount of times over this life changing animu.

    Conception is an anime that transcends being not bad, not so bad it&#039;s good or just decent but it transcends to a place where I&#039;ve seen no other Anime go (yet). Despite this anime being so bad it doesn&#039;t register on the scale for awfulness, it given me some good. After watching this anime and getting sucked into it&#039;s black hole of awfulness, I&#039;ve started to put my life under the microscope, and it&#039;s inspired me to finally climb out of this chasm, go to the gym and lose 600 pounds. As of today, I have a six pack, a job and a girlfriend. Evidently,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358846">
        watching this anime has changed my life, and I believe showing this to other people like your Mom or Dad could make even accelerate the cure for cancer, coronavirus and save the world from climate change.

    When one guy says that this was more of a &quot; baby-making JRPG series&quot; then he&#039;s very much right, cu&#039;z this is what this anime for.....the plot in more simplistic term just suck, it just a guy from another world with his cousin who arrive in some place called &quot;Granvania&quot; that has all the magic and tech and yet has to rely on an ordinary guy to do the fighting for them. From there , it becomes a guy having to supposed make babies called &quot;Star Children&quot; from each girls who represent certain constellation, what make it worse was the addition of a 13th constellation

        that should even exist , man them Japs alawys have the stupid notion that adding an extra would make the story plot good , like what they did with  Rokka no Yuusha where there should be 6 heroes but they  added a 7th which makes the anime&#039;s title a sham.......The only thing good about this anime was the eye candy around here and yes they&#039;re the harem members, that compose of 3 MILFs , 3 Lolis and 4 same age girls, oh and let&#039;s not forget the girl that used to be a plushy. I would have given this anime a 7 if the guy ends up with his cousin and them girls and star children stayed behind and lets not forget the addition of a 14 harem member that used to be a talking flying plushy that become a human girl right after it followed the harem to the guy&#039;s world. Ya know I really soo hate this anime that mentioning the characters name is like calling me names. So no more BS and here is how I rate this shit. <br />
<br />
Story: pathetic 1: One of studio Gonzo&#039;s worse anime after Rosario + vampire. <br />
<br />
Art: Good 7- It was the only silver lining in this anime cu&#039;z of the eye candies. <br />
<br />
Sound: fair 6-  Coz&#039; I don&#039;t give a fuck as to who did who. <br />
<br />
Character: pathetic 1- Like I&#039;ve said I sooooo hate this anime and the character that mentioning it was just like bad words.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Pathetic 1- Very predictable and you only need to watch the 1st 3 episodes and the last 2 episodes, everything else , U jaz skip. <br />
<br />
Overall: Pathetic 1- This would have been better off as a hentai than anything else. Hate to say it ,  but this was probably director Motonaga Keitarou&#039;s worse project ever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas.   <br />

    Conception is the shittiest anime of 2018 (and remember, this year also had Pop Team Epic). But I need to be fair: watching the show was an unforgettable, incredible mindblowing experience.<br />
The truth is, it&#039;s an awful anime. The plot is absurd, the rules are constantly changing, the sexual jokes are awfully bad, and nothing makes sense. On a technical note, the animation starts correctly, but drops steadily down to the point where it&#039;s not even animated anymore.<br />
<br />
So how come I enjoyed it? What&#039;s enjoyable?<br />
<br />
The main point is, the show is incredible and mindblowing because it&#039;s highly unpredictable. The whole thing is, the show tries its

          <span style="display: none;" id="review307847">
        best to imagine the most absurd way to put two people together in a bed. And when I say &quot;absurd&quot; I mean &quot;having the man wear a costume of sausage and the girl wear a costume of hot-dog bread&quot;, or making a whole TV show inside the universe for the MC to pick a girl with sushi degustation, to decide with who he will have babies with. Yeah I didn&#039;t talk about it because it&#039;s not really important anyway, the MC needs to have babies with lots of females characters by spending a night in a bed with them (and, like, cuddle, no sexual intercourse) but honestly that&#039;s completely besides the point.<br />
<br />
Then, what I listed in the beginning are minuses when you&#039;re talking about an true anime, with people that want to give a real show to their audience. I respect that. But it&#039;s not the project here. Here, it&#039;s clear that no one, not a single human being in the studio, give a fsck of what&#039;s going on. Instead of watching an anime, you&#039;re watching the byproduct of a whole team in the middle of their delirium.<br />
The scene makes no sense? Let&#039;s use it twice! Three times! Four times and let&#039;s cut it in the middle of it because we know no ones gives a shit. Who cares at that point if characters are not even closing/opening their mouth when talking, let&#039;s just skip these frames and keep their mouths open. Let&#039;s move that racoon up and down along a straight line, who cares. Let&#039;s scribble that scene like it&#039;s on fscking MS PAINT. And the beauty of it is, not only do the animators not give a shit of what they&#039;re doing, but so do the characters. It&#039;s not like they break the 4th wall, there&#039;s none to begin with. It&#039;s just, hey the studio doesn&#039;t care so why should we?<br />
<br />
Honestly, it is the worst show of the year, but somehow ends up being so insane, so unpredictable, that it gets fascinating and (if you&#039;re like me) hilarious to watch. If you share the mindset of madness the show offers, try it. Don&#039;t trust the beginning too much, it really takes off after several episodes. But you&#039;ll never forget it, that&#039;s for sure.

    The only thing that I actually like about this show is that I finished it.<br />
<br />
The story featured in this anime is so dog-shit, I honestly found it amusing. I never thought that in my life a show this bad would be released.<br />
<br />
The story is based around a guy who has to have sex with every girl in the god damn plot line to win. That&#039;s about all I got from this show.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s sad that not even one of the characters could support the plot line either, every single character was like an empty shell. This show is not attractive ecchi, it&#039;s the type of story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326622">
        I would hear during a stand up comedy.<br />
<br />
Like a company actually put money into making this anime, it&#039;s hard to think someone was paid to produce this piece of shit.

    Spoilers alert - I came across this anime with the concept (no puns intended) that the mc is supposed to save the world by copulating with different girls to create star children. Thought the plot was like date a live, hence I decided to give it a try.<br />
<br />
The beginning of the story although seemed rushed, was passable as an intro to the world which the mc and his friend were teleport to. Even if it was never explained why they were chosen I could understand as it is to move the story along.<br />
<br />
I felt that things took a down hill turn when the character of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309974">
        the flying raccoon was introduced. It’s sole purpose was to assist the mc win over the girls he was supposed to consummate with, instead the ironic thing was it was co*k blocking the mc most of the time so much so that It irritated me enough to not bother what was it’s name.<br />
<br />
The mc was fairing better on his own and I felt that the writers of this anime wrote in the flying raccoon character for comedic effect but this backfired. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the writers, I felt they where lazy for not including the fight scenes with the impurities. Instead they had the flying raccoon appear when the fight was about to begin and it proclaim that the mc had defeated the impurity. Either that or they will show the last part where the mc already defeated the impurities.<br />
<br />
There was an episode when everyone went to the beach, the writers introduced a “playboy” character whom seemed genuinely wanting to chase all the girls but just because there already is a goody two shoes mc, wasn’t considered that he could have been someone whom could produce star children with the girls thus helping his own home world. Correct me if I am wrong but isn’t the whole plot of the anime is to save the world by creating more star children via consummating with the girls? Since there is a willing character, why couldn’t he assist the mc seeing that the mc has difficulty accomplishing this task on his own? Why wasn’t this playboy character not considered even as a side kick to the mc? Only explanation I can think of is to make the mc look cool fending off someone whom is deemed threatening to his harem. Even so, the writers could have cast the playboy as a minor villain instead the playboy character just disappeared during an episode. His only purpose in that episode was to create a misunderstanding scenario so that the mc could take over to consummate with that girl in the episode. Later at the end of that episode, the writers decided to give the playboy screen time but made him hint that he is actually gay for the mc!<br />
<br />
Overall, I felt this anime had lots of potential given the premise that mc’s role is to save the world via consummating with different girls ala date a live. However, at least date a live stayed true to it’s own synopsis plus it also has acceptable actions scenes. After finishing conception, I was left wondering is this anime slice of live, they show a lot of the mc helping out the girls in their daily live situations. Is it a comedy, the writers tried hard to make the audience laugh via that annoying flying raccoon cracking lame jokes and such. Is this supposed to be action as the premise is to defeat the impurities to save the world however there is little to no fight scenes. Is it supposed to be harem, but isn’t the premise of harem supposed to have the girls fawning over the mc because they liked him? Conception only has cameos of the girls that the mc already conquered, other than that they are never seen or mentioned.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that conception should have stick to being a dating anime whereby each episode be an arc which is dedicated to how the mc win over each girl. This was done till episode 8 (which I felt was the best episode in the entire series hence i gave it 1 point more to make it 2/10). After episode eight instead of making each episode be an arc for each girl, the writer rush and condense two girls in one episode making the mc win them over via a game show and not really properly showing the girl’s back story of how the mc win over their heart  (another sign of laziness).<br />
<br />
Only to dedicate the last four episodes to having different “plot twist” stating that there is an extra 13 “girl” the mc must win over who turned out to be either the playboy in the earlier episode, the king or the spectacle guy. Heck the writers even got the annoying flying raccoon to literally tell the mc that it is a plot twist and that either the playboy, the king or the spectacle guy is who the mc is supposed to win over.<br />
<br />
But no, one plot twist is not enough, turns out the initial plot twist is a plot twist  itself as the playboy, king and spectacle guy wanted the mc to level up by accepting guys. The next plot twist turned out to be the side character being the 13th girl and the annoying flying raccoon is also a girl.<br />
<br />
Overall, this anime could have been decent had the writers stick to making this as a dating anime. 2/10

    WARNING: This is a big rant and contains spoilers of the show. Hope you can enjoy the review.<br />
<br />
Growing in the mid-2000s, I believe some of you still watched anime thanks to that magic box called Television. One of the channels that I remember the most was a channel called Animax. Animax brought a lot of shows from Gonzo, things like Black Cat, Saikano, The First Hellsing, Gantz, Burst Angel, you named it, Gonzo had their name slapped on the credit sequences. <br />
<br />
After a long time, I haven’t heard about those guys lately so I decided to check out if they even were still active and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306550">
        they still are, and it seems that they put out one of the worst shows from last year, although knowing the fact that I watched Ladyspo In its entirety,  I doubt that there would be something worst that came out in 2018 but it surely does make a competition. <br />
<br />
The first thing I must say from this animation is that Conception has to be one of the dumbest premises I have ever heard. The premise is that these 2 teenagers who are cousins and whose names I forgot because of how godawful this show is, are transported to this next dimension. Yeah, we start with this trend of going to another dimension like if it is something revolutionary in these days when things like Digimon already did it 2 decades ago and other shows even before Digimon did it too. So, our main protagonist arrives, and some demon spirit comes out of his cousin and a sword comes from him and he defeats the demon without issues.<br />
After the fight it is revealed that the seals that appeared on them showed up because the cliché of you are the chosen ones to save our world. But he can not do it alone, and the reason is because, again the power up in this show is so idiotic.<br />
<br />
He must have sexual relationships with these 12 girls, and one of them being his cousin, these other girls also have these seals so he could breed kids called stellar children and they will protect the city because some labyrinths are causing troubles in this world. First thing I must say:<br />
<br />
THIS PREMISE IS SO STUPID!!!<br />
<br />
And after the unbearable first episode the show makes a big U-turn in the next episodes because the producers of this forgot what the main focus of the story was or maybe I am missing something for not playing the game, but it turns out that expecting the main protagonist fighting with a sword and the Star Children it was just a clickbait and the show becomes this stupid harem about how our protagonist seduces all those 12 girls, oops I mean 13 because there is one that changes personalities if she gets hit on the head.<br />
<br />
I have to say this<br />
WHY WASN’T THIS A HENTAI?<br />
 <br />
If this was a hentai, I wouldn’t have wasted my time in watching this because it tries to be a hentai so hard. They put so much effort into “developing” these relationships for you to see the protagonist and the girls getting into it. Really this is the type of crap Studio Seven should be producing and not Gonzo who has done Welcome to the NHK for god’s sake. <br />
<br />
And you have it all here, you have trios, you have bondage, you have lolicon with food fetish, you have furry girls, you named it, heck and with Japan always you must add incest with this sort of crap.<br />
<br />
Another thing I must add to this show is that self-awareness doesn’t make a show instantly funny. This talking tanuki-bear thing has to remind us every time that if we don’t understand anything, we must enter to their website to get all the glimpse of the parts we don’t understand. That is just a big fail in my book for even trying to engage with the viewer.<br />
<br />
After the protagonist finishes with his quest with the 12 girls there is revelation that there is another one that he must bang and that girl is the one that is taking care of all the children he had, and that idiot tanuki pulls out a horrible Deadpool wanna be like: “Didn’t you watch the opening sequence, it was obvious!!!”<br />
<br />
The way they try to do comedy is simply awful and cringy to even make you have a chuckle with this arse of dialogue. This show is stupid that they even advertise themselves with the cover of the PS4 game appearing on the same show. <br />
<br />
So you develop an anime to advertise a game but within the animated advertisement you decide to add the game itself?<br />
Honestly why these video game companies can&#039;t make a very good animated advertisement of the games they want to sell instead of these poor adaptations that go nowhere and simply add more trash to the over saturation anime has?<br />
Also they had an episode where they do a copy and paste the Bachelor and I am just wondering, does this town even need to be saved if they have time for doing this reality tv crap?<br />
<br />
One more thing from this show is that they added a filler episode about finding this 13th person, because the protagonist wasn’t sure if it could a male or a female but the tanuki tries to pull off a “It’s just a prank dude” to just say the 13th person is the girl that kindergardens the stellar children.<br />
Who wrote the script for this? Did they even checked what the hell they were writing?<br />
<br />
The worst part from this show are the characters but one of them that really I wanted to grab a gun and freaking shut his mouth was the Tanuki. Oh My Gawd, this thing is a pain to the ears. This character is the definition of a try hard comedian. He is like those boys at school that find about something related to sex and they tell the same joke over and over and over until someone shuts them. This character was created so desperately to make you laugh but fails miserably with the poor attempts of self-awareness, 4th wall and sex jokes.<br />
<br />
The main protagonist is simply a fuckboy, he at first thinks that this compromise is hard for him and thinks that is not great to have sexual relationships with his cousin at first but then the character goes on a 360 and doesn’t care anymore and he will do it with anything and I mean it ANYTHING, he does so much that in the end he has relationships with the freaking tanuki.  Yeah there is even bestiality in this thing. <br />
<br />
Finally, the girls, and the only thing I can say is that they are sex objects. Sorry but no sorry this is what they do in the show, they are bland as hell and you can only remember for their unidimensional characteristics and maybe their zodiac signs but that’s it. I can’t say more of uncharismatic characters.<br />
<br />
The art and animation are simply boring. It is so below average; the faces all look the same except with different colors. The Stellar Kids look like retarded forms of Yokai Watch characters. The backgrounds are lifeless, and the pseudo battles we have in this show are quick and without action. The only thing that they seemed to waste the animation was on the ending credits with annoying tanuki moving in a weird way, which I could say it is the only good thing from this crapfest. Honestly Gonzo what happened to you? Even if you did crap like Rosario + Vampire the freaking art style and animation was beautiful, How did these guys get so low in the animation industry?<br />
<br />
The music is also so out of touch. They throw melodramatic songs here and there, but it feels so forced because the characters being so simplistic doesn’t help with the situations they are  and the voice actors can’t redeem these characters, they sound so boring and they just tell the stuff without emotion, nothing, you could replace it with text to speech program and you could make these characters have a soul that they don’t have and the credit songs are generic as hell that you want to skip just to not make the pain longer.<br />
<br />
The ending is a big middle finger for trying to have drama. So our main protagonist has to sacrifice himself to save this not dangerous town from a monster in a labyrinth and he needs the help of the 13 girls and the 13 children, but the 13th girl dies so he gets a boost in power by doing a Maximum Evolution like in Digimon Tammers and he combines himself with the children to become an abhorrent copy of Gallantmon and they save this world but the Stellar Children also die in that sacrifice, so he goes back home with his cousin but all the girls follow him and even the girl that died for some reason that I don’t know comes back to life, simply I give up in trying process the plot of this thing.<br />
<br />
My final thoughts on Conception. This is a poor attempt on making someone play the game. Honestly if this supposed to be an RPG then why don’t you show the action of it instead of this “I must have all the waifus max out excrement? Everything is so dull but so annoying. I even had to reproduce the final episodes in 2x faster because it was intolerable to watch this in complete 24 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is everything from my part. This is kevsan, thanks for taking your time in reading this. English is not my first language but I try my best.

    We meet our protagonist, Itsuki, with a scene where his cousin bares all about her pregnancy after several years of hot incest action... But it&#039;s all a joke, as she is a virgin... and ultimately finds out she isn&#039;t even pregnant. Our perfect, handsome, awesome protagonist and his cousin are then transferred to a magical alternate reality where he finds out he is TEH LEGENDAREH CHOZUN WAHN. Chosen for what exactly? Chosen to dry hump the shit out of the 12 most generic, cliche ass women, including his cousin, in all the kingdom in order to instantly produce demonic half human, half furry, half pokemon

    This Anime is something kinda mysterious to me. I don&#039;t know how to describe it well.<br />
<br />
The Story is tottaly funny yet very rushed. Itsuki(Protagonist) devolops relationships with the Heroines way too quiclky, but it doesn&#039;t bothers me. <br />
<br />
Characters like Mana are extremely funny and exaggerated, Her ways of incerting sexual things even when someone is deeply sad, is giving me a bless of a time.<br />
<br />
The Soundtrack is excellent and really gives a feeling of importance to the Protagonist&#039;s actions.<br />
<br />
The art is very good for today&#039;s standards.<br />
<br />
The characters are funny and each one has an interesting backstory although they are really quickly shown, you can connect

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294830">
        with the characters.<br />
<br />
i only gave it a 10 because i felt something special about this anime. if you don&#039;t think it deserves a 10, well that&#039;s on you.

    Dreadful writing. Main Character tries to be lovable but ends up being a tool and a creep, but the female characters - with whom he must conceive &quot;star children&quot; - still fall for him anyway. Little about how the characters interact makes sense. Little about how the MC gets the girls to fall for him makes sense. Forgettable dialogue and some questionable jokes. Seems to think of itself as an edgier TWGOK but falls flat on every account. I wanted to enjoy it, and I&#039;ve given it the benefit of the doubt so far, but after 6 episodes I don&#039;t see any reason to continue

    Conception is, quite frankly, an anime that should not exist. From what I understand, it&#039;s based on an eroge game, and the anime makes sure you understand that, with the mascot character (an extremely perverted tanuki) often breaking the fourth wall and telling the audience to visit the game&#039;s website for details about things that never get explained in the anime.<br />
<br />
Conception is supposed to be a harem anime in which your typical bland male protagonist seduces twelve women (actually thirteen, but that doesn&#039;t happen until close to the very end) in order to create &quot;star children&quot;, little chibis that are supposed to help the protagonist

          <span style="display: none;" id="review358885">
        clear the twelve labyrinths, which are filled with creatures called Impurities. <br />
<br />
The twelve maidens are based on the Zodiac, with some of them having a couple of traits that might help identify which constellation they&#039;re supposed to symbolize. But really, they&#039;re all interchangeable. Even after twelve episodes, I can&#039;t remember any of their names, and very few of their identifying traits. There&#039;s one girl who changes personalities when hit on the head, one who likes baking bread, one who is a secret Domme, one who hates being around people and likes to sleep in a coffin, one who is a researcher, one who runs a bar, one who loves animals...and that&#039;s about all I can remember.<br />
<br />
The girls do have some interesting and unique designs, but even then, they&#039;re so bland and generic that you forget who they are immediately after seeing them.<br />
<br />
What&#039;s more, nothing really happens in all twelve episodes. Like other reviewers have said, this should have just bit the bullet and be turned into a hentai. The girls get less than one episode each of development, you very rarely get to see the star children themselves, the labyrinth-clearing is nonexistent, and the ritual to create the star children is glossed over and lasts about two minutes.<br />
<br />
If it had been turned into a hentai, at least that could have been mildly interesting, especially if each of the girls was given a different kink, but no dice.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t recommend this anime to anyone, not even if you&#039;re just looking for a way to kill time. That&#039;s about four hours of your lives you&#039;ll never get back, and you would probably be more entertained if you watched grass grow. At least then you would get the benefit of soaking up some good ol&#039; vitamin D. If you&#039;re really curious, you should just check out the game. Or, better yet, check out a different eroge game. There are guaranteed to be better ones than this.

    This is one of those worse anime that is very funny that you keep watching till the end.  I really don&#039;t know why I am typing this review.  I usually don&#039;t post a review. <br />
<br />
Story:  The story is basically stupid.  A male who has gone to another world and has to mate with 13 maidens to make children to save the world.  Even though it&#039;s not very ecchi, they should had made this one into a hentai.  It probably would have higher ratings with that story.<br />
<br />
Art: The art is not that amusing to me.  DB has better art

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295621">
        than this one, and it&#039;s an old anime<br />
<br />
Sound:  Sound is good.  One character stands out so much that she make the right speech.<br />
<br />
Character:  I think the characters are dumb.  The main character is just dumb.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment:  This is basically why I kept watching it.  The enjoyment of COMEDY.  I like comedy.  This one kept me laughing.  It is so bad yet funny.  <br />
<br />
So take a risk at it, if you dare.<br />
<br />
