    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)<br />
<br />
My older sister used to be a dancer, both as a hobby and as a job. And when I was younger, we would always have to go to her recitals. A recital is basically many different dancing performances consisting of a different combination of dancers.<br />
<br />
I hated going to them. The recital usually lasted four to five hours. They prohibited food and drink from entering the theater. I was not allowed to use electronics like my Game Boy. My sister was not even in all of the acts: out of the approximately thirty or so different

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213119">
        acts, she was in maybe three or four of them. I realize now that I was there to support my sister as her brother, but back then, I could not have cared any less for these boring, time-consuming dances.<br />
<br />
Venus Project: Climax is also filled with dancers and dances, although they use robots in conjunction with the idols. Even so, watching this anime was like watching one of those recitals, bringing with it the same boring and time-consuming feelings once more.<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
<br />
Venus Project is six episodes, which is about half the length of a regular anime season. As it turns out, that is six episodes too long.<br />
<br />
The plot of Venus Project is a simple one: Eriko, a rising star in the world of “Formula Venus” – the anime’s term for idols who dance and sing and fight with robots – enters the “Rookie Queen Tournament” to compete against other rising stars and to prove she is the best among them. Thus, each episode includes a dance battle that involves – coincidentally enough – dancing and battling. The problem is that the dance battles are only used for dancing and battling. They do not serve a greater purpose to the characters or the narrative or anything else that the show is doing. Each pairing of girls just shows up and dances for a bit. The before and the after might be affected by the dance battles, but the dance battles themselves do nothing for the narrative.<br />

With only six episodes, the anime cannot do much besides these dance battles, but the anime does try. Training montages, trips to Pooristan (Ruka’s self-titled, poverty-stricken country), and even an aside at the beach make up the downtime between the various battles. To be fair, these have more purpose than the dance battles themselves. The montage shows Eriko’s determination. The trip to Pooristan gives the audience the chance to understand just how excited everyone is to see Ruka competing. The beach aside (while mostly meant as fan-service) helps to take Eriko’s mind off of the troubles that were plaguing her. So surprisingly, the events that are not the focal point of the anime manage to have the most substance.<br />
<br />
And in a way, this is somewhat the point. The show is less about the lives of the idols and more about the lives of the people behind the glamor and the success. This is further reinforced by the ending. In a surprising twist, Venus Project actually does not go the obvious route of Eriko winning. Instead, Ruka wins the overtime duel. Eriko winning it all (while it would have been nice to see) does not matter. What matters is everything surrounding their dance battles: the friendly competition between the duelists, the support of their respective parties, and the prospect of future fights. There is more to life than just winning, and Venus Project proved that through the narrative it constructed.<br />
<br />
The show may have too much exposition, and the events themselves may have too much repetition, but again, for six episodes, the show does what it can to craft a narrative that is as purposeful and as well-constructed as it can be.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION<br />
<br />
Some of the worst parts of Venus Project are its art and its animation.<br />
<br />
Looking specifically at the art first, the anime does not have a wide variety of locales. The orphanage, the hospital, and the auditorium are the most visited areas, and even when the anime decides to go elsewhere, the attention to detail remains relatively low. This is most apparent with the dance-battles: the environment their robots fight in remains the same boring plain despite the song selection changing each time. All of this says nothing of the lighting and cinematography, both of which are practically nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the robots, each character has a robot that fights for them based on their dancing and their singing. Eriko has a giant, orange, humanoid robot. Ruka has a slender, purple, snake-like robot. And Miu has a small, dainty, nurse robot. These designs are not only bland in appearance – especially for giant robots – but also bland in their symbolism. Eriko’s is generic. Ruka’s snake-like abilities contradict her true persona. And Miu’s hardly fits her character. There might be a case for Horasu: her robot has big guns that coincide with her own “big guns.” Even so, some breast symbolism is not exactly worthwhile.<br />
<br />
The rest of the designs are likewise lackluster. As idols, the characters, similar to their robot counterparts, just do not have presence. Again, Eriko is orange. Ruka is purple. And Miu is pink. Colorful and accessorized, sure, but none of their designs are necessarily interesting. As was the case with Horasu, there might be a case for Romi Oze since her design seems a bit more involved than the others, but that is not saying a whole lot.<br />
<br />
But the actual animation is by far the worst part. These are supposed to be dancing idols, but they do not dance so much as they choppily flail around on stage. Their robot “fights” – which consist of little-to-no choreography and too many explosions – are no better. And everything in-between features the same sort of low-execution animation. There are some moments that have realistic hair shifting and some moments where the chest of the women bounce more so than usual, but these moments are a rare occurrence and do not represent the majority of the anime.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
For Venus Project, there are three main characters: Eriko, Ruka, and Miu.<br />
<br />
But they do not make up the entire cast. There are other side characters, like their coach, Tosano, who is there as a motivator for Eriko. Then there is Romi Oze, a newbie dancer, who demonstrates the harsher side to the idol world. And Asuka Kougami, the legendary Formula Venus competitor, who inspired Eriko and countless other women. Unfortunately, these characters are not the strongest. Tosano does have a character arc in the sense that he passes away due to his illness, but his actual character does not extend beyond a lot of shouting. Romi Oze is somehow forgotten about, so her aftermath is never revealed. And Asuka Kougami, while put on a pedestal, never actually interacts with Eriko and the other women she helped to inspire, turning her more into an idea as opposed to an actual character.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that the anime is without at least competent side characters. The orphanage that Eriko grew up in has a little girl that is initially extremely shy, even around Eriko. But after watching Eriko battle her heart out and seeing the wonders of Formula Venus, she gets inspired by Eriko to break out of her shell. In other words, this chain of inspiration provides a nice full-circle effect to Eriko’s character. There is also Ruka’s manager. She is blinded by passion for helping her and Ruka’s country as well as by Ruka’s recent success. Such blindness causes her to not see the turmoil Ruka was going through until it was too late. From then on, she always kept Ruka’s well-being in mind, leveraging Ruka’s scarce performances to her and Ruka’s advantage. Again, these characters are by no means strong or even above average, but they at least demonstrate that Venus Project put some semblance of thought into its characters.<br />
<br />
The same can be said for its mains – namely, Eriko, Ruka, and Miu. Eriko is the main character and arguably the best of the lot. When she was little, she was without family and without any hope. But as was said, when she first watched Asuka Kougami take the stage, she knew what she wanted to become. So she practiced. She trained. She battled for her spot in Formula Venus. This was all done in flashback, but her character progressed from a down-and-out child to a promising young woman. In the present, where Eriko is competing in the Rookie Queen Tournament, she goes through a lot of emotions: elation at winning her first battle, sadness at defeating her best friend, and acceptance at losing to her rival. In the end, Eriko does not win the battle but she does win the war: she has finally made a name for herself in the world of Formula Venus, fulfilling the dream her kid-self had those many years ago.<br />
<br />
Contrary to Eriko, Ruka is arguably the weakest of the main characters. Ruka’s past is not divulged to the same extent that Eriko’s is, but given where she comes from (Pooristan, which has to be an in-joke of some kind) her looking nowhere else but forward is understandable. Ruka is known as the front-runner in winning and the one to beat in the Rookie Queen Tournament due to her magical voice. But what most people do not know is her secret: an incredibly fragile throat. Her voice is both a blessing and a curse, a curse that sees her lose to Eriko before the main tournament. Yet Ruka never complains and never lets the defeat get to her. In fact, it is presumed that she wants revenge against Eriko. In actuality, all she wanted was to sing her songs against Eriko as a rival and, more importantly, as a friend. Ruka wins for her country, inspiring millions and saving them from a life of hardship, which in turn earned her some much-needed rest. Ruka’s biggest problem, however, is that she not only has no personality but also has no development as a character. So while she is characterized well-enough, the other parts to her character are sorely missing.<br />
<br />
As for Miu, her character rests somewhere in-between Eriko and Ruka. From a young age, her path in life was set: to take over mother’s position as head of the family company. That is, Miu was forced to take her mother’s dream. Miu, understandably upset, pushes back, choosing instead to become an idol. When she meets Eriko for the first time, however, she realizes that even this path might not really be the one for her. So when Miu loses to Eriko and follows through on the promise she made to her mother by quitting Formula Venus, Miu reviews herself. Her last few scenes showcase her cutting her hair – a common symbol for change – to demonstrate that the right dream for her is still out there. Maybe it will be at the family company, maybe it will be as an idol, or maybe it will be something else entirely. Regardless of what the dream actually is, Miu’s newfound determination to find this dream will prove that when shedoes find it, that dream will finally be the right one for her.<br />
<br />
Looking at Eriko, Ruka, and Miu collectively, they are not awful characters for a six-episode anime series. They are also not amazing. However, they do manage to have something in common: the main characters each have a reason for fighting. They each have a purpose for dancing and battling and performing. For Eriko, she wanted to prove that the support from her family and friends was not for naught. For Ruka, she wanted to bring hope to her country where none was found. And for Miu, she wanted to run away from her mother’s dream to pursue one that was right for herself.<br />
<br />
This is an interesting message because it is such a true one. Not everyone is out to make a name for themselves and are instead motivated by other factors. Yet people do not normally think about what someone else might be going through or what someone else might be dealing with. So Venus Project taking the time to show this in its main characters – how everyone involved has their own reasons for wanting to win – was a surprisingly human theme that added some depth to the characters where there previously was not any.<br />
<br />
SOUND<br />
<br />
In any other genre of anime, Venus Project’s music would be subpar. But given that this anime is one all about music and idols and singing, the music is not subpar but awful.<br />
<br />
Starting with the OP, the OP begins and ends in a cool manner due to the hard guitar. But once the remainder of the track starts to play, the smorgasbord of instruments and the low range of the vocalists turns the OP into a mess of a song. The ending theme fairs slightly better because the beat and lyrics are slightly catchier, but the vocalist still does not bring enough emotion into the piece, and the final few seconds feel way too out-of-place. Not to mention that both the OP and the ED are a bit too peppy for this arguably dramatic tale.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Venus Project’s most egregious mistake is the lackluster original soundtrack. While the songs the vocalists sing are varied, the songs have no lasting qualities and are ultimately uninteresting to listen to. And this is not even counting the rest of the other songs in the OST. Boring piano pieces, lyric-infused montage ones, and a flute tune that can only be described as having been taken from a JRPG. But the worst track is technically not even a track at all. The transition track between the “A” and “B” parts of the episodes is so goofy and inappropriate that it singlehandedly ruins the episodes. And to top it all off, it is often played twice, back-to-back.<br />
<br />
Even the voice acting fails to reach a level that plays to the strengths of this type of show. Sawako Hata as Eriko uses a voice that is a bit too husky. Riho Iida as Ruka does not nail the “Da’s” of the seemingly Russian girl. And Marika Hayase as Miu tries to mix a cute and mature voice that fits the cute and mature character, but her voice does not have any oomph to it. This extends to their singing during the Formula Venus battles: nobody gives a performance that is even remotely memorable.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT<br />
<br />
Before watching this one, I actually watched an episode of the television series that accompanied the show. Meaning, I knew from the beginning that this anime was more or less an advertisement for the franchise it touts. But I have to give the anime some credit because it never felt like an advertisement. Yes, they sing songs that are most likely from the game (I have no idea since I do not play it). And yes, they have cameos of characters from other parts of the franchise (based on what I learned from that one television episode).<br />
<br />
Sadly, this does not save this one from being an absolute chore to watch. I think the only scene where I legitimately liked what the anime did was when Kenta, Eriko’s biggest supporter from the orphanage, was revealed to be visiting the shrine every day because he was praying for her to win. That was a cute and clever moment. One cute and clever moment. Out of six episodes, if only a single scene did anything for me, that cannot be called entertaining.<br />
<br />
Venus Project: Climax is a sorry excuse for an anime. Its abhorrent art and animation, its horrendous music, and its low amount of entertainment make it nearly unwatchable. Its story and its characters barely (just barely) save this one from bottom-of-the-barrel status. On second thought, those recitals do not sound half as boring anymore.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Story: Fine, the battles are worthless, and the exposition and repetition might be problematic, but the focus on what truly matters is not-so-worthless<br />
<br />
Animation: Terrible, bad art direction, lame robot designs, lame character designs, below average actual animation<br />
<br />
Characters: Fine, side characters like Romi Oze and Tosano could have been handled better, but some of the sides are fine, and Eriko, Ruka, and Miu are competent characters whose theme on personal reasons has a surprising amount of value<br />
<br />
Sound: Terrible, poor OP, bad ED, poor OST, below average VA performances<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Terrible, very boring from beginning to end, except for one particular scene<br />
<br />
Final Score: 2/10

     Before I write my review on Venus Project Climax, please note if you disagree with anything I type out and want to have a friendly debate about the review and/or different opinions, feel free to leave a comment on my profile and I will respond as soon as possible. I find it a shame you cannot find my review not helpful if you found it unhelpful, but blame the folks who decided to abuse the system. Anyway, this is my review of Venus Project Climax!<br />
<br />
 VPC was an anime full of cliches seen in anime for at least twenty years such as ecchi and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review200300">
        the main character is an unstoppable force that is greater than anyone else who tries to rival him/her! VPC was also an anime that had some pacing issues due to only having six episodes worth of material and also suffered from a somewhat bland set of characters. Well, I strongly believe Ruka is miles ahead than the complete VPC roster, though we&#039;ll leave that to opinion. Yes people, VPC is flawed! Heck, it may be more flawed than a majority of the anime this season alone. Though, what of it? Do flaws automatically mean you will trash a show and say it is indeed shit? Shall I be a sheep and hate on VPC due to its obviously bad for mal standards rating? I know! Want me to justify loving this anime and call it a guilty pleasure!? Well, I just will not do that. I loved VPC. Actually, allow me to take it just one step further. VPC is officially in my top twenty-five and my AOTS. I have already admitted that VPC is flawed and understandable if those flaws have caused you to really dislike the anime, but allow me to come out and say that the anime also had numerous positives and they heavily out-weighed the negatives, some of them being spoilers so I will refrain from listing them all.<br />
<br />
 VPC had a very unique tackle on the Idol genre (..even if it really is not a genre) and had my glued to my screen the entire time. I even believe this could of been a very memorable anime for fans of the medium if it had stronger world building and more episodes. With that said, the story itself is likely a hit or miss for most as a lot of people will find the flaws distracting from the anime itself, but I am sure there is at least one other fan on mal who really enjoyed what VPC offered in every department. The art and sound were fine, nothing special and nothing worth going depth in. Hey, I am NOT being lazy. Just, is there a point to discuss something that has no placed to be discussed? The art is fine as I said and the music is not really great, but is in no way distracting.<br />
<br />
 The characters..... ah yes the bland characters with bigger bust than personality! Though, let me make one thing clear. Ruka is a character I admire more than anyone in all of anime and she is by the best VPC offers in the character department. Ruka has a mysterious vibe to her, but as the anime drifts on and exposes more plot besides the boobs, you learn to accept her. Well, I admired her. Though, as I stated before I will refrain from posting spoilers so you all can enjoy the anime yourself. By the way, I just claimed Ruka as my new waifu! Haha yes, before anyone else! Stat wise, I am the only user on mal who has her as my top character in all of anime! Please note that nobody will ever own Ruka except me no matter what you try! I am her biggest fan and added her as my top favorite first, after all. Wow, I am deeply pathetic, but anyway besides Ruka, the cast is pretty bland.<br />
<br />
 My enjoyment for VPC was pretty high. Not as high as masterpieces such as Aria or Cowboy Bebop, but really high anyway. With all that said, most of my review focused on the negatives. Though, the positives and what this anime meant to me made it a masterpiece for me. How can such a flawed anime be a masterpiece you say!? Well, it just is #deal. Check it out if you want. You may not enjoy it as much as I did, but it is worth trying.

    Welcome to my review of Venus Project: Climax! Now that the 6 episodes have come out, this version of my review will be the final one.<br />
<br />
(Story - 5/10)<br />
The story itself feels rushed. Considering the number of episodes, that should be a given. But, that&#039;s where the strength of the story lies as well. Precisely because of the short episode count, each of the main character&#039;s development progress was quickly done and over with, which brings the Anime itself straight into the climax, which is the Formula Venus singing and dancing competition. That&#039;s where the strong part of the Anime lies; because of the interesting concept

          <span style="display: none;" id="review198943">
        that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer&#039;s soul when they are singing, us audience will want to be able to watch more of those. Jumping straight into the climax only helps fuel that. The other good part of the story would be that each of the competitors in Formula Venus has their own dream, although that part wasn&#039;t properly played out due to the low episode count once again, but that doesn&#039;t pose much of a factor.<br />
<br />
This part comes in at the final episode of Venus Project: Climax where the final song of the competition happens to be  itself. I like this because it brings a proper closure which many Anime lacks and if you have watched it, it shows how Ruka and Eriko sing their hearts out not because they want to win, but simply because they just want to sing alongside each other. Winning at that point isn&#039;t important anymore.<br />
<br />
(Art - 6/10)<br />
The art style of this Anime is pretty fitting. The choice of colors are colorful and vibrant, which is a great fit for any Anime involving singing and dancing, as they portrait each character&#039;s joyfulness and cheerful self. The way the characters are designed are pretty well done as well. When looking at them, you couldn&#039;t possibly say that one is a rip-off of another,because they aren&#039;t! Each character has their own unique design.<br />
<br />
(Sound - 7/10)<br />
Short as it may be, being an Anime about singing and dancing, this should come as no surprise. Songs are great, and the uniqueness of the way they are presented was really what caught my eye. As mentioned in the story section,  the interesting concept that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer&#039;s soul when they are singing has also helped to represent the songs in a different light. Because the characters put their heart and soul into singing and dancing coupled with the action in the virtual battle, the charm and attractiveness of the songs which makes the audience listen to them were brought out.<br />
<br />
(Character - 4/10)<br />
To be completely honest, the Anime itself does not have much character development. Yes, while we have seen the characters progress how they came to know about Formula Venus to participating in it, there isn&#039;t much else to see other than the competition itself. That being said, the plus points are when the types of each competitor are shown when they have either won or lost a match, that is the sportsmanship and the friendship between some of them. <br />
<br />
This part was also added because of the final episode of the Anime. Considering the number of main character listed and how late into the show Ruka appeared, I was worried that she wouldn&#039;t have enough screen time to develop as one of the main characters. That changed because of how much she has done for her country and it also shows how much she loves singing.<br />
<br />
(Enjoyment - 7/10)<br />
Given that it is a 6 episode series, the main point would come down to whether the Anime can rein my interest in for that long. In the end, I would have to say that it did. For that, the enjoyment part deserves a high score. For those who are new to the series or have not watched it till this point, the way to keep your interest in it is to put your attention and focus on the competition itself. That way, you&#039;ll be looking forward to the next match once the previous one ends and you&#039;ll never get bored of it until the end of the Anime.<br />
<br />
(Overall - 7/10)<br />
On overall, I&#039;m giving this Anime a 7 out of 10 score for how much I enjoyed it. It is a good watch if you&#039;re someone who enjoys listening to songs while watching action go on at the same time. While it is centered around singing, it is not too much too the point where the singing itself becomes mundane. Do give it a go and tell me what you think about it!

    The best word that can describe this anime is average or mediocre, but is not bad, let me explain.<br />
<br />
This is a very good concept, but that&#039;s it, the series is all a just a bunch of good concepts that never try to acomplish anything.<br />
<br />
The idea of idols who can make robots fight when they sing to decide who&#039;s best is really good, the character desing is actually very good even with those outfits, and the music is enjoyable, but they never try anything with it, the series spends too much time with filler that is not important and then it trows a bunch of lore

          <span style="display: none;" id="review356868">
        in your face expecting you to get attached to the girl in that episode, but it doesn&#039;t work like that, and is quite funny most of them have tragic backstories so you can at least feel bad for them.<br />
<br />
i see a lot of potential here, but it wasn&#039;t used properly and just 6 episodes make this look like a bunch of ovas more than a series (and for a while i thought that&#039;s what it was but no, the game with the same name doesn&#039;t even have a story and i read something about a card game? but obviously that doesn&#039;t have a story either) , you can enjoy it perfectly fine, but to me it was a waste of potential and good ideas, the animation was quite good sometimes i have to say, i wasn&#039;t expecting much about art and animation but it surprised me.<br />
<br />
I guess is good to pass time
