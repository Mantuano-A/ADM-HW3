    Remember that time when Darling in the Franxx and Seikon no Qwaser almost had a bastard baby, but decided to have an abortion when it was clearly too late? Somehow the embryo survived and got raised by Fate/Apocrypha. Then, at the age of 9, it discovered that its upbringer and role model is not the only thing that exists in the world, and learned about Tokyo Ghoul, JoJo and FMA. That baby is Ulysses.<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, I may be a bit too harsh on the show in this review, but it reflects my personal opinion and what I saw in the show. Some spoilers ahead, not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297479">
        that you should really care.<br />
<br />
Plot: what plot? The plot, as the premise makes you think, is on a level of some pseudo-historical smut fanfiction written by a 12 year old edgelord, except I&#039;ve seen better pseudo-historical smut fanfiction than this. The main idea is that Jeanne D&#039;arc can go Super Saiyan after receiving a kiss from the MC (who is Gilles de Rais, just saying). Those kisses are called &quot;baisers&quot; in the show, which is unneeded and cringeworthy use of French and could make my score lower by a point itself, if only it had somewhere lower to go. Then, apparently, it&#039;s supposed to follow Hundred Years&#039; War, which it doesn&#039;t really do, only showing fragments of real history in the beginning of the first half of the show. In reality, the show is about people who want to have philosopher&#039;s stone, which is split between MC and Jeanne. At some point the show literally pulls a Franxx on us, with random aliens on spaceships trying to destroy the Earth and everything, though I wonder which came first because apparently the original novel is a few years old. Overall, the story is an incomprehensible mess and doesn&#039;t know what it wants to be at any point of the show, which results in it being either mindbogglingly boring or unbelievably dumb, and I honestly don&#039;t know which is worse. There&#039;s no ending, either, so it ends up being a LN promotion, though I can&#039;t see anyone saying &quot;Yes, I&#039;m going to read this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Characters: okay, let me say this straight: this is a show where plot drives the characters, not vice versa. While I don&#039;t think there&#039;s something inherently wrong with it, this anime definitely doesn&#039;t understand what to do with those characters. This ends up in them being randomly in and out in the plot, being pushed on the sides and forgotten as quickly as they made their appearance. Most are based on some historical personalities, but almost none of their original documented traits remain, and in some cases, not even their original gender. Sadly, that&#039;s all there is to them, because the show doesn&#039;t even try to do any characterization, and any kind of development that may happen fails miserably because there&#039;s no character to develop, just a carton cutout. Also, it has an Astolfo from Fate/Apocrypha. I mean, he looks, dresses and behaves like him, but he isn&#039;t Astolfo. Amazing, isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
Art: is horrendous. While the first episodes were decently animated, the quality rapidly declined in the second half, to the point where anime almost fully consisted of panning stills and ugly CGI soldiers in the end. The worst part that stills weren&#039;t even drawn properly. Montmorency&#039;s character design gave me cancer. Cute lolis were the only thing that kept me going, guess what, one got in-universe sudden boobs and ass expansion. Apparently that&#039;s a thing.<br />
<br />
Sound: voice acting was average, the opening song was fine, the ending song (well, 10 of them, it has a new version in almost every episode) was good, and the background music wasn&#039;t really noticeable. I can&#039;t really say much about it, but it&#039;s definitely the strongest part about the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: trainwreck but it was fun to make fun of it on Discord. It&#039;s not the good kind of fun, though, as you feel your brain is slowly dying. Some scenes were rage-inducing, for example, MC saying &quot;I want to save the girl I love so go fight for me&quot; and army of peasants going berserk easily slaughtering professional full armored soldiers after that. Thoroughly unenjoyable even ironically.<br />
<br />
Overall: no/10, almost the worst TV anime with normal length episodes I&#039;ve ever seen (Lord of Vermilion from last season still exists). Go watch literally anything else and it probably would be better. Or try this - I don&#039;t even want to call it a trainwreck because there was no train to begin with - and maybe you&#039;ll like it, although I certainly didn&#039;t.

    France 1415. English people are still being total buttholes, but at least everyone speaks Japanese so that&#039;s kinda cool.<br />
<br />
Historical series are often problematic because they are too inaccurate to do any glory for historical events and the real events are too boring to be create good entertainment without major beautification. Jeanne d&#039;Arc&#039;s story is popular subject and inspiration among those who write these type of series -- which I personally refer to as historical fanfiction -- and Ulysses is a prime example of a series that would be the exact same shit as it is, be it based to Jeanne d&#039;Arc or not.<br />
<br />
Many do not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review292838">
        know this, but fairies and alchemy were the thing France was most known of before cheese and wine became a thing. Not really, but they play a big part in this series where all nobles / any other characters are under-aged kids, and English soldiers so talentless they can&#039;t even slay a weaponless lolies. Most of this series focuses around bunch of kids staying alive for no reason and talking about succeeding in politics or subjects that were very much a thing in the 15th century, such as duels, family-shaming, satanism and senpais. Everything the series accomplishes or claims to accomplish is the outcome of our main characters remaining the bestest of friends with each others because friendship is totally the thing that is going to end wars. Also anikis, imoutos and all sorts of brotherly relations seems to be valued here - much like in the history of every thrones game. <br />
<br />
There is probably a way to enjoy this thing if it&#039;s not being taken very seriously. I personally couldn&#039;t find this from the characters because the mc&#039;s are annoying brats, the only grill who looked cool turned out to be some type of early misandrist feminist according to whom all men are horny pigs -- she is like 14 in the beginning, not sure with what her daddy used to beat her but whatever. The aniki dudes felt like team rocket from pokimon except done seriously. I guess the story could be laughed at since it&#039;s so stupid, but it also too dull and not so overboard idiotic that it could offer entertainment with ironic viewing. The nobbles clothing are kinda sexy, but the art otherwise is not really standing out in anyway so yah, there ain&#039;t many reasons to like this one and personally, I am not. Tho I did quite enjoy that scene where the mc blamed women for him still being a virgin after timeskips, and the boobie fanservice moments -- just like in the longest Anglo-French war that lasted over 100 years. Thanks Japan for adding the missing details on that one.

    History has a famous name and it’s Joan of Arc. As a heroine of France, she’s a peasant girl that became a commander with a level of charisma that few could match during her era. She&#039;s a village girl that became a legendary figure. But Ulysses is far from a legend. It’s a show that deserved to be burned by fire.<br />
<br />
That may be a harsh thing to say and it pains me to actually mention it. But as someone who enjoyed the author’s previous work (The Ambition of Oda Nobuna), this was nothing short than a damnation. You’ll probably want to know the who, what,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297471">
        how, and why. And make no mistake, prepare for disappointment.<br />
<br />
For starters, you should discard any historical facts about the show altogether. This is more of a mixture of fantasy, history, action, and drama thrown together. While many people may have heard of Jeanne, few probably know of the name, “Montmorency”. As the main male protagonist, I question his motives as an alchemist. In the beginning, he tries to discover the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone. The man has potential to create a world without pain and suffering after what he’s been through. The actual result ends up with him summoning a Fairy Queen. Her name is Astaroth and she promises to teach Montmorency on how to become a Ulysses. What is a Ulysses? In their world, it’s a supreme being with unimaginable powers. To be honest, having a set up like this already sets off a lot of red flags.<br />
<br />
As for the story’s plot, we don’t meet Jeanne until after going through a background story about Montmorency and his childhood friends. The most prominent is Arthur de Richemont, who happens to be his secret love. The first episode spells doom for these kids when Richemont is seemingly killed while Montmorency experiences the reality of war. While I dare say the author made a memorable impression of the tragedy event, it didn’t make me care much about the main characters altogether. There wasn’t much chemistry between the protagonists and Montmorency hasn’t been established as a character. Why should I also care about Richemont besides her name and social status? However, I don’t want to sound too off base since that’s the early portions of the show. In the preceding episodes, we finally get to know Jeanne d’Arc, the titular main character. And oh boy, that red flag sailed high in the air.<br />
<br />
I know this show is far from historical accurate but Jeanne’s debut is also just dreadful. It’s far from paying a homage to the historical figure when she has blonde hair and also a childish personality. As a 12 year old, it’s hard to care about her beyond what she brings into the show. It doesn’t also help that the majority of the cast are also much younger than their historical counterparts. But when she becomes a Ulysses, her child persona disappears and becomes a completely different being. It’s like an inner demon awakens inside of her and makes Jeanne into a killer. Only in this show, they seem to portray her Ulysses persona to be some sort of heroine. The way I see it, Jeanne feels like a weapon of war rather than a person. While she does have a personality, her character lacks morality when “saving” people by resorting to killing. She sees Montmorency as someone to trust in after they establish a bond with each other. But to me, there’s little more character bond than an alchemist and his partner. Sadly, the show’s character relationships are poorly written with little creative thought. The childhood friendships between Montmorency, Richemont, Charlotte, and Philip gives off a pseudo-harem stench that hardly develops anywhere. Then, there’s Astaroth (who isn’t even human) so her lack of common logic at times is thrown out the window. Weak character bonds and chemistry made the cast look like poor actors on a stage. If we talk about other characters with status, there’s guys like La Tremoille. As a sadistic human being, it doesn’t take long for the man to reveal his true colors and his intentions against Jeanne. And by this point, I knew pretty much every antagonist in this show is more like disposable waste. <br />
<br />
Luckly, there’s something in it for fans who are interested in seeing a well-polished war story, right? After all, the show does take place during the 15th century when France and England were engaged in warfare. Unfortunately, I’ll have to be the bearer of bad news. Challenging myself to watch this series with a focused mind was tough when it’s just bloodbath slaughter on the battlefield. In later episodes, I find less and less devoted to see who would take the French throne. Even some of the more noticeable characters like La Hire feels out of place. Seriously, who wears that sort of shaggy outfit with twin barrel guns? I think the author went over their head to make the characters look fashionable but it came out as nearly unbelievable. Oh and be prepared for a host load of fan service in the form of kissing. It’s not just a soft gentle kiss either as many scenes show French kissing with tongue and saliva. Don’t mistake that as romance though as it’s more of a process necessary for the plot device of the show. Studio AXsiz has a mixed reception of their projects and to be honest, this anime can join that list too.<br />
<br />
I get it now. I think what the show wanted me to experience is some sort of war story with emotions and character struggles. What I got instead is a show with poorly adapted historical figures that almost feels like an insult to the real Joan of Arc. I’d advice from committing to this show unless you’re absolutely curious about Mikage Kasuga’s work. Avoid this like the plague and don&#039;t look back.

    I&#039;m French so it might be my national pride or something but this anime felt like an insult to Jeanne d&#039;Arc, I really like this period of history and I know the story of Gille de Rais (Montmorency) and Jeanne so almost all caracter don&#039;t have the personnality of their historic figures wich is not really important if you can do a better caracter but they did not. Orginaly the king (Charlotte) his a coward, Jeanne is a little girl who became a general and lead army, killed people, and had the charisma so incredible she is still consider one of the most incredible caracter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301324">
        of our history and Montmorency was crazy about Jeanne so fucking crazy he killed babies. I&#039;m normaly not harsh on anime but this one is just.....<br />
<br />
So what did the show gave us?<br />
<br />
The story : Kind of messy maybe they tried to put a lot in 12 épisodes but could not so the story didn&#039;t make sense if you don&#039;t know history or geography of France. <br />
The magic aspect was really bad, the magic stones were not really exploited; they were just magic weapon but 3 min of an angry girl beating up soldier from time to time not worth it espacially in the end the god felt like a pile of shit falling from the sky on an anime that could have been at least decent.<br />
<br />
Charaters: Just basic nothing really amazing; jeanne is disapointing, Montmorency is like any other anime character that want to save the world and the other are just like any other female character that like the hero because he is a nice guy who want to save people. The main enemy doesn&#039;t exist well they are like 2 or 3 depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Quality: The quality of the animation and music overall is decent.<br />
<br />
General opinion: They could have done a incredible anime but they wanted to change it to make it more like any other fantasy anime and they fucked up so bad.<br />
<br />
If their is a lesson for that show; it&#039;s don&#039;t try to change something big and incredible into a normal thing because you will most likely fucked up. <br />

    I am loving this show. The concept of a Alchemist that creates a Ulysses. Many of the element drawn up in this show has gotten me up on my feet from the fights to the other creature that has been revealed. Also how much time it can take studying. Considering how much time it took him to learn is actually connecting to the real world. Showing you how fast it really takes when you are in school to college then your out on your own. For us it was the blink of an eye. I&#039;m going to continue to watch since the story can still

          <span style="display: none;" id="review293425">
        be developed in so many ways. I&#039;m glad to continue watching as it comes out.<br />
<br />
Read some of the down votes they find things wrong but aren&#039;t looking for the good parts of the story. Sure some parts may be questionable but understand it comes with the story.

    History is always something that we tend to look back to in order to improve from the mistakes we have made in society and also act as a precortional tale. of course, history also spawns stories that can be seen influencing media today. Often times, media likes to bring these classic tales to the modern day to have a new way of telling the story. Sometimes they put their own spin on it to differentiate itself or to spice things things up. That last sentence is where we find ourselves today. A retelling of the story of one of the most empowering females in history

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297470">
        with a twist of it being in a magical setting. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sit back, relax and make sure that you drink some of that sweet, sweet elixir as I present to you the anime review for Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc and the Alchemist Knight. Lets Begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 2.5/10<br />
<br />
Set during the 100 years war between France and England, the story follows an aspiring alchemist by the name of Montmorency who wants to protect his closest friends by becoming the next Ulysses, a protector of humanity. With the help of the fairy queen, Astaroth, and being the owner of the powerful Philosophers stone, he finds out that he cannot do it for he cannot contain the power of the stone. However, after encountering a young farmgirl by the name of Jeanne who is able to able to contain the Philosophers stone, they decide to become a beacon of hope for all of France to drive back England to their country and become the heroes the country needs. <br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t obvious already, the story is based off the story of Joan of Arc, a woman who was blessed by God to drive back England from their land. Only this time, its not religion that grants her powers, its magic. It was intriguing for me at least to begin with since magic is more interesting I would say than being blessed by God because you can make some interesting storylines with that. Well it would be if the story managed to keep sight of what the story is supposed to be based on. Even though the magic element makes for some good explanations, it doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is a loose adaptation of the Joan of Arc story. Throughout the series, the story goes off track as it likes to take detours to explore other plot threads. If you are going to do that, you&#039;ve got to make them interesting. Ulysses does not do that. The story&#039;s characterisation is piss poor. They don&#039;t do well at distincting the characters from one another and establishing them in the story. Instead, they just fall into cliched character tropes that just don&#039;t help make the story more interesting. <br />
<br />
It makes the story overall feel uninspired. It doesn&#039;t do well to captivate its audience as it just lacks that unique factor despite its setting. It doesn&#039;t help the fact that the story just goes off the rails near the end and feels like a completely different story overall than what it was supposed to be. The fact that the entire story continuously forgets that this is a fantasy retelling is bad when you think about it. It is like the show just loses interest and wants to do something different. That&#039;s just bad storytelling. If you are going on a set path, stick with it. There is also explanation dumps at the start of almost every episode to tell the story that is going on in the background. Telling your story and not showing doesn&#039;t exactly make your story engaging now does it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 1/10<br />
<br />
The characters in this show are just plain awful, cliched and boring. <br />
<br />
lets start with out main protagonist Montmorency. Montomorency is yet another standard, generic protagonist. His motivations are clearly just to protect his best friends and Jeanne which isn&#039;t exactly an original motivation and his personality isn&#039;t endearing either. He is more or less annoying and a bit dense as, like every other generic protagonist, he doesn&#039;t always consider other people&#039;s feelings and apologises for it. He doesn&#039;t do much either as his only relevance to the plot is at the beginning and near the end of the story. That&#039;s bad for the character that&#039;s supposed to be the main protagonist. <br />
<br />
And it only gets worse. All of the female characters in this show are best described as &quot;Montomorency harem.&quot; The majority have little to no personality whatsoever and basically just feel lost without Montomorency. They basically can&#039;t do much without requiring their mmaaaaann to come and save them. It kind of ruins their individuality. Richemont especially feels like this. What I thought was going to be a strong female character turned into one of the parts of the overall harem and what the show likes to focus on when it comes to fan service with some groping and sexual harassment. Yeah, like that&#039;s going to build a character. And the fact that she feels lost without Montomorency at her side feels so cliched (again, the harem). <br />
<br />
But what I find the worst part of the characters is the show&#039;s treatment of Jeanne. Jeanne (or Joan of Arc) is regarded as one of the most empowering woman in history. Her motivation and ability to unite France under one banner to drive back England was inspiring and captivating to make her an icon in France&#039;s history books. So what does the show do? Make her a thirsty loli who has an obsession of having big breasts. That&#039;s just insulting. And also, she feels like a secondary character despite she should be the main focus of this show and, guess what? Feels lost without Montomorency. The show goes through Montomrency first and he is just so boring, uninspired and unlikable. So that just makes all other characters just as bad, if not worse than Montomrency. <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 3/10<br />
<br />
Crap is the simplest way to describe it. While the art style is arguably alright, the animation itself is just bad. Cutaways, intense, shaky cinematography instead of animating it and some really crappy looking CGI. It makes the fight scenes really lacklustre. There are times though where the animation looks good, but they are few and far between when the show is dominated with cheap ways to animate a fight scene. The character designs are somewhat relevant to the time period, but some of the designs lean more to the fanservice side with large, bouncy breasts pretty much everywhere (No wonder Jeanne wants a pair) and showing more skin than, well, armour. Again, it just feels like the characters are just there to act as nothing more than part of the harem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 6/10<br />
<br />
The music for Ulysess is alright. Nothing spectacular yet not bad at the same time. It certainly sounds kind of like the style of music that would be playing at that time with a sense of French royalty to it. It can add a mood but really, it is played down a little too much and is forgettable or even noticeable at times. It fails to stand out and add to a scene. The same goes with the opening as well. It is a pretty standard opening with showing the characters and visually foreshadowing of events to come. The song &quot;Liberation&quot; by Mai Fuchigami didn&#039;t really make want to &quot;jam out&quot; to this opening because it just meh. That is it, it doesn&#039;t do anything good, neither does it do anything bad. It just exists. <br />
<br />
The ending sequence though. Now that&#039;s beautiful. It&#039;s brilliant artwork correlating to the episode is just so good to look at. The calming song as well adds to it as it just makes it that more beautiful. It almost makes it worth to watch through an episode. Almost. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
<br />
There are some anime that I watch because I enjoy them. There are some anime that I watch because I am going along with the ride. Then there are some anime that I watch because when I get to review them, I get to bash the s**t at them. Ulysses is very much the latter. A story that has no idea what it want it wants to do with itself. Uninspiring and uninteresting characters. Crap animation and and meh ost. This show really doesn&#039;t have anything going for it. It doesn&#039;t do anything well and just does everything else either meh or poorly. I had some hype going into this series and it really didn&#039;t do anything to amaze me to match up to that hype. What could have been an interesting, fantasy retelling of the story of one of the most iconic woman in history turned into a mess that I don&#039;t recommend anyone to watch. Not even to the curious. Your time is best spent elsewhere with this one. <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 1/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 2.7/10  Recommendation: Don&#039;t f***ing bother

    There really is not any character development and the English Army enemies are seen as generic. Literally no real enemies for the main characters. A good show has plot with both sides of the conflict whereas this show simply glorifies the French side and has no development for the English. Montmorency is basically useless throughout the show and has very little action. The whole swallowing of the stone creating Jean of Arc is very cliche and the show has literally 0 plot twists. It is truly appalling that such a show even exists as it is very similar to a harem but with none of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295498">
        the action making any sense. Basically, some random girl becomes super OP for no reason and blows away all opponents with no problem. Then you have side-lackey Montmorency just tailing around doing some useful alchemy once every 3 episodes.

    Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc to Renkin no Kishi is based off a light novel series that is basically a fanfiction — shipping Jeanne d’Arc and *Gilles de Rais together. An alternate retelling of the Hundred Years’ War with many busty, bishōjo characters. While that may sound wretched to some, the designs were very visually appealing — but the farthest from ‘historically accurate’ as you could possible imagine. The author of ‘Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc and the Alchemist Knight’ also published another HISTORICALLY ACCURATE tome called ‘Oda Nobuna no Yabō,’ which revolves around an average high school student finding himself in an isekai situation, during the Sengokū era.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review321784">
        Naturally, Oda Nobunaga is a tsundere loli in the light novel.<br />
*The anime refers to him by his surname, Montmorency.<br />
<br />
This review contains spoilers! You have been warned!<br />
<br />
The characters aren’t the focus of the story, as much as the magical incorporation in the plot. Though there are a few character moments that I thought were endearing, such as (when asked to find where she hid Excalibur), Astaroth pretty much says, ‘How am I supposed to know? That was thousands of years ago!’ *Arthur de Richmond was pretty likable as well, but didn’t get enough screentime. The characters with the largest amount of focus were Montmorency, Jeanne d’Arc, *Philippe of Burgundy, and Astaroth. <br />
*Changed from men to pretty women, of course!<br />
<br />
This series doesn’t try to hide that it’s an ecchi. It’s mobile game formula of having the majority of the cast be curvy women is evidence of this. The episodic previews even talk about breasts or have lessons on how to say lewd things in French, including one of the most repeated words in the series: baiser (kiss). As a long-time otaku, I’m used to seeing bikini armor and cleavage everywhere, so it doesn’t bother me at all. <br />
<br />
The animation is probably the weakest part of the series, the direction got really weird, too, because there is no fluidity between the frames and the animation clips or ‘slides’ around a lot. It is incredibly jarring. It’s no wonder though, the director of Berserk (2016)—Shin Itagaki, was the director of this series as well. And that series is infamous for scenes where Guts ‘slides’ across the screen. Because of the poor animation, *a dramatic scene where fairies are getting slaughtered is, instead, laughable. <br />
*Episode 2: The Girl Called Jeanne (ジャンヌという少女)<br />
<br />
The OST was really good. During the fight scenes, there would be high-intensity violin music (reminiscent of Lindsey Stirling) that would instantly amplify the hype for certain battles. The composer behind this great OST is none other than Taku Iwasaki, the genius behind the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei. The ED song, performed by a Japanese musician that goes by the name ‘riono,’ was somber and contemplative; usually used to accent a cliffhanger at the end of particularly dramatic episodes. The paintings in the ED looked similar to Yoshitaka Amano’s art from the earlier Final Fantasy games, and gives the ED an ambience of otherworldly appeal.<br />
* Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei (The Irregular at Magic High School) had a bumping soundtrack that intensified the absurdity of Tatsuya Shiba’s character.<br />
<br />
A Condensed Version of the Plot and A Comparison to the Real Historical Narrative:<br />
<br />
Plot: Montmorency performs a ritual, by selling his soul to *Astaroth, so that he can learn how to extract elixir from the Philosopher’s Stone. Astaroth tells him that he must swallow the stone to become a *Ulysses. The process does not go as plan and Montmorency is transported seven years into the future. After this point, Montmorency becomes infatuated with a twelve-year-old girl he meets (Jeanne d&#039;Arc). She is mortally wounded by an English infantry after witnessing her fairy friends get brutally murdered. Montmorency saves her life by inserting half of the Philosopher’s Stone into her body, and then uses the other half to produce an elixir (via ‘exchanging saliva with her’).  <br />
*In this interpretation of her character, Astaroth is a fairy — instead of a demon — but this doesn’t break the continuity of the story because Montmorency mentions that demons and fairies are the same. *A Ulysses in this story is pretty much like a spiritually possessed super solider, my best guess is that the term is meant to reference the Odyssean hero, Ulysses. <br />
<br />
The Philosopher’s Stone causes Jeanne to develop a split personality that is a vicious fighter in battle. With her new powers being witnessed in public, Montmorency spreads rumors that Jeanne is a virgin chosen by God to keep her from being tried as a heretic. To plot gets more convoluted when the gender-bent Philippe of Burgundy steals some of Montmorency’s elixir by suddenly kissing him. Montmorency devious cousin, La Trémoille, then seeks an inquisition to discredit Jeanne’s holiness.<br />
<br />
Montmorency and Charlotte (a gender-bent version of Charles VII) refuse to let La Trémoille give Jeanne a *virginity test. As La Trémoille moves in with his forces to capture Jeanne, she transforms into her alternate personality in front of the crowd and this thwarts La Trémoille’s plans, convincing the town that Jeanne is actually a blessed savior. Meanwhile, Philippe puts on an ancient helmet. Using Montmorency’s elixir, she becomes a Dark Ulysses.<br />
*A 15th century virginity test would be Jeanne getting raped.<br />
<br />
During a battle in Orléans, Jeanne fights Philippe but Philippe pierces her heart with the *Lance of Longinus, created out of the elixir, and nearly kills Jeanne. Astaroth then tells Montmorency that the only way to save Jeanne would be to acquire Excalibur, another weapon forged from the Philosopher’s Stone. To receive Excalibur, he must ask his grandfather for troops to find the sword. His grandfather, Jean de Craon, agrees if Montmorency will marry his cousin, Catherine de Thouars—uniting two of the largest families in Brittany. Montmorency refuses because of his dedication to Jeanne, so Catherine de Thouars lies on his behalf—telling Jean de Craon that the two of them had spent a night together. Nicholas Flamel then warns Jean de Craon that Montmorency may become evil.<br />
*Mentioned in the Gospel of John (19:31–37) as the lance that crucified Jesus Christ.<br />
 <br />
Astaroth leads them to Excalibur’s scabbard, where she reveals that she was also The Lady of the Lake that presented Excalibur to King Arthur. Montmorency then uses the scabbard and his elixir to heal Jeanne. Jeanne and Philippe face off again, shortly after her recovery. Philippe blindsides Jeanne by telling her that Montmorency had slept with Catherine de Thouars, and upon Jeanne’s second defeat— Montmorency swallows the rest of the Philosopher’s Stone, becoming a Ulysses himself. After swallowing the stone whole, Montmorency sees the future of *Jeanne’s tragic fate in Rouen. <br />
*In history, Jeanne d’Arc was burned to death at the Vieux-Marché in Rouen.<br />
<br />
Montmorency’s body is then possessed by the Sumerian god, Enlil, and everyone (including Philippe of Burgundy) bands together to banish the evil Enlil from bringing calamity upon the Earth. They end of up banishing Enlil in a dimensional prison. Philippe then begs to be killed, so that she isn’t subjected to the helmet’s bloodlust again. A knight forcefully removes the relic from her head, but is unable to destroy it. The anime adaptation ends with Charlotte (Charles VII) being crowned as Queen (King) of France, and Montmorency, along with Jeanne, are promoted to generals of the French army.<br />
<br />
Comparison to History: The differences in history are vast, I’m not going to include the mystical elements. The characters are aged differently to fit within Montmorency’s age range. When the story begins, it is seven years after the Battle of Agincourt (1422), and historically Jeanne would have been ten year old but in Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc to Renkin no Kishi — she’s twelve. All of the other girls were altered to be considerably younger than their counterparts would have been (Arthur de Richemont, Phillip of Burgundy, and La Hire) with the exception of Charlotte (Charles VII).<br />
 <br />
Obviously the characters attire are not historically accurate either. I mean, who would believe Montmorency, during his announcement of Jeanne’s sainthood, when he’s dressed like a wizard? Ulysses pulls a *Mahō Shōjo Madoka Magika and makes historical figures recipients of the Philosopher’s Stone, including: King Solomon, Clovis I, Otto the Great and Jesus. Also, according to the lore of Ulysses, the Knight’s Templar didn’t want to reclaim Jerusalem, but instead, their goal was to find the Philosopher’s Stone that had been hidden there.<br />
*It is reveled at the end of Madoka Magika that Cleopatra, Queen Himiko, Joan of Arc (Jeanne d’Arc), and Anne Frank were all magical girls.<br />
<br />
And, in real life, Montmorency (Gilles de Rais) dabbled in the occult, but there is no account of him being an alchemist. Not to mention that every anime with Jeanne d&#039;Arc, including Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc to Renkin no Kishi, portrays her as having blonde hair — when in reality, Jeanne d&#039;Arc was said to have had darker hair. In history, Catherine de Thouars doesn’t have lineage linking her to Gilles de Rais. Nor does Gilles de Rais have any connection to the Craon family.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I don’t understand why Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc and the Alchemist Knight gets so much hate. It does the EXACT same thing that Type-Moon did with the Fate series. Fate/stay night characters exchange mana through sex, whereas in the less explicit Ulysses, it’s just saliva. Sure, the animation sucks. So what? There was obviously a lot of passion put into this project. And, yes, it’s not historically accurate, but what fun would a FICTIONAL story be if it had to conform to what actually happened during the 15th century wars.

    I&#039;ve just watched ULYSSES :JEHANNE DARC TO RENKIN NO KISHI and I wanted to share my thoughts and takes about this anime :<br />
<br />
I absolutely loved it !! I would recommand the story because it is different : I believe what&#039;s makes the story special is the fact that the main characters are not overpowered, there is humor, and also dark content which makes it roller coaster of emotions and an enjoyable ride !<br />
<br />
As for the story, alchemy and fantasy makes it more intresting because mostly everyone knows what happened during the Hundred Years War but here these magical elements make way for unexpected scenes and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297849">
        so the story becomes even more intriguing !<br />
<br />
The music is also captivating and the piano is really great for emotional scenes throughout the epidodes!<br />
<br />
I really like the charcaters developping from the 1st to 12th episode and how they change! You can see them turn from kids to adults episodes by episodes all while keeping humor !<br />
<br />
The animation and drawings are beautiful, especially the charcaters design along with the ones for fights and emotional scenes.<br />
<br />
Overall I would truly recommand it for an audience that what to see something different. It is a special anime in it&#039;s own way and that difference is what&#039;s makes it intriguing and captivating at the same time !<br />
<br />
Honestly I really do believe that it is an enjoyable anime due to the fact that the characters are compelling, showing emotions, along with the music, it makes it even better ! Also we can see the characters grow as persons through the entire story by what they say along with the actions they are taking.<br />
<br />
My favorite part about the entire anime it is that despite taking place during dark times during the Middle Ages, the main characters are inspiring because they support one another during difficult time and never let each other down. As a result I believe people watching it can be inspired by it. It is a great attitude to have during difficult times (to help others in need) and in my opinion I think the anime does an excellent job emphasising this character&#039;s trait (whether it is with main characters : Jeanne and Montmorency, or with secondary characters such as La Hire, Richemont, Charlotte, etc..)<br />
<br />
To conclude, I would say it is by far the best anime I&#039;ve watched this year and I can&#039;t wait to see what&#039;s coming next (hopefully a next season or even a spin-off hopefully!

    DO NOT watch this anime. The gigantic oppais might tempt you, but my friend... it&#039;s not worth it. Instead of dishing out the fan service, it gives you a reverse boner, while simultaneously reducing your size by several inches. Yes, I&#039;m not joking.<br />
<br />
*Non-Spoiler Review*<br />
<br />
The story is convoluted and will leave your perplexed at times. Not due to the sheer genius of it, but rather because it makes no goddamn sense in the first place. The majority of people on Earth could probably write a better story than this. One that atleast doesn&#039;t confuse the audience with random events and awkward storytelling.<br />
<br />
The animation is clunky and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297691">
        unappealing. While the art style looks interesting, it is poorly executed. The action scenes, instead of being epic and thrilling, turn out to be kind of hilarious, due to the still frame cuts and appalling animation.<br />
<br />
I do, however, enjoy the ED song, which is probably the best thing about this anime. The art and animation done for the ED is also very appealing, so if you want to watch something from this anime, just skip all the content and watch the ending. It would save you a whole lot of time.<br />
<br />
(Jehanne does sound extremely annoying though.)<br />
<br />
All characters lacked any depth to them. Their actions were awkward and unnatural. While their motives were weak and uninteresting. I don&#039;t have a favorite character from this series, because I couldn&#039;t care less about any of them. The lack of empathy I feel with any of the characters, is a result of the bad storytelling.<br />
<br />
Watching this anime felt like a chore. The only reason I sat down to finish it, was so that I could write a review about it. To tell all of you to stay as far away from this anime as physically possible. I hope you enjoy watching all the other great anime out there, and you can thank me later for saving your hard-earned time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading this review!

    &quot;Good&quot; is not a word LA would place on Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi...rushed?..well that&#039;s an understatement.<br />
<br />
Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi is a retelling and reinterpretation of Jeanne D&#039;Arc&#039;s life with Montmorency voiced by Ryota Osaka as the narrative focus of the anime where he wants to stop the Hundred Year War and get her friends back after 7 years of trying to make the Philosopher Stone.<br />
<br />
Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi&#039;s major problems lies in both it&#039;s plot and animation, first it&#039;s plot.<br />
<br />
The plot first and foremost seems to have a serious problem with pacing, it&#039;s incredibly erratic but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297504">
        mostly rushed to say the least, things just happen soo quickly some without warning or character actions happens and immediately has an aftereffect or sometimes just nonsensically weird. Pacing issues in general just seems rushed, everything from backstories, subtle stories of certain characters just told just because that has almost no weight to the proceeding situations, yes it counts as character development but it feels soo rushed because the anime feels like it&#039;s the pacing it wants it go that way, it&#039;s like a speeding train with no brakes. <br />
<br />
Animation&#039;s in static is decent but in motion, the animation done by AXsiZ just makes crazy nonsensical decisions. LA will note that the camera work, how things just animates even simple movement is just baffling to say the least. The fight scenes also like it&#039;s pacing is erratic, very quick motions, like it&#039;s not stiff but it&#039;s more like split second yet missing some frames to make it more fluid is the best way to say it. Character design wise, the animation is pretty well handled, though the character designs have some questionable decisions, especially with the chest area but sure whatever...*cough* La Hire. If AXsiZ did anything well with it&#039;s animation then it is it&#039;s character designs, everything else....is in the What the F- territory.<br />
<br />
So LA talked lots about the technical flaws of Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi, so what is Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi actually about, well it has fanservice, it has janky fights and has tons of character backstory and sometimes development all under the umbrella of Jeanne D&#039;Arc&#039;s life. The plot?, ohh it&#039;s crazy to say the least especially with how the Philosopher Stone works between Montmorency and Jeanne D&#039;Arc...as in the only way Jeanne D&#039;Arc can go full Jalter is by kissing Montmorency...yes really. Montmorency also gets a harem, from Arthur de Richemont voiced by Manami Numakura, Charlotte de Valois voiced by Saori Oonishi and Philppite Valois Bourgogne voiced by Yuuki Takada, while La Hire voiced by Shizuka Ishigami, a mercenary and Astaroth voiced by Hisako Tojo, the Queen of Fairies aiding Montmorency in a revolution with Jeanne D&#039;Arc as their leading woman. The &quot;villains&quot; Montmorency fights are by far exaggerated villainy, making them far to hammy and though they are intentionally doing this, LA couldn&#039;t take ANY of them seriously. The main villain, Noire, or the black Ulysses has beef with Montmorency but as well as Jeanne D&#039;Arc but the audience well enough knows who she is but feign ignorance when it comes to Montmorency and just makes it one frustrating and two makes Noire be an obstacle to Montmorency....out of love?...like what?...see how nonsensical the plot gets?.<br />
<br />
Oh and for a bit of extra info, Montmorency in his latter year became Bluebeard, aka. GILLE DE RAIS, for those Fate fans, you know where that line of thought goes especially with Montmorency getting a harem of all things. Yeah to say that Ulysses: Jeanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi is historically accurate is laughable be it for creative liberties or not and let&#039;s not even get to the final 3 episodes THAT a bit later. Other info that more or less actually saddened LA was that of Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi being a light novel adaptation by Mikage Kasuga, the same author of Oda Nobuna no Yabou, another retelling and reinterpretation of a famous figure, that being Oda Nobunaga, this time genderbent but somewhat historically accurate nonetheless and LA loved the anime adpatation of Oda Nobuna no Yabou, so why didn&#039;t Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi end up like Oda Nobuna no Yabou did? <br />
<br />
So we have essentially a plot that goes balls deep crazy with some weird way to try to make it quirky yet makes it cringy and blatantly fanservicey for the heck of it, bland characters with a bland main male protagonist who&#039;s really dense to say the least though he&#039;s suppose to be an alchemist and have annoyingly hammy villains or villains&#039; motives making no sense either.<br />
<br />
The voice work isn&#039;t that bad, there is a glimmer of hope for Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi as it&#039;s not the voice actors fault for the material they were given. It at the very least seemed that Shizuka Ishigami just winged it though her character didn&#039;t get much screentime, but as well as her, Hisako Tojo as Astaroth, Yuuko Oono as Jeanne D&#039;Arc and Ryota Osaka as Montmorency did their best. The voice cast is the only element of the anime that LA could get behind...LA just wished the plot, characters and animation just did something to keep up.<br />
<br />
The anime goes off the fucking rails near the final 3 episodes of the anime and sure, Philosopher Stones, split personalities and fairies is one thing, but the anime utterly jumped the shark once these final three episodes landed and by literal god was it a rushed crazy batshit insane swerve it took, from the Holy Grail, Caliburn, demonic Mesopotamian Gods to BABYLON Hole appearing, all sense of logic thrown out and the end of the world...just what in the fuck happened. Like LA can see why the consequences happened like this but LA just fell out of the suspension of disbelief as to how much of a out of nowhere turn it started and executed itself. Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi really turned into a nonsensical mess with those last few episodes, although it was like that early on anyways.<br />
<br />
So there we have it, no, Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi isn&#039;t the worst anime of Fall 2018. Where Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi falls on multiple fronts, from it&#039;s janky and nonsensical animation decisions, to it&#039;s crazy plot where all suspension of disbelief occurs, characters just do things just because, blatant fanservice and finally rushed erratic pacing and quite obviously the glimmer of hope of the voice cast isn&#039;t enough to ignore the flaws Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi gave LA. Oh it&#039;s problems definitely makes this a rather annoying venture for LA, but horrible...no....Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi falls under the category of bile fascination of wanting to see such a trainwreck of an anime and seeing how it goes into crashing and burning and just seeing that fire burn of how an anime this mismanaged goes and LA loved every moment of this trainwreck...it&#039;s a soo bad that it&#039;s good scenario here.<br />
<br />
Ulysses: Jehanne Darc to Renkin no Kishi, your definitely NOT the worst anime of Fall 2018, that special honor goes to a certain siscon anime that aired on the same season, no you are one janky nonsensical mess of an anime and boy did LA liked watching that trainwreck of an anime burn...pun well intended.<br />
<br />
Like seriously Mesopotamian Gods, Babylon, Jeanne D&#039;Arc, Gille de Rais, Caliburn, the Holy Grail..OH MY GOD. Did Mikage Kasuga unintentionally write fan fiction for Fate Grand Order&#039;s Orleans Singularity with Gille de Rais as the main character?

    I gonna say this before writing the review You should watch three episode and decide to whether continue or not don&#039;t ever search for MAL or any other kind of reviews you get to choose and you decide .<br />
<br />
Well where should I start mc is weak from the start weak means he don&#039;t have special power and he had 4 female friends none of them have special powers unlike that fate bullshit where everyone got stupid powers fight for some god damn trophy or something . this series in the beginning one of the mc&#039;s friend Arthur de Richemont (my favorite character in the entire

          <span style="display: none;" id="review348907">
        series) was went to the war and captured by Enemy Don&#039;t worry she didn&#039;t get raped or nothing happen in the anime also even check the LN spoilers nothing happen in the LN also<br />
So after she captured mc was studying alchemy to find a method to save her after 7 years passed he heard his friend was escaped from the enemy he went to search her this on the way he found Jeanne .<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t say much about the story mc and other female characters also had some development and story was great for me . it&#039;s not historically accurate but let&#039;s be real this anime is not to learn history this is for enjoyment only also unlike that fate bullshit this happen in France Jeanne time line so although everything is not history accurate but there was some and author did really amazing job to include those fictional tales about at that time and fairies etc . action scenes were stunning also character designs as well voice acting was really good .<br />
<br />
If I had only thing I found really not to like is Jeanne author had to make her loli and annoying. she acts really stupid except where she use her powers btw theses powers are not some strong ass power like fate series which for me make it way better than it I telling this since there seem to lot of peoples comparing this for fate series and some whining about this begin historically in accurate but fate series done it way worse than this and it even have rape in there which people don&#039;t seems to complain besides this series does not have rape but there is plenty of dark and gore moments in the anime so you would see how dark were those days. Through out the episode 1 to 12 this series had great character development and awesome story progress also great animation I mean fight scenes was really great also on the side note (Oppai was also good ;) )<br />
<br />
Screw all the low rating.  MAL top anime ranking 1-6 all were garbage for ml and this was solid 10/10 I really enjoyed this<br />
<br />
 I wish there was more seasons I also look for the LN but there seems to be no English translate version so far since that I&#039;m planning onto buy the raw version and hire some translators to translate this series<br />
<br />
Also Richemont was totally wifu material<br />

  As It is my first review on this site, I literally can&#039;t ignore the appalling way this plot and story was written. I love history and have been reading more than 70+ books and studies throughout my humble life, but I can&#039;t stand falsified info or giving some known key historical names to characters who are not worth the name or give a male name to a female character just to make the show interesting that&#039;s pretty much tells me how terrible the show is done, and the lack of creativeness. If the author still believes that&#039;s the way to mark her name

          <span style="display: none;" id="review297237">
        in the manga and the anime world as she tried to do the same with &quot;Oda Nobuna no Yabou&quot; then she is totally wrong and she is not that creative after all. if anyone wants to make a historical fantasy, they could by just reading a part of any era and let your imagination go wild as much as they want if they didn&#039;t tamper with the proofs and the outcomes of that period. Also, to be fair for some of the manga and anime with the same genres out there are more worth watching than this one.<br />
I am not saying that you shouldn&#039;t watch the show that&#039;s up to you but put in mind that this show is just another failure. I wish that the author didn&#039;t make it historically based anime rather than just a fantasy one which would maybe make it a better one and durable to watch with the haram plot which was so obvious from the first episode. Also, I hope that in the future there is no more of this unwanted content.<br />
<br />
Now after I said what has been bothering and making me edgy out of my chest, let us go back and review the anime overall:<br />
<br />
Story 1/10<br />
For the previous reasons.<br />
<br />
Art 5/10<br />
There are some minor issues with the characters movements, also, the backgrounds details.<br />
<br />
Sound 4/10<br />
Decent overall.<br />
<br />
Characters 1/10<br />
They are nicely drawn for most of them, but there is no development what so ever for some characters which makes you wonder why were they introduced in the first place. Also, I think that Montmorency has no value since he didn&#039;t deliver any wow factor to keep you really interested in him as someone with a big goal to achieve throughout the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 1/10<br />
As for myself this part differently scaled as see fit for yourself.<br />
<br />
Overall 1/10<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience with me and I hope that you tell if I was mistaken in any way, also, put in mind that my anger towards the show might clouded my fair judgment of it.<br />

    This show starts as a strange alternate-history take on Joanne d&#039;Arc, focused on a group of fairly bland characters, teenage French nobles (all mostly gender-bent version of historical characters, in an AU world when men and women are more or less equals). One of them, Montmorency, finds the philosophical stone while delving into the forbidden art of alchemy. He tries to use it to become immortal and gain the power to protect his friends, but ends up bungling the process and has to pass the stone onto a simple peasant girl named Joanne. Then, he decides to use her as a weapon to liberate France

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304467">
        from the English onslaught and once more protect his friends who all participate in the war.<br />
<br />
While copying a lot of stupid anime tropes, this would still be simply a particularly dumb, quasi-harem action anime, if not for what it did to Joanne herself and her relationship with the protagonist. This series not only made her into an obnoxious, stupid kid, but also forced tons of fanservice and creepy sexual tension into her character, making the whole thing some kind of disturbing lolicon romance. One that, narratively speaking, doesn&#039;t even have to be there - Joanne could&#039;ve been a central character within the story and equally important to the protagonist (who feels responsible for her after putting her multiple times in harms way), while he still romances one of the adult heroines (who are all quite into him, of course) or no one at all...<br />
<br />
Obviously, it would still be a show with obnoxiously shallow and confusing characters (why there&#039;s so much crossdressing, why is everyone so stupid?), a dumb storyline that doesn&#039;t know what to do with its source material and a lot of really creepy fanservice. It would still be trash, maybe a 4/10 kind of series. However, as it is now, it&#039;s disgusting trash - not just from the lolicon angle, but simply because everything that is related to its titular character is misguided and gross. And no, I will give no points to this show for being &quot;self-aware&quot;. It might parody itself in the post-credit sections, but the pathetic quality of its main content does not justify any kind leniency.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s trash, and it&#039;s filth. Do not watch.

    At first glance I thought this anime was appealing and worth a watch. But as the episodes went on, I soon realized how difficult it was to continue watching. The art and sound were ok in my opinion, but the story and characters need improvement. <br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, the show was different from others which i liked but just was not what i was expecting. I did finish it after taking a week break from the last few episodes and am glad i did!<br />
<br />
As to whether i would recommended this to you would be based on what your looking for. The genre stated is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review304424">
        correct but i would also add Harem and drama to it to make it more acurate XD

    I&#039;d recommend this as one of those so-bad-it&#039;s-good series that&#039;s worth watching all the way through. It starts off simple, with magic and fairies. But after a while we&#039;re getting into these ALIEN GODS who control the fairies who don&#039;t want humanity to progress because... it becomes extremely &#039;Kingdom Hearts&#039; is what I&#039;m trying to say.<br />
<br />
This is for you if you think the idea of a fanservice show with a convoluted name that gets sucked into its own bottomless lore hole would be funny. I mean, if you&#039;re already gonna watch the dumb, big booby fantasy shows it may as well be something that goes

    Last year,we has Fate/Apocrypha,this year,it was this show about the hundred years war,Ulysses.There is a common trend with shows that star the legendary Saint Joan of Arc,they fell flat and kind of suck.Ulysses, in particular, was exceptionally bad that I can&#039;t see any significant redeeming point about this show.So,I am going to review one of the worst anime of 2018 right now.<br />
<br />
Story(1/10):Have you ever wrote a story before?Maybe as a student or as an author.One thing is for sure,this anime has a sorry excuse for a story.It is unbelievably bad that even a kid writing a story would write better.To elaborate,firstly,there is no proper transition

        between each episodes,rendering the viewers confused with what this anime is about in the first place,this means that the  episodes feel isolated and substantially lower the overall enjoyment of the viewers.On top of that,the story continuously raise its stakes till gods and spaceships were involved,making the story feel ridiculously horrible due to how this would lower tension in the show as viewers will care less about the stupid nonsense that is happening on the scene.The story also constantly emphasize on boobs,initially it was funny,but it became dull and annoying when boobs were constantly being the &quot;main protagonist&quot;.Lastly,the lack of consistency also hurts this show.The rules of Jeanne as an ulysses was thrown out of the window during the final episodes because plot armor.There is just so many flaws with the story and no redeeming factors to it that ultimately doomed the story of Ulysses.<br />
<br />
Art(4/10):However,I do like the art style of the show,the female characters either look cute or beautiful,increasing aesthetic points for the show.It is unfortunate to say that this is the limit to the positive things I have to say about the visuals.The male characters,on the other hand,are poorly drawn.This is especially the case for the god that spawned with montmorency&#039;s consumption of the philosopher stone.The animation was serviceable up till the action scenes,the action scenes were poorly done with a mix of choppy frames and poor CGI implementation.I also would like to point out the terrible design of the attire of female characters,it is blatantly obvious that they were created to sexualise the characters add nothing else valuable to the characters.Thus,despite some well drawn female characters,the visuals are terrible for almost everything else.<br />
<br />
Sound(7/10):Let us get this straight,the audio isnt amazing.The only reason why I passed it is because I like the opening,there was actual effort put into it.Other than that,the audio was mostly ok and not bad.Thus,I give the sound section a pass.<br />
<br />
Character(1/10):If there was anything missing from the story section,it&#039;ll be here.The first episode has little to no relevance to the second episode.Why?This is as the &quot;heroines&quot; shown in ep 1 are almost irrelevant to the story.In the second episode,we were introduced to Jeanne,whose only quality the show wants us to know is that she is flat.I&#039;m not even joking here.Montmorency,the main character,is Gilles de Rais,the famous serial killer dude from France.That has nothing to do with the story because our male protagonist doesnt act like Gilles in any way,he is a boring character who cares about his friends and can be quite a coward unless he has the power of friendship or waifus.Other than that,the other characters are pretty much just one-dimensional.The females are head over heels over Montmorency,amplifying his only use as a self insert.This is a huge problem as characters like Charlotte need more characterization to show why she should even be queen of France.Even when the God was going to destroy the world,the only thing that the female cast cares about is whether Montmorency will live.The characters,in summary,are a huge disaster.<br />
<br />
Overall,this anime is crippled with bad characters,bad writing and generally what seems to be a lack of understanding of the setting.I am not sure whether this anime is supposed to be a huge joke or a serious product because it is so bad that I cannot see how anyone would agree to participating in this project.This anime could have been decent,but unfortunately,having Joan of Arc as a protagonist in an anime has seen nothing but failure,and this show is the biggest failure of the bunch.Although I have a general distaste for this show,I will not be encouraging people to skip this show,that is up to you all to decide after seeing all the reviews that have been put up on this show.Thank you for your time.

       Warning: This review contains some spoilers.<br />
<br />
   In the year 2019, you would expect anime to have top quality animation at this point, but unfortunately, this is not the case. Jeanne&#039;D Arc and the Alchemist Knight shows us otherwise perfectly in an entertaining way. Along with its many other countless flaws, this is the anime you would find countless copies of in the clearance section of a Five Below, if anime CDs were sold in American stores.<br />
<br />
   There is no need for me to summarize the plot. You find out what the show is about in the synopsis. However,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review309400">
        what I will write about are the many problems with the plot. First of all, the plot offers nothing original or interesting that will grasp the viewer&#039;s attention. A war between two countries, has been done before. A magical stone that has the power to give someone supernatural powers, does not sound very original at all. While I don&#039;t think the originality of the plot determines the quality of the plot, this show seriously lacks originality. What is worse about the plot is just how many times they cross the line. If you dislike fan service like I do, then this show will be dreadful. Traps, fan service with lolis, romance between siblings, nearly every female character with a major role possessing impossibly large breasts (with the exception of Jeanne and Astaroth), this show has it all. This may be a plus for people who are into that sort of thing, but it all just leaves a bad taste for me. The show also contains many plot holes that left me frustrated. For example, when La Hire was battling the demon, she stabbed herself and somehow also became Ulysses. Why? Was there another Philosopher&#039;s Stone? Was she always a Ulysses? This was never explained. Also during the same fight, Jeanne became Ulysses multiple times. However in the show, Montmorrency states that Jeanne can only remain in her Ulysses form for three minutes a day. The show never explains why suddenly, Jeanne can become Ulysses multiple times in the same fight. Overall, the plot is unoriginal, contains uncomfortable content, and contains many holes in it, especially in the end.<br />
<br />
   The characters for this show are nothing more than forgettable. Montmorrency himself feels like you typical boring anime harem protagonist. Jeanne is a typical innocent loli character who the creators just love to put her in fetish-like situations. You have a trap character who is probably gay. Astaroth is just like Aqua, except not funny and enjoyable. Finally, you have all the other forgettable big-breasted characters with no personality. There was not a single memorable, or even at least mildly amusing character in this show.<br />
<br />
   The opening was average. Nothing special about the visuals or song itself. Reminded me of Campione&#039;s opening somewhat. The ending was a more calming song that contained painted visuals. The art tried to match the style of paintings back in the time of the setting of the story. Nothing memorable or special about the songs.<br />
<br />
   The animation, while is terrible, is probably the most entertaining aspect of the show. I&#039;m not the one to be overly critical about the animation, but this show&#039;s animation mistakes were everywhere, especially in episode nine of the show. It was bad, but entertaining. Awkward angles, out of focus frames, bad CG, and amateur editing all makes this show a little bit more bearable to watch. This is what I meant at the beginning of the review. As for the art style, it was good, but nothing iconic or special about it. The voice acting was also pretty good for this anime (if your&#039;e watching dubbed), but ended up as wasted talent and time for Funimation.<br />
<br />
   Overall, this was one of the worst animes I&#039;ve watched. It left me frustrated, uncomfortable, and full of regret, as I could have spent the time used to watch Jeanne D&#039;Arc to instead do bottle flips for five hours, because then at least I would be exercising my wrist. Don&#039;t watch this show. It&#039;s not even worth the wait of the loading webpage on some pirated anime streaming website. If you want to see the hilarious animation mistakes, I recommend watching Sugarpunch&#039;s review of this anime on Youtube. He does a great job of pointing out the animation errors in far more detail than I have.

    Man I can&#039;t believe my teacher gave me an F on my history exam for saying Joan D&#039;Arc stopped an alien invasion during the Hundred Years&#039; War between France and England. <br />
<br />
No but seriously I gotta say, I am pretty impressed with myself that I completed this entire show in one sitting. <br />
<br />
Ulysses: Jeanne d&#039;Arc to Renkin no Kishi is the retelling of story of Joan D&#039;Arc from the perspective of Montmorency. If you are a fan of harem romances with occasional action and like the usual shenanigans that come with these romantic comedies, you&#039;ll probably enjoy this show for the most part. Action was

          <span style="display: none;" id="review302244">
        decent mainly because of the music that usually goes with it when Jeanne goes into super sonic mode (it is called Ulysses mode in the show).  <br />
<br />
Pacing for the show was kind of all over the place for the most part. Some characters (I am looking at you La Hire) get too much screen time for no reason. Astaroth seems to have a story to tell, but even after completing the series, I still don&#039;t know her story. I also feel Montmorency could have benefited more from more interactions with the other girls, but I guess the writers wasn&#039;t interested in it. Frankly speaking, I wasn&#039;t interested in him either because after watching Fate/Zero I just can&#039;t get that crazy mage out of my head everytime they call him &quot;Gille&quot;.<br />
<br />
The music was alright, most are unnoticeable. The most memorable OST for me was &quot;命乞いして鳴き叫べ&quot;, it is the one where Jeanne goes into Ulysses mode and starts blitzing everyone.<br />
<br />
The animation wasn&#039;t very good for me, sometimes I see disproportionate faces and it becomes pretty clear towards the end of the series the animators barely give a rat&#039;s ass. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the ending...god damn did the last two episodes confuse the crap out of me. I think it is one of those things where you have to read the original source to understand. <br />
<br />
Now the big question you all want to know is, does the romance lead anywhere? The answer is, yes Montmorency does choose someone. But since this show is technically inconclusive, we won&#039;t know the true ending and I can&#039;t see this show getting a season two.

    Ulysses is an abomination that rose from hell.Its the one of the worst anime i have ever seen.It starts off consistently bad but than takes a darling in the Franxx route and goes insane .<br />
<br />
Story-1<br />
If I told you that the premise is about an anime version of a real life murderer , pedophile and rapist who makes out with a 12 year old girl to give her super powers would you believe it ?<br />
WOULD YOU ?<br />
So in order to clarify the main character<br />
Montemorency based on real life Gilles de Rais (look him up) is an alchemist knight who has the power of the philosopher stone

          <span style="display: none;" id="review299767">
        and can give super powers to certain people . Mainly a 12 year old version of Joan of Arc who wears revealing battle dresses. I can probably write 5 more paragraphs about the story but ehh.<br />
<br />
Art-1<br />
Now , The art is bad. The characters look like they would fit in if you threw their designs at some Sci-Fi anime because of how godamn much they look different compared to your regular background characters. That&#039;s just one part the biggest part is the fact that the knights are CGI and look dreadful.<br />
The English knights wear some robot looking armor and the french wear somewhat realistic looking armor (not completely realistic but hey this is anime so ill let it slide) both look terrible because CGI . The backgrounds are dull and boring and yes that&#039;s what i have to say about the art.<br />
<br />
Sound-3<br />
Ehh the soundtrack is forgettable and not unique at all but it doesn&#039;t sound like dogshit so it gets a 3.<br />
<br />
Characters-1<br />
I have sooo much to say about how terrible these characters are . Montemorency is like a typical harem anime character in the sense he is boring , dull and has nothing interesting or fascinating about him. Now the other characters are simply tropes and stereotypes you have Jeanne or Joan of Arc who&#039;s a typical Loli , La hire (real mercenary commander turned into a buxom lady) is a typical badass mercenary type character who&#039;s not interesting at all you also have Arthur de Raimond (real guy turned into a buxom anime girl) some caring sister archetype i think ? Phillip the good (turned into a girl as well) shy and boring later becomes worse but spoilers and The king of France who&#039;s a queen and turned into a buxom girl and does literally nothing. Yes, historical dudes are turned into girls *cough* *cough* Fate *cough* *cough*<br />
<br />
Enjoyment-1<br />
PATHETIC. This is anime excluding how bad its concepts is just really boring if you ignore all of those . Its drama is nothing its characters have almost no development and yeah thats why it is.<br />
<br />
Overall-1<br />
One of the worst anime i watched and i don&#039;t recommend this at all unless they want to torture themselves and if you do get ready for Episode 10......
