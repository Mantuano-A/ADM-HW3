    Seriously, is  it that bad to find this show entertaining? One can argue this is a typical slice of life, school, harem anime with typical character types and predictable story and you would not be far off. But, if you don&#039;t LIKE watching things like this, why are you watching it in the first place? Akane-iro is geared to the &#039;veteran&#039; otaku who love specific voice actors or character types, or enjoy when different flags get triggered (like hot springs, school festivals, or costume changes) aka: fanservice. You can only watch so many different slice of life harem comedy titles to realize if you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25383">
        like this particular genre or not. This genre lends itself to a lot of off the wall stories and anyone expecting something &quot;realistic&quot; will realize a true &quot;anime&quot; (aka normal anime) is not realistic at all. Which is why certain things feel obvious after you watch title after title. Why do you think there are 1000&#039;s of anime titles, but only about a few dozen genres. As for me I am a fan (not a raging fan mind you) of these types of anime. I am pretty sure I am not the only one in the world that found this entertaining for what its worth. <br />
<br />
Just like in life, if you expect one thing and get something else, you&#039;re bound to be disappointed. Watching this with an open mind, you will realize that Akane-Iro ni Somaru Saka is actually a very entertaining and funny anime. Like most slice of life school comedy harems, a premise is presented at the beginning of the show, which is usually far fetched but bound for some form of entertainment. If you read the anime summary you&#039;ll get the gist, but it does generate enough laughs and surprises to keep you entertained for 12 episodes. An amazing feat that many fail to miss is that 8 of the 10 characters get relatively large amounts of airtime for every episode. With that, the story seems to progress relatively quick and seamless. Sometimes you won&#039;t realize the episode is over before you know it. <br />
<br />
A big reason you get sucked into this anime are the character-types and voice actors lined up for this show. Alot of A-list seiyuu like Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, and Wataru Hatano, headline the cast of characters. Big fan&#039;s of seiyuu like these, will be surprised at how well they lend their voices to these characters. Its inevitable that one will grow attached to one or some (all?) of these characters. Yeah yeah, you&#039;ve seen these character types everywhere else, who the hell cares? The whole point of having these character types is to have a great chemistry between all the characters and this exceeded my expectations with flying colors (whatever that means). Fang-tan, ahoge-san, and company are all there, the comedy is pretty good and and the drama is just as good as well. The drama doesn&#039;t show itself too much to get in the way of the comedy aspect of this series but it is a warm welcome from the &#039;incomplete&#039; dramas like the ones that never come to fruition (Honey and Clover, 5cm/s, etc). Characters progress perfectly fine in this story. You&#039;ll feel happy for some and sad for others, that is the nature of drama. In other titles that may get annoying but its perfectly fine in this series. One other thing that I highly enjoyed about this series is that the main character in the center of the harem, Junichi Nagase, was actually not a bad guy. Sure he might have his moments, but overall he was very outgoing and more &quot;realistic&quot; compared to most other male harem leads. Even the scenes when he&#039;s battling his conscience were especially funny.  <br />
<br />
The production value is actually very high compared to your typical anime. The art design hardly ever faltered and never felt like a rushed product. Some people might be put off by the floating hairstyle of some of the girls, but I didn&#039;t mind it one bit. The details they put in to all the characters including the background characters is something to be commended. Every scene is filled with either characters or static objects. What does that even mean? That means when there isn&#039;t a close up of characters talking to each other, theres usually a large amount of detail to panning or zoomed out shots. Passed out cooks in a kitchen, well placed furniture in Minato&#039;s room, or Nagomi&#039;&#039;s computer setup are good examples that show enough detail to keep every scene busy and with some depth. The art is far form being perfect but for what its worth, it more than does the job. On top of the great voice acting and art direction, they even have character music cd&#039;s available for each character and even give previews of their songs in the form of a new ending song for each episode. Sure it may be a gimmick, but you can&#039;t deny how great they can sing and how they managed to conjure up a few dozen songs just for this show. There are also a few drama cd&#039;s to supplement your fix of akane-iro after you&#039;re done with the series. It seems like the producers thought of everything short of a video game for this show.<br />
<br />
I never felt this was a waste of my time or got annoyed by the characters. Actually this is one of the more complete cast of characters that I have seen (out of 400 titles). I don&#039;t think I need to mention Code Geass, Hayate, TTGL, and Death Note but I will anyway since most of those characters made me rage at how many of them left many cliffhangers or a feeling of &quot;needing something&quot;. Despite being a typical harem comedy anime, it&#039;s the small things that kept me wanting to watch more. The segments of Junichi&#039;s conscience and the analogy between Junichi&#039;s parents and the gang&#039;s current situation were pretty funny imo.<br />
<br />
As far as slice of life/harem/comedies go this is easily one of the better ones. Its compete in almost every way. Great character chemistry and seiyuu Amazing amount of detail (down to the nipple, har). All crammed in a 12 episode package. What is not to like? If you don&#039;t like harem comedy this will obviously become fodder for low scoring. Especially for the fools who try to find seriousness in comedy... THEY WILL LOSE THE GAME.<br />
<br />
Hell, hearing Rie Kugimiya say &quot;Stop licking already and eat me&quot; is well worth the price of admission. <br />
<br />
One of the best lines is uttered in this anime too: &quot;If you want to dream, go dream while you&#039;re sleeping&quot; Priceless.

    Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is an anime that hurts itself by raising expectations and failing to meet them like clockwork. It goes out of its way to repeatedly build from mediocrity only to plunge itself back down to the point where you wonder why you even gave it much of a chance. It&#039;s someone jumping out of a 3 story building and landing on concrete, only to climb back up and jump over and over again. Until the person&#039;s bones are mush and the series limps to its god-awful ending.<br />
<br />
As a series in general, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka (from here on, Akasaka) is passable, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10780">
        would go as far to say it&#039;s decent and occasionally enjoyable. Its gaping flaws are grossly magnified, rightly, by its constant, flagrant disappointment of its viewers. Basically Akasaka is not pure bad (far from it) but the parts that are actually good makes the parts that are bad look really bad. <br />
<br />
Akasaka is based off Feng&#039;s visual novel released back in 2007. The plot revolves around a boy by the name of Jun&#039;ichi Nagase, who attends a prestigious high school and seems to bear some kind of tough reputation from middle school. Think typical harem school comedy male protagonist. There, I just developed the character to the same degree 12 episodes of Akasaka did. Anyhow, a naive aloof rich girl, Katagiri Yuuhi (CV: Kugimiya Rie), transfers to Jun&#039;ichi&#039;s school and Jun&#039;ichi, out of some act of divine inspiration kisses her, causing unspeakable chaos. Then, to close out a rather promising first episode and establish a quite original premise, it turns out that Yuuhi is Junichi&#039;s fiancee due to an arranged marriage.<br />
<br />
Akasaka&#039;s female cast is chock full eye-catching and potentially interesting characters. Expectations: high. The series proceeds to do nothing with all but two of the girls. Expectations: failed. <br />
<br />
Like many similar anime, Akasaka&#039;s plot (the plot is essentially just the premise) takes a back seat episodes 3-10 for some good unrelated episodes of fun. That&#039;s fine! It&#039;s a structure that has worked countless times. And by all means it can work here. But instead, Akasaka is filled extremely cliche situations solved in extremely cliche ways. For example, Jun&#039;ichi&#039;s sister Minato (CV: Hirano Aya) takes Yuuhi shopping in a supermarket to make dinner. Six minutes of pointless dialogue about how amazed Yuuhi is of instant curry follows. We get it after the first few lines! Yuuhi talks about how she eats at home as Kugimiya Rie butchers French Japanese transliteration. She&#039;s rich, naive, aloof, we get that. Is it supposed to be funny that Yuuhi doesn&#039;t know about instant curry and thinks that her cooks and servants don&#039;t either? How overblown does the reaction and enlightenment need to be? There are lots of girls in this anime, some who look pretty interesting. Are we going to get episodes about them? With curry? That actually would be pretty awesome...<br />
<br />
Watching anime should never be physically painful, but that&#039;s what I felt as this series slowly killed itself. It&#039;s the pain you feel a promising show wastes all the good things it had going for it and falls into mediocrity. Akasaka occasionally strikes silver (no gold in this show, sorry) with a few lines of interesting dialogue and good animation, but after every good or decent episode or plot development the series feels as if it has some obligation to make up for it by spewing crap at our face. It&#039;s like you&#039;re at an amusement park and every time you have some fun, a burly security guard has to give you a swift punch in the gut. The ending begins suddenly in the last 3 episodes and was likewise promising. Too bad the conclusion of the series was so predictable that I might as well have drawn the storyboards myself and the things that you didn&#039;t predict either have no relevance to the plot or are so cheesy and/or wrong you&#039;re better off not predicting it. <br />
<br />
I&#039;m a little harsh on this series because it really is a shame. Akasaka goes to show you how bad writing can absolutely destroy a series with everything else going for it. The art is good, the characters and landscapes are well drawn and fun to look at. Akasaka has a voice acting cast that would remind you of the New York Yankees, with the resulting mediocrity to match. When we have Kugimiya Rie (Shana, Louise, Taiga), Inoue Marina (Chiri from Zetsubou Sensei, Yoko from TTGL), Aya Hirano (Haruhi, Konata, Misa from Death Note) and Tanaka Rie (Chi from Chobits, Sugintou) in the same anime, we&#039;re going to be excited. I had my eye on this series ever since voice actors were announced and some art was available. <br />
<br />
In the end, the voice acting was pretty good but by itself it cannot save a series. The music (besides the terrible OP) is good. It better be good when you have five voice actors with best selling seiyuu albums on your staff. Should there be an OVA about the supporting characters I would most likely flock to it with expectations held high. I&#039;ve heard that the game this is based off was really cool. Too bad I can&#039;t say the same for the anime adaptation.

    There are some shows that really have no business being bad.  Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is one of those.  When you look at the talent gathered for this series it practically reads as a who’s who of seiyuu talent.  Unfortunately it is that talent that is one of the few bright spots in what is otherwise a pretty dismal series.<br />
<br />
The story unfolds as your standard harem anime.  I always find some of the ridiculous situations these writers come up with quite hilarious.  A spoiled rich girl ends up living with a pair of siblings (not related by blood of course,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15284">
        more on that later) who just happen to not have any parents around because they are busy being John Steed and Emma Peel.  Of course our rich girl, Yuuhi Katagiri hates our hero Junichi but announces anyway that they are now fiancées.  I wonder if this kind of stuff really happens in Japan, because it happens an awful damn lot in anime and manga.  So despite me really wanting to like this at the beginning, this show has managed to get itself off to a bad start with me.<br />
<br />
However I did start to become pleasantly surprised as the story unfolded.  Slowly we are treated to a pretty sweet little romance as Yuuhi and Junichi develop feelings for one another, confess and start down a path I felt was leading to a lovely romantic ending.  That’s when they screwed it all up to hell.  It’s going to be damn hard for me to express my disappointment with the turn this show made about halfway through without giving away too many spoilers.  But it involves the ultra moe sister Minato and Japan&#039;s obsession with incestuous relationships involving close family members.  Yes the anime does take great pains to point out that Minato and Junichi are not biological siblings.  That’s not the point; your blood isn’t the only thing that makes you family.  If you’re raised as brother/sister you&#039;re brother/sister, regardless of what your birth certificate says.  In no way should siblings who know they are siblings be romantic interests.  Even though this is a harem romance with many possible choices for the lead to make it very clearly becomes a choice between Minato and Yuuhi.  It’s creepy, disturbing, and completely disgusting.<br />
<br />
As characters, there is nothing particularly interesting about the three leads.  If you have one harem you’ve seen this one.  I only found the mains compelling for about the first half of the series before Minato became a love interest.  I did find most of them likable in the beginning just not original or inspiring.  The supporting cast has little to recommend either and is largely just background scenery.  Probably the silliest characters of all are Minato and Junichi&#039;s parents as their various spy stories are told throughout the series.  These have nothing to do with the main plot and feel totally out of place and stupid.  I think it was supposed to be clever and witty.  Fail.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, Akane-iro does a great job with its voice cast and music.  We are treated to quite a bit of songs, as there are a lot of ending themes sung by almost all of the seiyuu who do singing work.  It’s a shame that the story and dialogue were not on par with their talent.  I am not a huge fan of the art though.  It reminds me a lot of CLAMP, tall way to thin characters that are just too &quot;beautiful&quot;.  Big eyes, cutesy hair accessories, and gravity defying bosoms and boys who could easily double as girls if you have those boobs and skirts dominate.<br />
<br />
In the end this series was a prime example of how to waste great acting talent with a clichéd story, lackluster production values, and creepy plot elements.  Giving it a 6 is probably generous to how disappointing I found this series as a whole, but I really did enjoy the first half of this anime a lot.  If you simply must see every harem romance out there and are not bothered by incest then by all means watch this.

    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br />
<br />
(At Studio TNK)<br />
<br />
Director [clapping his hands]: Okay, people. The next anime we&#039;re going to produce is Akane-iro ni somaru saka. Now, before we start production, I want everyone to play the visual novel and list out every event and trope that you believe should be included into the anime version. You have one week to complete this game.<br />
<br />
[One Week Later]<br />
<br />
Director [looking around the room]: Alright. I want everyone to hand in their lists. [Everyone begins to pass their list to the director.] Okay, thank you. Now, here’s what will happen. A few assistants and I will now tally up the tropes that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190410">
        should be included into the anime version. The tropes with the most tallies will be included into the series. Only the top 20 tropes will be included. Thank you, we will see you in a few hours.<br />
<br />
[Several Hours Later]<br />
<br />
Director [clearing his throat]: After, tallying the results, we have found 20 tropes that everyone in this room can agree with. Here are the tropes:<br />
<br />
– Bland and Boring Protagonist.<br />
– Your Soon-to-Become-Fiance Living at the Protagonist’s House.<br />
– Younger Sister in Love with Protagonist.<br />
– Childhood Friend in Love with Protagonist.<br />
– Rich Ojou-Sama in love with Protagonist.<br />
– Best Friend Helping the Protagonist.<br />
– The Student Council Involved with Protagonist.<br />
– Violent Tsundere Character abusing the Protagonist.<br />
– Dinner Involving Curry and Rice.<br />
– Supernatural Events.<br />
– Typical ‘Test of Courage’ Event.<br />
– &#039;Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girls’ Event<br />
– Random Mechs and Action Scenes.<br />
– Lots of Fanservice (i.e. swimsuits, boobs, underwear).<br />
– Home Sick Event.<br />
– Hidden Porn Magazines.<br />
– Cultural Festivals.<br />
– Maid Cafe.<br />
– Mountain Resort with Hot Spring.<br />
– Incest Ending.<br />
<br />
Director: I want all these events and tropes into this anime series. Next, I want the tsundere character, Yuuhi Katagiri, to be voiced by Rie Rugimiya. Also known as the ‘Queen of Tsundere’. <br />
<br />
[The Head Producer looks at him with an unsurprised face.]<br />
<br />
Director: Don&#039;t look at me like that. I mean, come on, Yuuhi Katagiri is rude, abusive, and not very honest with her feelings. The only seiyuu that performs tsundere characters perfectly is Rie Rugimiya. Then, I want Aya Hirano to be on board, as she&#039;s a famous seiyuu with high credibility and does excellent voice overs for both soft-spoken and loud-spoken characters. In this case, she will play as the soft-spoken character Minato Nagase with special hidden abilities and talents.<br />
<br />
Head Producer [raising his hand]: What about animation and story?<br />
<br />
Director [thinking]: Have little background details as possible, mainly focus on the school, Nagase&#039;s home, and lots of random scenes with snow. Next, have minimal facial details for each character, make them almost similar to each other. Keep it simple. Then, I want each of the girls to have a different hair-style with bright hair colors, mostly brown, pink, yellow, gray, etc. But, lastly, I want every character to produce an exaggerated expression for every action. <br />
<br />
Director [taking a deep breath]: Now, for the story, I want it to be simple. Nothing too complex or deep, make it sightly predictable, except towards the end. I wants lots of random filler episodes in the middle and then, add many main story points towards the end. Keep the dialogue and interactions simple, mainly discussing about food, love, and reasons for why all the girls love the protagonist. Finally, add some stupid comedy that might or might not make the viewers laugh and then, add many random supernatural events to which there is have no reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Head Producer [looking shocked]: If that is what you want, then I’ll do it. <br />
<br />
[He stands up and heads towards the door with everyone else. Suddenly, the director stops him.]<br />
<br />
Director: I forgot to say. Keep it to only one season, no sequels.  And have one OVA, which is mainly filled with fanservice material, so we can pander to the fans.<br />
<br />
Head Producer [looking relief]: Now, that is what I want to hear. I’ll get to work, right away.<br />
<br />
<br />

    Watching Akane-iro is akin to dating the hot blond in class, only to find out that the most exciting conversation they can field is who Britanny Spears will date next.<br />
<br />
Akane-iro certainly had potential. Attractive character designs, famous voice actors, a decent sound track. <br />
<br />
Sure, like the desire to go out with blond bombshell, the story of a girl forced to move into the house of his future fiancee... who *happens* to be a your average anime guy who just also* happens* to have a hot sister is not exactly original. But you think<br />
<br />
&amp;quot;Hey, the voice actors and animations are good, and such stories, no matter

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9776">
        how cliched, can be fun.&amp;quot;<br />
<br />
Too bad that after a few dates (episodes), the shallowness of series reigns supreme. Spas, School Festivals, Guy and girl landing in awkward positions... they&#039;re all here. While any anime featuring an over abundance of such scenes will not be a masterpiece, some can execute them well enough to at be pretty good.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Akane-iro fails more than it succeeds, each filler episode is a cliches of cliches, with as much unexpected events and funny moments as watching your cat drink a bowl of milk. The visuals are cute, but nothing&#039;s going to make you stare at for 30 minutes straight.<br />
<br />
Are there any redeeming qualities for Akane-iro?  It may be worth watching for the few scattered non-filler episodes that are surprisingly good (Episode 5 and 11  on their own would score a 9), but these only serve to highlight how abysmal most of the filler episodes are , (say 4, 6 and 7), which land firmly in the 4 - 6 category. <br />
<br />
Akane-iro&#039;s deserves only to run as a small window at the bottom corner of your screen, whose only purpose to provide a minor distraction as you try to finish that blasted assignment.<br />

    Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is a Romantic, Comedy like any other. That’s pretty much all there is to describe this mediocre anime series and if that doesn’t satisfy your information needs then by all means continue with this review.<br />
<br />
“Seen it, been there, done that…” Those are the thoughts that came to mind whilst I watched the first episode. It starts of ordinary enough when some posh girl (Yuuhi) is helped out by some guy (Junichi), who’s pretty well-known for some stupid rumour. Well at the beginning of the new school semester it comes to no surprise that said girl transfers to Junichi’s school and thus

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11619">
        begins their rocky relationship. Now I’ve got to say the end of the 1st episode was pretty funny because it was rather unexpected but after that brief moment this anime soon reminds us that sticking with the norm isn’t always the best choice. Here we have a barrage of anime tropes &amp; clichés however I think this anime goes out of its way to contain every single romantic comedy cliché imaginable, including the arranged engagement between Yuuhi &amp; Junichi and the two living together.<br />
<br />
For the most part it is a series of random misadventures ranging from stuff like the old abandon school expeditions and even these mundane moments could have been more interesting if the characters weren’t so ordinary. There are a whole bunch of characters here, like the typical nurturing sister whose name I forget but the only ones worth mentioning are the main pair Junichi &amp; Yuuhi. Like a lot of people I absolutely hate the loser type protagonist that appear in the romance genre, which is why I should like Junichi for not falling into the category but sadly apart from some amusing moments I just can’t seem to get used to this guy who always seems to have a chip on is shoulder. It doesn’t help when there’s a heroine like Yuuhi, where you just have to think of her as an older version of Nagi (Hayate no Gotoku!).<br />
<br />
Well it’s no surprise that Nagi comes to mind as they both share the same voice actor and there are also other similar voices to be found here, seeing how this anime has a lot of well-known VAs and sadly that’s what stands out and not the music or the cheesy SFX. The animation on the other hand just doesn’t stand out at all. With a very similar look to anime such as; H20 &amp; School Days, the only feature that seems to stand out are the girl’s exaggerated hair that no one could find appealing.<br />
<br />
Overall Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka actually had a decent romance going on at some points but the random misadventure only proved to be a great annoyance to the story &amp; the romance’s progression. Stuff that’s supposed to be funny just wasn’t but at least there are a few random things to chuckle at. In the end I was driven to despair, because this anime actually had some potential but did its best to ruin it every step of the way.

    Well... honestly, I don&#039;t know why I enjoyed watching Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka like I did, but here I am. I didn&#039;t take it seriously, though, for it was impossible to take it seriously. While I was watching it I was really just making fun of it most of the time. Why, you might ask? Well&amp;hellip; it was just so darn stupid. Clich&amp;eacute;d. Annoying. You get the picture.<br />
<br />
The story centers around a seemingly normal guy named Junichi, who rescues a tempered girl named Yuuhi (what is up with that girl&amp;rsquo;s hair?) from some guys who were trying to pick her up (oh wow, an example

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10520">
        of pure originality right there&amp;hellip; not), and after misunderstandings arise and a first kiss ensues, it turns out that Yuuhi just happens to be Junichi&amp;rsquo;s fianc&amp;eacute;e. So she lives with him in his house under conditions of her father to see if he is a suitable fianc&amp;eacute;, along with Junichi&amp;rsquo;s well-endowed sister Minato, etc, etc, etc. Now, this story has some potential&amp;hellip; sort of. But the episodes were filled with so many clich&amp;eacute;d moments it was just&amp;hellip; bad. You know those moments, the romantic kind maybe where someone &amp;ldquo;accidentally gropes the girl&amp;rsquo;s breast&amp;rdquo; or someone &amp;ldquo;accidentally falls on top of the other person&amp;rdquo;. The typical &amp;ldquo;filler type episodes&amp;rdquo; are there too, such as a trip to the onsen or the &amp;ldquo;school festival episode&amp;rdquo;. These type of things can actually be fun to watch, for though they&amp;rsquo;re repeated, they&amp;rsquo;re repeated for the reason that they can bring enjoyment to an audience. However, in Akane-iro, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t funny or interesting or really&amp;hellip;anything.<br />
<br />
Now for characters. I am sorry to say there is not one character in this cast that I actually like. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why exactly, but none of the characters are likeable. None of them are original, though Junichi is a different protagonist than the general guy caught up in a harem of this sort. As the series progresses, you are supposed to either side with Yuuhi or side with Minato. This would make sense, typical love triangle. There is one tiny problem though&amp;hellip; Minato is Junichi&amp;rsquo;s younger sister. Meaning, incest themes abound! For a while I&amp;rsquo;d thought that Minato was adopted, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if it was ever fully explained&amp;hellip; so that was pretty stupid. I might have missed something though because sometimes I didn&#039;t pay attention. Go watch it yourself and see. Anyway, Yuuhi is the typical tsundere type, which I either really like or just am annoyed by completely. Unfortunately the latter won out the former on that one. Minato is more of a sweet, intelligent, and good at housekeeping type of girl, which also annoys me. Junichi&amp;rsquo;s friends, the minor characters, were okay, like Fuyuhiko and Tsukasa. The student body president amazed me with her absolutely insane hair. Forget the comment about Yuuhi&amp;rsquo;s hairstyle, just look at Mitsuki Siina! Seriously, how does she do it? Does she get up at 3 AM and just slap on the hairspray?<br />
<br />
Anyway. Moving onto sound, which is the reason I actually started watching this show. I came across it randomly from what I saw a friend was watching and I decided to watch it not only because it was on a whim but because of the popular voice actresses in this series, like Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, Emiri Katou, and Inoue Marina. They all did a good job, all the voices fit their characters. But for some reason, I just could not stand Junichi&amp;rsquo;s voice at all. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why&amp;hellip; I guess I just didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. The music didn&amp;rsquo;t stand out much, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the opening theme at all, though it could get in your head (regrettably so). I never much paid attention to the many ending themes. They were sung by the various voice actresses I believe.<br />
<br />
The animation&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s okay, but it&amp;rsquo;s not that good. Movements are generally stiff, the anatomy often looks wrong with people out of proportion. It&amp;rsquo;s not fluid and it has no flair. It&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to look at, I suppose.<br />
<br />
I was going to give this a 5&amp;hellip; but I suppose I shall give it a 6, for I did like watching it most of the time, even though I thought it was terrible.<br />

    Akane-Iro ni Somaru Saka is the newest eroge adaptation by TNK, which are more famous for their work in School Days. Oh, another eroge made into an anime...inb4lameharemrite? Thats probably one of the first thoughts what will cross your mind when approaching this title, and to be honest you are not that wrong. If you cannot handle these times of anime, then you might as well give this a pass.<br />
<br />
Story: The story is nothing out of the ordinary for this anime, it follows a lot of cliches many animes have done in the past for this genre. The main heroine Katagiri Yuuhi, gets into trouble

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9210">
        with some strangers, and gets rescued by the main lead Nagase Junichi. After a series of misunderstandings we learn that Yuuhi is Junichi&#039;s fiancee as decided by their parents. And now they must learn to get along while Yuuhi lives with Junichi and his sister Minato.<br />
<br />
Art: In terms of art this showed a lot of promise. With interesting and beautiful character designs that look perfect as long as they are still shots, because unfortunately throughout the series there were times where the animators got sloppy and the characters looked distorted and sometimes plain ugly.<br />
<br />
Sound: In terms of sound, this is probably where most of the people will get drawn into the show. The voice cast of this anime is just something to make your jaw drop, we have top quality voicing from Kugimiya Rie, Hirano Aya, Hirohashi Ryou, Tanake Rie, Katou Emiri, Inoue Marina, and more playing major roles in this show. And they all portray their characters very well as expected by such good seiyuus. On voice cast alone the sound part would get 10/10 but VA is not all there is to an anime. The actual music used for the anime is rather simple and none really stand out much. So 8/10 is a fair score to give this show.<br />
<br />
Character: This is probably both the best and worst part of the anime. The characters are diverse and interesting, and you feel like you wanna learn more about all of them. However the anime only focus on the main heroine Yuuhi most of the time leaving the rest of the cast in the shadows. And then the anime proceeds to throwing away all effort they put in character development with a very disappointing ending. It feels like the anime wasted a great cast of characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: I would be lying if I said I didnt enjoy the show somehow. It certainly wasnt that great of an anime, but it had its moments where I honestly had fun watching it. It depends on your tolerance with these types of animes.<br />
<br />
Overall: The show was nothing out of the ordinary. A lot of stereotypes and pretty terrible writting and producing turned this anime from something that had a lot of potential into something mediocre with not much to remember. It feels like this show could&#039;ve been much more that it ended up being, and its a shame that wasnt the case. If you are looking for something that is different from the rest of the shows out there, this show is not for you. If you are looking for a show to waste some time, then by all means go ahead and give this anime a try.

    Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is pretty much your basic &amp;quot;harem anime, &amp;quot; and I have to say that it stays pretty tried and true with its formula.<br />
<br />
It starts off with Junichi (main male lead) meeting this mysterious rich female transfer student (Yuuhi) who has been forced to marry him by her dad. This happens early on and you would expect the rest of the anime to have them slowly grow close to each other, but oddly enough it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do that, even though they are the main couple of the title. For most of the anime it seems to have Junichi and his friends

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10778">
        simply messing around having fun, from having parties on a boat, to school festivals and the like. Now I realize that with a title that has &amp;quot;slice of life&amp;quot; elements to it, this would be a standard formula for them to use. The only problem is they tended to stick so much to the gang just having fun, that I honestly forgot that Junichi and Yuuhi were even suppose to get together. There is even talk at the beginning that Junichi has some weird alternate personality to him, (which he does) and at that point I was expecting it to play some sort of key role in things, but again it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do that. In fact from what I remember counting, he only shows it about 3 times during the series. And even at the end of the anime I am not quite sure just what kind of &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; role it played in things, as it seems they could have removed it completely from the story and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mattered. Now things do start to pick up &amp;quot;romance wise&amp;quot; in the title, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen until around the last three episodes. When I say that this is a harem title that is a bit of a stretch, because out of the nine girls only three actually like him, and one of them it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really even go past words. Now I have to give credit to them on the ending, I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting it to end the way it did when I first started watching this, and it sure was a different kind than most viewers will be expecting too. Plus it actual does conclude and he ends up together with one of the girls, so that&amp;rsquo;s a big plus. So you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about investing your time in this only for it to end without any kind of resolve. Even though this title does have some echhi-ness factors, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go too deep into it. You may see a casual panty shot about three times in it, but most of it comes in the form of cleavage shots, and even that isn&amp;rsquo;t really shown off too much. There is one episode where they visit a hot spring (or take a bath in general), but the steam censors it, at least the version I watched did. So anyway, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really focus on the romance for a good portion of the show, you kind of have to take the enjoyment on an &amp;quot;episode by episode&amp;quot; case. There is some decent humor in this, but I don&#039;t think it will be enough to keep you into it. There is a small plot going on about what Junichi actually is, it can get interesting at times as more hints are given out as the story progresses...even if its not really well explained at the end.<br />
<br />
The animation was good in this, while nobody ever really moved around enough to get a true judging on the whole &amp;quot;fluidity&amp;quot; aspects of it, the characters did come off with a certain charm to them. And I have to say that some of the hairstyles on the women were kind of bizarre--yet oddly charming. You get a lot of sunset scene here and it looks good enough to at least make you take notice of it. But the character design is probably the best thing regarding the art, while they weren&amp;rsquo;t really drawn highly detailed, they did have appealing qualities such as (again) the hairstyles, expressions, and the clothing that they wear. The backgrounds never really stand out though, they are not drawn badly by any means, but not detailed enough to really take notice of them. Which in turn could be either a good or bad thing, because it makes you stay focused on the characters themselves.<br />
<br />
The opening and closing theme were pretty nice, they both contained a bit of a happy--yet sincerity style to them. For some reason the opening makes me kind of sad, not because its bad, but just the way the music is displayed. Now I have to talk about my favorite aspect of this anime, and that was the voice acting! I won&amp;rsquo;t go as far to say that it was spectacular or anything, but I did feel that each characters voice matched beautifully with the characters. Especially with a female named Minato, she had that kind of &amp;quot;nice girl&amp;quot; personality to her, and her voice actress complimented that very well for her. Nothing really worth mentioning about the background tracks, nothing there is particularly memorable, in fact even now I can&amp;rsquo;t really remember much of it.<br />
<br />
There are over twelve characters in this anime, but unfortunately you only get actual character development with three of them. Even to this day I am still unsure as to who some of the supporting cast members actually were, due to the fact that some would only show up every now and then as the story progressed. Nobody should ever really come off as annoying to the audience, though some people may be turned off with Junichi. Because despite his whole &amp;quot;double personality&amp;quot; ordeal, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have much of an impacting persona, and seems to just kind of, well...be there.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst of the harem titles out there, it really isn&amp;rsquo;t even a bad anime in general, the story is what really brings this title down. Though I did end up finishing this, only because I don&#039;t like to drop something when I am well into it already. (again you can&#039;t anticipate any of the overall story since it doesn&#039;t really build much up, you just have to enjoy each episode as it happens if at all possible) If you&amp;rsquo;re a hardcore harem fan and want something that is unique to the genera, then you probably should just look elsewhere, because this one is pretty standard fare. But if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to maybe get into the genera, or are willing to go in with lower expectations, then I think you should be fine.<br />

&amp;quot;Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka&amp;quot; gets 5 censored bath scenes, out of 10!

    I only write reviews which defend animes thats been UNDERATED like this one.<br />
I have no idea why people are mocking this anime, there is nothing wrong with this anime.<br />
The storyline follows the classic romance comedy, face it people, pretty much All romance comedies containing harems follow pretty much the same storyline, in fact this anime was actually more difficult to predict than standard romance comedies. I actually predicted the ending wrong which very very rarely happens.<br />
<br />
I see in some reviews people mentioned that this anime was Cliche. I don&#039;t know how many romance comedies you&#039;ve seen but to call this anime &amp;quot;Cliche&amp;quot; you obviously haven&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review11857">
        seen many romance comedies. I&#039;ve seen over 80 and I will tell you compared to most other romance comedies this anime is far Less Cliche.<br />
<br />
This anime is suppose to be a fun anime to watch thats enjoyable and easy on the emotions, if you are looking for epic romance or plot/storyline based animes then you should probably go watch shojo animes or rl serieses.<br />
<br />
Art work, outstanding, amazing, 10/10 would like to give 11/10 if possible.<br />
Ending is resolved unlike ichigo 100% which has a total crap ending.<br />
Some very funny parts. <br />
<br />
Storyline follows the typical romance comedy with Some original ideas. ---&amp;gt; 7/10<br />
<br />
Characters, very little flashbacks and all the characters could be developed better by revealing more about their lives however, this is suppose to be a fun anime to watch and they are such lovable characters (Mainly because graphics are so good) so I can overlook the negative points.  ---&amp;gt; 7/10<br />
<br />
Graphics, couldn&#039;t ask for better. Smooth render, not pixelated at all. Very good use of colours and all girls/guys are bishojo/shounen (Eye candy so to speak) well illustrated and drawing of each character reflect their personalities perfectly. ---&amp;gt; 10/10<br />
<br />
Sound. Well just look at the cast and you will find all the voices you like in this anime. Opening is nice and it seems that this anime has a different song for each ending which is unique. ---&amp;gt; 10/10<br />
<br />
Averages out to 8-9/10, anything lower than a 7 would mean you don&#039;t like romance comedies since most are worse off than this one.

    *Contains major spoilers<br />
<br />
First time I get to see a VN based anime, so I didn&#039;t know exactly what to expect from it, also because the game is an eroge... I guess it was good enough afterall, but all this fixation about &quot;imouto fantasies&quot; and incest, that japanese have, is really weird... I think it&#039;s ok this time, because everything got explained in the end...<br />
<br />
{STORY - 5/10}<br />
<br />
Jun&#039;ichi was a real badass on Junior High and even got the &quot;Geno Killer&quot; nickname. Despite not fighting anymore, he was able to save Yuhii on the first episode without lifting a finger, people were affraid... She got transferred to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review118845">
        the same school next day and, soon enough, a relationship would be born between those two.<br />
<br />
Thanks to an unexpected act from Jun&#039;ichi, Yuhii begins to hate him. However, living under the same roof would boost their connection and improve their relationship. Like any other tsundere character, Yuhii slowly starts to show her feelings, as she gets closer to Jun&#039;ichi. Problem is that his sister, Minato, would play this game too later on.<br />
<br />
Sidestory from Jun&#039;ichi&#039;s parents isn&#039;t an essential part, but pieces from it are featured on every episode, since they&#039;re key characters for this plot. His second encounter with Yuhii was something decided between both Katagiri and Nagase families, so they&#039;re important.<br />
<br />
{ART - 4/10}<br />
<br />
Nothing really special about it. Actually, is pretty basic and dull, since it isn&#039;t filled with action nor features great battles and everything. Like most VNs, eyed are bigger than usual and clothing styles are very common. Overally, basic.<br />
<br />
{SOUND - 3/10}<br />
<br />
OP song is cheering, but is also annoying. There are several ED songs, with just one main theme. Most of them are better than the intro&#039;s one and they share the same genre.<br />
<br />
{CHARACTERS - 4/10}<br />
<br />
We have Jun&#039;ichi as main male protagonist, that suffers from an identity crysis and is very indecise, unable to choose what he really wants. He may look strong willed, but that&#039;s just a cover to his fear of being alone. Minato is sweet and always smiling. She hides her real affection from Jun&#039;ichi because they&#039;re siblings. Yuhii is the typical tsundere, nervous and cold, still, able to show deep love after some time. Her hatred for Jun&#039;ichi decreases as he gets serious about their relationship.<br />
<br />
Other characters include weird Nagomi, who hides a dark scheme under her sleeve, and both Fuyuhiko and Sugishita, that seem to like Jun&#039;ichi more than usual. Actually, that&#039;s just a way to provocate him...<br />
<br />
{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a pretty funny anime actually. Nothing amazing about it, but I was able to have a good time, and that&#039;s all that matters to me. Maximum enjoyment!<br />
<br />
{OVERALL - 4/10}<br />
<br />
Choosing between two girls, one of them being your little sister. Jun&#039;ichi has to act like a man and say what he really feels, despite all the negative circunstances. Will he run away from destiny his entire life? Or take a mature decision and be with the person he loves?

    Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka has potential, but fails to deliver it throughout the episodes. The first episode sets up the story, and it is certainly interesting. However, unfortunately from there, it goes downhill. From a great introduction, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka then becomes dully episodic, and most of episodes have little to do with with the actual story. The plot is really only addressed in the last 2 episodes, which, I have to admit, does do a decent job in wrapping everything up.<br />
<br />
The characters are unique, but their development throughout the anime is pretty bland.You can just expect how each character would act in any

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10932">
        given situation. Yuuhi is the obvious tsundere would would always deny her true feelings and make it obvious that she&#039;s doing it. She almost does this in every single situation... It&#039;s interesting to watch her in action the first few times, but afterward, something new is needed, but never comes around.<br />
<br />
Sound and art are decent. Nothing bad, but doesn&#039;t deliver anything amazing or new either.<br />
<br />
The comedy is decent, but good scenes that really makes you laugh out loud are rare and infrequent.<br />
<br />
Overall, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka had potential, but the anime in its entirety does not meet up to expectations it sets in the beginning. I suggest this only if you&#039;ve ran out of other things to watch.

    WARNING: THIS CONTAINS MY OPINION AND A SPOILER!<br />
This anime might be the most boring anime I&#039;ve seen. And the worst ending I&#039;ve seen. From episode 1-9, it was decent. nothing really happened, and I was sure this anime wasn&#039;t going to be anything special. At episode 10 I changed my mind from: &quot;meh nothing special&quot; to: &quot;wow! this might actually be a good anime after all&quot;. I thought that it might have a good ending after all, but turns out I was wrong. After watching episode 11, I was sure there was no way out of this mess. There was no way this could have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review26935">
        a good ending, or maybe a decent one. And I were right, I watched episode 12 found out that episode 3-12 doesn&#039;t even have to be there. Because the relationship between boy, sister and girl in episode 2 is same as the ending of episode 12. its hard to explain. But what I want to say is that if you haven&#039;t watched this anime yet, you can just skip episode 3-9. the story doesn&#039;t change. <br />
Even though it had  good soundtracks, famous voice actors and good character desing, it wasn&#039;t as enjoyable as it should have been. the story ruined everything lol.<br />
THANK YOU FOR READING THIS CRAPPY &quot;REVIEW&quot;.<br />
oh and btw this isn&#039;t a review, its just me writing shit while sleeping.

    Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka at first seems like a cliche romance and all. Accidentally meeting in an awkward way and ending up together. Thle story would&#039;ve fit like that especially since the two main protagonists were giving hints of their feelings for each other. but that wasn&#039;t the case, it didn&#039;t happen. <br />
<br />
I gave the story a 5/10 because I personally hated how the story ended. I wanted it to be a bit more cliched cos if it was it would have been more fun to enjoy since you get those butterflies in the end when you see that the two main characters end up

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29452">
        together.<br />
<br />
The art was good, i gave it a 9.<br />
<br />
The sound was okay, i have no comment. I gave it a 6.<br />
<br />
Characters were a bit confusing but then later on easy to get, I gave it a 7.<br />
<br />
Overall it wasn&#039;t a bad anime, I was just really disappointed with the ending.<br />
<br />
but if you like romances with a bit of twists in them then you should totally try watching this but if you&#039;re more into cliche kind of romances, the romances that will make you moe since you guessed the ending right and you get butterflies in your stomach.. it may not be a good idea to watch this &gt;&lt; <br />

    “Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka” is one of those Anime that draws you in with the first episode. At the beginning of the series, you end up forming high expectations of the Anime because it in the long run is different from the cliché, only to have these expectations dashed at the end of the Anime because the storyline just couldn&#039;t hold itself together. Because of this, it is going to be very hard to leave out spoilers in my review.<br />
<br />
The Anime starts off with the protagonist finding out that he has a fiance and the two of them living together. This particular plot device is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46107">
        actually used in quite a few Anime, which makes it a cliché. While this cliché tends to come across poorly, what drew me into this particular storyline, was the fact that this seemed like a fresh side to the cliché that was actually for once fleshed out. I found myself rooting for Jun&#039;ichi and Yuuhi to get together by the end.<br />
<br />
And that is exactly why the Anime is such a let down. Basically, “Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka” is based off one of those dating simulation games over in Japan that are so popular. Normally, when this kind of media is adapted to an Anime, the viewer will have a bunch of pairings to choose from to root for, because the feelings of a bunch of characters are actually obvious. This way, when a different pairing then what you were rooting for becomes canon at the end, you aren&#039;t disappointed.<br />
<br />
However, with this particular Anime, the viewer is hit good and hard through a good portion of the episodes with Jun&#039;ichi and Yuuhi. There are rather mild hints at other possible pairings, but the truth in the matter is, they are so very, very mild it isn&#039;t funny. They feel more like hints that could be misinterpreted as having a very different meaning. So, when the pairing between Jun&#039;ichi and Yuuhi doesn&#039;t occur at the end, it is just disappointing, not matter how much you like the beginning.<br />
<br />
The beautiful art work does make up for some of the plot failing, but the sound actually brings it down. Amongst the beautiful art work, I found myself wanting to slap my hands over my ears every time I heard Jun&#039;ichi and Yuuhi speak. I know that their voice actors are popular and some people will fawn over any of their work, but I&#039;ve heard both of them do better, or maybe the better word is, I&#039;ve heard their voices in roles better suited towards them.<br />
<br />
I actually liked the characters at the beginning of the show, only to find myself frustrated with them later on. Sure, they were built on stereotypes, but the way they interacted was funny. So much so, I enjoyed the interactions. However, later on, these interactions fell apart and/or became boring. A lot of the sub characters were shoved aside for the main three and their importance diminished to filler.<br />
<br />
As for my enjoyment, I honestly did like the beginning of the show. However, I was not happy with the ending, despite the fact it didn&#039;t come out of nowhere. I didn&#039;t really think of this as a harem Anime, until the end either, and then because of the ending, it became clear that this is a poorly done one. I think it is worth watching though, even if it is just once. That said... I do have an important warning that includes spoilers, but it is important for those who don&#039;t like this kind of show.<br />
<br />
WARNING: The person Jun&#039;ichi decides that he likes is his sister.

    I can&#039;t describe how blown away I was after watching this. This is not one of your typical harem animes. Yes indeed the plot has been totally overused, but the real plot is what makes it different from  all the other animes I&#039;ve seen.<br />
<br />
First of all let me say this:   This is not your typical comedy/harem anime like Love Hina or School Rumble. This to me is more drama/harem. There are funny moments  indeed,  but there is more emtional drama than comedy throughout the anime. The anime, to the average comic/harem lover will be kinda slow and with little or

          <span style="display: none;" id="review19306">
        no comedy. Reason being why many people gave it a very low score.  <br />
<br />
This is what I like to call a Serious  Harem Anime since the characters feelings ( (Junichi, Minato Katagiri) are all genuine and real and not the lovey dovey type like Rosario + Vampire. This is what totally blew me away and kept me on toes throughout the ending.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this anime ^_^ 11/10

    WARNING: This review contains spoilers and lots of swearing<br />
<br />
People say the journey is more important than the destination. However, after watching this tripe named Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka, I realized that isn&#039;t always the case. Nothing can compare to the amount of disappointment I got after finishing this series. This anime, although clichéd in a lot aspects, I actually thought was pretty passable. Well, that was until that asspull ending so big I think I ripped my anus.<br />
<br />
*STORY: 4/10<br />
Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka or Akasaka for short, is an anime produced by TNK based off a visual novel with the same name by Feng. The story

          <span style="display: none;" id="review195231">
        starts off with our main protagonist Nagase, Junichi saving a girl from being harrassed by men while on his way to school. Junichi later found out the girl he saved is the rich new transfer student Katagiri, Yuuhi. Yuuhi, at first, had a good opinion of Junichi but that changed when Junichi, because of his chuunibyo delusions, kissed Yuuhi out of nowhere. Now branded as a pervert, Yuuhi hates Junichi&#039;s guts. Much more to Yuuhi&#039;s disappointment, she discovered Junichi is actually her fiancé she transferred in to check up on. Yuuhi now decides to live with Junichi, together with Junichi&#039;s little sister Minato, to see if he really is worthy of being her bride. Thus the start of your typical romance harem.<br />
<br />
The story is nothing special. Right of the bat we are bombarded with anime clichés like arranged marriage, the transfer student and the mandatory &quot;accidental&quot; kiss. It is your standard harem storyline complete with harem/ecchi tropes you have probably seen hundreds of times. However, if I have something I&#039;ve learned from watching anime for years is that not all clichés are bad so I stuck with it. While Akasaka uses a lot of trite jokes mostly in the form of fanservice and side plots I couldn&#039;t care less about, there&#039;s still some enjoyment to be had in this anime. There was a point where I actually wondered why the rating was so low when it&#039;s not really that bad. The progression of the story is very slow, but the cute budding romance between our main couple, Junichi and Yuuhi, is enough to keep me watching. I genuinely got feels from this anime but sadly, everything was short-lived as they start to fuck up everything that was good about this anime.<br />
<br />
~SPOILERS STARTS HERE~<br />
<br />
I was in a pretty good mood when Junichi and Yuuhi finally became a couple in episode10 and shared a steamy kiss (unaware of the impending disappointment waiting for me). What happened next was an obvious attempt by the creators to be &quot;unique&quot;. <br />
<br />
Junichi started doubting his feelings for Yuuhi so he had a serious little chat with his best friend (at this point I&#039;m already filled with great trepidation) well you know what happened next. On the act of the imouto gods, Junichi realized he&#039;s actually in love with his little sister Minato. WHAT THE FLYING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!! And what&#039;s worst, Yuuhi is ok with it! Junichi confessed to Minato later, and it seems their feelings were mutual. The anime ends with Minato entering the bathroom to give Junichi a nice incestuous back scrub and later, Yuuhi also joined the bath saying she wouldn&#039;t just give up so easily blah blah. Ending credits.<br />
<br />
My buddha, the only saving grace of the anime turned out to be a bag full of dog shit. Mind you, I&#039;m not a fan of incest but that&#039;s not actually the main reason why I&#039;m ranting so much about the ending. On the scale of 1 to Yosuga no sora, this anime is about a 7. Well it was hinted (but never confirmed) that Junichi and Minato aren&#039;t blood-related. You know, the usual pseudo-incest anime pulls off? The incest is part of the reason too but the main reason I am not very happy about that ending is because the ending basically rendered 10 episodes of developing Junichi and Yuuhi&#039;s relationship ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS. It felt like a everything was a fucking waste of time. Junichi and Minato hardly had any romantic interaction through-out the show and we just found out later that they actually liked each other, like what the fuck?<br />
<br />
To be honest, I like Minato more as a character (not really as a love interest though) because Yuuhi is an annoying tsundere, but this is not how you end an anime. It&#039;s obvious the creators were trying to be different here, which isn&#039;t bad, it&#039;s just this time they failed VERY MISERABLY.<br />
<br />
~END OF SPOILERS~<br />
<br />
*CHARACTERS: 5/10<br />
Well there&#039;s nothing really much to say about the characters because they are very one-dimensional; aren&#039;t unique or special in any way at all. We have the usual violent tsundere, the caring little sister and of course Akasaka wouldn&#039;t be considered a harem without other girls crushing on the main protagonist for reasons we don&#039;t know.<br />
 <br />
The main protagonist Junichi, in my opinion, is probably the most likeable of the characters mainly because he&#039;s not your usual overly perverse romcom harem MC who blushes and have fatal nosebleeds on every sight of something titillating. MCs like him are more common in action harems and I must say I greatly prefer this type of MC. However, that is not nearly enough to make up for the lack of character development in almost all of the characters, and not to mention, the whole bunch of other unimportant characters added just for the sake of having more characters.<br />
<br />
*ART/ANIMATION: 6/10<br />
The first thing I&#039;ve notice was the character designs, more specifically the character&#039;s hairstyles that looked like it took them 10 cans of hairspray to shape it that way. They have some of the wildest hairstyles that I&#039;ve seen in anime that is not battleshounen. TNK doesn&#039;t really stand out when it comes to art quality, though their animation can be good sometimes. When you look at their other works, art and animation is average at best. Akasaka&#039;s art and animation quality is not that much different.<br />
<br />
*SOUND/MUSIC: 8/10<br />
When you have a cast of talented voice actors like Rie Kugimiya and Aya Hirano you can almost never go wrong with voice acting. And for Akasaka&#039;s opening and ending theme, well it&#039;s pretty okay but not really what I would consider memorable. <br />
<br />
*OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: 4/10<br />
Akasaka, while it had its good moments, was mediocre at best, but it just have to sink even lower by pulling off that stupid ending. Unless you have a thing for imoutos, you should just stay away from this anime and forget it even existed, because what awaits you is just great disappointment and possibly anal fissures.

Everyone talks about how terrible the story was, and how it raised expectations, but then didn&#039;t meet them even half way...but I honestly loved it! The characters, in my opinion, were VERY well done!!<br />
<br />
Story: Junichi, and Minato live together (Brother and sister), but there has always been a strange sexual attraction...Then Yuuhi comes to move in! Who is &#039;Yuuhi&#039;? She&#039;s the cute, tsundre who Junichi is going to marry! Wait--what? Yes, it is an arranged marriage. Minato and Yuuhi quickly become friends...but what about the strange attraction between Minato and Junichi? It doesn&#039;t fade away...<br />
<br />
Art:

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34599">
        The art was AWESOME! I didn&#039;t see the anime in high def, but the art was awesome. I&#039;m not a fan of &#039;fan-service&#039;, but there were little bits of it...Minato was my favorite character but her breasts were HUGE! What the heck?? There was also another character, (Can&#039;t remember her name, she wanted to voice act) who&#039;s breast were 5x the size of Minato&#039;s. Like I said, not into fan-service at all, but I was like &quot;O____O what the fluff&quot;...<br />
<br />
Sound: I liked the theme song, it was so catchy, and most certainly fit the anime! The voice actors were awesome!<br />
<br />
Character: I felt as though all the characters were very well developed!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:...every part of it...I loved!<br />
<br />

    This series is incredibly hard to interpret.<br />
Story: to start, the basic story is Junichi engaged to Yuuhi Katagiri, but Yuuhi refuses to acknowledge the engagement that her father has arranged and so she stays with Junichi before finalizing a decision...unfortunately, before moving in, she didn&#039;t have quite the pleasant experience meeting him...The first episode already was bland and it didn&#039;t really get interesting until we saw Junichi&#039;s sister, Minato, implicitly become Yuuhi&#039;s rival in Junichi&#039;s love.  That is where it got interesting...so there was a hint of incest relationship, which was a start for this series, but was eventually poorly executed.  Things are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10847">
        often resolved too quickly in the series as if by magic.  Making each following episode very unappealing to look forward to as the show would continue to shift focus.  Eventually  Minato is chosen by Junichi but it was far too rushed with too many unexplained pieces of the plot in the final episode.  One after the other new things came out like Junichi as a subject, File X, etc...none of which was actually revealed earlier on in the series except in dull comedic scenarios.  All in all there was a story but it was poorly paced and executed.  4/10<br />
<br />
Art: Very noticeable poor animation quality, especially in the last episode where characters laughing looked like a bunch of bobble heads and possibly much more throughout the series that I don&#039;t remember or even want to remember.  The artwork was only mediocre.  Even worse in the last episode during the whole subconscious scenario and &amp;quot;shadow of Junichi.&amp;quot;  3/10<br />
<br />
Sound: One of the only redeeming points of this series was its seiyuu cast.  What more could you possibly ask for than Aya Hirano, Rie Tanaka, Rie Kugimiya, and many more of the like all in one show?  Music, as expected was nicely done as a result.  7/10<br />
<br />
Character: If anything, there was no character development...at most we only got a bit of Junichi&#039;s past in the final episode.  Everyone else essentially played as side characters.  There was one episode with Tsukasa getting some nice plot development, but other than her, even Minato and Yuuhi who were the two lead female protagonists didn&#039;t get much background, and I won&#039;t get started on Karen, Mitsuki, and Nagomi. 3/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: This was suppose to be one of my highly anticipated shows this fall after being postponed from the horrendous summer 2008.  However, it clearly became one of the worse in fall 2008 and if anything one of the worst series in anime history for school-life romance series. 3/10<br />
<br />
Overall: This series was not good at all.  It had an amazing seiyuu cast and that was really about it.  I don&#039;t understand how anything could fail so hard with such an amazing cast.  If your old enough or simply daring enough, go play the ero-game...it&#039;s much more worth your time.  I only hope now the OVA will live up to its promise of a different story, let alone a much more compelling one.  This is not worth anyone&#039;s time watching despite the cast.  In a sense this show is like bad mouthing the seiyuus behind the scenes.  It had potential of being a satisfactory series around episode 9 or 10, but conflicts were simply rushed to be resolved leaving nothing really interesting for the final episode to work with much without having to rush the series to finish on a conclusive note... 4/10<br />

    Adaptations of harem based eroge have increased in frequency lately, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka (hereby referred to as &quot;Akasaka&quot;) is an example of one that has possibly been butchered due to some factors (using the seiyuu from the PS2 adaptations, the ending). Directed by Keitarou Motonaga, notorious for directing other harem anime (School Days, Onii-chan no Koto) and Katanagatari (a big surprise) Akasaka proves that it is a product of many trite, anime/eroge cliches that were mixed in a blender of sorts with hints of fanservice added as some sort of seasoning. Ah yes, the eroge itself was produced by feng around 1 year before

          <span style="display: none;" id="review49981">
        the anime adaptation as well.<br />
<br />
Either way, I shall get on with the reviewing now. This is also my first review that isn&#039;t a joke so the probability of me making mistakes is pretty high.<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
The main plot (which gets shoved out of the way within only 2 episodes, wow) is the stereotypical &quot;girl who has a bonus of being rich but she tries to make sure people don&#039;t know that ends up living with an ordinary high schooler who also turns out to be her fiancee, hilarity ensues&quot; one that is quite common amongst anime and eroge. The little differences are that the main heroine, Yuuhi Katagiri, turns out to be a tsundere (plus the &quot;ojou&quot; role is relegated to Karen Ayanokouji, someone who is only an add on heroine for the PS2 adaptation) and the Rie Kugimiya type too. The protagonist, Junichi Nagase, also probably fell for her at the beginning and as the series goes on he does build up his relationship with Yuuhi but it ultimately goes to waste in the end, for reasons that are possibly obvious and are what kind of add to the notoriety of the Akasaka adaptation. (Oops, spoiler.)<br />
<br />
When I mentioned in brackets that the plot does get shoved out of the way within only 2 episodes, it really does. The first 2 focus on Yuuhi meeting Junichi and making herself out to be a tsundere (since Junichi impulsively steals her first kiss, oh Junichi look at what you&#039;ve done you indecisive harem protagonist) and Yuuhi getting to know Junichi&#039;s little sister, Minato. We learn about how Yuuhi is a sheltered rich girl in the second, but then we end up watching the cast&#039;s harem shenanigans afterwards until the last few <br />
episodes. <br />
<br />
Oh yes, the classmates also decide to constantly remind Yuuhi and Junichi of the first kiss, to their dismay, and the dismay of the viewer since it gets irritating after the first few times. Episodes 3-10 are ultimately filler, even though some of them are dedicated to other not noteworthy cast members like the two childhood friends of Junichi, the main &quot;ojou&quot; (I think i&#039;ll say rich girl from now), the mysterious character whose motives aren&#039;t touched upon throughout the series, the school idol and student council president who is a trickster, the teacher who is childish and male and possibly others who will be described in the characters section. You could say they&#039;re there to develop the relationship but that could&#039;ve been done without all these wasted minutes.<br />

Actually, there were some things that were pretty cool (Junichi&#039;s parents, Nagomi&#039;s behaviour) but they were executed poorly and should&#039;ve been relegated to a different series altogether. Here they were seen as unnecessary and plot holes that are never given any more thought.<br />

The animation in Akasaka wasn&#039;t the worst, but it wasn&#039;t the best either. The animators possibly slacked off while working on the figures, as their faces were consistently off model at times (except for the last episode) when they were moving around and what not. The backgrounds were your standard fare for anime, not being really special in particular (although compared to others I haven&#039;t watched much so I might not be right in this area). The character designs were pretty fancy, mostly with the hairdos. The faces are cute, with the boy&#039;s faces making themselves look like they could qualify as successful crossdressers. Even though they weren&#039;t bad, they weren&#039;t entirely unique (Yuuhi&#039;s and Mitsuki&#039;s hairdos are pretty similar and if it weren&#039;t for Mitsuki&#039;s hat and different face they could&#039;ve been mistakened for each other) the somewhat different faces and colours of the hairdos were the only ways you could differentiate the others. Watching Akasaka with the designs felt like watching someone playthrough a dating sim with animated scenes all around.<br />

Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not much to say about the sound and music and whatnot, since the themes themselves were pretty forgettable and your standard J-pop fare. On the other hand, you can see that they used an all star seiyuu cast as replacements that would be used for the anime. With Rie Kugimiya (Yuuhi, of course), Aya Hirano (Minato), Wataru Hatano (Junichi), Akira Ishida (Fuyuhiko), Marina Inoue (Tsukasa)... anyone who wasn&#039;t a really minor character practically was voiced by a well-known seiyuu. (Aya is an exception as she was voiced by Kaori Fukuhara, and the Nagase mother since she was voiced by Atsuko Tanaka.) Sadly, their talent was put to waste and ended up being considered kind of annoying, especially Rie Kugimiya&#039;s tsundere spouting nonsense as Yuuhi. Some of the voices can get on the nerves of people, namely Minato&#039;s and Fuyuhiko&#039;s, maybe to mimic the original seiyuu? Who knows.<br />
<br />

<br />
Character: 2/10<br />
<br />
Ah, the part where you could easily frown at how badly they were handled. The characters in Akasaka were walking cliches, only having maybe one or two traits to separate them from the norm. The anime does try to make them look important and not flat; actually, that only goes for Junichi, but they fail.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ll be describing each of them, well at least from what I gathered from watching the anime.<br />
<br />
Junichi Nagase: Stereotypical harem protagonist who is living with an often praised little sister! Has two childhood friends, Fuyuhiko and Tsukasa, who like to trouble him a lot! Just like the student council president, Mitsuki Shiina, who uses him as some sort of lap dog of sorts since he&#039;s free! He also comes with the added traits of being somewhat idiotic when it comes to handling a tsundere, being untidy, really childish and having a back story that mainly gets focused on it during the last 2 episodes. Junichi comes off as manly and the only sane man in the first episode but he is then shown as a harem protagonist with a swimsuit fetish afterwards.<br />
<br />
He is also snarky but that&#039;s because he gets treated like shit a lot by his friends. He goes through minor character development that maybe shouldn&#039;t qualify as character development. At the end he&#039;s revealed to have Chuuni syndrome (eternal manchild syndrome), something never mentioned anywhere else. It comes off as a weak excuse to add weak character development that you would only notice by him stating what happened. Indecisive as hell.<br />
<br />
Yuuhi Katagiri: Token tsundere heroine who gets the bonus of being voiced by Rie Kugimiya and is also short and flatchested compared to the others. Also a rich girl who gets engaged to Junichi but shows her tsun side when he unexpectedly steals her first kiss and ends up using his first kiss too. Compared to other tsunderes, Yuuhi isn&#039;t as likable. She isn&#039;t as bad as, say, Naru from Love Hina or Louise from Zero no Tsukaima but she comes off as an incredibly shallow one who blames Junichi for most things. She also can&#039;t cook when she isn&#039;t being supervised and requires master chef Minato to help her. She seems to be knowledgeable about flowers and types of tea and teacups due to her upbringing as a rich girl too.<br />
<br />
Minato Nagase: Disgustingly sweet little sister demi-heroine who is possibly related to Junichi. Practically perfect, since she&#039;s great at household chores and is used to living in the jungle, she gets praised a lot by the other characters. Minato could be considered a Mary Sue because of her really friendly nature and plus she gets a good amount of attention in the episodes from the writing staff and the characters. Minato seems to be a bit of a brocon, as she knows a lot of things about Junichi to an extent that can be considered stalker behaviour if it weren&#039;t for the fact that she&#039;s his sister. She&#039;s the perfect girl of the dating sim in a little sister persona, but we actually never get told whether she does well academically. She&#039;s also in the tennis club.<br />
<br />
Tsukasa Kiryuu: Childhood friend character who is one of the haremettes but you only get mild hints with a noticeable one in her spotlight episode, Tsukasa is a lively girl who is often seen with Fuyuhiko (as they apparently have the same personalities with some differences) who is in the Newspaper Club. Because she&#039;s in the newspaper club, this means that she&#039;s automatically a gossip. At times it is shown that she cares more about Junichi and the others, even moreso than Fuyuhiko. Apparently she wanted to be a seiyuu when she was younger because of a magical girl anime she watched with Junichi, and this is what her episode is all about.<br />
<br />
Fuyuhiko Nishino: &quot;Bromantic foil&quot; character who surprisingly doesn&#039;t show much interest in persuing the girls. Practically has Tsukasa&#039;s character traits except he&#039;s an otaku of sorts who has the ability to talk to Junichi when he&#039;s going through brain revelations. He&#039;s shown at the end to be a decisive character who helps Junichi go through character development, so he&#039;s possibly genre savvy without constantly pointing it out. Also the vice president of the student council, but that&#039;s only seen twice.<br />
<br />
Mitsuki Shiina: Student council president and school idol Amitie with an accent, Mitsuki is a trickster of sorts who isn&#039;t very good at keeping secrets (or is just a pest). Enjoys using Junichi as a lapdog and likes him but it&#039;s very easy to assume that she doesn&#039;t. There&#039;s not much to say about her, what a shame. Also a haremette.<br />
<br />
Nagomi Shiraishi: ~Mysterious~ girl who acts like a dandere. Hinted to be an alien since she talks to some sort of unknown entity who wanted her to observe Junichi or something. A poorly executed character who is there to fulfill the fantasies of those who think that Yuuhi&#039;s breasts are too big, and she&#039;s also got a sister called Yutori. Also a haremette.<br />
<br />
Karen Ayanokouji: Rich girl character who tries too hard when it comes to pleasing people. Gracefully hot blooded and (assuming these jokes were hers) can&#039;t tell jokes. Competitive with people who are well-liked or something, wasn&#039;t on the best terms with Yuuhi at the beginning but they eventually become sleepover buddies or something. Also a haremette.<br />
<br />
Mikoto Tachibana: Senpai character who hangs around Mitsuki. Plays tennis too? I dunno, she&#039;s fanservice space with little screen time. Also a haremette.<br />
<br />
Seijirou Sugishita: Playful teacher who&#039;s possibly gay for Junichi and gets into a only mentioned once rivalry with Fuyuhiko for the homo subtext with the protagonist space. He&#039;s a genderbent version of the unreliable teacher, and he also helps Junichi go through character development. He&#039;s poor.<br />
<br />
Aya Nijou: Secretary and Treasurer of the student council. Shown to be blunt and considerably normal amongst the standards in this series. Not a haremette!<br />
<br />
Nagase parents: Adventurous! Also, the mother is practically Fujiko Mine except nicer.<br />
<br />
So there you have it. Cliche, cliche and cliche.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 4/10<br />
<br />
Yes, despite all of the flaws I pointed out needlessly in this review, I didn&#039;t really mind watching it. Sure it&#039;s bland and cliched, but there were not many really really horrible bits aside from the ending. Also, it averted some of the cliches that it used too (no hot spring peeking) so it wasn&#039;t entirely facepalm worthy? I don&#039;t really have much to say for this part, surprisingly enough. All the characters are unlikeable though.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Overall, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is an anime that achieves nothing in trying to be spectacular within its genre and was practically made to be fapping material (or what I said at the beginning). Others might like it, but I can say that it didn&#039;t tickle my fancy. I&#039;m sure the original vn was hopefully better, and that the anime was just fucked up like most of eroge adaptations, so maybe this was just promotional material instead? The ending being like that so the angry people can just play the vn and experience the so-called true ending? Maybe.
