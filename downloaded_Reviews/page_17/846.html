The problem with movies is that all too often they&#039;re lacking in one or two fundamental areas, and unfortunately these are normally the plot or the characters. The first installment of this series suffered from the latter, and while it was still enjoyable even with that flaw, there was always the nagging feeling that something wasn&#039;t quite right.<br />
<br />
Thankfully this episode begins to address that issue.<br />
<br />
The second installment in the Kara no Kyoukai ~The Garden of Sinners~ franchise, Satsujin Kosatsu (Murder Speculation), is actually part one of a two part story arc (viewers will have to wait for the seventh movie

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12073">
        to see the conclusion of this episode), yet while this small irony is amusing, the are some flaws with this episode which one can only hope will be rectified with the final movie.<br />
<br />
This time around the story takes place over two years prior to the events in the first movie, and thankfully the main theme is the developing relationship between Ryougi Shiki and Kokuto Mikiya during their time together as high school students. Kokuto finds himself strangely attracted to the seemingly aloof Shiki, and proceeds to befriend her until a bizarre series of murders takes place.<br />
<br />
Now the nice thing about Satsujin Kousatsu Part 1 is that the plot takes a far more measured approach than Fukan Fuukei does, and while the pace picks up towards the end, there&#039;s something here that was somewhat missing from the previous installment - a sense of purpose.<br />
<br />
While the first episode was entertaining, there was a certain aimless quality about it due to the underdeveloped characters that permeated the quieter moments. This movie begins to shed some light on the actions of both Shiki and Kokuto during that time, especially on certain aspects of her behaviour and personality.<br />
<br />
The story is generally much quieter in tone than before, which may not sit too well with those who liked the frenetic action of Fukan Fuukei. This is a necessity as the anime of Satsujin Kousatsu Part 1 is to offer the viewer some perspective on every other movie in the franchise, and the clarity it provides may force viewers to reassess their opinion of the first installment.<br />
<br />
Once again Ufotable produce the goods with regards to artwork and animation. The character movements are excellent, and the incorporation of CG is almost seamless in respect of the backgrounds and backdrops. There are fewer action sequences this time around, but they are just as good here as they are in the first movie, especially when it comes to choreography and use of environment. As for the the character designs, they&#039;re a little different in that both Kokuto and Shiki have a certain youthful quality about them, which is reflective of the fact that this story takes place two years before the first movie.<br />
<br />
Sound is, again, extremely good overall, and the movie uses the various effects well, however there are some issues as there are occasions where the various noises clash to create a veritable cacophony. This doesn&#039;t really detract from the movie though and, surprisingly, actually improves certain sequences.<br />
<br />
The music throughout the movie is generally utilised to good effect, often enhancing the atmosphere in a particular scene. The voice actors are also very good, and are able to show some real talent with regards to their respective characters, however given that this is the second movie in a series of seven, this should come as no surprise. What is surprising though, is that the lead seiyuu are able to instill their respective characters with a degree of naivety and innocence, something which improves the overall effect of the movie no end.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that&#039;s not enough to raise the characters from their stupor.<br />
<br />
While there is very clearly some development occurring over the course of the movie, one of the issues that seems destined to repeat throughout the franchise is that the plot doesn&#039;t give them enough time for this growth to set as part of their persona, and that leads once more to an imbalance in the storyline. The revelation about Shiki&#039;s personality goes some way to explaining why she is the way she is, but Kokuto is the real problem. As a character he is simply bland, and at no point does the movie go into any detail about his goals, thoughts, ideals, etc. Everything in the movie actually revolves around Shiki, including Kokuto, and all of his actions stem from that one driving principle. Unfortunately this feels like a missed opportunity to add some real meat to both the leads, but it may be that all of these concerns will be addressed by the time the series ends.<br />
<br />
The other problem was the lack of Aozaki Touko. It would have been a nice addition to have more information on her from that time period as she is one of the mysteries of Kara no Kyoukai, and in all honesty this could have been done simply and easily. Sadly, the fact that she has not been included in this movie means that it has a slightly disjointed feel compared to the first, but again this may be rectified with the second half of this story arc.<br />
<br />
We shall see...<br />
<br />
Even with those flaws this is still an enjoyable movie, and it&#039;s nice to finally see how the two leads met and got to know each other. It would have been nice if the plot wasn&#039;t focused so much on Shiki as this would have allowed for some introspection of the part of Kokuto. On the plus side, the slower pacing of this speisode actually adds to the tension this time around, but like the first movie the plot continues to retain a degree of predictability.<br />
<br />
Fans of Fukan Fuukei will be pleased at this second offering as it is very much in keeping with the spirit of the series, however I would advise against making snap judgements about the whole franchise simply on the basis of this or the first movie.<br />
<br />
As before, I look forward to the next episode.<br />
<br />

    Kara no Kyoukai 2 exceeds the first movie in almost every aspect. There is depth to Shiki that was absent before, new settings are introduced to a much more comprehensible degree, the supporting cast are more prominent and the writers - instead of being cryptic - present a largely compelling and well developed story, solidifying the series&#039; true roots.<br />
<br />
The first installment threw audiences into a mystery unfortunately dulled by the lack of depth to the characters, but the second installment lays down the groundwork, exploring the origins of Shiki and Mikiya. The story is well executed and - unlike in the first film - has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12134">
        a real sense of purpose, progression and development. It&#039;s a compelling origins story, where Shiki and Mikiya&#039;s relationship is genuinely captivating to watch unravel (especially given the eerie undertones); much more befitting as an introduction to the septenary.<br />
<br />
The film chiefly explores Shiki and Mikiya alone, with little room for anyone else in the run-time, but the film still feels a lot more &#039;alive&#039; than the first installment. The supporting cast are more pronounced, with the locations well explored; there&#039;s a better sense of the setting than before. Of the two main characters, Shiki is particularly well developed, we see her many sides and for the first time get a real understanding of who she is. Mikiya, on the other hand, comes across as rather dull and more a vessel to further explore Shiki than an important presence himself.<br />
<br />
As in the first installment, the animation and art style remain consistently strong, though with more dialogue-heavy sequences this time around, it is perhaps not as dynamic. Nevertheless, the art is crisp and detailed - Shiki&#039;s eyes are ever-beautiful, as are the locations - with the staff exquisitely animating a number of terrific dramatic scenes. The visuals are impressive, though the cinematography could have been more absorbing, with certain shots becoming a little banal.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s no stunning insert song this time around (though Mikiya hums Singin&#039; in the Rain which is a nice little nod to a classic), but the background music is ever prominent. There are a number of immersive tracks that blend well with the visuals - ultimately creating some very coherent, well put together and atmospheric sequences - with the more uptempo tracks complementing the action sequences well.<br />
<br />
Kara no Kyoukai 2 isn&#039;t a masterpiece, but it&#039;s a huge improvement over the first installment. It&#039;s a well constructed origins story with a lot of depth and promise, offering the series its groundwork. Here&#039;s hoping the septenary continues to climb.

    This is part 2 of the KnK series<br />
This is a sequel to the 1st KnK......kind of....Well, not exactly. You see, KnK is not being shown in chronological order and as such should not be watched in chronological order. I almost made a grave mistake of doing so. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Story]: (8/10)<br />
The story of KnK 2 takes place 3 years before the events of KnK 1. <br />
Mikiya, while walking home from school, meets a mysterious girl who he thinks is cute and starts falling in love with her. A month later, he met her again during the high school entrance ceremony. The mysterious girl that he met is

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196468">
        named Shiki Ryougi. Meanwhile, the city is experiencing a series of bizarre murders but no suspect has been caught yet. <br />
The events may have taken place before the events of the first KnK but the movie shows us how the 2 characters met and why there&#039;s a connection between them. It&#039;s starting to connect some of the dots but there&#039;s still obviously a lot of unanswered questions that will be answered later on in the movies. So far, I&#039;m liking the story. The gruesome murders, the mystery around it, etc. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Art/Animation]: (10/10)<br />
Do I need to review the animation? I mean, it&#039;s still the KnK series and nothing really changed from the first one which is already perfect and visually stunning.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Sound]: (9.5/10)<br />
The soundtrack was perfect in the first movie but somehow, the soundtrack here is.......inferior to the first one. Granted, there are some themes that are great but it didn&#039;t quite stand out like the first one did. The voice actors are all the same so my opinions on the VA still stands.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Character]: (8/10)<br />
The first movie didn&#039;t really give us any great details about the 2 main characters and why I should really care for them. The 2nd movie showed us the main character&#039;s past, how they met, what connections do they have, what they were like back in high school, etc. The movie is now developing the characters (not too developed yet) and they&#039;re giving me a few reasons on why I should give a crap about them. I&#039;m also starting to understand more about Shiki and her &quot;dual personality&quot; and why Mikiya cares for Shiki. In short, the movie just showed us a hour of character development for the 2 main characters. <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Enjoyment]: (8/10)<br />
I personally enjoyed the movie because of the character development and story development. There&#039;s not a lot of action for this movie since all they did was build up and develop the characters<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)<br />
The second movie of the KnK series is not better than the first movie but it&#039;s not worse either. It gave us more in-sight about the characters. The movie just created more plot holes for me but there&#039;s 5 movies to go so I&#039;m not going to complain that much. <br />
For the love of god, if you&#039;re watching KnK 2 first because you&#039;re watching it in chronological order then don&#039;t. The KnK series is meant to be shown out of chronological order and should be watched out of chronological order.

    Well here we have it, this is the second movie of seven in this series in which I also mentioned in my review for Kara no Kyoukai: Fukan Fuukei. And as I have mentioned in my other review as well this movie is based on the  Japanese novel series, authored by Kinoko Nasu and illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi. I should also state, if you havent noticed in the title, that this movie is actually the first half of 2 parts. <br />
<br />
Well anyway onto the review. <br />
<br />
Warning: Their are spoilers within this review, so please watch the movie first if you don&#039;t wish to be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6169">
        spoiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story - 8<br />
Well first off the story in the second movie, is abit more smooth than the first one. It introduces how Shiki Ryōgi and Mikiya Kokutō first met back in high school, so this answers some questions from the first movie, but not all. The story itself in this one is still abit shaky but not as rough in the first one.<br />
<br />
Art - 10<br />
Just like the first movie, this one too shines in this category. The visuals is just excellent movie which is something only a handful of other animes can surpass or match. The lighting was just done great in the night scenes and the murders scenes done so explicit that it seems real itself. Once again, excellent.<br />
<br />
Sound - 8<br />
Well I didn&#039;t see quite an improvement nor a downgrade in sound here. The bgm still mixed perfectly well with some scenes. Although I did like the theme song for this one, which was also  performed by Yuki Kajiura.<br />
<br />
Character - 8<br />
Well just like the first one, the second well still suffers in this category, but not as much as the first. Unlike the first one which was kinda thrown at our face, this one introduces alittle abit of character behind Shiki Ryōgi and Mikiya Kokutō. Its notable that Mikiya had interest in Shiki since he first laid eyes on her, and that Shiki is from a prestigous background. So were treated to not development but more background for these two. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 8<br />
Well if you enjoyed the first one, then you might be alittle disappointed on this one, or not. All I can say is that their is less(or no, whatever you criteria of action is) action in this one compared to the first one. Pretty much the only way to enjoy this movie is that you get at least abit of background story behind two characters. But you do get a sense of suspense when you do learn more background of these characters, which may shock you or not. And like the first, murder scenes are still quite explicit.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8<br />
Overall the movie, from a Type-Moon fans opinion or if you generally like the series, is great. Because you get more background story for characters. The visuals is still excellent as always, with the sound being good. Still has its noticeable flaws but still a great movie of the supernatural. Although the average anime viewer might be turned away by this movie, more so than the first movie if they havent even watched the first movie. So its recommended to watch the first movie Kara no Kyoukai: Fukan Fuukei first before this one.<br />
<br />
Now if you look at this movie and the first one, then you might wonder: How come this movie wasn&#039;t first and the first movie later? Well the movies themselves, as ive mentioned before, are based on the light novels from where it originated. And how the light novels where set-up was that the <br />
chapter listings timeselves are not in chronological order. So the movies being released are staying true to the original light novels listing hence is the reason why the movies are set-up like that. Like I mentioned earlier, this movie is part 1 of 2, in which if the movies stay true to the light novels, then the part 2 of this one won&#039;t be shown until the seventh movie which is also the last one.<br />
<br />
As I have said recommended if you have seen the first movie first for the average anime viewer, and you should watch if your a TYPE-moon fan.

    [B]Intro<br />
Ok having have the hell confused out of my brain, In my opinion this series totally redeemed itself and brought a fantastic come back with number 2 in the series. Here it goes...<br />
<br />
Story<br />
The story was great and has a nice but unexpected link with the first movie which was the murder mysteries. This episode also explained more about the characters and even answered questions that confused me in the first installment. Looking at it from a periodical point of view this episode SHOULD have been before the first movie to avoid confusiion but having watch the next few episodes maybe there will be a reason

          <span style="display: none;" id="review9079">
        why. 9 out of 10 for story I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to put this at the same mark as my favourite anime. But it&#039;s still great, 8 would be way too low =]<br />
<br />
Art<br />
The art was just as good as the first and just as bloody. I enjoyed looking at the art in this one alot more too because i was rattling my brain with questions that was never answered.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
The music as with the first installment went really well and made this so much mor enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
AH! The redemption of confusing that the first installment gave...characters we&#039;re pretty much explained and it doesnt only talk about the characters pasts, it takes us back to witness it in a full hour episode by jumping back in the episode timeline! Which i think it a great addition, but hey it worked with star wars, why not here?<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
This is a really good anime so far. At first episode confusing then a HUGE redemption. I hope this to get even better and I think i will probabaly watch this series again sometime if it stays as good as this episode was. And if it gets better hey! Might even find some of the episodes up with my favourite anime! Although I only rated this an 8 it&#039;s still growing on me from the prequels failure to satisfy my anime requirements, lol!<br />
<br />
ENJOY! worth the watch!

    Hello everyone and welcome to my first film review week. Why am I doing this? Because I&#039;ve got five different anime films I&#039;ve agreed to review so I figured it would be more efficient to find two more and take care of them all in a week than it would be to just stretch them out over the course of five. Many of you probably remember that a couple weeks ago I reviewed the first Kara no Kyoukai movie and it was not a well written movie at all. It had some good production values, but nothing of substance. So, why am I watching another

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92825">
        one after that? Well, when I posted the review on MAL I got several responses from fans of the franchise. Surprisingly, they were polite, grammatically correct and respectful. No one said that my opinion was wrong (because opinions totally work on a right or wrong basis), accused me of not getting it or referred to me as any type of slur for daring to disagree with them. The basic gist of the messages was something like this &quot;I understand why you didn&#039;t like the first movie, but I think you should give the series more of a chance. I think you&#039;ll find that it gets a lot better.&quot; After getting those messages I thought that if they were indicative of the quality of the fan base as a whole I wanted to give the franchise more of a chance. So I ended up agreeing to watch two more movies. If I don&#039;t like them I&#039;ll respectfully disagree with the fans and politely pass on the rest. If I do like them, I&#039;ll watch the other four. Although I haven&#039;t decided whether I&#039;ll give them full reviews or not yet. Fair enough? Good. Now that that&#039;s out of the way let&#039;s take a look at Kara no Kyoukai 2 Satsujin Kosatsu (zen) which I will simply refer to as KnK 2 from this point on. <br />
<br />
KnK 2 has a pretty simple plot. In this one Mikiya and Shiki are students just starting to develop a friendly relationship. Meanwhile, there&#039;s a serial killer on the loose and Shiki is hiding a secret. The story starts by slowly introducing all of these elements, giving subtle clues and eventually brings them all together. Unlike the first KnK, which was just painfully slow, the atmosphere in this one is built very effectively. It&#039;s still a bit slow, but it isn&#039;t nearly the issue it was in the first film. The ending is left a little open, but it works pretty well. The only real story issue is that they have a clearly flawed understanding of psychology which comes up when Mikiya learns Shiki&#039;s secret. I&#039;m not sure whether to just let it go and call it a supernatural element or point out that the disorder they&#039;re using doesn&#039;t work the way they think it does. <br />
<br />
The main reason that KnK 2 manages to be effective in spite of the slow pace is the characters. In this one they actually develop Mikiya and Shiki as characters. The film spends a lot of time with both of them individually and with scenes where they play off of each other. The focus on character really works to its advantage. In the first film I didn&#039;t have much reason to care about them because they came off as kind of dull and listless with most of the dialogue being used to establish parts of the plot and not actually developing them. In this one, they give you ample reasons to care. You get a real sense of personality from both Mikiya and Shiki. My only real issue with the characters in this is that the supporting characters are largely pointless and really only exist to give Shiki and Mikiya people to talk to besides each other. This is their story, so it kind of makes sense but it still comes off as stilted and unnatural. <br />
<br />
The art is still really strong for textures, backgrounds and atmosphere. The character models are still decent enough, but kind of standard. The blood physics are much more natural in this one. Although there is one scene where they&#039;re obviously off and it kind of screws up the tension a bit. <br />
<br />
The voice acting is much better in this one. Both Sakamoto Maaya and Suzumura Kenichi get to demonstrate their talents. The music also works much better at building atmosphere than it did in the previous film. Probably because it doesn&#039;t succumb to really obvious horror cliches. <br />
<br />
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There&#039;s no yuri here. It doesn&#039;t even pass the Bechdel test since Touko only shows up in one scene and she doesn&#039;t interact with Shiki but Mikiya. <br />
<br />
So, how does this compare to the first movie? Well, it&#039;s much stronger in virtually every respect, which you may have been able to surmise by my having positive things to say where I didn&#039;t previously. The major characters get proper introductions, the atmosphere is excellent and the story is pretty well paced. This should&#039;ve been the first film. A quick note on chronology: this actually is the first film. The first four KnK movies were released out of order, for some reason. Normally I would just say that it was to give a non-linear story, but each film so far has had a self-contained story and been only loosely connected. So that can&#039;t be it. I&#039;m just going to make up my own explanation. The Ufotable team got drunk to celebrate the project and they mixed up the first four scripts. Is the first film better in retrospect? No. No it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s still a painfully slow mess with some really dumb plot points. The characters still come off as dull and listless, especially when you compare them to the versions in this one, and the last fifteen minutes still have a bunch of stilted &quot;suicide is bad, mmmkay&quot; speeches which culminate in one of the worst dialogues I&#039;ve ever seen. This one, however, I did quite like. It still has issues, but nothing too bad. I&#039;m going to give KnK 2 a 7/10. You&#039;ll probably like it if you can get into character studies. If you&#039;re expecting a really in-depth crime story, however, it might not be to your liking. Thank you Duck_S3R, Eastunder and GoldenBRS, for encouraging me to give the franchise another chance and for being nice and intelligent enough that I was inclined to listen. I&#039;ll get back to KnK at the end of the week. In the meantime, I have some other films to examine. Starting with Ghost in the Shell.

    Once again Kara no Kyoukai has managed to score a 10/10 in all departments from me. Why? Because once again it has pulled off the story in absolute brilliance, leaving very little out from the original story and using a superb soundtrack combined with the brilliant animation to create another masterpiece. <br />
<br />
In terms of chronological order, this movie is first in the timeline, therefore it is much more accessible than the first movie. The movie focuses much more on character development and allows the viewer to understand more about Shiki. Once again Nasu&#039;s work has been done justice in this outstanding movie adaptation.<br />
<br />
For those who

          <span style="display: none;" id="review6114">
        haven&#039;t seen the first film, I would suggest watching it. Although it is possible to watch the second movie without seeing the first, it is much easier to understand Shiki&#039;s character if you have seen the first film. Overall I believe that this film is excellent, and would appeal to any Type-moon fan or fans of series with complex undertones.

    This is my first review on MAL ! <br />
Kara no kyoukai is a series that I&#039;ve been willing to try for a long time now and I finally started it yesterday with high expectations. I am watching this in the release order + for the first time : <br />
*Art : 9/10 : It is stunning , specially the background and its beautifully drawn details. The light is perfect and matches the atmosphere. The reason I&#039;m not rating this a 10 is the eyes... I find them at times way too blank or big (the male lead&#039;s case) and this might sound picky yet it really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219971">
        bothers me at times.<br />
*Animation is decent I am not even going to rate it since there were nearly no action scenes or focus on movements. <br />
*Sound : 8/10 Like the previous Film , the soundtrack fits perfectly.<br />
*Story : 5/10 : a prequel to first movie.The focus was rather on the nature of the two main characters as it also kind of clarifies the bond shared btw both of them (How they met ... ) To say the least , unique is the adjective that could describe this story , but it being different and new to some extent doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;ll be good when not handled well. It isn&#039;t interesting enough since it only touches the surface even if the dialogue seems to dig in the depth.<br />
The fact that there&#039;s yet much to know makes the point of the whole movie either to make you curious or just slightly uncover some of the facts and since there&#039;s an ending or rather a result to all what happened in the movie (How Shiki&#039;s behaviour was dealt with) with the cause or the reason like I said earlier insufficient and unconvincing (due to lack of revelation : just saying it is because of psychological instability is not enough ) I can&#039;t seem as a viewer to buy that explanation. <br />
*Characters : 4/10 <br />
Let me start with <br />
- Mikiya : Is he just believing in what he wants to ? Creating an illusion and just going along with it while using &#039;love&#039; to justify it ... I don&#039;t understand the reason there&#039;s so much &#039;depth&#039; in his feelings towards Shiki and I don&#039;t buy &#039;love&#039; as an excuse either... He doesn&#039;t know enough and accepts everything the way it is or at least seems to and I dislike this type of characters.<br />
- Shiki : I feel neutral towards her character she&#039;s interesting enough and I believe we&#039;ll get to know her better (hopefully) in the next movies. She has a heavy past as it seems and just acts under its effect .<br />
- The rest are well , there aren&#039;t many are there ? they are decent.<br />
<br />
Overall : 5/10 <br />
I recommend this movie to those who are interested in finishing the whole series and not this movie in particular because what it lacks may be fixed with the next ones.

    Kara no kyoukai 2:satsujin kousatsu(part1) in the chronology of kara no kyoukai this should be the 1st episode of the animation this&#039;s when the viewer will see how the main character meet each other and so the supporting character along with the series,its all started here,in this episode it only focus mainly the 2 main character and some sub-char,the viewer will see the relationship between the 2 mains char while still high school and how the progress their relationship along with,the character are well explained their past.<br />
The art and char design is just as fluent and fit for the animation except just lack of action

          <span style="display: none;" id="review165813">
        animation not like the first series but the background and the environment was really improved in this anime,the character design is just the same as the first series it just the character have alot movement and character expression was improved and its was excellent <br />
The sound or BMG not really improved alot but some scene with the BMG was really enjoyed to listen..<br />
Even with some flaws is still enjoyable movies to watch..

    This is the second part of a 7 part series. With the first movie there was serious lacking in the character development department, with this movie however there was not only a story line but you actually got to understand a bit about the characters and where they&#039;re coming from. Story moves quite slowly, and there are many instances where you will be staring at the same pointless scene for far too long. Such as her lying down for bed and a random shot of her room is on screen for about 45 seconds. This may have been done to add suspense, but it didn&#039;t

          <span style="display: none;" id="review15286">
        work for me and just made me want to hit the FF button. Unlike the first movie this one actually made me interested to see where the characters go from here. The story line in this one seems more like a stand alone side quest of the back story to the characters appearing in the rest of the movies. But that&#039;s a good thing, because if you can&#039;t care about the characters in a series, then I can&#039;t care about whatever happens to them in the series. Has many flaws, but is still leaps and bounds better than the first. If you watched the first one and decided not to continue I urge you to give this one a shot.

    I watched the first Kara no Kyoukai last night and wrote a review for it in which I complained about the lack of back story. This second movie really should have been the first movie since it does give you some character introduction (it takes place before the events in the first movie I believe) although it is still not much. Anyway on to the review:<br />
<br />
Story (9): Like the first movie the story was engaging and made you eager to find out what was going to happen next. Unlike the first movie, Satsujin Kousatsu had a story that did not feel like you should already

          <span style="display: none;" id="review7869">
        know whats going on. That being said the story itself did leave a lot of unanswered questions which I suspect will be explained in later movies (partially explains pseudo-cliffhanger ending I guess) but as a stand alone movie I cannot give it a perfect story score.<br />
<br />
Art (10): The art style of the second movie was just as good as the first if not better. The attention to detail is staggering with especially in terms of light and reflections. During the katana sparring scene the detail on each beam of light poking through the window slits was enough to take my eye away from the fight if only for a moment. The lighting of the bamboo forest scene was also memorable. Character design is well above average too.<br />
<br />
Sound (9): Once again the voice actors do their jobs well and the music matches the tone almost perfectly. There were a few sound effects that seemed a bit off but you have to listen very closely. Also the variation in Shiki&#039;s voice between her personalities is done well.<br />
<br />
Character (8): As interesting as the characters seem to be we only know a little bit about the main characters and virtually nothing about everyone else. Even though we did finally get some back story on Shiki and Kotoku, there are still mountains of unanswered questions and Kotoku&#039;s background is still virtually unknown. Also there are some character aspects that in my opinion just didn&#039;t seem realistic but I cant give examples here because they would be spoilers but lets just say no sane person would trust a person THAT much. Other than that though the characters were very deep, almost too deep but its better than being too shallow. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment (9): An engaging story, an art style that is pure eye candy, a haunting soundtrack, and deep characters make this a very enjoyable movie, Its nice to finally have some clues about what is going on but now it has me begging for more.

    The second movie in the Garden of Sinners series focuses much more on explaining character relationships, yet it has a completely different feeling to the first movie. Where the first movie had an eerie and mysterious feel throughout, this movie had some sweet moments included in there and the creepy moments felt WAY more creepy.<br />
<br />
So in the first movie, we were introduced to Shiki’s character. Though in the first movie, she acts as a saviour of sorts, in this one, we are introduced to a darker side of Shiki. It is revealed that she has two personalities of sorts, a sombre and supposedly tranquil one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review240123">
        and an outgoing, yet perhaps more sinister personality. In the city, there have been some murders occurring and Shiki is shown around the bodies. The question is, is she the one causing the murders, or is she just an innocent bystander that has the ability to sense these things? It’s definitely hard to decide.<br />
<br />
Kokutou on the other hand is quite unwavering in his faith to Shiki. He develops an interest in her and decides to follow her around like a lost puppy, even though she tries very hard to keep him away. Sometimes the viewer may feel that he has absolutely no sense of self preservation, but he must have the ability to sense that there was something magical about her. There is quite a notable cute scene in which Kokutou and Shiki are standing under the rain and she gets lost in the comfort of his presence whilst he hums a playful tune. It was a nice moment of relief amidst the foreboding feeling of the film.<br />
<br />
The animation and soundtrack are once again, flawless. The bamboo forest is absolutely my favourite aspect, with the vivid nature of the gruesome murder sites coming in close second.<br />
<br />
In this movie, though there isn’t a plethora of events occurring, the major question on why Kokutou was so close to Shiki is revealed. As Shiki grapples with her two personalities, it’s quite interesting adding another layer to her character.

    When I reviewed the first Kara no Kyoukai movie I was dissapointed with how the story was developing through it. I was hoping to see more than I had been actually shown. Still, I have decided to watch the second movie hoping that the potential which was not realised in the first movie would finally be unleashed in the second one... and it was, to an extent I have not anticipated.<br />
<br />
The second Kara no Kyoukai movie takes place before the first one when Shiki was still inside Shiki. Unlike the first movie, the second movie has the qualities of a jigsaw. Although you see most

          <span style="display: none;" id="review16354">
        elements of it from the very begining, throughout the whole movie you start putting them together, not only answering the question in the trailer about the identities  of Shiki, but also how the two main characters of the movie became who they are and what secret do they hold.<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t give you out anymore details, but mark my words when I say, in terms of storyline this movie gives you everything you expect and even a bit more.<br />
<br />
When it comes to art, this movie is very similar to the first one in terms of overall quality. It looks great, it&#039;s mysterious and what&#039;s more important it can actually give you goose bumps.<br />
<br />
Although, there is no stunning fighting sequence similar to that of the first movie, there is something I myself found more memorable, something that is engraved into your mind... the gruesome scenes of murder and what&#039;s even more terryfing, yet beautiful at the same time, the scenes of the assailant.<br />
<br />
The sound is very good. The voice acting is on a very good level. The one flaw from which the music suffered in the first movie, which was the fact that some parts of the score written seemed completely different than the other, has been elimintated in the second movie. It develops along with the storyline and blends in very good with what is happening on the screen.<br />
<br />
The potential held in the characters, which was not used too much in the first movie, has been brought out making them not only interesting, but also tragic and watching them develop was a bond creating experience.<br />
<br />
Unlike the first movie, which prima facie seems to be a mile better after we get to know the characters that play part in it, I was disturbed with the fact that I simply did not get what I expected. After the second, movie just the opposite happened, I liked the movie so much that it seemed to short, further more it also cleared some things about the first movie, therefore making giving it a possible re-watch status. Last but not least, I got so hooked up on the chracter of Shiki, that I urge to watch the third movie.

    Kara no kyoukai 2: Satsujin Koukatsu is an improvement over the first installment of the series and could be enjoyed as a movie to dedicate one hour to experience it&#039;s story and development. It presents interesting but not correctly developed characters and a more than decent animation quality that makes it deserving of being watched. <br />
<br />
The story seems deep superficially and it isn&#039;t really deep, it isn&#039;t deep because the way they developed it&#039;s central point wasn&#039;t the way they hoped to develop it and they could have developed it way better than it finally was, the story centers around a lady named shiki Ryougi

          <span style="display: none;" id="review300458">
        who meets a guy named Mikiya Kokutou in the winter of 1995 while he passed her during a late night stroll in the snow. The flaws that the story has doesn&#039;t prevent it from being enjoyable at some degree and eventhough they are notable they aren&#039;t capable of denying any of the well made aspects that it has.<br />
<br />
The art is great and even better than in the first entry of the series, the way they handled the colours and shadows and the way they handled the day/night dynamic couldn&#039;t have been done better. This was one of the aspects i enjoyed the most of this movie because i really do like good animation and this one was one of them.<br />
<br />
The sound aspect was a part that i also really enjoyed because the way they used it to give the atmosphere a higher degree of intensity was deserving of praise, it was really well handled and attained it&#039;s purpose really well.<br />
<br />
The show has glaring flaws as can be seen in how they used seconds that were too long and too many for certaim scenes amd that was one aspect that really stole some of the show&#039;s potential of captivating the audience and be capable of being deserving of much more praise but all in all the show was still enjoyable and good enough to deserve a watch.

    Okay, so if you have watched the 1st movie, you would be wondering if you should continue the series since you are utterly confused. The second movie gives a great insight on the main character Shiki (式) and SHIKI (織) that she has a dual personality. <br />
<br />
So, to start things off, the makers of this movie has not reduced the level of blood spilled in this movie, which is good for those &quot;I love gore&quot; people and the romance between the two main characters is not to shabby at all. Most anime romance goes through repetitious, lovey pink bubbles, big glowing eyes waiting for you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review13533">
        either kill yourself or constantly tell yourself to endure the pain. <br />
<br />
As always in anime, there is always a person who cares for another person to the point where you think it&#039;s kind of awkward for a person to be that consistent. But since this is a story that entertains people, it cannot be dealt with. Moreover, the long pauses on a certain scene actually makes you wonder if either the DvD or movie is frozen since nothing is happening.  <br />
<br />
The movie also curtails the details about everything that is occurring, making you even more confused to begin with. However, most of this is ignored since the main character goes around killing people at night with a knife in a kimono. You might think to yourself that this is right out creepy seeing a cute anime girl running around at night with a kitchen knife stabbing people and cutting off every limb on their bodies, but the feeling is direct. <br />
<br />
Thus, I give this movie an overall rating of a 9.

    Didn&#039;t expect this to be a prequel. Actually I think it would work better in chronological order rather than like this. I&#039;m a bit bothered that in the end the most important thing was not made entirely clear. Though we are left to infer it, but it just might be asking for a bit too much, in how much it expects us to assume and figure out what went on off-screen. And if that wasn&#039;t bad enough, pacing is slow.<br />
<br />
 I&#039;ll admit slow pacing is crucial to the atmosphere and feel they&#039;re achieving, but at times it&#039;s just too slow. At least 40% could easily

          <span style="display: none;" id="review193101">
        be shaved off of static scenes while still retaining the overall feel. It&#039;s tricky writing this, as this &#039;&#039;movie&#039;&#039; has a &#039;&#039;part 1&#039;&#039; in it&#039;s name, so I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s more to come. But taken on it&#039;s own, it&#039;s thematic points are exploration of the mind of a psycho and telling a romance story. <br />
<br />
Second one was nicely articulated, it really shows both the power and craziness of love in a dramatic character-driven way. Exploring the psycho mind on the other hand wasn&#039;t bad, but it feels like something&#039;s still missing. In other words, I didn&#039;t really get to figure out why psycho thinks the way it thinks, though I might be halfway there, in understanding it, the viewpoint of this story&#039;s particular character that is. I wonder if part 2 will expand upon it, or go in another direction.

    Pt2. Review<br />
<br />
Kara no Kyoukai 2: Satsujin Kousatsu is the 2nd movie to be released in the Kara no Kyoukai series and focuses mainly on the events between Shiki &amp; Kokutou in their high school days.<br />
<br />
Now, let me start by saying that the after watching the 1st movie, I was instantly hooked into the series and was eagerly waiting to know more about the characters which this movie did focus but the overall character interactions &amp; developments were disappointing to watch. <br />
<br />
Although at first interesting, the weird pacing of the movie makes the said interactions or developments between our two mc boring. Besides, the male mc

          <span style="display: none;" id="review353156">
        ‘s decision to not report crime while supporting the female mc just cause he was in “love” was so out of place &amp; frustrating to watch.<br />
<br />
The story for the most part was ok but the pacing was all over the place. Also the movie ending abruptly and time jumping to the events before the 1st movie also didn’t help the overall pacing.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, The mixture of cg and 2d animation were as always blended nicely and the soundtrack succeeded in creating the overall environment for the movie.<br />
<br />
Overall, a huge let down for me from the first movie. Hope the future sequels will be more interesting and evenly placed.<br />
<br />
Story- 4/10<br />
Characters- 3/10<br />
Art- 8/10<br />
Sound- 9/10<br />
Enjoyment- 5/10<br />
Overall- 6/10<br />

    As I said last time, my main issue with the first KnK movie was that we didn’t get much information about our main characters. We got the gist of them, sure, but sadly not much else. Thankfully, Kara no Kyoukai Satsujin Kousatsu Zen (Borderline Of Emptiness Murder Speculation Part 1) fixes that and then some.<br />
<br />
Setting the movie a few years before the first one was probably a good idea. I mean, if we spent any more movies without learning how these two met, I probably would’ve gone insane.<br />
<br />
On that note, the tone is definitely different from the first one. The colors are much more vibrant,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review294814">
        and surprisingly there’s next to no supernatural elements. There’s even a bit of classic Nasu Slice Of Life comedy added in for good measure (Thankfully no sex because Nasu sucks at writing sex).<br />
It also somewhat feels more like a first episode than the last movie. You honestly get more of a feel for how these characters are meant to be like from this movie rather than the last one. The only thing that fully prevents it from being a first episode is that there’s next to no supernatural elements.<br />
<br />
One thing this movie does right from the get go is that I care way more about our leads than before. We see more about Shiki, and she’s probably a bit more messed up than I thought. I mean, I already mentioned why the other Nasuverse leads aren’t normal in my last review, but this woman straight up suffers from split personality disorder or something similar (Hell, they even have different names: Shiki and SHIKI (Not to be confused with Capslock-Kun)).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Mikiya is the complete opposite, and I think that’s why I probably liked him. The guy’s basically just an average Joe. Normally this would make him pretty boring, but since this is the freaking Nasuverse this actually makes him stand out. Sure, he’s hopelessly naïve, but otherwise he’s got a good head on his shoulder and seems to be at least somewhat mentally stable.<br />
<br />
Another thing I did like is their relationship. I do know how their relationship will end (My memory isn’t THAT bad) and you can see the seeds of a more serious relationship being planted here. It’s honestly adorable to say the least.<br />
<br />
Like the first movie, there is a bit of a mystery element to it. Dare I say, it’s even more noticeable now. The whole string of murders is visually disturbing to say the least. The reveal of Shiki being the killer is, while somewhat obvious in hindsight, is also well done. However I’m pretty sure there’s likely more to this than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
Finally there’s the big final fight… and there technically isn’t one. Really, the closest thing to it is Mikiya doing the best he can to not be killed by Shiki. We know he’ll live (I mean, the last movie took place after this one and he’s still alive there) but damn if it ain’t intense, especially as Mikiya’s role as the everyman comes back to bite him considering that he’s clearly outmatched.<br />
<br />
So overall, this was a fun movie. I wish I could give it a higher score, but at the same time, I think that the movie is just doesn’t add enough for me to give it a higher score. That said, it’s a fun origin story and I recommend it.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    Compared to the first film&#039;s story line, this film mainly focuses on a fixed story line with character development on Shiki and Mikiya. It mainly shows more in-depth detail about Shiki and Mikiya and how those two interact with each other. Otherwise, mystery side of story is also decently fun is watch.<br />
