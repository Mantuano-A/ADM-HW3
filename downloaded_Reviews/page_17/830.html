    A cute girl? You got that here.<br />
A depressed story? You&#039;d be crying twice.<br />
Interesting characters? Without any doubt.<br />
A good father figure? Better than mine (kidding).<br />
Thoughtful moments? It&#039;s deeper than you think.<br />
<br />
This anime is everything you could wish for. From the character gimmicks to the grandiose story. You wouldn&#039;t immediately think about any of this at first as it has a slow start but when it starts for real it goes at 360 in 6 seconds and you can not go back. Oh no you can&#039;t, and that&#039;s a good thing. Why go back when you can experience such a thing in the first place? Its something

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332948">
        that happens twice in 400 years and the time has finally come for this masterpiece to be seen.<br />
<br />
Yes, &quot;Somali to Mori no Kamisama&quot; is a masterpiece of an anime and not simply one of them, it&#039;s THE masterpiece I was looking for. An anime it could make me laugh, think, cry and more importantly care about characters, each of them and all in a span of 12 episodes. &quot;Somali&quot; is extraordinarily in every field but the best thing about this are clearly the two main characters, Somali and Golem that share a great daughter-father relationship. They&#039;re not releated by blood but that&#039;s the great thing since it shows that it is not necessary to be related by blood to show the effect to someone. They are so fantastic together and what makes it better is the fact that Golem has no emotions, so you at no point of its runtime you&#039;ll hearing him scream because Somali did something she shouldn&#039;t have. He comprehend many emotions, but since it cannot manifest them, it is difficult to fully understand them. Which is completely natural and makes the relationship between the two even realistic.<br />
<br />
The story is incredibly beautiful. While sometimes predictable, It got me invested that I never thought it would have. This has mainly to do with the characters that make it interesting. Throughout the journey (yes, this is not an anime, its a journey and I&#039;ll be observing until it ends) we meet a lot of charaters that in the surface may seem not that great but if you go deep into them you&#039;d find so much regarding them that i&#039;m sure you&#039;d be pleased. They, when doing something have always a reason. Now, the reason may be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in the way you view it. I viewed as good and will always be because I can feel them and their hatred or love for anything seems reasonable. I really can, which it makes me love the anime even more. It proceeds with the right narrative rhythm, without slowing down too much, taking the time necessary to create characters with a certain thickness and it does quite well.<br />
<br />
As for animation, I think it&#039;s fantastic, even in action scenes. It is not a series that you would see too many fights, but for what we got the animation was really competent. It&#039;s not the best, I admit it but then again this is not an action anime when fights have the priority so therefore it doesn&#039;t matter. As for the the sound deparment, it&#039;s great too. I expected The opening and ending be more catchy but unfortunately that wasn&#039;t the case. Not saying they&#039;re bad, it&#039;s just I wasn&#039;t too much interested in them as much I wanted to be. They&#039;re good on their own way, though. OSTs instead are literary masterpiece. Especially the ones that are used for sad moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somali to Mori no Kamisama&quot; is both underrated and underwatched. It&#039;s not getting the attention as much I&#039;d like to. If you&#039;re reading this review and you&#039;re in search of an anime that has a genuine good story, awesomely characters and more importantly, daughter-father interaction - this is the one you&#039;ve been looking for. There may be stuff that potentially could turn you off but overrall I think it deserves a try.<br />
<br />
Golem is such a good father.

    Somali to Mori no Kamisama is a masterpiece of storytelling. It is a great adventure that displays the different ideologies of creatures, their lives and how going through life changes you as a person. <br />
<br />
From the start, the anime tells you that you are about to embark on a journey and to get ready for the different ideas you will find. <br />
<br />
I think the 2 biggest reasons that affect how much I rate an anime are how much I enjoy the anime and how great the characters are. Of course an anime about going into the unknown and exploring what the world has to offer

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332956">
        is more than enough for me to enjoy the anime but I’m glad to say that it wasn’t the only reason I watched it. <br />
<br />
The characters in Somali and the forest spirit are great. We have the main cast: Somali and the Golem. <br />
<br />
Somali is one of the best representation of a child in anime. You have the innocent girl that has the sense of exploring that all children have, the adorable cute nature of hers is so entertaining to watch and how pure and kind she is becomes more apparent once you watch more of the anime. You become invested in her character and that is (imo) one of the best compliments you can give to a creator. <br />
<br />
The Golem on the other hand is the complete opposite of her, he is a spirit made to simply observe how the forest is and he doesn’t know how to feel anything let alone display it. As you go on the journey with them, you start noticing changes in him. He stars growing more attached to Somali and little by little he starts experiencing emotions. He becomes more protective of Somali and he starts becoming more and more like an actual father figure for her. His growth throughout the series is amazing to see and how much he develops from the start to the great finale.<br />
 <br />
The side characters of the anime are great. Every episode presents a new set of characters that are unique with different ideologies that makes them interesting. Their interactions with each other and with Somali give out so much enjoyment and proves more the great effect an amazing character can have on a well-written cast. <br />
<br />
<br />
One of the things I really liked was the representation of humans in different perspectives. You start the anime with Somali and your perspective is hers so you see humans as the cute and kind type of characters but as you go on, you start seeing how horrible they have been to every other character they meet. The fear that made them become a natural enemy to almost every species you see throughout the series. That change of perspective gives the idea that we humans are not all the same and that is presented in front of you. You see Somali, the kind human that accepts everyone, You most of the other humans that have no reason and just kill everyone and you see a child understand that not everything is how it looks and she changes from the bad to the good. This idea made me rate the anime higher than I already had. <br />
<br />
<br />
The sound, art, animation and overall atmosphere of the anime is fantastic and an incredible job done by the voice actors made this anime shine.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give the anime a 10/10. A fantastic journey that I hope to see more of and more like. <br />
Would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a great journey with greater characters.

     Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have watching Somali To Mori Na Kamisama and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br />
<br />
Based off a popular web manga of the same name Somali To Mori No Kamisama otherwise better known by its English title of Somali and the forest spirit is an adventure, drama and fantasy genre anime, that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a human child were to one day encounter and adapt the first

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332947">
        being that they encountered as their father. What will happen if one day this unlikely pair were forced by circumstance to embark on a continent-spanning journey that will see them journey across vast lands to make contact with the remnants of the human race and in doing so bring the child back to its race before the end claims the brave watchmen of the forest. Within the anime world, Adventure and drama genre anime that takes place in a fantasy setting can be said to be one of the more popular combinations due to both its popularity among both fans and creators and the sheer amount of freedom that a fantasy setting can give to the creation of not just races but also lore and relationship dynamics as well. In my case what served to draw me to this series was both the fantasy and adventure genre combinations which are ones that I always liked to see but also the unique element of the unique bond and relationship that exists between the two main characters of Somali and golem. The fact that both are beings of different races and ages only served to intrigue me even more. The first ep of the series I felt was an interesting one that while doing well in setting the series main setting and circumstance that led to humanity’s fall from grace also did well to showcase the unique relationship that existed between Somali and golem a fact that convinced me to watch the series to the end to see how this will end a decision that I never regretted.<br />
<br />
Taking place within a fantasy-themed world where humans are but one of many races that inhabit the world and a world where most races seem to exist in perfect harmony with each other the overall story follows the life and journeys of a most unlikely due who met by chance within the sacred forests that Golem was tending as part of his duties. As if destiny had intervened Golem’s encounter with the human girl Somali not just awakened within him a desire to not just understand the curious manifestation of the feelings and emotions that have arisen inside him but also create a new spark inside him that will motivate him for the first time in his century-old life to not only step foot outside of the forests that had been both his home and his area of responsibility but also embark on a perilous journey across the world to find the remnants of humanity that had withdrawn from the world in response to the hatred their actions had generated in the past and deliver Somali to them. But as Somali and Golem embark on their quest and step foot into the world they soon realize that while on the surface the world outside is indeed beautiful and peaceful and one where the various races work in harmony together to live their lives free of conflict that beneath this is a dangerous undercurrent of hostility that’s directed at not just strangers but also at the remains of humanity whose past crimes and actions had not been forgotten by the races of the world. In the face of this threat, Golem must exercise not just every bit of caution that he has but also for the first time in his life seek to understand and make use off the unique advantages that’s one bond can bring in their quest to ensure that both will reach their destination before the end comes. <br />
<br />
Somali <br />
<br />
Somali portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of 5 Toubun no Hanayome and Daimachi fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A young human child that was encountered by golem deep within his assigned forest Somali on initial appearances was shown to be a positive, cheerful and innocent person by nature that like most children her age was energetic and possessed an infinite amount of curiosity at everything that she encountered in life an aspect that I felt added significant charm to her character. As a result of being the first adult that she met after waking up, Somali was shown to view golem as her father despite the obvious differences in race something that is seen to be the defining trait within their relationship. While their initial relationship, in the beginning, was shown to be rather rocky and somewhat lacking in resemblance to actual parent-child relationships that were apparent in other societies it can be seen that despite this Somali believed wholeheartedly that she and Golem were a family as seen in not just her physical imitations of the actions that she seen other families partake in as well as in her strong belief that she and golem remain together never to separate. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the series, Somali due to her young age was shown to be someone that took life rather care freely and only saw each day as a new adventure that was to be used to the fullest. As a result of this mentality, Somali was shown to prioritise fun over-caution which more often than not often caused her to be put into precarious situations that required intervention from others. However, as the series went on and Somali began to see the amount of effort that Golem put in to protect her and take care of her this gradually began to change both physically and mentally. While remaining energetic and positive in attitude Somali gradually began to rein in her often infinitely desire to explore new locations and meet new people becoming much more cautious of not just her own actions but also of the many new areas and people that they meet in their journey. While knowing that her small size means that she will be unable to do many of the more difficult tasks that are necessary Somali nonetheless readily steps up to take up new tasks that arise during their journey showing a determination to not just improve herself as a person but also attempt to lessen the burden that Golem has in taking care of her. <br />
<br />
While changing substantially in terms of attitude Somali’s view of Golem as the series progresses gradually starts to change as a result of the ever-increasing bond that is forged between the two within the series. As noted previously due to the circumstances of the first encounter between Somali and Golem Somali from the onset viewed Golem as her parent and as a result was shown to respect him immensely. However while certainly thankful of both the guidance and safety that was provided by him Somali was also seen to view their bond with some element of sadness due to both the lack of genuine family warmth within their relationship compared to what she see’s other families exhibit as well as the fact that due to his nature Golem can neither express strong emotions or eat and taste which ensured that despite her longing that the family bonds between them were only a pseudo one that was created out of necessity. This somewhat negative view on their bond however gradually began to change due to both Golem’s evolution as an individual as well as Somali’s realization that family does not necessarily mean ones borne of the same bloodline but can also mean bonds between individuals that love and care about each other strongly as well a revelation that served to be the final key that will banish the last of Somali’s doubts and fears and allow her to be more upfront with her attempts to forge a stronger bond with Golem a fact that is shown well in ep11 when she hand created a gift for him to show her love for him as a father. <br />
<br />
In terms of overall character development, I felt that as a character Somali was one that was both well designed and developed both physically and mentally with her gradual evolution from a child that only saw each day as a new adventure to one that not only tried to alleviate some of that adventure’s burden by helping when she can but also in the process try to change others nature by leveraging the bonds between them to make them better individuals being especially so. While certainly still a child and one whose knowledge of the world is still lacking I felt that Somali’s innate positivity and determination to trust in the best of others allowed her to not just make many discoveries about life and in the process adapt her own to incorporate said lessons but also allow her to use her views to effectively deescalate any situations that she and Golem encounters along the way in a way that’s always to the best interests of the parties involved with the best example within the series being the resolution of Uzoi and Haitora’s issues that within the series was one of the darker and more serious events that they encountered. While allowing them to resolve issues peacefully and in the process also enabling her to make many new friends within the series this aspect of Somali I felt also represented well that despite the injustice present in this otherwise perfect world that there is nothing else more important in life than friendships and bonds between family and friends that will allow you to overcome any trial that you encounter along the way. <br />
<br />
Golem <br />
<br />
Golem portrayed by veteran voice actor Daisuke Ono of Attack on Titan and Durarara fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main male lead of the series. A member of the golem race a nigh mythical race that was given the sacred role of being the guardians of the world’s forests long ago. On initial appearances, golem was shown to be a calm, composed and intelligent person by nature that despite the unchanging nature of his role was one that seemed content with the sense of calm and responsibility that the role had given his life. As a result of this Golem, in the beginning, was seen to be wary of outsiders due to both his dictates that prohibit interaction with beings that are not of the forest as well as his own reluctance to become involved in anything that will upset the unending nature of his life as shown in his initial interactions with Somali. However while certainly reluctant to step out of the protective bubble that his role as a guardian of the forest had given him Golem despite his solitude within the forest was shown to be someone that was both surprisingly well learned of the world’s history given his knowledge of the rise and fall of humanity but also surprisingly understanding and considerate of the feelings of others as well as shown in not just the first encounters that he had with Somali but also in his decision to leave the forest that had until now served as his home and embark on a journey to reunite Somali with her people due to his desire to protect her from the dangers of this world. <br />
<br />
As the series progresses and Golem and Somali’s relationship improves over the course of their journey Golem’s personality too gradually begins to change as a result of the experiences that both encounter and overcome in their journey. In the beginning of the series Golem as a result of his life within the forest was shown to be someone that was quiet and was someone that approached situations in life with logic that while allowing him to overcome much of the challenges that were encountered in their journey also had the unfortunate effect of creating distance between Golem and Somali due to the almost robotic-like persona that Golem made use off. A distance that while creating both a physical and psychological distance between the two also had the unfortunate effect of creating an image that was far from the idea of a family among the minds of the beings that they encountered in their journey. However, as their journey continued and Golem began to realize not just the amount of physical care but also the mental consideration that was needed to both care for and raise young living beings this aspect of Golem began to change. While still preferring to approach the situations that he encounters with logic Golem also realised that while effective in terms of decision making that this approach will not work with the raising and care of Somali whose unpredictable temperament and unique body structure rendered such logic unworkable. As a result of this Golem was forced to not only reevaluate not just his approach in handling relations with others but also in how he should interact with Somali as well and in the case of the latter opting to for the first time in his life to explore the concept of emotion by showing kindness, care and consideration towards Somali’s nature and unique needs. While certainly a rocky path and one that was not without hardships such as Golem’s inability to sense Somali’s pain that led to her to falling ill this embrace of emotions, in the long run, proved to be a valuable lesson for Golem as it allowed him to not only take better care of Somali both physically and emotionally but also in the process give him the rather unique opportunity to not only improve himself as both a golem and as a father of sorts but also give him the rare opportunity to be able to raise a child that will serve to turn back the negative image that people have of the human race as a result of that races past actions. <br />
<br />
In terms of overall development as a character, I felt that Golem was one that was well designed and developed with his gradual evolution from a quiet being that relied solely on logic to accomplish his duties in life to one that was forced to not only rebuild himself from the ground up by embracing the very concept that he was so adamant in opposing the use off to both raise and guild the new child that he found himself in charge of being especially well done. While lacking any concept as well as a means to express strong emotions like joy and happiness I felt that even without this ability it was still heartwarming to see Golem’s reactions to Somali’s actions whether they were positive ones such as being awkward in receiving a gift from her or negative ones such as his determination to save her from danger as these proved that strong bonds between family transcend even races and is one that’s universal across every race regardless of age or time. <br />
<br />
AMV <br />
<br />
In terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well designed and took excellent advantage of the lore of the world to create some unique races. Notable races that I found to be the more curious ones were the wooly Shurigara that Kikila belonged too, the harpy’s that Uzoi belonged too and the witches of the forest that Hazel and her sister Praline belonged too. While each of these races with the exception of Kikila was standard fantasy races I felt that in each case the individual representatives of each race served well to exemplify them and show that even in this world there are many individuals that will treat others not with caution but with kindness and care. In terms of locations, I felt that the series managed to feature quite the impressive collection of locations that were visited by Somali and Golem that were both unique and beautiful which was further aided by the bright and soft colours that were used in animating them. <br />
<br />
Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Arigatou Wa Kocchi no Kotoba that was performed by Naotarou Moriyama while the ending theme was performed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase who also portrayed the character of Somali within the series. Both of these songs I felt were excellent ones that conveyed a very different sense of feeling with the former being a slower-paced song that gives the impression of the beginning of a brand new adventure that will allow its participants to not only explore new land but also forge lasting bonds between each other as they travel together while the latter’s equally slow-paced but yet calming tone gave the impression of the fun times that the duo’s many adventures have rewarded them and how their overcoming of the many challenges that had barred their way has enabled them to improve their bonds as father and daughter. <br />
<br />
Voice acting-wise I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. However, among the cast, I felt that Inori Minase, Daisuke Ono, Hiroki Nanami, Tatsuhisa Suzuki, Saori Hayami and Yuuki Ono deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Somali, Golem, Shizuno, Yabashira, Uzoi and Haitora respectively. <br />
<br />
Overall conclusion <br />
<br />
In overall Somali and the Forest spirit, I felt was an excellent anime and was one of this seasons best ones on account of its unique take on a familiar premise, an intriguing story, excellent cast of characters both in terms of main and guest characters, excellent voice acting and its skilful blending of both hope, despair and a determination to be the spark that will change the nature of the world in which they live in. <br />
<br />
The overall premise and story of the series was without a doubt one of the main highlights of the series due largely to the fusion of well designed and developed characters, emotional attachment, and the encountering and subsequent overcoming of the various trials that barred their way trials that were as much physical ones as they were psychological ones. While an anime that features relationships between characters of two different races encountering and bonding with another as they interact isn’t itself rare within the anime medium in the case of this series this aspect I felt was used to great success due to two different factors that served to complement each other. The first of these was the fact that the human race to which Somali belonged too had not only fallen from grace due to their past actions but had also been all but exterminated by the other races and leaving Somali as the only other human her age within the areas in which she and Golem operated in. The second factor was the unique origin and role of Golem who until the coming of Somali served his role as watchmen of the forest with due reverence living a life that was unchanging as time was and having little opportunity to interact with either events or individuals from outside his domain. The combination of both characters being both strangers to each other and relative outcasts to the world itself I felt served to complement each other remarkably well as it allowed both to not just forge an entirely new bond and relationship that while shaky at first gradually become much stronger as both characters learned from each other and in the process developed their personalities to complement and support each other in their journey. While certainly cute and heartwarming to look at I felt that this aspect of having both characters learn from each other and develop their own personalities in response to these lessons was an interesting concept that served to make their relationship that much more believable. <br />
<br />
In terms of overall story while the underlying bonds between Somali and Golem served effectively as the underlying foundation for the series I felt that it&#039;s pairing with the series primary world setting of a fantasy world that’s seemingly at peace and its cast of well designed and developed characters that have their unique worries and struggles proved to be the perfect recipe that allowed it to showcase not just the extent of the damage that the human race had done to not just the world but to its people as well both in terms of physical relations between the individual races as well as the deeper scars that lay in one’s heart an aspect that within the series was shown perfectly within Uzoi’s story arc. While certainly a daunting environment for both Somali and Golem to operate in I felt that this also provided an excellent source of challenges that not only served to test the bond between the two of them but also in the process allow them to also directly change the world’s perceptions of humans as a whole while simultaneously improving their own. <br />
<br />
As an overall score, I would say that Somali and the forest spirit easily deserves a final score of 10/10 on account of its unique take on a familiar premise, excellent story that combined both excellent lore and emotional investment, well designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and some surprisingly thought-provoking trials that Golem and Somali were forced to confront within the series. <br />

    Jotaro is finally a good dad!<br />
<br />
This anime is very beautiful. All the visuals and character designs are neat. The characters are interesting, at least the Golem. The backgrounds are nicely created and they look real good. The animation is good even though it really does not need much. The opening is surprisingly good. The music is quite weird but catchy as well. The visuals in the opening are beautiful. The ending is also cool looking. The song is sung by Somalis voice actor. For some reason the ending is CG but the anime doesn&#039;t have or use CG<br />
<br />
Story: We start off by Golem finding a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327872">
        human child abandoned in a forest. He takes care of the child and later names him Somali. In this world humans are thought to be extinct since all the other species hunted them down since humans were kinda dumb. Now Golem and Somali travel around the world looking for Somalis parents or just other humans which is proven to be very difficult. We meet different kinds of creatures every episode. <br />
<br />
Characters: Golem is a very tall and interesting looking character, I just love his design so much. He talks in Unnecessarily obscure language. Everything is so weirdly formatted and spoken out for example &quot;Commence sleep at once&quot; and &quot;Exercise further caution during consumption&quot; He care a lot about Somali and her well being. Somali is a small girl that is disguised as a Minotaur since people hunt down and eat humans. She likes to explore unknown things despite her &quot;Dads&quot; warnings. She likes to chase animals and likes everything cute. She tends to get in trouble with her surroundings.  <br />
<br />
If you like wholesome adventures I recommend this anime to you.

Hot take: Somali to Mori no Kamisama is not primarily about the relationship between a father and daughter but Golem discovering humanity through his relationship with Somali. When I say “humanity,” I am not talking about the human race; Golem is finding his human spirit: empathy, love, purpose, etc. At the beginning of the anime, Golem states his species live exactly a millennia, and the time he has left is a little over a year. Through the first half of the show, he gives the exact amount of days he has left to live. Eventually he stops giving specifics, instead broad estimations such as

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339007">
        “not much,” and in the final episode, he says his time left is unknown. By the end of the series, Golem is no longer just a golem; he is something more: his own person.<br />
<br />
When Somali sees Golem for the first time, she immediately calls him Oto-san (father). In this moment, Golem’s view of the world is put into question for the first time in over 998 years. He has taken solace in his life as the guardian of the forest, never having to question the meaning of his existence. Golem is reluctant to accept the title Somali has given him, and he tries to tell her that she is mistaken, but Somali’s insistence that he is her father eventually leads Golem to accept the title. It is not a misunderstanding when Somali called Golem her Oto-san, she truly sees him as that. Golem starts to see that there can be more to his life than protecting the forest, and it takes Somali looking at him differently to realize this, so Golem decides to set out on a journey with Somali not only to find other humans for her, but also so he can further explore his new identity.<br />
<br />
When their journey starts, Golem is far from the perfect father. He struggles to fully understand Somali’s behaviors and tries to be as logical as possible in his care for her, prioritizing efficiency over everything else. He never has bad intentions, but this commonly leaves Somali feeling frustrated. She struggles to convince Golem of something that is emotionally important to her. There is an arc in the first half of the show where Somali puts herself in danger to retrieve a flower that superstitions say can grant a wish. She wishes to spend the rest of her life with Golem and wants to give him the flower to show this. When Somali gives him the flower, he scolds her for putting herself in danger. Golem does not understand why Somali would risk her well-being for a superstition. To Somali, the flower represents a promise to stay together forever, and when Golem focuses on scolding her instead of first accepting her promise, this breaks Somali’s heart. To her, it now seems staying with each other is unimportant to him. Golem realizes his mistake in handling the situation, apologizes, and learns to better empathize with Somali going forward.<br />
<br />
The following arc introduces a pair of characters extremely similar to our main duo for them to travel alongside. They are another father, Haitora, and daughter, Uzoi, with one of them being human, in their case, the father. Haitora is dying from a curse after eating a harpy, Uzoi’s mother. After realizing he left Uzoi without anyone to care for her, he decides to make it his obligation. Uzoi has been kept in the dark about the reasons behind Haitora’s illness, but eventually finds out what happened to her mother and the original reason Haitora took her in. Uzoi starts to doubt the relationship she has with Haitora, but ultimately comes to forgive him. Somali tells Uzoi that no matter what, love is never a lie, and nobody needs a reason to love someone. Golem watches the relationship between Haitora and Uzoi develop and starts to connect it his and Somali’s. It does not matter that they are not related by blood or even completely different species; Golem and Somali love each other, and that is a reason enough for everything they are doing.<br />
<br />
Golem finally has a deeper understanding of his love for Somali but is still confused about the purpose of his little remaining time. He thinks that he needs to return Somali to her parents before his life comes to end, but in the last arc he realizes that it is more than that. His end goal is not to reunite Somali with other humans but to spend all of his remaining time with her, looking for them. Knowing that his life is coming to its end, Golem struggles with the thought he will inevitably have to leave Somali alone. In the final episode, Golem comes to believe in living beings having souls, something that goes against logic, and his former self would have never even entertained the thought of their existence. By thinking this way, Golem no longer has to leave Somali when he dies, because his soul will stay by her side forever. Golem has finally stopped thinking completely logically and instead emotionally. He finally accepts all the emotions he now feels and no longer denies his own humanity.<br />
<br />
The character arc of Golem is definitely the thing I appreciate the most from Somali to Mori no Kamisama, but it is not even my favorite thing about the show. The animation, more specifically the backgrounds, are absolutely fantastic. The fantasy world the anime presents feels way more fleshed out and detailed than most in the genre. Backgrounds in anime are unfortunately almost always pretty terrible, but the ones in Somali to Mori no Kamisama are always beautiful. Every environment is filled with color and life, especially the wilderness. This is easily one of the best looking shows I have seen in a long time, despite the actual animation being nothing special.<br />
<br />
I probably would have never watched the entirety of Somali to Mori no Kamisama if the backgrounds did not immediately get me on board. I am pretty sure most people do not care about anime backgrounds as much as I do, so I can only assume that a lot of people dropped this show early on. Not because the anime was bad, but because it felt like it would do nothing special. I have seen plenty of anime that focus on the relationship between parent and child (watch Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari for, in my opinion, the best this subgenre has to offer), but most of them seem to not focus on much else. A character dynamic can do very little on its own, it is the characters themselves that will make a show good or bad. People seem to be focusing on the character dynamic between Golem and Somali in the discussion around Somali to Mori no Kamisama far more than they should. This is not just an anime about a father and daughter; this is an anime following someone as they find their humanity.

    Terminator 2 is a story about a young boy name john conne- Sorry I shouldn&#039;t compare this story to something with thought and effort put into it.<br />
 <br />
Somali and the Forest Spirit is by far one of the most painfully stupid anime I&#039;ve watched period. So stupid that I was actually angry that a story this poorly written could be published to any capacity and get a rating above 6.<br />
<br />
With that said not everything I have to say about the show is negative but the majority of it is... So I&#039;ll start off with the positive.  <br />
<br />
The animation and art direction are quite nice

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331399">
        and, depict a stunning world that feels lived in and believable. You can clearly see the level of care that went into designing every environment and they are varied and detailed. Every village legitimately feels like a separate location which is a nice change of pace from your run of the mill fantasy crap. Despite the imagery becoming very fantastical the artists did a good job making everything seem as if it could exist within the world they crafted which is another impressive feat.<br />
<br />
Though the soundtrack isn&#039;t anything phenomenal and neither is the voice acting it&#039;s serviceable and Smoli despite being a child never came off as annoying but I wouldn&#039;t put them on the level fo quality as Gon or Killua or Reg and Riko. <br />
<br />
For the story<br />
 it starts off with enough narrative hooks to keep the viewer invested with an interesting dynamic between the main characters one being an &quot;emotionless&quot; machine and the other child. The former acting as a father figure for the latter. This concept has been done before, but the tender moments of emotion the golem shows to Somali almost work.<br />
<br />
That&#039;s about everything positive I can say for the show.<br />
<br />
But I&#039;m going to backtrack a little.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re never really shown the Golem being consistently emotionless throughout the anime there are parts which he comes off as inconsiderate sometimes even to the extreme but he never really crosses over to machine territory. Which is a problem because it weakens the shows premiss. But the mediocrity wafting off the series like a wet fart from the ass of a Kardashian doesn&#039;t stop there, as bad writing is a force powerful enough to rival faith in god.<br />
<br />
The golem&#039;s changes in character (as limited as they are) are forced, happening nearly spontaneously once another character mentions he&#039;s being a bit of a dick or Somali cries. Then after a brief moment of self-reflection Mr.golem becomes more tender until he starts being insensitive again for virtually no reason other than the plot decided readers needed to see more character drama. This problem could have been avoided if they made the Golem completely emotionless from the start like the terminator and slowly had them grow over the course of the series But, quite frankly that would require a level of writing that wasn&#039;t even present in the manga and Gureishi, Yako isn&#039;t even capable of delivering. <br />
<br />
For Somali, she never once came off as an actual child to me. And instead seemed closer to a character and not a well-written one because she gets over things extraordinary quickly. Someone tries to kill her and she just goes back to being friends with them. It&#039;s as if she&#039;s there to be cute rather than be there to get invested in like Gon in Hunter x hunter. I gave a shit about Gon I never cared about Somali because she&#039;s a prop for the story to bank off of. For people to go &quot;Oh this is so wholesome&quot; or &quot;Oh look how cute she is&quot; or other stupid shit that only makes the story better from a braindead perspective. She never learns from her mistakes and never seems to understand that she&#039;s in mortal danger nearly 24/7 which would be fine but someone already tried to kill her. The golem also insists that she stay by his side for this reason. Children are rebellious, yes but they aren&#039;t completely unreasonable and they aren&#039;t stupid this anime seems to think otherwise, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now when the main premiss fails to fully work as a method to engage the viewer when looked at from a critical standpoint where does that leave us? What does this story do to set itself apart from other stories that have tackled a similar premiss?<br />
<br />
 It has furries take over the world because humans are meany heads. Which brings me to the general patronizing nature of the show&#039;s worldbuilding.<br />
<br />
You are told the history of the world multiple times not through visual storytelling but by characters dumping exposition until episode 8 where you get introduced to a completely unneeded character and informed &quot;No that&#039;s not exactly what happened this is what happened. I know because I was there&quot; this story does nothing but add filler to the worldbuilding something you&#039;ll often see in a Bethesda game. You&#039;re told information that doesn&#039;t necessarily enhance the world and instead only really serves to make it bigger while completely destroying any reason for the previous info dumps exist. But the main problem with this flashback is this singular quote<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans are a frail and cowardly species whenever they encounter a creature that does not conform to their worldview, they can not regain peace of mind until they purge it from existence&quot;<br />
<br />
This one quote perfectly sums up what the series has to say about the human race and the entire flashback. This quote is false from an objective standpoint. Petty and spiteful we are but not cowardly and not genocidal cause &quot;They LOok different than us&quot; throughout history almost every single case of genocide against another race or species has been done for a reason not just because they looked different than us. And the author either seems to not understand history and human nature at all or just intended to demonize humans without taking a look at what we&#039;ve actually done wrong. After all, humans are just all cartoonishly evil on mass with only three out of every 30-40 people having any sense of compassion or basic morality. Which is what the show pushes. The majority is evil, irrational, and bloodthirsty. Which is a world you can build you just have to have a fucking reason for the humans to be like that in the show. You can&#039;t just have that be their default because that&#039;s not how people work. <br />
<br />
So I&#039;m going to summarize the review so far.<br />
<br />
The dynamic between the main characters and the evolution of the golems character feels rushed if not forced and fails to work, to begin with, due to the Golem clearly already having emotions and his &quot;moments of growth as a human&quot; I should say seem to not really affect his overall behavior. Somali isn&#039;t worth investing in as a character because she&#039;s almost purely reactive. And isn&#039;t really much of a character outside of &quot;Little girl&quot; and that&#039;s it. The characters lack a general layer to them to have them approach the level of humanism you see in Dorohadoro or Castlevania leading the slice of life aspect falling a bit flat. Character conflicts never really feel like they approach naturally. The series, in General, lacks any sense of tension which is a massive missed opportunity.<br />
<br />
In short, though the series had a relatively untouched premiss and had the potential to become great, it generally falls short from a narrative perspective as there&#039;s no sensation of moving forward to the goal the characters are seeking. <br />
<br />
The dialog isn&#039;t dynamic enough to get most people invested in the personalities of the characters that are shown. And very few of them are actually striking, the majority mostly consisting of a handful of traits rather than a fully fleshed-out personality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Condescending and poor worldbuilding that demonstrates a distinct lack of care or thought. Along with exposition that has no real reason to exist...<br />
<br />
Characters that serve no real purpose other than to just introduce a contrived and poorly thought out conflict *cough* Uzoi  *cough cough* or to dump information about the world which as mentioned before isn&#039;t even worth looking into.<br />
<br />
But most of all the pacing of the story is horrible, with vast swaths of progress made but never feeling like a triumph. It generally feels like you&#039;re watching a journey for the sake of having one rather than a race against the clock which would be fine. But the main Duo isn&#039;t interesting enough to carry that type of story and it was already established that they do have a time limit.<br />
 <br />
In the end, I can say for a fact that the anime is better than the manga but that&#039;s not a very high bar to leap over...<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixed some grammatical errors.

    A very heartfelt story with amazing visuals, and captivating character designs, and a world that keeps on expanding, if you&#039;re a fan of series like Made in Abyss or Mahoutsukai no Yome, then you&#039;re even more sure to love this one.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
<br />
Seeing how the series revolves around Somali and her travels together with Golem, you can expect to meet lots of different characters, in various types of environments, and the journey is full of emotion, and suspense, and a looming sense of despair. Despite the overall cute appearance of this show, don&#039;t let it deceive you, it&#039;s out to rip your heart straight out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327887">
        your chest. Although, sadly some of the better world-building scenes from the manga were cut out, I had to bump the Story rating down to an 8, but it is still very enjoyable, and a great adaptation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Art: 10  <br />
<br />
My favorite thing about the anime adaptation so far, the background artwork, and the scenery, the visuals are absolutely stunning and even breathtaking at times. Major props to Chiho Nakamura who did Color Design (also did color design for Youjo Senki) and Vincent Nghiem (Background Art Director, debut)<br />
Vincent especially, he put a ton of effort in the backgrounds, which absolutely helped this anime stand out. Considering the manga&#039;s gorgeous artwork that they had to live up to, they did an outstanding job in delivering and surpassing my expectations.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
<br />
The soundtrack is so good, I honestly can&#039;t wait for its release. It helps give so much more emotional impact to certain scenes, and don&#039;t even get me started on the OP and ED.<br />
<br />
Character: 9<br />
<br />
There is a wide variety of types of characters, all sorts of different races and species, and you slowly get introduced to more and more, and it helps build up the world very nicely. Some allies, and some foes, there is a really solid cast and even recurring characters outside the main two. The character designs themselves are very well done, even the background characters with zero significance have great levels of uniqueness to them.  <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10  <br />
<br />
There&#039;s just something super captivating about seeing these characters come to life. I firmly believe that everyone who has read the manga can still thoroughly enjoy what the anime has to offer, and vice versa. They each have their own benefits and strengths. Some scenes are cut out in the anime, and some orders of events are even rearranged, but I don&#039;t think it detracts from the show at all. In fact, some things even flow together nicer in the anime than they do in the manga. A very enjoyable watch, and definitely one of my favorites of the Winter 2020 season.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9  <br />
<br />
I highly recommend watching it. You will not regret it, this anime is an emotional roller-coaster, even just 4 episodes in, it already has some heavy heart-hitting scenes that could make a grown man cry. A solid adaptation of one of my favorite manga, and I firmly believe that both can be enjoyed equally, with or without the other.  <br />
This anime is gonna be one of those ones that we look back on years from now and remember very, very fondly.

    This is honestly the best anime of this season for me. I look forward to it each and every week. Here is why!<br />
<br />
The opening is just so peaceful. It&#039;s the kind of tone that&#039;s relaxing and great honestly. A opening I could listen to for hours. But that goes for the show too! The way the show presents itself, it&#039;s charming, peaceful, beautiful. All of the above. From not just the sound, the story, the characters, but it&#039;s art too. It&#039;s really beautiful.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the story, I honestly feel tears are going to be flowing down my face by the end of this with what

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327877">
        it has built up so far. It&#039;s a real heart warming story, and Somali herself is just a blessing, and a treasure. She&#039;s a wonderful character with how upbeat, bright and so energetic she is, and the golem himself, is a real great dad. I wish the best for the both of them. But there is more than just the characters.<br />
<br />
The whole world that they have set up is just interesting in general, and makes you wonder what else is within this world. With it being mostly populated by creatures. <br />
<br />
Overall Somali is a must watch for this season for sure!

    Somali to Mori no Kamisama has a love to exercise its genres by perfecting storytelling through its world of beauty. This is the type of show you get when a creator not only wants you to experience their fantasy world but also be part of it. Somali to Mori no Kamisama (Somali and the Forest Spirit) is the anime adaptation of the same name that made me believe Fantasy-Drama shows in this decade can still work wonderfully with the right set of tools.<br />
<br />
Once you’re thrown into the Forest Spirit world, it’s easy to get lost in its spellbinding aura. The mystifying backgrounds will suck you

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332944">
        in as every picture frame looks like it’s carved with painted art. You ever been to one of those science exploratoriums before where everything around you look surreal? That’s the sort of impression I got the first time my eyes saw that forest. It’s one of the charms of a fantasy show where the creator can inject all sorts of their creative ideas and craft its setting as imaginative as it can be. However, an anime like this must also have the ability to balance its world fiction with its character cast. Given its small roster, it needed to go extra miles to make us, the viewers, feel invested. In the end, it needs to capture the essence of a character relationship and doesn’t make us forget them. Thankfully, Somali to Mori no Kamisama achieves that.<br />
<br />
Meet Somali and Golem. They are the heart and soul of the show. Like gadgets of a machine, this anime cannot operate without an important relationship. The story binds these two characters together and as contrasting as they are, Somali and Golem portrays the type of relationship that truly works. It isn’t easy at first because the show has to balance out a tricky way of showing the characters’ personalities. From the start, Somali is the innocent human girl we meet in a world dominated by monsters. In this human racial era, a vulnerable small girl like her is exceptionally easy to fall prey to any element. Then, she meets Golem, an entity swore to protect the forest he lives in. As a Golem, he lacks real emotions and serves more as a guardian of the forest. However, it doesn’t take long for Somali to declare him as her father and thus begins their complex relationship and a fantasy-drama adventure in this monster-ridden world. To elaborate, this show isn’t about the pair having any sort of specific goal in their adventure. They’re not trying to reach a certain designation or defeat some ancient demon king. No, Somali to Mori no Kamisama works as both a drama and slice of life. Every day brings out a new challenge for the main characters whether it’s dealing with human prejudice or surviving in the untamed wilderness. The key to unlocking this show’s enjoyment is to embrace the relationship of Somali and Golem. As you follow their adventure, there will be many questions that may not have the right answers. The show wants you to decide the true purpose of their adventure.<br />
<br />
And during their adventure, Somali and Golem encounter new allies, foes, and challenges. The show preaches to fantasy genres where pretty much every character they encounter is a non-human. Some of these characters have their own personal problems that gets the pair entangled into their own stories. Meanwhile, you can bet the show wanted us to see how much Golem can change and while it doesn’t explicitly happen, there’s windows of character personality evolution we can see when he interacts with Somali. In essence, Golem shows more human emotions towards Somali than to any other character. While he may not truly be Somali’s father, he adopts a guardianship role to protect her in their adventures. Somali’s friendly and innocent personality allows her easy to make friends with although she must always hide her human nature. In one particular compilation, her life is put into danger when a harpy tried to kill her for a specific purpose. It reinforces the idea that the world they’re in is no safe haven for a child. However, Somali’s way of resolving conflicts using words rather than power shows that humans are not what they are assumed to be. In fact, given the state of their world, humans are a misunderstood race and others such as the witch Hazel wants to understand them. Meanwhile, Somali continues to adapt in living with courage and attachment to his new guardian. She makes friends such as Shizuno and his assistant, Yabashira. And the more characters she meets, the more courage she finds in herself to live. Because if one thing this show taught us, it’s that the hardest thing in their world is to live in it.<br />
<br />
But as unorthodox as the show may seem, it still follows traditional fantasy elements such as exploring and adventuring. An anime like this takes advantages of its world fiction concepts by expanding its settings such as the Anthole City and Witch Crest Library. Many of the locals in these places takes on human-like roles such as innkeepers or researchers. It feels like exploring an open world game but with only one life and no pause menu. But with Somali to Mori no Mamisama, it prioritizes more character relationships and daily life challenges than completing quests or conquest. Somali and Golem has voice actors that are perfectly suited for their roles. Their vastly different voice mannerisms remains true to their character personalities from start to finish. The emotive expressions draws the line between human and monster, a unique trait I’m sure fans shouldn’t easily overlook.<br />
<br />
When I first watched Somali to Mori no Kamisama, it felt like being in a Xenoblade-like world where the photography and everything around you looked like it came from a high fantasy video game. Once I got attached to our main characters, it became so much more than exploring the monster world. Somali and Golem together managed to show that such an unorthodox pair can co-exist together. As someone who has read parts of the manga, this show also has a simple pacing woven into a precise 12-episode adaptation. It works so well that it doesn’t truly need to be one of those long-running franchises that never seemingly has an end. So should you recommend this anime to your friend, family, neighbor, co-worker, stranger, or your dog? Absolutely.

    Somali to Mori no Kamisama  could have been pretty good fantasy version of &quot;Lone dude takes care of small child&quot; troupe but it is let down by poor writing and lazy world building.<br />
<br />
See this type of shows largely bank on viewers  to feel empathy and affection towards cute defenseless child. So wherever or not  you will enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Reason this show failed to captivate me was becuase it  writing was shallow , it  just did bare minimum to check all &quot;Small child, scary world&quot; boxes. <br />
<br />
1. Characters are horribly written. Somali isn&#039;t much of character, just an object viewers to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review334026">
        adore over, see Rin from Usagi drop and Girls fron Hinamatsuri were also adorable but they were well written. They had goals, insecurities ,passions and hopes. While all Somali has is that she is small child and cute, she goes from some one viewer should  get attached to but end ups  being disliked and irritating due how hollow she is. Second Character Golem isn&#039;t any better if not worse, writers try to actually flesh out Golem  but end up failing as Golem&#039;s thoughts and action often contradict with reality, so instead of being objectively thinking he comes off as ignorant . Example of this happens as early as 3rd episode, it is stated that Golem unable to feel emotion yet says that he felt pain around his chest when he saw Somali crying, yet keeps on denying that he can feel emotions.<br />
 Either writers couldn&#039;t fine way to grow Golem as character with out emotions or didn&#039;t plan ahead, so premise of emotionless golem is poorly executed or thought out.<br />
With Somali who is a lifeless doll and Golem being teenager in denial  an interactions they have lose all impact, making changes in their relationship or characters forced and unnatural.<br />
<br />
2. Well with mediocre central characters,  what could have made show semi good to watch would its world building but judging by attitude of this review its clear that its not.  Here is how first world building is done:<br />
Golem- I am looking for humans<br />
Monster A- humans? i have not seen them for such long time<br />
Monster B- hey, I forgot what happened to humans , could you tell me the story  of why humans are are so rare?<br />
Monster C- uhh, *looks at camera*  *proceeds to give few minutes long exposition dump*<br />
<br />
when this happened I was convinced that show was being self aware but nope  same happens over and over in the show, minutes long exposition.<br />
<br />
Even that aside fantasy aspect only seems to be a reskin so that show fits in with current Isekai trends. Only thing it does is to make Somali look extra precious since humans are rare.<br />
<br />
Art style is pretty standard,  show is colorful with its environments and monsters but its not something worth watching show over.<br />
<br />
Same goes for sound tracks. they were adequate but not enough to be remembered on their own and  <br />
since they accompanied overall poorly written show, there aren&#039;t scenes or moments to associate with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Somali to Mori no Kamisama is low effort, piss poor of a show, there are shows who do father daughter relationship better or do better job setting up interesting and captivating fantasy world.<br />

    Introduction:<br />
• Somali to Mori no Kamisama is an emotional and adventurous anime that stems off of a wholesome premise, the bond between parent and child. Throughout the anime we are exposed to various themes such as loss, discrimination, and bonding.<br />
<br />
Story (7):<br />
• The story is focused on our two travelers, Somali and the Golem. Due to certain circumstances, the Golem is watching over Somali as her father figure while they search for her real parents. A premise that is not very unique on it&#039;s own but is enhanced by the odd combination of human and golem.<br />
• As mentioned, Somali is a human in a world filled

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327882">
        with various sentient creatures and plant life. The challenge she faces is one beginning from ancient times, the food chain. Humans were both distrusted and highly sought after for their meat resulting in their near extinction. This poses an actual threat in this anime and spices things up. You are constantly worried that her identity will be discovered which will result in her being hunted down.<br />
• In addition, you have a ticking time bomb to this story. The Golem only has a limited time left to live and has to fulfill his mission. This creates a lot of emotional strife and cements itself as the main obstacle for the anime. Will they have to part ways?<br />
<br />
Art (9):<br />
• My favorite aspect and a part of what makes this anime so special. The art is simply eye candy. Vibrant, dreamlike, and unique are a few words that come to mind. If nothing else, the art alone will captivate you.<br />
<br />
Sound (8):<br />
• Both the opening and ending are distinguishable and well made. They put you in a state of relaxation, perfect for the type of theme this anime goes for.<br />
• The OSTs also sound good and fit the situation at hand. Nothing so far has stood out in particular, but similarly to the opening and ending, the OSTs have a dreamlike and relaxing vibe to them.<br />
<br />
Characters (7):<br />
• As of this point we have been introduced to a few side characters. Aside from the obvious traveling duo, we have the people they meet along the way. They tend to aid in strengthening the bond between the duo and slowly changing the Golems outlook on life.<br />
• The main duo are definitely interesting and contrast one another. The Golem strict and emotionless is the opposite of Somali, carefree and energetic. It is nice to see how they interact with one another and observe the bond they have deepening. On the other hand, the side characters aren&#039;t very memorable but still get the job done. Not much depth to them, backstory, or personality.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (8):<br />
• Even though I tend to not particularly care much for relaxing adventure anime, I find myself excited to watch this every week.<br />
• I can say my favorite aspects are definitely the art and the unique combination of main characters.<br />
<br />
Overall (7):<br />
• For now I will leave this show at a 7 even though I personally give it an 8. Nothing major has yet to happen in the story and the side characters have been a little weak. I do expect this rating to change as the series ends since it will have to tackle the fact that the Golem is dying. This moment will either make or break the anime. If done well, I will definitely increase the rating to an 8.<br />
• I recommend this anime to fans of adventure, slice of life, fantasy, and drama. You will find yourself relaxing and being in awe of the art. If you are expecting a lot of action or a completely wholesome anime, you will be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
• Definitely a good seasonal anime that is worth watching. It has a memorable art style and has the potential to be a stand out of this season.

    Somali and the Forest Spirit is a show that takes a familiar premise and executes it in a familiar (and slightly uninspired) way. The formula of an emotionally distant person being thrust into the role of father-figure and learning to adapt along the way can be an emotionally gripping one, if it’s told with care. Somali and the Forest Spirit adds a ticking-clock element and fantastical world to create a nice inoffensive story about parenthood.<br />
<br />
To begin with positives, the art style of this show is beautiful. Each environment has a sort of watercolor aesthetic to it, making for rich backgrounds that compliment the wonderful character

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333596">
        designs. While the animation is rarely impressive, it gets the job done without common mistakes—like characters being off-model. On all technical fronts, this show is solid.<br />
<br />
The problems lie with the structure of the story. We’re introduced to our two main characters, and immediately there is an inseparable, unbreakable bond between Somali and the forest golem. Any real child would be immediately terrified of this scary skull-faced monster, but not Somali. The forest golem at least realistically takes some time to warm up to Somali, but the growth of the relationship is presented in one flashback in one episode towards the end of the show. In a well-told version of this story, Somali and the golem would get off to a rocky start, but over time grow to love each other, and we as the audience would be shown this progression.<br />
<br />
Our two main characters are also fairly flat. Somali has one personality trait: she’s a genki kid. The forest golem has one personality trait: he’s a stoic automaton—even his face is deliberately designed to be expressionless. It’s very difficult to buy into the depth of their relationship when the characters themselves are so simple. Maybe in future installations of this series their relationship and personalities will be explored, but since the first season of this show is all that’s complete, we have to judge it as a standalone work.<br />
<br />
Overall, your enjoyment of this show will depend on how much you’re able to buy into Somali and the golem’s father-daughter relationship. If the show manages to grab your heartstrings in the first few episodes, it’ll be a win for you. Otherwise, consider it safe to skip.

    Somali to Mori no Kamisama - Somali and The Forest Spirit.<br />
<br />
THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THE CHARACTER SECTION.<br />
<br />
If, by any means you&#039;re reading this and haven&#039;t seen the anime yet, here&#039;s my conclusion: it is cute, it is beautiful, definitely, so if that&#039;s what you like, serve yourself, is shows plenty of cute and a cute father-daughter relationship, but you shouldn&#039;t expect much more than that.<br />
<br />
This is a review from someone who didn&#039;t enjoy nor like much of this show, therefore, expect a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Story (6)<br />
In a fantasy world, we follow the story of a child and a father, well, that might be a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333149">
        good dynamic, right? And it is. If only it could be backed up by good writing.<br />
<br />
Somali is a human girl on a world full of humanoid animals/beasts called the Grotesque, who happen to eat humans. Somali escapes them and comes across a Golem, a guardian of the forest, that decides to help her. They depart on a journey to reunite Somali, properly disguised, with her own species.<br />
<br />
Art (9)<br />
The art is one of the selling points of this series, it is unique and feels good.<br />
It works well to the world building, every new place is different, carries it&#039;s beauty and it&#039;s danger, which makes you look forward to the journey.<br />
Oh, if only this could be backed up by good writing.<br />
<br />
Sound (7) <br />
Believe me I am not the person who can talk about sound, but I can discern between extremelly good or extremelly bad. This show&#039;s sound was neither, hence the 7, it did it&#039;s work.<br />
<br />
Character (9)<br />
The two main characters are the best we get, and they&#039;re pretty good at first glance.<br />
<br />
-The father-<br />
The Golem is by far the most interesting one, being basically a force of nature with the mission to guard a forest, who acts as logically as possible and seems to have no emotion nor the ability to understand it. He&#039;s the one who grows. He is the force that keeps this anime going till the last episode, you&#039;ll love him.<br />
<br />
-The daughter-<br />
Somali is also interesting, a human child who somehow escaped the Grotesque and came across a Golem that decided he would help her.<br />
At first, Somali does the job of a child pretty well, being cute and not being annoying, and, more importantly, she loves her (new) father, the Golem. <br />
<br />
All is fine until the second half of the series, Somali never grows as a character, &quot;but she&#039;s a child&quot;, well, children do learn, Somali doesn&#039;t. <br />
Somali faces a lot of challenges throughout the story, at times, showing of her childish behavior at it&#039;s best, other times, after facing a bad time, she seems like a grown up and fully developed character, which isn&#039;t the case.<br />
<br />
-The sidecharacters-<br />
As the main characters travel, they make friends along the way, face some danger and depart.<br />
The supporting cast is not bad, but they feel a lot like they&#039;re disposable and too bland.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (6)<br />
<br />
And here&#039;s the problem, FOR ME. The father and daughter&#039;s journey can be enough for many people, it wasn&#039;t for me.<br />
Every other episode seems almost pointless, to the point of boredon since it&#039;s either an episode just for the cute scenes or for a danger as unpaupable, bland  and cheap as possible.<br />
<br />
Overall (6)<br />
<br />
One of the big points of this shows should be, and it is for most people, the world building. I disagree. All we know at the start is that this is a fantasy world where human beings have been eaten by the Grotesque, so Somali is in constant danger. Nothing wrong with that. What is wrong, however, is that we continue to see beautiful places and the daily life of the Grotesque and the main characters... repeatedly, with little to no change, and for me that doesn&#039;t make for a good world building.<br />
<br />
The show focuses on the relationship of both main characters, from episode one Somali shows to be attached enough to her new father, there isn&#039;t much room for growth (the Golem is the only one that grows).<br />
<br />
That&#039;s going to be all, I won&#039;t tackle all of it, and I doubt I would be capable of doing so. My opinion was stated at the begging of this review. I had high expectations for this show, my overall is 6/10.<br />

    Frankly I watched this show, because the opening song was so perfect.  The staccato notes perfectly encapsulate the childlike wonder, and the 2 main characters&#039; whole backstory and emotional connection is conveyed.  And lets be real, the art is gorgeous.  I have been perfectly primed to feel that gentle sense of wonder and exploration.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the show fails to deliver this, and its failures pile upon themselves making the show worse and worse as it progresses.<br />
<br />
I have 3 big problems with Somali to Mori no Kamisama:  <br />
1) The premise of the show is supposed to be machine-dad-learns-to-have-feelings, but instead we get the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review335797">
        Status-quo-is-god trope.<br />
2) The characters are flat, inconsistent, and solely exist to push forward the next scene.<br />
3) I haven&#039;t seen this much unfocused, unnecessary, unprovoked exposition dumping EVER. <br />
<br />
Character growth doesn&#039;t exist. What little we get is cute in the moment but is immediately forgotten next episode.  The premise of the show is that the golem dad is effectively an unfeeling machine, but from the very beginning of the first episode he has shown how deeply he cares for Somali.  So much for gradual growth, instead we just get a guy in denial who has to relearn the same emotional truths every arc.<br />
<br />
Somali does not make this better.  Frankly an optimistically adventurous character like her, surrounded by a world that actively wants her dead, just doesn&#039;t make sense.  Somali just continues to ignore all safety advice from her dad, and blithely wander into trouble.  Once one of the many iterations of villains (who try to KILL her) strike, she immediately forgives and forgets.  This show seems to believe children have emotional short term memory loss.<br />
Somali is nothing more than a prop for other characters to lean on, but this merely emphasizes the lack of other characters.<br />
<br />
Within the first 2 episodes, almost half the alotted time is random exposition.  The characters explaining why demon world came to be have no reason to explain this, no audience that wants it explained to them, and WORST OF ALL explain the world in a boring and incoherent way.  Good world building should be like the intro song: I learned everything i needed to know about the premise of the main relationship just from watching, and moreover i enjoyed it.  You&#039;d think that after the first 2 episodes, they&#039;d have dumped all the exposition they needed and could get a move on, but it just never stops. <br />
<br />
From a shallow book-cover/trailer review, this show has all the elements it needs to get you hyped.  A discerning viewer will quickly find themselves bored and looking to skip forward to the good parts, but will never find them.<br />
<br />

    &quot;So what did you do on the first day of April?&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched a show about some living rock and a loli. <br />
<br />
Story : 10/10 <br />
<br />
This show is hands down the saddest anime of Winter 2020. It resolves around a golem and a loli  adventuring together with the goal to find humans. <br />
<br />
Art : 10/10 <br />
<br />
For a studio that made Fairy Tail.. I am quite impressed that they pulled this off. <br />
<br />
Sound : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Chill. Very chill. One problem is Somali&#039;s voice but all kids voice are slightly retarded so that won&#039;t count as a con. <br />
<br />
Character : 10/10 <br />
<br />
The golem undergoes Violet Evergarden&#039;s empathy

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333919">
        route but dad DLC and the loli acts as an actual loli that&#039;s not exaggerated. This anime overall reminds me of Made in Abyss a little, but not as dark. <br />
<br />
One problem is the loli being an actual loli. The closer the loli is to reality loli the more retarded it becomes. Not saying that it&#039;s a bad thing. It&#039;s just inevitable. Still, I think I&#039;ll let this pass since she&#039;s actually pretty kawaii and I like her overall. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment : 10/10 <br />
<br />
I cried a lot. I also had fun. The climax was so dad being overprotective and I love it. <br />
<br />
Overall : 10/10 <br />
<br />
Maybe the best anime of Winter 2020? Hmm. Don&#039;t really know, but what&#039;s for sure is that this anime is a masterpiece! <br />
<br />
Recommended to all.

    I never watch something so beautiful<br />
<br />
A pure bond between father and daughter from a different race<br />
Beautiful Art, sound, and the character design<br />
<br />
a Golem can turn to be a protective father and understand a human feeling<br />
a human and other race can befriend <br />
<br />
I love the opening and ending song, I love the art and coloring, and the voice actors are just perfectly fit their roles<br />
<br />
I love the character design especially Somali, a little girl with short black hair and orange eyes<br />
<br />
I recommend this for anyone looking for a wholesome anime<br />
<br />
never thought a relationship between Golem and a little girl can make me cry, laugh, happy, and

    I never write reviews but I just had to say something. This show feels seriously underrated right now and it&#039;s honestly such a special and enjoyable little series that it needs more attention. <br />
<br />
If you enjoy stuff like Made in Abyss, Magus Bride or enjoy anime with good heartwarming parenting themes this is definitely something you should check out.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve only seen 4 episodes so far so I can&#039;t say much but if the quality stays the same throughout this is easily anime of the season material.<br />
<br />
Art and music wise so far has been great as well, there&#039;s a lot of variation with the character designs

    So, this anime follows Somali, a little girl who finds herself in a forest and is taken in by the forest&#039;s guardian, who is a golem. Consequently, the Golem takes Somali on a journey in search of other humans and in the process discovers what it is to have a heart and emotions. The Golem takes care of Somali as a father and the two develop a touching relationship.The world of Somali to Mori is one in which humans are almost extinct and they are also prey to the other spicies that occupy the world. Due to this, Somali&#039;s journey with the Golem is fraught

          <span style="display: none;" id="review336270">
        with danger and her identity as a human has to be kept a secret.<br />
<br />
So, how well does the anime do? To be honest, I found the pacing to be lacking and I didn&#039;t enjoy the show for the longest time. This is partly because the plot was straightforward, which can be good sometimes, but in this case was pretty boring as the other elements didn&#039;t match up. <br />
<br />
For instance, a show like Amaama to Inazuma also has a weak plot but gets by on the strength of Tsumugi&#039;s sweetness and her force of character was enough to make the show decent. However, this was not the case with this show and while I quite liked both the Golem and Somali, it wasn&#039;t enough to make their story intriguing.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the world wasn&#039;t as interesting to me as each town kinda felt the same. This is in contrast to a show like Kino no Tabi in which the protagonist also traveled around a lot, while that show had different towns and villages with odd quirks that made them so interesting, this show didn&#039;t give me enough of that. With that said, Somali to Mori shines in its themes of parenthood and hatred. The conflict between humans and other creatures and the cycle of hate it created was well represented and it taught some very poignant lessons on hate, the causes of it, and the destructiveness it brings. I also liked the animation and art. Also, the character development was impressive and the last few episodes were quite emotional. In conclusion, this wasn&#039;t that great a show, but its treatment of its themes was impressive and for that reason it will certainly be memorable. Should you watch it? Only if you really enjoy slice of life and cute depictions of parents and children.

    Somali was too darn sweet and comfy for its own good. There&#039;s something that draws me into these stories of &quot;things that typically don&#039;t have emotions develop feelings for a human being&quot;. Without further ado, here&#039;s my review (yay first of 2020!) of Somali and the Forest Spirit.<br />
<br />
<br />
The story of this particular series is absolutely nothing revolutionary, but it doesn&#039;t need to be. The whole thing is pertaining to the adventure and growth of the two main leads: Somali and Golem. Along the way we get to see these two grow together and watch Golem develop a soft spot for a small, abandoned girl that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332993">
        he named, Somali. Along the way, we are treated to lush, vibrant towns full of ogres, witches, rabbits, you name them. Throughout these towns we get a brief view of their lives while Golem is trying to find information on human beings in search for a way to find Somali&#039;s parents. These setting are quaint and very effective for building up a lore. The only problem with it, is with it only being a 12 episode series we didn&#039;t get much info on how these towns were started and how they were effected by the constant conflicts with the humans the creatures practically wiped out. <br />
<br />
<br />
The art is quite possibly the biggest standout of Somali. The backgrounds look spectacular and the characters seem to be moving around high quality paintings. The colors are very bright and bring a breath of life to the world. It seethes fantasy aesthetic to a T. The main cast all looks distinguishable, the creatures all looks unique and the towns look like they came right out of your comfy country fantasy. The animation of isn&#039;t the most amazing thing in the world, but the overall art more than makes up for it since after all, this series is mostly focused around narrative, not action. <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, Somali and the Forest Spirit was a enjoyable show to watch and was very helpful in relieving some stress due to its absolute c o m f y n e s s.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros: very heartwarming premise, amazing backgrounds<br />
<br />
Cons: could use more fleshing out with its world building<br />
<br />
For recommendations go for: Made in Abyss and The Ancient Magus Bride<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you again to everyone who reads my reviews, despite this one being on the bit shorter side (to be fair I feel like this is one of the more needed to be experienced than talk about series due to its nature but w/e). Hopefully this review helped you guys out.

    Somali really arrived out of nowhere and became one of my fave shows of winter 2020.<br />
<br />
I’m a sucker for well written, wholesome and cute shows and that’s what somali was through and through. The story of a girl abandoned in the forest who’s adopted by a “golem” and travels with him across the world seeking answers for humanity’s disappearance. <br />
<br />
From a narrative perspective, the show focuses on golem’s emotional development. Initally like his name suggests, he is unable to understand human emotions. Through his meeting and bonding with Somali, Golem slowly becomes more and more human and learns what it means to be a parent.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332953">
        Their jobs , friends and activities that they come across on their travels force both of them to grow and confront reality in a very beautiful way. Every single character that comes into the story does so in a meaningful way and adds to the experience.<br />
<br />
The show also does a really good job of dealing with topics like racism and prejudice. In the world of Somali, humans are severely discriminated against. Over the course of the series, new characters who are introduced gradually come to learn that there is very little difference between humans and their species.<br />
<br />
In addition to the well written story and great character development, the show features an absolutely stunning artistic direction. I mean that in the truest sense. The art is extremely bright and colourful and adds a lot to the overall vibe of the series. This isn’t a battle shonen, so the animation isn’t anything amazing, but it more than gets the job done. The voice acting performances from Somali’s seiyuu also deserves praise.<br />
<br />
In closing, Somali will go down as a criminally underrated masterpiece which successful tells a beautiful story about a father and his daughter gradually learning to understand each other. If you’re a parent, looking for a fresh and original anime, or just want a good story to pass the time, this is your show.<br />
 Somali gets 10 golems out of 10 for me.
