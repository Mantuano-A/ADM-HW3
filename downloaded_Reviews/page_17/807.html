    With all the negative news about the coronavirus going on this year, I figured there’s bound to be at least one or more shows to relax and indulge myself in. When I saw the English version of the title, it reminded me that people have been hoarding toilet paper. But upon finishing this supernatural gem, I found myself eager for more. Sometimes in life there comes a surprise that hits you out of nowhere. Sometimes, there’s a show out there that doesn’t seem what meets the eye. And to say that in a positive light, it’s something we need about now.<br />
<br />
Based on the manga of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332916">
        the same name, Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun is a supernatural school story detailing events at Kamome Academy, a school shrouded by seven mysteries. Among these mystery is about an entity named Hanako, where a rumor goes around that they will grant a wish for the right price. A plot twist reveals that Hanako is actually a boy after being summoned by a girl named Nene Yashiro. And that’s not all. She becomes his personal assistant! Sounds like a strange character duo paired up together, right?<br />
<br />
That’s because Hanako is a social animal, the type with a curiosity around the world and loves being mischievous. Like a prankster, he often sees situation as games for fun but does grow serious under circumstances when needed. For what he represents, Hanako is essentially the supernatural poster boy of the anime. This is somewhat in contrast to Nene, a sweet natured girl who is unaware of the true nature of the outside world. Like most teenage girls of her age, she wants a boyfriend and is one of the main reasons why she took the chance to summon Hanako in the first place – to wish for her feelings to be returned by her crush. However, this anime does not tailor to a romantic comedy but instead takes on the path of a supernatural adventure. Each episode reveals more mystery and fictional lore about the school and hidden truths. What started as a ‘be careful what you wish for’ soon becomes a maze warped with strange abnormalities.<br />
<br />
A curious question revolves around what you should really expect from the character cast. To be frank, the characters are what collectively carries the anime together. Sure, the plot itself has a lot of potential with the various arcs but it’s the characters that plays out their roles. Obviously, you have Hanako and Nene together as the main pair and the amount of development we see is evident from the beginning. As time goes on, Hanako begins to truly care for Nene and isn’t hesitant to resort to violence to protect her. Similarly, Nene’s fragile shell begins to open up the more she experiences her newfound life with Hanako. It’s a type of character bonding that naturally plays out by itself and very simple to understand. They’re not the only ones hoarding the attention either as we also have Kou Minamoto, another student that becomes an ally and friend to Hanako and Nene. Being somewhat airheaded, Kou exemplifies the personality of a teenager of his age and sometimes gets himself into trouble. That doesn’t stop him from taking risks to help others and showing acts of courage. Other cast in the series possesses a wide range of personalities such as the unpredictable Mitsuba, popular Aoi Akane, or prideful Sakura Nanamine. They fall short compared to the main cast but still gets enough screen time to be worthy of being watched.<br />
<br />
Divided into story arcs, the show typically follows each volume entangled with some of the various supernatural gimmicks of the premise. Most of them deals with the seven mysteries at school but sometimes, we also discover hidden truths from what you’d least expected. But because it’s composed of just 12 episodes, I knew the directors had to omit some content. It doesn’t negate the enjoyable of the series altogether but it’s still an unfortunate reality to accept with a pace of 12 episodes. Fortunately, the anime’s overall comedy excels at delivering quality character chemistry. Every expression has charisma and isn’t shy to be overdramatic. Character gags is also evident especially with the main cast by showing how they react to different situations. It’s easy to fall in love with the humor of the show when every episode does its best to entertain the audience.<br />
<br />
One of the show’s trademarks is the unique style of the artwork. It pays tribute to the manga by taking it straight out of its pages and making it come to life. Watching the show feels like jumping right into the anime’s world fiction with its colorful settings. The comic book art-like style is also faithful in adapting the character designs to make them as crisp as possible. By that, I mean the characters look larger than life but enough to be believable for a supernatural comedy. Let’s also not forget the delicate features of Nene and malicious deeds of Hanako. Their actions follows them with the art style every step of the way. And if you ask me, this show has potential to be one of the most eye catchy OP theme songs of the year.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun attracts more of a niche audience but in the modern world today, this is a safe recommendation that I can suggest to anyone. For a supernatural comedy, the show knows its intentions from day 1 and isn’t afraid to be over the top. But at the same time, it’s confident enough to be right where it feels comfortable. If you’re having a stressful day and wants to catch a break, this anime is your remedy. This world needs one right about now.

    Mind me, this is a biased review, so you may not agree with what rating I gave this. Although, I will talk about why this anime, in my eyes, is a masterpiece, so at least take the time to read it.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun seems like a normal comedy show, but when I started watching it, I was amazed. It is actually really funny, but it does have a lot of cool character writing as well. When you see the word &#039;toilet&#039; in the title of an anime you may be inclined to think it&#039;s odd, but this is entirely wrong.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
&#039;Oh, Hanako&#039;s a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332979">
        boy! What a boring plot twist,&#039; is what some people would think. Actually, this isn&#039;t a very important factor in the story, but this does affect Hanako and Yashiro&#039;s relationship, which I will not talk about here. The story is fantastic, as every episode, you learn more about the seven wonders, the character&#039;s personalities, etc. Unfortunately, to say, nearing the end of the 12 episodes, the show fails to give us much more information about Hanako-kun, why he died and other spoilers. Fortunately, though, this isn&#039;t a major flaw, and you&#039;ll still enjoy the story, up until the very end.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Now I think this is a category everyone will agree on. The art was extremely aesthetically pleasing, especially with the way the characters were drawn. Sometimes it looks a bit like manga panels, which I would usually consider bad quality, but it matches the style of this anime perfectly. Another nice addition was the red flowers that appear occasionally on the side, to match the mood.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Every anime has it&#039;s own unique sound effects, regardless of whether the anime is good or not. This show&#039;s soundtrack gave off a mysterious and sad vibe, which perfectly fits in.<br />
The OP was catchy, kind of like a rock song. The ED though was wonderful. There would always be a bittersweet scene at the end of an episode, and the lovely ED would start playing, and it would provide a feeling that doesn&#039;t have you screaming for the next episode but looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
This was the part I was really excited to write, but then I realised it&#039;s really hard to discuss characters without giving spoilers. I&#039;ll try my hardest.<br />
<br />
Hanako-kun could be considered sadistic, but he&#039;s also kind, which is exactly what I like about him. Some anime have a character who&#039;s completely sadistic, which makes them one dimensional. Although not all is revealed about Hanako yet, I believe there may be a second season, so it&#039;ll probably be told by then.<br />
<br />
Yashiro is someone I wouldn&#039;t personally be friends with, but I still think she&#039;s a well-written character. She represents us as humans. She&#039;s desperate to have the status of &#039;girlfriend&#039;, but she doesn&#039;t actually truly love the boys she has had crushes on since she doesn&#039;t even remember their full names. This sounds like a brat, but she isn&#039;t, because she truly works hard to care for people. When she meets Hanako, she does realise some things about love, though.<br />
<br />
Kou is probably a less detailed character. He doesn&#039;t have a particularly obvious personality but we do learn that he ALSO cares for people, so it&#039;s nice to know we have three caring main characters. Kou learns about friendship a bit later in the show, and it&#039;s pretty sad, as well. <br />
<br />
Other characters will not be discussed due to spoilers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
From this review, it&#039;s easy to tell that I enjoyed this anime a lot. It&#039;s obviously not flawless, but I believe that sometimes flaws make an anime more enjoyable, whether that makes sense or not.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I hope Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun is noticed more, as it&#039;s severely under-watched. If you&#039;re reading my review and haven&#039;t watched it yet, go ahead, I can&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll enjoy it as much as I have, but hopefully, this review helped you watch the anime with a hopeful mindset, instead of a negative one, since that ruins the entire anime for me. <br />
<br />
Thank you for reading!<br />

Balancing comedy and drama isn’t easy to do. It can very easily have a negative effect on the story and characters if not handled correctly. Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun is one such example. It’s presented as a fun, light-hearted adventure. But also deals with topics surrounding mental health and goes hard on presenting it with the seriousness it deserves. That is until it abruptly decides to be a comedy again, and throws in some of its titular humor to put you in a good mood. This jarring tonal shift makes everything feel less grounded. As it&#039;s apparent that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332940">
        the slapsticks was put in there because the creators wanted it and not the characters. It’s this forced humor that takes one out of what could’ve been an engaging drama, in service of a cheap laugh. And if the show itself treats it’s heavy topics like a joke, then why shouldn&#039;t the viewer? It&#039;s a shame because the show has a lot more to give.<br />
<br />
The artwork for one is absolutely gorgeous. Beautifully detailed backgrounds filled with a warm color palette emits a feeling of comfort and excitement. The character designs are fun and distinct, and comes to life thanks to the voice acting. Whoever decided to let Megumi Ogata voice Hanako deserves a raise. He&#039;s a fun character to watch which is amplified immensely by Ogata&#039;s acting. The other cast members also delivered a solid performance and had fun with their roles. <br />
<br />
Hanako himself was another saving grace that made the show much more watchable. But I grieve over the fact that they only scratched the surface of his character. Giving the show more time to flesh him out could&#039;ve been very engaging. Sadly, the focus was shifted towards other characters like Nene and Kou instead, who frankly shouldn’t have been main characters at all. <br />
<br />
Their effect on the story is rather minuscule. Nene&#039;s existence revolves around being the exposition dump as well as a damsel in distress for white knight Hanako to rescue. Kou&#039;s purpose being even smaller as he usually just becomes comic relief, which this show already has plenty of. They did set a character arc in motion for him, but that sadly didn&#039;t lead anywhere. With this in mind I think that they should&#039;ve been taken out of the spotlight to instead shine brighter on other characters, like Hanako. The show could&#039;ve been more focused and serious by doing that which at least I would&#039;ve preferred.<br />
<br />
The animation was also a letdown as it’s basically nonexistent most of the time. Still shots take up the majority of each episode, and when it doesn’t it’s stiff and lifeless. It doesn’t take away how good the show still looks, slightly on par with the manga I would presume. But I didn’t exactly watch the adaptation to look at manga panels.<br />
<br />
It was an overall unsatisfying piece of executed potential. By failing at establishing a consistent tone made it hard to get emotionally invested. And due to lack of focus on character development made the experience rather forgettable. It has gorgeous art and solid performances to back it up somewhat. The comedy was also fine at times, but missed more times than it landed for me personally. If you’re still interested then the manga is probably the better alternative. It seems that the adaptation cut out some important parts, so if you want the full experience then go for that instead. The same amount of animation will also be present so that wouldn&#039;t be a problem. But even though the show contains some severe issues it seems to be enjoyed by many still. Give it a go if you want, but I would recommend you flush that thought away.<br />

    No doubt, the thing that probably caught the eye of many of us towards this show was that art style. It looked unique, stylish and intriguing. That is certainly how I felt when seeing this show. Now an anime or manga would use this as a launch point to get people into your world and story that you are trying to tell. What we get a show that carries that unique art style and expands on it into something I didn’t think I would enjoy this much. <br />
<br />
Sit back relax, knock on the bathroom door and say “Hanako-san, Hanako-san, are you there?” As I present

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332965">
        to you the anime review for Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun. Let begin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story: 7.5/10<br />
<br />
Our story begins in Kamome Academy where Nene Yashiro is attempting to summon Hanako-san in order to to grant her a wish despite many trying and failing to summon Hanako-san. However, she manages to successfully summon Hanako-san and wishes Hanako-san to help her with her romantic desires. But, due to some unforeseen circumstances, she is dragged into the world of the supernatural and becomes Hanako-san’s assistant to maintain balance between humans and the apparitions that seem to want to mess with them and disrupt the balance. <br />
<br />
Out the shows this season that deal with supernatural rumours and apparitions (e.g, In/Spectre and Magia record), Hanako-kun probably does it in the most enjoyable and satisfying way on how to deal with the apparitions and how they came to be. Mainly because the world building is really good. How the apparitions take form, how they get stronger or weaker through word of mouth and how they get easily influenced by humanity. The show does as much showing as it does telling us without relying on over-exposition to explain it to us how world of apparitions work. This is especially true with how the “Seven Wonders,” the head apparitions that have taken a foothold in the school, work and how they get their strength as well as their own world in which they manifest. It’s all genuinely interesting and is presented in a way that is both chilling and charming but never at the same time. <br />
<br />
Now the show carries plenty of mystery to it with the apparitions, the Seven Wonders and Hanako-san himself. Are they deep mysteries? Not really. They are more or less self contained mysteries, that exist to help with the world building and character depth, which to be fair, does help out the show quite a bit to help give it that depth that it needs, but it doesn’t help develop this one big narrative that this show is trying to develop with the help of its main antagonists. The focus is clearly on the relationship on Yashiro and Hanako-san and how they work together to stop the apparitions from disrupting the balance. Yet it felt like there was some missed potential to make the situation more dire than it seemed because the threat didn’t feel like the a threat as it was treated like a causal, nonchalant problem that they will eventually solve. <br />
<br />
<br />
Characters: 8.5/10<br />
<br />
Yashiro is what I would describe as a more capable damsel in distress. While she does rely on Hanako-san help save her from other apparitions since she has no way to defend herself, but she does do things that Hanako-san isn’t capable of doing. So she isn’t entirely useless as she does have her uses to make the partnership between Yashiro and Hanako-san more justifiable. But she does make for a good character due to her innocent and caring personality. Although she is full of herself, it’s nice to see a character like her be not a total airhead which they could have clearly done.<br />
<br />
Then there is Hanako-san, a mischievous, childish, s**tsterer who loves nothing more than maintaining balance between worlds and constantly teasing Yahsiro. But there is clear chemistry between the two characters in a way that you actually care for them and hope they ship.  It is one of the main factors why I like this show as they both bring an emotional factor within all the comedic stuff and of course, due to their chemistry, they do have some of the best comedic moments in the show. <br />
<br />
Then there is Kou Minamoto, who has his own arc throughout the show. First and foremost though, he is an exorcist, trained to exorcise all apparitions, but he is a novice at it. So when he encounters Hanako-san, he is a bit shell shocked that not all apparitions are evil. Unlike his older brother Teru, Kou becomes more open minded about what is a good apparition and a bad apparition and we see him grow throughout. It’s not deep character growth but it is enough to be noticeable as we see his character understand the world of apparitions through the eyes of an apparition and how his perception of the world of apparitions changes. The last few episodes is where he truly shines as a character and became very likeable in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Animation: 8/10<br />
<br />
Now here is the most interesting part of the show. The animation for Hanako-kun is very unique with its art style and presentation. So first things first, this art style is GOD DAMN GORGEOUS. I love how this show looks because of that unique feel to it to help give this show its own identity. Everything about the art style works as it also enhances the quality of the show very well. It makes the characters very expressive as you can really get a feel for their emotions, it improves the comedic moments and makes the show’s more thrilling moments that more intense. It makes every scene in this series that more engaging because of its more unique look. Is it perfect though? Not really. The actual animation is lacking as it more or less still images and sliding panels but the show presents it in a way where I can overlook that. It’s not a problem that I will knock the show for, but it’s one of the more lacking areas of the show.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound: 9.5/10<br />
<br />
If the animation enhances the show, then the ost compliments it with tracks that sound haunting and tracks that sound sweet and light hearted. It definitely adds to the mood with violins, pianos and a bit of the banjo to give that youkai feel to it. It gives that extra sense of immersion to it to get you engrossed into what you are watching. Definitely a high point in the show. <br />
<br />
Then there is the opening which I absolutely love. Titled, &quot;No.7&quot; by Jibaku Shounen Band, this really embraces quirky, supernatural side of the show while maintaining the style and presentation  of the show’s animation style. I also love as it slightly sounds angrier as it goes on as you hear the vocals and instruments sounding heavier as it goes on as we get closer to the chorus. Definitely one of the best openings this season. <br />
<br />
The ending, &quot;Tiny Light&quot; by Akari Kitou is very symbolic with Yashiro walking among the living and Hanako-san walking along the world of the dead and supernatural until they meet each other. It’s nothing remotelty complex but it is clever with how some characters are related to the world of the supernatural and is showcased here. Definitely a good ED. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
<br />
You should never judge a show by how it looks and judge it as a whole. Because it’s not just that art style that makes this show enjoyable, it’s how the world is structured and how our characters interact with it and each other. This revelation as it were, lead me to the conclusion that Toilet-bound Hanako-kun is a great supernatural show with plenty of thrills, comedic edge and heart that made me want to continue watching this show throughout. It was much better than I thought it was going to be and the animation was only an enhancer for what we were shown as a whole. It doesn’t rely on over-exposition (unlike In/Spectre) or background knowledge of the franchise to make sense of it (unlike Magia record). So yeah, if you haven’t watched this series already, WATCH IT. <br />
<br />
<br />
My personal enjoyment: 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall score: 8.5/10 Recommendation: Watch it

    Lerche strikes again with a banger<br />
<br />
Wow. This anime is very interesting. The character design in this is weird but cool, all the characters are like chibis. The animation is cool and the opening is a straight up banger. <br />
<br />
Story: It seems there are these legend in Japanese schools called the 7 wonders. All of them are unique and well thought. We mostly focus on the 7th called Hanako-san of the toilet. Weird name right. Hanako grants a wish but it comes with a price. You can find Hanako in the old school buildings toilets and it is the furthest one from the door. Knock few

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327905">
        times and say Hanako-san few times and he appears. So our Protagonist Nene wants to make a certain person to fall in love with her so he goes to find Hanako-San, but her plan fails because Hanako can&#039;t grant such wishes since he is only a novice. So Nene does something very bad and it ends up screwing her. Now Hanako has to save Nene from a very angry mermaid. In every episode we will meet one of the 7 wonders. Well I think some of the fights between wonders will be 2 episodes long like last fight against Misaki of the stairs. After defeating some they have to spread new information about them so they can continue to exist.<br />
<br />
Characters: Nene is a cute but sometimes very dumb girl. She was called Daikon legs few times. She is now basically bound to Hanako-San after being saved. Hanako himself is a very cool character. His powers are weird but he can transform into a stronger being. He uses knives as his weapons. His personality is a bit weird. He likes to tease Nene a lot.<br />
<br />
Do I recommend this? Yeah. It is pretty cool

    I don&#039;t have much to say about it, but I recommend using the urban legend of hanako-san, or rather (similar alternative names in different cultures from different countries) (search), to switch to hanako-kun, as a romantic formula, then it would be totally acceptable, IF it was totally casual, eccentric and peaceful like a novel, but...<br />

Which it isn&#039;t, unfortunately.<br />

At the end of the day, 地縛少年花子くん - honorably, it&#039;s nothing but boring, boring, boring, uncommitted, poorly characterized, with an attempt at shameless, sloppy, despicable humor (which never works, and is obviously very retarded), without a single drop sentimental, it&#039;s dry, empty, anti-dramatic, ANNOYING (again) and it&#039;s only

        saved by its art (which is also literally content that&#039;s certainly been used a lot by yaoi vampire fans), or rather, it&#039;s literally made for this, believe me hahahaha.<br />
<br />
A work without a future, goals, without a sense of beginning, middle and end and totally uncommitted.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. For the next.

    yes, i am very well aware we are only four episodes in, but i still wanna just go ahead and put a review out. this may change if the show surprisingly shows improvement. please note this is only based on my opinions as someone who has already read and loved the manga.<br />
also this pre-review has no spoilers<br />
i hope<br />
<br />
Jibaku Shounen Hanako-Kun is one of my all-time favorite manga. The story, the art, the anticipation scrolling through chapters, it&#039;s amazing. I started reading the manga once I saw Jibaku in seasonals, and thought it may be good to at least understand most of the story before watching

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327921">
        it.<br />
I finished all the recent chapters awhile ago and, again, it was such a good manga.<br />
I figured I might as well start watching the show now to see how it well it could be replicated from the manga...<br />
Boy, was I disappointed.<br />
AGAIN, I understand this is way too soon for a review, but I really need to get this out.<br />
Let&#039;s start with the story.<br />
<br />
[STORY - 10]<br />
Outstanding and, in my opinion, quite an original story (I&#039;m really going by what I&#039;ve seen in the book, so the individuals who haven&#039;t read it may think differently.) I feel like the story, even in the show, is going to still be very good and well written. I only worry that the other categories may bring the story down a tad bit and make me enjoy it less.<br />
<br />
[ART &amp; ANIMATION - 6]<br />
This is one of the categories I&#039;m most disappointed about.<br />
The art style is pretty nice, and quite vibrant.<br />
The animation on the other hand...<br />
sucks.<br />
I was very upset about the animation. Sure, it&#039;s probably quite normal animation for most anime, but to me it&#039;s quite lazy. There aren&#039;t enough frames in most scenes, and I feel there could be far more effort put into most of them.<br />
Now, the art is...mediocre. The art shown in the manga is quite similar, but I felt it had so much potential to be so much better, especially in some scenes. Though, the colors and shading are amazingly done. That was probably the most impressed I was about the art.<br />
<br />
[AUDIO/MUSIC &amp; VA - 6]<br />
Don&#039;t even get me started.<br />
The voice acting is just...awful for some characters.<br />
Now don&#039;t get me wrong, Megumi and Shouya are very talented VA&#039;s, but I don&#039;t think it was a good cast for them in this show.<br />
Yashiro&#039;s VA is well done though, I&#039;ll give it that. But for two very important characters, Hanako and Kou, I just don&#039;t think their voices suit their characters (IN MY OPINION). I also don&#039;t feel like some of the character&#039;s voices go with the scene most of the time, especially with Hanako.<br />
Now, if you think they sound great, then fine, I don&#039;t really care. But I honestly just don&#039;t enjoy it that much.<br />
The sound/music I haven&#039;t payed much attention to, but I can say that I do love the outro.<br />
Some sound effects that I&#039;ve noticed so far are quite well made, too.<br />
But overall, if the audio/music isn&#039;t something I notice, it probably isn&#039;t the best.<br />
If audio stands out so well that I notice it, it&#039;s usually something I&#039;d then enjoy.<br />
But this didn&#039;t hasn&#039;t happen very much for me yet, as you can tell. It just seems quite generic and nothing really that special.<br />
<br />
[CHARACTERS/CHARACTER DESIGN - 9]<br />
One of my favorite parts about Jibaku itself is both the character design and the characters in general.<br />
Each character has its own look to it, which I really love. The characters are quite originally designed, and beautifully made.<br />
I think it&#039;s mostly just the art style and animation that give it sort of a flaw. Either way, good job Aida.<br />
<br />
[ENJOYMENT - 6]<br />
So far, I have been very displeased by the quality of this show.<br />
If this were about the manga, full-on 10/10 right there.<br />
but its not<br />
Hopefully, I will start to enjoy it more. Cause, then again, this is a very early review for this show. It definitely has potential to get better and more entertaining, just as long as all the other stuff gets stepped up.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading this almost-meaningless review. This is my first ever review, so I apologize if it&#039;s a tad confusing. If you have been widely enjoying this show, keep going with that, don&#039;t let this small little review push you back from that. This review could totally be revised and rated higher if this show surprisingly gets better. I&#039;m only putting out a pre-review basically just because I&#039;ve already read the manga.<br />
If you agree with most of my reasoning and you&#039;re only watching the show out of the box, then I highly recommend reading the manga.<br />
And if you just generally haven&#039;t read the manga yet,<br />
please go read it you&#039;re missing out on so much dude<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I&#039;m going to bed now.<br />
<br />
thanks again for stopping by<br />
<br />
come again !<br />

    Introduction: In a medium such as anime where there are vastly varying levels of quality, Toilet-Bound Hanako is ironically a breath of fresh air. Hanako is shaping up to be an extremely good show right out of the gate. <br />
<br />
Sound: First of all the imagery in the opening in and of itself is very meaningful and symbolic. Without going into details too specific, there are a lot of nods to the anime itself that are understood more as you dive into it. The opening song itself is solid, not incredible, but it does have the right tone in my opinion to get excited for the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328785">
        show which is seemingly mostly Shounen style in theme.The ending song is very good however all around. Strangely, both songs have a 30 second or so period before the actual song starts which really takes away from what they would be if simply given the full time. It&#039;s like being given an appetizer in exchange for only two thirds of the main course.  8/10<br />
<br />
Art: The Art style is pretty unique and interesting if you pay attention to it you can see that the background is drawn with far less detail than the characters. This style is done in an attempt to make the characters stand out more as compared to the setting almost akin to a popup book which is quirky and helps it standout. 10/10<br />
<br />
Story: Here is where things are going to get subjective and mucky. There are only 5 episodes at the time of this review, and I have to say, I personally enjoy the story so far. That being said, there are definite slow points to the story and some cliches that have been done to death, but the show never lets you feel the slowness very much. It&#039;s like it comes to the very end of the threshold where things would feel tedious and stops just before it gets there. I think that episode 6 will greatly improve upon the score I give it now as it seems the loose plot threads up to this point will start coming together. 8/10<br />
<br />
Characters: Toilet-Bound Hanako&#039;s greatest strength are it&#039;s loveable characters. They aren&#039;t necessarily the most unique, but their interactions with each other feel extremely lively and special. Each time the characters interact with each other things become a bit more fleshed out with them and given that the show is so early in it&#039;s run I think it&#039;s off to a good start. As far as main characters go, Hanako-san is a fairly typical &quot;Goofball with a heart of gold&quot; character but the show handles him in a way that doesn&#039;t feel overly contrived which is important. Nene is pretty funny in a lot of the scenes she&#039;s in, however, it would be nice if she could break away from just a ditsy schoolgirl into a little bit more than that if possible to keep their dynamic the same. 9/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: The show is just liquid good feels. You sit down, you turn it on, and you can just shutdown and take it for what it is. It has a lightheartedness in it&#039;s early episodes that make it not a rough watch. It also has the action element so things are always being shaken up. If you want a show you can just enjoy without having to watch 20 episodes of boring first arc nonsense, this might be the show for you. 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall/Conclusion: Hanako is a show that will shake things up this season. Either it will end up being a show that lives up to the potential that it set itself up with, or it&#039;s going to crash and burn on the back half of it and fall into obscurity. I remain hopeful however, and I truly want my review to change the minds of some people who remain skeptical because of it&#039;s CRIMINAL sub 8 score on Myanimelist. 9/10<br />

    Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun created high expectations at the start of the Winter 2020 anime season, and didn&#039;t deliver. Instead what we got was a dry, formulaic show with little characterization and even less animation.<br />
<br />
To start with, the most immediately eye-catching thing about this show when scrolling through seasonals is the art style. Mayuka Itou and the rest of the staff clearly faced a decision when trying to adapt the extremely detailed source material: simplify the designs so that they&#039;re easier to animate, or stick to the level of detail of the original manga. Unfortunately, they chose the latter. While it&#039;s interesting to see a show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review333584">
        where every individual frame is so detailed it could be a desktop wallpaper, it comes at the cost of actual animation. Simply put: the characters barely move. The show is so stiff to look at that it makes me wonder why someone wouldn&#039;t just go read the manga.<br />
<br />
The problems don&#039;t end with the animation. The story is a bland Monogatari-series style haunted-school affair, although where Monogatari was creative and had interesting characters, Jibaku has none of those. Our main antagonists are causing supernatural shenanigans, but their motivations for doing so are never clearly stated. Characters are flat and impossible to imagine existing outside the world of the show. The tone of the show also fluctuates constantly; it&#039;s like the show doesn&#039;t know if it wants to be creepy, funny, or dramatic, so it tries to be all three, sometimes within a single scene. This mish-mash of emotions makes the show come off as tone-deaf. Each episode follows a very repetitive formula: Nene gets into trouble with a ghost, Hanako saves her, repeat. The only real props I can give are to the voice acting. Megumi Ogata (Shinji Ikari from Evangelion) brings her buttery voice to give a fantastic performance as Hanako.<br />
<br />
Overall, if the premise of Jibaku seems interesting, maybe read the manga. As it stands, this is an anime safe to skip.

    So where should i begin...<br />
<br />
I was really looking forward to this anime. It looked fun, and i really loved the kind of art that they showed, because it reminded me of danganronpa, an anime that i like alot.<br />
<br />
But for me, the show does not deliver a good experience. Not on the art department, i think the art is great! But with its character, humor and plot.<br />
The characters could work for me, but what makes it all fall apart is the constant &quot;Wanna be funny&quot; approch the show does. It tryies to be funny, and the humor is not thought out and very linier.<br />
<br />
Humor does not

          <span style="display: none;" id="review331903">
        have to be original to be funny, but the punchline or approch have to be very well written. This show is trying to much to make you laugh in ways that is not right.  Of course it can work for some people, i am sure you will find that this show does nothing to add a piece of it self to it`s comedy. It is very childish, so maybe i am just not it`s target audience.<br />
<br />
BUT i should also say that i do not like the kind of shows, that follow this shows formular. Its long drawn, and tryies to be mystic, and the gabs is filled with unnecessary information.<br />
<br />
So on a good day, this is a 5/10 for me

    Unfortunately, I did not like the story, as it revolves in a school, and the drawing is as bad as a colorful manga, but it is animated only and has no added sounds.<br />
In the upcoming season, I hope to improve a good drawing, because the reality of bad and bad is bad.<br />
I know that my comment will not be read by an author, producer or director. Unfortunately, this is a bad feeling. It is worse for you to do such a pathetic anime.<br />
The vixen character is pretty and she is a girl in a traditional Japanese robe.

    While I have my own mixed feelings about Hanako as a character, but I get told by friends that it&#039;ll improve over time, so I&#039;m remaining hopeful. But the rest of this show? It&#039;s really well done!<br />
<br />
With how they&#039;ve animated the manga panels, how it switches, and just the art and colours in general. It&#039;s really grand and different. Unique in it&#039;s own way. I&#039;d love more animes to get this sort of style. It&#039;s really great. But it&#039;s not just the art, it&#039;s the sound too. The op is one of the best of the season, I could listen to it for hours on

          <span style="display: none;" id="review327880">
        end. <br />
<br />
As for characters that I haven&#039;t mentioned? Nene is a treasure, she tries her best so hard, and it&#039;s really cute and funny. I hope for the best for her. I&#039;d also say any new character that pops up has an instant charm about them too, that really makes them likeable. Where they just be sweet and nice, or just over the top. It&#039;s greatly meshed together to make a fun show.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m also wondering what these other wonders will be as the anime goes on. Which&#039;ll mean I&#039;ll keep watching, and you should too! If you like mystery, and this sort of themed show. Then you&#039;ll love it! So give it a watch while it&#039;s still going! I&#039;m sure it&#039;s gonna get even better!

    The art is perfect as well as the editing. the characters are cute and the story is super enjoyable. I give it a 10 cause it&#039;s exactly what it should be and is animated way to perfectly for this not to have people who really cared about it behind it.<br />
now for the details, the story is predictable at times but that just comes with this kind of story. the art is so much on the cute side that i the characters are hard to take as dark(some character at times are supposed to) but on the other hand it stands out more and it kinda

        has the same affect in the short term.  the music is nothing special tho good. if it makes a few missteps here and there this could easily drop to a 9 but for now a 10 it is.

    **Note: This is my first review! Hopefully it will be helpful to your liking.**<br />
(I will also try to spoil as little as possible)<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the horror comedy I&#039;ve been waiting for since December of 2019. I&#039;ve had a poster of this in my room for a long while now, having 0 background info on the matter with hanako-kun&#039;s face plastered on my wall. Already 4 episodes in and I think I have an idea on how this anime will unfold(however it doesn&#039;t mean its too predictable,just have a broad idea). Now although this anime doesn&#039;t appeal to everyone, Lerche(the studio) still has done an amazing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review328100">
        job!<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
The first episode pulled me in instantly,the originality, uniqueness, and just overall re-deeming elements in the plot-line. 7 mysterious wonders of the school~. Each episode would may or may not revolve around them and be the center focus. The story flows really well, allowing watchers to take it all in and with sprinkling suspense into the fusion. The mix of dark, comedic, and cute elements in the anime just make it that much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Art:9<br />
Now the art is what really strikes me at first. The quirky yet eye-catching portrayal of hanako-kun and the surroundings. How the bright colors can go gloomy so quick depending on the mood. The art-style that depicts the tone being set so well; all make it a perfect merge. The animation of the manga panels, and the transitions is honestly so distinctive it makes you want to keep watching!<br />
<br />
Sound: 7<br />
At first the opening didn&#039;t really hit me and took me quite some time to actually enjoy it. Although, the ending was relaxing enough. The sound effects are good (especially at the creepy parts that add some mystery clouding behind it is great!!)<br />
<br />
Character: 7<br />
From Hanako kun&#039;s character, to voice actor, to his complex personality and mysterious strange background really &quot;attract&quot; you per say to him. Yashiro is also kind of clueless at times yet still adorable to just watch. Although she could use some more character depth to her and character development (which might appear in later episodes). Majority of the characters so far have a quite peculiar and interesting feature to them and I cant help but just love it.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:9<br />
<br />
I guess this would total my enjoyment to about a 9.  I hope those reading this review can watch this amazing anime itself, judge it a bit, and enjoy it in the same quality. It&#039;s such an inclusive and underrated anime, it almost needs the recognition!<br />
<br />
Overall:8<br />
<br />
Overall: I&#039;d rate this an 8. There&#039;s still room for improvement and just some slight flaws, however this anime was truly NOT a disappointment. I suggest this anime strongly for multiple reasons as read above. I hope you lovely anime watchers can enjoy it for yourself as well.<br />

    Hanako-kun is one of the shows that on the surface seems like it has no substance or actual plot. In reality, it’s got some really good writing and underneath its cutesy first few episodes, has a darker interior.<br />
<br />
Story wise, Hanako-Kun follows a young girl who struggles to make friends at school. One day she has a chance encounter with an apparition(Hanako) and forms a contract with him. The story follows their subsequent adventures to keep the school safe from rogue apparitions. The first few episodes cover a lot of fluff cases and keep a rather lighthearted tone. A little over a third of the way

        through, we get a general tone shift in which the show goes from being a mindlessly fun show, to one where there’s actually pretty big stakes involved with some unnerving scenes. It doesn’t become Evangelion, but it takes a pretty big shift nonetheless which I felt enhanced the experience and kept the story interesting.<br />
<br />
I went into this showing nothing about the manga at all. What really attracted me was the unique art style. Artistically, the show is one of the most unique anime I’ve ever seen. Lerche truly must be commended for their work with that. The few fights in the show are also extremely well done featuring a very unique animation style which I found visually pleasing. If you enjoyed the art-style of Kimetsu no yaiba, you will most likely also enjoy this one as they have very similar vibes.<br />
<br />
Hanako-Kun is one of the 4-5 really fresh shows that we got this season and easily finds itself in my top 5. I was consistently entertained throughout and constantly laughing from the well written humour and gags. It’s not a deconstruction of a genre or a masterpiece by any stretch, but it is a very very fun show and one that I found great. I highly recommend giving it a try and being patient, the first couple episodes may be slow for some people. Once it gets going, it really gets going.<br />

Hanako-Kun gets 9 fat ankles out of 10.<br />

    When you&#039;re looking through the seasonals and you see a title like Toilet-Bound Hanako Kun then you can have no expectations except it&#039;s going to be really weird and in a lot of cases, Hanako-Kun exceeds at that idea of weirdness it&#039;s title promises and a little bit more that genuinely surprised me in more ways than one. It&#039;s weird like I&#039;ve stated but it also giving you wonderful characters and genuinely striking moments that come out of nowhere and yet sticks the landing 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Toilet Bound Hanko-Kun mostly centers around Hanako-Kun, a spirit that appears in the girl&#039;s bathroom and grants people

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332928">
        wishes, Nene, a sweet, girl with daikon on her head that she calls &quot;hair&quot; with what she calls &quot;fat legs&quot; and a pretty infectious personality, in that she&#039;s very likable and Kou, a very goofy idiot that hunts spirits but ends up taking a liking to Hanako and just like Nene, is extremely likable. By the way I&#039;m writing about these characters you can already tell the main strength in this show is the characters and their interactions. They are goofy, eccentric and even at their worst, they are all extremely likable and bursting with personality. Even with the villans and one, in particular, you don&#039;t really see much of them personality-wise in the beginning but by the end, they end up being pretty likable too and end up being way harder to root for. For example, Best Boy Hyuuga is complete and total dumbass and he would be frustrating no doubt, but the actor and his whole personality just makes him come across as a dumb lovestruck puppy with the confidence and charisma of a man who doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s doing. He&#039;s fascinating and just brings the show together in a weird way. <br />
<br />
Now while the characters do play a huge role in the show&#039;s success, I do believe the aesthetic of the show is another big part of that success. It&#039;s just so unique and easy on the eyes. It reminds me of that church glass that&#039;s multi-colored but more full in overall backgrounds and designs. It also leads to some trippy visuals that I&#039;m all down for. it also adds to the character designs and they all speak so much to their personalities and it&#039;s refreshing to see that in an anime with Kritio #3224. It&#039;s just a nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
Now that we&#039;ve gotten the standout parts of the technical side of the show, there&#039;s another thing that has to come up with this show: it&#039;s lack of animation. Yes, while I did say visuals, I didn&#039;t mean the animation, which had a lack of animation or just stuff moving. There&#039;s this thing the show does constantly with certain scenes almost looking like manga pages and while that seems like a cool directorial choice, you slowly start to figure out that it&#039;s mostly used to put multiple shots into one single shot so they can use less animation and less movement. It becomes painfully obvious in certain episodes like Episode 11 where the second half is mostly the characters staying in the same room with nothing happening and then the whole thing just ends with everyone leaving. The second half has nothing and does nothing. It sucks because it&#039;s supposed to build up the finale and doesn&#039;t do that.<br />
<br />
What this lack of animation reminds me of is Food Wars, specifically the latest season. Not in terms of quality but the lack their of in movement. Both shows have multiple moments of characters not moving and even when something feels epic, it doesn&#039;t feel like it. But there is one thing that separates these two: storyboarding. With Food Wars&#039; storyboarding, it&#039;s uninspired, full of generic backgrounds basically used more of a template than actually drawing down the events that happen. Hanako-Kun gives time with its&#039; storyboarding and while the manga-like images lose it&#039;s charm as the show goes on, with the help of the great visuals and directorial work, the lack of animation isn&#039;t really an issue. It also helps that the story is interesting for the most. Yes, it is still a flaw with the show and I will count as that, but it does have some things that make it less obnoxious as a flaw.<br />
<br />
The story is, for the most part, your monster (or apparition of the week) and our motley crew of idiots helping them or making them disappear and it&#039;s pretty fun. We first get the Mokkis which are adorable and I would buy a plushie of them instantly if I could and there&#039;s one involving stairs that&#039;s probably the show&#039;s best two-parter and then there&#039;s Mitsuba, which the best episode and probably gives the best dramatic stakes to the show and I loved it. Hanko-Kun is at it&#039;s best when it&#039;s a mixture of its supernatural weirdness and genuine heartfelt character moments and when the show nails it, it hits it out of the park.<br />
<br />
In terms of negatives with the show, I would say there was wasted potential for some of the things the show does. For example, in the first episode, Nene gets turned into a small fish because of something she drank and it&#039;s revealed that she gets turned into a fish when she gets splashed by water. This comes up maybe three times within the series and the times that they do it, you could&#039;ve done it a different way and it wouldn&#039;t have mattered. Her whole fish thing ends up feeling like a waste. There are some weird pacing issues like in one episode they decide to do the first half be a monster of the week and then the next half do a bunch of character moments. While I did state that I like it when the show mixes the weird with the emotional, I don&#039;t like it when it decides to split the two off like they can&#039;t be intertwined together. Besides those, there were some jokes that didn&#039;t land and they would repeat them sometimes which was obnoxious and the show can be a little slow on the occasion, but that rarely comes up.<br />
<br />
In the end, I got what I wanted out of Toilet Bound Hanako-Kun. It&#039;s weird, got some cool visuals and left me feeling satisfied. I wouldn&#039;t call it something explosive but I did enjoy its goofiness and the way it can shift from that to having great character moments that hit hard. I would be so excited for a second season as long as they can fix some of its issues and I believe that they can. <br />
<br />
If you&#039;re looking for a show to take your eyes off the terrors of the world that has fun with a lot of goofy and supernatural elements with the possibility of making you cry, I would say give this show a shot. So instead of looking at the weird title and not expecting much, maybe see what it offers. You may not be disappointed.<br />

    Toilet-bound Hanako-kun more like Nene please stop screaming for 5 seconds-kun is another show in  &quot;apparition&quot; genre where  cast goes around solving bunch of mysteries regarding spirits, ghosts and beings of similar manner,  xxxHOlic and  Mushishi series comes to mind.  None mentioned above really did a good job in  this regard so i was hoping this show would  and at first it did look so, but after about 6 episodes entire show fell apart from me.<br />
<br />
Visually show is very pleasing. <br />
Overall design is  amazing , usually modern animes all look very slick in how they are drawn

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332375">
        which isn&#039;t bad but does get repetitive , however Toilet-bound Hanako-kun seems to have alot more cartoony feel to it, its bit hard to describe but overall ascetics have a lot more of grip. Reminded me of old Gibli movies. <br />
Secondly it felt more like animated manga rather than anime.  Each frame often was made up of several panels with noticeable  borders between them, with each  focusing on different aspects of the scene. Not only this was pretty unique it changed the viewing experience all togethe,r as now show can use said panels to focus on one sole important  aspects of the scene or present small bits of information which aren&#039;t important enough to have whole screen dedicated to them but do add depth and interest to the story.<br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t clear enough i really liked and enjoyed art style and animation of Toilet-bound Hanako-kun, so it hurts me  see story failing over wise such well done anime.<br />
<br />
What usually causes which are about apparitions is that on episode to episode basis they aren&#039;t interesting enough or have lack luster or none existent  over arcing plot and this show ticked both of  those boxes.<br />
 <br />
Show fails per episode basis because it follows same  repetitive  structure.<br />
<br />
1.There is rumor of apparition 1 <br />
2. Nene goes to Hanako to talk about it<br />
3. They go out to solve it<br />
4. At some point Nene  gets in trouble with certainty she is about to die or get harmed<br />
5. Heroic Hanako saves her very last second<br />
<br />
this structure is fine for like 3-4 episodes but not for entire season. Nene having near death experiences first few times serves good purpose. It shows what she is getting into is dangerous line of work and also paints Hanako in positive light as he saves the heroine. <br />
After first few episodes trying to convince audience that Nene is any actual danger and isn&#039;t going to be saved by Hanako like he did 6 times before well for lack of better term is poorly thought out.<br />
btw did I  say how much Nene screams? cause she  does fuck ton. Show relies on her scream to bring tention in any fight scene and also act as comedic relief  by have Nene have over the top reaction  to everyday moments.<br />
 <br />
Hanako while having potential  always felt incoherent , a scene of him fooling around is abrupted by him  suddenly getting  emotional and serious. I understand that idea is that he is actually caring person but  has light hearted persona, but it messes with entire show its hard  get invested in him or any scene he is in because it can change back and worth between 2 stays at any moment.<br />
<br />
Minamoto is largely neglected it would have been interesting if show focused more of his origins and his battle between following family traditions and finding his own way to live but all really gets is 2 episode arc with non lasting effects.<br />
<br />
apparitions were fine,they weren&#039;t shows weak park but were far from being its strong point as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
OSTs were overall good. Opening song  was a stand out for me personally, rest of songs didn&#039;t leave any lasting impression but I suspect this was more due to rest of show being emotionally hollow, there is only so much song can do then it has to accompany  a mediocre story.<br />
Overall Toilet-bound Hanako-kun is visually amazingly executed show with disappointing characters and lack luster plot.<br />
Its not show worth watching although, one could still watch it for its creative presentation.<br />
I reached episode 10 and was so indifferent towards story I didn&#039;t bother to watch last two.

    My first impression on the anime :<br />
At first, I decided to skip this anime because of the tittle &quot;Toilet&quot; but then decided to give it a try because of the good review &amp; the art style. I am glad I did not skip it. This anime not just become my most favourite anime in this season but also become one of my most favourite anime I have watched. <br />
<br />
Story<br />
Pros :<br />
Without spoiling, all I can say is that the story is based on a popular urban legend in Japan known as Hanako-san (the real Hanako-san is a girl but in this case, it&#039;s a boy). It

          <span style="display: none;" id="review330339">
        does starts off as a comedy series but as the story goes, we get hints that Hanako&#039;s past is not as simple as we thought &amp; it will get a little darker (the manga still have not reveal his past yet but there are some hints to it so we can make theories about it). Besides Hanako&#039;s past, there are other dark secret for other characters as well which I will not gonna spoil. I really like the way they make the mystery feels so thrilling that it makes me want to find out more about it.<br />
<br />
Cons :<br />
Some arcs from the manga are being cut off but of course, the anime is still very good.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
Pros :<br />
Every characters is very interesting &amp; the more they were introduced, the more you want to know about them. For now, I really love Hanako &amp; Kou because Hanako is the most mysterious one despite being cute &amp; funny &amp; Kou is just being best boy. &amp; the villian is also interesting as well.<br />
<br />
Cons :<br />
As I mention before, some arcs in the manga are being cut off so obviously some characters development &amp; understanding that might make a bigger impact on the characters&#039; development &amp; understanding are not as impactful as in the manga anymore especially in Kou&#039;s &amp; a certain mystery character (not gonna spoil who but his identity is revealed in episode 7).<br />
<br />
Art :<br />
Very unique art style. It&#039;s cute &amp; colourful but at the same time, you can feel the dark atmosphere or mystery in the art. &amp; I think it is kinda unique that they make manga panels in the anime.<br />
<br />
Music :<br />
Catchy &amp; great opening &amp; great ending song &amp; for the OST, although it is not memorable, it mix well with the atmosphere of the anime.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
All I can say is WOW. It is so good that after episode 3, I went and read the manga because I cannot wait for the anime weekly. I was not expecting to be this good. The drawing may look cute &amp; it does have comedy in it but there are dark theme is hidden in the comedy (something like Fruit Basket or Noragami but not exactly).<br />
<br />
P.S. The mystery build up is fun, great &amp; good plot twist so please make sure to BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET SPOILED before watching the anime because THIS SERIES IS BEST TO WATCH IT BLIND.

    Hanako-kun is an amazing series, and I always look forward to the next episode. I specifically would recommend the Japanese dub however, as the english dub has some poorly crow barred in &quot;jokes&quot; that seem like the writer is trying to sabotage this amazing show. <br />
<br />
<br />
The art, which is different from many anime, adds to the supernatural air of the show, making it easier to just watch and become immersed. <br />
<br />
I suggest keeping an eye open to details while watching, as there are little things in the background that, at least to me, seem like they are foreshadowing upcoming events or character relationships.

    If there&#039;s was a &quot;7 Wonders of the World&#039; that I wanted to SO desperately visit, it would be the vast world of Kamome Academy&#039;s &quot;7 Wonders&quot;, the uniqueness of every Wonder and the tales surrounding all 7 supernatural stories to be told. And one girl&#039;s persistence starts that ball rolling, to be one of the season&#039;s best shows on offer.<br />
<br />
After a series of unfortunate events, ugly Daikon-chan Nene Yashiro, is trying to be a romantic in the school, only to fail miserably each and every single time. The only hope for her is to find School Wonder No. 7, Hanako-san of the school&#039;s bathrooms,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332926">
        and to summon her (as the folklore says) so that she the &quot;genie in a bottle&quot; can grant her wishes. Problem is, Hanako-san is a BOY, and being coerced into the gossip of such folklore, as much as Nene didn&#039;t want to believe it: she&#039;s now part of Kamome Academy&#039;s supernatural world, and with her being an assistant to Hanako, the weird hijinks start to ensue, and they must uphold the balance of humans and the Apparitions.<br />
<br />
Far from a loose introductory plot into the story, the vast world of the &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; takes a lot of pride into showing which entities controls the supernatural space (called a Boundary) and maintaining a front while combatting the unknown is a task that only Hanako and Nene can do...not without an additional character: Kou Minamoto, an exorcist from a long family line of exorcists who wants to eradicate Hanako, but for reasons that Hanako&#039;s allowed to live (and became friends, the Happy 3 friends) with the bigger issue that&#039;s on the evil side with the Broadcasting Club&#039;s villainy (led by Sakura Nanamine, Natsuhiko Hyuga and Hanako&#039;s twin brother Tsukasa) with tampering the Seven Mysteries transcending stories and folklore with their own version that wreaks more havoc. And this makes the story tenfold better with exciting development that&#039;s progressively expanding.<br />
<br />
As far as characters go, the protagonists side of Nene, Hanako and Kou are eccentric in their own ways. Nene, in every hopeful situation of being a romantic, is constantly shot down by her ideal crush&#039;s remarks and lauded at having thicc legs (hence the ugly Daikon comment). Man, Nene is never given a break from heartache after heartache, and just keeps rolling that fact off the tongue. Hanako is the angel version of the Apparition, his constant joker and teasing style is something that many of us can get used to at low-key comedic moments and of course, taking care of Nene abundantly. Kou, more than the usual exorcist trope, his motto is &quot;act first, think later&quot;, and very often than not, his issue of troubles stem from his inexperience, but the effort makes it up for is staggering. Mitsuba, more than the transformation by Tsukasa to take over Wonder No. 3 in the later part of the series, was actually a very light-hearted character and one character that we can relate to, despite his questionable attitude and whatnot.<br />
<br />
On the antagonists side, Sakura Nanamine and Tsukasa, like Nene and Hanako, with the same contracts to help each other long-term that can only be best described as friends with benefits. The outlier being Natsuhiko Hyuga is more often a nuisance and useful/useless character to Sakura and Tsukasa (depending on the tasks at hand), truly the epitome of evil. The cute side of the school supernaturalism with rabbit-like Mokke really are cute though, just having them on screen is more than enough to satiate my happiness alone.<br />
<br />
The occurrence of 1-to-1 adaptations is very rare, and Lerche together with director Ando Masaomi has again done the impossible. Granted, he has done the same for last year&#039;s Kanata no Astra, and things aren&#039;t any different with Hanako-kun. The manga panels and cartoony character designs that match the manga to a T, I&#039;d have to say that it was a job of a feat that&#039;s all known too well with his experience over the years. The only problem is that with the manga&#039;s arc structure, careful consideration has to be done in adapting the arcs, and it was a fear that&#039;s still prevalent (to manga fans that are salty for cut content not shown in the anime). If there&#039;s a Season 2, I&#039;d like to see more stories as well, and if not, the manga is readily available.<br />
<br />
Sound-wise, nothing but bangers of brilliance. The OP made out of a collaboration with PENGUIN RESEARCH&#039;s Youji Ikuta, Masayoshi Ooishi and ZiNG, is an absolute banger, and Akari Kito&#039;s song repertoire with the ED has only gotten so much better, along with her VA performance for Nene Yashiro. Simply awesome.<br />
<br />
Overall, as great as the manga was, the anime adaptation did a very good job of representation. Far from reaching the pinnacle moments with the manga, I found it enjoyable, and for fans of the manga, hopefully this isn&#039;t a disappointment. YAS to the comedy being subjectively funny in good spots, and what a remedy it was. Easy recommendation.
