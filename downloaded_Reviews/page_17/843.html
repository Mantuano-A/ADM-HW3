    Video games are games that use interaction with the user interface through images produced by video devices. Video games generally provide a reward system such as a score calculated based on the level of success achieved in completing tasks in the game.<br />

The word &quot;video&quot; in &quot;video games&quot; initially refers to a raster display device. But with the use of the term &quot;video game&quot;, now the word video game can be used to refer to games on any display device. The electronic systems used to run video games are called platforms, for example personal computers and game consoles.<br />
<br />
taking the theme in the year one thousand nine

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290246">
        hundred and ninety one in that year the video game is still experiencing its popularity, a child named &quot;Haruo Yaguchi&quot; spends his days playing video games regardless of how his future destiny is as if the world is just a link between himself and video games .<br />
<br />
The manga composed by &quot;Oshikiri Rensuke&quot; has made JC Staff studios make this series as an anime series. JC Staff made this series feel good and have a big impact (to be honest this studio has adapted some good manga / light novels for example Shokugeki no Souma and of course Shakugan no Shana which was adapted by three seassons).<br />
<br />
no part of the voice is like eating without a drink, it doesn&#039;t feel complete if an anime doesn&#039;t have a supportive voice. For this series of voice actors, &quot;Suzushiro Sayumi&quot; acts as Oono Akira (although Oono&#039;s character rarely speaks) &quot;Hirose Yuuki&quot; acts as Hidaka Koharu and &quot;Amasaki Kouhei&quot; act as Haruo Yaguchi.<br />
<br />
from the song theme section, it might be quite fitting and well, the opening song &quot;New stranger&quot; which was sung by Sora Tob Sakana was so good even though I don&#039;t know who he was, but what made me like the series this time for the closing theme song could be a favorite &quot; Houkago die strauction &quot;which was sung by Etsuko Yakushimaru.<br />
<br />
in this series maybe at the beginning of the episode Haruo Yaguchi was an academic fool and only liked video games after the meeting with Oono Akira Yaguchi began to regard him as a rival but after a while Oono left Japan for a reason. When Oono left we got or the appearance of playing the third character, Hidaka Koharu, acts as an encouragement even though she also has feelings with Yaguchi.<br />
<br />
The series adapted by JC Staff this time is more prominent on the impression of romance and honesty, I as an audience are very enthusiastic about this series and can&#039;t wait for the story to continue where a child who often goes to the place of video games begins to have feelings for his rival and his meeting with Oono Akira grow the seeds of love are very good to watch for teenagers and adults.<br />
<br />
in the end we as humans also have a sense where we want to relieve stress from our daily busyness with the existence of video game games which are now very sophisticated and this series reminds us that we do not fall into a world that is only temporary.<br />
<br />
if you expect a happy life forever then fight from now on because of the future what we do today.

    I have been reading other opinions and positive praise around High Score Girl, but I still don&#039;t get why this is supposed to be so good and the savior of summer 2018 anime.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a generic love story where the main dude is an over exaggerated character whose behavior is the outcome of &quot;anime&quot; and not any personality traits. The main female is perfect gamer and student, beautiful and ideal girl with tragic past story AKA a textbook example of a Mary Sue. There is also another girl in the series who creates the fallacy of harem, but she only appears in few episodes and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290771">
        her entire purpose in the series is to have silent monologue inside her head where she praises the main dude for being so amazing and kind and perfect, and cucks herself for the &quot;canon pairing&quot;. <br />
<br />
The romance is build around retro gaming and that arguably offers some nostalgia and the only content that is really worth of anything in the series. The romance writing itself almost entirely relies on the Mary Sue traits of the female lead where we get cliches that commonly occur in shoujo romances, and the main dude acting like prince charming whose life resolves around the Mary Sue chick. Of course, the anime is just a fraction of the story and almost nothing outside sol happens in the romance, mainly because the girl is awkward and weird and the dude is dense above all else. In fact, at this point it&#039;s safe to say that the whole thing exists just to advertise the manga which is an obligatory read unless S02 gets confirmed. <br />
<br />
The comedy is almost never funny. In the first half of the series, it relies on goofy animation tricks and similar over exaggerated situations as the main dude&#039;s behavior. This is best seen in scenes where the mc gets hit by a car and spin in the air for something like 20 times or gets kicked in the nuts by other characters. The 2nd half didn&#039;t even attempt to do any comedy anymore outside mc&#039;s mom and few reliefs.<br />
<br />
The art is real nice and the retro gaming side of the story is entertaining to watch, but the romance writing is closer to pathetic than anything else and our characters are mediocre, average at best. <br />
<br />
I already wrote a longer review earlier but it was buried under the praise so I will leave this as a short explanation on why I don&#039;t personally find this series to be amazing at all. Sure it was okay to watch, but I wouldn&#039;t personally go praising story or characters of this sort.

    High Score Girl is one of the theses seasonal shows that quietly snuck up on me at the of the Summer 18 season. It was a manga series done by Oshikiri, Rensuke and until mid August where it Netflix announced they will be streaming the series in December 2018 the show least for a short while was hanging around in obscure vile and even after that Netflix announced the series is still pretty obscure compared to almost every other anime from this summer season.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to late September where I was done watching throwaway seasonal anime from this season like Angel Of Death, How to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290287">
        Not Summon a Demon Lord and Happy Sugar Life I decided to check out High Score Girl after leaving the show in my plan to watch list for so long. Then I watched it and after watching all 12 episodes of this I can defiantly say this. High Score Girl is not only the best anime from this season but it&#039;s also one of the best modern anime romcom to ever come period. I completely underestimated this show because at first, I thought this would be another forgetful romcom anime but this series completely blew me away in terms of writing, characters, music, romance and plot to a point where the series became a masterpiece<br />
The story follows Haruo Yaguchi who is a gamer who spends he&#039;s all free time at the arcades playing various retro games such as Street Fighter II than take his daily life seriously, earning him the title Beastly Fingers Haruo. However, things would take a turn one day when he encounters honour student and rich girl Akira Oono dominating everyone else at his favourite game with Zangief. Having lost to her 7 times in a row and eager to break her 29-win streak, he resorts to underhanded tactics with his own favourite character Guile, an act which earns him a solid right hook from the otherwise quiet and aloof girl—and ultimately sparks their rocky relationship as she brazenly follows him from arcade to arcade after school.<br />
<br />
The story of High Score Girl is brilliant and sweet.<br />
Right from the gate, the show makes a great first impression where the show fantastically shows us the setting of the series with its early 90s gaming atmosphere where there are people standing up watching the players playing various arcade games. Not only that but it greatly introduces it&#039;s main two chararters in a form of a Street Fighter match where up to that point they have never interacted with each other.<br />
It is series is effectively a coming of age tale of two people who meet up thanks to the hobby of gaming as well them understanding how the world really works outside of gaming. <br />
At first this show may appear as your typical happy romcom anime however as the series progresses the show becomes more than just your typical romcom anime where the anime slowly dives into serious and relatable themes such as lack of free will, child abuse, letting go of your hobbies in favour of improving your studies and helping people get into the medium that you love and am glad that the show was able to handles theses theme with respect. <br />
The romance in this show is very well handled. At first, Haruo and Oona don&#039;t have much chararter chemistry with each other but at the series progresses these two started to understand each other thank to video games to a point by the end of the series you feel like they are made for each other.<br />
Even though this show a rom-com at heart it was still a great detail that adds more life to this show world.<br />
The one thing that I loved about High Score Girl is how the show perfectly presents gaming in the 90s era. Before the days of Fortnite, Call Of Duty and League of Legends where people play these games online people would go to the arcades to play various games such as Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge etc. Not only that but compared to modern gamers today where they mostly spend the time talking to people online thanks to the power of the internet people around that time would ask face to face if they co-op/versus match with them.<br />
Another thing that I liked about High Score Girl that was that the gaming industry develops alongside the characters for example in episode 1 people are playing the arcades as well SNES/Genesis however after episode 8 onwards people in the show started to talk about Virtual Boy, Sega Saturn and PlayStation 1 showing us how much the technology has evolved since episode 1. You would think that the attention of detail would be pointless in the overall narrative but it isn&#039;t as it perfectly tackles the themes of catching up, pride and getting left behind. In episode 10 when Harou lost to Koharu in both Street Fighter and Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge he didn&#039;t simply lose the fight but he&#039;s slowly losing his gaming pride as while all the new games and consoles were coming out Haruo was studying hard to get the high school that Oono is in and because of all that hard work Haruo literally started to struggle to play games for a while. This doesn&#039;t end there the social commentary in High Score Girl is extremely well handled. Throughout the show, characters would often commentate on a certain games/consoles as well as nongamers giving they views on the game industry. For example Haruo mother despite her being clueless about video games she doesn&#039;t mind Haruo playing video game even if his grades are at rock bottom. On the other side, we have Oono&#039;s private tutor who thinks that video games are a big waste of time and she doesn&#039;t’ want her to be part of the gaming crowd<br />
Overall the story in High Score Girl was amazing as it’s not only a great throwback to 90s gaming but it’s the best modern love story I have ever seen.<br />
10/10<br />
<br />
Characters.<br />
Now we have the charters and to be frankly honestly the characters are all awesome and enjoyable in they own ways.<br />
First up have our main protagonist Haruo who is an anti-social boy who has a passion for video games. Haruo may start off as a generic romcom geek protagonist he quickly became one of the most relatable character I have ever seen in a long while.<br />
The way that he develops over the course of this series was as he went from being an anti-social kid who just sat down playing video games to a sociable person who starts caring more about the world as well Onna by trying his best to reduce his gaming addiction just so he can better person. It doesn&#039;t stop there the way he behaves and acts towards people was a nice portrayal of gamers from the 90s as whole were they so passionate toward video games that they either stay in the arcades playing games until closing time or pretending to be ill so they can play more games missing school in the progress. Overall brilliant chararter and he&#039;s by far my favourite chararter in the series. <br />
Next, we have Akira Oona who is the silent rich daughter of the Onno family who sneaks away every so often to the gaming arcades to escape the harsh environment at home. Despite her being mostly silent in the anime I really enjoyed Oona. Instead of being another typical loud tsundere type she uses facial expressions that what she likes and what she hates. This alone makes Oono a complex chararter because the only way we relate communicate with Oono is by facial expressions. Unlike Haruo where he a great gaming life Oono gaming life is pretty sad as she has a strict private tutor that prevents her from going the hobbies that she enjoys doing like playing Video Games and while all that drama is going on she doesn&#039;t say a word as she show us her facial expression of what she&#039;s feeling. Overall great character.<br />
Finally, we have Hidaka a girl who has no real hobbies. I really like her. At first, I thought she would just love triangle bait for the main two however as the series progresses she beings her own character where instead of interfering with the potential couple she actually supports Haruo by helping him get closer to Oono. Her character doesn&#039;t end there she actually starts getting interesting playing video games and by the 10th episode, she becomes a competent gamer for fighting games.<br />
The rest of the characters were great for what they were as they are all fun and entertaining to watch especially Haruo&#039;s mom.<br />
Overall the characters High Score Girl were amazing and it&#039;s easily the series biggest strength<br />
<br />
10/10<br />
Visuals.<br />
While the story and chararters were amazing I sadly cannot say the same thing the visuals because this is easily the weakest part of High Score Girl. Okay the visuals aren&#039;t necessarily bad in fact I don&#039;t mind if a show goes for a different visual style but the problem with High Score Girl is how the show uses it&#039;s CGI. When the show it&#039;s at best visually the anime can look pretty good however a lot of the show can look rough especially the first half where the CGI was at it&#039;s worst. It eventually did get better in the second half as the show more constraint with its CGI but I honestly wish the show could have handled the CGI a bit better where it can attract the mainstream audience of anime fans. It&#039;s such a shame really because the show is outside its use of CGI is very good especially when the show uses actual footage of video games that are been played by real skilled people. <br />
7/10<br />
<br />
Sound.<br />
The soundtrack in High Score Girl is an amazing throwback piece towards the 90s gaming as many of the tracks in the anime have that nice retro 16-bit mix to it along with a couple of modern tracks. <br />
The opening theme New Stranger by sora tob sakana is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures the show tone and setting of the series with a nice blend of modern and 16-bit style. Not to mention it&#039;s very catchy. <br />
The ending theme &quot;Houkago Diestrauction by Etsuko Yakushimaru is a clam and relaxing theme that perfectly closes each episode of High Score Girl. While it&#039;s not as great as the opening theme it&#039;s still a good song that is memorable on its own right. <br />
The voice acting in High Score Girl is incredible. The Seyiuss all did a fantastic job on the roles that they were given. Not only was the voice acting well acted but the characters react to the games based on voice acting alone was great as they all sound like actual gamers that either won or lose a game. <br />
At this time of the review, High Score Girl hasn&#039;t got an English Dub, however, like with Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan the show will be dubbed sometime in the future by Netflix.<br />
9/10<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts.<br />
High Score Girl is another modern anime masterpiece.<br />
Sure the CGI in the show wasn&#039;t that great however the writing, romance, music, characters, and the great use of gaming references completely make up to a point where we can ignore the shows meh use of CGI. The show was truly a wonderful experience I will never forget and because of that, I thank the people who make High Score Girl for making this wonderful anime that perfectly shows that the story and characters come first before the production values.<br />
<br />
Final Score 9.5/10

    There’s often times when I feel a bit of nostalgia in life. Who doesn’t really? The 1990s may not be technological advanced compared to our current modern times but it had great music, a more relaxing atmosphere, and moments that we’ll never forget. I remember the days when people actually went to places like Blockbuster to rent home videos rather than binge watching Netflix. People weren&#039;t on their phones half the day. Nowadays, everything is just too convenient and people operate at their homes through the digital web. Why do I mention this?<br />
<br />
It’s because High Score Girl made me feel a bit of that nostalgia.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290247">
        <br />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong though. I love the convenience of our current times and everything being so simple. However, watching High Score Girl gave me the impression of old school video gaming nostalgia. I was never too big about retro games or playing at the arcades. However, the contemporary times of this show made it feel like it’s both realistic and inspiring. As a series about video games, it takes an approach at decorating its story with a 1990s sensation.<br />
<br />
We meet 6th grader Haruo Yaguchi from the start and he is not exactly someone I’d describe as popular at school. He’s a video game addict who spends his time playing games than studying or doing anything else. In many ways, Haruo doesn’t really have a goal in life other than to be the best gamer. His favorite genre seems to be fighting games such as Street Fighter II. He even earned a self-proclaimed title by calling himself “Beastly Fingers Haruo”. His life seems to be unchanging until meeting a rich girl named Akira Oono. After getting curb stomped by her at video gaming, it became obvious that he is no longer the best. This sets the main story as we see the relationship between the two and how they develop.<br />
<br />
Jumping into this series felt unusual at first. It felt like a coming of age story that mixes in drama, comedy, and even some romance. The last part isn’t noticeable at first so I’ll get to it later. Rather, the story chronicles about how Haruo’s character changes throughout the series. In the beginning, he is more of a brat who tends to get angry when things don’t go his way. You ever seen a kid rage at video games because he lost like a sore loser? That’s the sort of imagery you can imagine coming from Haruo. However, meeting Oono changes his character as he matures and becomes a more tolerable person. I think it’s rather ironic that he offers to be friends with Oono as the two are more like rivals in the beginning. However, the show makes it clear that there’s a skill difference between the two though so perhaps it isn’t really a close rivalry. I think it’s important to address the friendship between Haruo and Oono as it develops into perhaps something more than just a bond. In later episodes, Oono seems to show feelings towards Haruo while the boy remains oblivious. It’s more of an innocent affection than anything else since the series doesn’t truly commit to romance. Despite this, I think it goes to show how far these two bonded together. Because let’s face it, Oono is a character with a quiet nature. No one besides Haruo seems to be able to get close to her. Even with her popularity, she is shy and throughout the show, we never once hear her speak directly to a character. She is able to open herself more thanks to Haruo’s influence and we see her show more emotions rather than being aloof all the time. There seems to be even feelings of jealousy coming from the girl in later episodes.<br />
<br />
We eventually meet a girl named Koharu Hidata. Unlike Oono, she is more outspoken and easily fits with the crowd. Despite not being a child prodigy, Hidata is a much more sociable person as she is able to converse with anyone. Hidata’s relationship with Haruo in the show is pretty typical that transforms from being normal friends to her developing a crush towards him. In terms of technical skills, she isn’t as talented as Haruo or Oono when it comes to video games. However, the creators establishes her as a determined girl who wants to prove herself, and most importantly to Haruo. I’d say that she is more of a tsundere after observing her behavior. You be the judge but Hidata does add a different side of the series. She fills the role of being a character that Haruo doesn’t feel inferior to and can get along normally. Still, the series doesn’t do a well job at building their relationship because as usual, Haruo is oblivious to romance like a stone cold rock. <br />
<br />
There’s a lot of emphasis on these three characters so you’re probably asking yourself if there are any others to worth mention. Unfortunately, most of the side characters in the series can be easily forgettable. Characters like Miyao (the chick magnet) hardly influences the story. The adult characters also makes little impact such as Oono’s butler or Haruo’s parents. It feels like these characters are just there and nothing more. Nonetheless, this really shouldn’t sway your attention as the heart of the show is about how characters changes through common interests and how they understand each other. There’s a good amount of heartwarming moments and clever comedy if you&#039;re into that too.<br />
<br />
It’s almost impossible to not talk about the art style of this series. When it comes down to it, the show feels like a mixture of old school aesthetic blending with video game graphics. Even the theme songs is crafted with its peculiar video game style. Thankfully, it’s very faithful to the manga especially in terms of character design. And on most parts, I think they did a phenomenal job at portraying Oono. Despite not speaking at all in the show, she is able to express herself with body language and facial expressions. It’s important to also realize Oono’s change in those expressions that represent her development. Meanwhile, I’m also grateful for the realistic 1990s setting the series takes place in with the arcade games. Retro games like Street Fighter is shown with clever creativity while the graphic style represents the old school ways of playing. However, I wish the series presented more variety. Besides Street Fighter, there’s hardly any other games that are worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
The 1990s really was a time that I missed. Everything just felt so simple and while I’m not as dedicated to retro games as the characters in this show, it still made me want to play them. That is to say, they still exist in our modern times but playing them now just feels different. Nonetheless, this series isn’t just about gaming but also how characters change. The creators really wanted us to get attached to the main characters and it worked. High Score Girl is a show that I recommend to anyone even if you’re not a video game fanatic. It has enough of a story with themes and main characters that will get your attention.

    Summer 2018 will pass as one of the most mediocre seasons for me, but it was saved by High Score Girl.<br />
<br />
The video game story concept is one of the most popular but also one of the most difficult to create. It requires an unusual plot to satisfy a difficult and demanding audience. Gladly, High Score Girl does a marvelous job and delivers one of the most amusement stories in this field. The series mixes the historical video game developing (the 90s) with an amazing plot where the memories of any gamer will have some empathy. In this world, we are all experts but also we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290737">
        are ignorant, and sooner or later our talents will meet challengers as happens in this fascinating story. But what can I tell you about the 90s? This decade is one of the most important technologically speaking. The internet was born on 1990, the CPU (first Pentium) and GPU (shading and rendering) appeared as we know them today. The video games transcended thanks to those hardware advances, Google appeared in 1995 and many other tech stuff that we use day after day saw the light in the 90s. We need to thank the 90s for our actual technology, and this anime is a tribute to all those developers that shaped our world. High Score Girl is one of the best gaming anime representations that follow a real historical timeline.<br />
<br />
The story is straightforward and very easy to follow. It creates relationships from usual clichés such as video game challenges. The plot occurs in a casual world filled with arcade machines and game centers; it creates a magnificent 90s ambiance where the main characters converge and interact refreshingly without the need of the average slice of life comedy story. The plot is hilarious, dramatical and romantic. However, the most amazing part is the characters&#039; synergy with a well-elaborated plot. We have three main characters, the typical gaming freak, the challenger that never speaks but she is very expressive reminding me of the phrase “action speaks louder than words” and the converted. All the three characters in some way are rivals with certain personal interests but also friends. I like that idea of rivalry; it is not the typical garbage where the rival is awful, boring and pedantic. It is a rivalry where the main characters want to be noticed between them as rivals, friends and more.<br />
<br />
Another great factor, the gaming references. The plot utilizes some games to boost the narrative. Perhaps the biggest reference is with the Street Fighter franchise. The series uses characters such as Guile to propel the narrative, and they do it very well. We can say this game character is an active part of the story. Additionally, all the arcade and classic game references are just amazing. I almost lost my breath after watching Bomberman and Elevator Action, and I am not that old. Furthermore, I am surprised that several companies agreed to allow the anime to use a massive group of references. It is not normal because the rights and licenses are a pain or ask the author because the manga was in a hiatus for a dispute with SNK.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the characters. In one word synergy. Perhaps the chemistry between the characters is the most important when you design a group of characters. As one of my old animation co-workers said: “First create a background, then figure the synergy between the characters, and if you can&#039;t do it, the story will be a fiasco.”  We have three main characters, the freak, the challenger and the converted as I said before. <br />
<br />
The freak is Harou Yaguchi. The typical gaming lover. He likes the challenges and wants to be the best. Also, he has a charming side, and he cares of his friends. <br />
<br />
The challenger, Oono Akira. For me, she is the most amazing character because never talks, but the actions and expressions help us to understand how she is feeling. She is Harou’s main rival, very lonely and I think she suffers a lot.  I want to add a parenthesis here; it is unrespectful mocking the seiyuu because she never talks. If you pay attention, she needs to recreate some particular sounds or minimal sound ambiance to add emotion and action to the scene, if you think that it is easy you do not value all the work of a voice actor. <br />
<br />
The converted, Hidaka Koharu. I am not going to spoil about her. I consider her as the story breaking point. <br />
<br />
About the art, it is good. The use of CGI is smooth. They combined some 3D and Live2D techniques creating a very appealing series that has a nice palette color, good lighting model and a very reasonable camera angle use. Furthermore, they add old video games references that improve the story flow and adds nostalgic feeling. The art, in general, is amazing, and I liked and enjoyed it   <br />
<br />
The sound and music are great. The ED for me is the best; I love those lyrics, no idea why :3. The VO is good, and the score and games sound is perfect. In general, the sound timing is good and does help the plot outcome and the main events. <br />
<br />
As a negative aspect, we have the overuse of the CGI. The transition between CGI and 2DLive could be rough, but it is one of the small limitations between the techniques. I understand some spectators try to avoid the CGI shows. However, High Score Girl deserves a try no matter if you love video games or casual comedies.<br />

    Many times throughout my short existence, I truly believed that I grasped everything that there has been to see, that life could not throw anything at me that would faze me, surprise me, or make me lose the already very little faith I have in humanity, this anime managed to do that. I am absolutely shocked, dumbfounded, I cannot possibly begin to comprehend how this show has been not only given decent ratings, but excellent ratings, how anyone could possible like this show is beyond my level of comprehension and ability to empathize with other individuals. Hi-Score Girl should be shamed, a show that should

          <span style="display: none;" id="review301550">
        be highlighted as to why the industry has been going down the toilet ever since the early 2000&#039;s, This piece of &quot;entertainment&quot; is nothing more than a superficial merit-less piece of media that has managed to pull on people&#039;s nostalgia cords in order to pretend that it is something more than it is. <br />
<br />
The entire premise is based around these middle schoolers playing video games back in the early 1990&#039;s, many avid video game fans will feel right at home with the numerous references to gaming culture. Hi-Score Girl entirely relies on nostalgia, as otherwise the show has absolutely no merit on its own, basically waving all these references to the viewer&#039;s face in order to distract them from the sheer incompetence and the utter lack of any talent that went into the production. <br />
<br />
The two main characters are not even characters, they are totally devoid of any reasonable human behavior and characteristics, the way they interact with one another is simply unhuman, the script suffers as a result with Hi-Score Girl just expecting the viewer to overlook nonsensical conversations between characters. Did I say conversations?, actually it&#039;s more like one-sided conversations, since the main female lead just refuses to speak, all she manages to do is to have a resting derp face, or to make a series of clueless experssions that she somehow expects everyone to grasp instantaneously. She is a horrid person, she hits and essentially abuses the male main lead due to the fact that she essentially expects him to mind read her in order to get along, if he doesn&#039;t immediately know what she wants, she retaliates in a physical manner, which of course is so incredibly romantic, considering somehow even with this obviously abusive/mentally-challenged behavior the male main lead starts to like the non-talking, physical abusive, derp looking girl. As for the main male lead, well he is not all that likable either, he is an overly hyper and irresponsible brat, his over dramatic reactions to every single event is beyond annoying and tedious. I could write an entire essay on how poorly written these two characters are, but I will save you the suffering from that, clearly whoever wrote these two characters has no understanding of how human conversations work or how humans behave in general. This has been a common theme the past few years in anime with human characters that don&#039;t behave/act even remotely human, Hi-Score Girl is one of the worst in recent memory in this regard, and should be taken notice as a study guide on how not to portray human characters in a relatively grounded setting.<br />
<br />
The animation is downright pathetic and ugly, the main girl who is suppose to be attractive in this universe supposedly, looks nothing more than a derp. The background are abysmal, lack detail and any sense of effort. Music is just awful, the opening theme is typical modern non-sense that doesn&#039;t even fit the horrendous opening animation. I had enough, just writing this review has given me a brain aneurysm, in short Hi-Score Girl is an abomination, devoid of any merit, meaning or skill, the fact that this is highly rated on this site has me worried for the future of this industry.

    It&#039;s rare to see series like this that is very niche: Covering nostalgia in the form of retro arcade games, to their home conversions and the like. However, this is certainly not an anime for everyone, and solely caters to the gaming audience of old times lore, whom for all intensive purposes, will love this overlooked anime.<br />
<br />
The story goes of the early gaming scenes in the early 90s (specifically 1991 and beyond), where Japanese retro arcades (at that time) had a massive following due to the big wave of top-tier games, and that accelerated with the release of Street Fighter II, that single-handedly revived one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290249">
        of the best gaming periods ever in the history of gaming. So naturally, casual gamers flocked into the arcades to try out the hit sensational game, and that is no difference to 6th grader Yaguchi Haruo, who has been living his life off games. Unlike typical school children, he is neither every good thing nor entertaining at the greatest degree, his passion is just to be a crazy gaming fanboy cashing in on the video game craze. So one day, while tormenting rookies at Street Fighter II, he comes across an mysterious sight of fellow classmate Oono Akira, whom so happens to also play the game, and sadly got rekted embarrassingly badly by her. Determined by his flare to never concede defeat, amidst her quietness and shyness of following Haruo around to play arcade games, and finding himself conceivably getting &quot;cucked&quot; by Oono in EVERY game played, only once did he win over her with the reward being a punch in the face (ouch, Haruo). From there, the weirdness of both Oono and Haruo&#039;s love-comedic relationship ensues out of ridicule and resolution (for Haruo to defeat Oono, even once would be great to sing praises over himself).<br />
<br />
The anime adaptation of the manga is perfectly synchronized and doesn&#039;t cut corners, explaining to us of the gaming backgrounds that perfectly set the charts of events that our male MC went through. Overtime, the gamer scenes backspaced into the core understanding of the characters, most notably, the struggles of Haruo with not wanting to let go of the gaming craze that set his heart ablaze, to Oono and rival Koharu Hidaka fighting for Haruo&#039;s love affection (which we all know he doesn&#039;t care, not even the slightest). From there the dignifying love rom-com aspect takes Numero Uno, first place to uncover what makes the characters tick their bones and define what they truly do.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the characters, I&#039;m sad that the one-dimensional aspect of the characters played a big part here (which can be boring), but what I&#039;m assured about is the same aspect that would help define the characters here and play a massive part of their exposition:<br />
<br />
Yaguchi Haruo, typical gamer, has nothing worthy of his self-worth to add into his name, but his love for retro games serve as the main catalyst of his life as a growing gamer, basically nothing stands in his way of the love of games, and will not hesitate to trample on anyone to reach his desires.<br />
Oono Akira, the well-rounded character who is forced to be everything society demands of her: coming from a &quot;big house&quot; name and following in her parents&#039; footsteps, she yearns for the outside life, and Haruo plays a major significance in her life, serving as her means of escape of everything that demands her attention and recognition.<br />
Kohaku Hidaka, the 3rd wheel in the relationship between Haruo and Oono, she seems like the atypical crush-after-boy figure, chasing after our male MC in the world of gaming (which at first isn&#039;t very accustomed to), eventually learning his traits and catching up to him in order for Haruo to notice her (see the similarity of love rom-com)?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s impressive that this series manages to compartmentalize the characters and their growth, which in turn sets the overall pacing which is great and doesn&#039;t feel like an incomplete set of events that just so happened to trail past us by.<br />
<br />
The art and animation is one I&#039;m actually caught by full surprise. Knowing how the manga actually try to incorporate the exact forms of the various amount of game aesthetics, the anime adaptation has to fulfill that core information, and it&#039;s very subjective. Having veterans J.C.Staff to do this adaptation is rest assured by all means (mostly for 2D background art), but that CGI animation, oh hell does it deliver despite its wonkiness and uncertainty that at anytime the production means will falter. The last time this actually happened is Fall 2017&#039;s Houseki no Kuni (which was a CGI masterpiece), and with High Score Girl, to be able to input this much effort with the perfect replication of retro games, it is something that you have to get used to it, with the overall quality up to your varying tastes for good CGI animation quality.<br />
<br />
The music is one hardcore reference to the retro game vibes of the 90s. Both the OP and ED forebodes the 8-bit musical style that will be noticeable and reminiscent to old retro gamers, along with the lyrics (if you have time to analyze them), and is a perfect fit for the entire show itself. Personally I had fun listening to the OST, never skipped them, which was a blessing indeed.<br />
<br />
Overall, why does the Summer 2018 season have so many noticeable-and-mediocre and underrated-and-overlooked shows, we will certainly not know. What I do know is that this anime falls into the &quot;underrated-and-overlooked&quot; category, and is certainly another sleeper hit. I would only recommend this show to avid retro and casual gamers if you want to know how is it like for another medium to condense the entire retro gaming structure. Besides, what&#039;s not to have fun when games are at the central of it all?

    (WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL MINOR SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
In an anime that takes place in the retro 1900&#039;s where arcade video games and early generation consoles were most commonly played and at large, everyone&#039;s on their feet and anxiously waiting for the new Street Fighter games. Who knew that two talented aspiring young players met in the same arcade and began to gradually fall for each other as the anime progresses, all of which contains many references to classic arcade games that will truly bring you fond memories of the golden age of video games.<br />
<br />
One of the most unique aspects about Hi Score Girl that I find

          <span style="display: none;" id="review352710">
        to be noticeably unique is the music or overall sound, the soundtracks are beautiful and rich in emotions that it will tug at your heat strings. You generally won&#039;t find a lot of animes that give out references to classic arcade video games or genuinely the 1900&#039;s, which adds to the fact that this anime is special in it&#039;s own way, all the more to watch it.<br />
<br />
Story (8): Hi Score Girl takes a similar approach to the classic romantic relationships you would find in animes these days, consisting of a tsundere girl falling in love with the average male protagonist whom is a video game attic.<br />
<br />
Art (8): The art in the anime isn&#039;t anything really special but it is still visually appealing and very good, it&#039;s sort of nostalgic and fits in with the 1900&#039;s feel.<br />
<br />
Sound (10): The most memorable parts about the anime was it&#039;s soundtracks as I said before, it had the ability to display so much emotions into it that it made me cry multiple times throughout the anime.<br />
<br />
Character (8): The main characters in the anime I found to be very cute considering that it was a video game romantic anime. Going on wild adventures while enjoying life as kids, it also had a great support cast as well. In multiple scenes you could see the two main male and female characters expressing their love for each other, although it wasn&#039;t clearly visible, it was very adorable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (10): I enjoyed every episode of Hi Score Girl, binge-watching every episode but unfortunately was sad for it to end, desperately waiting for season three of the anime.<br />

Overall (9): Of course this anime isn&#039;t for everyone but for those who was born in the mid to late 1900&#039;s and have played arcade and also early generation consoles games all their lives, then this is for you!

    In life there are things people randomly hate. For instance, stuff like &quot;minecraft youtubers&quot; and competitive eaters. There are things we randomly hate with a passion even when it doesn&#039;t harm anyone or anything in anyway shape or form.<br />
<br />
However, after watching this anime the opposite may be true as well. <br />
<br />
I remember the first time I set sight on this anime while browsing through Netflix. It seemed out of place, a childish cartoon shape figure set between the beautifully drawn art of Violet Evergarden and critically esteemed Kimiuso. <br />
<br />
I disregarded it, I never was a gamer or into arcade life so why would I be

          <span style="display: none;" id="review355299">
        into a poorly drawn &quot;Gamers&quot;?<br />
<br />
Then came a day when I, still using my friends Netflix, got bored of the 15 anime Netflix had and decided to give High Score Girl a go. I was taken away.<br />
<br />
The story falls in line with most anime cliches: useless guy &quot;falls in love&quot; with rich shelter girl, but twisted it elegantly. Set in the 90&#039;s during the arcade boom, the anime follows the 6th grader Haruo journey to become the greatest street fight gamer in the world. However, along the way he meets an unlikely acquaintance: Akira Oono. The direction and goal of Haruo changed.<br />
Slowly, Oono drifted into Haruo&#039;s life. A bond is quickly formed and slowly it seems that the characters were made for each other.<br />
I give this story 9/10: Though slow the story is nothing short of extraordinary.<br />
<br />
This only thing that&#039;s particularly under-average for this anime is its art; there is a hell ton of CGI used poorly in the beginning few episodes. However, it was soon fixed. The art may be childish and seem like a cartoon but you&#039;ll grow into it as the show progresses.<br />
Art: 7.5/10 rounded to 8<br />
<br />
The sound is done cleanly. There&#039;s nothing exceptional about it but there&#039;s nothing bad about it. This is one of the rare shows where I actually liked the ending more than the opening.<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t even know how to describe the characters. Summed up in one word I would have to say: phenomenal. Our MC does all of the talking, much like any middle-highschooler of today. However, unrealistically the MC can read emotions. The Main Heroine, Oono, is a women of few words. In fact I firmly believe she didn&#039;t say a single word throughout both seasons. However, with her melodramatically facial expressions we get the jist of what she&#039;s saying. At the same thing we also got our competitor heroine Hidaka who is just too nice of a character. Other than that the side-characters play minor support roles but still fit into the story nicely.<br />
Characters: 9/10<br />
<br />
Overall I believe both seasons of HSG are gems. They&#039;re cleanly polished and some of J.C Staff&#039;s best work. For such a minimalist show it sure struck a chord in my heart.<br />
Final rating: 9/10 <br />
<br />
<br />

    I&#039;ve been a fan of High Score Girl since the manga and I think the anime is a pretty good adaption of it overall. The score it currently has really doesn&#039;t suit it but it might be because it&#039;s not for everyone I personally think it&#039;s great due to the atmosphere, story, comedy and of course the retro video games.<br />
<br />
The story takes place in 1991 when the main character, Haruo finds the rich quiet girl Ono, playing a game of Street Fighter 2 at an arcade and defeating everybody who challenges her, even our guy Haruo. Eventually through blood, sweat and cheap tactics Haruo steals

          <span style="display: none;" id="review285508">
        a win off her and in retaliation she punches him right in the face, and that&#039;s how this love story start.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t let the CGI fool you, this isn&#039;t just some cheap anime that&#039;s trying to rope you in because it has retro video games (although, that is why I was roped in, and they&#039;re great). The anime itself has great comedic moments, heartfelt moments and even some dramatic and shocking moments. The anime can have you gawking at the accurate retro games to laughing your arse off to Ono punching Haruo whenever he gives a cheeky remark to worrying over whether or not Ono and Haruo will play another game at the arcade again! There can be cute moments from Ono being scared of spooky games and there can be uncute moments such as a guy asking to see the bone in Haruo&#039;s penis, but that&#039;s a story for another time.<br />
<br />
The main aspect of the anime is obviously the retro video games, but as time goes on they take a backseat I&#039;d say. You really get to love the characters and the games just become set pieces, but fun set pieces because you can feel the joy of seeing them just like the main characters. If you&#039;re a fan of cute romance stories, comedy and retro games then definitely give this one a try, I&#039;d say it&#039;s AOTS just from the first four episodes., there really is nothing like it as well it&#039;s such a unique and interesting anime that even if you&#039;re not a huge fan of retro games you should give it a watch just for the environment it is set in.<br />
<br />
The only negatives I can really give this show is that, the first episode can be quite slow due to setting things up and being a collection of stories but the later episodes don&#039;t have this, and another negative could be the CGI although you hardly notice it as you watch it. <br />
<br />
Overall, I find High Score Girl to be a unique and interesting anime just because of it&#039;s setting being untapped in anime, but it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a story trying to sell itself with retro video games. It&#039;s a cute love story and I think that the games help give it a unique story and plot device to bundle it all up in.<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
-Retro games galore from the gameplay to the sound effects<br />
-Cute Romance Story<br />
-Has a lot of funny moments<br />
-Cute heartfelt moments as well, has a few tearjerkers as well<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
-Episodes can be slow, the first one especially<br />
-CGI can be an eyesore depending on who you ask<br />
<br />
As of now, there are no subs from official groups, but there are some fansubs out there to find, so keep an eye out. I&#039;d give it a 8/10 just because it&#039;s really what you can expect from the manga and more. I&#039;m also happy that the score has gone up from a 6.7 to a 7.1, I hope this can at least break a 7.5.<br />
<br />
Also please excuse how awful this review is, I just noticed there was none so I wrote one up at 3am, and then it was removed due last week and I just wanted to repost it when the 4th episode came out.

    this is definitely a diamond in the rough. mostly due to its jarring art style which can throw some people off. if you can get past this its definitely one the greats of all time. <br />

shows similar to this would be like one piece and ore imo because each have their own little thing that could rub people the wrong way. one piece with its art style and ore imo with its topic in the title.<br />
<br />
High score girl is so empowering and fulfilling to watch it literally takes all the good aspects of a good shounen as well as complementing it with superb comedy from

          <span style="display: none;" id="review326150">
        the rom com aspect. every episode is a treat and really is a pleasure to watch. i would actually just like get amnesia so i can experience it again in its novelty. <br />
<br />
the inclusion of the greats from voice acting means you already know youre in for a good time. hell they even put the voice actor of kirito as one of the SUPER SIDE CHARACTERS THAT NEVER SHOWS UP BASICALLY. if a studio can afford that you know its going to be good. <br />
<br />
definitely storytelling from this anime is so good its definitely a must watch for anyone who wants a good time. let the anime tell the story and not my review. great coming of age story. best romance of the century. cheers.

    Sheer mediocrity hiding under clichéed nostalgia.<br />
<br />
I had decent enough expectations for this anime, since gaming is by far my biggest passion and this series has a relatively high score by MAL standards.<br />
The lesson, as always, is &quot;have no expectations whatsoever&quot;. Let&#039;s get to it.<br />
<br />
[For the sake of it I&#039;ll be covering S1 along with the Extra Stage stuff. There&#039;s nothing to spoil as the story is phoned-in from the very first episode, go ahead without any fear.]<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go on to rate every single aspect of the anime, since it&#039;s largely pointless: I&#039;ll focus instead on its two biggest failures: characters and &quot;story&quot;.<br />
<br />
Characters first. Well,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review325877">
        it&#039;s like the authors watched Hinamatsuri and Kaguya-sama and thought &quot;oh, which are the least likable traits of the female protagonists? Yes, let&#039;s just join them together!&quot;. The &quot;protagonist&quot; (or co-protagonist) is Akira Oono (hereon referred to as just Oono), and she has 3 traits: she never talks, she has a difficult family situation and she likes videogames. I really struggle to call eye-rolling things such as these as &quot;traits&quot; but that&#039;s pretty much the whole of it (and add your usual &quot;very violent&quot; and &quot;eats like a hippo&quot; traits, the Japanese are nothing if not consistent with those two). And here lies the biggest problem. She&#039;s not a compelling character. Nor is she an interesting character. The fact that she never talks (not because she can&#039;t, just &quot;cos muh artistic visiuuunnn&quot;) doesn&#039;t make her endearing in the slightest, to me. The fact that she has a very strict &quot;home-teacher&quot; and her parents don&#039;t care about her situation and BLAHBLAHBLAAAAHHHH yeah I&#039;m sorry but can we get over this stupid &quot;cute rich girl with meanie weanie parents&quot;? As I mentioned before, somehow it was supposed to make Kaguya relatable when she just looked like a rich obnoxious brat with no common sense to speak of. Oono isn&#039;t as bad as Kaguya from that point of view, but the whole &quot;wah rich girl sad background&quot; is so sodding clichéed it&#039;s just unbearable. I&#039;m supposed to feel sorry for this kid who never utters a single word and hey, I bloody don&#039;t. Give her an actual character next time because looking pretty and making various facial expressions isn&#039;t a sufficient replacement for one.<br />
<br />
The other co-protagonist is Yaguchi, another pile of clichées. His thing is that he&#039;s obsessed with videogames. I thought I&#039;d find him at the very least relatable, since I&#039;ve been gaming well over half my life but christ almighty, there&#039;s a very fine difference between &quot;normal&quot; obsession and whatever this kid has. Games are the only thing on his mind and I&#039;m not even being facetious here, he can&#039;t think of anything else, it&#039;s genuinely mind-boggling. I&#039;ve known many people who were really obsessed with games but even the worst hikikomori would look at this brat and be like &quot;woah mate, give gaming a rest for a while&quot;. Everything he does, it&#039;s for gaming. You don&#039;t have to wonder about his motivations, he always does something &quot;cos vidyas&quot;. Other than that he&#039;s the usual braindead Japanese teen who couldn&#039;t find his own arsehole if someone else stuck his head in it, the classic &quot;oh, is that love&quot; &quot;oh, are these feelings&quot; BS that&#039;s been done ad nauseam in much subtler and better ways.<br />
<br />
While I get to the third character I might as well talk about the story. There really isn&#039;t one. This anime was clearly made thinking &quot;we must make something about games and that sweet nostalgia, shoe-in some characters and a semblance of a plot and we got game guys&quot; and boy, does it show. Within the first two episodes, without knowing anything of the anime itself I was already wondering where the third wheel was at. And there she comes, spurned love aka third wheel aka best girl who&#039;s as dumb as a stump, Koharu Hidaka. I feel sorry for her character, she&#039;s not really much more developed than any of the others but falling in love with a complete useless nobody like Yaguchi must really royally suck. There, I&#039;ve told you all about her already, she&#039;s the needed impediment between the Oono-Yaguchi &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;love&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; story, she&#039;s there to fulfill her role and does so admirably too, but that&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a smattering of other minor mostly useless people, like the old kind driver (and his incredibly hilarious running gag of running over Yaguchi with his car LOLOL), supporting character and unsurprising nobody Miyao, arrogant comic relief Doi, sympathetic do-it-all perfect mother Yaguchi-san, irritating perverted twat Onizuka and mischievous laissez-faire Oono onee-sama.<br />
<br />
I&#039;d talk more about the story but there really isn&#039;t one. It&#039;s just various boring &quot;conflicts&quot; that pace what otherwise would be a full-on gaming commercial for the 80s and 90s. No doubt people who lived in that era will appreciate it because somehow recognising something that made us happy (&quot;oh hey, I DID THAT TOO BRUH&quot;) equals to the thing mentioning it as being good, too. But yes, the story. Yaguchi meets Oono at an arcade, she&#039;s better than him (he never beats her) and he gets obsessed with showing her her place while she clearly wants to show him something else entirely. There are various pauses in this...relationship, such as when she&#039;s sent to Europe for what, two years as a primary school student (who doesn&#039;t do that after all, ah these rich peeps, I swear) at which point the third wheel, Hidaka, gets to know Yaguchi and obviously falls in love with someone who not only hasn&#039;t yet discovered what his wee-wee does, since it&#039;s not gaming-related, but has barely any care for any other person other than himself. Who wouldn&#039;t fall in love with such a compelling person, AMIRITEGUYS?!? After that, just insert various problems of poor rich kid Oono who&#039;s come back from Europe (or wherever she&#039;d been sent to in order to advance the plot) which end up with her running away from home (yes, I know, shocking development) and eventually her tyrannical home-teacher changing her mind without any reason to (literally nothing new had happened, the plot decided that the same reasons she&#039;d refused for years were now good enough to accept because the season had to end) and everyone getting their happy little ending because that&#039;s really how life works.<br />
<br />
I&#039;m honestly surprised myself at how pathetically poor this anime is. There really isn&#039;t much else to prop it up either; art and animation are borderline dreadful, among the worst (and laziest) I&#039;ve watched in a while. Not the worst because crapfests like Asura and Kemurikusa exist but that&#039;s not really saying much. Voice acting is fine for the most part, other than Yaguchi being miscast horribly because not only they told Amasaki to give his most irritating voice possible, but a primary school kid should always sound like an over-30 something who&#039;s smoking a packet a day. Obviously. I won&#039;t even talk of the crime of using Suzushiro, who was a wonderful Uruka Takemoto, just in order to have her mumble some sounds here and there in 16 episodes. Music&#039;s fine and the ED is decent too, so I guess there&#039;s that.<br />
<br />
Oh, final point on how sodding blunt this thing is. In fact, it&#039;s about as subtle as a bull in a china shop, with its highest moment coming when whoever (maybe it was the onee-sama) says &quot;videogames are so nice, they bring people together and help everyone&quot; or some **** like that. Like, what kind of ****ing writing is that? What&#039;s next? &quot;Breathing is good, stealing is bad&quot;? Christ, none of the writers of this anime ever heard the sentence &quot;show don&#039;t tell&quot;, or they heard it and applied it in the worst ways imaginable.<br />
<br />
And that&#039;s it. If you lived in those gaming years and you spent your life in the arcades  (as if anyone who did that wouldn&#039;t be living under a bridge now) and/or if you&#039;re one of those all-knowing hipsters who natter on how gaming was better in the olden days then, hey, you&#039;ll probably love this. Anyone else though, unless you really want some cheap *everything* with a videogames theme and aren&#039;t allergic to clichées, I&#039;d stay away from this one without a second thought.

    (No Spoilers)<br />
Look this is the first review that I will be putting effort into so it may not be amazing. <br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
<br />
High Score Girl is a unique show that takes on multiple genres the reason I decided to make my first review on High Score Girl is that I found it very special how it was able to change in just a single episode which isn&#039;t a bad thing<br />
The first two episodes made it seem as if it would be a comedy about a girl and boy playing arcade games but as the show develops you see how it can change from a comedy to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332044">
        a drama and then into a romance in the matter of a few episodes you start to become invested not only into the characters but the world this show just makes you feel like a kid again Yaguchi reminds me of when I was a selfish little kid who was too into video games to care about the world around me Yaguchi is a well-built character his character is quite literally built of video games he starts as a selfish kid who only cares for video games but as the show progress he starts to grow up and care for the people around him he starts putting more effort into things that aren&#039;t video games <br />
<br />
Art 6/10<br />
<br />
Not a big fan of the animation style that was used but it wasn&#039;t horrible or unwatchable<br />
<br />
Sound 8/10<br />
<br />
I love the opening and the ending <br />
The opening is just a bop<br />
And the ending feels like a sweet and beautiful lullaby <br />
<br />
Characters 9/10<br />
<br />
Yaguchi is a relatable character for anyone who has played video games while growing up his development is shown well during the progression of the show<br />
<br />
Oono is a cute silent girl as she appears but her character is a lot deeper than that she has her life decided by others and the only way she escapes is by playing video games <br />
<br />
Hidaka is a hard character to describe I think its easier to understand her character if you were to watch the show <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
<br />
I got invested quickly I love everything about it the characters the video games this is definitely something you should check out<br />
<br />
Overall 9/10

    High Score Girl&#039;s soul fundamentally lies in it&#039;s throwback setting to the golden age of arcades, the fighting genre and videogames in general, but the show doesn&#039;t use this setting as a crutch but rather makes something special out of it.<br />
<br />
Yaguchi is an arcade/videogame addict who self-proclaims that  his only value as a person is his talent in video games, so he always spends his time in arcade, beating other people and feeling good about himself. So naturally a girl named Oono comes and beats the sh*t out of him, both figuratively and literally, story ensues.<br />
  The show mainly uses videogames as a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290398">
        parallel to our world, but it&#039;s not forced, so it makes the show feel more legit and realistic. The main story on the other hand is more about the youth of these particular characters and how their interaction with each other affect them. It&#039;s basically a romance story with slice-of-life influences and video games as a bit of fanservice (and advertisements, a lot).<br />
<br />
The very first moment I went into the show I immediately hated how anything looked, because this show unfortunately uses low-quality cg in it&#039;s art direction which is always concerning when it comes to anime. It&#039;s sad to know that this show will always look old and dated, as it already looks dated even today. But then things seemed to get better looking as the episodes went on, not sure if I was just getting used to the awful cg but then I realized what actually was going on.<br />
 The thing is, in stark contrast to it&#039;s low quality cg, this show actually has surprisingly good cinematography and atmosphere, provided by some nicely laid out background art. You&#039;re never confused as to where the characters are in relation to each other, it gives the show that visual depth to make the onscreen action believable.<br />
 It&#039;s snowing outside... we quickly rush into a local shop and play some video games as we catch some heat, it&#039;s cozy as hell.<br />
<br />
Even though one of the biggest reasons why I enjoyed this show is undoubtedly the characters, and they are decently written characters, when I look back I come to realize they were&#039;nt really anything too exceptional. Rather, it&#039;s more interesting how these characters interact with each other, and how they shape each other as people as the show goes on, it&#039;s quite fun to see how much Oono changes Yaguchi as a person.<br />
<br />
My main problem with the show is that it doesn&#039;t have any finality to it, as it quite simply can&#039;t since the manga is stil going. There will be two more episodes coming though (with the BD release if I&#039;m not wrong) so maybe those will give some completeness to the show, but with the manga still going, I doubt it.<br />
<br />
High School Girl gets a strong 7.<br />
 While nothing too special, it&#039;s still a show I very much enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who likes cute romance stories, SoL and video games. It&#039;s definitely worth watching if you&#039;re into the genre.

    The &#039;90&#039;s sure were revolutionary for gamers around the world and it gets protrayed pretty well in High School Girl. As someone that has is from the end &#039;80&#039;s myself, I sure do remember it very slghty back then while I was still wetting the bed.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
The story sets off in 1991 when Street Fighter 2 gets released. But this animle is not really about games. It&#039;s more your generic love romance triangle story if you really have to boil it down with a lot of references with classic games like Street Fighter 2 back in the &#039;90&#039;s. Since I never really played Street

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290509">
        Fighter 2 myself since I was too young back in the day and I&#039;m also not quite familiair with the whole francise. The closest of the series I had played for a bit was Street Fighter 3D Edition for the Nintendo 3DS. I&#039;m more of a Tekken guy myself.<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
The art-style is one of my biggest turn-off for this show for a show that&#039;s been made in the current year of 2018. When I saw the first episode, it was hard to decide I would contineu the series or not and to be honest; I don&#039;t really like to drop an anime just after one episode. But I somehow got used to it. It still doesn&#039;t mean I adore it. It feels so cartoony and blocky to me. <br />
<br />
Sound: 8 (Very Good)<br />
If you want to feel nogalistic about the &#039;90&#039;s and you have played games from that era, this show got you covered. It&#039;s pretty much it&#039;s main selling point if you ask me. All those gaming sounds surely makes you long for the &#039;90&#039;s a bit again.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
The charaters are however quite like-able, but what bothered really me the most is that Oono (one of our main carathers) havent said a single word in the entire show. Is she shy? Is she mute? It never got explained why in the anime and it feels you&#039;re pretty much forced to perhaps read the manga to get more answers.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment 5/10 (Average)<br />
Over time I started to enjoy this show however, even with all the neatives I told you before. But that&#039;s maybe because I&#039;m a romantic type of guy. Don&#039;t judge me. I also got a chuckle every now and then with our MC the video game addict. Another big turn-off for me was they have putted every now and then a commercial in the middle of the episode about the latest games that are coming out or are already out for on the Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 and such and I really feel the need to adress this, because this is a turn-off to me. I&#039;m here to watch anime, not to be a consumer.<br />
<br />
Overall: 6/10 (Fine)<br />
Despite with all it&#039;s negatieves, it was a good watch I guess. This show has it&#039;s flaws for sure, but if you&#039;re into arcade games and old-school gaming from the &#039;90&#039;s and like a bit of (triangle) romance, this would be your anime to watch. High Score Girl gets from me an overal score of 6/10.

    I&#039;m so very confused by all the love for this anime. I&#039;m shocked. Here&#039;s my honest minimal spoiler review:<br />
<br />
Let me go ahead and point out: I&#039;m not a fan of romance. I do like video games, and I&#039;m the perfect age to ride the nostalgia train of this anime. <br />
<br />
But, I just don&#039;t get it.  (VERY SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD) The plot is a dumb little boy and a smart little girl. DUmb boy is only good at games, failing in school. Little girl intelligent and from a nice family, but is physically abusive and very violent, but never speaks. He speaks out loud verbally

          <span style="display: none;" id="review298066">
        dissecting what he thinks her actions mean. They both play games, bond over it, but he&#039;s a young brat that doesn&#039;t realize he&#039;s building a relationship (he just sees her as a rival). She moves. Two years later another girl enters his life, less of a gamer. She shows interest in him romantically, but he is young and dumb and doesn&#039;t see it. Time progresses, other girl comes back, romantic drama ensues. (END OF SPOILERS)<br />
<br />
STORY: 4/10 The story is a fairly generic love story, I don&#039;t see the appeal. If you like love stories maybe you will enjoy this. It just isn&#039;t for me. <br />
<br />
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 4/10 Meh. Dumb boys grow up, girls learn how to be a little more forward. It&#039;s average anime character growth, nothing ground breaking here. <br />
<br />
ART: 1/10 Absolutely the worst CG anime I have ever witnessed. It is not my cup of tea. It makes me feel sea sick trying to watch it. They don&#039;t move fluidly in their space, the faces look like decals slapped to a vinyl figure, the hands are always awkward. HATE. The cuts between old games and this CG nonsense breaks any attention I had for the show. I don&#039;t feel immersed because of the breaks. I honestly think if the art was traditional anime I would enjoy this series a lot more. I&#039;m not going to dwell on this, may you will like it. <br />
<br />
SOUND: 8/10 I love the sound! The opening and ending tracks are beautiful. Voice actors are great. Not ground breaking, but it&#039;s good stuff!<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 2 I think I&#039;m immune to love stories and nostalgia. I honestly don&#039;t see how anyone can get past the awful art of this series. After forcing myself through dizziness and nausea of the art on multiple occasions, I just started listening to it/catching glimpses as I did chores around the house. I couldn&#039;t devote sit down relax time to this show. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Not for those who dislike romance and shows playing off nostalgia alone. <br />
<br />

high score girl is a good anime now after finishing all the episodes its my favorite anime of the year aside from the animation every thing is awesome. even though the story seems to be moving slowly but you never want it to end. the sweet budding romance between oono and yaguchi totally wants you to root for them. also the background score is good and the ending song is cute as hell. and it gets very emotional at the moment you least expect which pulls your Heart Strings.what makes this so enjoyable is the heartwarming interaction between

the protagonist is one who is not popular &amp; not good in studies but he is a very good gamer in the arcade nobody could beat him . which nobody in the class knows. on the other hand we have oono she is beautiful popular every one in the class have fantasy about her being what she does in home ranging from reading books in the library to playing piano. but to his surprise oono comes to the arcade &amp; she destroys him in the only thing he is good at and after many tries he beat her.then she hits him from then on they become rivals and gradually friends.

    Before I begin my review, there is something I want to write. I have watched the anime (well 5 episodes for now, cause it seems the anime is still airing) , and read the manga (49 chapters). I will try to keep my review to the anime only, but there is something, and that&#039;s I don&#039;t trust this review. I don&#039;t want to spoil it for people who will read the manga. But when newer episodes come, this review may no longer hold.<br />
<br />
But for now, it&#039;s a typical heartwarming anime, a good one, but not one with much to talk about. Oh and yes, these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286748">
        ratings only apply to the anime&#039;s story, not manga I&#039;ve read.<br />
<br />
Story(7/10) : Kind of hard to decide, as it really doesn&#039;t have much of a story. It&#039;s pretty much a boy and a girl. The boy doesn&#039;t care about anything but games, so he&#039;s dense to the girl&#039;s feelings. That really is just it. There is one more girl too, but they didn&#039;t even meet yet (but they might in the oncoming episodes). It&#039;s heartwarming and cute.<br />
<br />
Art(4/10) : Can&#039;t really defend this. Just look at it.<br />
<br />
Sound(6/10) : It&#039;s fair, I suppose. Not much to complain about, but not that great either.<br />
<br />
Character(8.5/10) : This is good, especially considering the genre. The game crazy boy,  a rich &quot;ojou-sama&quot; who also happens to be a crazy gamer, and one more girl who&#039;s just a cute normie. And then there&#039;s protoganist&#039;s mom. BEST MOM EVER !!!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment(7.5/10) : Pretty cute and heartwarming. Quite enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Overall(7.5/10) : I suggest it.

    With the number of anime that air per season, even with the large amount of anime fans, it’s a given that some shows will simply fall through the cracks. I feel that High Score Girl is one of those shows.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I found High Score Girl a hidden gem of this anime season. Not a diamond, mind you, but gem, nonetheless (think topaz).<br />
<br />
High Score Girl tells the story of Haruo Yagauichi, a crude slacker, and Akira Oono, the academically talented heiress to a wealthy family. What ties these seemingly incongruent characters together is their mutual love for video games.<br />
<br />
And if you, the viewer, love

          <span style="display: none;" id="review290440">
        classic video games, you’ll love High Score Girl, which is a love letter to 90s gaming. Both the arcade and console scenes are given love. If you played the games of this time or simply are tied to decade, you’ll be hit with a blast of nostalgia. I personally adore video games, so even though, unlike Haruo, I’m not big on fighting games, I still got to geek out. It was also nice seeing time progress and seeing Haruo gush over new releases. The anime does move forward in time (going from upper-elementary to the first year of Japanese highschool (sophomore year in America), and the anime utilizes this passage of time well.<br />
<br />
The main characters are written surprisingly well, with Haruo not being quite as dense as you’d expect for an MC of his personality. Oono is hands-down one of the cutest characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of viewing. Her violent tendencies, while annoying at times, don’t really detract from her character. Unlike some people, it doesn’t make her insufferable, and somehow makes her even more cute. Her biggest shtick is that she doesn’t speak, ever. While this can prove frustrating for some viewers, I think the show worked around it well. If I had more money, I’d get her nendoroid.<br />
<br />
...then there’s Hidaka.<br />
<br />
The anime’s a romance, which comes into play very soon. It’s a cute romance and the couple is one of the best I’ve seen. While the anime doesn’t pussyfoot the relationship in the beginning, it quickly loses steam as, you guessed it, a third player joins the game. Enter Hidaka, a member of Haruo’s class who quickly develops a crush on him as he introduces her to the wonderful world of gaming. <br />
<br />
While it could be seen as a “spoiler” that there’s a love triangle, I think it’s only fair to inform you all. Love triangles generally bog down a show, and High Score Girl isn’t spared...kind of. As a main character, Hidaka is quite fleshed out and she’s sure to have her fans. However, the show makes it painfully obvious that Oono is the endgame, yet a large portion is dedicated to Hidaka and Haruo. While she’s not a bad character, her inclusion seems to just take away from Oono’s. In my opinion the love triangle doesn’t really add a new dimension to the plot. It doesn’t detract from it either, but that just makes it seem kind of unnecessary.<br />
<br />
That said, the show’s still good. <br />
<br />
The main thing High Score has going against it is that there isn’t much more to it. What you see is what you get. If you like video games and romance, you’ll probably love this show. If you like one or the other, it might be a bit of slog. If you like neither, there won’t be much for you. Even if you do like both, the show still seems to be missing something. The side characters are inoffensive, at best. Midway through the show, I simply had the feeling that High Score Girl was adequate. It wasn’t bad, no, but it wasn’t great either. I didn’t find myself compelled to watch episodes right away. Still, it picked up again.<br />
<br />
The music is pretty great, but the art might prove a sticking point. The show is completely CGI, which is sure to be a turn-off for some viewers. Watching it can feel off at times. If you like the story, you’ll learn to get used to it. For what it’s worth, it’s pretty harmless.<br />
<br />
I can’t comment on the ending because it ends on a cliffhanger, with the final episodes premiering in march of next year.<br />
<br />
While the show is far from perfect, as a video game and romance fan, High Score Girl scratched an itch I never knew I had, and I’ll be sure to watch the show’s conclusion.<br />
<br />

    First time to write a review on an anime that I have watched.<br />
<br />
This is an anime that will be most appreciated by those who lived and played the arcade games and saw the rise of of home consoles in that era.<br />
<br />
What compiled me to write a short review is that the nostalgia factor is so great.<br />
For someone who has been playing arcade games since the time of Galaga, 1942, etc, the arcade golden years for me was when SF2 World Warrior was released in 1991 and it was the best and the king of fighting games at that time.<br />
<br />
I like the character emotional development of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406125">
        the 3 main characters and also how all the supporting character helped the main character grow.<br />
<br />
Haruo&#039;s emotional character development is very good. From someone, who just loves games and aims to be the best at what he loves (playing video games), eventually matured and acknowledged that all is not about the video games.<br />
Oblivious also, to the point of being stupid, as he was not able to feel what the girls around her feels about her, until he emotionally mature. <br />
I guess boys at that age really mature at different rates as seen how Miyao was seeing things that Haruo isn&#039;t able to see.<br />
<br />
Akira Ono&#039;s innate skills in using the hardest players to use for vs battles shows her character and attitude. <br />
It&#039;s insane and cute to see a character able to express her feelings without words.<br />
She&#039;s tenacious in her own way and shows that she will not give up what she loves as well (Kidnapped Haruo, tried to find Haruo in Shibuya alone, faced Hidaka 1-on-1).<br />
 <br />
Hidaka is my most favorite character. While she did not win her love, she is the most mature character in the series and even delivered the most important scene which is to knock sense to Haruo in the final moments.<br />
Mature in a sense that 1. She did everything she could to express her love. 2. She fought for it as well 3. She is matured enough to accept that fact that Haruo and Ono was already able to forge a sort of an unbreakable bond, even before she noticed and fell in love with Haruo.<br />
<br />
I love how the history of arcade games and home based console development was also infused in the story - circa 1991-1996.<br />
If you have played arcade games from mid 1980&#039;s to late 1990&#039;s, you will love this series. <br />
You even be able relate to the emotional story of the 3 main characters.<br />
<br />
Animation and CGI: 9/10 (I also enjoyed the snipets after the ending credits on Season 1)<br />
Character development: 9/10<br />
Nostalgia factor: 10/10<br />
History: 9/10<br />
Story: 9/10<br />
Overall fun factor: 9/10
