The over-the-top characters play a big part in this. Guy Shishio is a badass without even trying. He&#039;s a man&#039;s man, who&#039;ll never give up, no matter how difficult the odds. While this kind of character is a staple for super robot shows, Guy takes hot-blooded to new levels with his ridiculous screaming, speeches, and Zonder-breaking. He&#039;s a static character, but he&#039;s so likable that you don&#039;t really mind. I don&#039;t usually faun over voice actors, but Nobuyuki Hiyama (you&#039;ll know him as Viral from TTGL and Link from the Zelda games) does an excellent job. His yells and dramatic speeches have real weight behind them-they&#039;ll blow you away. Guy&#039;s English voice, Michael Sinterhisnameistoocomplicatedtospell does a very commendable job filling out Guy&#039;s shoes-I&#039;d send him a bottle of throat spray if I could.<br />
<br />
 The rest of the human characters are relatively stock as well, but none of them are forgettable-especially Taiga, the Commander of the Gutsy Geroid Guard&#039;s Japanese branch. You owe it to yourself to watch this show, if only to see his dramatic pointing. Really, that guy can point. Despite the male-oriented nature of the show, there are plenty of strong female characters who play their part in the GGG epic, and aren&#039;t just fanservice, either. Guy&#039;s girlfriend and technical support also plays a role that you won&#039;t expect. One of the few characters that gets some decent development  is the magical boy protagonist Mamoru-a refugee from an alien civilization that is the key to victory on more than one occasion. I can hear you groaning already, but trust me-you&#039;ll learn to love him more than you ever thought you would.<br />
<br />
 Like Transformers before it, the robot members of the GGG (you&#039;re going to see that letter a lot, so get used to it)  are characters as well. They&#039;re sentient, and have distinct (and cheesy) personalities, from the ninja police car intelligence agent Volfogg (yes, this is an amazing combination, and unlike vodka and soy milk, it will not give you a headache) to the American-made rock-and-roll bard-class bot Mic Sounders XIII. Even though they&#039;re stock characters and, well, robots, you end up feeling for them.<br />
<br />
The titular robot, while not sentient itself (or is it), has a character all its own.  In the beginning of the show, GaoGaiGar moves like a creaky, slapped together bucket of bolts-it&#039;s been hastily built to defend the earth from the approaching threat from space, and it shows. The signature combination sequence barely works, and the finishing move, Hell and Heaven, damages GaoGaiGar and is slowly killing its pilot. Even until the end, GaoGaiGar cannot handily defeat any enemy without the help of the other members of the team, and the clever way the writers find a way for it to win despite its limitations serve as a handy way to break up the monotony that usually plagues shows like this. <br />
<br />
The silly-looking design aesthetic that permeates GGG (the robot) and the show doesn&#039;t detract from how brutal it can be. GaoGaiGar breaks its enemies in the most literal fashion every episode. Even with the over-the-top antics, the show separates itself from other super robot shows, and the other Yuusha/Brave series by grounding it with a sense of plausibility and strict continuity that you don&#039;t see in a lot of anime. One look at the gorgeously animated stock transformation sequence is proof of the ridiculous attention to detail in GaoGaiGar. While most super robots are known for their &quot;unpossible&quot; transformations, GaoGaiGar is covered in tiny vents, treads, panels and blinking lights that you&#039;ll only catch for a glimpse. Even the inside was completely drawn out in the concept art, and you can see the mechanical designs (even for a pink VW van!), along with fictional specifications in the eyecatches. All of this comes to a frothy, delicious head with the few plot twists and &quot;keys to victory&quot; scattered through the series. When you see some of them, you&#039;ll gasp, and want to go back and look for them in every episode. It gets even more ridiculous when a seemingly useless and innocuous prop becomes the key to victory in the spectacular OVA GaoGaiGar Final! (Seriously, you&#039;ll shit a brick.)<br />
<br />
The music is nothing short of a triumph. There&#039;s an amazing leitmotif going throughout, from the &quot;Final Fusion&quot; gattai scene to the GGG&#039;s theme, and of course, Mic Sounder&#039;s amazing power up songs. You&#039;ll be humming them on the way to work or school.<br />
<br />
All of the pieces of the show coalesce into something both familiar and wonderful. You know a series is worth watching when you wonder what you ever did before you&#039;d seen it, and GGG is one of the rare anime titles that I&#039;d put up on that lofty pedestal. It&#039;s a true labor of love, filled with fanservice for every stripe. Like the show itself, the message of courage and perseverance might seem cheesy at first, but it not only grows on you, but envelops you, in a way that few other shows can.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s must see for super robot fans, and I&#039;d encourage everyone to buy the DVDs. If you know me well, you know that I don&#039;t like paying for anime. Fuck Luffy, I&#039;m the true Pirate King. If you see an anime DVD on my shelf, then you know I think it&#039;s not only worth the money, but one worth celebrating. It&#039;s probably the highest praise I can give any series.<br />
<br />
Any effort this grand deserves to be compensated for. I highly recommend it.

    King of the Braves GaoGaiGar most definitely earns its title of King. This show is everything right with a super robot anime. GaoGaiGar has a fun story, colorful cast of humans and robots and it&#039;s loud, blood boiling, in-your-face action that makes you want to yell attack names along with the show. So with all that said, lets get to review. FINAL FUSION, APPROVED.<br />
<br />
Story 9/10<br />
The story is a basic Super Robot anime. It revolves around the members of Gusty Geoid Guard, Or GGG for short, as they deal with attacks from the Zonders, who are an alien machine race. The first 25 episodes are pretty

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179455">
        standard monster of week, which mostly serve as a way to slowly introduce new characters and weapons for GGG. Please be aware that this show was meant to sell toys. After that though, the series begins to grow and the real plot begins to unfold, and that is where it really shines.<br />
<br />
Art 10/10<br />
The Art is very well done for a show done in the late 90&#039;s. It has well defined lines and bright vivid colors which create very crisp visuals. Everything in this show has its own identity and nothing blurs together.<br />
<br />
Sound 10/10<br />
Oh, this is what makes a super robot go from good to fantastic. GaoGaiGar has some of the best sounds and OST in any anime I have watched; and I have heard stuff from aldnoah.zero and Attack On Titan. Every sound from Golion&#039;s roar to the G stone charging up is uniquely its own. I especially liked the sound they use for the machine noises when robots are combining. GaoGiaGar also has a great OST. Evey character has his or her theme song to go with them; the most memorable being GaoGaiGar Final Fusion theme. The voice work in GaoGaiGar is top notch with Hiyama Nobuyuki voicing Guy. I just loved hearing him yell out, &quot;HIKARI NI NARA!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Characters 10/10<br />
With every Super Robot anime the selling point is the robots and GaoGaiGar delivers it in tenfolds. The hero of this story is a cyborg named Guy who is a man&#039;s man boiling to the brim with courage and bravery who is also a symbol of hope to everyone else. Guy is also accompanied by fellow brave robots, the twin rescue brothers HyoRyu, who claim collective and his hothead brother EnRyu who is a shoot first ask questions kind of person. There is also the Ninja Police Intelligence Officer Volfogg. On the human side the most predominate would be Mamoru. Hes a kid with the unlikely ability to purify the Zondar cores. There are many more but you get the idea, its a colorful cast of robots and people that you can&#039;t help but love.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really did enjoy GaoGaiGar. It delivers on everything that a Super Robot Show should. Yeah, there are faults. Namely, it takes time to build up to its main plot point. If you can&#039;t stand monster of the week formula, it probably won&#039;t do much for you, but if you enjoy over-the-top crazy robot fights with yelling and more courage than you can handle, this is the show for you.<br />
Gutsy Geoid Guard, Mobilize!<br />
10/10

    I went into GaoGaiGar with extremely hign expectations. This series is praised nonstop for being the greatest super robot show ever made. I constantly heard that the series had some of the manliest characters, coolest mecha and one best endings in all of super robot anime.<br />
<br />
[STORY]<br />
When I first began to watch the show I was pretty dissapointed. The early episodes of this series aren&#039;t exactly bad, but they sure are mediocore. The biggest problem in GaoGaiGar is the pacing. The first 25 episodes are barely worth watching, they&#039;re meant to introduce the cast characters I&#039;m sure, but story wise not much happens. Its really formuliac

          <span style="display: none;" id="review10920">
        stuff, kinda like you&#039;d expect out of a 70&#039;s super robot show. Each episode follows the same grind of a monster appearing, GaoGaiGar swoops in to save the day and uses a new move.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t blame anyone for missing out these episodes all together. You won&#039;t miss anything, and after episode 25 the story becomes much more fast paced and interesing. Still, the series never quite shakes this monster of the week formula, and if that isn&#039;t your thing GaoGaiGar probably isn&#039;t for you, unless you have a whole lot of dedication.<br />
<br />
[ART]<br />
I was initially put off by the designs in this series. The character designs are very basic, especially the many annoying kid characters, who all look like they&#039;ve stumbled into the wrong show. The mecha designs are something you&#039;ll either love or hate. Their done by Kunio Okawara, who&#039;s well known for doing the designs for most of the Brave series. His designs aren&#039;t anything new, very blocky, and have more of a resemblence to Transformers than the works of Go Nagai like most SR shows have. The titular GaoGaiGar has a nice design, but the rest, especially the villains, were a bit basic for my tastes.<br />
<br />
The animation itself isn&#039;t terrible, the best of it ussually saved for those truly epic scenes every now and then, but there is an overeliance of re-used animation. Towards the end of the series I was becoming really bored of seeing the same damn attacks over and over again! I realise that this is common in mecha, but there have been plenty of SR shows which didn&#039;t rely on stock footage nearly as heavily as this series.<br />
<br />
[SOUND]<br />
They&#039;re isn&#039;t much to write home about in this department. The OP itself is brilliant, but other than that it was pretty bland. Still I can&#039;t say anything harmed my senses.<br />
<br />
[CHARACTER]<br />
The biggest annoyance in this categorie were the child characters. They were supposed to be cute, but Mamoru and his friends often come off as more annoying than that. By the end of the series these characters do mature a bit, but they still got way too much screentime throughout the series.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cast was pretty mixed. The protaganists are nothing you wouldn&#039;t expect out of a super robot series, and neither are the villains. I only wish they&#039;d spent more time fleshing out some of the more interesting members of GGG, rather than just Guy and Mamoru all the time. Towards the end of the series I found myself appreciating some of the characters more, but over all it was a pretty bland cast.<br />
<br />
[OVERALL]<br />
Obviously, I went into GaoGaiGar with high expectations and was dissapointed. Its not the worst Super Robot show, but its by no means the best. There are moments greatness in this series. The last ten episodes especially are filled with everything I could want out of a series like this, tension, outlandish battles, manly speaches and heroic sacrafice.<br />
<br />
But that doesn&#039;t make up for the huge amounts of filler in this show, and the blandness of some of the characters and mecha. Its a fairly enjoyable series, worthy of its place in the super robot pantheon, just be sure to realise that it might not be worth ALL the praise it gets.<br />
<br />
The best way to watch this show is in small chunks, on a saturday morning, turning your brain off and just enjoying the many manly screams of<br />
&amp;quot;FINAL FUSION!&amp;quot;

    I bet you can&#039;t name too many other entries in the Brave franchise, of which GGG is a part. (Others include Might Gaine, J-Decker and Fighbird, if you&#039;re interested.)<br />
<br />
But even so, the King of Braves has achieved almost cult status - getting riffed on in Gun X Sword, featured in multiple Super Robot Wars games and so on. And with good reason. It&#039;s a brilliantly fun show that&#039;s more than the sum of its parts.<br />
<br />
Sure the first 20 or so episodes are so-so formulaic super robot fare which could easily be any other show from the 70s onwards, but that&#039;s part of the charm in

          <span style="display: none;" id="review25145">
        my opinion. The characters are slight but fun - you&#039;ve got a spread of kids from the comedy rich girl and rich boy to the cute damsel in distress and the fat one. You&#039;ve got the heroic super robot team with an all action hero, a mad scientist, a hot girl, and the President. You&#039;ve got your support robots of varying degrees of usefulness.<br />
<br />
And you&#039;ve got the main characters, Guy and Mamoru. They&#039;re good fun, get some good plot development by the second half of the show and ultimately get their happy ending.<br />
<br />
The enemies are well-designed and inventive, with ordinary household objects and industrial equipment transformed into hideous, insane cybernetic monstrosities via a method that could make a good horror movie or Dr Who plot. How many shows have their heroes fighting the LHC one week, a space shuttle in another and a steam train in another, ending up in an epic battle against a cyborg ballerina and a Cthulhu-esque mountain of living metal? It sure beats some of the more uninspired designs featured in Go Nagai or Nagahama shows (while Voltes V and Daimos are good for their own reasons, it&#039;s not monster design.)<br />
<br />
However, it&#039;s after the midpoint of the show that it really kicks off and the ante is upped. A standard mid-season upgrade reveal is handled well and in an exciting way, and the action gets ever-crazier right up to the climactic battle in space.<br />
<br />
Stick with GGG if you&#039;re flagging after the umpteenth one-use gimmick weapon (seriously, the Pliers were awful, even I&#039;ll admit that) or kid-focussed episode. Remember it was originally shown weekly - try watching it that way rather than marathoning it. Get some high-sugar soft drinks, regress to childhood and sing along with the OP - it might make it more enjoyable, I don&#039;t know. Once it finds its stride it&#039;s an exciting action adventure show with some brilliantly excessive mechs.<br />
<br />
Also look out for the, of all things, cameo from Scirocco&#039;s ship. It is in there.

    I had high hopes that I would be sinking into another EPIC mecha-anime because of all the reviews I read about this beforehand. They all said before &quot;Gurren Lagann,&quot; there was GaoGaiGar. What I sunk into, no I mean drowned into was a predictable and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion-like&quot; story downgraded for kiddies. At least now I assuringly know which audience this was targeting, so I&#039;ll give the fairest and most unbiased review I can.<br />
<br />
STORY... The plot of GaoGaiGar is your typical &quot;save the world one day at a time,&quot; except it&#039;s with robots. You&#039;ve got your evil mastermind sending his minions to do his bidding;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30389">
        you&#039;ve got your typical &quot;monster of the week&quot; or in terms of GaoGaiGar, &quot;Zonder of the week.&quot; And with each enemy encounter, the question isn&#039;t if GaoGaiGar will win, it&#039;s HOW GaoGaiGar will win. You can expect power-up, after power-up, after power-up, after power-up, after power-up... (Hence, the &quot;typical cycle&quot;). And just like the sentence before this one, (not the one in parentheses), GaoGaiGar is repetitive... Too repetitive for it&#039;s own good... It attempts to put in some suspense at times by displaying that some actions of one of the heroes does has negative repercussions, but you can easily tell they will find a solution to fix this problem. And so, the &quot;typical cycle&quot; repeats itself with the introduction of new characters joining the fight. Predictable, right?<br />
<br />
For me, the only good points of the plot was with each enemy encounter, you really can sense the degree of difficulty on how to defeat the enemy getting higher and higher or the degree of danger getting higher, however you want to say it. That could possibly spark your interest. The second good point is it&#039;s twist- just when you thought the enemy was defeated, guess again... But that too, was unfortunately it&#039;s downfall because repeating the &quot;typical cycle&quot; for 49 episodes just got a bit boring towards the end. Also, I thought that if the exact opposite thing happened to the heroes (don&#039;t worry, I won&#039;t spoil anything, keep reading) in episode 30 and in the final episode, then GaoGaiGar could have been a candidate for an EXCELLENT series or maybe even EPIC.<br />
<br />
ANIMATION... The animation is a bit dated, but I won&#039;t hold that against it. The robot designs are neatly drawn, and great detail goes into when they perform their transformations. However, a lot of stock footage transformation was used for most of the episodes and you could get bored after seeing it too many times. But you will find yourself amused on how exaggerated characters perform their actions even if it&#039;s just for the simplest things like- Mr. Chief&#039;s jacket wildly blowing in the wind as he gives approval for certain battle actions and how Mikoto Utsugi has to break glass with her fist just to press a button. Now, this works for the first few times, but after a while, it just gets annoying. As for the enemy designs, I can&#039;t help, but think if the designers got lazy towards the end. Watch it for yourself, you&#039;ll see what I mean.<br />
<br />
SOUND... The soundtrack of GaoGaiGar isn&#039;t terribly bad, but it isn&#039;t terribly good either. The opening theme may be annoying to some, but after 8 episodes in, I found myself smiling, thinking to myself, &quot;I&#039;m actually listening to this. Haha...&quot; The ending theme is just okay or should I say &quot;meh?&quot; As for the background music, what can I say? It&#039;s typical of the 90&#039;s? All in all, the soundtrack shouldn&#039;t be too much of a bother while watching.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS... Now, this is what I consider to be the &quot;saving grace&quot; of GaoGaiGar. The main characters are likeable, despite the lack of depth. You&#039;ve got Guy Shishio, your main super hero who displays a fiery courage, along with a boy named Mamoru Amami whose got special powers that help defeat the Zonders, alongside them you&#039;ve got the team 3G whose cast is also entertaining to a certain extent. However, it&#039;s the robots that steal the show, mainly GaoGaiGar&#039;s comrades. GaoGaiGar&#039;s robot comrades were each given distinct, unique human personalities, and seeing them interact with others and their environment will either put a smile on your face or make you laugh. You might even have favorite robots by the time you&#039;re done with the whole series. As for the villains, they are totally one dimensional, just a bunch of dudes always planning to wreak havoc on humanity in whatever way they can. You know, a mastermind wanting to rule the world or universe, something along those lines. Only one villain undergoes character development, but I won&#039;t say who that it is. I don&#039;t like being a spoiler. Haha...<br />
<br />
OVERALL SCORE: 6/10= Above Average<br />
<br />
STRENGTHS<br />
+ Likeable characters, despite lack of depth<br />
+ Introduction of new characters is what keeps the show entertaining somehow.<br />
+ Different types of enemies keeps challenges for the heroes fresh.<br />
<br />
WEAKNESSES<br />
- Predictable plot.<br />
- Too much repetition in some scenes.<br />
<br />
Note: The target audience of this series is obviously kids because kids don&#039;t tend to notice character development, plot twists, or other details that serious anime watchers look at. I recommend this series only and ONLY to a younger audience and for people who really love mechas. As for the other viewers, you&#039;ll be better off not watching this one.

The robot GaoGaiGar is awesome. Awesome weapons.<br />
And the robots in the show are all awesome. Volfogg is especially awesome and badass.<br />
<br />
But just because it bright and enthusiastic, does&#039;nt mean it does&#039;nt get dark. <br />
When it goes dark and sad, it goes for it. It has some truely surprising things in it.<br />
<br />
This anime will put you off space. I hate space. And what happens to Guy Shishioh to make him Cyborg Guy is enough to put me off space even more.<br />
<br />
The fights are all very logical and like a real fight would go. With lots of smashing, hitting, tearing, destroying, and improvisation. Brutal fights.<br />
<br />
It never springs stuff out of the blue. Things are gradually and well written, gradually introduced, and the result is surprising, despite them working up to it.<br />
<br />
It has some unusal things. Like descriptions for the meanings of names and words. Character descriptions at the start and ad breaks.<br />
<br />
One episode is in english and engrish for some of it.<br />
<br />
 And a character who is not japanese, sounds like a none japanese person or person who does&#039;nt live there. She speaks japanese in a fluent, but not native, way.<br />
<br />
The monsters are almost all much bigger and stronger than the leads. So every fight is a true fight to the death. With things against them, other than the big monster, sometimes.<br />
As it goes on, they get bigger and bigger and bigger, till they end up facing massive, powerful, enemies.<br />
<br />
You should definately watch this anime! It is absolutely awesome! :D<br />
<br />

    When I give this thing flat out 10s. It&#039;s for a Reason. I am what is called a &amp;quot;Real Robo Fan&amp;quot;, but this sort of anime can turn anyone out of Reals, or non-mecha Anime fandom, and yank them right in. &amp;quot;Yuusha-Oh GaoGaiGar&amp;quot; brings about a slowly unwinding early story, as the heros are unsure what, or how, to handle their opponents, and the Enemies aren&#039;t simply Caring -that- much about GaoGaiGar until half way through the first half of the series, resulting in many odd or stupid plot devices.<br />
<br />
In the Long run, The series does a great job. The Mecha are all well designed,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review12040">
        the Hero and Mecha all personify the phrases &amp;quot;Super Robot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hot-Blooded&amp;quot;, and the Anime pulls off that Super Robo feel without ever dropping a dime. There&#039;s no mistaking GaoGaiGar as the personification of Bravery, a main theme carried in a majority of Super Robot Animes! The Series ends with one of the best endings ever, as the Hero battles a very unexpected foe despite just having fought the greatest enemy of the series just two episodes earlier. <br />
<br />
I recommend this for anyone with, as Ryusei Date from Super Robot Wars says, &amp;quot;Super Robot Spirit&amp;quot;, and anyone who wishes to experience their first taste of Super-Robo Anime.<br />
<br />
PS: Gotta love the Zaku-Zondar!

    Well, I guess when doing a Hiyama-themed month, there is one show you can’t leave out, isn’t there? A show with such large recognition that most Mecha Anime fans have at least heard of it, the one who gave this actor his nickname (Even Sakurai Masahiro himself is aware of it) and easily his most iconic role to date. That role, of course, belongs to the 1997 Super Robot Anime Yuusha-Ou Gaogaigar.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
I’ll admit, this show does at first suffer from similar issues Might Gaine suffered from. Most notably, remember when I said that none of the episodes were bad but none were great? Yeah, the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review316252">
        same can be applied to this show’s first half. I think the average is slightly higher than that show, but not by much. It is very much episodic, and while the plot does progress, it is done so at a very slow pace, especially in the middle, in which the show feels as if it’s just running through the motions.<br />
<br />
That said there is something that mitigates this issue: The Second half. Around episode 27 or so, the show finally ditches its episodic format, becoming far more serialized, as many mysteries begin to unfold and many previous ones are finally answered. The tone also gets slightly darker, not too much so, but overall things do get serious far more often than before. It all leads to a thematically fitting conclusion that builds itself on what had previously been foreshadowed.<br />
<br />
Yet above all else, Gaogaigar’s greatest strength thought its entire run is, when you get down to it, it is a Reconstruction of the very themes Super Robot shows were composed of. Keep in mind, this show was released right after Neon Genesis Evangelion directly criticized those themes, with the deliberate choice to be a response to it. Here, those critiques are acknowledged, but flipped on its head and shown the many positives on it. That even though those lighthearted shows may be worn down once reality is applied to them, they will persevere because the ideas shown there are still worth fighting for.<br />
<br />
Finally there is something I need to mention: This show is insanely memorable. At the time of writing this, it has been a few years since I watched this show, yet I still remember it as if I finished watching it yesterday. Everything from its characters, to individual scenes, to the soundtrack… it all remains fresh in my mind. It just helps serve as a testament to how timeless this show truly is.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
This is certainly a great cast. Shishio Guy is the example all Super Robot Anime protagonists should follow. The show addresses that the whole mess he’s been put in has taken his toll on him, both physically and mentally speaking. Yet even so, he doesn’t give up. Yes, he does suffer, and yes, it’s implied that behind that mask of happiness he’s not taking things as well as they may seem, but even so, he always recovers, because he’s been given a second chance in life, and because helping people is simply a beautiful thing to do.<br />
<br />
However it’s ironically the tagalong kid Amami Mamoru who gets the most development. While the kid is somewhat mature for his age, he’s still a kid and the show never forgets that. However as the show goes on, he continues to mature, becoming a borderline messianic figure at points. It also helps that, unlike other tagalong kids in Anime, instead of being annoying he is freaking adorable.<br />
<br />
The Supporting cast, both human or otherwise, are all great; special mention goes to Taiga Kotaro, one of the most insane and badass commanders in the genre. As for the villains, they sadly kinda fall into the dull side of things, with more than a few of them not having any real personality to speak of. Still though, they do provide a decent enough threat, and in the end, I could at the very least treat them seriously.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
<br />
I think my thoughts on G Gundam’s animation can similarly be applied to this show. There is a ton of stock footage, but 1) All of it is freaking Sakuga Level, and 2) The non-stock footage stuff looks damn nice. I also love the artstyle, it has a really nice retro feel to it while at the same time feeling updated; think something like Space Battleship Yamato 2199. That’s all I’ve got to say really.<br />
<br />
The Mecha:<br />
<br />
One of the finest I’ve seen. Gaogaigar himself is amazing, though ironically I didn’t care much for its upgrade Star Gaogaigar. All of the Ryu Robots are similarly quite nice, and their combined forms are pretty good. I don’t care much for Mic Sounder’s regular form, but his “True” form looks pretty nice. Ironically my favorite ended up being Volfogg. HE’S A ROBOT NINJA! I don’t care in which universe you live in, that’s awesome! Not as big into Big Volfogg, but he’s still cool.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
The Soundtrack is pretty damn great. All of it has a really nice heroic tone to it, which makes all of the darker pieces stand out even further. To say Endoh Masaki’s “Yuusha-Ou Tanjou” is a masterpiece of a song would be useless, as I shall go on a personal manhunt to anyone who disagrees with that notion. In turn, in spite of being so different, I quite loved “Itsuka Hoshi No Umi De”, ironic given how I often don’t care much for slower Ending themes.<br />
<br />
Voice Acting:<br />
<br />
Well, Hiyama’s playing the lead, and if I could describe it as swiftly as possible, it would be that he’s doing the same performance as with Maito, only cranked up to eleven and it’s amazing.  I don’t know much about Mamoru’s Seiyuu, Itou Makio, but I think that overall she did a pretty decent job. This was also were Konishi Katsuyuki effectively got his big break into voice acting, even if it would take until Guren Lagann for his popularity to truly take off. Special mention to Ishii Kouji, who just goes all out with the Hot-Bloodedness, surpassed only by Hiyama. Besides them, there’s also Iwata Mitsuo, Hanba Tomoe, Egawa Hisao, Madono Mitsuaki and the Late Great Yamaguchi Sayuri. Also fuck the asshole who decided to cancel the Dub after the end of the first story-arc.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
In the end, Gaogaigar isn’t the most complex show ever, but that’s far from a negative. It is a fun ride all the way through to be sure, and I most certainly don’t regret watching it in the slightest. If you’re a fan of Super Robot shows, I implore you to watch this series. It is an unforgettable experience to be sure.<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8/10

    --NO MAJOR SPOILERS are in this review—<br />
<br />
Doing a short review for this one. GaoGaiGar is my first Brave series, and it’s certainly as good as introduction as any. While it does have some flaws of course, GGG is a very fun and creative super robot show overall.<br />
<br />
The first 30 or so eps are dedicated to a MOTW episodic saga that while somewhat slow at times, it does manage to mostly keep interesting by having a unique Zonder every episode. GGG battles are also very creative with the variety of tools/weapons GGG has, the unique gimmicks each Zonder might have that the team has to somehow

          <span style="display: none;" id="review410065">
        beat, in general the stakes being pretty high, monsters actually attacking during the combination sequence, etc. The remaining eps are a lot more interesting with much higher stakes, an emphasis on space combat, and in general crazier battles. I do feel the Primeval plot in the 2nd half was a lot more interesting, and that the first half kind of drags on too long. At times it does feel like this could’ve been just a 35 or so ep series, and that a decent amount of eps are filler-esque. <br />
<br />
Characters are alright, but nothing too great. Mamoru, Kaido and Guy get some good development, and J in particular got some really nice development. The side cast doesn’t really have much depth, but they get the job done. Antags are your typical evil aliens.<br />
<br />
Character, monster, and robot designs are all very nice. Again, there’s a unique Zonder pretty much every ep, and there’s a lot of creative designs for them. There’s a lot of reused stock footage, but at the least it’s very pretty and well animated stock footage. It’s balanced enough well with the new footage each ep that is also very well animated, and there’s some truly pretty stills at least once each ep. <br />
<br />
Music is pretty good with a catchy OP, and soundtrack in general is nice. Voice acting is good, and Noboyuki always knocks it out with his performance as Guy. Maiko does a great job as Mamoru as well.<br />
<br />
Overall, I quite enjoyed GGG. Would def rec to any super robot fan. 7.75/10 series for me.<br />

    A decent series at its time, the appeal of the audience is probably not as good since most of the things that made it good in the past are outdated.<br />
<br />
Out of all the animes I have watched, this is probably the closest to a power ranger series. Protagonist has cliche dialogue, always announces their attacks before initiating it and every 1 or 2 episode is fighting another mecha villain. <br />
<br />
It does has its merits though as the characters are drawn to look every cool and  still has a nice opening even to this day. There is not much else to say about this anime,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review217963">
        but its good if someone just explore the series (you don&#039;t have to watch every episode to be honest) just to see what kids in Japan when this show first premiered really enjoyed.

    GaoGaiGar made the Super Robot genre cool again, but could have been a lot better. It&#039;s an anime of two halves, the second being far superior to the first.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
A bare-bones plot. The villains are corrupting humans to create monsters of the week to eliminate negative thoughts, resulting in a lot of destruction. GaoGaiGar and co. defeat these monsters, and after each battle the human hosts turn back to normal. However, the first 25 episodes don&#039;t do much to advance the plot, so after the 1st episode, you can skip them and not miss much about the plot (all you sacrifice are the heroes&#039; evolution and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88777">
        the monsters.) Seriously, why do we need fight scenes for the sake of fight scenes (that also drag on for too long?) Then after Episode 27, the fights and story both become a lot better. If only Final Fusion was approved right away, things would become far easier!<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Amazing art style. The characters are all drawn with great detail, the monsters of the week go up in massive fireballs and gorgeous pillars of light when they are defeated, and there is CG that sticks out like a sore thumb (notably in the purification scenes.)<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
You won&#039;t forget any of the entire soundtrack. Its quality is up there with Gurren Lagann&#039;s and Star Driver&#039;s. Unfortunately, the mediocre first half never <br />
shuts up (one of the problems Nostalgia Critic covered in his Magic Voyage review), and would be over faster with less Captain Obvious statements and complaining about Guy&#039;s current situations. Combine this with Mikoto&#039;s screaming, and you&#039;ve got another reason to skip the first half.<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Though the main characters are awesome, there are way too many unimportant characters. Let&#039;s see the main characters first. Guy is a hot-blooded cyborg, HyoRyu is an ice transformer, EnRyu is fire, Volfogg is a ninja, and Mic Sounders the 13th uses SpongeBob&#039;s rock guitar attack from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Then there&#039;s the popular Soldat-J and the mechanoid King J-Der, with a lightsaber, finger cannons, and flaming bow and arrow.<br />
<br />
As for the unimportant characters, Mamoru&#039;s classmates are a big reason why GaoGaiGar isn&#039;t perfect. They get captured a lot (and do nothing about it) and <br />
contribute nothing at all (except Ikumi Kaidou, who becomes important after Pasder&#039;s defeat.) Without them, the first 25 episodes that drag on would be much shorter and their monsters would be defeated faster. Who wants a recurring damsel in distress for the sake of a recurring damsel in distress? (I&#039;m talking to you, Princess Peach.)

    The King of Braves. The Oath sworn through Courage. To many fans of Mecha anime, it is considered one of the greats, a proud milestone in the three decade evolution of giant robots stomping evil into paste.<br />
<br />
But how is it really? I&#039;ll do my best to step past my love of it, at least here if not in rating. Let&#039;s see how fair I can be.<br />
<br />
The story of GaoGarGar is good, well above average. While it does start as monster of the week fare, the second half of the show is almost universally applauded, and rightfully so. The backstories of several characters are interesting AND

        important while the overall narrative is solid. GaoGarGar suffers from from few direct plotholes, though some amazingly hard-to-swallow coincidences crop up.<br />
<br />
The art is fair: The human characters are styled in a more kid-show way than Anime &#039;average&#039; if you compare and other than some odd outfits, no one stands out. The robots and enemies, though, are lovingly detailed for their time and GaoGaiGar is one of the few combining Super Robots to have a perfect transformation. No parts need to mysteriously appear to form our hero! Acceptable, but hardly impressive animation, a penchant for stock footage and some painfully primative CGI round out the look of the program.<br />
<br />
The show may only be passable to the eye, but it is candy for the ears. From the ear-worm level &#039;Yuusha-oh, Tanjou!&#039; opening, to the shock chord that opens each episode, to that inspiring combination music, GaoGaiGar offers solidly enjoyable and well placed music. Not all of the songs are winners, but many of them are. Lather on a generally solid voice cast, including one of the premeir hot-blooded screamers of all of Anime as our hero, and this show clearly ranks in as Very Good here.<br />
<br />
Characterization is good, but ju~st barely. Everyone is an easily identified archtype and while they are GOOD at being that, none of them are shinning examples of whatever kind of character they are, nor do they reinvent the wheel. The only thing pushing this score up are the subtle touches: While our hero does not change, AT ALL, during the series, he IS more dynamic than most hot-blooded heroes right off the bat. Out of battle, Guy is calm, very friendly, and professional, rather than never being off like, say, Kamina or Domon from other, similar, anime. Our kid sidekick Mamoru undergoes some inconsistant but clear character growth, as do supporting characters Kaido and Soldato J.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the last category is purely subjective. In fairness, upfront, I will say this: If you like super robot anime, you are very likely to like GaoGaiGar. If not, there is just not enough here to change your mind. As for me? I ADORE this show. It is my favorite mecha Anime and the Gutsy Galaxy Guard are the sort of lunatics I&#039;d want defending my planet! Seeing all the new gadgets pop up and meeting more robots is enough to get me through the slow start of the show and I never tire of watching GaoGaiGar brutalize his opponents into high-veolocity shrapnel. Objectively, there are other mecha anime that are just, flat out, measurably BETTER than GaoGaiGar in nearly every way. So far, there are none I have enjoyed as much.<br />
<br />
Overall, I had to give this show an 8. It deserves a &#039;Very Good&#039; in my opinion and it does deserve it&#039;s place of respect. After Evangelion, the King of Braves gave his genre a much-needed return to screaming, courage, and over-the-topness that lead to Gurren Lagann, who is the unquestioned (as of this writeing) king of modern mecha shows. Kamina, Simon and the gang are everything GaoGaiGar was, done tighter, cleaner, bigger, better, and louder... but admiting that in no way diminishes the fact that from 1997 to 2007, giant robot awesomness was a golden squeaky hammer rather than a massive silver drill.
