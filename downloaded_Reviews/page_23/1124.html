    Singapore decided to show us anime fans some mercy by screening Road to Ninja, Houou no Miko and Tiger &amp; Bunny: The Beginning in the cinemas.<br />
<br />
Road to Ninja is a little different from the previous movies. While movies 1 to 5 introduce new characters—protagonists and antagonists—with plots that totally differ from the original story&#039;s, RtN is almost like a possible subplot of the main story.<br />
<br />
With the exception of some, we get the same characters we see in the main story, but with a strange twist that would greatly appeal to the audience. It’s like a dream come true to some fans. It also keeps your

          <span style="display: none;" id="review75499">
        mind going while you watch it, which personally, is what makes Naruto fun to watch. There’s also a hidden message in it, that is actually quite obvious in the starting of the movie.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a big chunk of flashback in one of the parts though, but it was from my favourite episode, so I&#039;m not complaining.<br />
<br />
Same art, new soundtracks, and overall it’s unique, funny and (kind of) tear-shedding, what I find—unbiasedly—worth skipping work for and the S$16.90 (large bottle of Coke with a free refill included) I spent on. I actually managed to get my non-Naruto-loving sister to watch it. And hey, more MinaKushi loving here!

    Have you ever seen a Naruto movie before? Yes? Good.<br />
Do you have the intention of watching this movie thinking it&#039;ll be something new? Yes? Alright, I want you to open a new tab and search up in Google, a montage of the &quot;Best scenes&quot; from this movie. Said montage will inevitably contain the much-talked about bath scene involving all the AU characters, a few scenes involving Naruto and his parents (perhaps Sakura if the person is a fan of that pairing), and his fight with the movie&#039;s big baddy (whom I won&#039;t spoil just in case, although if you don&#039;t know by now I doubt

          <span style="display: none;" id="review123323">
        you actually cared about this movie much).<br />
<br />
Do it, truly, come on. I&#039;ll be waiting.<br />
<br />
Done? Congratulations, you do not need to see this movie anymore.<br />
<br />
No, I am not kidding. You&#039;ve seen all this movie has to offer; You do not need to bother with it anymore.<br />
<br />
I am being as frank as I can be: This is what people for buying into it. No matter what they promise, it&#039;s always the same -- Their promise and promotion were bullshit, and ultimately it&#039;s another rasengan/shadow clone wank fest. It happened with the second movie when they promised us that Sasuke would be an integral part of it (He was barely there in the end), when they promised us that Minato would play a big role in the fourth movie (He was pointless to the story), it happened with the fifth movie (Or so I&#039;m told, I was not following this one so I am not completely certain what was the case here), and now it happened with this, and will probably happen to the 2014 movie too.<br />
<br />
Literally, the movie has no story; It&#039;s a holding pattern -- Naruto gets sad then something happens (he goes into the AU with Sakura), they faff about for like an hour, then the movie&#039;s bad guy pops in out of nowhere and with no explanation, ending with Naruto using a bunch of Rasengan and Shadow Clone and doing the whole &quot;believe in myself&quot; thing (Although, to it&#039;s credit, this one didn&#039;t end up with Naruto rasenganing the bad guy&#039;s ass, but rather with a fist fight, so there&#039;s that), even though said bad guy had previously nuked ENTIRE VILLAGES to ashes with a cough and the only reason he didn&#039;t vanish him out of existence with another nuke is because the movie didn&#039;t wanted him to.<br />
<br />
And, the biggest offender is that this wouldn&#039;t even be so bad if the movie wasn&#039;t so fucking AFRAID to go out of its comfort zone despite this being virtually an entire new canvas for work -- The much anticipated (and HEAVILY advertised) personality switches mean absolutely NOTHING to the story or plot and the explanations for them are entirely nonexistent, something that also wouldn&#039;t all too bad (it certainly wouldn&#039;t be good, but yeah), if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that they&#039;re literally only there for (Legitimately) FIVE MINUTES (ten, max); Naruto and Sakura get in the AU and immediately find Team 8 (Hinata, who now is mean and bitchy and one of the few characters with clothing switches, and Kiba and Shino who look the same and behave the same except instead being good with dogs and bugs, respectively, they&#039;re now bad with them), they runaway and find team 10 (Ino, who now is shy and soft spoken, and Chouji and Shikamaru who essentially switched personalities, Chouji now being fit and stoic and Shikamaru being hyper active and dumb, although not fat, funnily enough), then Sasuke (Whom, despite now being a &quot;playboy&quot;, is also basically the same outside of that, and this is literally pointed out by Naruto himself, plus a completely clothing switch), then that bath scene (No explanation is given for why they go there) where upon the last team shows up in medias res (Team Guy, compossing of Neji, who now is perverted and lacking in discipline, and Lee and Tenten who are the same except Tenten is now clumsy with weapons and Lee is a, well, I won&#039;t spoil just because the reveal of that makes for one of the better scenes in the movie), some faffing goes on before Hinata spots his cousin spying on the girls, causing her to get angry and attempt to beat him up until Lee shows up out of nowhere by falling through the ceiling (Much the same way he did in the manga preview, since the scene is essentially a reinacting of that with the personality switches), he runs away, they chase him ending in an actually pretty humorous scene, and then... They&#039;re gone. Literally. They just disappear, completely. They&#039;re not mentioned or seen ever again, with two exceptions: Shino, for no reason other than to show off his new found disdain for bugs (Him also being the second character to show no signs of change in the previous scene), and Sasuke who shows up two more times, one to give Sakura a flower (Which was in the trailer) and another where upon he flirts with some more girls causing Sakura to realize she&#039;s not a special case to him and making her sad.<br />
<br />
The rest is entirely going through the motions; Sad scenes with Naruto&#039;s parents (some of which are, admittedly, fairly poignant), who are also exactly the same with the exception of one trait that I won&#039;t spoil, a bunch of pretty damn useless fights and missions, and then the ultimate bad guy shows up, destroying the village and ending in a long fight with Naruto, before he goes back to his world because he doesn&#039;t want to be there anymore.<br />
<br />
And, I&#039;m saying all of this with a pain, because this movie was one of thing that sparkled back my interest with the Naruto fandom (Where upon I got a lot of friends that I&#039;m quite grateful for, even though I don&#039;t quite follow the series anymore those people keep me tangled back to it), and I really did wanted it to be good; I love its concept, I truly loved AU Hinata and the bad guy especially, and for the most part, while the animation is nothing outstanding, it&#039;s nice and pretty, a good treat for the eyes, ESPECIALLY on high resolution. But concept can never make up for lacking execution, and what the execution gave us was a reskinning of an already done movie with a more than questionable marketing campaign. Also, contrary to popular belief, the creator of the series, Kishimoto, didn&#039;t actually write this whole movie, he just designed the alternative characters and a few touches on the script and plot line, for the most part this was done entirely by the same thing that has brought us the same movies from before and that &quot;Gold mine&quot; of filler which makes the anime such a classic.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, this does make it a little less sad considering that if it really was written and done by him and this is all he could do then it would tell you just how much wasted potential this series has had to suffer.<br />
<br />
Still, all in all, what we have here is nothing more than a reskinned retread. There&#039;s nothing wrong with retreads, many forms of art have been essentially retreads of old formulas in order to explore new ideas, and, to a small (Literally microscopic) degree, this does explore new ideas. But at the end, we&#039;re still watching the same shit we&#039;ve already seen with some added scenes of silly &quot;what ifs&quot; that amount to little more than &quot;what could&#039;ve been&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t believe in scores, but I have to rate this, so I&#039;ll just go with 5 because it&#039;s in the middle.

    *Please note that there will be some spoilers in this review*<br />
<br />
If you could have one wish, any wish, would you give up everything just to see it fulfilled? <br />
<br />
Once upon a time, I loved Naruto; I would sit down in front of a TV every week and wait for it to come on just so that I could see what happened next. As time progressed, my love for it whittled down to something that I watched merely to get it out of the way. That was my mindset coming in to watch this movie- it was to just get it out of the way. What

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96577">
        I experienced, however, exceeded my expectations to become what I see as the best Naruto movie ever made. Now, enough of this sappy monologue, let’s get into the actual review.<br />
<br />
First things first: like most of the Naruto movies, Road to Ninja is, for all intents and purposes, non-canon. So, instead of complaining about how it’s non-canon, I’m actually going to review the story and the themes it tackles. The basic premise revolves around Sakura and Naruto being transported to an alternate world by Madara’s “prototype” Tsukuyomi where most stuff is basically the same but there are slight changes, or “ripples” like Madara calls them. While most of them are just personality and clothing changes, the biggest difference is Sakura’s familial situation is switched with Naruto’s. Yup, you read that right; Minato and Kushina are alive and well in this alternate world but Sakura’s parents no longer exist. One of the biggest themes in Naruto is the loneliness and despair of not having anyone to come home to or care about you, namely parents, and this movie tackles this theme head-on as well as the theme of accepting what is false so long as it brings you happiness successfully; these provided a much-needed emotional factor that I believe really makes the movie shine. However, make no mistake, there are flaws in the story such as characters appearing seemingly just for the sake of appearing, some plot holes, and what I found to be a lackluster “final” battle (I use quotes because it’s not really the real final battle). It is advised that you watch episode 311 of Shippuuden before you watch the movie but it isn’t absolutely necessary because all that you would miss would be certain inside jokes but I found the comedy in Road to Ninja to be pretty good, even without them.<br />
<br />
As expected, the art in Road to Ninja is a step above the normal fare found in the TV series but is nothing ground-breaking or spectacular. Everything looks good, some parts more so than others, and the colors are more vibrant but, I did happen to notice the typical derp faces every once in a while or pupils not being perfectly aligned, minor things like that. As far as the animation goes, everything seemed to flow smoothly and very nicely, nothing much to complain about here. The sound design as well is what you would normally expect from the series with an overall great-sounding soundtrack. One aspect I noticed was the voice-acting was handled very well, especially given the fact that personalities were completely different in the alternate world; being able to adapt like that shows a professionalism and talent which even I, as a member of the audience, can appreciate.<br />
<br />
Lastly are the characters, and since most of the cast have switched personalities, this is somewhat difficult to accurately grade the cast if you look at every single character. Let’s look at the Ino-Shika-Cho combo as an example, Choji is skinny and hates eating a lot, Ino is mild-tempered and sweet, and Shikamaru is a complete idiot. Explanation as to why any of the characters with changed personalities are the way they are is completely nonexistent but, to me, that makes complete sense in context. Naruto and Sakura were transported to a different world where they are viewed as acting “weird” because they do not conform to how their counterparts within that society would have normally acted. So, instead of focusing on the “new” characters, I’ll focus on Naruto and Sakura because we can accurately judge how they have changed throughout their experience in that world. Both Naruto and Sakura experience development through realizing what life would be like if their familial situations were reversed and ultimately seem to have changed from their experiences by the end of the movie, though I somewhat doubt this will reflected in the actual TV series. While I would have liked to see more of the alternate cast and explored the different alternate world a bit more, it was inevitable that shortcuts be taken due to the limited amount of time they spent in the alternate world. The only other thing I have a gripe with is that Naruto actually seemed a bit underpowered but that is fairly minor.<br />
<br />
TL;DR? Well, despite certain plot holes, characters seemingly appearing solely for the sake of appearing, and a somewhat lackluster “final” battle, I particularly enjoyed what the movie had to offer. Road to Ninja’s art, animation, and sound are what you would normally expect from Naruto so, if you don’t like that, you probably won’t like this movie. However, unless you are basically a Naruto scholar and/or expect everything to be perfect and make sense, you will probably enjoy what this movie has to offer as I did.<br />
<br />

    SPOILERS<br />
 <br />
This is basically a rant <br />
<br />
This movie was horrible. Shitty pacing,timeline doesnt make sense,bad use of characters and I cant emphasize this much. I mean they bring characters like Sasuke back and he does absolutely nothing. They did the alternate  rookies even worse as they were hyped so much in the trailers as if they were going to be important but they were good only for a hot tub scene(Neji spying on hinata in a hot tub - weird) and thats it. <br />
<br />
This highlight of this movie was to be the relationship between naruto and his parent but even that was depicted poorly.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review121119">
        I do not get how they did not know their son had become evil and was capturing tail beast and killing people when they went on a mission.How long was this mission? How did the village not know this? Shouldnt they have captured naruto when he came back? <br />
<br />
This movie had only one good part in it and thats when menma uses the great spiraling ring on the village. That was awesome then it started sucking again. Everyone was reduced to fodder level ninja. Minato, Kakashi, Gai, Kushina was taken out easily. <br />
<br />
Akatsuki shows up again in this movie as mercenaries which is cool also but not that great. The final battle was just awful. It was alright till they both transformed into foxes and started spamming bijuu bombs and clawing each other. The movie finishes with tobi fusing with menma and nauruto throwing a kunai whcih passes through him but somehow destroys the orb that is conveniently in the eye that was struck.<br />
<br />
This movie had so much potential due to the setting but the managed to ruin it and kishi did not help with all them flashbacks.<br />

    Well I am gonna make it short. <br />
This was the only (and maybe also the last) film from Naruto world worth watching. Finally no random princess saving, no bunch of new characters and the most important thing, finally a good story with some deep thoughts. Yea no wonder, it is said that Kishimoto personally worked on this one.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this movie. There was something for everyone. I laughed many times when I saw really weird behavior of some characters we all know very well. Haha in this film, everything is slightly different. There are also cool fights and animation is really good. Not the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95067">
        best anime fights I have seen though but still quite decent. You also have a chance to see some characters you meet just rarely in anime like Naruto&#039;s parents or Sakura&#039;s parents etc. <br />
<br />
The most valuable thing in every anime for me are some deep thoughts you can think about. You know like some spiritual legacy ^_^. Finally I found something like that in Naruto film! The storyline is not very complex but there is very nice situation. [A bit of spoilers!] New world with fulfilled dreams. Everything seems fantastic, but it is real? Does it even matter whether it is real or not? Is it important to fight for the truth or shall we just stay in the illusion where we have everything we need?<br />
<br />
So the result. Every Naruto fan should in my opinion watch this. To hell with other Naruto films. Honestly they are all trash. This one is the only Naruto film I accept. And it is good one. Somehow reminded me the good anime films with some hidden meanings and you know like Mononoke Hime, Spirited Away etc. (Of course I cannot compare this one to them but the style reminded me them. Like that it is not only another filler but valuable piece of animation.)<br />
<br />
“Somebody once asked me what a ninja is. My sensei told me that ninja is the one that endures.”<br />
<br />
BTW Nice soundtrack. ^^

Hearing about how this movie was supposed to be one of the better (if not the best) Naruto movies because of its interesting plot and nice twist at the end, I decided to give this movie a shot even though it&#039;s been a very long time since I&#039;ve watched any sort of Naruto animation (been sticking to reading to the manga). <br />
<br />
Overall, I was entertained by the movie and enjoyed the divergence from the typical Naruto movie formula, at least in the movies I&#039;ve seen so far (Naruto meets new character X, learns

          <span style="display: none;" id="review154385">
        a lot about X, grows closer to X, and eventually Naruto + crew + X team up together to beat new villain Y who is extraordinarily evil with no redeeming qualities). That&#039;s not to say that the plot is anything groundbreaking as the idea of a character slipping into an alternate world is something that&#039;s certainly been explored in movies like the newest Gintama movie and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Nevertheless, the characterization of Naruto and Sakura in this movie is a breath of fresh air and it&#039;s nice to see these characters being explored more thoroughly instead of the movie original characters that all seem to have the same tragic past. There are certainly well done scenes/moments in this movie where Naruto and Sakura feel very human and relatable which I believe is where the movie shines the most. It does not quite make up for the numerous plot holes, the horrid pacing at some points, blatant use of TV footage, and awkward characterization(yes, the characterization is also a con), but it does make the movie more watchable. With a movie that is good but not great in most of the categories (art/sound/plot), characters go a long way to making this movie something that you won&#039;t quit halfway on. I would say this movie is something you can definitely watch whenever you&#039;re bored or have a lot of free time. Just don&#039;t expect to be blown away.<br />
<br />
***IN DEPTH REVIEW BUT WITH SPOILERS***<br />
<br />
Art - 7/10<br />
Art and animation in this movie was about what you would expect: fairly good(it&#039;s a movie after all) but nothing too crazy. There were a few shots of the city that I thought were nice and particularly detailed, and some of the fighting animation was pretty good. Other than that, I would say everything else was simply satisfactory.<br />
<br />
Sound - 7/10<br />
Once again, all the sounds were fairly good. There were a few emotional/battle tracks I enjoyed but I would not say they were on my &quot;man i gotta look this up on youtube&quot; level. Even the theme song by AKFG was probably not one of their better songs. Overall, the background music felt appropriate. <br />
<br />
Story/Character - 7/10<br />
With all the praise for the creativity with the plot and the characterization I gave the movie above, I had numerous gripes with the plot/characterization. Maybe I missed an explanation somewhere but for the most part, these things stood out in my mind while I was watching the movie:<br />
1) Other than for plot convenience, why would Konoha only send out Naruto and his friends to fight the Akatsuki if they had revived/regrouped. And what was the explanation for this battle anyway? Were they an illusion? What was the point of the severed hand? <br />
2) Why is Iruka such a dick in the beginning of the movie? He should know what Naruto is going through. He seemed very out of character during the scene at Ichiraku ramen. What happened to first episode Iruka?<br />
(Small issue :The memna part was a good way to introduce the story behind/poke fun at Naruto&#039;s new name in the alternate world but the ramen cook should not just be adding random ingredients to people&#039;s orders without telling them man.)<br />
3) You&#039;re telling me Madara managed to teleport straight into Konoha  and that he decided that best way to capture the Nine-Tails was to throw Naruto (and Sakura too, you know, for the lulz) into an alternate dimension so that Naruto could POSSIBLY tire himself out while fighting his alternate self. And what was up with him getting defeated by the same move. I know it&#039;s a nice nod to Naruto becoming more like his father but man... Madara why you such a scrub?<br />
4) Naruto getting angry at his parents when he first sees them also felt weird. I get that he feels that they&#039;re impostors at first, but I don&#039;t know if anger is how someone would normally react in that situation. Then again I&#039;ve never been an orphan who slipped into an alternate dimension where his parents were alive so what do I know. This is something they could have corrected with more insight into Naruto&#039;s thoughts.<br />
5) That one scene where Naruto and Sakura meet up to talk but for some reason decide that they don&#039;t want to see each other face to face. And the awkward walk away?<br />
6) Honestly that Rasen-nuke was kind of unnecessary. And would a Rasengan really be able to do that much damage in the first place?<br />
7) Naruto saying unnecessary things to his alternate dimension parents who have no idea WTF is going on just so Naruto can look cool. Check. I guess they did come and save him at the end so this works out. <br />
8) Man that one scene with TV footage that just dragged on and on. <br />
9) Why didn&#039;t Madara just make Sakura lose her memories while they were fighting. <br />
10) So what was the deal with evil alternate Naruto? When did he change to the masked villain? Why did he change back? I mean I thought Madara said he couldn&#039;t interfere with the world even though he was the creator.<br />
<br />
Overall though, the plot/characterization though was fine. I liked how they opened with the idea that &quot;a ninja is one who endures&quot; and closed with that idea as Naruto walked back home alone after watching Sakura reunite with her family only to suprise us with the non-dick version of Iruka. I liked how the spiral of the scroll reminded Naruto of the Rasengan after he loses his memories. It was a nice small twist on its own. I liked all the incarnations of the alternate world and wished I could have seen more of them. As I mentioned above, I particularly enjoyed the focus on Naruto and Sakura as well (this movie was first time I ever saw Sakura&#039;s parents to begin with. Sakura&#039;s dad seems pretty awesome too). <br />
Their parts in this movie made the movie.

    2012 Film overseen by Masashi Kishimoto<br />
Directed by Hayato Date<br />
6th Shippuuden Movie &amp; 9th Naruto movie overall.<br />
Review from my POV (w/personal biases)<br />
(Sp)oiler Lite.<br />
<br />
PROS/What I Liked about the Film:<br />
+ On paper, this seemed to me like a very appealing premise. Main villain constructs new technique to use on Naruto, where he (and Sakura) are put in what essentially is Topsy-Turvy Town/OppositeVille/A &quot;reversed&quot; Konoha so to speak. like a badass &quot;what if?&quot; episode<br />
+ Speaking of reversed everything, I personally thought that some of the humor worked well for some characters (Sp) Energetic Kakashi and &quot;old man&quot; Guy,&quot; Don Draper&quot; Sasuke and &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot; Rock Lee, etc.<br />
+ 1

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96443">
        or 2 aesthetically appealing action scenes, particularly in the climax.<br />
<br />
CONS/What I didn&#039;t like:<br />
- The &quot;reversed&quot; effect is treated as a gimmick. Superficial at best.<br />
- Other supporting characters didn&#039;t bode so well with me (Sp) Hinata is excessively aggressive for no apparent reason. Some of the &quot;cool&quot; characters are turned into dweebs.<br />
- For a movie, it feels like a bottle episode. There&#039;s only 3 set pieces.<br />
- The theme of &quot;Family&quot; feels more forced than natural<br />
- (Sp) (personal) &quot;Menma&quot;? WTF is this, AnoHana? Cmon man, use a better name.<br />
<br />
Final Note:<br />
Although it had a good concept,  it was executed poorly. Ultimately, this feels like above average filler with a budget.<br />
<br />
Recommends to:<br />
Those who like the Bizzaro world concept<br />
Fans of Naruto.

     First of all I’ll try to retain myself from spoiling but I don’t promise that I wont.<br />
WATCH THIS AFTER EPISODE 311, sorry for the caps, but seriously watch this movie after episode 311. It will be so much more fun.<br />
<br />
I recommend this movie for everyone who got bored of fillers. It will make an amazing feeling that you are not repetitively  stopped from seeing action by fillers. I loved the way the plot was made,  the wishes of Naruto and Sakura, the other world and the way it ended proving my ideas of how it will end considering the first hour of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96419">
        the movie.<br />
It was extremely well drawn and animated, maybe even better than the other episodes. <br />
There are a lot of personalities you maybe wished to see, and a lot of fun in the first part and the second part has enough fights to let you see Naruto with nice moves. <br />
Overall: well made, I loved the story and the way it was made, didn&#039;t want to spoil this review so it&#039;s not much to say. Thanks for reading.<br />
<br />
Well I guess I kept my promise of not spoiling it. As for a few spoiler words: best looking &quot;Naruto&quot; in the ending, something similar to Ichigo in episode ~309. Guess that’s it, thanks for reading.<br />
(I have a spoiled review/re-cap/my thoughts of the movie in the discussions page 3, ao_no_exo)

    sorry but as a fan of naruto, ill just give a 10 to every single thing for this movie.<br />
i&#039;ve watched naruto for years but i got bored after all members of akatsuki died.<br />
but this movie really bring back memories to me, the day i started to watch naruto<br />
well back to the topic<br />
the story is really unexpected and is totally different with other naruto movies, i didn&#039;t like some of the naruto movies because the story is always repeating. so ill give the story a 10<br />
for the sound, great timing for the bgm and the ending song is really nice <br />
<br />
as for the character, its really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99115">
        funny at the beginning especially hinata HAHA<br />
and kushina!!!!<br />
<br />
for enjoyment, as you can see i really enjoyed it since im writing this review -.-<br />
<br />
overall, how can i not give it a 10??? i was born for this movie hahaha, this movie really gave me the feeling to endure and move on like a ninja. i kept on ask myself if i can leave my family in the same situation<br />
<br />
sorry if this review did not help you since it&#039;s my first time writing a review.<br />
to end this review ill have to say &quot;A ninja is one who ENDURES!!!&quot;<br />

    WARNING: SOME SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Okay, this was about as good as I expected, but I was still a little disappointed.<br />
<br />
It was cool to see alternate versions of people, I won&#039;t deny that. I do wanna say though, that they get about 5-10 minutes of screen time. I don&#039;t mind that too much.<br />
<br />
Naruto and his parents meeting was about what I expected too. Very emotional, I liked that a lot. Probably my favorite part of the movie.<br />
<br />
Then, you get to the action. It didn&#039;t seem forced, just, it felt like Kishimoto wrote everything except the fight scenes. Naruto actually said &quot;There&#039;s too many of them!&quot; at one point.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review96333">
        He seemingly forgot that he could use Kage Bunshin. Actually, Naruto almost seemed nerfed.<br />
<br />
This clearly takes place after Naruto gained the Tailed Beast Mode and met his mother. Yet, he never used Tailed Beast Mode. In the manga, he spams it like he does Rasengan and Kage Bunshin. Here, he only contemplates using it for a second.<br />
<br />
The last fight seemed more like a slugging match, with the Kyuubi as fists. Not very much worth mentioning, just Kyuubi fighting Kyuubi, lots of claws and lasers and pretty lights.<br />
<br />
The Akatsuki do show up, but it&#039;s painfully obvious that the only reason they show up at all is for &quot;Wow! Akatsuki fighting as good guys! Awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
I also wanted to see what everyone in the alternate world would think about how strong Naruto is, but we never get to see their reactions to that.<br />
<br />
The time frame is AU, it doesn&#039;t fit anywhere in canon. After the Fourth World War, since Konoha isn&#039;t in the battlefield, yet they still call Tobi &#039;Madara.&#039;<br />
<br />
I guess my biggest complaint in the end, is that Naruto doesn&#039;t fight like Naruto, and we never get much interaction between the alternate characters and Naruto/Sakura.<br />
<br />
In conclusion:<br />
<br />
Story: 9/10 - Not bad. Points off because of the obvious AU time frame, which annoyed me a bit, but overall not too bad. Some interesting tidbits like Sakura&#039;s parents and Minato and Kushina.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 - It&#039;s Naruto. The fight scenes are well animated, but there are some drops in less important scenes, and it&#039;s nothing particularly special.<br />
<br />
Sound: 7/10 - The vocal songs were average, and the OST was just kinda what you would expect. Again, nothing particularly special.<br />
<br />
Character: 6/10 - My biggest complaint. Naruto not fighting like Naruto, not too much character interaction with the alternate world, so not much development there.<br />
<br />
Maybe you would put the emotional parts, like reuniting with the parents here, but I chose to put that in with the story, and focus this score on individual characters.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 7/10 - I was screaming at my screen for Naruto to use Kage Bunshin, to use some new overpowered Rasengan, to use Tailed Beast Mode, Sage Mode, to do something besides hit the guy in the face. It was not to be really. I did like the emotional parts though, like meeting Minato and Kushina, and Sakura&#039;s despair at her parents being dead.<br />
<br />
Overall: 7/10 - Better than the rest, but still just good, not &#039;great.&#039;<br />

    Before I start this review let me just say, that I stopped caring about this franchise YEARS AGO. Still, the premise of this movie really caught my eye. So I recommend this film to any former fans of the Naruto series like myself.<br />
<br />
The selling point of Road to Ninja is that it takes pace in an alternate setting. All the characters have different personalities, Sasuke&#039;s still in the village,and Naruto&#039;s parents are still alive. In other words, it&#039;s the ULTIMATE FAN-FICTION. Where everything you disliked or complained about the series is reset.<br />
<br />
However, it suffers from the same problems you&#039;ll find in any of the other

          <span style="display: none;" id="review92163">
        NARUTO media. For example, the writing has some wholes in it. In the movie, Sakura&#039;s parents are the heroes of the village but we are not informed on what they did. Also the alternate Naruto somehow became an antagonist but that&#039;s not thoroughly explained. The viewers are just expected to go with &quot;it&#039;s a parallel universe&quot; and not question anything.<br />
<br />
On another note, the art and animation do not match the usual film budget quality. Except for a few scenes it&#039;s seems no different than the TV version. As for the sound Yasuharu Takanashi&#039;s score is as effective as ever and fan favorite band Asian Kung Fu Generation provides another rocking theme song.<br />
<br />
Despite some of it&#039;s flaws Road to Ninja, if anything is enjoyable. No one should really expect much after years of shonen movie expansions. It&#039;s got satisfying fight scenes,pretty good humor, and even some wholesome moments for the characters.  Respect it or not, it&#039;s something that can be remembered with fondness off not forgotten right away. The movie does its job of entertaining it&#039;s fans so there&#039;s no wondering on why  it&#039;s so successful. Road to Ninja is a simple story with nothing thought provoking or outstanding about it. But you know what? That&#039;s just fine.<br />
<br />
P.S. Naruto&#039;s friends don&#039;t get much screen time so you may be disappointed if you were looking forward to Flirting Sasuke and Badass Hinata. The Akatsuki are good guys so that might make up for it.

    Oh my. This movie. Before I continue with review, I want to point out that this review may CONTAIN SPOILERS and is solely my own opinion. It might seems biased because I love Naruto in general but I just want others to know how much this movie impacted me. <br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
Naruto and his comrades fought the Akatsuki members even the ones they have killed before, abruptly, all the members disappeared not long after the fight, leaving Naruto and his comrades in confusion. They went back to the village and every single one of his comrades bragged about their achievement kicking out the akatsuki out of the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review170739">
        village to their parents, asking their parents to promote them to a higher ninja level, jounin. Being an orphan, Naruto had no one to talk to as he stood and look around with a sad face. He then met Iruka Sensei and went to Ichiraku Ramen. Naruto confessed to Iruka, saying that he wanted Iruka to promote him to a Jounin. Iruka denied because he had to be a Chuunin first. Since Naruto didn&#039;t take his Chuunin exam, he wasn&#039;t allowed to be ranked higher. This made Naruto unsatisfied and they seemed to have a serious quarrel. Knowing that it was useless, he walked out of the shop. He accidentally met Sakura who was in a hurry and both of them went to the park. At the park, Sakura started complaining about her parents being whiny and bossy especially her mom and Naruto wasn&#039;t satisfied to hear it. A while later, a man who called himself Madara appeared and sent them to a parallel universe to test out his Project Tsuku yo Mi. Not knowing that they have been sent to the other realm, they were shocked to find out that none of their comrade knew who Madara was. Not only that, their friends&#039; personalities also changed. To their surprised, in the other realm, Sakura was the one who lost her parents as they lost their lives saving the village (like Naruto&#039;s parents did), while Naruto, on the other hand, lived by a different name, Menma, and his parents were alive and well. In the beginning, Sakura seemed to enjoy her life as an orphan in the other dimension while Naruto had a mixed feeling about his parents. The story went on to Naruto and Sakura encountering Madara to be able to return to the real world. In the end, they succeeded and went back home. What seemed to be a few days in the parallel world, was only probably a few minutes, or hours in the real world. <br />
<br />
-Character- <br />
SAKURA<br />
If you watch this movie and do not feel even slightly annoyed by Sakura, you deserve unlimited supplies of ramen. In my opinion, Sakura&#039;s character in the first half of the movie is unbearable. This started when Sakura and Naruto went to the park and Sakura started complaining about her parents. &#039;why cant I have normal parents like everybody else&#039;. Naruto listened at first but he felt a bit upset with her because she wasn&#039;t thinking of Naruto&#039;s feelings. Then, Sakura had the nerve to say &#039;why does it has to be you in front of me, Sasuke would&#039;ve understand me better&#039;. Perhaps she was too overwhelmed by the feelings of having annoying parents that she forgot Naruto was always there for her and saved her from every mess she was into. This makes me stopped watching for at least 15 minutes, taking my time to ease my mind. After she went to the parallel universe and started to realize how lonely Naruto was in the real world and how solitary she was in the other realm, her character seemed to become more mature and understandable. This continue until they managed to get home, finally being able to see her parents again and feeling grateful what she already had. <br />
<br />
NARUTO&#039;s character is painful too watch as well, not because his character was unbearable, but mostly because of the feels trip you&#039;re going to have due to his solitary. This started when they managed to fought back the Akatsuki and had no one to talk to, since he was an orphan while every single one of his comrades bragged about their achievements to their parents. The same thing happened when he was in the park with Sakura before they encountered Madara, as I already stated, an orphan boy had to listen to his friends complaining about having annoying and bossy parents. In the parallel universe, his character slightly changed especially when he found out that his parents were alive and well. He didn&#039;t want to be close to them, didn&#039;t want to get along with them. Mostly because he knew that they were not real, that it was all a painful lie. But even if he tried to deny his feelings, deep down inside his heart, he had always wanted this life, a perfect happy live with both of his parents, a life which he never had a chance to live in. He wanted to avoid the feeling of being home, because sooner or later, that feeling will be taken away from him. After battling with what he wanted and what he knew, he decided to be apart of the family and used the name Menma, and for that short while, he was happy. As much as he wanted his life to stay that way, he had to get back to reality. After he went back to the Hidden Village, he started to feel lonely again, Sakura had people to come back to, her parents, while Naruto on the other hand, had no one waiting for him at home, just like other times. To his surprised, Iruka sensei was already there waiting for him in his house, with food on the table, to celebrate his birthday together. As tears rolled down his cheek, that was when Naruto realized, even if he had no parents to go back home to, he will always be in his comrades&#039; heart, a place where he truly belongs. <br />
<br />
MINATO AND KUSHINA&#039;s personalities didn&#039;t change in the parallel universe as well, at least that&#039;s what Naruto thought.. Minato was still that sweet and gentle guy while Kushina was the same hot tempered red haired woman. Naruto didn&#039;t realize how much they differ from his real parents until their fight with Madara. When Naruto wanted to save Sakura, Minato didn&#039;t oblige, saying that Sakura was a stranger and they didn&#039;t want to risk their lives saving a stranger, they also forbid Naruto to save her as well. That&#039;s when he had a clear idea that somehow, they&#039;re still not real. Naruto didn&#039;t know much about his parents but one thing he always knew was that Minato was the hero of Hidden Villages, and in order to do that, he was ready to seal himself even though that means he will not be able to see Naruto grow up. That was the kind of father he had and in that moment, he knew he was doing the right thing to go back to the real world.<br />

OTHER CHARACTERS. (not everyone) <br />
In the parallel world, their friends had different personalities.<br />
HINATA- she became a very confident woman and feared no one, pretty scary too, especially when she threated Sakura not to get close to Menma, completely a contrast to her real personality<br />
SHINO- hated bugs <br />
KIBA- became a cat person instead<br />
AKAMARU- never got along with Kiba and bit him all the time<br />
CHOUJI- had Shikamaru&#039;s personality<br />
SHIKAMARU- Chouji and Naruto&#039;s personalities mixed, love to eat, very goofy<br />
INO- a nerd<br />
NEJI- a pervert, especially to Hinata<br />
SASUKE- a player who flirted with girls<br />
KAKASHI and GUY- switched personalities with each other <br />
TSUNADE and SHIZUNE- switched boobs instead (insert laughing emoji)<br />
<br />
Watching this movie late at night is definitely not a good idea, the tears keep coming and i ended up woke up with swollen eyes. Definitely makes me appreciate what I have. This movie deserves more ratings and recognitions. Parallel universe is not a very original movie plot but it brings justice to this motion pictures. The story is outstanding, definitely a lot of unexpected plot twists, funny and enjoyable, but also make you go through the emotional feels trip the entire movie. <br />

    Naruto Movie 6: Road to Ninja follows the journey of Naruto and Sakura to an alternate world created by the diabolical Madara a.k.a. Tobi. Naruto and Sakura are shocked to learn that this world is a complete opposite of their own. The two will have to find out a way to get back to their world in one piece. It should be noted that like most movies and ova&#039;s this doesn&#039;t follow the original story completely. Although there wasn&#039;t all that much action in between, there was surely enough comedy and emotion.

I watched this in Korean dub (English subbed) and the first thing I recommend is that you watch this movie in the same dub you usually watch Naruto with. Whilst the Korean VAs did a fantastic job - especially Kushina&#039;s VA, she was amazing - the movie will have more meaning for you if you watch it in the same dub you use to watch Shippuden.<br />
<br />
The second thing I recommend is that you have a pretty decent understanding of the Naruto series before you watch this movie. If you&#039;re new to Naruto,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review93925">
        you might want to put this movie on hold for a while, as you won&#039;t have a clue what&#039;s going on unless you&#039;ve seen a good amount of Naruto: Shippuden. (By good amount I mean a couple hundred episodes...)<br />
<br />
One thing that many fans were excited about regards the release of this movie was the insight into the certain desires of the characters, and many thought that pairings would be prevalent. However there is very little by way of that, nothing more than the teasers released before the movie came out.<br />
<br />
The things I liked - the animation was FABULOUS, the producers really put a lot of effort into this one, especially with some of the battle scenes. There was also some new OST I hadn&#039;t heard before, which really captured the moments well. The movie made me both laugh and cry - Kiba&#039;s neko-chan moments and Lee&#039;s... well, I&#039;ll let you find out... and the emotional scenes between Naruto and his parents.<br />
<br />
The movie gives you a whole new outlook on how things could have been. Roles are reversed, personalities go to polar opposites, and unimaginable changes take place. If you&#039;re a fan of Naruto, I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ll enjoy it.<br />
<br />

Story: 7 (Good)<br />

    Before tonight, I had planned to write a review for each Naruto movie in sequential order since I just binge watched all the Shippuden movies for the first time. However, after watching the sixth film, Road to Ninja, I immediately had to write this review. Otherwise, my thoughts on the movie might escape me, as it left me speechless. A movie like this only comes around every once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
Naruto Shippuden The Movie 6: Road to Ninja(Alt. Naruto The Movie 9: Road to Ninja) is the sixth film in the Naruto Shippuden series, and the ninth film overall in the greater Naruto franchise.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review162829">
        Having been placed timeline wise in the latter half of the Shippuden series, Naruto has grown as a ninja and many of the questions he once had have been answered. Because of this, this movie is filled with story spoilers for anyone who has not been keeping up with the series. This is not a good jumping on point for new fans or anyone who doesn&#039;t like spoilers. <br />
<br />
However, for those loyal Naruto fans who have kept with the series thus far, this movie is a special treat that should not be overlooked. The story answers what very well may be one of the Naruto fandoms greatest questions. The story alone is a masterpiece all on its own. The art is astoundingly good and deserves to be viewed in high definition. Likewise, the soundtrack is equally beautiful with many tracks that will make you want to listen over and over again. Yasuharu Takanashi proves once again that his brand of music fits the Narutoverse like a glove. The sound effects are also good, though I still can&#039;t get used to the muffled Shadow Clone sound.<br />

The main characters of this film are Naruto and Sakura and as such they receive massive amounts of character development. Well, as far as movie canon is concerned. Since most Naruto movies, possibly including this one, are considered non-canon, their character development doesn&#039;t transfer over to the series. However, for this movie alone, these two characters develop greatly. We see sides of them that you could scarcely imagine. And the way that the story goes about this is just beautiful. A stark contrast like night and day. Aside from those two, all of the usual Naruto characters personalities are reversed, and it&#039;s interesting to see what everyone is like. I had quite a few good laughs at just the dialogue alone. <br />
<br />
Before this movie, my favorite Naruto film was Naruto Shippuden The Movie 2: Bonds, and Legend of the Stone of Gelel before that. Road to Ninja surpasses both of those movies, and the rest. It reminded me of why I love Naruto. When you look past the filler and some of the bland or awful characters, you see this deep and rich story that when left by itself is just plain beautiful. And that is why I keep coming back to this series. And this film greatly emphasized those aspects that I love.<br />
<br />
It saddens me to think that the manga will soon be over, and that The Last - Naruto The Movie will soon be upon us, bringing a close to this epic journey that many of us have followed since the very beginning. And while I have no idea how long Naruto&#039;s legacy will last following its conclusion, I do know that I will never forget it. And if you&#039;re a die hard Naruto fan like me, then Road to Ninja is a movie you can&#039;t afford to skip for any possible reason.

    They did it. They finally fucking did it. This is a real, actual movie with real, actual stakes for the characters and without a fucking escort mission. It&#039;s not even half bad!<br />
<br />
The theme they picked (Yes! A real, actual theme!) was the dangers of taking our relationships for granted. I don&#039;t relate to it super well, because my parents were awful, but I liked the direction for Naruto. The scenes with his folks were excellent. The bits they allowed Sakura to have with her parents were nice, too.<br />
<br />
Sakura gets the short end of the stick, as expected. Despite participating in the isekai plot as much

          <span style="display: none;" id="review366383">
        as Naruto, it felt like she had far fewer scenes. That was a shame because it didn&#039;t have her engage much with the loneliness without her parents that we would expect to see. But it was there. I would have preferred that she actively confront the mirror world&#039;s Sasuke over his womanizing, but that would be a dangerous sort of scene that I wouldn&#039;t necessarily trust the Naruto team to pull off well without being misogynistic. I mean, the scene at the beginning, after the movie had established that Naruto would be extra emo about his dead parents for the duration of this, where Sakura said &quot;sometimes I wish I didn&#039;t have parents.&quot; It read to me like they thought Sakura was a thoughtless person, especially when she escalated it to &quot;Why are you even here? If Sasuke was here...&quot; Because. Like. Damn. I was laughing for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
The movie&#039;s shortcomings are that it sidelined most of the cast to focus on Naruto, even if it did so better than any of the other movies by being an isekai. It could be argued that the scenes we got with the rest of the cast were &quot;enough&quot; to play out the mirror world joke. I would have still preferred that they be the ones to come to Naruto and Sakura&#039;s aid rather than the series&#039; villains. But having the villains turn up as good guys in the mirror world was valid, too.<br />
<br />
I also wasn&#039;t a fan of forcing the climax of the movie to escalate so far afield of the theme. It was an excuse to have two tailed-beast hosts fight to the death, and it was unnecessary. The fight itself was fine, but I didn&#039;t think it meant anything. If anything, they should have had the final conflict be between Naruto and his parents—not necessarily a fight—so it would be an extension of his arc about learning to accept their love.<br />
<br />
The inciting incident, where the Leaf Village characters&#039; parents all write letters of recommendation to promote their children to jonin was perfunctory and weird, unnecessary nepotism that made no sense. But the movie got rid of that plot in less than a second because it was just an excuse anyway. Fair dinkum.<br />
<br />
In 2012, they finally decided that a Naruto movie didn&#039;t have to be just an excuse plot. My expectations for the rest of the series has been suitably raised, and that rules.

    Content (plot/characters):<br />
The story was conceived by Kishimoto himself so I thought it was definitely worth watching. The story takes place in a &quot;genjutsu world&quot; and it&#039;s kinda like your typical AU. The personalities of the characters are different in this world and so happen to be this world&#039;s Naruto and Sakura&#039;s family backgrounds. I personally find the plot to be not too interesting but, like everyone else, I enjoyed the scenes with the AU characters and that tiny glimpse of what happiness might have looked like for Naruto. My favourite part will always be that last scene with Iruka. It made me feel all bubbly

          <span style="display: none;" id="review180955">
        and sentimental like the first ever Naruto (Part I) episode. &quot;Villainous&quot; plot-wise, it was interesting but just okay.<br />
<br />
Style (art/sound):<br />
Kishimoto personally designed the characters for this movie so I can&#039;t really have too many complaints on the art. I found the AU characters&#039; designs quite amusing. Personally, I appreciate good soundtracks and I absolutely love that one motif in a lot of the tracks. I love it when one motif is played in different styles (i.e. sorrow, solemn, sweetness, rejoice, etc.). I would say that the sad/sweet tracks helped enhance the moment better than the fighting ones. Once again, the track that played during the last scene with Iruka gets me even more.<br />
<br />
Personal Enjoyment:<br />
As underwhelming as the plot is, I quite enjoyed this movie. There were at least two underlying &quot;themes&quot; and I sat through the movie a whole lot more comfortable than previous ones (as it sorta kinda not really ties in with the canon plot, as in you don&#039;t get a one-day female lead nor &quot;villain&quot;). It was nice to see what it would be like everything was kinda different, especially cute Uzumaki family moments. All in all, I personally don&#039;t think that this movie was a waste of my time and I&#039;m glad that I watched it.

    And then there’s a 6th………..<br />
<br />
About the STORY<br />
It’s so like Naruto series to twist the “normal-kind of storyline” and revive dead characters but this time in a different way. The drama of the movie is one of the most touching parts of its storyline; Naruto’s lack of family. It’s one of the most authentic dramas the series has. A very interesting plot compared to the previous movies where it was just the same old “a mission” kind of plot most particularly the unsuccessful previous two movies.<br />
<br />
About the CHARACTERS<br />
The characters made the story really fun and exciting most especially the “Menma” thing. It’s also interesting to see

          <span style="display: none;" id="review97787">
        everyone differently and to see Naruto have a family.<br />
<br />
About the ANIMATION<br />
The animation is as amazing as always befitting a movie and Naruto movie at that. it may not be as explosive as before but it is still amazing and exciting.<br />

About the ENJOYMENT<br />
The first thing I thought was, it would be boring because the previous two was really lame then Akatsuki appeared right off the bat and everything becomes awesome for me immediately. I bet that most of the Naruto fans will enjoy this one as we get to see lots of situation that we won’t be able to see in the original story. It’s like a very rare chance and among all the movies this is the first time that almost every elements are perfectly balance; action, comedy, animation, sounds, characters, and especially the drama. I strongly believe that makes this one by far the best among the series’ movies.<br />

    I&#039;ll just give a quick summary of the review:<br />
<br />
+ Decent plot involving use of personality swaps. The storyline is well written as many of the emotions and feeling could be felt from the characters. <br />
<br />
+ Consistent with action as the main series is<br />
<br />
+ The alternate personalities added humor to the movie (the interactions amongst each other proved comical at points). <br />
<br />
+Some changes in the characters/groups made certain scenes interesting. <br />
<br />
-The other chunin from the series (Shikamaru, Choji, Hinata, etc) had very little significance in the story. The story was hyped up about their change in personalities, but had very few scenes involving a majority of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review98573">
        the characters that built the hype for the movie. <br />
<br />
-The art seemed different and lazy at certain points. Some segments seemed to be missing detail that normally is covered in the series itself. <br />
<br />
Final Thoughts: <br />
<br />
Road to Ninja lived up to be a pretty good movie. It&#039;s not one of the best, but it definitely has some decent replay value to it. <br />
<br />
Recommend watching?: Yes

    **THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**<br />
<br />
From what I am able to see this movie has been rated to be the second best Naruto movie with its score but I can say that this is far from the truth.<br />
<br />
Story: (4/10)<br />
<br />
The story of Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 6 - Road to Ninja begins with a retelling of Minato and the Kyuubi. It then skips to the present with Naruto and his team fighting the revived versions of the Akatsuki and after the Akatsuki retreat Naruto and Sakura meet Tobi (Obito) who then sends them into a different world were everyone has the opposite personalities and now Naruto

          <span style="display: none;" id="review213466">
        and Sakura must find a way to get back to their own world. I found many problems with this story. One of them would be how all the characters from Konoha in the beginning of the movie all act like dicks to Naruto for no apparent reason and as well as the characters bringing up to event of becoming a jounin which the parents of the ninja have to give a recommendation letter in order for that to happen and that pretty much is rubbing it in Naruto&#039;s face that he has no parents. This with the combination of how his parents are alive in the opposite world causes a clear view of how the movie will end up. There was a twist that was added into the story that I was able to see from a mile away. The opposite personality gimmick gets old very quickly and the predictability of the movie just ends up making it boring.<br />
<br />
Art and Animation: (5/10)<br />
<br />
The art was very average and there was nothing very visually appealing about it. The animation was good with the explosions that were happening all the time and action scenes keeping the viewer interested in it.<br />
<br />
Sound: (5/10)<br />
<br />
There is nothing memorable about the soundtrack in this movie with just some generic music. The voice actors all did a good job like always.<br />
<br />
Characters: (4/10)<br />
<br />
Even though people would say that the characters are the best part about the movie, I thought that characters were all a jumbled mess. The positives about the characters is that showed some of the problems Naruto and Sakura had to go through and the opposite personalities of the other characters were fun to see at first. This is one of the first times were Naruto has been a useless character because he throughout the movie does nothing to help everybody and when he actually tries he messes up and gets somebody else hurt which is what Naruto doesn&#039;t do because he is usually the one that gets hurt for somebody else. Naruto also acted very whiny throughout it too until the ending. Like I said before the opposite personality thing gets old fast and gets pushed aside. What I mean about them getting old fast is how that their opposite personality is the only defining feature that they will have throughout the movie and won&#039;t have anything deeper added to them other than that and they get pushed aside in the movie very quickly in the movie which just makes them seem that they didn&#039;t contribute anything to the story. I didn&#039;t get why Tobi sent them to a different world in the first place even though I&#039;m sure that at that time Tobi could have easily overpowered Naruto and would have taken the kyuubi power from him and wouldn&#039;t have to go through the whole ordeal of taking him to a different world.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: (5/10)<br />
<br />
The fighting scenes were nice to look at and there was some interesting conflicts shown.<br />
<br />
Overall: (5/10)<br />
<br />
Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 6 - Road to Ninja is a movie that had potential to be an interesting movie but it had too many things that held it back.<br />
         <br />
<br />
