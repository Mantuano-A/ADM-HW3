    Kimi to Boku... You and me. In Japanese, this is a rather informal and comfortable way of saying the English equivalent, and it is a fitting title for the series. Though certainly not the most &quot;exciting&quot; show to air on Japanese television, it becomes strangely alluring in its own way, and leaves viewers wanting more.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
The story is rather laid back, not too complex. It doesn&#039;t focus on about saving the world, helping a friend in dire distress, or even falling in love (that&#039;s not to say that there aren&#039;t any sweet dilemmas present). It&#039;s a slice of life that revolves around the theme of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review48231">
        growing up and friendships that grow along with one&#039;s stature. Yes, the story revolves around 4 (then 5) males. At first, one feels like this could NEVER be anything but yaoi (male on male anime/manga), but it is anything but that. Instead, Kimi to Boku brings a new light on a what could be an &quot;over-done&quot; subject. Poetic prose seasons the the memories of the various protagonists who wistfully (and sometimes regretfully) reminisce the past, their experiences more than 10 years ago still having strong influences and ties to what is happening at the &quot;now&quot; of their life. As for romance, you&#039;ll have to see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
The art is also not of the &quot;spectacular, melts the eyes and makes them bleed&quot; type. Those who are looking for sophisticated backdrops and blinding visual effects should look elsewhere. However, as with many anime of this genre, the art compliments the story (indeed nearly every aspect of the anime) with its simplistic and relaxing tones and hues. Simple though it may be, some of the ending credit &quot;snapshots&quot; are sure to curve even the most stubborn of lips. It did mine.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The sound was what stood out to me at first. I understand it isn&#039;t for everyone, but with the reviews out now that say that its &quot;okay&quot; leave me confused. The opening (&quot;Bye Bye&quot; by the artist &quot;7!!&quot;) and ending (&quot;Nakumushi&quot; by the artist &quot;Miku Sawai&quot;) are perfectly in sync with the series, and are totally worth hearing in their full versions (you guys do this too, right?). Personally, I find these artists&#039; other songs worthwhile as well. As for the rest of the music, it isn&#039;t perfect, but it is certainly well-matched and well-placed in each episode, and at times you can find yourself tapping your foot or even rocking your head to that catchy guitar.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The other outstanding aspect of this anime are the characters. At first glance, they are flat and uninteresting. Four (then five, you&#039;ll understand what I mean) high school boys: A very feminine, long-haired Matsuoka Shun, two rather good-looking yet otherwise un-noteworthy twins (Yuuki and Yuuta) who only speak in monotone voices, and a seemingly stereotypical, steady-type nerd (Kaname -&gt; Megane). The fifth guy is something of a wild card. You&#039;ll see.<br />
<br />
But, as the story progresses, it&#039;s like watching a flower bloom. (Spare me your spit and jeers for saying it in such a way, but I won&#039;t take it back.) The artist really pay attention to little details, and create such depth in these characters that you&#039;ll find yourself wondering why you ever believed in Santa Claus. Each episode, viewers learn just a little bit more about these boys: what they were like when they were little and how they acted as opposed to how they are now - insignificant little details, things that seem unimportant yet hold some strange and precious place in their hearts. To these characters, the world is changed through these little details, and their bonds, it feels, are irreplaceable.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
If it was meant to be exciting, this anime is not that great. It would deserve those careless sixes and sevens and be overshadowed by better shows. But it seems the artist wants to do something else. What else is there to life besides head-pounding, heart-rushing battle? Simple, sweet, everyday life. A cup of tea with friends. Fretting over school and girls. It&#039;s these overlooked yet precious, precious things that one can only miss once they are over and naught but memories. Kimi to Boku brings wistfulness in a curious way, and stokes the fires of the heart. If anything, it&#039;s real art.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10.

    I HATE SCHOOL COMEIDES and sentimental twaddle and will not watch &quot;cute girls doing cute things.&quot;  -- BUT I LOVED KIMI TO BOKU. --  It &#039;s as easy to watch and as mesmerizing as a trout stream in the sunshine.  It just flows along, easy, and happy, with the occasional surprise.  Like potato chips I kept consuming one episode after another and was surprised when I hit ep 12.  With only one ep to go I was glad to know that a second season is slated for Spring 2012.<br />
<br />
It is a simple slice of life about four boys who have

          <span style="display: none;" id="review51367">
        been together since kindergarten plus one radical misfit that gets dropped in to the mix.  Sounds tedious, boring and trite, right?  It isn&#039;t.  It is funny without being silly and endearing without being sappy.  It&#039;s about a lot of little things we overlook or take for granted that make life good.  <br />
<br />
There is no action or adventure, no high drama, no random wacky silliness, no ecchi, no sci-fi or horror and IT IS NOT SHOUNEN-AI.  It is funny but not in an over the top guffawing kind of way but you will smile a lot, chuckle, and occasionally laugh out loud.  KtB is true slice of life about a few charming characters you&#039;d like to know personally.  <br />
<br />
Some say it has no plot.  I&#039;m not sure that is an accurate statement because each consecutive episode does build a bit on previous episodes as more and more is revealed about the character and characteristics of each player.  Some say it is a &quot;show about nothing&quot; and that I openly disagree with.  It is about love and acceptance, seeing someone&#039;s foibles and loving them just the same.  Yes I said love but I mean universal love and and not the romantic sort.  KtB is about friendship, reflection, and personal growth.  How is that &quot;about nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could care less about the opening and ending songs and found the sound track in no way annoying, jarring or distracting so it must have done its job well.  I found the voice actors very well suited to the characters.<br />
<br />
The art is nice.  It is as mellow as the overall tone of the show. Then there are the cats.  CATS?  Brilliant, beautifully executed and illustrated vignettes of cats mirroring the actions and attitudes of the human characters -- ored cats.  playful, mischievous cats, annoyed cats.  Each character has a signature cat that reflects his personality and character traits.  These aren&#039;t overly round, stylized cats but very realistic and richly detailed cats.  Ah, the Japanese do seem to appreciate and understand cats.  The &quot;cat mirrors&quot; is likely the most brilliant aspect of KtB.  Hope they continue it in the 2012.

    I myself think that Kimi to Boku is a must watch show. I personally think that it doesn&#039;t matter when and how often you watch it either. Kimi to Boku is one of those anime&#039;s where you can come home from a rough day of work and watch. For me, I thoroughly enjoyed Kimi to Boku and I hope that after reading this review, you will too.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
I really liked the story in Kimi to Boku. I like it&#039;s simple school life style and I myself believe that the way the way they went about making this genre work, and not get boring, was really

          <span style="display: none;" id="review183259">
        well done.<br />
Normally in a lot of slice of life, school life anime it&#039;s very easy to get bored. I&#039;m sure well all know this well. But with Kimi to Boku the story hooked me at the start. The story in Kimi to Boku was simple, yet effective. At the end of the anime I didn&#039;t feel the &#039;void of emptiness&#039; after watching it. Instead, I smiled to myself thinking, &quot;I really enjoyed that.&quot; <br />
Trust me on the fact that you&#039;ll laugh at the stupid things that happen and the giggles between characters.<br />
<br />
Art: 9<br />
For these kind of anime&#039;s I always think that it needs to be simple; and that&#039;s what Kimi to Boku did. It kept it&#039;s art simple and so, it wasn&#039;t sore on the eyes. After coming home from a hard day of work you don&#039;t particularly want to see vivid colors. The art style in Kimi to Boku was smooth, and I myself had no problems with it.<br />
It&#039;s very pretty.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8<br />
While watching Kimi to Boku I thought to myself every time  I heard a soundtrack play, &quot;I&#039;ve heard this before...&quot; The soundtracks in Kimi to Boku are very repetitive and so, it at times may not be ear candy. In the first half of the first episode of Kimi to Boku not much music played at all. Though, I believe myself that it was made like that to make the pacing seem slower and to make it seem more realistic. Towards the end of the anime, they play more soundtracks and for me, that&#039;s ok. I would&#039;ve put sound at a seven if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that even if the soundtrack is repeated more than a few times, they were good soundtracks. Kimi to Boku used the right soundtracks at the right time and that&#039;s not something every anime can do.<br />
The sound effects in Kimi to Boku weren&#039;t much to talk about but they were there. They made me laugh too. :)<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
Wow. This anime made me love every character. There was not one character I hated. The character development in this anime was very good and I became attached to them. What I was in awe about was the fact that even if a character only had one episode, you could still call them a character. They seemed just as important as the main characters and had an amazing amount of character development for such short time that they had. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
There&#039;s not much I can say here since I&#039;ve pretty much already stated above my opinion and enjoyment out of Kimi to Boku. Every end to every episode left me wanting more. It was a very enjoyable anime and if you decide to watch it then I hope you enjoy it too. I remember not being able to wait until I got home to watch this anime. I hope you feel that way also.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
Kimi to Boku is a hit or miss honestly. It&#039;s like marmite; you either love it or you hate it. The slice of life genre isn&#039;t something for everyone but, even if you dislike slice of life, give the first few episodes a try. I myself don&#039;t particularly watch slice of life unless it&#039;s striking, and this was. It seems simple yet the comedy and the characters in it will make you smile. The sound is good, the art is cute and smooth and the story is just what a normal highschooler may want their life to be like.<br />
Give Kimi to Boku a try, I really enjoyed it.

    Kimi to Boku is a series about a group of four (later five) teenage boys and them finding things to do in their everyday lives. And...that&#039;s it, really.<br />
<br />
KtB is truly a slice-of-life show, but I am of the opinion that even SOL series deserve actual plots and in this way, KtB falters. There isn&#039;t much plot to speak of. Most of the time, the &quot;plot&quot; deals with the boys doing ho-hum everyday things, like reliving childhood memories, drawing manga, or even contemplating what to do because they&#039;re bored (I kid you not). Every now and then, things get somewhere interesting - for example, the cultural

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50741">
        festival episodes were fun, as was the venture to the boys&#039; former middle school, where they meet Shun&#039;s younger brother. Other episodes were downright boring and entirely forgettable; these mostly dealt with the boys sitting around and talking about things (I can&#039;t even tell you what of because I don&#039;t remember and frankly don&#039;t care). Indeed, I nearly fell asleep during the first episode because all the characters did was talk and relive flashbacks that weren&#039;t that interesting.<br />
<br />
Now, a lacklustre plot can be somewhat forgivable if the series had great characters. For the first few episodes, our main cast of boys numbered four - Shun (the soft-spoken, effeminate one), Kaname (the straight man and the glasses guy), and Yuuki and Yuuta (the twins). However, they&#039;re all either so quiet or deadpan that they don&#039;t make for a very entertaining group to watch. Like I said, the first episodes deals entirely with them talking about things. Even the introduction of the stereotypical tsundere in the second episode doesn&#039;t help spice up what little plot there is. In fact, the tsundere, Masaki, is one of the more annoying characters, who is more &quot;tsun&quot; than &quot;dere&quot; and gets upset at the tiniest offer of help. For the record, she doesn&#039;t get much better by the end of the series.<br />
<br />
The group only really livens up when the fifth member, Chizuru, is added. His boundless energy and enthusiasm adds a different dynamic to the main cast - he contrasts well with the deadpan twins and the quieter Shun and gives the straight man Kaname a better character to work off of for comedic effect. At the same time, he adds a bit of a love triangle with Masaki (the tsundere). Still, Chizuru alone isn&#039;t enough to save the plot from its own blandness. Nevertheless, the show does become less boring with him around because at least when they sit around and talk, there&#039;s some energy in it.<br />
<br />
Also, in later episodes, the group comes across other characters who, through their own plots or development, give the main cast some depth that we would otherwise not see. For example, when Yuuta goes on a date with a shy classmate, we get a glimpse of his personality underneath his emotionless exterior. Unfortunately, such instances seem to occur only when they meet people outside their group rather than when the main cast is together. I would have liked to see the main guys develop within their group as well as without, like in the case of Ouran High School Host Club.<br />
<br />
Animation-wise, there isn&#039;t much to see. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s bad; it&#039;s just simple because that&#039;s all the show requires. Basically, there&#039;s nothing notable about it, good or bad.<br />
<br />
In terms of sound, the music, like the animation, isn&#039;t very notable or memorable for anything. I&#039;ll admit, though, I have a fondness for the OP &quot;Bye Bye&quot; by 7!!, which has cute melody and a catchy opening beat. I have no complaints about the voice actors/actresses, who I guess had to work within their given characterizations.<br />
<br />
So, really, is there anything truly notable about Kimi to Boku? Well, no. Is it a bad show? Well...that depends on how you see it. Frankly, I don&#039;t think of it as bad but it&#039;s far from memorable. Other slice-of-life series I&#039;ve seen had something to distinguish them - Aria had a beautiful utopian society with a dash of fantasy; K-ON! had catchy music and &quot;moe&quot; girls; Azumanga Daioh had off-beat humour and even more off-beat characters. Kimi to Boku has...cats? Look, I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m trying.<br />
<br />
If you like action, drama, and fast-pace plots, then Kimi to Boku is not for you. If you like slice-of-life, give it a try but if you don&#039;t like it by the third or fourth episode, it&#039;s probably not for you, either.<br />
<br />
EDIT: It&#039;s been about 2 years since I finished this series and wrote this review. Suffice it to say, I can barely remember a single thing about this series. It was simply that forgettable for me.

    This is my first time writing a review, so please be gentle, but Kimi to Boku more than deserves something nice being said about it for once. I&#039;m a huge fan of the manga, so I&#039;m a little biased, but, I&#039;ll keep focused on what my thoughts are for the anime only.<br />
<br />
-Story-<br />
<br />
The plot of this series revolves around five high school boys who have known each other since childhood. Kimi to Boku falls under the &#039;slice of life&#039; category, because that&#039;s exactly what it is. If you&#039;re expecting something that&#039;s action packed or has a fast pace, this anime will likely disappoint you, because it&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47239">
        neither. But, this is one of the reasons that this series is so great; it&#039;s simple. It deals with the every day lives of these five boys (Kaname, Shun, Yuuta, Yuuki, and Chizuru) and the people they interact with. Each episode they are faced with new life challenges that are easy for the viewer to relate to. Though, this series also focuses on the boys&#039; pasts, showing little segments to explain traits that they continue to show in present time or to reflect on a previous relationship with each other or one of the other characters. <br />
<br />
Drama hardly exists in Kimi to Boku, other than adorable, friendly squabbles or the occasional love interest dilemma. This, can either come across as boring to a viewer or as something that&#039;s soothing compared to the other anime that they might watch. To me, Kimi to Boku is a breath of fresh air. While other animes may be nerve-wrecking or stressful to watch, this anime is so enjoyable to me. Every time I sit down to watch it, I can just feel myself melt into the world of these characters and I find myself helplessly falling in love with their situations. <br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoy the slow pace of this anime. It&#039;s slow enough to simply enjoy watching it, but fast enough to where I&#039;m never bored watching it. <br />
<br />
-Art-<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is very similar to Hotta&#039;s art in the manga. Both are drawn simplistically, which fits perfectly with the series&#039; simplistic plot. The characters are drawn with detail that is just enough, not messy, but not overwhelmingly complex. Each character get&#039;s his or her own unique look and features, making them easy to distinguish between them and easy for someone who&#039;s new to the series catch on and remember their names. Although, something that I really enjoy with the anime is the beautiful pallet of colors. The anime has very soft, warm colors. The scenery of the backgrounds often involving cherry blossoms or beautiful sky images. The colors and the atmosphere of this anime only add to the beauty of this series&#039; complicated-simplicity.<br />
<br />
-Sound- <br />
<br />
The music is alright. The background music is not overwhelming and doesn&#039;t seem to distract the viewer from the character interactions, instead, it seems to just perfectly fit with the rest of the atmosphere. The opening and ending themes are cute, although, the music all together is not very memorable. It just fits.<br />
<br />
Rather than talking about the music in the series, I&#039;d like to stress how perfectly cast the VAs are for these characters. I&#039;m a fan of the drama CDs, so I didn&#039;t really know what I was expecting by being introduced to a new cast of VAs for the characters. I was a bit hesitant about it, to be honest. But, after watching the first episode, I was more than pleased. I actually had butterflies, because I think the cast did an incredible job portraying these characters exactly how they were meant to be shown. Shun is soft and meek, Kaname comes off being overwhelmed and aggravated, Chizuru is obnoxious and loud, the twins are smooth and perfectly quiet. These aspects of their personalities are easily shown in the VAs&#039; voices. They are easy to decipher from one another, which is especially important with the twins. <br />
<br />
-Character-<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been stating over and over how delightfully simplistic this series is, but the characters are anything but simple. Each character is something special, each character feels like a main character, and each character is able to blend with the rest of the cast. Focusing on our main five boys, each of them have a special relationship with one another and interact with each other in different ways. Though, one criticism that this series has gotten is the &#039;BL&#039; aspects that the show gives off. It&#039;s all about perception, if you want to see a deeper relationship between any of these characters, then you can easily see one, if you chose to view them as just being a set of close friends, then the BL elements are hardly overwhelming. These characters are for everyone who wants to enjoy them, this series is NOT just eye candy for fangirls. <br />
<br />
I won&#039;t go into the detail of each of the boys, to avoid spoilers, but, I think their different personalities and the different ways that they react to each other is something that&#039;s very special. Each character is incredibly likeable and each one is someone that the viewer could relate to someone they know in real life, or even themselves. <br />
<br />
I have nothing bad to say about any character in this entire series (even the ones that have not made their appearances yet) and that&#039;s something really miraculous for me. I generally like only a few characters from each series, but, I can honestly say that I love every single character very dearly and have related to each of them in some situation or another. This is by far my favorite part of this series. <br />
<br />
-Enjoyment-<br />
<br />
What&#039;s not to enjoy about Kimi to Boku? Nothing is unlikable about adorable characters interacting with each other in adorable ways. There&#039;s heart, there&#039;s humor, there&#039;s tiny bits of drama, and just a lot of love between the cast. I fully enjoy this series and find myself laughing at various times, although, it seems like every time I watch a new episode, the smile won&#039;t disappear from my face. It&#039;s impossible for me not to enjoy watching these character&#039;s bonds grow and change, and watch the events that lead up to these changes. <br />
<br />
-Overall-<br />
<br />
This anime gets high marks from me, especially because it&#039;s an adaptation. Usually, adaptions are done poorly, and viewers often get the wrong idea about the series by the lame anime adaption that an amazing manga got; though with Kimi to Boku, I love both the anime in the manga. I highly recommend anyone who&#039;s falling in love with these characters, or even enjoying themselves in the slightest, to read the manga. The manga is even more incredible than the anime, although, the anime is very close to being perfection. There are, of course, changes that have been made in the adaption, but, this series has a very nice flow, and I am ecstatically awaiting seeing the rest of this season&#039;s episodes, as well as the second season.

    Kimi to boku...<br />
... well of course one of my all time favourites!<br />
Male or female, old or young; it&#039;s an anime for everyone!<br />
<br />
Let us begin with the Story:<br />
It&#039;s simple, not too complex - but that&#039;s why it&#039;s so wonderful watching it! Because everything that happens, happens so naturally, without any kind of pressure. It&#039;s such a pleasant story! And as the story goes on, you might begin to care about these guys!<br />
That&#039;s the next strong point; the characters! When I started watching it, I liked them all form the very first minute, the very first episode! They&#039;ve got all their own personality, filled with their own

          <span style="display: none;" id="review169859">
        skills and weakness, like in the real world! They get along, more or less, with each other in a quite lovely way, even tough at first they don&#039;t seem so close to each other. But as soon as Chizuru appears... ou well, just watch it ;) <br />
<br />
The Art &amp; Sound of the anime, well, one word: beautiful!<br />
Even the silent, sometimes seemingly unimportant background music add so much emotions and life to the anime, that, when you&#039;re later listening only to the Music you might ask yourself; have I heard this? Was it in the anime?<br />
<br />
I felt so happy watching it and I always wanted more, more, more!<br />
So if you haven&#039;t yet watched it; do it!<br />
If you haven&#039;t had the time; take it!<br />
It&#039;s worth watching it!

    What? An anime with 5 male characters as leads? That&#039;s gotta be BL and bet its nothing more than bait for fangirls, right? WRONG! Kimi to Boku has nothing of the sort. Its simply a very pleasant anime to watch for both guys and girls. I&#039;m a straight guy myself and I had no trouble watching this so lets get that misconception out of your mind.<br />
<br />
So the anime&#039;s about a group of friends. Four childhood friends and a blondie who happened to get intertwined with them. There&#039;s no plot, so to say coz the anime just shows you incidents from their high-school years but that&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50485">
        more than enough to tell you that this anime is only for those who truly enjoy Slice of Life themes and love simplicity amalgamated with humor. For those who don&#039;t... Best move along, find something more mature.<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, the anime is simple. Its art is simple. The music is simple. The jokes are simple. And then there are the characters who seem simple enough but are so much more than that. Again, each of the 5 characters behave uniquely and they&#039;re all opposites of each other, in a way. Even the twins are distinguishable by actions, clearly. As the story builds on, throwing anecdote after anecdote of their lives, these instances only get funnier by the episode. The characters are drawn to look very adorable, though some of the female characters are hard to distinguish from each other. The pace is kinda laid back and slow but still engaging with all the moments that can either make you laugh or urge you to recollect instances from your past. With the first season, it has also ventured into mildly romantic themes though it&#039;d really take the next season to tell you where they lead. All in all, the focus is solely friendship and they&#039;ve nailed that through, perfectly. They&#039;ve also got cats. A lot of &#039;em.<br />
<br />
I was blown away by both, the opening theme as well the ending song, especially the ending where they&#039;ve applied the beautiful effect of cross-fading the start of the song with the last few seconds of the anime which makes the episode all the more special. The rest of the music that is featured is also pleasant and fitting for the setting of the anime. Not much to criticize since the anime has accomplished all it had aimed for. The only thing might be the lack of an evident storyline but it makes up by delivering in everything in a non-cliche, non-cheesy manner. It starts off rocky but peaks quickly and stays there. So do persevere the initial 2~4 episodes, at least. Did I mention they have a lot of cats? :3<br />
<br />
So what is Kimi to Boku?<br />
It is the perfect episodic anime to add to a tough day at work since it calms you down perfectly without provoking the least complex of thoughts. I recommend this to everyone looking for something light to watch while following something rather heavy. In my opinion, unexpectedly, the best anime of the Winter 2011 releases from amongst those I&#039;ve watched.<br />
<br />
My Evaluation: 9/10

    It&#039;s really hard reviewing a series after it first came out, so please bare with me. (Note: this review will be updated throughout the course of the released episodes)<br />
<br />
Kimi to Boku (You and Me) is an anime that revolves around 5 childhood male friends who have started their second year of high school.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
--------<br />
<br />
The story is pretty fair so far. Since it is a slice-of-life anime, the pacing might be a little too slow for some people, whereas others can find it to be calming. I personally think that this anime could develop into something bigger and more entertaining as the episodes progress. There is so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review45305">
        much potential for a slice-of-life revolving around an entire male cast and their daily lives, unlike the typical &#039;moe girl&#039; one. This might be one of those few rare findings where the entire main cast consists of boys, but it does not belong to a shounen-ai category, which is a good thing for those who are not a fan of that genre, although shounen-ai lovers can enjoy Kimi to Boku the same.<br />
<br />
Art<br />
--------<br />
<br />
The art is &#039;ok&#039;. I have not much to comment about it. It isn&#039;t very detailed or very plain, but somewhat in the &#039;neutral&#039; zone. One thing I immediately noticed upon watching this series is the character&#039;s &#039;eyes&#039;. Even though there is not much to complain about them (they ARE rather unique in terms of style), but in the end you get used to this art type and go along with it. The colors are pretty calming and soothing.<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Not much to say about the sound. It&#039;s pretty decent, and flows along with the plot line. The slow scores and cheerful ones fill in the gaps of the &#039;everyday life&#039; feel.<br />
<br />
Character<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The characters are pretty likable, and since this series has just started, we don&#039;t know much about their background. They all fit into the typical stereotypes, although some produce a good fair amount of uniqueness in them. In the end, the viewer is able to relate to and enjoy the character&#039;s actions.<br />
<br />
Shun -&gt; Many complain that he looks like a girl, but because of promotional art, we know that he&#039;ll soon cut his hair (maybe that will bring all the &#039;complaints&#039; down). He&#039;s a pretty likable character and is the &#039;optimistic&#039; one out of the group.<br />
<br />
Yuki -&gt; Likes manga, the younger of the twin brothers. Is quiet.<br />
<br />
Yuta -&gt; The older twin, talks a bit more. Not much is known about him, till now.<br />
<br />
Kaname -&gt; The strict one who keeps all the friends in order. Despite the fact that I don&#039;t really relate characters from different series, Kaname gave me the &#039;Kyouya&#039; feeling (Kyouya from Ouran High School Host Club).<br />
<br />
Chizuru -&gt; Still did not make his appearance.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The pace is slow, but mellow. This might change after more episodes are released though. overall, I think one can enjoy Kimi to Boku pretty well. If you hate slow every-day-life ongoings, then I don&#039;t recommend this series, although, as I mentioned before, this is an &#039;early series&#039; review, so this might change with the introduction of more characters, and possibly a &#039;plot&#039;.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
7/10<br />
Decent anime with quirky characters and a stable storyline. As I mentioned (countless of times) this might change soon (my rating might either rise or drop). If you&#039;re a fan of slice of life and would like an anime that focuses on the everyday life of male students, then Kimi to Boku is your anime.<br />
<br />

    It&#039;s not a Boy&#039;s Love so what&#039;s the point in watching this?<br />
<br />
I love slice of life animes, I try to look for them whenever I can, and when I say Slice of Life i mean true Slice of life, not Slice of life in space or slice of life with magical powers. What I love about slice of life animes is the realism with the stories in characters, I love watching things that could possibly happen in real life. Sadly there are too many supernatural stories listed as Slice of life. So when I read the description for Kimi to Boku I was really happy,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review46849">
        a true slice of life story FINALLY! I was eager to sit down and watch.<br />
<br />
The first episode introduce us to the characters who had been friends for many years blah blah. I won&#039;t go into the details because you should know the story by now from reading the description.<br />
<br />
The first episode wasn&#039;t that exciting, but I forgave its lack of excitement because it was the first episode and we were just getting to know the characters and at first I thought the random cat shots were odd, but they grew on me and actually it is the only thing about this show that is interesting.<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t get me wrong, the show had some good episodes, such as the one with Yuki playing with a foreign boy when they were young. It was cute and just shows that even if kids can&#039;t speak each other&#039;s languages they will find ways to get around that and have fun.<br />
<br />
However, the good is not enough to keep me glued to the story..why? Because there is no story. So far each episode is more like a &quot;this happens in this episode&quot; type of deal. Such as Episode five can be wrapped up as &quot;Girl loses key chain&quot; The fourth episode was &quot;Kaname gets sick&quot; this is really a nothing happens show. I guess it wouldn&#039;t be so bad if the characters were interesting, but they aren&#039;t. They are all stereotypes you can find in other animes like Ouran Host Club, except Ouran host club characters were actually fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Not only are the characters uninteresting but the overuse of flashbacks really weigh the show down because they have nothing to do with anything that is happening in the episode, but then again since nothing is happening in the episode the flashbacks seem even more pointless. Flashbacks should enhance the story while giving the audience important info. Do we really need to know for the one millionth time that Kaname had a crush on his Kindergarten teacher? I think we have had four flashbacks on that alone. yep four on just that and we are only on episode five. (Although, thankfully there were none in the fifth) this show relies heavily on flashback storytelling, but the flashbacks leads to nowhere. i found myself not really looking forward to the next episode and I only watched the fifth episode to give it a decent chance.<br />
<br />
Here are my pet peeves that really makes me not want to continue:<br />
<br />
That little girl is annoying. What is up with animes that either have the super sweet boring girl or the annoying brat b**ch? Like girls are all one extreme or the other. Why can&#039;t they just have a cool girl to hang out with, who is regular and likes to play around too?<br />
<br />
Shun, the pink haired boy is the male version of the super sweet boring chick. Now look, I don&#039;t mind girly boys but don&#039;t throw a girly boy into the mix and then not give me some sort of a gay storyline. at least attempt a coming out story (although I&#039;m sick of those at least it is something) and no he doesn&#039;t have to fall for one of his friends (although at least there would be an actual story here). seriously, this kid is just gay, so gay his pillow was pink and had ruffles on it when they were kids. If they try to make him straight by giving him a female love interest (and no that annoying little brat is not a love interest) then I would just laugh cause he obviously does not like Va***as and neither does Yuki(one of the twins) for that matter. But he just stands around as the sickeningly sweet mother figure of the group.<br />
<br />
Chizuru Tachibana. Soooo he was a German (I had to correct this, I thought Russian at first) boy who could not speak Japanese, yet not he is the most Japanese like out of all of them. And his name irks me more than anything. Why couldn&#039;t the writer look online or something and find a name suitable to his nationality?? I didn&#039;t know he was half Japanese until i read the synopsis here but it still irks me because why does he have to be half Japanese? Oh yeah so they wouldn&#039;t have to waste time looking up foreign names. <br />
<br />
Okay I&#039;ve said enough. But this all leads back to my first sentence. I&#039;m not some yaoi maniac that NEEDS yaoi in every story, but since there is no plot going on here they might as well give us some BL to make this worth looking at.

    Extremes can fail, even in anime, but Kimi to Boku pulls it off.  This is a show based on the manga of the same name, that in a phrase is the Seinfeld of highschool anime shows.<br />
<br />
No, I&#039;m not referring to its popularity or critical reception, but to the fact that while most other shows have a gimmick, Kimi to Boku is essentially a show about nothing.  This is slice of life anime taken to its extremes, and as someone who enjoys the genre (guilty pleasure), it&#039;s sort of fun. <br />
<br />
Early reviews of the series berated it for its predictability  &quot;oh there&#039;s the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50801">
        tsundere, we know how that will turn out!&quot; but the show takes those expectations and turn them on its head.  The character is quickly relegated to a supporting role and exits the narrative until much later, and ultimately doesn&#039;t affect the narrative in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
Although there is the faintest character and narrative arc, each of season 1&#039;s 13 episodes are essentially self-contained vignettes on the life of a group of high school kids (mainly focusing on the boys).   Call it gender preference, but in a way, the focus just on the male shenanigans sort of reminds me of my own high school experience with my clique of friends.  The romantic melodrama is relegated to the side.<br />
<br />
If, after all this, you&#039;re still undecided on whether to take the plunge,  I can also mention Cats.  Yes, this show cuts away to shots of Cats and kittens as a kind of narrative punctuation, ending a scene, splitting a scene of exclaiming a scene.  <br />
<br />
Oh, the watercolor look that seems to be in vogue of late also works brilliantly in this show and features one heck of an opening song.  I&#039;ve  drifted away from JPOP since graduating from university but Bye Bye! is one catchy tune that I can&#039;t stop playing.<br />
<br />
Kimi to Boku isn&#039;t going to win any awards or top anyone&#039;s lists, but it is genuine, and just a lot fun to watch.

    Heartwarming and funny moments passed between friends. This show has to be one of the sweetest ones I seen so far. At first I didn&#039;t think I would like it due to the fact there were no main female characters. How could I simply relate? But after watching it I realized male or female, young or old, this show will touch your heart. <br />
<br />
Story: 10/10<br />
<br />
Now, usually I don&#039;t like stories that don&#039;t really progress. But in Kimi to Boku I thought it was a plus. It one of those show that are just so fun to watch and leave you feeling bubbly inside. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
<br />
The

          <span style="display: none;" id="review99505">
        art actually added to the bubbly feeling effect. Every episode or so they would stop at a sweet momment and show the picture in painted form. I don&#039;t know why, but in doing so they really made me look at the artistic parts of the show. <br />
<br />
Sound: 10/10<br />
<br />
Can I just say I haven&#039;t heard one song on this show that I didn&#039;t like. Each of the songs are now downloaded to my computer. I&#039;m serious, it all surrounds that good time feeling. The songs make the show that much sweeter. Even the seemingly unimportant background music add so much life to the show. <br />
<br />
Characters: 10/10<br />
<br />
At first the characters seemed pretty bland, and not so friendly. Seriously the only nice one out of the group was Shun. And I couldn&#039;t really see them as childhood friends. Even in the summary it says they are neither good nor bad friends. Which is pretty sad.<br />
<br />
But then the transfer student comes into the picture.<br />
<br />
I really think that the transfer student,  Chizuru, is the ribbon that <br />
ties the group of friends together, because the first few episodes I was wondering why they didn&#039;t seem that close. But after Chizuru comes into the picture. It seems they all get along like they should have in the beginning. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
<br />
The main thing was Enjoyment with this. I actually felt happy watching this, It has a real calming effect for some reason.<br />
<br />
Then after I finished it and got back to real life I realized how lonely I was. But the point is, the captures you&#039;re attention in a real subtle way.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
<br />
Really, this is going to be one of my new favorites. I say you should drop all the suspicions or doubts you may have and just watch it. You won&#039;t regret it!

    -my first review, be gentle! I just wanted to tell everyone what i feel about this anime, that i feel very close to me-<br />
<br />
Have you ever had a group of friends you care a lot? Kimi To Boku is a story about the everyday life of five teens, bound together by the most beautiful relationship that can be established between people: friendship. Representing quite normal situations, Kimi To Boku can warm the heart of the spectator, through the use of beautiful phrases, moving soundtracks, and the feeling of closeness with the situations that happen to the protagonists. If you have special friends in your life,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50203">
        you would understand that Kimi To Boku is a much more deep and moving anime than it seems. But if you don&#039;t, you&#039;ll maybe just enjoy a normal slice-of-life anime, without knowing how much fantastic this anime is.<br />
<br />
Story: 9<br />
Kimi to Boku has no particular plot, so it&#039;s not fair to give full marks to it. However, the simplicity represented by this anime succeeds in every way to involve the viewer, making it enjoyable until the end of each episode. I found great the use of past scenes of the protagonists, which outline a simple but also stable plot. Also, some scenes will make you laugh out loud, but other scenes are very touching. It&#039;s impossible to be bored watching this anime.<br />
<br />
Art: 10<br />
The art of Kimi to Boku is very simple, yet so beautiful. First, it is almost totally devoid of the stereotype of the &quot;unnatural colored hair&quot; typical of Japanese cartoons (except for Shun, who has red hair, but hey, even I have natural red hair, so it&#039;s okay!). The style vaguely reminds me of other animes as Usagi Drop, that I&#039;ve always praised for its exquisite designs and vibrant colors. Another thing to praise are the drawings of cats in Kimi to Boku, almost perfect, they look so real.<br />
<br />
Sound: 10<br />
Probably, the soundtrack to Boku Kimi is the best thing of all the anime. Starting from the opening, which I believe is one of the best among all the anime ever made, until the ending, which is also wonderful, all the soundtracks in it are very well made, and that&#039;s especially thanks to them that the whole anime creates an atmosphere of happiness mixed with a nostalgic feeling. It gives the spectator the sensation of good memories, remembered with nostalgia and melancholy, which is perfect in the anime context.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
The 5 main characters are different from the typical anime chracter stereotype.<br />
Shun is feminine, tender and altruist, the typical &quot;good person&quot; that can hardly be found as a main character in an anime.<br />
Yuta, Yuki and Kaname have kinda the same cool attitude, but they&#039;re nothing like the typical cool characters which not comunicate with anyone and are closed in themselves.<br />
Chizuru is the classical genki boy, maybe the only stereotype in the serie, but also a good character that i&#039;ve appreciated a lot.<br />
I also love the other characters: they are more attached to the classical stereotypes, but their presence in the anime is very important for the plot develop.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I love this anime. As I said, the fantastic soundtrack, the funny situations, the never boring characters, the good art and the heart-warming situations make this anime very enjoyable and watchable by everyone.<br />
<br />
Overall: 10<br />
<br />

    Kimi to Boku has a simple plot which tells the everyday life experiences of 5 highschool boys and reminiscing their childhood memories together. Though the story isn&#039;t complex, it isn&#039;t boring to watch and it has a natural comedy in it. If you are a teenager, you can somehow relate on their experiences...<br />
<br />
when i first found this anime, I thought it was boring because of the drawing and simplicity of plot. But, as I watched it, it is rather enjoyable and fun to watch. I became fond of each of the characters because of their personalities and the way they relate and care for each

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50365">
        other.<br />
<br />
It really made me laugh and smile. :)<br />
<br />
also! I liked it because there are a lot of cats [which sometimes represents the characters of the story] which are really adorable. X3<br />
<br />
[looking forward for Kimi to Boku season 2!]

    I&#039;m a fan of slice of life animes, and Kimi to Boku just gives that to such fan.<br />
<br />
It is very slice of life, there&#039;s no plot and every episode has different events. <br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
There&#039;s really no plot and it is what slice of life is great for, you don&#039;t really need one. You can just have fun on watching the happenings of five high school students and their funny relationships with other characters. There&#039;s a bit of romantic story in each episode tackling all of the characters. <br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
They say that this anime&#039;s art isn&#039;t noteworthy but I don&#039;t think so. The art is very expressive and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review179415">
        every time they give off a joke or just doing stuff they have this kawaii expression that would make you burst to laughing.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
This anime got all you need for awesome JPOP music, this has a wonderful opening courtesy of both 7 Oops and Tomohisa Sako... just wonderful and very wonderful ending themes and background music in climatic scenes it just captures the moment and would make you watch more. <br />
<br />
The voice acting in this anime is so great. Shun&#039;s voice delivers what the character is all about, feminine and kawaii, it just awesome, I love his voice. Chizuru also has a wonderful voice, energetic and fun that truly makes him lovable. All the other characters have good voice actors.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
<br />
This anime has outstanding characters. Even though you would see Kaname, as the four eyed character, there&#039;s something that would make you care for him and love him. Shun is very likable and beats the moe characters in other shows (and he doesn&#039;t even try being cutesy). Yuuki is awesome so does his twin Yuuta and their tag team are very much awaited in every episode. We also can&#039;t have this show without Chizuru that brightens every episode with amazing punch lines. Surprisingly Masaki goes a great character development.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
I ENJOYED IT A LOT!!!!!!!!! AND I MEAN A LOT!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a must watch anime that would hook you from beginning to end.

    I don&#039;t really know how to explain this anime, since I&#039;ve only watched the first episode. However, the first episode so far, in my opinion, as for as a slice of life genre, is really enjoyable. I find Kimi to Boku really cute. <br />
It&#039;s a bit slow, then again it is the first episode only. I love the adorable flashbacks. <br />
Maybe I&#039;m just being biased at the same time because I just have this huge attraction to pretty boys, and Shun is such a pretty boy; He&#039;s way too cute.<br />
The art is really really nice though. I think I will end up really liking this

    Re Review  : ) I love Slice of life anime. Kimi to boku or( You and Me)  is about 4 childhood friends who are now in their High School year.  They meet another new  friend Chizuru who quickly becomes one of their best friends. He makes their daily lives entertaining and interesting. The story of Kimi to boku deals with every day life which everyone who watches this anime can relate too- whether it be love life  friendship, etc.  I love the Op and ED song as it fits this anime perfectly : )  Kimi to Boku has

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47655">
        tisi relaxing feeling every time i watch this show. I would recommend this anime to anyone who loves Slice of Life genre : ) Score 10/10 <br />
<br />
Re edit(after completing the series).I&#039;ve enjoyed the 13 episode ride of Kimi to Boku. I feel i am a closer to them now : ).  Our lovable 5 main characters have learned something new about themselves and from each other as they continue to be closer friends. I wonder what will happen in Season 2 ( which starts in April)?? Will they still be friends till the end after High School??College??Married??ETC    I still give this series 10/10.

    At first when I started seeing this show really thought he would be more or even get to see the first episode and then leave it a little sideways, but one day I decided to see him again until the end and I confess that surprised me time and regretted not seeing him until the end from the beginning.<br />
<br />
(Update: I just saw the anime, very good!)<br />
<br />
Kimi to Boku, this show is really fantastic. He can do a very good connection between the characters, story and comedy, something few shows of this genre can do.<br />
He tells the story of four boys during childhood friends from high

          <span style="display: none;" id="review71171">
        school live in situations where ordinary life of a student, Yuuki, Yuuta (they are brothers), Shun and Kaname give life to this show and are responsible for the success of this true work while Shun is more delicate and at times looks like a woman and is more fanciful, like cooking, Kaname makes the style more serious, studious and learned (but do not think that it is not funny!) and finally Yukki and Yuuta twin brothers where each one has its own personality and the same time you like surprises and confuses dois.No wait until a show with adventure, drama, action, he has nothing but it is a nice anime to watch and very fluid and clean.<br />
<br />
His comedy is not forced in any way and is really fun is natural, loose, makes you laugh in every episode you watched, linked to good music that combines with past scenes, great graphics are extremely detailed and engaging characters that you can identify the voice acting is particularly good and is the highlight of this show dubbing combine comedy with an amazing way and that the brightness of the show, I think the show just becomes funny because of dubbing done extremely well and I believe anime genre for those who really his strong point but this has to be is meaningless and lifeless, each genre needs a strong point such as suspense, mystery songs have happy and funny ends the show as well as an anime adventure can not only obscure songs, but continued to speak well of the show, it&#039;s really amazing how well the producers chose the songs for each scene, and how each character has their own life and still the place for a bit of romance but do not expect the anime to focus on it after his main genre that is not (as much as an anime has always various genres will focus on one of them and Kimi to Boku is comedy! romance not) the novel appears in a few episodes I believe in a 4 but is well it feito.Each episode has a different story which makes everything funnier and more Slice of Lifes animes that may seem a bit monotonous this genre is on the rise lately and is constantly evolving and this show is proof he&#039;s no little boring and monotonous and really stands out from others in the same genre, it takes real life situations and turn them into a really fun comedy.<br />
<br />
================================================== ========<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Since this is an anime comedy is difficult to give a note to his story as each episode it is one different story with a beginning middle and end their focus is not on it but I will try an average of each episode and give an overall score.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The anime has 3 strengths, and art is one of them (next to the sound and the comedy and the characters) really his art is extremely detailed and well done, you do not notice major flaws and scenarios are well defined and you get to itself felt in the scene as the character.<br />
<br />
Characters: 8<br />
Another strong point of the anime, the characters are not fully worked in front psychological, sentimental, but somehow they captivate you and you begin to get involved in the story with them, you start to like them and identify with them, is Funny how each character had his personality well developed and has its special peculiarities such as the twins Yuuki and Yuuta while the other one loves mangoes does not support this and do not even have a special taste, particular attention to the character Shun that in some moments recalls a woman is really funny how it looks like one, another highlight for the character I most identified myself Tachibana and the silly boy group that does everything becomes still best to watch each scene it really is incredible funny!<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
One of the high points of the anime really your sound is excellent since the opening song to the closing and the songs used in each scene and how producers had amazing care of this detail seems so irrelevant but that&#039;s life when the anime is as well used if this show really fantastic!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9<br />
FUN!! so you will not miss seeing this show, it is easy to watch, is not complex does not have those dramas and complicated things to understand he is totally straight, fluid and extremely funny! I believe that everything that purports to show he can do at a high level.<br />
<br />

    Dull Synopsis, you would think at first. You&#039;d think the anime will be just a cliche. But I promise you, you&#039;ll be surprised. <br />
<br />
It&#039;s true, the story is not one in a million. Yet, it&#039;s strangely warmer than all the other anime I&#039;ve watched. It&#039;s not just about highschool or friendship, it&#039;s about intimacy between male characters you never see in other anime. Not that it&#039;s a shonen ai. It&#039;s what I would call a true yet enjoyable slice of life story. <br />
<br />
The Characters are my favorite part. Distinct, yet believable. They are funny, but not outrageous. By the end of the first episode, I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review47471">
        fell in love with them. The interactions between each character and another is amusing. <br />
<br />
Overall, this anime is not Gintama. It&#039;s not Naruto or death note. It has a completely different feel to it. Yet, in it&#039;s own category, I would say it&#039;s one of the best. In fact, when I noticed that it was only rated 7, I looked through all my old emails to find the password to myanimelist, just to sign in and vote. <br />

    THIS IS MY SECOND TIME WATCHING THIS SERIES AND I&#039;VE ALREADY GOT THE FEELS FROM WATCHING THE FIRST EPISODE!<br />
<br />
Like I said, this is my second time watching the series so I&#039;ve really missed Kimi to Boku (KB for short). I absolutely regret not re watching this anime anytime sooner! At first when the anime came out I&#039;d always get exited every week after school to watch the anime- though I haven&#039;t felt much anticipation since so I&#039;ve always thought KB was a delightful series.<br />
<br />
Kimi to Boku would be your typical cute and wonderful slice of life shoujo anime, revolving around four childhood friends (basically best

          <span style="display: none;" id="review104849">
        friends)Tsukahara Kaname, Matsuoka Shun, Asaba twins Yuuki and Yuuta, that have known each other since preschool and now are second year high schoolers. The group starts having new adventures like meeting new friends such as Chizuru and Masaki, also bearing several sentimental moments along the way. Though this might be the case, I felt that the boys (Masaki isn&#039;t a main) really had a firm, crisp, bond, being   much better than the usual slice of life anime- with the fact of being super adorable!<br />
<br />
Because of the anime being called You and me in English, (after being such a slowpoke) when I watched the anime again this gave me a thought of what ever affects you in the group affects everyone else too, giving me the idea of  that whatever moments you go through, all of them will embrace the happiness and pain with you. This gave me the reason of thinking that KB really is a lovely heartwarming show that any human being could watch anytime, making you laugh or cry you&#039;ll be feel merry at any moment you watch the anime. I couldn&#039;t help but realize that I smiled at every episode, also resulting in  a few tears of happiness too. I could re watch Kimi to Boku almost anytime, being a favorite that won&#039;t be scraped off my list anytime soon!<br />
<br />
Kimi to Boku really is a beautiful yet simple story, with a better friendship like nothing else. These passionate moments could make you feel fluffy  in the inside often. Could this be captivation? Joy? Or just being emotional?<br />
<br />
All I know is that Kimi to Boku really makes me feel happy.

    This is a strangely addictive overdose of easy-going saccharine slice of life sweetness. I mean, I thought the first episode was totally bleh and yet I kept watching and in the end I became addicted. I hear cocaine works like that. Oh, wait, I wasn&#039;t supposed to say that out loud.  Ahem, anyway, on we go…<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
The story is about the everyday lives of five friends. And when I mean everyday I mean hardcore everyday. There are exciting occurrences like buying stuff from vending machines, eating lunch and making photocopies (I&#039;m not shitting you, this really happens). And yet, despite the uneventful storyline, this show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review50199">
        becomes strangely addictive. Perhaps it is the innocence and sweetness it exudes, perhaps it&#039;s the nostalgia of the happy schooldays you never had or even the ideal picture of friendship it presents. Whatever the reason, it is a very captivating story despite the detail that NOTHING HAPPENS! There is no conflict, no angst, no drama just a series of sweet little nothings. Sometimes, that is just what you need. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Twins Yuuta &amp; Yuuki: are a pair of lazy deadpan overachievers who love trolling people. At first, I did not much take to them because they were strictly reactive and passive characters. Yet, in the end they prove to be the source of some extremely snarky comedy moments. <br />
Kaname: is the exemplary, rigid student with a fetish for older women. His function is to be the straight man in many of the funny moments. <br />
Shun: is a totally girly boy who is gentle, kind, sensitive and loves baking and the colour pink. He provides the group with emotional support and he&#039;s also my ideal wifey…oh, wait, I wasn&#039;t supposed to say that out loud. Ahem…moving on. <br />
Chizuru: is the outsider that eventually becomes a part of the group. Many think he is an annoying, hyperactive brat but if you think about it his character is really necessary. He is the epitome of an energetic, active character. This is a quality none of the other characters possess, hence he is needed to balance things out. <br />
So, there you have it. At first glance the characters appear overly simplistic yet as you continue watching you see a wonderful fleshing out process. In the end you feel as if you actually know them and would really like spending time with them.<br />
<br />
Animation:<br />
Nothing stellar and often sub-par. Yet this is not a show that requires flashy visuals so it makes no difference really. There is a lot of empty space, pastel colours and soft movements. Very soothing to the eye; it&#039;s like eating cotton candy actually. <br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
The sound was so discreet I don&#039;t even remember it being there. I mean, there must have been some sound but for the life of me I can&#039;t recall any of it. Well, maybe I was just so focused on wanting Shun for my pet. Oh, wait, I wasn&#039;t supposed to say that out loud…<br />
OP: A sequence of small moments to introduce the characters matched by a simple, bubbly little ditty. <br />
ED: A sequence of static pictures (stills: the budget anime&#039;s best friend) matched by a simple, cute little ballad. <br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
This anime is basically worth a 7 but I am giving it +1 for the frequent, random shots of freaky cats. <br />
Will this show appeal to most people? No. It is too slow and uneventful. But if, on the other hand, you are fond of slice of life, sweet innocence and soothing lassitude you will like this. I certainly find myself looking back on it fondly and might actually want to re-watch it someday.<br />
