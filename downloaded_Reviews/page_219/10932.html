    Sigh...I really tried to like this show. I have seen all the other Yu-Gi-Oh shows to completion despite a few of them being a chore to get through but this is just the last straw.<br />
<br />
My main issue about this show is rush duels. Quite frankly, I think they are retarded and uninspired. I mean come on. Summon every monster in your hand for free and next turn draw a fresh hand? If I was still playing the card game, I’d be infuriated because there’s no strategy or thought process in this. I’m sitting here watching the duels and in my head I’m thinking “man this

        is just not exciting or fun at all.” The show is just too goofy to the point where I can’t get invested in anything. I don’t care if the main characters win because why should I? Yuga is a boring protagonist because he doesn’t have any depth. All he wants to do is spread rush duels to everyone. “Of course he doesn’t have any depth. He’s just a kid.” I couldn’t agree more. Focusing on elementary school kids is the most uninteresting thing ever. What’s next toddlers? Might as well.<br />
<br />
Regardless of this, Seven’s issue is NOT the show itself. The show is fine...as a comedy. It’s what it represents to the Yu-Gi-Oh community as a whole. Naturally older fans are going to look at this and think “this is childish.” What made the original 3 shows so beloved and memorable is that they had characters who were older than the target audience with some dark and mature themes. This is called instilling imagination because as we get older, we want to become duelists like our favorite characters in the show. Having characters who are the same age does nothing. You could take the duels away from the show and literally nothing would change. This is a light-hearted comedy show that just happens to have dueling in it. This isn’t Yu-Gi-Oh.<br />
<br />
I apologize if this offended anyone who actually enjoys this show but from a diehard fan, this just isn’t worth the time. If I wanted to watch a goofy comedy show, I’d rather watch something else because at least I wouldn’t be disappointed in it being Yu-Gi-Oh.<br />

    Yugioh Sevens is good. I think.<br />
<br />
The Good<br />
<br />
&gt;Humor: This is objectively the funniest Yugioh series to date. The jokes are well-timed and barely ever fall flat. This is the first Yugioh series so far that I&#039;m always looking out fot the latest episode so that I could get some laughs and maybe forget my depression or something. The older series have occasional comic relief, too, but they&#039;re not just as funny as this one.<br />
<br />
&gt;Theme: Strangely enough, Sevens reminds me of 5D&#039;s a lot. I guess it has to do with both series having a similar &quot;theme&quot; overall. This theme about <br />
&quot;changing your destiny&quot;, or something along

          <span style="display: none;" id="review339313">
        those lines. 5D&#039;s is set in Domino City (the &quot;rich&quot; part of the town) and Satellite (the poor part of the town). Citezens of Satellite are forbidden in leaving the place, lest they&#039;d be arrested for doing so. The protagonist, Yusei, is born on Satellite. He built his motorcycle thingy so that he could his fate that brought him to Satellite and go to the City. (I&#039;m gonna cut this here to avoid spoilers.)<br />
<br />
In Sevens, this theme is seen again. Goha City, where the anime is set, is controlled by this large, illuminati-like company called &#039;Goha corporation&quot;, where this company controls almost every aspect of the Goha citizen&#039;s lives. They have drones everywhere patrolling the streets. Apparently they can control the spread of information as well, when they deleted every webpage on the internet mentioning anything related to Rush Duels. It&#039;s almost like a dystopian society, 1984-style. The show as a whole has a friendly, cartoonish atmosphere however. Yuuga, our protagonist, didn&#039;t like that, so he created these new Rush Duels. (Watch the show to learn more.) This anime almost feels like satire, if it isn&#039;t one already.<br />
<br />
tl;dr 5D&#039;s - Poor people living in the slums vs the limits that their own fates had set them<br />
Sevens - A bunch of kids vs an evil corporation that controls every aspect of their city and their lives.<br />
<br />
&gt;Characters: The characters all have their distinct and sometimes contrasting personalities that resulted in some amusing interactions in the series so far. I don&#039;t wanna give out spoilers so I&#039;ll cut this here.<br />
<br />
&gt;Music: The opening and ending songs are total bangers. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX. NANANANANANA. okay i get it you&#039;re catchy please get out of my head i&#039;m trying to sleep<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
<br />
&gt;Rush Duels: Okay, let me get this straight. I&#039;m not a fan of Rush Duels. They make the Dynamax mechanic of the recent Pokemon games seem balanced in comparison. Being able to +5 every turn is really really powerful. Pot of Greed makes you +1 and that card has been banned for years and will probably never return. Also, the duels in the anime so far are... really simple. Okay, nothing wrong with that, but I miss the big brain plays protags like Yusei and Yusaku used to make.<br />
<br />
Other<br />
A lot of people pointed out the art reminds them more of Beyblade, etc rather than a Yugioh anime. I don&#039;t really mind the art, as long as their bodies aren&#039;t disproportioned or something. <br />
The art is fine. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s particularly good or bad and I have nothing to say about it. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I think people were a bit too mean with this show simply because the art style feels differentt. It has themes which I think is reminiscent of 5D&#039;s, my favorite Yugioh series thus far. The characters are promising. I&#039;m excited to see how they grow. (I&#039;m looking at you, Rumin. Please don&#039;t be another benchwarmer like the other Yugioh lead girls.) <br />
I have high hopes for you Sevens. Please don&#039;t disappoint me.<br />
<br />

    TLDR: This is the most criminally under-rated show on MAL. I&#039;ve never written a review on MAL before but in this case, I felt compelled to as this show deserves a much higher score. <br />
<br />
When I saw the (as of writing) 5.84 rating that this show was given by MAL users, I was ready to write it off as I had made the assumption that anything less than a 7 would be a waste of my time. But on a whim, I decided to check out the first episode as I grew up watching and playing Yu Gi Oh (we took our duels VERY seriously...)

          <span style="display: none;" id="review347802">
        and I occasionally miss it so I like to see what&#039;s new. <br />
<br />
As per the MAL rating, I came into the first episode with low expectations but in the end, I was utterly blown away. Long story short, this show is FUN. It has my favourite OP this side of Bloody Stream and the cast is incredibly likable (especially Rook who is 50% edgy, 50% extremely goofy. He&#039;s the best). This is easily the funniest Yu Gi Oh series and I&#039;ve found myself laughing in every episode so far. The main character Yuga is also very likable and is my favourite Yu Gi Oh protagonist since Yusei from 5Ds. I&#039;m so happy to be able to say all this because I had thought that the Yu Gi Oh series would be all down hill from 5Ds. <br />
<br />
But the main thing I want to discuss in this review isn&#039;t why this show is so good but why, in spite of its quality, its MAL rating is so low. I think it ultimately comes down to the changes this show makes from Yu Gi Oh series prior. There are new rules, there&#039;s a new art style and the main cast are younger than ever. Changes like this are bound to evoke ire from long term fans of the series who don&#039;t want to see major changes to their beloved franchise and so associate the changes with a decline in quality. The new rules are really fun and take the game back to basics (without feeling overly simple like Duel Links). As you can now draw cards until you have 5 during your draw phase, comebacks feel way more plausible and less like an asspull. I think the art still looks nice and the character designs are great. The only problem is the CGI monsters but this has quickly grown on me and doesn&#039;t bother me anymore. Though the main cast are around 11 years old, the show is not at all alienating to an older audience, and the age of the characters doesn&#039;t really matter as the show could have been set in High School and still be the same. <br />
<br />
To conclude, this is my favourite show at the moment and I hope that the low MAL rating doesn&#039;t dissuade you from giving it a go like it almost did to me. The creators are clearly very passionate and their passion is infectious. As soon as the new cards are released, I will say goodbye to my family and make my return to duelling. What could be higher praise for a Yu Gi Oh show than that?

    December 20th, 2019:<br />
<br />
After another 3 year era of a Yu-Gi-Oh! entry behind us, we sat down - food and drinks in hand - alongside our loved ones. We speculated, expressed our excitement, and laughed in honor of the announcement that would mark the next step of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise that we all know and loved. This one was special, however, as the recent Yu-Gi-Oh! anime - Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS - was cut short, leaving the only fathomable reason to be for the sake of the next entry.<br />
<br />
Finally, after many hours, no, 2-3 patient months, the livestream began and we got our first glimpse at the new

          <span style="display: none;" id="review338557">
        7th Yu-Gi-Oh! anime... Little did anyone expect, this singular glimpse would shake the Yu-Gi-Oh! community&#039;s very core; moments before 2020 subjected its jaw dropping events onto the world.<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS is by far the most drastic away from form in the history of the franchise. Needless to say, a lot of pessimism was directed toward the announcement. Change is a tricky beast and its nature easily births audience apprehension, especially on hardcore anime and official card game fans. However, we can only forge so many opinions before the official airing; on paper tends to pan out much differently into execution, so how did Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS pan out? Judging by my score, you can probably already guess my thoughts on it and I can only provide context to both longtime fans and potential new viewers contemplating spending their time with this product. And with Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS filling the void of 2020 anime hiatus, now&#039;s the best time to gather our thoughts regarding this entry! Here we go...<br />
<br />
Few things to note:<br />
<br />
I will be bringing up comparisons between SEVENS and the previous entry, Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, as some of my thoughts stems from its aftermath. Most importantly though, I want to judge Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS on its own merit since while comparisons can be useful tools for understanding, they can downplay one&#039;s view of the product by muddying it with biases, which in my opinion is unfair to the product at hand attempting to stand on its own.<br />
<br />
Story - 6:<br />
<br />
The story of Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS is pretty simple. A elementary school boy named Yuga Ohda believes that his home, Goha City, has rules that are far too rigid for anyone to have fun dueling. Rebelling against this, Yuga creates a new style of dueling called &quot;Rush Duels&quot; portraying the complete opposite of the controlling and tight rules wrapped around Goha City&#039;s neck by the Goha Corporation. Now, Yuga and his group of friends work to make Rush Dueling a national sensation that&#039;ll hopefully break the rigid system placed upon his city.<br />
<br />
A fairly simple synopsis, but an interesting premise. The world of Goha City&#039;s clearly a dictatorship where EVERYTHING&#039;S being governed and controlled. From school, daily life, daily necessities, and of course, duels. Although we haven&#039;t seen all these elements in actions since we&#039;re only 5 episodes in - most of which were focused on introducing our cast - you do see some of it at play. For example, kids can&#039;t even trade cards without Goha Corporation&#039;s supervision... Let me repeat, YOU CAN&#039;T TRADE CARDS WITHOUT GOHA CORPORATION&#039;S SUPERVISION! This is a TRADING card game mind you and while a corporation does control the management of the actual card game, it&#039;s never on a personal extent like this. Furthermore, everyone&#039;s duel disks are run by accounts and if you get enough penalties, your account will be deleted thus preventing you from ever dueling again and guess who runs it: Goha Corporation. They can even go as far as deactivating the duel disk whenever they want, so already we can see what Yuga&#039;s talking about when he says these rules are rigid in the dueling scene.<br />
<br />
With Rush Duel&#039;s existence, it&#039;ll be interesting to see what Goha Corporation will do and what Yuga&#039;ll do in return as the battle between them - currently nothing but a small scuffle - escalate into a full blown conflict.<br />
<br />
Oh, and um, what are &quot;Rush Duels&quot; you ask? Remember Speed Duels? They&#039;re like that except... SCREW THE RULES:<br />
<br />
1. You can Normal Summon as many times as you want.<br />
<br />
2. During your Draw Phase, you draw until you have 5 cards in hand instead of only drawing 1 (unless you have 5 cards in hand already).<br />
<br />
3. There&#039;s no Main Phase 2.<br />
<br />
4. Rush Duels have their own card pool separate from the actual TCG/OCG.<br />
<br />
5. The field has 3 main monster zones and 3 spell/trap card zones.<br />
<br />
If you want to know more, look it up, but you can see how &quot;free&quot; this duel format is, ha ha! It does look fun though. The Yu-Gi-Oh! anime always has a knack at making otherwise weak material so inspiringly fun! I&#039;d love to try Rush Duels one day and I hope people gives it a chance instead of leaving it behind on paper.<br />
<br />
The reason I gave the story a 6 though is because we&#039;re still in the building stages of the anime. As I said prior, most of the episodes were dedicated on introducing our cast, and additionally, subtle world building; so the story hasn&#039;t really progressed after the first episode - or at least not drastically - but the elements placed so far can be exploited for many intriguing directions. This has the potential to be great if the writers play their cards right... Pun unintended. ;o<br />
<br />
Art - 7:<br />
<br />
This was where almost the entire controversy surrounding Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS stemmed from: the complete artstyle change. Personally, I was one of the few who didn&#039;t have a problem with it. In fact, although overall generic, I like the new artstyle. I find it bright, fun, and it brings out a lot of character (speak of the devil considering what section&#039;s coming up). DON&#039;T GET ME WRONG THOUGH! Like everyone else, I prefer the OG artstyle. The iconic Yu-Gi-Oh! artstyle was sharp, had a lot of detail that brought numerous memorable expressions, and of course was unique. Despite all that though, I can&#039;t hate this artstyle because it&#039;s not even bad to me.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it&#039;s because I don&#039;t have that strong of an attachment to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, so the change doesn&#039;t affect me on a personal level as it does other people who&#039;ve been with this franchise for years... Or maybe I&#039;m just very tolerant; it is what it is. 🤷 <br />
<br />
One thing I&#039;ll say though is that the art quality can be inconsistent at times. Like the recent episode had some, to put it nicely, weird shots here and there personally. Plus, the animation can be a bit stiff at times. It&#039;s only sometimes though; look at episode 1 and 3 for the best shots and animation you&#039;ll ever see from this anime!<br />
<br />
Sound - 6:<br />
<br />
...Honestly, I don&#039;t even remember most of the tracks in SEVENS. Yuga&#039;s theme is flames though (I want a copy of this so bad) and the opening&#039;s catchy.<br />
<br />
Character - 9:<br />
<br />
The section I&#039;ve been looking forward to, hoo boy!<br />
<br />
THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT! I love the main cast&#039;s dynamic with each other and they exude so much energy that it always brings a smile on my face! And despite being younger than me, I can somewhat relate to them and understand them for the most part, so that&#039;s nice! I also like how the characters interact with the world, using social media to advertise Rush Duels for example. It&#039;s an easy relatable feature showcasing the knowledge of the young and how tuned they are to modern technology, and the anime always does those interactions in both clever and funny ways.<br />
<br />
Now&#039;s the best time to start bringing up the VRAINS comparisons. I did plan on making a VRAINS review as well... but I accidentally X&#039;d out of the page where I wrote it and didn&#039;t feel like rewriting it all (trust me, IT WAS A LOT), so I&#039;ll give a short version of my thoughts now:<br />
<br />
VRAINS was a mixed bag. I still enjoyed it, but the anime had its problems which I couldn&#039;t overlook. One major complaint I have are the characters. They all had great introductions and backstories, but most of them didn&#039;t follow up very well, to the point that a lot of them ended up... stale? There were good ones, definitely (Ai, Takeru, and pretty much all the main villains - Revolver being the best, imo), however there were those who got development but never gained any pay off (Aoi), or were just characters I didn&#039;t find interesting nor good (Yusaku and Go). This is because VRAINS focused way more on the story, which while appreciated, didn&#039;t flesh out the characters required well; they felt more like chess pieces than actual people.<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS&#039; the complete opposite, though. All the characters have engaging personalities and dynamics, making them a breath of fresh air after coming off a no nonsense anime like VRAINS. Characters are created to carry a plot and if they aren&#039;t engaging or interesting, that&#039;s a major hit on the plot itself. VRAINS&#039; characters fortunately were decent enough to keep my interest alongside a genuinely intriguing plot line, but the cast definitely could have used more improvements.<br />
<br />
Oh well. At least I can appreciate SEVENS&#039; cast because of this. On that note, I&#039;ll tell you what I think about each of our main four characters:<br />
<br />
Yuga Ohda: I like him. So far he&#039;s a pretty fun protagonist with admirable determination and motivation. He has the fun-loving, laid-back attitude of Jaden and the brains plus tech savvy nature of Yusei and Yusaku. He&#039;s genuinely a smart kid and has made some cunning moves across the first five episodes, making him much more interesting as a character. It&#039;s also cool he created a freaking whole new dueling format! Get one up&#039;d, Yuya!<br />
<br />
Rook (Tatsuhisa Kamijro) - You wouldn&#039;t think so at first glance, but this dude&#039;s hilarious! Rook&#039;s the highly confidant and self proclaimed &quot;#1 Duelist of Goha 7th Elementary&quot;. He wishes to use Rush Duels to achieve his own large ambitions - larger than Yuga&#039;s I&#039;d argue! Those larger ambitions are... usually used for comedic moments; did I tell you how great the comedy in this entry is, ha ha! Rook&#039;s not merely a joke character either. He puts his money where his mouth is and has an interesting ability which I won&#039;t delve into for the sake of spoilers, but uh... his watch is hella sus. NOT A SPOILER; JUST A PREDICTION!<br />
<br />
Romin Kirishima - The must have Yu-Gi-Oh! heroine of the group. Romin&#039;s a girl with a constant, mysterious aura surrounding her. She claims she&#039;s not interested in dueling, but some signs says otherwise. There&#039;s also other aspects and actions she&#039;s done suggesting she may have a bigger role in the plot, which makes her an interesting character off the bat. Other than the mystery, she&#039;s known for being a guitarist in a band called &quot;Roaromin&quot; who has found much success for herself. Yes, we all know what happens with Yu-Gi-Oh! girls, but remember this is written by a different writing team within a different studio, so there&#039;s a small speck of hope for Romin to shine brighter than her predecessors. We&#039;ll have to wait and see, but she&#039;s so far my favorite character! Her episode&#039;s also my favorite so far.<br />
<br />
Gakuto Sogetsu - The uptight and disciplined student council president of Goha 7th Elementary. Usually these character types try their damnest to stay out of trouble and keep the hero in line before inevitably getting dragged into their shenanigans, which is kinda still true for Gakuto but also not really. Gakuto doesn&#039;t really try that hard to escape Yuga&#039;s shenanigans and seems to genuinely find Rush Duels engaging early on, making him a more fun character and different from his archetype. He&#039;s also really funny! His character&#039;s so dramatic that I can&#039;t help but laugh! He surprisingly became my favorite character after the first episode due to the scenes he stole with his personality and I love it! He has dropped in favoritism for me though since I got to the know the other three better and Gakuto so far hasn&#039;t matched what I thought made him so great in episode 1. Still, he&#039;s so far a pretty good character and not a one note archetype you expect him to be.<br />
<br />
Overall, I seriously love the characters here and am excited to go on this 2-3 year journey with them!<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - 10:<br />
<br />
If it wasn&#039;t obvious, I absolutely love this anime! It has a lot of heart and personality, and genuinely has engaged me throughout all the five episodes using both its characters and duels. I&#039;m all for this ride! ... But of course I&#039;m not stupid.<br />
<br />
I know there&#039;s still a chance for this entry to flop. I originally felt the same way with VRAINS as I found its beginning very strong, intriguing, and different from past Yu-Gi-Oh! entries, but unfortunately, I must say it fell flat on its face one too many times... But nothing will get solved with pessimism. I&#039;ll enjoy this anime for what it is, likely until its ending. It has hooked me so far and has the potential to be something great! <br />
<br />
I know it&#039;s different, but different doesn&#039;t always equal bad.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS thus far is such a treat! The characters are fun, it looks good for the most part, and the story has a lot of potential going for it. There are some flaws. As said, the art and animation can be inconsistent, but only sometimes and doesn&#039;t hinder the experience for me.<br />
<br />
Despite its appearance, this is still Yu-Gi-Oh!, guys - in all its fun-loving glory. I hope anyone reading this will consider giving it a chance. Those who already have, I hope you stick around, and if you don&#039;t, that&#039;s okay; nothing&#039;s made for everyone. <br />
<br />
I can&#039;t wait for SEVENS&#039; return and see the vision Studio Bridge has for this entry!

    Ok, I&#039;m gonna tell everyone who sees this shows score on this sight and give them this piece of advice: DO NOT TAKE THIS SCORE TO HEART. <br />
<br />
This show is probably the funniest and fun Yu-Gi-Oh! series ever, but of course because of it looking different it has been prematurely trashed by the Yu-Gi-Oh! community. <br />
<br />
Aside from the art style not looking like the previous seasons, the characters in this show are also a bit younger as well. That of course causes people to immediately dismiss the show as well, because apparently children can&#039;t be the star in a show aimed towards children about playing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review371829">
        a children&#039;s card game. <br />
<br />
The third reason for this shows unfortunate premature hatred is of course the new formatting, Rush Duels. Now here is what I find to be interesting about this game that is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the main game format, which is: The cards actually have balanced and reasonable effects and costs that counter balance the games insane pacing. No, &quot;I summon this easy to summon monster which lets me summon another monster from my deck and then it can destroy as many cards you control equal to the monsters I have on my side of the field blah blah blah-&quot; these cards are actually have effects that make this game feel like it&#039;s freed itself from the insane OP fest that it&#039;s become over the years. Normal summoning is actually an important part of the game again, both players have a far chance of making a comeback each turn, and you can actually strategize again without having to rely on broken cards. <br />
<br />
Rush Duels can actually make the game fun again without having to use meta decks!  <br />
<br />
Story wise, again it&#039;s a breath of fresh air in comparison to the previous Yu-Gi-Oh! series, in which it doesn&#039;t take itself too seriously. No saving the world with cards games, no one is dying from card games, and no magic BS. <br />
<br />
The show is basically about Yuga Oudo, the protagonist of this series, who feels as though dueling has become restrictive and dull. So in order to make the game feel free and fun again he creates a new kind of dueling, Rush Duels. In this world though, dueling is over seen by the Goha Corporation, who are essentially a giant corporation that have tight grip over dueling and duelist. They can terminate duelist accounts without difficulty and thus preventing them from ever dueling with duel disk ever again. This doesn&#039;t sound like a big deal, but this is Yu-Gi-Oh! after all so dueling means everything to the people of this world. Goha sees Yuga&#039;s Rush Duels as an abomination and are set out in destroying it. <br />
<br />
The story really is a 6 or 7 right now, it&#039;s entertaining and they have had some amazing episodes, but nothing too of the wall in terms of the plot has happened yet. That being said it has been getting more intriguing as it continues. It&#039;s only 30 episodes in, so we still have a good ways to go.<br />
<br />
Please, anyone who is interested in this show, give it a shot. Don&#039;t just watch 3-4 episodes and declare it bad, because have any of the previous ones been great in just a few episodes? Watch it all the way through till the end and decide then, because this show will surprise you.

    When I first saw the opening for Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens, I hated it. I despised it. I vowed to myself I&#039;d never watch it. Twenty four episodes later and I&#039;m very thankful I managed to betray myself; going into it with a very open mind. Let&#039;s first address why I thought I wouldn&#039;t like it.<br />
<br />
The Cast:<br />
Having the creator of sailor moon to design characters didn&#039;t really fit Yu-Gi-Oh! for me, so I initially didn&#039;t like the designs of anyone besides Romin Kirishima. <br />
<br />
The Themes:<br />
Yu-Gi-Oh&#039;s Lighter hearted seasons almost always receive the most backlash, (looking at you Zexal I) and as the audience grows older every generation

          <span style="display: none;" id="review364132">
        they expect some kind of recognition with darker themes, hence why 5Ds is the second highest rating past the original series, it&#039;s the sense of dread and mystery that makes the anime interesting. Yu-Gi-Oh Sevens, up until the most recent episodes, (23-24) had none of that.<br />
<br />
I fell for my own confirmation bias that the entire show would just be washed over and have no flare to it. Whilst the story is mediocre at best thus far, it&#039;s showing promise of developing. Originally, as I stated, I hated the characters. But as the shows first few episodes are episodic to get us used to different characters, the four main cast are now among my favourites. Yuga recently (and I won&#039;t say how) went into a depressive state, and searched an unlikely person to befriend. The character interactions in this are wonderful, they&#039;re fleshed out with reams of personality.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s important to see this anime as more of a comedy, above much else. When you view it that way, rather than going in expecting DM or 5ds 2.0, it&#039;s a lot more enjoyable. Over 24 episodes thus far the cast have grown so much, especially Romin Kirishima, and I&#039;m extremely interested to see more of unlikely allies Mimi Atachi and Roa. <br />
<br />
Overall, if you can stomach a first few episodes with an open mind to let the characters grow on you, you won&#039;t mind the comedy of the series half as much, and you&#039;ll grow to appreciate the themes each character presents.

    At first i was rly sceptical about Yugioh Sevens. I thought this was a bad joke compared to what we had before but as a sworn long time Yugioh fan i wanted to at least try it out.<br />
<br />
So i went in with 0 expectations and too my suprise: it was really fun. I started enjoying it before even realising and for the first time in forever i feel so addicted to a anime that i can barely wait a week for the next episode.<br />
<br />
What overall caught me was propably the unique humour and the feeling of never knowing what comes next. I think we all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review383002">
        learned after ZeXal and Arc-V to never judge a Yugioh series on his first childish loking style, and i see great potential for a good story in this. We didnt get many hints yet what is still to come but they surely let us puzzle out a lot.<br />
<br />
What i also really enjoy is the characters. Most sidecharacters are over the top similar to the first fights in ZeXal and the main characters are very unique. I love how they made Yuuga basically a mix out of Yusei and Yuma which fits suprisingly well. And Luke is at one hand a great comedic relieve and on the other hand has the potential to become a great duelist.<br />
<br />
And i love the system of Rush Duels. I know its debated a lot, some hate it and some love it. But the amount of strategies you can use with this is insane. In a very short amount of time the Duel heats up entirely and you can defeat your opponent in 1 turn if you use the possibilities of rush duels correctly. Its a Duel without any breaks because you cant summon anymore or you dont have hand cards. i think we all know how annoying it can be when both players run out of handcards<br />
<br />
So all in all: give it a try. i see a great future for this showand you shouldnt be too scared by the low ratings from many people. Like i said before, we had that with ZeXal and Arc-V as well ;) they will cool down once the story developes

    watched this far and none of the main cast have grown more than two personality traits. there is not a single likeable character in there. there&#039;s luke who spends 20% of each episode&#039;s screentime being the butt of every single joke, romin who&#039;s doesn&#039;t do anything else besides be the tsukkomi, gakuto who the writers mostly forget about, and our protagonist, who has one personality trait, always reacts in the same way to everything, and is just generally a cardboard cutout telling people to love duels.<br />
<br />
story is boring and full of filler, there are no stakes, the main villains so far have done nothing, we

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382673">
        don&#039;t even know in what way they&#039;re evil, and also they literally have no way of winning. the protagonists beat the villains and solved the plot on the second episode. now they&#039;re just wandering aimlessly into various plots they aren&#039;t invested in<br />
<br />
the duels are bare-bones and skill-less. the only things they&#039;ve done so far are summon monsters, tribute summon monsters, and a few times they get to summon maximum monsters only for the plot to then eat those monsters immediately afterward.<br />
<br />
the humor is tedious as fuck. most of it is tsukkomi routines more forced than being hit in the head fifty times with a baseball bat. every time they come up with a remotely funny joke, they have to reuse it at least 3 times more.<br />
<br />
guys, yugioh is more than this.

    First of, if the newest anime of an entire series is different to its predecestors, it doesnt mean its bad, but lots fans will mostlikely downvote it just because its different<br />
<br />
and after that note, i rate yu gi oh sevens as mostlikely one of the better yu gi oh&#039;s around, But i dont recommend it as the first, second or even third series to watch.<br />
<br />
soo to the point, why do i like it? Simple, its because its fun. no high stakes, no huge villans, characters playing the card game for fun and not for Saving thousands of people/souls/worlds?.. and thats... the main reason why do

          <span style="display: none;" id="review412599">
        i like sevens, because its a great break from unnecesarly huge stakes that ruin the experience.<br />
<br />
Soo starting with story (soo some spoilers ahead)<br />
Like i said, it doesnt have unnecesarly huge stakes, soo far the most stakes were about Deleting the Rush duel mode which the protagonist yuuga created because he wanted to have more fun playing the game.. and they succeded just for the mode to get instaled back once again. Will the world end? will everyone die? Absouletly not, but soo far its still fun and engaging.<br />
<br />
With characters they&#039;re ok, but they got lots of space for deveelopment and soo far they used quite a lot of it pretty well Even for some side characters, &quot;villans&quot; aand it still doesnt look like they will ruin the character of the main heroine(which happened alot in.. like most of the older series) <br />
Main cast is fun to watch<br />
the side cast are also pretty ok<br />
even villans soo far were fun to watch<br />
<br />
Soo... the most important part of every yu gi oh series, how duels are written.<br />
soo far... i like them, they&#039;re fun, constant back and forth, we can get surprised alot and whats pretty important, they are much harder to predict compared to the previous series, and thats what lower stakes allows sevens to do. Lesser stakes makes it possible for everyone to have more character developmeent, battles are less perdictable, and you can still see great, fun duels..<br />
Also the fact that characters draw up 5 cards instead of 1 each turn makes it less possible for stupid &quot;i drew that 1 specific card that sucks but in this ultra specific situation is amazing&quot; situations... actualy Yuuga managed to pull something like that off and still lost soo that was a nice surprise.<br />
<br />
Soo to end the review: Fun yugioh, great break from the trainwreck that was arc-v and kinda disapoiting vrains.

    This is so underrated here... just give it an opportunty. <br />
<br />
Maybe rush duels are not so deep, but the characters are funny and the story is getting better, the art is ok anyways I prefer old style and old monsters. <br />
<br />
I tihink the anime needs better villains, anyways most part is comedy for now, so I don´t care.<br />
<br />
The main characters and their friends are nice and they are getting better duels too.<br />
 <br />
The ost is great, but I would like new opening/ending soon.<br />
<br />
Just watch this if you are a general yugioh fan or you don´t know what to watch this season.<br />
If you are new to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review385641">
        yugi better start with older seasons, those are great too.

    Yu-Gi-Oh Sevens is mediocre. Everything about it is mediocre, except story which barely exist at this point. Although it seems to actually be starting at this point.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
Yuuga: Yuuga is a pure heart good boy shonen protagonist who wants everyone to smile and things Master Duels or Goha Duels as the show calls them have become stale, although its never explained way and so he invents Rush Duels. And he is by far in my opinion the most boring Yugioh protagonist by far. Also he&#039;s super smart and just knows stuff and it&#039;s never explain how he worked it out. <br />
<br />
Rook: Rook is probably the main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393024">
        character with the most potential to grow, he also my least favourite of them. He&#039;s rather up himself, but not in a fun amusing way. Generally I think he&#039;s character you either like or dislike. <br />
<br />
Romin: The main female character and rather a good character, or at least for the show she&#039;s entertaining enough, her duels are the most entertaining in the show also she uses psychic monsters and will give praise to any main character who doesn&#039;t use Spellcaster, Dragons or Warriors. Her growth so far has been the best of the main characters . <br />
<br />
Gokuto: I love Gokuto he is great, he&#039;s the student council president and a rather serious character at least compared to Yuuga and Rook. He&#039;s works well enough as character. I just like serious characters. <br />
<br />
Roa: Roa has the personality of a rival, although I don&#039;t think he&#039;s technically the rival, but he&#039;s great and needs to appear more, his similar to Rook but nowhere near annoying.<br />
<br />
Otes: Otes is the most interesting thing about Sevens by far, the person who  inspired Yuuga, he&#039;s mysterious and interesting and let&#039;s be real probably the only reason I continuing to watch this show.<br />
<br />
Sebestian: Sebestian is the only character in this show who is actually funny.   <br />
<br />
Rush Duels: The biggest difference between this series and the others. and there fine, like everything else. Basically the original Yu-Gi-Oh but much faster, but I&#039;m going to be honest the thing I like most about the original is the characters not the dueling (Expcet Duelist Kingdom, because that stuff was crazy and bonkers).<br />
<br />
Rush Duels are my biggest problem but not how you think, the game is fine but how it is treated is not. Basically you cannot dislike Rush Duels. IF you don&#039;t like Rush Duels you are antagonistic and have never played Rush Duels   and once you play you will love Rush Duels and Yuuga forever. Also you can&#039;t dislike Yuuga, like everyone seems to have just have absolute faith in him. <br />
<br />
Like true you shouldn&#039;t judge something before you try it, but just because you try it doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll like it, and the show actively seems afraid to make a character who doesn&#039;t like Rush Duels or Yuuga or is even neutral on them. And I think a character like that would go a long way. <br />
