overDress is a reboot of the Cardfight!! Vanguard franchise, something I&#039;ve not been following for as long as some, but still for the past two or so years. I was looking for a new card game to get into, anime&#039;s a good gateway, and watching the original anime got it to stick. The original Cardfight!! Vanguard anime is by no means a great show, but the beginning served as a compelling enough hook to get people into the game. The characters were ok and the structure scratched a similar itch to the one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review395448">
        that Beyblade did, where you could throw yourself into this dumb little fantasy where people actually care that you&#039;re good at card games or battle tops or whatever. Big tournaments, rivals and friends, etc. And they were ads, no doubt. But because of that they actually focused on the subject, that being cards.<br />
<br />
overDress isn&#039;t really about the card game. That might be ok if it were about something else, but so far? No dice. The first two episodes consisted of a slew of low rent gay jokes followed by some of the most confusing card games ever put to animation, card games that will leave you with more questions than answers. Questions like: &quot;Wait, how did Megumi manifest all those rearguards? They weren&#039;t there a two-second cut-shot ago and she still has the same number of cards in hand.&quot; or &quot;Wait, why did Bastion only get one drive check?&quot; It was almost excusable when the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime didn&#039;t know the rules to their own game, but Vanguard&#039;s been around for a full decade now. People who know the game are gonna be baffled; people who don&#039;t are gonna be given the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
But again, this is Vanguard trying to be less of an advert and more of a &quot;real anime&quot;. So how&#039;s it faring?<br />
<br />
Well, it definitely &quot;looks&quot; better. CLAMP&#039;s character designs are nice and the sakuga animation of the Bruce-Bastion fight at the end of episode 1 looked genuinely great. Beyond that? Hoo boy, it&#039;s rocky. I&#039;ll say that Danji has a bit of charm as far as characters go, though it&#039;d be hyperbolic to call him magnetic. He&#039;s a fun dude, secure and confident in himself, and a good role model. Yu-yu is Aichi but somehow an even bigger pushover, Megumi&#039;s an airhead who calls Danji &quot;onii-chan&quot; even though she clearly wants to Cardfight and Chill (they aren&#039;t actually related, it&#039;s cooooooooooooooool), Touya has all of two minutes to make an impression and uh fails, and Tomari plays hot cops because she is literally a hot cop. In episode 1, a random street predator gets more time and development than either Touya or Tomari simply by harassing a crossdressing Yu-yu on I believe 4 separate occasions. This seems to already be a recurring theme as far as &quot;haha guy wants to bang Yu-yu BUT YU-YU IS A BOY LMAO&quot; goes, the entire second episode built around Megumi thinking Danji wants to bang Yu-yu. Also pretty sure Danji&#039;s in his 20s and Yu-yu seems like he&#039;s 13-14 but ok. The same gay joke is beaten like a dead horse once again for 10-15 minutes before we end the show with another rushed card game with wildly poor direction.<br />
<br />
The third episode was probably the strongest, though that isn&#039;t saying much. It does an okay job of showing Yu-yu&#039;s empathetic intuition when he&#039;s working with Danji (meant to be his &quot;it&quot; factor that draws Danji to him) and it features two card games. Both are messy and make little sense, but they lean into it better than the first two episodes did and we get some more sakuga animation and a serviceable cliffhanger. Of course, episode four capitalizes on none of it. There&#039;s not a single card game in this episode of a card game anime, which, again, would be okay, if the episode was &quot;plot heavy&quot;. But beyond a quickly resolved misunderstanding meant to vaguely introduce the audience to a friend of Danji&#039;s, nothing happens. It&#039;s borderline filler content in a 12-episode original series. Not sure how you go about defending that.<br />
<br />
Point is, yeah, overDress sure is more like a &quot;real anime&quot;, but in a lot of those creepy, low brow, mildly offensive ways that make you hurry to explain &quot;it&#039;s not all like this&quot;. As of now, it fails as a card game advert and it fails as a show that can stand on its own two legs. I&#039;m still excited for the rebooted game itself: that feels like a true improvement over past iterations. But I&#039;m trying to not let my excitement for the game itself trick me into thinking this show is good. Things can always change and my masochistic ass will likely follow this for a while (I&#039;ve endured worse), but right now, it&#039;s bad. Like, really damn bad.

    To keep things short: Vanguard overDress is a breath of fresh air injected in a considerably old franchise.<br />
<br />
As someone who watched and loved the first series back in 2011, and tried some of the subsequent ones, it was really nice to see overDress not following the same old formula. There is no first episode explaining the rules, there is no old characters making cameos, it is all new and it is all different.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference between this and the older animes (&quot;If&quot; may be an exception here), is that it is not a story ABOUT Vanguard told USING Vanguard. It is a story about these

          <span style="display: none;" id="review404655">
        characters and how they grow as people, and they play Vanguard in the process.<br />
They basically take all the SoL aspects of the other animes (which are arguably the best part about these for me) and do not rush them in 10 minutes per episode so they can fit a rushed fight in the other half. It is much easier to connect and enjoy their stories beacause of this.<br />
<br />
You are free to disagree, of course. But at least give them credit for trying. In a industry where it&#039;s really easy to just sit and repeat what made success, they took a step froward and tried to reinvent themselves.<br />
<br />
Regarding the more technical aspects, the anime is pretty decent. With great visuals, specially in the short battle scenes with the &quot;avatars&quot;, nice voice acting complementing fun and enjoyable characters, and a decent soundtrack.<br />
<br />
Now we have to wait for the next season, which will probably finish the story and allow us to be able to give it a fair analysis.

    A new series of Vanguard is here! Being a fan of Vanguard for many years, to hear a new series was coming this season, I was super happy about it. While I am pleased in some areas in what this anime is bringing with it&#039;s new story, and new adventure. It isn&#039;t perfect by any means. But for sure, as a long term Vanguard fan, it&#039;s just real nice to have another Vanguard show around once more.<br />
<br />
Story and characters<br />
For me. While Vanguard is about the card game, but Vanguard has always had either a good cast of characters, with personalities that really drive the show

          <span style="display: none;" id="review393978">
        forward, or a good enough cast that can do that. As if even if the card game didn&#039;t exist. I&#039;d still enjoy the anime just because of the cast members. As for how the story is in this? Well we have Yu-yu, who can come off as how Aichi was when he first started, but has a little more confidence about him. A nice and timid boy, with three older sisters who just loves to tease him. Through shenanigans, he ends up being saved by Danji, Megumi and other members of a Vanguard circle, which thus leads him to knowing and learning about Vanguard. From there, we learn more about the characters, along with the place that visit to play Vanguard, which looks like a groups private hideout, just to have fun, chill and play card games. It&#039;s real nice. Which so far is the basis of the show, and I can&#039;t really complain. Have fun playing card games. What&#039;s more to love? It might not be perfect, and there are things that could be better for sure, As this doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s a more serious driven based story outside of using so many misunderstands, or just focusing more on just having fun side of things for now. But it&#039;s still fairly decent.<br />
<br />
As for how the characters are? Danji seems like a rad dude with a good head on his shoulders. Great at Vanguard, and passionate on things he&#039;s into. Megumi is sweet, passionate also, which is lovely to see. I could say all characters are super passionate about Vanguard, and don&#039;t shy away from it.<br />
<br />
Art and music<br />
The art is like the Vanguard of old, but more brighter, and the colours really stand out more. But there are some other details too. Like the back of the cards is really cool, and as per usual, the art designs of the cards themselves, it&#039;s top notch far as I am concerned. Something that I really admire when it comes to card shows, just some of the art on the cards, really incredible stuff. I also love how they transition into the battles, and how good they look there, it feels like an epic battle of the Vanguards going at it. Only issue is, that it&#039;s only near the end really.<br />
<br />
The music and sounds throughout the show is good. The tone that goes on through the battles is good stuff. Can&#039;t go wrong there, while the the tone throughout the show is good too. Simple, effect, and good.<br />
<br />
My only real complaint so far, is that certain jokes might be overused, and the card games can sometimes look super fast. Though that could just be the start, as this show could be establishing cast members first before going all out with those fights and how important they are to the story later on, so we&#039;ll wait and see, and who knows how it&#039;ll end up like. But so far OverDress has been a blast for me personally. You won&#039;t regret watching it.

    !!! CAREFUL SOME SPOILERS !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanguard OverDress is a reboot/relaunch of the long running Cardfight Vanguard franchise and now that its first cour has run its course I can safely say I can see where they’re going while also having no idea who this series is for.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
<br />
The story starts with Yuyu, a young teen who is a bit of a pushover who gets introduced to the world of Vanguard and joins a team that meets up in an abandoned amusement park near his town. On the surface its about how Yuyu grows more confident and learns to stand up for himself with the advice and help

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406783">
        of his new friends and Vanguard but I am not 100% sure if that is actually what the story is about.<br />
<br />
That is largely due the structure and pacing of the story. The first episode introduces us to most of the main characters and while it doesn’t tell us a lot about the cardgame, the amazing animation symbolizing the fight is breathtaking and draws you in. The subsequent episodes continue the narrative, yes, but in the way that they happen chronologically but the events never affecting the story or characters in the long term. The episodes include highlights such as “Megumi thinks Danji is gay for Yuyu”, “Danji wrestles a real life Japanese wrestler” and “Yuyu is sick and sleeps over at Danji’s”. Most of them reveal minor details about the characters and their relationships but overall feel more like time fillers than anything. <br />
<br />
It’s only halfway through the series where the story finally starts to show itself but it is promptly dropped for a while before being picked up again and rushed through in the last three episodes. Perhaps because the series spend half of its runtime not having a story at all, the stakes for the climax are only set in episode 10 with the story completely losing its grounded tone of just a bunch of friends hanging out and playing cardgames and instead jumping headfirst into the overly serious and dramatic tone of its contemporaries which is jarring for a series that so far tried to be about anything except cardgames.<br />
<br />
Which is another point that bothers me about OverDress: It is not about Vanguard. It doesn’t even really involve Vanguard. Yes, the game is the reason why Yuyu joins the group but beyond that it has little to do with the actual happenings of the story, they could be playing Bop-It instead for all the impact it had on the story. The characters don’t establish what’s fun about the game or even what they personally like about it, instead just repeating that it’s fun like a broken record with the viewer having no idea why it would be. The series seems to be so disinterested in the cardgame itself that the first half omits entire sections of a fight or even has episodes where you don’t see a Vanguard field at all. The second half is better about it and sometimes even shows whole cardfights with no cuts but because the viewer is never told the rules about it will probably leave many who didn’t watch the previous seasons or play the game themselves confused.<br />
<br />
There are many factors that could have let to the, in my opinion, lackluster story structure from the director being new to series directing and Vanguard in general to the attempts at being a “serious” anime going a bit too far to the series being planned with 24 episodes and being paced as such despite the split. Whatever those reasons are, I don’t find the story particularly engaging and having to wait 10 episodes for something resembling a plot to appear is a big ask. 4/10<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
<br />
One of the upsides of this anime. There is a reason Clamp has stood the test of time and their character designs are appealing and probably the best part. That’s not to say that Kinema Citrus is slacking off because the rare moments during cardfights where the feeling actually fighting is illustrated with gorgeously animated sequences of the units physically fighting each other. Outside of these scenes the animation is standard but by no means bad with occasionally surreal directing giving some sequences (mostly cardfights) a dream like feeling to them.<br />
<br />
Speaking of directing though, the composition and directing the actual cardfights is notably weak, the first half in particular. Besides just skipping phases and sections of the fights, cards sometimes just appear out of nowhere between frames, characters get damaged as the plot demands, the strategies used are flat and uninteresting etc etc. The last part could be in part because the rebooted game the anime is based around very simple as of the time of writing but even though some of the characters’ decks have built in counters to other decks that is hardly utilized within the series. There is one active attempt at a counter made as far as I remember but besides that most fights boil down to the characters brute forcing their way to victory and drawing the exact card they need at the right time. <br />
<br />
Overall the actual art, animation and direction is fine to good but if you’re a fan of the cardgame and are hoping for fun and exciting fans, you might be disappointed. Because it’s such a niche thing to be bothered about though, I won’t weigh it too much in my score. 8/10<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
<br />
It’s good. I’m not sure what else to say really cause that’s what it is. <br />
<br />
Opening and endings are performed by Roselia and Argonavis from Bushiroad’s “BanG Dream!” franchise and while I have no interest in it I have to admit that the songs that have been used in Vanguard so far are absolute bangers. (heheh)<br />
<br />
I don’t believe the actual OST has been released but from what I heard in the series it gets the job done. It’s appropriately silly, serious and soothing when it needs to be but it never quite stands out on it’s own. It might not stick in your mind but its perfectly serviceable. 8/10<br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
<br />
Oh boy let’s get into this.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters are fine, serviceable, largely inoffensive but they are also kind of boring in a way.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the main protagonist Yuyu. He is mostly a pushover and is mostly dragged around by others, most notably his family and Danji with not a lot of moments where he shows any agency. While the story tells us he becomes more confident as a result of his new hobby and friends, it is not shown very often with Yuyu still being pushed around by the end of the series, if not to the degree as the first episode. He does become more outspoken when it concerns Vanguard with him standing up for his friends in the second to last episode and being less of a nervous wreck but he doesn’t change a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Next is Megumi who I guess you could call the POV character next to Yuyu. She is probably the character we know the most about in the series with several episodes either dedicated to her background or at least tying into it. Despite having so much focus though she doesn’t seem to have a lot of stuff going on for her. She certainly has personality, being friendly if stubborn and often jumping to conclusions but beyond being friends with Yuyu and having an obvious crush on Danji she hasn’t really contributed to the story a lot. Unlike Yuyu there is no clear character arc for her so far and she doesn’t change by the end of the series except for maybe being a bit less clingy towards Danji. It’s possible that there is more planned for her in the second half but as it stands not a lot going on.<br />
<br />
Next is Danji, the arguable deuteragonist of the series. Danji is one of the older guys in the group and the leader of their Vanguard team and while he kinda stupid is a very self-assured and confident person. Despite being an overall friendly guy we don’t know a whole lot about him, only that he is friends with Megumi’s older brother, lives in a dump of a place and does odd jobs around town. It’s implied he has a dark troubled past, sometimes disappearing for days on end and meeting mysterious people behind the scenes. On paper he seems like an interesting character, a good contrast to the shy and introverted Yuyu but the way he’s executed is a bit of a problem. His antics and odd jobs while intended to be humorous often come across as plain weird at best and grinding the story to a literal halt at worst. <br />
<br />
It doesn’t help that the series seems to try really hard to ship Danji with Yuyu with the two of them often blushing around each other and Danji often acting like he’s courting Yuyu and even impressing and meeting his family out of nowhere to “get to know them if they’re going to spend more time together from now on”. Need I remind you that Yuyu is 15 years old and Danji, while we don’t know how old he is exactly, is confirmed to be an adult man. Even if we give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he’s around 19 like Tohya and Zakusa, it’s still kinda weird and I prefer if the series just stopped doing gay jokes about them.<br />
<br />
Last is Tohya. Oh? You didn’t know Tohya was a main character? Well I don’t think the writers did either because despite featuring quite heavily in the opening and appearing at the end of episode 1, Tohya only features in 4 of the 12 episodes, getting properly introduced in episode 6 to the disappear until episode 10. <br />
<br />
To be fair, we do learn quite a lot about him when he’s actually onscreen, he is an academic prodigy with his whole life laid out before him and many expectations put on him by his family and teachers with Vanguard being his only outlet to have fun. He is obviously conflicted about his love for the game and his obligations to his family and he is the only character who I actually buy liking the game. His only goal is to win against Danji once and then quit playing but after losing to Yuyu becomes obsessed with wining to the point of, let me check my notes… becoming an antagonist with no regard for the human cost. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it kinda comes out of the blue with only minor scenes in previous episodes implying that anything is going on with him at all. It’s heavily hinted he is being manipulated by the true antagonists and by the end of the series Danji beats some sense into him but there is not a lot of resolution for his arc whatever it was about. Don’t get too obsessed with winning? Don’t take the game too seriously? But all the other characters take it seriously too, some even acting like someone died because their banner gets burned so what degree of seriousness is good and what is bad? I have no idea what his arc was about but either way it wasn’t good.<br />
<br />
Besides the main characters most of the supporting cast is very one note and gimmicky. Tomari is a cop but also likes to pretend she’s a wrestling announcer during cardfights. Zakusa is an artist but also kind of feral. Yuyu’s family is absolutely terrible. They work and don’t become too grating but they also clash against the more serious last few episodes.<br />
<br />
Overall the characters have potential but they range from not having a lot going on to dear god what were they thinking. 4/10<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
<br />
Not fun. That might be because I’m a fan of the cardgame and as I already noted Vanguard doesn’t really play much of a part or even appear much in this series but I didn’t have a lot of fun, no.<br />
<br />
Even ignoring the lack of cardfights and focusing just on story and characters I can’t say I enjoyed the experience. While I find Yuyu cute and enjoy characters like Megumi, Tomari and Tohya, I really couldn’t stand Danji and his antics. Considering a lot of the show being about Danji however I couldn’t enjoy large parts of it by proxy. The episodes I liked the most were the ones where he just didn’t appear or play a big role but those tended to not drive the plot forward so it was a bit of a double edged sword. 3/10<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
For my overall score, I have to take a step back for a second. I’m obviously biased in my opinion. I got into Vanguard in 2015 right in the Vanguard G era which I argue is overall the best Cardgame anime of all time (I don’t take criticism 5Ds fans). I enjoy the fights, the nitty gritty strategising, the deck building and figuring out ways to counter an opponent with the tools available. I’m really into Vanguard the cardgame and not just Vanguard the anime which makes it obvious I wouldn’t like a show that didn’t focus on it.<br />
<br />
Still, I don’t think my opinion should be dismissed because of it. If you’ve read this far and think I’m someone who’s just salty that a show they liked changed then you’ve obviously not actually absorbed the things I’ve written. While I am a Vanguard fan, I’m an anime and fan of stories first and I think I’ve made my case elaborating the problems I have with this show.<br />
<br />
I don’t know who this show is even for, really. Vanguard fans will be put off by the first 5 episodes seemingly not caring about the game while new viewers are probably put off by the later episodes focusing on a game that was never explained to them. If you remove the cardgame aspect of the show though the show has nothing to stand out while still leaving a lackluster story with poor pacing and characters that are likeable but not remarkable.<br />
<br />
And that’s the most I can really say about this series overall. Not remarkable. There is nothing here you can’t get in other better shows. If you want to watch a show about a shy character learning to become more confident with the power of friendship then you can choose any of the coming of age anime out there. If you want an actual cardgame anime, you also have your pick though I reiterate that Vanguard G is the best one out there.<br />
<br />
If you want both of those? Well, maybe try watching the original Vanguard or even the 2018 reboot. You will have a much better time than with this show. 4/10

    NO SPOILERS<br />
<br />
Ok, this is the best anime about a card game I&#039;ve ever watched.<br />
Focusing on the characters and in a more realistic world instead of the game itself was a great option due to the better plot development and, eventhough it doesn&#039;t necessarily explain the rules or anything, that&#039;s not a failure! It really got me into Vanguard. The direction/production is so amazing by making those metaphysical representations of sakuga during the duels. It doesn&#039;t seem artificial or too ilogic like other card game series. The characters are so likable, the protagonist is very good (he&#039;s a mix of Aladdin and Deku) and the screen

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411037">
        time is only more focused on Danji because of character arcs, I got a feeling that Yu-Yu will be the main focused in the next seasons (or even in the final season by showing his full potential at work, and that would be amazing). The series is a comedy gold, it&#039;s fun and balance the serious moments with the fun moments very well. And of course, the soundtrack is pretty decent (the opening itself is not a masterpiece of a music but it&#039;s visually very intense).<br />
Overall, I&#039;m super excited for the next seasos and I hope it doesn&#039;t lose all of its quality through time. Definitely recommend.

    I am a big fan of the original vg series and have played the physical card game before, I plan on coming back to playing the game to when the overdress reboot was announced. So even though I really really love what I see in the tcg right now and I feel like the new format is heading the right direction, the overdress anime to me is.....  very disappointing. For a card game anime it doesn&#039;t really have that much card games shown to it, they focus on Danji way too much (actually feels like Danji has more screen time than yuyu, you know,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396886">
        the protagonist), it&#039;s very slice of life which is kinda cute i guess but when I watch a card game anime i actually want to see the card game, the other main characters feels like they are side characters even yuyu because its always fuckin danji bro, the humor is kinda predictable as well. sure this anime has its enjoyable scenes but as of this moment, the anime is not very good. I hope that overtime it will improve, I really hope somewhere between the 7 remaining episodes yet to be shown ( as of writing this, the show is still on episode 5) it will shift to a more serious, not so slice of lifey anime (which it will most definitely do, its how they handle it is what im wondering about) and eventually will change my opinion because i really really want to like this show tbh and as much as i love danji it feels like they show him a bit too much honestly. the show&#039;s first episode started off with a banger so im not giving up hope. also eugene best deck

    I will admit that I may rate this anime too high but I really like this season of Vanguard. It&#039;s meant to go on a different direction of the previous season and it really shows. It&#039;s meant to be more character heavy and it really shows. Sure there were filler episodes and some odd stuff but it&#039;s all meant for us to know the characters and lead up to the heavy stuff that may occur in season 2.<br />
<br />
Now for what people complain about in terms of the anime being a card game anime. I felt that they did a good job at visually showing how

          <span style="display: none;" id="review413534">
        some of the decks work. Sure they are pretty fast and things can be confusing but it&#039;s a huge example of show don&#039;t tell. Like when we see Tomari take cards away from her opponent&#039;s field with a cage, it&#039;s meant to show her prison gimmick of her deck. While I understand the grievances of everybody, I thought they did a decent job. <br />
<br />
They mostly do this because the anime is meant to appeal to a general audience. Not everyone is going to understand how the game works. While the OG series does get people learning, Overdress is meant to invite people before new fans get into the game. I mostly got a friend who was not into card game anime to watch just for that one awesome but funny moment in episode 12 or the apex of card gaming. If you seen it, you know what I am talking about. Not explaining it due to spoilers.<br />
<br />
Now for the good stuff, the characters. The way they interact, the situations they get into, and what we learn about them is great. I especially love Danji for his Big Brother vibe while being a bit goofy which helps him be a bit dynamic. And the whole thing is pretty down to Earth with some relatable problems (to an extent). You got to give it to Overdress to not relying on the supernatural to have a story. Not only that, we do see the protagonist having to train and learn how to play the game while being a part of a community that help him out. So he&#039;s not just good on the get go and I hope to see him get better.<br />
<br />
Overall, I felt the hate in Overdress is unwarranted and I felt most of the flaws can be expanded on in season 2 or there is a legit reason to them.

    I&#039;ve never watched any Cardfight Vanguard series and wasn&#039;t really going into this expecting anything amazing but this surprised me a lot in various aspects. <br />
I realized right away that the animation was familiar and after a quick search I found out that Clamp designed the characters, a big plus as a Clamp fan. The animation overall was really good, not just the character designs but the movement, facial expressions, and the backgrounds as well were amazing with the detail.<br />
<br />
Another aspect I really liked was the score, especially later on when Danji bought a music CD and the music changed to classical lullaby. It all

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409258">
        felt very natural and suited the scenes very well. Music is one thing that can make or break a show and this anime did a very good job. <br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, I&#039;ve never been interested in anime about card games so I never bothered to watch anything like Cardfight Vanguard, but this show kept my attention throughout all 12 episodes. I would say this is because it doesn&#039;t focus on just the card game, if it did then I would&#039;ve probably dropped it instantly. <br />
<br />
There are no long drawn out scenes (like in some sports anime) where the characters constantly talk to themselves about their card, their opponents cards, or what plans they have to win. Although I&#039;m not familiar with the series, this decision felt as if it&#039;s partially for the sake of old time viewers that know about the game already. It gives the illusion that the viewer could be a veteran looking at the new generation of players trying out a fun card game. There are some introductions to the cards, and at the end of every episode a character will explain about a featured card. It doesn&#039;t go too in depth though, which I appreciate. It feels like both newbie card players and veterans alike can enjoy this anime this way. <br />
<br />
My favorite aspect of this show is the characters. Each episode takes its time to introduce us to the characters, it shows their personality, their habits, thoughts, pasts, etc. Because I personally don&#039;t care about the whole &#039;card game&#039; plot I really loved that the characters were well built. Of course I don&#039;t like every character but it&#039;s interesting learning more about them and being able to see them in a new light. <br />
<br />
I particularly love Yuyu, he&#039;s an amazing protagonist in my opinion because of one very large reason. This is the fact that from the very beginning he was never an independent and bull-headed typical protag, but rather he&#039;s a caring person (quite the pushover actually) that treasures relationships most. I really love that his love for his friends isn&#039;t outshined by his love for playing the cardfight game. Many protags too often get too caught up in the flow, they&#039;re too obsessed with winning or being the strongest or whatever. Yuyu cares about what&#039;s really important, which is to have fun with friends, and this isn&#039;t care isn&#039;t tossed aside later in the story. He isn&#039;t forced to &#039;grow as a character&#039; through hardship and by being defeated, that just makes him suffer, what makes him grow is the support he gets from the friends he made from being introduced through the card game, both through playing the game and from outside interactions.<br />
<br />
I also love Tohru and Danji for two similar reasons, they are both older and veterans of the game (probably similar to a lot of viewers), but they both have a complicated relationship with the game itself. They both are aware that they are getting older and such a game isn&#039;t typically played by older people. One maintains his love for the game but chooses to distance himself from it, although never cutting it off fully he knows that this game isn&#039;t what he really needs in life. The other can&#039;t accept that he&#039;s playing a &#039;game&#039; at such an old age and tries to twist his worldview to make the game fit into his life, ultimately leading him to make bad choices and ignore his original love for the game. They are both interesting in how they view the game and how they choose to interact with it and others through playing.<br />
The ending was quite dramatic but I&#039;m hoping for a second season, this anime was very enjoyable.

    Having never seen any part of the Vanguard series, I was excited to see a whole new reboot that might prepare me for the transition into this world. What I saw, and what&#039;s out so far, has done nothing but confuse me. <br />
<br />
Before I gave overDress a shot, I tried to read as many reviews (on the first episode) as I could from my fellow Crunchyroll watchers to see if a newbie, like me, could get into this series with this reboot. A common remark was that overDress was meant for old watchers and new watchers, alike, to come and enjoy! Great, right? Not great.

          <span style="display: none;" id="review396184">
        overDress has none of the charm that I want in my cardgame anime. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve seen many shows from Yugioh to Beyblade to WIXOSS, and this show just doesn&#039;t hit the spot. It isn&#039;t cute and quirky like Beyblade, and it most certainly isn&#039;t high stakes like WIXOSS and how Yugioh eventually becomes. It doesn&#039;t focus on the game. In fact, the game is like a hobby it just speeds through to focus more on the relationships between characters -- only, it gets the character development wrong too. <br />
<br />
What do I know about the characters? Yu-yu&#039;s family forces him to dress as a girl for their own sick pleasure, regardless of his uncomfortability with it. Zakusa is more of a main character than Touya, and Zakusa has no personality besides being &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;artistic&quot;. Megumi has a crush on the only cute and relatable character, her &quot;onii-chan&quot;, Danji. But Danji has a major loli fetish and is apparently okay with Yu-yu being called his girlfriend? The main plot of the second episode was only a painstaking following of Megumi thinking Danji is gay for Yu-yu (which he very well might be, but it crudely gets written off as a joke). <br />
<br />
The only two saving graces of this show is that the opening and ending are quite good. I never skipped them when watching what little I did. And, of course, I adore CLAMP&#039;S artstyle. They did a great job on the designs. I only wish &quot;sounding good&quot; and &quot;being pretty&quot; could count for more, but this does not save overDress from the disaster that it is. <br />
<br />
(Side note: Yu-yu&#039;s design reminds me a LOT of Inuzuka Shino from Hakkenden)<br />
<br />
I did not enjoy watching what I did of overDress. I had hoped it would get better, and it seemed like it might in the third episode, but the pacing is all over the place. Especially as someone new to Vanguard, I do not get the card game at all -- which is the whole point of watching shows like this! Ride? Call? Damage check? I had to watch the first episode of the 2011 show to get what any of this meant! overDress was just poorly executed with awful pacing, and very little charm that could capture a new audience OR retain the attention of the old.<br />
<br />
If you&#039;re thinking of watching this, new or old, I&#039;d say there are better shows out there about cardgames. If you&#039;re just watching to add to your repertoire, that&#039;s completely all well and good, but I do deem it a waste of energy and time.

    I like the characters and I think the setting of the fights is interesting. <br />
It’s good to see for  change it’s not another card shop.<br />
<br />
Though I think the story at this point really focus on the card game itself. <br />
The fact that they didn’t visualize the fights like previous shows really makes it hard to understand the fight itself. <br />
<br />
Instead they are throwing us at end of the battle animation battle. Suddenly it’s a physical fight. Why change something that was not broken ? <br />
<br />
In the end, it makes really bad introduction to new players.  <br />
<br />
I think there is potential to this Vanguard

          <span style="display: none;" id="review397274">
        but they need to make Cardfight battles that we can actually be excited and understand.

    Not sure exactly what they were going for with this show. Main protag is.. pathetic, reminiscent of the protag in caretaker of Sonohara save for the later has a growing backbone. The show may have been trying to sell a card game like yu-gi-oh, but if this is the case it does a horrible job. The first fight gives no concept of how the game works and felt like watching to 6 yr olds argue over who took how much damage while playing at heroes. This perhaps was the largest turn off. it all just seems shallow.<br />
<br />
All in all not my cup of tea but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review409498">
        I&#039;m sure there is a certain subsect of Anime fans that will ride this ship to port.<br />
<br />
alright apparently this has to be longer so yea guess ill pontificate.<br />
<br />
art was solid for the most part actually really nice in some scenes and meh in some of the battle ones.<br />
<br />
The sound was decent, I liked the OP<br />
