    When I was a kid, I noticed a pattern, a law of sorts, that every so often I would look back on my self from 2 years ago and cringe. I would see my former self for a fool and be ashamed of how stupid he was. This law definitely didn’t keep holding true forever, but upon re-watching this weird anime I watched 2 years ago, I suddenly had that same feeling again. I don’t feel it quite as strongly; I definitely don’t feel I was an idiot for looking at this anime the way I did, but I do feel like I was far

          <span style="display: none;" id="review314221">
        less worldly at the time.	<br />
<br />
	This is an anime about American president Donald Trump going to a Japanese grade school as a transfer student, but that description could not be less helpful in explaining what’s going on. The fact of the matter is, that this anime is making fun of Trump. It can’t be called criticism. None of Trump’s political stances are named in it. Instead these two episodes attack Trump’s over the top character. Attacks on Trump’s character have always been common, but remain ineffective. To his supporters, you see, his personality is his strongest attribute and criticizing it is a worthless pursuit. As such, all that remains to be seen here is a shallow satire that’s somewhat baffling in it’s usage of comedy.	<br />
<br />
 	Or at least, that’s about how far I came when I first watched it. And to be fair, at the time, that was enough for me to list it with a 10 out of 10 score and proclaim it to be the be-all-end-all of anime, that no anime would ever surpass. Fair. I can still kind of see that. But that way of looking at it was just as shallow as the show itself and both people meme-ing about how great it was as well as it’s detractors were just as shallow. But the thing is, I keep coming back to this anime, time and time again. Why is that? Why do I keep thinking about it? Why is Trump rapping in this? Why does he keep swinging his balls around? Who made this and why? And why is trump’s hair a lunchbox?	<br />
<br />
 	Well it would be understandable to blame all this nonsense on the weird comedic style of it’s creator: Takashi Taniguchi. He’s been making weird animations like this for years. Before this he was most famous for Mori no Andou, a web short that is hilarious with friends and mildly funny without them. There’s a lot of lol-random style humor in his works, but they’ve always managed to find an audience by just being so out there that it didn’t matter. This one makes heavy use of Donald Trump to make that happen and I can see why. Taneguchi’s work is full of weird personalities and Trump fits right in among them. What’s more baffling is the way he’s introduced. The first half of the first episode is entirely build up. First the school bell rings, then the teacher tells his class that they are having a transfer student coming in today and then the door slowly opens revealing Trump: A long build up with an explosive punchline. His works may be weird, but at least Taniguchi knows what he’s doing. (That kinda reminds me of the time I went back to some old smosh videos and realized that, though I thought the substance of the jokes were incredibly unfunny, the comedic timing and pathos were masterful)	<br />
<br />
 	I didn’t quite recognize this as a Taniguchi work, when I first watched this and when I did find out I felt stupid for not realizing it earlier. Taniguchi’s works are usually immediately recognizable. His visual style involves these weirdly shaded, dumb looking faces. The faces in this anime were less detailed, except for that of Trump. But Trump looks so different from Taniguchi’s other works, that It took me a while to find out this anime was his. Even so, as is true with this work, the faces are always the best part of a Taniguchi work, and are the factor that make the comedy work. If Taniguchi wasn’t able to draw this way, I don’t think his works would have caught on. It should not be understated how much I like his drawing style and how much personality it has.	<br />
<br />
 	Trump’s character design is definitely nothing to be snuffed at either. He’s drawn short and stumpy, like a weird, humanoid cave creature. His upper body is too big for his legs, but not by a crazy amount. He’s wearing a suit on his upper body and shorts on his lower half. I’d assume the idea is to contrast his childlike attitude with his position as a businessman and President. He’s wearing a backpack on his back, a symbol of elementary school in Japan, and there’s a recorder sticking out of it. Trump may be here to make a mess of things, but at least he’s brought his stuff. The most striking parts of his character design are his dumb ass looking face and the fact that he constantly points upwards with his right hand. He’s not animated, except for a few lip-flaps here and there, and this is a staple of Taniguchi’s works. Taniguchi has to animate all his shorts entirely by himself, so he must have figured smoothness of animation wasn’t going to matter much, if the appeal of his works lay elsewhere. I’d say he was definitely correct in thinking this, and I even think the barely animated style makes his work funnier.	<br />
<br />
 	Besides that there is one more noteworthy visual in this anime. Late into episode 1 there is a moment where Trump pisses all over the place. This drawing of him has far more work put into it than any other in the show. In fact, though it looks really gross, I definitely love Taniguchi’s unique shading work on this image. Regardless of whether you like what you see here, it’s hard to argue that this image in particular, isn’t well crafted, impactful and extremely memorable.	<br />
<br />
 	And what an appearance he must seem to these poor children. The teacher announces that there will be a transfer student coming in today and the class is immediately excited. The trope of the transfer student is a common one in anime and is almost as iconic as the trope where characters eat and either hate the food or think it’s the best they’ve ever eaten. But unlike the food trope, a new transfer student can be absolutely anything. What a shock must it then be for the new student to come in and rap and piss all over the place. Donald Trump is definitely the last thing you’d expect to walk into your classroom. His appearance is preceded by several seconds of dramatic sounding music, clearly meant to build suspense as the door slowly opens and Trump comes in and I definitely think that without these few seconds of extra build up, the moment where he starts rapping and all hell breaks loose would have been less effective.. Again, though I don’t find this anime to be all that funny on it’s own, I do believe it to be well crafted. Taniguchi clearly is experienced in his craft and knows what he’s doing.	<br />
<br />
 	But that brings me to the question. Why is Trump going to school? Is it a cheap jab at the fact that Trump seems to act in a somewhat juvenile manner? Is it just to say: “Ha ha, look at what a kid that guy is, look at how gross he is.” I mean that seems unlike Taniguchi. Sure he’s not beyond making childish jokes like that, but he seems to revel in gross and weird stuff. Why would he of all people criticize Trump for being obscene? I don’t see any references to what Trump has said or done either. This anime is solely about the ridiculousness of the idea of Trump coming into a primary school and making a mess of things whilst rapping. I don’t think this anime is a jab at Trump at all. I don’t think Taniguchi is pro Trump or anything, but I do think he appreciates his comedic value. I think he saw Trump not as a cultural or political icon to take down, but rather as a fantastic piece for his weird and obscene, animated art. And that brings me to my next question. Why make this? Why create such a weird and daring short? 	<br />
<br />
 	Was it just for attention? Around that same time Taniguchi would make a collaboration with Daimaou Kosaka, who in the west Is most known for a somewhat recent meme clip where he put to things together and people made all kinds of edits of it. It could be that Taniguchi is trying to expand his audience with collaborations and political anime. But just sit down and think about it for a second. For that to work, ultimately what would need to happen is for people to share these anime with each other. It doesn’t matter to me whether taniguchi is doing all of this out of a desire to grow his audience, or out of a love for his craft. I can’t figure that out anyways, because there isn’t enough information about him <br />
available in English. What matters is the fact that elements like Trump in his works, make them more shareable. And that’s what it’s all about: watching this weird anime together.	<br />
<br />
 	This anime takes place in school and when I first watched it, I too was in school. I know how eerie that coincidence must seem to you, but hear me out. I was kind of a loner in school so I never got to show this anime to too many people, but showing it to people was always fun. Sure they always reacted somewhat aversely, but that was half the fun in it! I remember watching Mori no Andou with friends an it being way funnier than it was alone. And that was an experience that stuck with me forever.	<br />
<br />
 	I see some weird criticisms of the show such as that it is dumb and repulsive(like, literally the point of the whole thing) or more bafflingly, that the characters are weak. The characters are weak? Trump comes strolling into school rapping about himself and pissing all over the place, showing no remorse whatsoever. That’s the most character I’ve seen in a character introduction since Bumi’s introduction in Legend of Korra. I mean there’s being weirded out by a show and not liking it and there’s having weird detached ideas about a show’s quality that don’t make sense at all if you actually watch it.	<br />
<br />
 	Weird tangents aside though, the point I’m trying to make is that I think people woefully misunderstand the point of Trap-kun and other weird works by Taniguchi. The fun in it is not the actual experience of watching it. It’s about the experience of sharing it. Even just reading comments or reviews about it is participating.  But the best experience to be had with Trap-kun is showing it to friends or cousins and watching them be weirded out, as they don’t know what to represent and what to repress out of their reaction. You put them on edge, into a weird social situation they were not prepared for; you laugh together; you’re grossed out together. You laugh at each other&#039;s reactions. You both go out to show it to more friends. And then you look up into the sky and you jokingly ponder what went wrong in humanities development that it would lead to this; and then you wonder if maybe the creation of Trap-kun was an inevitability of the universe and there simply couldn’t mathematically exist a universe that didn’t spawn this exact anime; and then you wonder if the universe was created by higher beings for the express purpose of creating this specific weird anime or if otherwise, humanity was by mother earth.	<br />
<br />
 	It all seems so silly, but those moments spent with your friends are a valuable treasure you keep with you for your whole life. This anime, you could say, is a meta-modernist piece of work, where the point of it can’t simply be found in the work itself, but also in the people around it. What made this anime valuable is that people talked about it and shared it, so much so that you are reading this lengthy ass review about it. This review is a part of Taniguchi’s art and of your experience of it, that can simply not be denied. And this anime would be infinitely less valuable without the funny comments you read about them, without the people you share it with, without this review, that you’ve read all the way through, either because you’re intrigued by it, or because you’re bored out of your mind. What else could you think whilst watching this show for the first time but “Wow this is the weirdest shit I’ve ever seen. Can’t wait to see other people’s reactions to it.”, as you proceed to scroll down to read the comments.  And in that sense, I argue that this weird, obtuse piece of art is just as valuable as a normal, conventional, well made 12 episode tv anime. The experience you had with this is not any less valuable because it’s weird or because your enjoyment of it was unconventionally obtained. I recognize that a lot of people genuinely dislike this show, and that’s of course acceptable but I couldn’t help myself but recognize a lot of the negativity towards this show to be shallow and poorly thought through in nature. What I want to do here is to help you, dear reader, cope with more unconventional ideas of how media could exist and how it could be enjoyed and thought about.	<br />
<br />
 	But all that ranting aside, in short, I like this show, not because I think it’s enjoyable to watch, but because I like the idea of it and the surrounding culture. And now, having made this lengthy review that I conned you into reading all the way through I am part of that surrounding culture and as an extension, I’m part of this artwork and so are you reading; we are all art.	<br />
<br />
But wait… I still haven’t answered the question: why is Trump’s head a bento? Ah shit this throws off all my calculations. All my theories are useless now. I’m gonna have to start again from the beginning and go back down the rabbit hole…Well, see you next time reader, if I survive another deepdive that is...<br />
<br />
Also, to whomever poor mod that has to read through this whole review… I’m deeply, deeply sorry. I’ll buy you a beer if we ever meet in real life, I promise!<br />

    I think talking about your favourite anime is quite a hard topic to ponder on; especially when you are so up taken by the features of the show to find any negative aspects that others hold against the show. Here is my example of this factor, a show that stand above the others and which I hold high on a pedestal. “Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun”<br />
<br />
Featuring the highly beloved main character Trump-sama, we get an insight as to what he would be like on a regular basis if he was the combination of Japanese, a high schooler and simultaneously a rapper. I found myself in disbelief when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review245962">
        I first stumbled upon this title, why would this be made? But also at the same time I was joyful; this was a topic I was hoping for an anime to cover from the very start of Trump’s election campaign. We previously have seen Obama in the lime-light of anime but with Trump’s recent takeover of the position of president waiting for his anime debut was something that was a very tedious procedure; but I never expected to find such a thing in this calibre of entertainment. This anime is so strange but so entertaining at the same time. With such a weird concept presented in such a manner that everyone can get a good laugh out of it; even if they then proceed to then drop the anime and score it a 1. <br />
<br />
As a vivid fan of a show such of this I hope one day that this can reach the highest popularity on MyAnimeList because if you haven’t watched this masterpiece you obviously are doing something wrong with your free-time. It only takes 1 minute and the outcome and reward of watching the show is well worth it. I really do not expect such an anime to grace us in the same way as this has and I respect whoever thought of this idea to have the balls to go and make this into an anime. Because what is more fun than poking fun out of a real person in such a way that can unite everyone together to laugh at it.<br />
<br />
Now I will go over the surface of what to expect when entering this anime as although I have talked about its brilliance in the form of being a hilarious thing to watch, there are many other features being poured into this anime that make it so great. The art style does look terrible but it adds to the comedic effect. Trump is presented as being an idiot in this piece something that many people view him as; the art style is so simple and absurd it adds to the experience as something you can easily remember from the experience. In the sound department each episode grants us with a new rap performed by Trump with actual no meaning at all, they just put words in a hat at the studio and pull out whatever they find and cram it into a rap for Trump’s VA to sing I presume.<br />
<br />
I love this anime for its absurdity, what more could you ask for than a short piece of media poking fun at Trump in such a crude fashion. I believe it is worth watching no matter what tastes you have in shows, as I’ve mentioned before it has a short length but provides high enjoyment all around and is something everyone should at least experience once. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this anime the same way I do.<br />

    This is literally just some dumb bullshit you do a “try not to cringe” video on. You&#039;d watch this dreck being reacted to by teenagers on a Fine Bros. video. It&#039;s ugly, with pathetic gross-out humor even kids wouldn&#039;t laugh at, and the rap music is fucking garbage thanks to whoever is rapping; Crap-kun isn&#039;t even good shitposting.<br />
<br />
So yeah, 2017 out of 2016; China Walls in Mexico and we paid for it. It&#039;s basically like Utsu Musume Sayuri and other short, worthless, infamous bile that barely constitutes as “necessary bad viewing” material that aren&#039;t even meme worthy anymore. There’s nothing left to add to this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review274370">
        one. What? Try to criticize the lack of narrative? What are you, fucking stupid? What, criticize Trump as an anime character? What are you on, the fallacy virus? Think you can still review this? Put it simply, you&#039;re, say it with me now: “wrong!” <br />
<br />
Literally only watch this if you like the brand of filler trash mentioned above; everyone else can walk out and post some Donald Trump memes instead. At least those can garner an actual laugh.<br />
<br />
Also, the 2016 election was a mistake; good day everyone!<br />

Overview:<br />
<br />
Every now and then an anime arrives that completely changes the medium forever. Angel&#039;s Egg helped usher in postmodernism and heavy religeous symbolism to a medium that until then wasn&#039;t being taken very seriously. Evangelion forever changed the face of Shonen and anime in general with its character psychology and exploration of human depression and the search for self acceptance. Now in 2017 we have this....MASTERPIECE. <br />

Plot: 10/10<br />

Donald Trump raps in a classroom and teaches us all the brilliance of his political vision. I admit, until now I&#039;ve always been a tad skeptical of Trump&#039;s political competence. I was once a total normie. I seem

Of course, but the alternative was actually voting for this utter buffoon to be leader of the West. I simply didn&#039;t believe. Now all of that has changed! I have red pilled and joined the centipede army! MAGA!<br />

Thank you some random Japanese studio I&#039;ve never heard of! Thank you for allowing me to attain enlightenment and join the flock of the God Emperor. If you have friends or relatives who doubt our Lord and Savior Donald J Trump, show them this marvelous anime. If you love Trump already, watch this shit every day while you eat breakfast. This is how I will start every day for the rest of my life!

    &quot;People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non subjective viewpoint it&#039;s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbley ... timey wimey ... stuff&quot; - The Doctor<br />
<br />
When it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of time travel. Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of &quot;reality&quot; is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the inherent paradoxes that

          <span style="display: none;" id="review382583">
        will occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.<br />
<br />
In other words, they make it up.<br />
<br />
More often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.<br />
<br />
Until now ...<br />
<br />
Originally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his &quot;colleagues&quot; at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida &quot;Daru&quot; Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.<br />
<br />
For the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and &quot;do overs&quot; that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schrödinger&#039;s Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it&#039;s not all fun and games.<br />
<br />
One of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of &quot;scientific&quot; reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s also the matter of the rather &quot;neat&quot; ending, but we&#039;ll get to that in a bit.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there&#039;s an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they&#039;ve been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It&#039;s unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.<br />
<br />
This mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn&#039;t need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters&#039; attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they&#039;re the ones that carry this series. If it wasn&#039;t for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it&#039;s thanks to the seiyuu&#039;s abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.<br />
<br />
The opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).<br />
<br />
As for the background music, there&#039;s a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn&#039;t really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe&#039;s development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it&#039;s nice to see that the anime hasn&#039;t shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it&#039;s laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.<br />
<br />
Steins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn&#039;t afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it&#039;s a very enjoyable anime that doesn&#039;t get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he&#039;s supposed to be 18 years old.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to the ending.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a certain ... &quot;clinical&quot; ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn&#039;t sit too well, and while it&#039;s always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he&#039;s moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one&#039;s original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.<br />
<br />
One of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe&#039;s ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on &quot;Fool yourself. Fool the world&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.<br />
<br />
It&#039;s just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.<br />

    Just when you think you&#039;ve seen everything, this show comes along.<br />
<br />
If you didn&#039;t already know, this is a 1 minute anime about Donald Trump rapping, which to be frank is hilarious and horrifying at the same time.<br />
Since the episodes are only 1 minute long, basically nothing of importance happens, unless you consider Donald Trump rapping to be very important.<br />
<br />
The animation style reminds me of shows like Onara Gorou and Andou of the Forest, which are certainly unique, but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
This is the weirdest thing I&#039;ve seen in a while, and I can&#039;t wait to see what more ridiculous things will happen.<br />
<br />
No matter if you think

    Yep, I&#039;ll be another party poop and ruin the review section with my sub-par meme making skills because my current mood is at the all time low and that only further depletes my supply of creative juices. But can you really blame me? This is just so repulsive yet I can&#039;t stop replaying these 2 short episodes. This hot mess of sophomoric humor is dragging me down. Please... Send... Help...<br />
<br />
This is where I tell you that you don&#039;t have anything to lose and that it&#039;ll only take like a minute of your life. But... But, these are all lies! These other reviews are trying to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review295267">
        deceive you! There is nothing down here! We fell into this pit of misery and only more suffering awaits. If you managed to dodge a bullet and only watch it once, then I commend you and at the same time challenge you to watch it 10 more times. Be a true madman, live life on the edge, or be a smart person and never look back. Sadly, I was too weak. I couldn&#039;t escape and I&#039;m now stuck in this vicious cycle of never ending pain. In the distance, I can softly but clearly hear the echoes of Trap-kun&#039;s freestyles. It&#039;s the worst when he&#039;s near, when I can hear a murmur and it&#039;s very unsettling. I&#039;m very afraid. I am sad, I am gone. Arrivederci, ore no freund.

    Well that was a thing. Sometimes you just come across something that reminds you that yeah anime is kinda weird and this is no exception. <br />
<br />
Over the course of less than 2 minutes I saw a tiny cartoon gremlin resembling a US president walk in a class full of japanese grade schoolers, fart in the teachers face, piss all over the class, flirt with a little girl and throw away his 5 kg stone wig... while rapping.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t say that any of this was well done but if someone put a significant amount of effort into executing something like this I can&#039;t say if it

    (This review contains spoilers)<br />
<br />
&#039;Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun&#039; is the absolute worst thing my eyes have ever had to and ever will witness. It is truly beyond me why a narrative like this was portrayed in such a way. It is so horrific that I feel the need to convey my hatred for this piece with the people of MAL, so I shall begin.<br />
<br />
Story - 1: The story for &#039;Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun&#039; is putrid, juvenile, and absolutely unrealistic to the point where a child straight out of the womb would be able to detect the flaws in it. The story begins with a teacher introducing our main

          <span style="display: none;" id="review363576">
        character, Trap-kun, to the class as a new transfer student, who clearly represents the United States President Donald Trump, though in an abhorrently and insulting way. Trap-kun then proceeds to perform extremely indecent acts which are very much contrary to Mr Trump&#039;s real actions. These include: stripping, pissing everywhere, and attempting to get in a relationship with a schoolgirl by inserting her head into his anus, all while in front of children. As you can see from the inconsistency and unrealistic nature of these events, &#039;Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun&#039;s narrative has too many flaws to miss, and results in an absolutely appalling story.<br />
<br />
Art - 1: The art is truly nothing special, and is disappointing considering the length of the show. This further proves the minimal effort of the studio behind this garbage.<br />
<br />
Sound - 1: The soundtrack for this fictional piece is what sounds like only 2 different songs played at different speeds a total of 2 times. It doesn&#039;t help that the music isn&#039;t very good on its own, and the terrible writing of Trap-kun&#039;s raps only make it worse.<br />
<br />
Character - 1: Usually, anything which involves Donald Trump is deserving of a high score, such as my all-time favourite novel: &#039;Trump: The Art Of The Deal&#039; and the 2016 Election Arc, but the reason &#039;Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun&#039; has scored a 1 for character is due to its disgusting portrayal of not only Mr Trump, but also the teacher and students. Every character in this show is excessively shallow, except for Trap-kun, who doesn&#039;t make up for it due to his abysmal writing.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment and Overall - 1: &#039;Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun&#039; is barely a piece of work. It is one which is infested with flaws and incorrect portrayals of real people in our society, and contains no sort of redeeming factor throughout its awfully short runtime. It does&#039;nt help when like one third of each episode is an advertisement for some stupid playing cards. In my honest and humble opinion, this anime would be much better and more significant were it named &#039;Yo! Daitouryou Biden-kun&#039;, and the main character was replaced with that of Joe Biden, as then it would at least be a realistic and accurate portrayal of its main character in animated form. This is not only insulting for me, nor is it for the United States of America, but it is insulting to the entire world.

    This is probably one of the most revolting things I&#039;ve seen an anime do. Not only did they make an anime of Donald Trump, it&#039;s an anime, or a propaganda, to ridicule and to defame Donald Trump based from his looks and appearance alone. Just so you know, I&#039;m not a huge fan of Donald Trump. Nor am I a fan of Hilary would couldn&#039;t be anymore transparent about her emails, and have said some pretty racist stuff, and are associated to many racist group like the KKK and being a goldwater girl and all in the past as well.<br />
<br />
Frankly, this anime was disgusting. This

          <span style="display: none;" id="review246022">
        is why an outsider shouldn&#039;t even be allow to voice an opinion, or being shared a bias view that hasn&#039;t been verified, and has actually been shown a lie even after Trump became president. Those lie would include things like, he&#039;s a mysogynist (ignoring the fact that he wanted to treat veteran of all gender equally), he&#039;s racist (ignoring the fact that he wanted to better the inner city), he&#039;s a dictator (judging him his appearance alone), and so on. I aint gonna rant about how dumb these reasons for a cartoon (like ones that Stephen Colbert shows, and other media outlet) or an anime to ridicule someone for a none tangible reason for hatred. I guess the start of I hate Trump was when he sign up for the republican party. Even though in the past, fucking liberals were asking him and interviewing him questions of whether he would run for the election as a democratic party or not. They should fucking be happy that he even run. <br />
<br />
For an anime to stoop this low, or for any people and one that I could definitely name is Stephen Colbert, to make a cartoon to ridicule someone and hold an opinion of spreading those hate. That alone would likely make them the evil ones. You live a life feeding off on the popularity of hating someone for the things that they haven&#039;t done, or believed in the narratives that you asserted to the person. For anyone that is rating this 10/10 or more of more than 3. You&#039;re a disgusting human being. Sadly people nowadays like the idea of cyber bully someone if they are hatred by their small group of community that are hating on a certain someone as well. That spread of hate alone is evil and you should really stop, especially if the person was never evil in the first place or done anything horrible. Why is our world criticising Trump more than Hilary? I would want more criticism on Hilary than Trump really. Is it because Hilary is a women? Like why would that matter seriously. Most women who voted for Hilary only to have a woman president to run the country. I could go all political all day but I aint. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, since emotional and animalistic reasoning always valued more than logic and factual reasoning. I can&#039;t really do anything much here aside from stating the obvious that these animators are an extremely revolting and disgusting hate group of people who are trying to live off their career through spreading hate. Many of the elderly in Japan btw,sided with Trump. So I can&#039;t really blame the entirety of Japan for this since this Japan that we&#039;re talking about here, at least in the context of anime, are the otaku community in Japan. The community that make less revenue than kids show that runs in the morning of Japan TV channel. We people watch the late night ones, the less successful animes. Kids anime are the most successful in Japan fun fact. Many people outside the otaku community even hate or just show sheer dislike for the anime culture in general. That aside, these kind of anime shouldn&#039;t even be allow to get a budget for its animation. Propaganda video in 2017? Are you serious? This aint the past where dehumanization of humans based from baseless generalization is okay anymore. They even make Trump fucking do the most disgusting things and in this anime as well. I just can&#039;t get along with the voice actors, animators, staffs, director, and the author really. Doing something so revolting and expected themselves to be the more humane person. Fuck off you savages.

    I gonna be completely honest here, it&#039;s 6:04 am, I was bored and I&#039;m not gonna spend more than 90 seconds to write this cause I already spent them watching this bizarre thing. <br />
Out of curiosity while making my MAL list I found this bizarre thing and as it was short I just click cause it was easy. Nevermind, I thought I could get something from it but this is gonna be a thing Imma use to troll people. Time&#039;s up! 2 minutes have passed :c mum, I failed you D:<br />
<br />
PD: oh m8 I had to write a longer review? ok, hum... hey, you know

    Ohoho... Where do I begin with this anime. I knew I would love it from the start...Oh man... and watching it just completely confirmed my suspicions. There&#039;s no doubt about that. It is truly a masterpiece... and beyond even that.<br />
<br />
I was utterly enraptured the entire time-The experience of watching it was truly enchanting... I simply couldn&#039;t look away. I never truly got over it and it&#039;s already been two years. I rewatch the episodes whenever I get the chance to...And I always get something new out of it.<br />
There were only two episodes, but it left me wanting so much more. Oh, how I wish Shogakukan

          <span style="display: none;" id="review308462">
        would produce more episodes... I&#039;d love if this anime got even half as many eps as Inuyasha. That would truly be a dream come true for me... But I can&#039;t be too biased, I need to give you all a fair idea of this anime. :3<br />
<br />
Story (10/10): I&#039;m not sure I can do it justice, but I&#039;ll certainly try to summarize it... <br />
Trap-Kun is the beloved president of the United States, who, in an attempt to strengthen relations with Japan, (he&#039;s so thoughtful...) transfers to an ordinary Japanese High School. <br />
There, he quickly befriends all the students and they adore him and his rapping skills. It may seem simple when it&#039;s laid out like this, but it was executed so well... The relationships Trap-senpai builds with his fellow students feels so fleshed-out and complex. Trap-kun takes his time with all the students and though they know he&#039;s out of their league, they often show their love and devotion to him. And although Trap-kun himself is wonderful from the beginning and due to this, he doesn&#039;t go through much character development..he&#039;s never a bore to watch. Far from it.<br />
<br />
Art (10/10): The art is so beautiful... It captures the emotion and feel of the characters so well... And the backgrounds always look appropriate for the situation. Sometimes, I wish more anime had this art-style... But I feel like they wouldn&#039;t use it to their advantage as well. The production team of this anime truly did the Lord&#039;s work.<br />
It makes me want to learn how to draw in this art-style. Unfortunately, I&#039;m not very talented and I can only draw stick figures. (Trust me, I tried ten years ago.)<br />
<br />
Sound (10/10): Though it&#039;s extremely hard for me to decide, the music and sound are definitely one of my favorite parts of this anime. <br />
They clearly put a lot of effort into Trap-kun&#039;s rap segments. His rapping skills are on-pointe and I&#039;m sure they edited his voice actor&#039;s voice for him to sound that amazing...The instrumental helps him get into the flow of things, but the vocals are clearly still the highlight here. Oh and the lyrics are so descriptive and beautiful... Like when Trap-kun sings about his hair and his struggles with it... (He&#039;s so modest, but his golden hair is so great-looking, even the birds want to nest in it.)<br />
<br />
I just wish they&#039;d release the official soundtrack already... I&#039;m sure they will, but I hate waiting...<br />
<br />
Character (10/10): Trap-kun is arguably one of the most well-designed characters I&#039;ve come across in animation. I wish there were people like him in real life. The closest I&#039;ve come to finding one is Schwarzenegger, but his voice isn&#039;t that similar, sadly... :/ I love Trap&#039;s personality as well. He&#039;s a magnificent specimen, all in all. And the other characters help to compliment that.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment (∞/10): I enjoyed it so much. So much.<br />
<br />
Overall (10/10): &lt; This website won&#039;t allow any higher. :(<br />
<br />
Please watch it if you&#039;re looking for the time of your life! :3

    Sometimes, on a fated night, when the moon is full and the breeze is right, you stumble upon an anime in which you feel a really deep connection to. This, right here, is one of them.<br />
<br />
The story and sound design of this show plays with your heartstrings in an exquisite and beautiful way. Hearing the harmonious voice of Trap-kun echo through the school halls really adds a sense of depth and meaning to every single scene in which he is present. And the words he sings, the words... I just... I just can&#039;t begin to describe the feeling and pain behind every word he speaks,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review306390">
        every time I hear him my eyes begin to water like a tsunami of pure emotion. It would be difficult to fault this show for anything, it&#039;s all perfect and that&#039;s why I believe it should be rated #1 on this site. Truly a spectacle worth witnessing.<br />

    Yo Daitouryou Trap-Kun is a truly magnificent anime.  Not only is it pleasing to the eyes and ears, but it has a beutiful story. This anime tells the inpring story of one man&#039;s triumph with the power of music. It begins at what looks like an ordinary classroom full of students awaiting another tedious day of school. However, new hope is given to the class when the teacher brings news of a new student transferring into the class. The class fills with excitement as beatiful man gracefully enters the classroom. It is none other than our majestic titular character, Prisendent Trap-Kun. <br />
Trap-Kun is so

        graceful, that he is able to walk without even moving his legs. Once he enters the room, the beautiful president introduces himself with the poetic lyrics of his ballad. Through these lyrics, Trap-Kun delivers a powerful anti-authoritarian message. Trap-Kun makes no hesitation about expressing his defiance as he displays his true power by defeating the teacher once and for all with one single fart and showering the entire class a in a waterfall of unrine. At the end of his song, the source of Trap-Kun&#039;s power is revealed to be food stashed in his head.  <br />
The story is very deep and meaningful, yet inspiring. While the symbolism may be difficult for some to understand, there is still much more to appreciate about this anime. <br />
The sounds are breathtaking. Trap-Kun&#039;s melodic voice adds power to his inpiring lyrics. The fart sound effects are very lifelike. The screams of the teacher perfectly convey his pain as he is suffocated by Trap-kun&#039;s gas. <br />
 The art is no less impressive than the sound. The facial expressions are gorgeous. Trap-kun is especially beatiful. His hair looks like a pile of golden hay. His ass is perfectly round glossy. His face is full of unbridled passion. The face of a true leader.<br />
Watching Yo Daitouryou Trap-Kun is a unique and wonderful experience which words alone cannot describe. This is truly a magnificent work of art.  The only way to truly understand the brilliane of this anime is by watching it.

    I have very simple standards for comedy. It needs to make me laugh. Some very highly rated comedies have kept me at a stone face the whole time. Luckily, this is not one of them. Yo! Daitouryou Trap-Kun made me laugh out loud with its bizarre art, crude humor and unexpected jokes. I believe in order for a comedy to be good, I need to laugh, and I laughed multiple times watching these shorts. The purpose of a comedy is to make me laugh. So thus I give Yo!
