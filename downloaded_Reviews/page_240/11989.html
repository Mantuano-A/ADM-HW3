    There&#039;s bad and then there&#039;s Vampire Holmes. <br />
<br />
I have a hard time understanding what the screenwriters behind this &quot;thing&quot; were thinking when they all sat down to write it. Did they all huddle together, started snickering as someone blurted out &quot;let&#039;s create the tritest, most unfunny thing imaginable!&quot;? Because honestly, I&#039;m having a hard time seeing the inception of this project being anything else. To put it in perspective, shows like Ninja Slayer, Inferno Cop and others are along those lines are Shakespearean masterpieces by comparison. <br />
<br />
This isn&#039;t the &quot;so bad it&#039;s good&quot; kind of title. <br />
This is the &quot;so bad, please end my life&quot;

          <span style="display: none;" id="review188210">
        kind of nonsense.<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t even bring myself to write a troll review dubbing it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; since that would require more care than the show even put forward towards itself. It&#039;s simply not worth that kind of effort — hell, even bothering to write about it is too much as it is.<br />
<br />
Story: &quot;What story?&quot;/10<br />
<br />
Our lead Holmes sits on his ass, acts incompetent, and occasionally attempt to deliver office-cubicle levels of dry humor... rinse and repeat. That&#039;s it, that&#039;s the setup for every episode. <br />
<br />
Art: Cardboard/10<br />
<br />
Animation, what animation? There&#039;s none to speak of. As far as art goes, Southpark&#039;s paper mache cutouts had far more detail than anything belched out by this product. <br />
<br />
Sound: Well... at least it has an opening theme/10<br />
<br />
The only sound here was that of me face-palming myself with each dull line of &quot;comedy&quot; delivered. <br />
<br />
Characters: Caricatures/10<br />
<br />
Holmes was a little shit, his assistant was a little shit, the end.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: Watching Paint Dry/10<br />
<br />
Most shorts are over before they could even leave an impressive, but Vampire Holmes isn&#039;t one of them. It delivered on something, that something was pure cringe-inducing frustration with an extra layer of boredom.<br />
<br />
Overall: Why Bother?/10<br />
<br />
If you have literally nothing better to do with your life, then sure, go for it, but it might be more productive to spend that time picking your nose instead.<br />

    I don&#039;t know if i should laugh like a maniac, or cry like one.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes is a show about Holmes who lives in London (It&#039;s totally not Sherlock Holmes we&#039;re talking about) and solves mysteries. The only mystery so far in the story, is why the fuck i&#039;m still watching this!<br />
<br />
Story: 3/10<br />
<br />
The story? What story!? The story so far is NOTHING compared to the synopsis. True, he has solved ONE request. &quot;What was that request?! I&#039;m dying to know it!&quot; I can hear you say, ever so sarcastically. He found a lost dog. Yup. NOTHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED. They&#039;ve lazed around in their apartment, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186444">
        that is it!<br />
<br />
Art: 2/10<br />
<br />
If you have seen Inferno Cop, then you&#039;ll immediately know what i&#039;m talking about.<br />
For those who haven&#039;t seen Inferno Cop: The art is incredibly bad! It&#039;s choppy, poorly drawn and the animation typically consists of 2-5 different frames frames.<br />
But unlike Inferno Cop, Vampire Holmes takes itself seriously.<br />
<br />
Sound: 5/10<br />
<br />
This is the only redeeming quality of the show. Well... Redeeming is the wrong word to use.<br />
<br />
The only thing that isn&#039;t bad about this show is the sound. The OP and the ED is the same song, but the song isn&#039;t half bad. It&#039;s most certainly not half good either.<br />
The voice actor for Holmes is a rookie. It&#039;s his second voice acting role. The voice actor for Hudson in the other hand, is well known. You might recognize him as Shinichi from Parasite or Haruka from Free!<br />
<br />
And i fucking swear i heard a sound effect from the Pyro in Team Fortress 2 in the first episode!<br />
<br />
Characters: 3/10<br />
<br />
Holmes is a vampire(?) who sleeps on the floor in a rundown apartment and is on a day to day paycheck that never arrives, since he can&#039;t find any proper cases. Hudson, having just moved in together with Holmes, becomes his protege and is equally chocked as us, on how little content there is in the story.<br />
The third character is the land lady. 17 frames. 17 fucking frames i kid you not! 17 different frames of her has been shows throughout the ENTIRE show, so far.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? Why is that number so high?!&quot; I don&#039;t even know myself. I&#039;m just enjoying the glorious train wreck.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
<br />
The story is nonexistent<br />
The animation is choppy and horrible to look at.<br />
The voice acting is bad.<br />
The OP and ED gets in your head. and slowly drives you crazy.<br />
The characters are a fucking mess.<br />
<br />
THAT is why i fucking enjoy this show so much! It&#039;s hilariously bad. You will laugh out loud and think about what the fuck you&#039;re looking at.<br />
<br />
Besides, it&#039;s only 3 minutes long. Just how bad can it be?<br />
<br />
You have no idea...<br />

    This is Sherlock Holmes.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#039;s,may he rest in peace,novels should be renamed to something else.<br />
<br />
If any work of entertainment in our history deserves the title of &#039;Sherlock Holmes&#039; then it is this anime, and not Arthur Conan Doyle&#039;s novels. This is more Sherlock Holmes than Sherlock Holmes ever was, is, or will be. Epic detective stories in London, grand vision with something to say, something to show, all the while consistent narratively, thematically and audially, never pandering to a clamouring fan base, this is 12 episodes of pure detective,philosophical and psychology drama of the highest quality.This is Sherlock Holmes.<br />
<br />
The story of Vampire Holmes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190617">
        pits two systems of living against each other. Two charismatic men. Delving through politics, military, religion, philosophy and media, it is a detailed anime that rarely ever takes short cuts. This means that we see everything play out and are never expected to just fill in large gaps with our imagination. We don’t just see crimes getting solved, we see the tacticians planning their moves, we don’t just see criminal masterminds causing havoc; we see them deal with the aftermath of their crimes. There are no short cuts in Vampire Holmes, only one long and very entertaining path.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes is like the anime equivalent of Michael Mann&#039;s Heat when it comes to the two protagonists of Holmes and Hudson. They are not in each other’s faces with conflict; they are at a distance yet always on each other&#039;s minds. Human civilisation as their chess board. They are not protagonist and antagonist. They are figureheads who are almost comrades in their strong resolves to end a terrible crime. They are like magnets drawing fate towards them by their personalities alone; then they back it all up with action and propel humanity into a new century.<br />
<br />
Hudsob. The great irony of Hudson is that he is the criminal-wannabe who is destined to solve crimes himself. The anime speaker for Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller&#039;s voices. Those two great literary giants of scathing wit and nonchalance. One of Hudson&#039;s best quotes is the following: &quot;People may need detectives, but they don’t necessarily need the &#039;police&#039;” He is beyond criminalism or humanism. He is a conscientious, self-deprecating, charming and laid back man with the humility to feel intense burden and guilt at his actions, even though he tries to take the path of least violence, he is unintentionally part of a crime syndicat and is directly responsible for millions of deaths. This fact is not lost on the man, and it makes him that much more of anime&#039;s greatest characters.<br />
<br />
Holmes, the more romantic fairytale character, with flowing black hair, unparalleled achievement, aided by his house dog,Kira, to rise through the police ranks of the British-empire with the sole purpose to rescue his friend from the clutches of the empire, with the additional task of reforming and uniting the entire police as a peripheral duty.Holmes is not only the most powerful man in London, but he&#039;s also probably the loneliest. He&#039;s a pretty tragic figure that goes through more conflict than Hudson, considering the autocratic environment he has to wade through, trying to hold onto his soul as the leader of such a system of living is what’s fascinating about his character.<br />
<br />
There are dozens of memorable characters all fully fleshed out, even though they&#039;re supporting members, the fact that an episode is only 3 minutes short means they all get a chance to shine in the spotlight and develop just as well as the two main figureheads. Many names will be etched in your mind after you&#039;ve finished the tale.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes might get flak for having the appearance of being a talky and dry anime but that could not be further from the truth. Because of such excellent characterisation, the emotion and drama of this saga is beyond anything in other anime. When criminals get exposed the sense of loss is palpable, in the same vein of how character deaths in live action cinema affects the viewer, such is the ambition of Vampire Holmes in reaching for greatness beyond the anime medium.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans don’t fight for principles or philosophy. They fight for the person who embodies their principles and philosophy. They don’t fight for crimes, they fight for the criminal.&quot;<br />
<br />
People fight for Holmes and Hudson. They are pyramids, and underneath them are a large cast of characters that are fascinating, fully developed and run the gamut of good to bad to walking the thin line between. One could argue that the criminals are the most interesting group of characters, they get slightly more scenes, they have more skill and cunning, but then the police is more relevant to the majority of viewers watching. They&#039;re more relatable because of the environment they&#039;re in which reflects modern day westernised society very well, warts and all.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holme&#039;s epicness lies in its relation to reality, in that we can actually believe various situations portrayed in the story can happen; that a group of criminals and detectives can band together to fight for equality no matter what the odds.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes investigates and ponders the virtues and shortcomings of these two systems of living with so much depth, so much impartially, it’s a joy. You&#039;re not meant to root for one system because the show doesn’t paint with broad strokes. Whether you prefer one side or the other, both will be populated by characters you like, so not only are you split on an ideological level but also at a basic entertainment level. In fact you&#039;re not really meant to root for any side, you&#039;re an observer to history being made and repeated. Life is cycles.<br />
<br />
When characters talk in Vampire Holmes, they talk to each other and not the viewer. For the most part, this isn’t a show stained by one of the main staples of the anime medium, that number one device used by lazy writers to convey information to the viewer: walking talking expositions. This is an anime that is prime material for such characters, who may as well directly stare at the &#039;camera&#039; and waffle on about what they&#039;re doing for the sole purpose of cluing us in. Not so in Vampire Holmes, as characters only address each other with information that is relevant to them, not us.<br />
<br />
We figure out what&#039;s going on through character actions, not asinine summaries from them. If they bring up something that they already know amongst themselves, then they discuss it in a relatively coherent fashion and not typically clichéd manner. In short the viewer is never treated like a child, we have to actually concentrate when watching this story because the characters aren’t going to wait up for us or spell everything out with easy words.<br />
<br />
Characters will admittedly often sum up their situations in Vampire Holmes, so we can get our bearings, but it’s done naturally as you&#039;d expect for people in a crime situation demanding situation reports, it’s never shoe-horned in. Characters reflect upon experiences a lot, about what they&#039;ve done, what they&#039;re doing and what they will do in the future, so a lot of information is conveyed but the most important fact is that they&#039;re talking to each other and not the viewer. You will rarely ever question the intelligence of characters, you will rarely exclaim &quot;you&#039;re so stupid!&quot; because most of the characters featured in the story are highly intelligent and are already two steps ahead of you. There is no greater viewing experience than watching intelligent people battling each other with everything they&#039;ve got. <br />
<br />
Another important aspect regarding exposition is that this show has a narrator who is the replacement for expositional characters. The narrator transitions us from one setting to another very concisely and is an integral part of the anime. If it weren’t for this grandfatherly voice we&#039;d be bombarded by the terrible expositional conversations anime is famed for, but thankfully we&#039;re spared that fate.<br />
<br />
Although there is a small irony in the fact that in the last few episodes when the animation is at its best, these tropes of anime that have been disparaged in this review begin to surface. With expositional dialogue and unrestrained character body behaviour beginning to rear its unwanted head. Though it’s not enough to detract, it’s still noticeable considering all of the quality and restraint shown previously. Maybe it’s yet another example of how limitations such as low budget can make creativity flourish through determination, whereas abundancy, such as improved animation in the latter half of this ONA, encourages complacency.<br />
<br />
So Vampire Holmes is not perfect. The animation and art are dated, the plot riddled with small holes that would make an obsessive nitpicker sweat. Some scenarios are diluted or presented in a very simple and convenient fashion that betray the ambition and scope of the series. Religion is painted with a broad stroke and not explored much. Some crime solving tactics and operations are unrealistically achieved with very little complications when so much thought was put into them beforehand.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes simply makes up for all that with pure passion, overriding aesthetics with storytelling and plot holes with historical research. The concept behind the art is solid, the ideas of what the animation attempts to show you are inspired. The plot holes do not negate the story, they can be forgiven for two reasons, the first is that the show is already so full of research and detail that when the viewer spots a periphery hole its almost glaring, and secondly because at the end of the day this is an anime for teens and needs to sacrifice some procedural details for the sake of entertainment given to you at a decent pace.<br />
<br />
Not every little detail needs to be presented to you, because this is entertainment, not a documentary. Except when every detail actually is covered and it is a documentary, but more about that later.<br />
<br />
If we have to choose between sacrificing plot details/art quality or character details, I would like to think most of us would choose to preserve character. Characters drive the story. An entertaining story with flat characters is not going anywhere. We need to emphasise and connect with depictions of human beings to be fully entertained.Vampire Holme&#039;s intelligent characters populate it with so much personality and resolve, so much consistency, there are no clichéd twists and turns from out of nowhere, there are no characters dying and magically coming back to life.<br />
<br />
There is a real emotional current running throughout the main characters’ arcs, a strong bond of friendship, love and camaraderie that is tested to the limits, and it results in very powerful episodes thanks to dozen episodes worth of character development.<br />
<br />
As much as the imperfections mentioned earlier in the review are apparent in the show, they are mostly in the earlier half, but at some point, after the first few episodes, the wrinkles are smoothed out and the occasional moustache-twirling bad guy or belief-stretching plot-point are erased, until that last few episodes where the wrinkles begin to appear again, leaving us mostly with a viewing experience packed with quality storytelling, tension, intrigue and sustained drama. You will rarely ever question the intelligence of characters, groan at their actions; blink in disbelief at their motives. Vampire Holmes stands out from the crowd for its pitch-perfect characterisation and consistent narrative.<br />
<br />
Regarding the art and animation, if you have a problem with sparse architecture, rooms with a handful of chairs and windows, victorian London buildings; crowd scenes that look like something a high school kid produced with pocket-money budget, then you might have a problem with Vampire Holmes. You&#039;d have a problem period, because these flaws are due to budgetary constraints not ineptitude on the art department&#039;s behalf. If that irritates you then you&#039;re not a reasonable person. You will be placated to know that the art and animation increase slightly over the course of the 2 months production.<br />
<br />
A quirk of the budgetary restraints to the animation results in a restrained &#039;performance&#039; by the characters which is much welcomed. Another undesired trope of the anime medium is blatant facial reactions to various types of news, and some of them are naturally still used in this anime, but for the most part the characters in Vampire Holmes don’t overreact as much as other typical anime shows. When a character gives a damning speech for example, his face is static which serves to make him look even more menacing than if the animators went overboard with their tools and made his eyes bulge, irises smaller and veins pop out his head.<br />
<br />
You just have to accept you&#039;re not going to see pioneering animation.<br />
<br />
The gun designs aren’t cool-looking. They&#039;re not sleek pointy colourful as the Dominators in Psycho Pass; they&#039;re ugly pieces of metal with a hole that fires bullets into your face. The design is pretty blatant: crimes aren&#039;t the only thing ugly, the tools employed are also. Millions and millions of humans due to murder crimes, let alone mass genocide. The cost is so high it’s hard to imagine, but the ONA does a good job of reminding you with visceral scenes of terror and misery.<br />
<br />
This crime anime not once glorifies or makes the idea of crimes &#039;cool&#039; at all. For all the talk of the Detective Conan franchise putting a more serious face on crimes in the medium of animation, it still had a kid solving crimes day in day out with funky soundtrack accompanying the scenes. Not to discredit Detective Conan at all, as its always laid a huge burden on its kid protagonist, but in Vampire Holmes there is no subtle or overt undercurrent to the crimes, it is what it is: millions of people dying over and over again, mostly to the impartially beautiful and tragic classical score that the viewer can take one way or the other. That is to say, beautiful or tragic.<br />
<br />
Yoshinobu,Nami and more,Vampire Holmes rarely uses the same piece twice, which is why the Vampire Holmes soundtrack box set is massive. Almost 1 CD a total, a behemoth of classical music, an amazing gateway for newbies to the genre, or a greatest hits for veterans. The ONA&#039;s soundtrack is timeless, much like its story. There are re-used themes and motifs, but every episode will feature a few compositions not used already. The classical nature of the music heightens the story to epic proportions, the premise is monumental and so should its soundtrack be also.<br />
<br />
As for the voice acting, featuring such luminaries as Nobunaga,Yoshinobu and Ayahi, it is a classic cast, accompanied by a classic soundtrack. The ONA excels in audio, even if the visuals don’t.<br />
<br />
There is so much depth that the ONA even has a character read a book about cows.<br />
<br />
Rather than be a gimmick, the opening is actually a validation of many of the show&#039;s quirks, stylistic choices and script decisions made. It provides more context to the story, shedding light on the backdrop of the character backstory, and the fact that we see this since episode 1 is a testament to the fact that the writers of the ONA respect us, the viewer.<br />
<br />
The opening&#039;s content is so full of depth, imagination and epic scope it’s practically an anime in its own right. Indicative of Vampire Holmes, that there are so many story arcs or episodes that other anime would stretch into 25 episode series, but they&#039;re merely window-dressing in this ONA. Not only is the opening one of the best parts of the ONA for its rich depiction of a characters history, but because of how it changes the dynamic of the entire show, bombarding us with new facts and revelations of how these two characters of living came to be. As such, it is placed where it is with very good reason.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes isn’t all serious detectiving and criming, it’s carried by humour all throughout. A type of humour seriously lacking in most anime; that is to say a type of humour that doesn’t rely on slapstick, the breaking of physics, and lurid sex as a topic. The characters in Vampire Holmes are cynicists and realists; their humour is a defiant protest at their situation, the futility of war and all it entails. Vampire Holmes&#039;s humour is largely through dialogue, not sight gags. Vonnegut, Kafka, Heller, these novelists voices are heard in the mouths of many characters, from main protagonists to random police officers, these men are all fed up of dying for no good reason and blow off steam with witty wordplay.<br />
<br />
The entire anime is an in-depth exploration of two characters, approached from every direction imaginable, every context; every situation; the ramifications of crimes, cases,police, religion and media, of legacy, lineage and class. It doesn’t lean heavily on one side or the other; both have their pros and cons when looked at objectively. What’s worse, the story ponders: a corrupt cop or a reformed criminal? There is of course an idealistic current running through the more relatable characters, those who dream of a city with peace and equality, of ridding society of corruption and terror. How to go about it of course is up for debate, usually with guns and crimes.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes is a 2 months saga charting the 2 thousand year battle of humanity with itself, repeating history&#039;s mistakes and endeavours. When a character mentions something that happened 1 episode ago, you actually remember the recalled event, because that’s how long the story is. You feel immersed in it, an invisible comrade; a third wheel standing to the side and reminiscing along with the characters. It’s inexplicable but the ONA gets better the more you watch. Every two or so episodes the quality rises and the storytelling becomes even more addictive.<br />
<br />
There isn’t a single bad episode in the whole run. Not only that, but you never know what to expect either, unlike the vast majority of other anime which have a clear narrative of beats: protagonist starts on A, must get to B, must end up at C. With Vampire Holmes the plot is so rich, the world so vast, the characters so many, you can never predict what people are going to do next, where they&#039;ll end up or what will happen. Vampire Holmes&#039;s depth is unparalleled.<br />
<br />
The saga goes through episode after episode and you feel the weight with each sone, you watch the characters grow together or drift apart, you see setups one episode then pay-offs some episodes later, you see friendships, rivalries, enemies, comrades, battles, love, marriage, birth and death, you see it all. Nothing is left out, absolutely nothing. Other series are just as long, other series have better animation, but no other series is as far-reaching in depth and consistently intelligent and accomplished.<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes is a legend of the anime medium. The greatest anime production in its history.<br />

    Overview:<br />
<br />
The year 2015 has seen a fair number of truly horrible anime released, but no other series have been met with the sheer disdain and critical revulsion of Vampire Holmes. What is this bizarre little series and just why is it SO bad?! Read on if you dare my friends and I will explain!<br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
<br />
The story of Vampire Holmes was adapted from a popular Japanese smartphone game, which should already be setting off red flags that this show is going to suck! Would you ever want to see a movie adaptation of &quot;Flappy Bird&quot; or &quot;Candy Crush&quot;? The basic premise is that there is a

          <span style="display: none;" id="review194015">
        highly incompetent, lazy, and idiotic spoof of Sherlock Holmes simply named &quot;Holmes&quot;. Detective Holmes is accompanied by his assistant &quot;Hudson&quot;, who is of course a goofy parody of Watson. Together our 2 imbeciles must save London from vampires...even though at NO POINT do they ever fight vampires! Instead, every single episode follows the following formula: Holmes acts like a jackass, Hudson grows mildly upset, and the episode ends!<br />
<br />
Art:  0/10<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes actually has the worst looking art I have ever seen in an anime! This looks like something Dingo Studios from Phoenix Games or Video Brinquedo (Brazilian Pixar) would do! To make matters even worse, Holmes looks like a fusion between Sasuke Uchiha and Lelouch vi Britannia, so I want to punch him every second he is on screen!<br />
<br />
Entertainment: 3/10<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes clearly tries to copy the low budget, ultra random humor style of Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer. However, the writing is utter shit and most of the jokes completely fall flat. One thing I must point out though, is that Vampire Holmes the game and anime did MUCH better with Japanese audiences because its humor also borrows heavily from traditional Japanese Manzai style humor. Manzai is a stand-up comedy routine in which puns, double entendre, and biting remarks are rapidly delivered between a straight man called the &quot;Tsukkomi&quot; (Hudson) and the funny man called the &quot;Boke&quot; (Holmes). Many of these puns and double entendre don&#039;t translate well across language barriers, so basically imagine watching Abbott and Costello&#039;s routine &quot;Who&#039;s on First&quot; if you didn&#039;t speak English and you watched a direct German translation. It wouldn&#039;t be funny! <br />
<br />
Overall: 2/10<br />
<br />
Although this IS probably the worst animation I have ever seen in an anime, it is NOT the worst overall anime I have ever seen. Firstly, some moments are actually so stupid they are almost funny. Secondly, it isn&#039;t the show&#039;s fault that I am not a native Japanese speaker, so hating the show because I don&#039;t understand the puns is just as stupid as hating Tatami Galaxy because everyone talks way too fast! I have to realize that I was NOT the intended audience and that alone is not a valid point of criticism against a show. Lastly, there are only 12 episodes at 3 minutes each. This means that a single episode of other equally bad anime like &quot;I Don&#039;t Like You at all Big Brother&quot; waste as much of your time as the entirety of Vampire Holmes. Vampire Holmes knows it is shit and doesn&#039;t really overstay its welcome. You the audience watch in disbelief at the bad animation, perhaps laugh at a few terrible jokes, and then it is all over. Sadly, this is a MUCH better experience than sitting through many horrible anime I have watched. <br />
<br />
TLDR: It isn&#039;t actually deserving of &quot;worst ever&quot; but it is still REALLY bad! Don&#039;t watch it under any circumstances unless you are a masochist or a native Japanese speaker who can actually understand and appreciate the humor!

    Anime is an abbreviation of the word &quot; animation &quot; . Anime is an ANIMATED film or series created in Japan.<br />
<br />
The authors of this &quot;masterpiece&quot; forgot definition what is it anime.<br />
<br />
So first question: Where animators did animation? Paint or maybe GIMP? I don ‘t know but i’m sure  they didn’t spend for this more than 4$. In my opinion animation simply doesn&#039;t exist.<br />
<br />
Ok .Second question. What we have in to this 3 minutes anime?<br />
Op last 30 seocnds and ed last too 30 seconds. Really? Episodes in this series are very short. Why authors made op? They wanted fit in the time slot on TV?<br />
Wonderfull

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186434">
         idea.  But what we get in to this 2 minutes without introduction and ending? The answer is very easy. Absolutely NOTHING! This was supposed to be fun comedy but  (WARING! BIG SPOILER)…   it wasn’t. Their “funny” gags are awful. Jokes are totally terrible and dialogues doesn’t make sens.<br />
<br />
Third question. What is the storyline? …<br />
Error 404: Plot not found. <br />
<br />
Characters:<br />
Stoned detectiv Holmes who explain mysteries, drunk helper called Hudson  and…  Christina...  she or he is a manager of apartament where live Holmes with Hudson.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Op and ed are the same but they are nice and another ost are ok. Overall musick is not bad. Yeah… First plus! And the last.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
No, no, no and again no. If you want to see the worst anime from 2015 year you can watch this but save your time and skip this “anime<br />

    I want to tell you readers a story.<br />
Vampire Holmes has been a strange beast since day 1. After the raw untranslated version was released, no major subbing groups heeded the call. <br />
However, Last-Subs did.<br />
Last-Subs, a mysterious and intriguing group, published their subs on nyaa when nobody else did. Not as a video release, with the subs placed over the already-existing raws, but just as a .ass file. If you wanted to watch with their subs, you had to do it yourself, downloading a raw and then adding the .ass file in afterwards.<br />
And boy, was it worth it!<br />
Last-Subs may very well have been made by putting

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190957">
        the script into Google Translate. It&#039;s that level of terrible, so bad that it&#039;s amazing. The first 2 episodes alone contain such great lines as:<br />
<br />
&quot;The only people who use the floor as a bed are the losers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ate recently, in addition has to work because we are bankrupt.&quot;<br />
&quot;This very seriously.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn, my face is fused to the bedroom floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The actual show itself is terribly uninteresting and low-quality, but Last-Subs made it totally worth watching. I was laughing my ass off for those glorious 2 minutes and then looked forwards to next week&#039;s release. I&#039;d rate those episodes as 10s.<br />
But after episode 3, Last-Subs went strangely silent. There were no more fansubbing groups for the show. I practically gave up. Then I learned that viewster hosts the show&#039;s official release. With actual coherent subs, the show lost all of its joy and meaning. I held off, then watched episodes 4-12 in one day (The whole series only takes 24 minutes). It was a pretty miserable experience, and the &quot;Vampire&quot; part of &quot;Vampire Holmes&quot; was entirely nonexistent. I&#039;d rate those episodes as 1. <br />
<br />
Taking all of this into account, I found the average score of the show through its individual episodes. 10+10+10+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 / 12 = 3.25, rounded down to 3.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, definitely watch the Last-Subs versions of the early episodes, and you can safely ignore the rest.

    Okay, first of all, English is not my mother language* . <br />
Vampire Holmes... If I could say my thoughts in just one word while watching this show it would be: dafuq. <br />
<br />
Story: 1/10<br />
The story is about what? Where&#039;s the mystery? I can&#039;t really say anything about something that doesn&#039;t even exists. <br />
<br />
Art: 1/10<br />
Really, everyone can draw better things on paint.<br />
<br />
Sound: 4/10<br />
The opening and ending song is catchy, but they could give another song for the ending.<br />
<br />
Character: 1/10<br />
Holmes is a vampire?! <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
I&#039;m always laughing while I&#039;m watching this. Not because it is good, but it&#039;s funny how bad is.<br />
<br />
Overall: 1/10<br />
I wasted 9 minutes of my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review186600">
        life with this crap. Dropped. <br />

    This is a mix of Manga screen caps, Came play footage and children&#039;s bad drawings. There is no story to the episodes as they are only 3 minutes long each, the opening and ending take up half of that type. This is just a pathetic anime through and through.

    This was a work of art (Except for the art). Everything about this anime was outstanding (Except for the art).<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes was an amazing anime to watch. It was so much different than most others that I watched. This anime stands out to me. It&#039;s brilliance comes from the great animation (I know I said the art wasn&#039;t good, it wasn&#039;t. But that&#039;s exactly why it was so good) as well as the REALLY &#039;good&#039; story. The completely ACCURATE subbing may have as well played a large role in my enjoyment. <br />
<br />
Throughout my approximately 10mins I was laughing hard enough to spew blood. The characters

          <span style="display: none;" id="review189941">
        are so retarded they are amazing. I just couldn&#039;t believe it actually passed for anime. When I finished watching an episode I would find myself wondering if they understood what they were even doing while they were making this anime. I mean, they did a great job and all. They sure got me to laugh heh heh heh. Though really, this anime is the worst thing I have ever watched that was considered anime.<br />
<br />
I was honestly devastated when they dropped this series. How could they drop something so amazing, it was doing so... well... <br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes is something that I would like to see bested it terms of crappiness. I am still giving this 10/10 though. If you like things because they suck then this is the anime for you. Especially if you get the subbing group that makes the BEST sense (Best because no sense is better).

    WARNING: THE SUBS FOR THIS ANIME ARE HORRID!<br />
I just finished watching a ONA which had 5-minute episodes, and I really liked the duration. So I searched for new series which had short episodes and ran into Vampire Holmes. <br />
First of all, most of the reviews in this page are useless. You MUST watch ALL of the episodes to know the story of this... thing. Watching 4 or 5 episodes or even 10 is not enough. I do not consider that a good thing though.<br />
There are a lot of joke reviews for this, but I&#039;m deadly serious.<br />
<br />
STORY: 5/10<br />
I&#039;ll start by saying that this anime doesn&#039;t even

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190838">
        follow the synopsis it has. Holmes NEVER searches for vampires, he is not a vampire either, he doesn&#039;t work with the Metropolitan Police of London or nothing like that. I really can&#039;t understand why did the studio give that synopsis if it&#039;s completely made up. <br />
So the story is about Holmes, a lazy bum who yells at Hudson while sitting all day in a couch. Or the floor. Or whatever. He never does nothing, even though Hudson constantly brings him cases, he just gives up after 30 seconds. He even likes to tell REALLY bad jokes at any time imaginable. Also a weird talking cat called Kira appears all of a sudden in some random episode without a reason.<br />
                               --SPOILERS--<br />
<br />
<br />
But in reality, Holmes is an incredibly well disguised dark-mage, super intelligent man who can solve 4 cases at the same time. WTF. I seriously believed it all the way through the series. At least this is well done.<br />
This is when I talk about when I say you must watch all the episodes. The watcher doesn&#039;t have even a hint of this until the 11th episode. Why? It&#039;s another mystery.<br />
<br />
ART: 1/10<br />
Wow, this is bad. I think it killed my eyes. Even I can do a better job. I understand that this is a supposedly an adaptation of a smartphone game, but that isn&#039;t even a poor excuse. It&#039;s so poorly drawn... I think it has the same 4 frames for each character. God, it&#039;s so bad I can&#039;t find words to describe it.<br />
<br />
SOUND: 5/10<br />
OP and ED are the same and is surprisingly good! I&#039;ts playing in my head all the time, I don&#039;t know what happened. Apart from that, there is no music or anything, just the same weird sound effects for every episode.<br />
And talking about the opening, I wonder why starting from the 7th episode the opening has some random sound effects in the back? What do they mean?<br />
<br />
CHARACTER: 4/10<br />
If you ask me who Hudson is, well... I don&#039;t have the slightest idea. Vampire Holmes just centers in Holmes even though (I consider) Hudson is the MC. I don&#039;t know exactly what Kira is either, but I don&#039;t think I want to know. Besides this, Holmes is has a decent story.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT: 8/10<br />
Something above from 5! This is advancing. I don&#039;t know why, but this is SO bad that I just had to watch it. Every time an episode came out I just felt the necessity to watch this. I don&#039;t know, I think I wanted to know if this was going to follow a story. But I really enjoyed it for some reason.<br />
I think I&#039;ve gone crazy. Please don&#039;t judge me.<br />
<br />
OVERALL: 4/10<br />
-You have to watch all of the episodes to know the story.<br />
-The synopsis is a lie.<br />
-The animation is SO BAD it hurts.<br />
-I want to punch Hudson in the face.<br />
-The OP is good and catchy.<br />
-It has a pretty decent voice acting.<br />
-It&#039;s so bad, it&#039;s funny.<br />
 <br />
Don&#039;t take this series too seriously. Millawls&#039; review said in the enjoyment section &quot;I&#039;m just enjoying the glorious train wreck.&quot; and it&#039;s the same for me. If you have time to kill, watch it, it&#039;s 24 minutes long and decent, but just for the ending. I just hope new short-episode ONAs start the next season.

    Vampire Holmes<br />
<br />
Peak anime. The greatest show ever created. A lucious meal filled with every delectable dish you could ever imagine. That’s what comes to mind whenever my brain gives me the pleasure of thinking about Vampire Holmes. More wondrous thoughts have never graced the mind of an individual; if anyone rates Vampire anything below an undoubted and indisputed masterpiece, I will personally find them to torture them in any way imaginable, from extracting nails to psychological vengeance. If I had to go even one day without the orgasm-inducing flawlessly produced expertly woven story of philosophical depth that Vampire Holmes is, I would baja blast my

          <span style="display: none;" id="review406782">
        brain out.<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
What is there not to like? Holmes likely has the greatest and most profound development I’ve ever witnessed. He begins as a cowardly and unsuccessful detective, riddled with the struggles of life and living alone in a dilapidated mansion. By the end he is an inspiring hero, his glory rivaling that of Norse gods. He is cool, calm, and calculated, every movement meticulous and purposeful. Even so, Holmes is still a caring character. If anyone ever was carved out to be an exemplary man, it’s Holmes. For example, in Episode 7, he shows his compassion to the sickening and brutal robber, a man thought to be irredeemable, by diffusing a stressful situation with his kindness and brilliant mind. He could have easily shot the abhorrent and loathsome bandit, but with quick thinking and even quicker sleight of hand, Holmes expertly managed to switch his real gun to a play one, effectively saving his loving partner as well as giving the scum of the earth robber another chance. The man reminiscent of 6ix9ine was almost certainly able to turn his life of crime around and learn to work hard to support his struggling family, all because of Holmes&#039; compassionate character. Holmes is a man of extraordinary wisdom and knowledge, a man of perfect understanding, a man of goodness itself personified. Although he is obviously the greatest human to have ever lived, he is still exceptionally relatable because of the incredibly realistic struggles he has to face. Holmes is a character marred by life, but he always emerges victorious, which is the true joy of watching his character. Hudson, the other major protagonist, is also amazing. His undying devotion to Holmes even when he’s going through terrible circumstances is undoubtedly heartwarming; he is the perfect partner for Holmes. Hudson brings a whole new perspective to Holmes’ life, and he is certainly entertaining to watch. Also, the wonderfully woven subplot of romance between him and Christina is potentially the greatest romance I have ever witnessed; I must admit, I cried multiple times. The characters of Vampire Holmes are spectacular examples of what realistic and emotionally moving characters can be, I am absolutely blown away. 10/10<br />
<br />
Plot<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes’ plot proves to be just as awe-worthy as the characters are. The pacing is superb, action and tension await at every turn but space is still left for deeply emotional moments that are often tear inducing. The amount of content that fits into 36 minutes of screentime is absolutely mindblowing. Although a third of the show consists of the OP, no content is lost within a useless song. In my opinion the OP may be the strongest aspect in the entire show. Symbolic attributes woven together with intricate and thought provoking themes allow the OP to be the crowning element of the show. The phrase “everlasting love” is played a total of 48 times in the OP, indicating how important it really is. This phrase can symbolize a multitude of things. For example, it could be a reference to the epic romance of Hudson and Christina, or Hudson’s undying loyalty and love towards Holmes. Also, it could exemplify how compassionate Holmes is. “Everlasting love” is the perfect phrase to describe how much I enjoy this series, and the extreme depth and weight it adds to this show is worthy of rejoicing. That being said, it shouldn’t detract from how incredible the rest of the show is. Vampire Holmes has the number one spot on my list of astounding plots, as it manages to merge multiple genres into one thrilling ride of action, betrayal, love, drama, horror, romance, friendship, gore, cleanliness, torture, glory, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, atheism, cool stuff, more cool stuff, really cool stuff, extremely cool stuff, the coolest stuff, everlasting love, romance, love, kindness, romance and love, everlasting love, nudity, PG, Attack on Titan, One Piece, Death Note, dogs, Clannad, some more cool stuff, and shit. Basically, Vampire Holmes is the best part of anything. No matter who you are, it’s guaranteed that you will get something out of Vampire Holmes. The plot is a perfect shell of chocolate, surrounding every character to push them to evolve and develop in the face of adversity and to encapsulate exemplary cinema concisely and creatively. 10/10<br />
<br />
Themes<br />
<br />
Now we get to the deepest part of the show. Vampire Holmes proves to be even more thought provoking than shows such as Monster, and the terrific tapestry of tangible yet tumultuous themes that this show displays is undeniably a masterpiece. The deep philosophical topics will topple any obstacles you had in your mind regarding life and will provide optimal content for contemplation; it’s chock-full of thoughtful elements and void of any plotholes. After I finished, I was in a trance-like state for almost a month straight, simply because it was too deep. My life was completely altered; I found myself in much happier place and was able to turn my life completely around because this show was so amazing and perfect wow I cannot believe how much of an impact it had my thoughts are divulging into terror and exultation I have reached a new plain of understanding I am now a higher being who has transcended time and space to become the ultimate vampire detective compassionate like Holmez yet still only a studen my listlesss works spill fruitlessly from my lip as an unheaded recommennation to wach Vampire Holmes I am a proVHet listen to my woVHs ignorant chVHdren of the eVHVH we are all deVHVHd to die we must worship worship worship we bVHVHe because the alternativejsjs is to live in fear and the unknown is terrifyingsjwiis VAMPIRE HOLMES is our Godsjakoa we believesjsksn that we will see jssmshshhshsh Holmes with Hudson on his rightndksoskddndndndHSOWKENOEPWPLVHVHVHVHVHVHVHVHVH!!!!??!!92926302029!?VH<br />

    half of the people who wrote a review for vampire holmes ironically praised it for being a revolutionary masterpiece to the industry, which somehow got pretty old, don&#039;t you agree? and let&#039;s be real, that kind of thing never really WAS funny.<br />
<br />
the other half consists out of seemingly endless reasoning as to why it&#039;s a pretty bad show, allow me to congratulate all of you. partly for lacking the playfulness to approach this show with sarcasm like the rest did, but mainly for mistaking said lack for logic and the ability to criticise. like there is any point in possessing all of these characteristics when

          <span style="display: none;" id="review190627">
        even my baby brother would know that this show is total bs. there is no other way but to say negative things about vampire holmes. once again, thanks for pointing out the obvious.<br />
<br />
for now, i don&#039;t see any point in discussing the features of the show. the story is bad, the characters are bad, the art and animation are totally horrible and the only reason for you to watch this show would be that you either hate yourself or you are able to regard this subject as entertainment matter, because let&#039;s be real you can do nothing but laugh about this. anyways, the people who watch this and seriously EXPECT SOMETHING before being met with utter disappointment; why did you even watch this show. and why do you complain. we get it, its a bad show, we all know that by now. but why is there still. a serious review about this. on my main screen. every day. please tell me ya&#039;ll have better things to do.

    Vampire Holmes is an anime that honestly has nothing going for it. I decided since this show was short I might as well give it a shot, and my god did I waste my mere 36 minutes watching this show.  Though it does have a few funny moments(very rarely)it brings nothing new to the table. <br />
<br />
(Story) 3<br />
With every new episode connecting to the same premise, it may as well be a cartoon. Granted, it did have continuity, but it was very sparse. The story was very poorly written at that, as all they focused on was well...comedy! The continuity is the ONLY thing keeping

          <span style="display: none;" id="review223652">
        this from getting a 2 or lower.<br />
<br />
(Art) 4<br />
Meh, the art is nothing special. but it&#039;s something that I quite liked in the cover image. The art style was weird but the character Holmes himself looked a little cool. However, the animation was terrible and the art had a lot of chibi at times. <br />
<br />
(Sound) 4<br />
Yes, the voice actors were okay. I don&#039;t hate any anime voice actors, or voice actors in general to be honest. But the one thing that ruins the sound in this anime, is the subtitles. With greatly translated lines such as &quot;It opened alone!&quot; I wouldn&#039;t recommend watching it with subs if you speak Japanese, especially if you&#039;re learning english. The theme song was the best part of the show in my opinion, as it was actually kind of good. I&#039;ve heard hundreds of anime themes and this one might not be the worst I&#039;ve heard.<br />
<br />
(Character) 1<br />
The characters in this show had no real purpose and were trying too to be professional and weird at the same time. They were only there so the show has characters. Granted, the two main characters are meh, but there are very few other characters. Though the design for Holmes was kind of cool, his personality didn&#039;t fit his design. Although, I feel that&#039;s what they were going for but it just feels out of place.<br />
<br />
(Enjoyment) 1<br />
Never before has an anime made my stomach hurt like this. This show was so bad that my head and stomach both hurt after watching this. And it took a little while for the pain to go away too, mind you. As I watched this series my rating for it slowly got lower and lower until I ended up rating it a 1/10. I could barely sit through each episode, and remember being worried or in agony as I was on episode 5 out of the twelve. I just wanted the pain to stop.<br />
<br />
(Overall) 3<br />
This series was a bad experience, and something I plan to never watch again. If you want a good show and like vampires without continuity, you should just stick with a cartoon. <br />

    I&#039;m going to be honest here, this anime was BAD. <br />
I kinda liked it though sad to say.<br />
Why the hell do i like this shit? i asked my self.<br />
my response is because of how randomly terrible it was.<br />
<br />
Vampire holmes might be the 2015 pupa, because its terrible with 12 short episodes. But as i say i kinda like this, i watched it because i found it&#039;s comedy hilarious. Yes the comedy was random and made no sense but i was laughing and questioning why. but rather than what i laughed at this anime was terrible. for one thing everything was half-assed. and had very little

          <span style="display: none;" id="review196957">
        animation even to the point where you dont know if it&#039;s made with the MMD program. the opening was OK to listen to because it wasnt ear rape. but chances are if you&#039;re reading this and you want to see this anime, don&#039;t unless you like random comedy. but chances are you will really hate this anime. but if you ask me about my feelings on it this is what i think.<br />
&quot;It&#039;s fucking terrible but has me laughing&quot;

    Watch this if you want more self-esteem in your own animation skills.<br />
<br />
Seriously, take out paint tool sai and windows movie maker, and make an episode of something for 3 minutes, just think up the plot as you go. Now watch this anime. <br />
Now BOOM, you are instantly a pro ready for a job in the real world.<br />
I swar a middle schooler (who loves shoujo manga a little too much) made this, despite what the credits are telling me. How did a group of people make this and not ONE of them was like &#039;hey, guys, I think this is kind of a bad idea&#039; <br />
<br />
Story--

        1/10<br />
They&#039;re looking for a creepy looking doggy<br />
<br />
Art-- 1/10<br />
I&#039;m not sure which art style I should grade this on, because there literally is 3 different art styles (chibi, sketchy, shoujo),<br />
 4 if you count the opening that I am certain is made on mikumikudance.<br />
 <br />
Sound-- 1/10<br />
It goes between having no sound, to  a few random<br />
 sound effects that I swear are from sailor moon.<br />
<br />
Character-- 1/10<br />
Sherlock Holmes is a vampire and Watson is... well, watson.<br />
Enjoyment-- 10/10<br />
This should go in the goddamn congressional vault to show future generations<br />
 what we have has done to the world.<br />
<br />
Overall-- 1/10<br />
I recommended this anime to my friend who loves Sherlock.<br />
I am anticipating getting yelled at back.

    As I continue on my quest to watch infamous bad anime, I came across a title known as &quot;Vampire Holmes&quot;. Hilariously, this is the most dropped anime on MAL, even though it shouldn&#039;t take you more than a half hour to an hour to watch. Even the fansub group that was subbing it dropped it after the third episode.<br />
<br />
But what is it exactly that makes Vampire Holmes so bad? This was a question I could not resist finding the answers to.<br />
<br />
STORY (3/10):<br />
<br />
The synopsis to Vampire Holmes is pretty useless, as for the majority of the series nothing happens. Every episode tends to go something like

          <span style="display: none;" id="review208793">
        this:<br />
<br />
Hudson: Holmes let&#039;s do detective stuff<br />
Holmes: Nah, *irrelevant bullshit*<br />
*rest of the episode will be about irrelevant bullshit*<br />
<br />
You might be thinking, &quot;Oh, I like slice of life anime a lot, maybe I&#039;ll like this.&quot; No...no, you won&#039;t. <br />
<br />
ART (3/10):<br />
<br />
I can&#039;t figure out what Vampire Holmes was animated in (MikuMikuDance? GoAnimate? A mixture?), but it certainly wasn&#039;t any high-tech technology. There are animations on Newgrounds that look better then this. The show also has a ton of reused footages and frames.<br />
<br />
SOUND (3/10):<br />
<br />
Hudson has a whiny, annoying voice, Holmes sounds about average, and the music is meh. On a side note, you are better off going with the official Viewster subs for this one; even if they aren&#039;t great, the three episodes that were fansubbed were obviously put through Google Translate. There are maybe three coherent sentences over the course of those three episodes.<br />
<br />
(Makes you wonder why the fansub group even bothered dropping it. Saved them a whole five minutes each week putting 2 minutes of material through Google Translate.)<br />
<br />
However, even in the official subs, Vampire Holmes&#039; &quot;humor&quot; comes off like it was constructed by a preschooler. Every joke has a confusing setup then goes right to a stale punchline.<br />
<br />
CHARACTER (3/10):<br />
<br />
Vampire Holmes lacks the time for any of its characters to receive any kind of development. I didn&#039;t care for either Hudson or Holmes. I kinda liked the cat.<br />
<br />
ENJOYMENT (3/10):<br />
<br />
Eh...I enjoyed this ever-so-slightly-more then another short vampire anime I put myself through (Diabolik Lovers).<br />
<br />
OVERALL (3/10):<br />
<br />
Are you a legitimate vampire fan looking for a quality anime with an entertaining representation of the genre? Run in the opposite direction immediately.<br />
<br />
Do you like comedy? This is not for you.<br />
<br />
Do you like the supernatural? This is not for you.<br />
<br />
Do you like bad anime? This is probably for you.<br />
<br />
Are you stoned and have you seen every other anime you could enjoy while stoned? Are you sure? I dunno, maybe watch Vampire Holmes? Or go bake some cookies. You&#039;ll probably regret that less tomorrow.

    I don&#039;t really write reviews on this site anymore. Reviews were something I wrote back when I was a kid. But this series... left such a bad taste in my mouth that I felt I had to break my silence.<br />
<br />
As a HUGE fan of the ORIGINAL, Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes series of novels, this is absolutely disgusting and even downright offensive. I don&#039;t understand the existence of this anime. Even at only 3 minutes an episode, I couldn&#039;t even bring myself to continue on with the rest of the series because each episode enrages me more than the last. Everyone who worked on this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review270091">
        anime should be ashamed of themselves. This has transcended trash. This is so vile and repulsive and even downright nauseating that eating straight up shit sounds appealing. Maybe, had they named this something else, I wouldn&#039;t be so offended. But the fact that he is a detective with the name Holmes and his assistant Hudson vaguely sounds like Watson Is just jglkdsjgkjdhsg GRAAAA. I cannot even translate my rage and disgust into words anymore.<br />
<br />
Why does MAL not have a 0 or -9000 rating number again? I desperately need it.

    What is this? Seriously! What is this? I could not bear to watch 4 episodes. When your series makes me drop it 4 episodes in, you are setting yourself up for utter destruction. Not a single redeeming quality comes from this &quot;anime&quot; if you can call it that. The OP is deceptive in every sense of the word because you are seeing things that are not in the actual series. Whatever, let&#039;s get this over with.<br />
Plot: (1 out of 10)<br />
What plot? All you got is unfunny jokes. This is suppose to be something about Holmes and Vampires. Guess what? That is a lie.<br />
Characters: (1 out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review241322">
        of 10)<br />
Your looking for Holmes? Sorry, no. There is only failed comedians called our characters. Holmes and Hudson have no character other than make unfunny gags and doing random stuff (Holmes eating a cake). <br />
Art&amp; Animation: (1 out of 10)<br />
What I see here is abysmal animation that would make Dragon Ball Super&#039;s animation look decent. The character designs are bland and of course chibi characters are blended in. If this anime is cel-shading, then it fails miserably. The frame rate and composite shots are horrendous beyond belief.<br />
Sound (2 out 10)<br />
The OP is decent even though it is deceptive. The voice acting is pretty bad. I don&#039;t care about the other areas of sound because the animation is terrible.<br />
Overall (1 out of 10)<br />
I don&#039;t recommend it to anyone because it is a waste of time. <br />

    Okay, we just seen the first problem, that is the ugliest flash animation i&#039;ve ever seen, but  you have to stuff as much of the series episode in as possible and execute it within a couple of minutes you have Vampire Holmes, who just a whopping skip over 50-seconds and tend to consist of our detective heroes doing something random while resolving mysteries. And they try to be about funny as a Taiwanese accountant&#039;s textbook note, but that feeling you have of being cheated out of 8 seconds of your life, That&#039;s the feeling a average person can get with Vampire Holmes!

    The Vampire Holmes anime is a pretty obvious advertisement, and it&#039;s not even that good of an advertisement. Made to promote a mystery smartphone game developed by Cucuri for iOS and Android devices, the plot follows Detective Holmes, and his assistant Hudson, as both of them solve a case given to them by the Metropolitan Police of London.<br />
<br />
While the plot is basic, it is enough to get a mystery mobile game rolling. And you&#039;d think that a short anime used to advertise said mobile game, it could lead into the games plot as some sort of prelude, or maybe be an adaptation of a small

          <span style="display: none;" id="review286934">
        part of the plot from right at the beginning, but it isn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
In the anime, Holmes is given a case to solve, but we don&#039;t see him solve any of it. Oh, he does solve the case that was given to him, you just don&#039;t see any of the actual detective work, with the anime instead focusing on all of the in between bits that you wouldn&#039;t want to actually see. This was probably done because of extreme budget and time constraints, but it makes the entire series frustrating to sit through. Which you wouldn&#039;t think is a problem with how short the whole thing is.<br />
<br />
Each episode is only 3 minutes, and with 12 episodes, that&#039;s a total of 36 minutes to work with. While not a lot of time, it could have been used to solve a smaller case. Or tease the plot of the game like i mentioned earlier. But instead, the whole series is Holmes and Hudson spending most of their time not solving the case and arguing about not solving the case.<br />
<br />
The whole plot gets solved off screen. What we get instead is slapstick involving a loud and annoying landlady who continually hassles Holmes for rent, and Holmes&#039;s pet, a mysterious cat named Kira, who is more than it seems, and not much else.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about it&#039;s measly 3 minute time limit is that a significant chunk of each episode is the opening and closing credits. So the series went from having about 36 minutes of time to work with, to less than 15. Did a series like this need an OP and ED around the same length as a regular series?<br />
<br />
The Vampire Holmes anime isn&#039;t really worth watching, unless you need something quick and easy to digest during a lunch break. And even then, there are quite a few other anime that you could watch instead of this, such as Detroit Metal City, Inferno Cop, and the Lucky Star spin-off Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku. Even the McDonald&#039;s advertising campaign (the Join The Crew campaign), about the girl who becomes the boss of her own McDonalds, is a step up from this.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you speak Japanese fluently, or even read Japanese really well, you could probably go check out the game instead. At least you&#039;ll be solving a mystery.
