    Creativity, a simple word that inspires so much innovative ideas from anyone, anywhere, anytime. What inspires creativity varies but for a young boy named Toshinari Seki, he takes it to astronomical levels that goes far beyond what you may be used to seeing at school. As a master of killing time, Seki lives up his reputation of such a title. For a  7-minute anime series, there’s so much attention Seki can attract towards its audience.<br />
<br />
When it comes to killing time, you would do something inventive, something creative, or anything that will prevent you from saying along the lines of ‘it’s so boring, there’s nothing

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144503">
        to do’. For Seki, there’s a chance for that in his class every single day because he sits in the very back corner. As a kid of his age, Seki can be described as a simple yet curious character. He isn’t very interested in his studies by the way he behaves in class. Looking it from an intrinsic perspective, Seki is an average boy with nothing that stands out with his character or personality. Rather, he prefers to be alone by his activities. Of course, that’s perfectly normal because kids his age are growing up and build their characters. Seki is also more of the shy boy with his lack of dialogues. More often or not, he communicates using body language (gestures, signals, etc) that somehow makes its point. Rather than being intellectual, this series takes Seki and presents him as a bizarre yet likable character with his actions.<br />
<br />
Then, we have Rumi Yokoi, the not-so-fortunate girl sitting next to Seki. Similar to Seki, she is the typical average girl without the glorifying looks or an abnormal personality. Yet, she is similar in some ways to Seki as characterized by her curiosity. Despite trying to ignore Seki’s actions in class, she often finds herself unable to but instead entranced by his activities. It’s humorous in many ways because almost everything that Seki does tends to draw her attention. At the same time, Yokoi often gets into trouble by the teacher and mistakenly being labeled as a troublemaker. For Yokoi, it becomes a chore for her every class period to deal with Seki. On some instances, she seems to tolerate or even embrace Seki’s culture. Other times, she overestimates Seki’s intentions that results into a scolding by the adults. There’s a lot of anxiety each episode seeing Yokoi and her reactions towards how she perceives Seki in class. Furthermore, it’s surprisingly noticeable to see her character develop. This is evidenced as Yokoi seemingly grows stronger with every class period or episode. She is able to resist some her curiosity or even close to stopping Seki from goofing off in class. Unfortunately, she never seems to reach home base with her goals because time is simply not her side.<br />
<br />
The series adapts itself in an episodic format. Given its average 7-8 minute standard, viewers should not expect an engaging linear story saturated with complexity. Instead, do expect a slice of life story featuring Seki as he kills time in his boring class. What you might not expect is the activities he does in class when the teacher is not looking. Some of them might seem typical while others are not. Examples including bring live animals, performing experiments, and in general any activities that would earn you a trip to the principal’s office if caught. The humorous part is that Seki NEVER gets caught. Throughout the series, it is Yokoi that becomes the collateral damage because of Seki’s innovations. Not only that but no one believes a word she says. It aims at the purpose to appeal to the audience that the adults of this show are useless and self-insufficient. If every student could get away with Seki’s behavior, then nothing would ever be learned. But as an experimental show, Seki’s activities encourages creativity and even inspiration. It’s clear that the boy is intelligent because some of the games he engages in are fundamentally impossible, at least in realistic levels such as mixing chess and shogi on the same board. For Yokoi, she often formulates imaginations and delusions at her own discretions from the way Seki kills time.<br />
<br />
As a show of weird quirks, there are occasionally some characters that comes into the scenes to bring a little normalcy. I don’t classify them as supporting characters since most of them tend to enter and exit after the period/episode is over. Yet, there is one other character that is worth noting. Her name is Goto and like most girls her age is interested in relationships rather than her education. Make no mistake, her delusions can be as zany as Yokoi in class. Rather than being curious at Seki’s ingenious games, she is more interested in their “relationship”. This is in quotation marks because Seki and Yokoi are not dating. Yet, there are people that thinks they are dating for bizarre reasons. Further evidenced are some hints that Yokoi might see Seki as more than just a classmate. However, the show focuses more on its comedy and less so on a Romeo &amp; Juliet story.<br />
<br />
Of all the silliness that the show brings in, it’s all presented as simplistic. It’s not realistic with some of Yokoi’s games that seems unconventional. Yet, they are practical and influences Yokoi’s school life at various levels. The story itself is rather too simple and may seems repetitive. Yokoi getting accused of being a troublemaker in class can also seem bizarre considering girls are often the ones that are more peaceful. Not only that but she doesn’t understand Seki’s purpose which is also a bit of an overstatement. We might never understand Seki’s purpose beyond the simple idea of ‘killing time’. The lack of character backgrounds such as their childhoods being explored also becomes a drawback. Finally, the humor of this show might not appeal to everyone. In essence, it’s a comedy show that inspires laughter but not everyone may get used to Seki’s quirky activities in class.<br />
<br />
Both artwork and soundtrack are consistent with this short series. In essence, they are simple and down to earth. The classroom backgrounds is straight point forward with nothing particular that stands out. It’s probably best to just call it ‘just there’ because Seki’s activities are what draws in the audience and his classmate. The character designs also seems normal except maybe some slightly physical aspects for Yokoi. In retrospect, we don’t see a girl with white hair often in class that goes unnoticed. On the other hand, the soundtrack is very noticeable for both its OP and ED songs with slightly edited changes throughout the show. Instrumentally, it has a melodious tone with comical backgrounds. We see both main characters in the songs as they demonstrate degrees of humor. The ED song features Seki playing an instrument to create the style that Tonari-Seki Kun accomplishes – innovational humor. Kana Hanazawa plays the role of Yokoi with her nervous yet curious voice mannerisms. It matches well since she is specialized in voicing girls of shy characters. On the other hand, Seki’s voice is hardly ever heard throughout the series. His body language does the talking.<br />
<br />
7 minutes. That’s all it takes to draw in as much as attention for Seki towards an audience. There’s no need for a deep engaging story because shows like this should be presented with simplicity. While the activities that Seki performs can be complex, it’s easy to see what the show tries to accomplish. And that goal was achieved by bringing in humor in a different way that what you may be used to. No absurd fan service. No shock values. No crude humor. Rather, it’s a show that breaks down the barriers of a normal school life. Now, that’s a certain kind of fun.<br />

    WARNING: Avoid drinking anything while watching. This show is not liable for any snorting of said drink. Side effects may include stomach aches from giggle-fits and shortness of breath...<br />
<br />
Story: 8/10 There is a special charm that only short anime possess, such as Hetalia, Chi&#039;s Sweet Home and Miss Monochrome. Among these easy-to-watch shows is Tonari no Seki-kun, whose episodes are a mere 7 minutes in length. Each segment is episodic without much of an overlying plot, although there are recurring themes. A creative boy named Seki-kun brings in nick-nacks to class and messes around with them rather than pay attention. Yokoi-san, the girl who sits

          <span style="display: none;" id="review150709">
        next to him, reluctantly gets drawn into his activities. Her inner monologue of observations explain his schemes and give significance to small changes. Sitting at the very back of the classroom, the other students and teachers take no notice of whatever dramatic occurrence is taking place; when they do, it usually takes form in some misunderstanding. Much to her chagrin, Seki-kun never gets caught, while Yokoi manages to get in trouble instead. The fact that the two take each situation so seriously only amps up the amusement.<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10 There is nothing very special about the animation, except for when it focuses on the games. The art does justice to Seki-kun&#039;s elaborate hobbies. The colors are light and happy, and the expressions of the characters take form in comedic ways. The only noteworthy character design is Yokoi, who sports white hair and a candy-colored girl&#039;s school uniform. The more detailed manga panels translate cleanly in the adaption. Overall, the simple style works wonders for the anime&#039;s simple premise.<br />
<br />
Sound: 8/10 The opening is sung by the voice actor of Yokoi, and it&#039;s basically her general reactions to Seki-kun&#039;s antics. The frantic stream of thought within each verse is sung in one breath, and the fast paced vocals are complimented by lighthearted music. I have never once thought of skipping it. The ending is also addictive, with Seki-kun drumming on his pencil cases and school supplies.<br />
<br />
Seki-kun never speaks, so you won&#039;t hear much of the seiyuu except for occasional grunts or laughter. Yokoi, on the other hand, is the prominent narrator. Kana Hanazawa does a wonderful job portraying Yokoi, but I did find her voice to be slightly annoying. It&#039;s a teeny-tiny mar to the overall execution.<br />
<br />
Character: 8/10 You really wonder why a genius like Seki-kun doesn&#039;t put his talents and energy into other skills rather than waste time. The audience quickly sympathizes with Yokoi&#039;s plight, but like her, are drawn into every game. As the series progresses, we see that Yokoi starts to become more and more involved with Seki-kun&#039;s various distractions. This however would be the extent of any character development. I fell in love with this adorable duo almost instantly and I&#039;d like the anime to speak for itself. Supporting characters have a tiny role, but they are amusing additions to the plot nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 9/10 This could potentially be the best comedy of the season, no joke. I&#039;m really grateful to my little brother who introduced me to Tonari no Seki-kun. I&#039;d definitely use some of the nifty ideas to pass time myself if I didn&#039;t get caught. Anyone who can pull off the antics should have the right to wear a T-shirt that says &quot;Seki-kun like a boss.&quot; The style of humor is somewhat similar to that found in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star. I swear, it&#039;ll brighten up your entire day =D<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10 Oh gosh, I&#039;ve started rambling. Anyway - I totally recommend this (especially to younger demographics and people who haven&#039;t seen anime before) if your looking for something family-friendly. It&#039;s an automatic favorite. Thank you for reading this review and happy laughing.

    The amount of joy that you can get out of a pleasantly mellow 7 minute slice-of-life is incredible.<br />
<br />
Story - Is so simple it hurts. How do you make a 7 minute anime about a school slice-of-life so good?  Yokoi is a girl that slightly stands out from the rest of her class. She always wants to study hard and do her best every day. The boy who sits next to her creates new ways to kill time which distracts her to her utmost limits.<br />
<br />
Art - The art isn&#039;t anything to write home about. It&#039;s average at best. Maybe that works incredible well for this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review136899">
        anime though. Nothing stands out, but everything is drawn really well. Not to mention the craziness they incorporate in Seki&#039;s every day antics makes it worth more on the scale.<br />
<br />
Sound - The opening isn&#039;t to bad. The ending theme is where it&#039;s at though. It&#039;s unique and the drumming on the metal instruments on Seki&#039;s desk and Yokoi getting into his beat and feeling embarrassed about it. I&#039;d also like to point out Seki having no Seiyuu.<br />
<br />
Character - The development for the character is lacking. But, they make up for this in developing the characters in 7 minutes every episode to show what this anime is truly about. Seki has no Seiyuu. He portrays his feelings through emotions that are pretty easy to read. Yokoi on the other hand is a normal girl who gets distracted at every turn with Seki. She has a cute voice and can be a bit Yandere when Seki starts ruining the imagination that plays out in her head with his certain shenanigans. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment - Incredible. I enjoy start to finish of this 7 minute an episode anime. It&#039;s just long enough and keeps me laughing through out. I&#039;d highly recommend it for anyone relaxing and looking for a laugh.

    Each short episode of Tonari no Seki-kun is built on a similar foundation: Seki plays some comically elaborate game in the middle of class, and Yokoi, his more studious neighboring classmate, invariably gets sucked into what he&#039;s doing, to the point where she often becomes even more invested in it than him. That’s it. This seems like a fairly limited premise, but it provides a great framework with a surprising amount of comedic range for Seki to play in. The results are almost always a blast.<br />
<br />
The games Seki plays each episode range from staging complex, twist-laden wars with unconventional shogi play to bringing an actual

          <span style="display: none;" id="review171141">
        bag full of cats into class. There are episodes where he’s seen building crazy Rube Goldberg machines right in the middle a lecture. He never really speaks outside of determined grunts and the like, but there’s a ton of expression put into the way he reacts to the various scenarios he concocts. There’s a sadistic edge to how he goes about his games and the way he crafts his fiction that makes him a great foil for Yokoi to play off of. <br />
<br />
Yokoi&#039;s reactions to these scenarios are diverse and keep her from becoming a stock overreaction character. More of a protagonist than Seki is, the episodes are generally filled with her internal narrations. She’s sometimes quite taken by Seki&#039;s more sensitive side, only to be crushed when he reverts to his usual, harsher self. Other times the plots of Seki&#039;s games become so grim that she finds herself becoming engaged in them, in an attempt to steer them towards happier directions. There’s a running gag involving a robot family that Seki often brings to class, for example, that he often puts in dangerous situations or will just mistreat in general. Yokoi gets really attached to Seki’s narrative for this family and will put herself at risk of being caught by the teacher just to help sway their fate in the direction she wants. Of course Seki doesn’t just take this lying down and it becomes a fun battle for the outcome of these toy robots. And this is all while she’s trying her best to study! It’s a lot of fun seeing the creative ways she gets whisked away from this each episode. They play off each other really well and make for a great comedic duo. Also Yokoi is like totes adorbs.<br />
<br />
Presentation works wonders in capturing the comedic idiosyncrasies of the scenarios. The dramatic score and aggrandizing theatrics elevate these silly games to the status of tense, mortal conflicts. Effortlessly pulling the audience into the characters&#039; skewed sense of priority; the result is entertaining at every turn. Kana Hanazawa puts in a great performance as Yokoi, capturing the huge swings in emotion that Seki puts her through wonderfully. Fans of silly faces will find a lot to like here as well, as the show has a huge array of them that it uses really well to heighten the comedy. There are many places in the show where the creators went above and beyond, like giving the robot family their own theme song in the style of old mecha anime, or depicting shogi games as actual wars, acting out Seki’s stories. Even the OP and ED play out like skits from the show. The OP in particular is a clever meta piece about Seki actually animating Tonari no Seki-kun in class. A lot of subtle ingenuity went into making this simple premise a lot more than it seems.<br />
<br />
If there’s anything to complain about in this show, it’s that the show does have some rare instances where the punchlines can start to feel a bit samey. There are some recurring skits and although they still remain endearing, the edge of their punchlines are dulled on each successive rehash. It’s nothing too bad though and the short run time of the episodes makes these skits more of a fleeting occurrence before you’re back to something new again, but several of them did start to lose a bit of their luster for me by the end. They might even give the series a nice sense of continuity for some though, so your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Minor quibbles aside, this is an incredibly solid comedy. Seki and Yokoi have a great dynamic together and the show by and large does a superb job giving them varied situations to bring out the most in their personalities. Coupled with the grand presentation of it all, it’s easy to be whisked away into Seki’s antics just as Yokoi is. I doubt many will regret their time playing with Seki, especially without the risk of being caught by the teacher.

    Tonari no Seki-Kun is a simple show with simple stories. That&#039;s one of the things I really like about it, because it&#039;s easy to digest. The short length works great, and no single episode feels like it&#039;s overstaying it&#039;s welcome.<br />
However, the whole thing also feels pretty formulaic, which eventually started to wear on me. Even only watching at a relatively average pace (at one episode every morning), I began to get bored of it about halfway through. Some episodes were pretty funny, but I can&#039;t recall many times the show actually made me laugh out loud. A few episodes also recycled ideas from earlier episodes,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review146787">
        and just put a slight twist on them, which I thought seemed kind of lazy from a writing perspective.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty standard, and definitely common to what we normally see in the genre. It&#039;s well done, but it&#039;s nothing too impressive. I do think the character design is slightly better than what we typically see with this kind of art style, though.<br />
<br />
The voice acting is pretty standard as well, but it&#039;s well done for what it is. All of the actors represent their characters well, but again, nothing too remarkable here. I think where the show&#039;s audio really shines is with the opening and ending themes. They are super fun, catchy, and they fit perfectly with the setting of the show.<br />
<br />
The characters also go along with that sense of fun. The main characters Yokoi &amp; Seki-kun are somewhat interesting. Seki-kun is a pretty standard looking character, visually, but they do enough to make him unique. They never have him say any words, just grunts and groans, however I like this because it lets his personality be shown entirely through his actions. Yokoi, on the other hand describes what Seki-Kun is doing, essentially narrating things for us. She has an excitable personality, and really pulls a lot of the fun of the show together. There are a few other supporting characters, which feel very generic, but fill a gap well enough, and flesh out the cast just a tiny bit.<br />
<br />
Overall, Tonari no Seki-Kun is a somewhat average, but enjoyable show. What it ends up being isn&#039;t anything special, but it also doesn&#039;t really try to be. This is both good and bad, as it&#039;s a good quick bit of fun, but over the course of watching it, I slowly began to lose interest. The writing is good, but perhaps a bit weak, however, the characters tend to make up for that somewhat, with their somewhat unique identities. I&#039;d recommend it to anybody who enjoys the comedy genre and isn&#039;t expecting anything all that incredible... but just looking for a fun, simple show.

    Tonari no Seki-kun is an adaptation of a manga with the same name.  I have been reading this for awhile, I have already caught up with the manga already.  This anime is very creative and fun anime.  This anime is a 7-min and 21 episodes anime, the OVA and special will be releasing soon.<br />
<br />
Story: 8<br />
Tonari no Seki-kun is an anime revolves around Rumi Yokoi and her reaction and narration toward the person she sit next to Toshinari Seki or Seki-kun and his antics.  His antics consists on something new every time, and it distracted Rumi from her note taking and sometimes

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144983">
        she got in trouble because of his antics, and Seki-kun never gets in trouble.  He hasn&#039;t been caught because both of them sit in way back, Seki-kun sit by the back corner by the window, and Rumi sit next to him.  IDK how he have been caught it called anime logic&#039;s.<br />
<br />
Art: 8<br />
The art is not perfect Kyoto Animation.  But from manga to anime, it near perfect the manga and anime have similar art to it and I give a hand to the producer for that.  The art for Seki-Kun activities pretty good, expectually the art book one.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9<br />
The main girl Rumi Yokoi voice actor sings the opening of the anime.  She basically sing about her reaction toward Seki-kun antics.  The opening is pretty good, and the voice actor for Rumi is good but Seki-kun didn&#039;t say anything...at...all, but he never say anything in the manga as well. The ending have a drum theme to it, impressive but it didn&#039;t get my attention unlike the opening.<br />
<br />
Character: 10<br />
There are two main character of the anime, Rumi Yokoi and Toshinari Seki.  I like both of the main character and there designed, I got no beef with the character.  They are fun to watch and I have no complaint about the minor character as well.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10<br />
I enjoy this anime, I watch it every time when it came out to kill time because I have read the manga and know what going to happen next.  But that don&#039;t take away the enjoyment I receive from this anime.<br />
<br />
Overall: 9<br />
The anime is good time to watch, it&#039;s only 7-min long and 21 episode plus the OVA and Special is coming out soon and I can&#039;t wait for that.

    Tonari no Seki-kun: The master of killing time is a charming collection of 7 minute comedy episodes revolving around, as the title suggests, Seki-kun and the mischief he gets up to in the attempt to kill time.  <br />
<br />
Rather than the story following Seki-kun, it is instead told through the eyes of his classmate Rumi Yokoi who sits next to him in class and this greatly works to the shows benefit. A large portion of the humour of this show comes from Rumi’s interpretation of what Seki-kun is doing rather than what his own thought process is. The ‘Shogi’ episodes in the series highlight this

          <span style="display: none;" id="review173649">
        perfectly as Rumi creates her own story around the way Seki chooses to play the game and she subsequently tries to intervene with the game in order to ‘save’ the characters she made up. To this extent Tonari no Seki-kun is able to do a lot with short episodes and limited dialogue and I find the simplistic yet well implemented animation gives both Rumi Yokoi and Seki-kun fantastic personality without really having an overarching storyline or conclusion. <br />
<br />
Initially Rumi and Seki-kun seem like polar opposites, with Rumi wanting to focus on her studies but Seki-kun more interested in passing the time. As the show goes on and Seki-kuns antics are explored further you find that they are not so different after all and many things she accuses him of are things she is guilty of as well, which is subtly conveyed to the viewer not only in the episode but also in its wonderful OP/ED which perfectly epitomises the relationship between the two characters. Both the opening and the ending themes are super catchy and had me watching them each episode even though I had the option to skip. I seriously suggest you watch them if you are unsure about this show as they will give you a decent idea of what to expect from it. <br />
<br />
The musical score in episode is not really memorable but it was used when appropriate and to good effect, so it certainly does not outstay its welcome nor will it make your viewing experience worse. One thing that is of note however is that many of the concepts introduced by the show such as the Shogi games or ‘Robot Family’ gets reused multiple times. With such short episodes and the series totalling at 21 episodes overall I can’t help but feel like this anime would have been better if a wider variety of ‘time wasting challenges’ had been used. That is not to say the Shogi or Robot Family episodes were poorly made, in fact they are some of the best in the series, however reused concepts in such a short series comes off as somewhat lazy to me. <br />
<br />
Overall I loved this anime and it is just as easily enjoyed regardless of whether you watch an episode a day or binge through it all in one go. Tonari no Seki-kun is not the gods gift to humanity; it is however a delightful little show that offers a lot in a short space of time. Try it and see because who knows; maybe you will get the same enjoyment out of as I did.<br />

    Anime series with a short episode runtime often go ignored even when some of them are genius, I find myself feeling happy when I see a different response towards &quot;Tonari no Seki-kun&quot; <br />
Supposedly, you&#039;re are sitting in your classroom looking at your teacher running his mouth nonstop, it&#039;s the easiest to have your attention deflected at such a time even with those minor distractions.What&#039;d you do if the things happening beside you are more interesting than what&#039;s going on before you? Could you avoid it? That our Rumi Yokoi for you. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ll make myself write something brief and prompt for an anime that only runs

          <span style="display: none;" id="review145335">
        a little over 6 mins in every episode, as 30 seconds are dedicated to the OP &amp; ED songs. <br />
<br />
Rumi is the main protagonist and the narrator of the show and Seki~kun who sits next to her is always playing games at his desk. That is pretty much the whole gist there is no real plot, which actually seems to work well here. Humor is mostly delivered through Seki&#039;s actions and expressions,exaggeration of events and Rumi&#039;s incessant commentary. Even then both characters seems to be likeable and you&#039;ll only laugh out loud listening to Yokoi rattle away since the anime mostly depends on it to convey its hilarity.The episodes open to normal games whether it&#039;s domino,chess or Shogi but things get more ridiculous with each passing second. The comedy is nice and light hearted. The animation neat and clean considering each episode is so short and such series are mostly low budgeted and focused on content <br />
<br />
There is no music in the series other than the OP &amp; ED and a Robot song, I personally have come to even like the ED and am enjoying listening to the full version. <br />
<br />
There aren&#039;t many character interactions as each secondary character doesn&#039;t show up more than twice or thrice through out the whole series, their appearances and encounters with the main characters are kept strictly minor. <br />
<br />
Yokoi&#039;s seiyuu is Kana Hanazawa, a renowned voice in the industry (notable roles are Kosaki Onodera and Angel Kanade Tachibana) which is important as much of the humor is in the comical dialogue delivery too. Seki never really talks. <br />
<br />
The anime series is a braincandy and can be watched when your trying to take a break between episodes, seasons or when your thinking of what to watch after you&#039;ve just finished something. The show proves a point to you that humor can be created without the ecchiness and still be very funny. It&#039;s not just a bunch of boob and panty jokes thrown together (Mangaka-san to Assistant-san, I am eyeing u) but the gags are just for laughs so don&#039;t judge or take the show too seriously.<br />
<br />
The series is very innovative and gripping, something creative has been done but as a second opinion, Always, the girl however reluctant ends up getting involved in Seki-kun&#039;s acts that results in her name getting called out by the teacher, It all comes down to personal taste as some may find this repetitive and boring,So if you find yourself paying more attention to what the teacher is saying instead of what Seki-kun&#039;s doing, you&#039;re bored of the show, because that&#039;s what the show should be doing, keeping your mind off the lesson but I am only speaking hypothetically.<br />
Hence, watch it before you windup a conclusion. As for me I felt much enjoyment in watching it. If you get really entertained by the series you&#039;ll find yourself chuckling at the ludicrousness of it all, I was never bored and got really consumed in the series I was only disrupted when I had to choose another episode to watch but I really enjoyed my 150+ minutes<br />
<br />
I found each episode ending rather quickly but contrary to that I won&#039;t be complaining about the length of every episode because even though I am left wanting for more, some things are best left just the way they&#039;re, It&#039;s an intuition  that the anime is an adaption of a 4-panel comic strip. The run time of the show  is also the reason for it&#039;s excellence, because while the characters might feel so underdeveloped to some, having a normal run time would have more character interactions, romantic development but we want to preserve the show&#039;s uniqueness, or else it would&#039;ve drifted away from it&#039;s main motive of creating humor, simply humor, ordinary humor, amusing humor, the run time adds to distinguish the show from the other animes. Though this can become a long time running anime series but with short episodes. I hope it comes back soon.<br />
<br />
Conclusion- when you&#039;re looking for ways to kill your time, why not do it in an extravagant manner with Seki~kun, The master of killing time, afterall nobody does it better than him. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading it right till the end ^^ if u did, I know I said it would quick.

    Tonari no Seki-kun reminded me that you don&#039;t need the glitz and glamor of today&#039;s standards of high budget animation to fully enjoy a show.<br />
Knowing the fact that they did this with limited resources, I&#039;m quite impressed with the result: 21 short episodes, great OP and ED sequence, very likable characters and superb performance by Kana Hanezawa as Yokoi.<br />
Each episode was truly amusing and a pleasure to watch. <br />

    Tonari no Seki-kun : The master of killing time<br />
So, exactly as the title of this anime <br />
Or they should Yokoi wants to know all her next-seat classmate is doing? ╲(｡◕‿◕｡)╱<br />
Well, it really worked pretty well for me.. For killing time<br />
So, what&#039;s the best time for watching this?<br />
When you&#039;re resting from doing your homework, waiting for someone/something, while eating snacks, when your TV at commercial break (Don&#039;t watch it before you sleep, because you won&#039;t sleep after 1 episode )<br />
Ok here&#039;s a thing if you didn&#039;t notice<br />
It&#039;s a 7-8mins short anime or 1/3 time of the usual anime (1 min+ for OP&amp;ED)<br />
<br />
Why I recommend this?<br />
First the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review197798">
        story<br />
Obviously the story is about killing time<br />
Most of the time they just sit in a classroom while the teacher there<br />
There is Seki who likes to play something else while the teacher teaching something (Good boys&amp;girls don&#039;t do that xD)<br />
And there is Yokoi, who&#039;s always curious with whatever Seki do, keep watching him &amp; commentating furiously (not really), and regretted it after that<br />
Because she didn&#039;t listen to the teacher&#039;s lesson<br />
Simple story yet so interesting<br />
<br />
Art?<br />
Hmm I have to say nothing special about the arts<br />
But overall it&#039;s good<br />
Why?<br />
The expression, especially Yokoi (Well she&#039;s the only one who had many expressions) just really really.. make things so interesting<br />
I mean without those face expressions you obviously can&#039;t imagine how this anime will going to be.. right?<br />
For Seki-kun oh well his expressions all went to his &quot;creation&quot; effects xD<br />
<br />
So, how about the sounds?<br />
Well voice acting... You need something more than this?<br />
The voice acting is the one that making things alive!!<br />
HanaKana, everyone&#039;s favorite<br />
I&#039;m pretty sure almost all of MAL&#039;s people knew her pretty well<br />
She really did a great job<br />
Usually you&#039;ll hear her as a introvert, shy, and a quiet character but adorable<br />
So, how about this one?<br />
Well her character wasn&#039;t really talking loud about all of her &quot;comments&quot;<br />
But still her character obviously not a quiet one<br />
Her voice really made Seki&#039;s &quot;creation&quot; perfect<br />
Without her &quot;tsukkomi&quot; voice everything just become dull<br />
Thank you HanaKana! Good job! xD<br />
<br />
Seki-kun, many people said Shimono Hiro just doing nothing at all<br />
But those guys are wrong<br />
He&#039;s doing something amazing<br />
His character wasn&#039;t not talking at all<br />
But he&#039;s still doing other sounds, like sound effects.. <br />
Tbh it&#039;s kinda hard sometimes to do something like that<br />
There&#039;ll be an episode that he have to do the sound effects by his own voice.. only his voice<br />
He really did a great job! I mean really, you&#039;ll see later<br />
<br />
OP&amp;ED<br />
OP is sung by HanaKana, the lyrics are reflecting Yokoi&#039;s feelings<br />
ED just an instrumental+some gibberish by some student&#039;s tools (ex : pencilcase, pencil, &quot;lab glass&quot;)<br />
<br />
Characters...<br />
Well<br />
Let&#039;s start from Seki<br />
A boy who didn&#039;t like studying in a classroom at all, so he brought all of his toys to the classroom<br />
He&#039;s playing with them while his classmate looked at him (I think he&#039;s planning this xD)<br />
And Yokoi<br />
Because Seki&#039;s &quot;creation&quot; need someone&#039;s reaction to make it alive<br />
They way she made the &quot;comments&quot; are way too hilarious, you can&#039;t deny her way to make them<br />
Her voice too full of expression too, so you&#039;re bound to laugh / just grin widely<br />
<br />
For both of them<br />
Well I don&#039;t really know myself<br />
But, I really shipped them even if there&#039;s no romance at all<br />
I mean if you&#039;re watching them till the end, you know they&#039;re really adorable together<br />
They have some kind of &quot;red strings being tied together&quot;.. Right g-guys?<br />
<br />
It&#039;s a short anime, but it&#039;s really interesting<br />
When I&#039;m watching this, I just felt it&#039;s just one or two minutes<br />
That means, if you&#039;re really enjoying something, your sense of time just *poof.. Gone xD<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
Why don&#039;t you try for yourself the first 3 episode?<br />
It&#039;s just 21 min, the same time like 1 episode of a &quot;normal&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my review <br />
Hope it helps you<br />
I really like short anime like this<br />
How about you? You like it too?<br />

    Tonari no Seiki-kun is a fantastic anime. The idea of having the episodes set on a class, in which there is a girl who keeps watching her colegue entertain himself during the class on many different ways, is really clever and well done.<br />
The episodes are around 10mins each and it may seem pretty small but you get the full enjoyment of a &quot;saturday morning sit on the couch watching cartoons as kids&quot; type of feeling.<br />
It&#039;s really nice watching the various activities Seiki does during class, for example watching him making epic war scenarios out of small little food.<br />
Overall it is a fun series to watch,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review164961">
        fast to watch and totaly worth checking out.

    Tonari no Seki-kun has episodes<br />
that average around 7 minutes<br />
long in length ... but don&#039;t let the<br />
length fool you into disregarding<br />
this anime as having no plot. Each<br />
episode consists of Seki bringing<br />
his newest distraction of the day<br />
while Rumi attempts to ignore<br />
what&#039;s going on next to her,<br />
failing every time as she finds<br />
herself drawn into what he&#039;s<br />
doing. The plot for each episode<br />
was wonderfully done and<br />
immensely entertaining! xD The<br />
characters basically consist of<br />
Rumi and Seki with the occasional<br />
appearance or comment from a<br />
classmate ... both of the main<br />
characters were wonderfully<br />
entertaining. It was a wonder to<br />
me how entertaining Seki was<br />
even though he never said a single<br />
word ... not in any of the 21<br />
episodes!

          <span style="display: none;" id="review168381">
        The animation was nice,<br />
nothing spectacular, mind you,<br />
but nicely done all the same. All in<br />
all I very much enjoyed this<br />
anime! Every episode brought a<br />
huge smile to my face and even<br />
the occasional laugh! I very much<br />

    Tonari No Seki-Kun may be the funniest anime I&#039;ve watched since starting Gintama. That is saying a lot, since the episodes are quite short at about 7 minutes long, but that is plenty of time for this anime to tell an effective and hilarious story.<br />
<br />
Story: 9.5/10<br />
Short, sweet and to the point. Seki-kun&#039;s antics and Yokoi&#039;s great imagination and creativity are so entertaining to watch. They use the best methods of storytelling with Yokoi&#039;s expressive narration in combination with Seki-kun&#039;s almost exclusive use of physical comedy to tell creative tales of love, hardship and determination using common toys and games. They are such simple stories, but

          <span style="display: none;" id="review144521">
        I haven&#039;t laughed so much watching an anime in so long. You cannot help it when you see how ridiculous Seki-kun and Yokoi can get. The only thing keeping this anime from getting a 10/10 was that they occasionally repeated &quot;toys/games&quot;, but the seeing these toys/games again may have been funnier than the first time around. <br />
<br />
Art: 10/10<br />
Sound: 8/10<br />
Not much to say about the art...it&#039;s awesome. Love the use of colour scheme in the different stories. They used sound clips pretty well to add from the scene but I find that I didn&#039;t pay attention much to the sounds as I was so caught up in Yokoi&#039;s storytelling. But a majority of this score goes to the opening and ending themes; catchy and unique. <br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
Yokoi&#039;s imagination makes the show what it is, as Seki-kun barely (if not ever) speaks in the series. Her interpretation of his behaviour is hysterical. Despite not speaking, Seki-kun&#039;s physical comedy is second-to-none. He comes up with such imaginative ways to play and mess around during class. I won&#039;t reveal these next &quot;characters&quot; but these 3 little guys stole any episode they were in. Seki-kun&#039;s interaction with these 3 &quot;characters&quot; really made them my favourite  secondary characters despite never speaking either. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 10/10<br />
Overall: 10/10<br />
I think it is obvious how much fun I had watching this series. It is an easy series to get through and so is definitely worth watching. I  really hope there is another season or 2 because I just can&#039;t get enough of this classroom fun.

    This anime was really enjoyable from the start to the end, It&#039;s basically a 7-min-per-episode kinda anime, but that&#039;s actually perfect, couse that&#039;s all ya need for doing this kind of thing.<br />
The episodes are really fun, watching Yokoi&#039;s mindfucks over Seki&#039;s things is always hilarious. The art-style is extremely simplistic but it&#039;s good in it&#039;s simplicity. The opening isn&#039;t bad, but the ending is really good, I usually always stayed till the end just to dance to the ending.<br />
Now for the recommendation thing I always do... This is that kind of anime that you watch once in a while when you&#039;re bored just to kill

        time (oh the irony), so... if you ever find yourself in one of those moments, kill that time with Seki, you won&#039;t regret it

    Ah, Tonari no Seki-kun or as in English, The Master of Killing Time is a rather short series with quite the amount of episodes. The show is about a girl (Rumi Yokoi) who sits a few inches away from Seki-kun, the master of killing time in multiple classes and narrates his actions as she watches him goof off. I admit it sounds incredibly boring to watch, but after getting 3 to 4 episodes in I was actually genuinely interested in what Seki-kun was going to pull out of his bag. Yokoi (and a few other characters) over exaggerate everything Seki-kun does which honestly makes the

          <span style="display: none;" id="review199773">
        show a bit more intriguing to watch and not entirely dull. Basing this off of the animation, story telling, sound, &amp; personal enjoyment, I give Tonari no Seki-kun: The Master of Killing Time a 7/10. It wasn&#039;t great yet it wasn&#039;t bad, it kept you interested long enough to make you want to binge watch the rest of the series. I recommend watching it if you haven&#039;t already, overall it was a pretty decent anime. Crossing fingers in hopes that they make a second season. I&#039;m looking at you, Shin-Ei Animation.. e.e

    Tonari no Seki-kun is a 21 episodic short anime that focuses about Seki-kun&#039;s weird killing time during classes. Usually, instead of doing something productive like reading or writing notes, he instead plays and entertains himself just for fun. And as Seki-kun is busy on what his doing, his seatmate, Rumi, got herself distracted thanks to Seki-kun.<br />
<br />
This cliche goes on and on from start to finish. But in every episode, Seki-kun has different tools and equipments, and toys to play with his desk. And Yes, it&#039;s indeed entertaining to watch too... for just 7 minutes (times 21... and you&#039;ll get 147 minutes of school comedy moments

          <span style="display: none;" id="review219252">
        of watching Seki doing weird plays on his desk!)<br />
<br />
The setting for the plot is only focuses on one classroom (sometimes on the pool of their school).<br />
<br />
The art of this anime is like I&#039;m watching a remastered version of the 90s-2000s art form of this anime. But it&#039;s good nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The Sound, is good. From VAs, to the fun OP song of Rumi&#039;s rapping to slow but fun melody. The ED song though... mmmm... Not so good.<br />
<br />
Tonari no Seki-kun is really entertaining to watch and Seki&#039;s character is always bringing his tricks under his sleeve just to entertain himself, while Rumi is also entertaining herself too but she always gets hooked everytime Seki bringing his Toys to the School. Rumi sometimes help him but only in desperate times. For Seki, he&#039;s just a quiet guy with a childish personality.<br />
<br />
With that being said, this anime is good and it is recommended to watch this anime! Just... don&#039;t expect to have some love story chemistry because this anime is just plain slice-of-life, comedic anime about Seki&#039;s killing time during boring lectures.<br />
<br />
Class Dismissed...

    Funny short animation. And HanaKana never dissapointed me with her great voice acting! Yes, this show focus to HanaKana character, not for the male lead. And i really happy about that situation. Lmao!<br />
<br />
There is no complex story telling this show has. Its simply animate the reaction over some random activity the main lead has! Yes, random, and sometime, weird. Another scene being a psycopat. Even go to the killing scene (just for the joke sake). And more shit thrown up to the surface of the show. And we, just sit here, watching how cute the reaction HanaKana made at entire session!<br />
<br />
Haha, yes, i came here

          <span style="display: none;" id="review332248">
        for that purpose. To listen cute sound made by HanaKana. No other meaning watching this nonsense. I dont even get the joke quiet well since they bring no impact. Yet, the comedy feel so cringe. It sometime get save by HanaKana, since her voice acting so inspirit!<br />
<br />
Yes. if this show had no HanaKana, then it must admit as the worst show i ever watch. As comedy genre, not for other aspect, right?<br />
<br />
To be fair, all aspect review i must say, at average stage. I dont really feel bore, nor never feel amazed. All just generic, still i admit the thanks to the HanaKana whom save this show from very first episode. Some scene maybe good, sometime maybe surprised me with their randomness. However, i dont really think this anime bad, nor horrible. Just at average level is really fit all situation.<br />
<br />
Music aspect was my most attention over this show. It show so so. Even with the voice mad by Hana, i dont really feel good. Suck with it, you should do better than that, you pal! Yet, the art and sound suit well. Thanks to HanaKana again, thats all. Do not take it personally. The art rather at the middle line, but with the VA HanaKana involved, art just going to be perfect at my point of view. Lol, yes, blame me, dont blame the show!<br />
<br />
I guest its all over, seems done to me. No more word over this, you just interpret it for yourself. Okay? Yes, thanks for the good show, and i hope HanaKana always made me happy at the next show i watch. Ahahaha<br />
<br />
(Note: this review also include with OVA episode.There is no contrast. A generic one should get a generic comment, right?<br />
Oh, another note. I must include this to plus 1 score, to the respect of short anime completion. This show actually great, never dissapointed me, so, 7 overall still good than 5 or 6. Haha)

    Here&#039;s my take after watching 21 episodes of the fun and time killing : The Master of Killing Time by Shin-Ei Animation Studio.<br />
<br />
How should I put this...<br />
<br />
Tonari no Seki kun is great take on an enjoyable way to kill time. Since each episode is just around 7 minutes it is easy to watch on your phone while on the go and it does not try and stretch itself that the story or &quot;period&quot; becomes laggy. <br />
<br />
But don&#039;t be thrown away with the running time since it remarkably retains the essence of the story, the tension it brings and the laughs that makes you break out

          <span style="display: none;" id="review262959">
        it laughter. <br />
<br />
The story mainly revolves on the quirky and playful Toshinari Seki and his curious observer/forced participant class neighbor Rumi Yokoi.<br />
<br />
Each episode is a period in their class and is a story on itself. During each of those periods Seki is doing different ways to kill time like: toppling a chain of eraser domino, playing weird shogi, buffing his desk and my personal favorite playing with his robot family.<br />
<br />
The story does not take itself seriously and that is what is great about it!<br />
<br />
The art is good enough to make the characters and the story to take the lead of the story and the music is fun and catchy, especially the ending song.<br />
<br />
You would not regret watching Tonari no Seki kun and you might be addicted and binge watch all episodes in one sitting. But if you end up doing that and want more you can continue reading the great manga of the same name by Takuma Morishige as it has currently have 73 chapters and still going.<br />
<br />
With that said, I will give Tonari no Seki kun 9 shogi pieces out of 10!

    In the words of Leonardo da Vinci, ‘simplicity is the ultimate sophistication’.<br />
<br />
Tonari no Seki-kun is incredibly simple, yet it’s imaginative, creative, engrossing, and funny. It’s hard to believe they managed to make such an enjoyable series from a bunch of 7 minute episodes - although in hindsight the short episodes worked better for the anime than longer ones would have. Just the right amount of time is spent on each of Seki’s antics. It never gets boring, and I think the reason why is that the script is written so cleverly and voice-acted so well. The script-writers managed to create a perfect balance of fascination,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review269364">
        annoyance and exasperation on Yokoi’s part, mixed with a tad of resignation to keep it relatable for the viewers. Her reactions to Seki’s time-killing are what makes this series. Kudos to Kana Hanazawa for her superb performance.<br />
<br />
Seki’s also a great character. Even without hearing him speak once, his personality is clearly evident through his actions. From the focus he shows when working on each of his projects, to the way his facial expressions change when acting out a story or playing a game, to the way he treats Yokoi, and then the different way he reacts to the other members of his class. All showcase different aspects of his personality and we end up with someone who’s mischievous, curious, and pure. A delightful combination.<br />
<br />
Seki’s activities vary in scale. Some are totally harmless (if also totally bizarre), some are merely a nuisance to the people around him, some are ridiculous and some border on dangerous. The most frequently affected victim is Yokoi, who seems both unable and unwilling to turn her attention away from Seki and risk missing out on his next performance. Initially, you empathize with Yokoi, but Seki’s antics grow on you bit by bit and eventually you’re as eager to see what he’ll do next as Yokoi is. There’s no plotline to speak of – Seki’s antics are the plot. There would be no point scoring it on how well the story develops, cos that’s not the point of the anime at all.<br />
<br />
Music is lively and catchy, and art is simple. Nothing flashy or out of place.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the anime is just a collection of entertaining shorts about two ordinary people with extraordinary imaginations and a healthy sense of curiosity. I’d give it a watch, it won’t take up much of your time and you’ll probably enjoy it. XD<br />

    Tonari no seki-kun is that anime which you would simply fall in love with .Even if you are in despair because your favourite character died in some random anime you have been watching or even if you have a list of hot mainstream anime in your list which you haven&#039;t watched, still I can guarantee you this will keep u busy, interested and will completely cope your mind in finding more time to watch it and see it throughout till the end.<br />
<br />
Story:<br />
 The story revolves around a girl named Rumi Yokoi and her classroom neighbour Seki-kun, who never seems interested in class and does so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281067">
        many random things to keep himself from being bored. But these out-of-the-blue things which he does constantly keeps Rumi bugging as she wants to study yet in the same time they are so interesting that she finds herself coped in them.<br />
<br />
Art,Sound &amp; Character:<br />
 I simply loved the art (not so great but just enough to digest).<br />
The opening is one of my favourites which i never skipped.<br />
As for Seki-kun ,he does&#039;nt has a voice character, yes u heard me right ,he does&#039;nt says even a single word throughout the series but the surprise is you will never find it necessary, yes the story is written that beautifully.<br />
<br />
I have rated it 9 for the sake of other really awesome anime I have watched but for a more accurate view , I would rather give it a 9.5.
