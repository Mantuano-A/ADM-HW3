    Seeing as how hilarious this show is, I&#039;m really surprised there are no reviews for it yet. Usually there are 10 reviews for any given show that&#039;s only a couple of episodes in. Same goes for the relatively low score. My guess is it&#039;s because of the art style that many people seem to be turned off by. Don&#039;t be mislead however, as this is by far the funniest thing to happen to anime this season.<br />
<br />
Story - It&#039;s really difficult to describe a show based on only a few episodes, but Mitsudomoe doesn&#039;t really need a full season&#039;s worth of episodes for that. The anime

        is gag driven, much like Azumanga Daioh. Each episode works as a standalone one, divided into multiple mini gag-based plots. That&#039;s not to say that there is no long term plot throughout the series, because there is. The story revolves around a male teacher, who begins his new career teaching a middle school class that contains the troublesome Marui triplets. There is also a clumsy school nurse that he falls in love with at the beginning. This love progresses, if you could even call it progress, as the episodes go on. Primarily though, the show is about the triplets and their teacher getting into all manner of hilarious circumstances, often involving the classmates and the school nurse. Beware however, since Mitsudomoe is adult humor driven much of the time.<br />
<br />
Art/Animation - The first thing you might notice is that the art is reminiscent of Azumanga, particularly the heads. Unlike most of the anime released, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute. This suits Mitsudomoe perfectly in my opinion, since it amplifies the hilarity of many of the circumstances. In episode 3 you&#039;re introduced to the triplets&#039; father, who is drawn in a rough/sketchy style. I find it makes for a funny contrast between him and everyone else. The animation is fluid and consistent in terms of quality, with often exaggerated expressions for added comedic effect. This works seamlessly in my opinion. <br />
As for the bg art, there isn&#039;t really much to say other than that it&#039;s drawn to compliment the simple character designs. The bg coloring is appealing with a muted palette, which sometimes exhibits a slightly marker rendered look.<br />
<br />
Sound - This is where many shows fall flat in, typically not having anything praise worthy. The seiyuu&#039;s are noteworthy, especially Tomatsu Haruka (known for voicing Lala Deviluke from To LOVE-Ru) and Shimono Hiro (known for voicing Akihisa Yoshii from Baka To Test). The voice work is well done and brings out the characters&#039; personalities really well. The sfx and atmospheric music also deserve to be praised, since they play an important role in the comedy. There are some truly hilarious sfx here and music that cues in at just the right time. The blood draining sound is especially amusing.<br />
The OP also deserves mentioning for its cute and catchy tune.<br />
<br />
Character - We have the 3 Marui sisters, Yabe-sensei (main teacher), Kuriyama-sensei (school nurse), as well as many side characters that are introduced in more detail through various points in the story. The triplets consist of Futaba who is the perverted muscle girl, Hitoha who is the dark and gloomy one, and Mitsuba who is the sadistic type as well as the self proclaimed king of the class. The inexperienced, newly transferred teacher and super clumsy school nurse round out the main characters. There is also the father of the Marui sisters, who looks like a big, creepy pervert. I&#039;d also mention all the other secondary characters, but I&#039;d need a lot more space to describe them all. Needless to say, they all have their own unique personalities that get their spotlight as the anime progresses. Overall, a great and entertaining assortment of characters make up Mitsudomoe.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment - I&#039;m loving this! Simple as that. Sometimes gag based shows are needed to change the pace and this manages to do just that for me. The relationship between the triplets and everyone around them is entertaining and I can&#039;t help but cheer up after watching each episode.<br />
<br />
Overall - If you loved Azumanga Daioh, then you will probably like this. Keep in mind that even though Mitsudomoe has a very innocent air about it, it is meant for a more mature audience largely because of the adult humor. If you can appreciate humor the way I do, but at the same time are not easily turned off by the cute art style or the adult themes, then give Mitsudomoe a serious consideration. You won&#039;t regret it.

    Mitsudomoe is the stupidest anime I have ever had the good fortune to see. The premise is cliché; the everyday life of three very unique sisters. The art is awful and follows a long line of under-budget slice-of-life comedies that always end up in your computer&#039;s recycling bin after viewing. But by some miracle, Mistudomoe is fresh and funny, and will always leave you craving for another episode. What Mistudomoe also is though, is vulgar. It&#039;s rude and frequently disgusting, idiotic and atrocious, and violent and inappropriate in any way it can be. That being said you should easily be able to tell it&#039;s one

          <span style="display: none;" id="review30833">
        of the funniest things on TV.<br />
<br />
Story: 6/10<br />
Yabe-sensei is class 6-3&#039;s new teacher. His class appears normal and easy-going at first, but then to his dismay, he has to control all three of the craaaaziest kids in school who just HAPPEN to be triplet sisters. The Marui triplets run amok through the school and cause everyone problems everywhere. Now, that&#039;s about it for the actual story, but whatever segment you watch in Mistudomoe always ends up being laugh out loud funny by the end. The jokes rely a lot on misunderstandings, running gags, and dirty humor. For example, the Marui&#039;s father is drawn with a thick black line around him, and the line makes him look extra suspicious. How is this supposed to be funny? Anytime their father tries to do something for them he always ends up getting arrested by the cops. Eventually the joke becomes so frequent you have dialogue like &quot;Sorry girls, I was late because I was arrested three times on the way here.&quot; If you&#039;ve a certain disdain for bathroom humor, I would not recommend this. There were actually a few scenes that made me so sick I almost gagged myself (a shining example is the episode in which the nurse accidentally spills everyone in the schools urine samples on the ground).<br />
<br />
Art: 6/10<br />
Oh, well, it&#039;s bad. If you&#039;re watching Mistudomoe then the visuals aren&#039;t your top priority. It looks very basic and some would as far to say it looks generic - but oh the reaction faces. Even if what just happened in the anime wasn&#039;t funny, if Futaba (the middle sister) does her euphoric &quot;my brain is dead&quot; face I&#039;d laugh. The emotion that comes out of the characters faces definitely increases the quality of the humor and characters. The art style works for what kind of anime this is, but I think many things could have been improved upon, and if Mistudomoe were re-done the thing that I would ask be worked would be the backgrounds, CG, and overall fluidity of animation.<br />
<br />
Sound: 9/10<br />
The voice acting was great! The very main cast was voiced by some pretty obscure folks, the most well known one, who voiced Nagi in Kannagi, is Tomatsu Haruka, who voices Hitoha (the youngest sister) in Mistudomoe. The side cast is blooming with stars, including Aki Toyosaki (Yui from K-ON!), Inoue Kikuko (Lust from FMA:B), Saito Chiwa (Aika from Aria), and last but not least, Chihara Minori who voices Yuki in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu.<br />
<br />
Now onto the musical portion. The opening instantly caught me off guard, all three girls of the main cast could sing so well! The singing and dancing set you up for an exciting episode every time - not once did I skip the opening song. The ending song was rather unfitting though. It&#039;s a slow almost melancholic song that doesn&#039;t really seem right until the very last episode. Then there&#039;s the BGM. Always supplying a chuckle the music ranges from parodies of talk shows to classical music pieces played in incredibly unfitting ways. Since this show uses a lot of slapstick, the sound effects are also an important part. I found the noises that came from whatever always top notch (the blood leaking noises were so silly I got hearty laugh the first time it happened).<br />
<br />
Character: 9/10<br />
The &quot;three stooges&quot; concept has been in media for quite a long time and has become so frequent that it&#039;s become cliché. I started watching Mistudomoe expecting some ridiculous corny character archetypes, and I kinda got exactly that. No there&#039;s not a lot of character development, no changes over time, no sudden changes in character, and so on. What Mitsudomoe has that other shows lack is the application of such poor designs into being jokes themselves. I&#039;ve already explained the storyline - and if you take it for face value - it&#039;s horrendous. Now if you were to take the storyline and combine it with a colorful cast of different personalities bumping back and forth into each other, you&#039;d have something much more interesting. Each side character has his or her little own story, and after the point that they have been introduced they fall back into being side characters - but the thing is that now they keep adding to the story. Whereas the usual slice of life would have episodic episodes of characters and then you&#039;d never see them again, Mistudomoe repeatedly brings back the same characters again and again making a refreshing feel every time they come back.<br />
<br />
The cast includes the sadistic eldest sister, Mistuba, the perverted middle sister Futaba, and the introverted youngest sister Hitoha. Their teacher is an unlucky geek, their dad is loving fellow easily mistaken as a pedophile, and their friends are plentiful. There&#039;s the pervert, the nice kid mistaken as a pervert, his three female stalkers, the rival girl and her clique, the romantic, the occult freak, the hamster named nipples and the monkey faced kid. The best part about this anime is seeing how each character interacts with another, and every time they do, something ridiculous happens.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment: 8/10<br />
I laughed so hard I got sick and had to go to bed for over 14 hours to recover. Or well, maybe I was sick and the laughing triggered my allergies and then I kept coughing until I had to lie down and go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Want an interesting approach to something that has already been done, and want it from a viewpoint where it hacks the slice of life genre to pieces? Mitsudomoe should hit right home. The thing is though, if you didn&#039;t listen to warning at the beginning of this review about vulgarity and stupid humor then you&#039;re going to hate this. Hate it a lot. This is not an anime to be viewed for it&#039;s cutesy moments so abundant in slice of life (although it does has some), it&#039;s meant to be a hilarious attempt to get revenge upon the predictable slice of life genre.<br />
<br />
Overall: 8/10<br />
In short, Mitsudomoe is both great and awful. Plot wise, it&#039;s no better than the worst of anime, but the common misconception is that Mitsudomoe is an anime that is dependent on it&#039;s jokes for goodness, not it&#039;s riveting storyline (for it has none). The way the characters collide with such wit kept my full attention, while the chance of seeing it again kept me watching. The slapstick might not be for everyone though, it&#039;s sure to turn off a fair amount of people and I think that&#039;s a shame, because I really enjoyed this anime. So if you&#039;re interested in a good laugh, just throw on any episode of Mitsudomoe and have at it.

    This show is just fun. Perfect for when you want to sit down and enjoy pee, poop, fart, snot jokes. The animation is simple and cute, the opening is catchy and portrays what you will be getting into well and the characters are fun and memorable. You will feel disgusted with yourself for lowering your standards as a human being to watching such loli filled drivel, but so long as you have no self respect and a lock on your door, give this series a try.

    Hello! This is HatchetGirl with another review. Today, we shall be reviewing the series: Mitsudomoe!<br />
<br />
Story: While the whole loli&#039;s harrassing teacher plot is alittle over used, I still love this type of plot, so I give it a 10. <br />
<br />
Art: I really love the art style alot. It&#039;s so cute yet detailed.<br />
<br />
Sound: I really like the opening song. The ending one is pretty good too, but not really my cup of tea. The voice actors sound epic, too.<br />
<br />
Characters: There&#039;s Mitsuba, my favorite, who is the oldest, and kinda mean to all the other characters, but still somewhat shy and lovable. Futaba, the natural airhead who&#039;s

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31985">
        amazingly strong and almost always happy. And Hitoha, the somewhat demonic emotionless loli. Then there are side characters and teachers that I won&#039;t bother with.<br />
<br />
My enjoyment and overall: This was a cute and funny series, but not reccomended for people who like more &quot;All ages&quot; type of jokes. If you don&#039;t mind somewhat gross and perverted humor, then you may like this anime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!

    &quot;Did you think all kids are pure? Think again&quot; - Me<br />
<br />
Those phrases are the best word to describe this anime,anyway  Mitsudomoe is your funny and eccentric anime that you wouldn&#039;t find in anywhere. If there was anime that something like this, it would be Azumanga Daioh. This anime suprisingly is EXTREMELY funny, i am not exaggerate it, but it really does. beside of the awful art and average sounding, This anime gives some fresh jokes, not like the other comedy-gag anime which is usually really pushes the jokes, repetitive and even nothing funny at all. Thanks to the god, this anime wasn&#039;t like that.<br />
<br />
Mitsudomoe

          <span style="display: none;" id="review88609">
        is not all-age-gag-anime, i am must saying this again NOT-ALL-AGE-GAG-ANIME. since there is so much mature material that involves in this anime. Dont judge the anime just because of the covers. and it applies for this anime, It maybe like an anime for kids since this anime was all about kids and their activity in school. If you had thinking like that, then you have made a mistake. If Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou focus on how cute, pure and clumsy child is, then it Mitsudomoe is the &quot;EVIL version&quot; of them. Mitsudomoe jokes are literally a kind of adult jokes like Seitokai Yakuindomo, If Seitokai Yakuindomo usually use &quot;vulgar&quot; jokes then Mitsudomoe more less than that.<br />
<br />
The story in  Mitsudomoe is about The 11-year-old Marui triplets, yeah TRIPLETS. that being known as the most problematic kids in the school, and unluckily, Satoshi Yabe, the newly graduated teacher must led the class that have the trouble maker triplets.<br />
<br />
Since this anime is a gag anime, so, it doesnt have any main story or main goal. Usually their story in each episode are standalone, and from each episode, it usually consists of  mini gag-story like Danshi koukoushei no Nichijou. and its really usual for a gag anime that they use this method in their anime so its not surprising, If we&#039;re talking a gag anime, of course the story is not their main priority, the main focus of a gag anime is jokes. No matter how good their art, sound, or story is, if the jokes wasnt funny then its not a gag anime. So, the main question is, Is Mitsudomoe amusing to watch? For me, Yes it is.<br />
<br />
Like what i said before, Art is not the main priority in a gag. So does in Mitsudomoe. The weakest section of this anime are in art, but, for me is not something that we would critize at. Furthermore, there is something special in Mitsudomoe&#039;s art. Like how different between the triplet father with other character (The triplet father is being drawn differently with the other character). and do not miss the comedic effect too (like the funny expression that the character does or overly reaction to something). Something like comedic effect is usually intend to make the anime more funnier and sometimes to cover the lack in art section (See how Seto no Hanayome works) and with that method, its really work in Mitsudomoe.<br />
<br />
For the sound, there isnt something that really prominent, but how the each character respond the jokes are really amazing. The timing between their jokes and how they respond is really hit the spot.Especially Yabe Satoshi. Well, if you hear carefully you will realize that the seiyuu (Hiro Shimono) is an expert about this one (respond on the jokes) are the seiyuu for Akihisa from baka to test which we known are always use &quot;respond&quot; jokes and exaggerate respond. and for the OP and the ED, i didnt really notice it, since its just some catchy-child tones that i dont really like it. But how this story was about, its really fits with the anime itself.<br />
<br />
Moving on to Character section, the main character in Mitsudomoe is the triplets marui and the new graduated teacher, Yabe Satoshi. for the triplets, there is Marui Mitsuba, Marui Futaba, and Marui Hitoha.<br />
<br />
Marui Mitsuba is the eldest sister between three of them, she is someone who likes to torturing people or we can call the sadistic one. But for the eldest, she is somehow care for her younger sisters even she is didnt show it openly. She has obsession with being a king and more she proclaimed that she is a mature even though no people are really care about it.<br />
<br />
Marui Futaba is the second daughter in Marui triplets, she has a weird obsession and it was Boobs (yeah, a 11 YEARS old that has obsession with boobs), even she was like that, she is so athletic errr... not athletic maybe the words that fits with her is &quot;superhero power&quot;. She is able to destroy wall, table, or doors without any sweats and even she can run more faster than a scooter. Even she is strong like a superhero, she is kinda clumsy.<br />
<br />
Marui Hitoha, the youngest sister in Marui Triplets, my favorite character. She is a taciturn girl which always carries a &quot;glory&quot; books. What i mean in glory book is PORN magazine. beside of her emotionless, introvert and taciturn. She is a being feared by the other sisters and even the other sisters not dare to make her angry.<br />
<br />
Yabe Satoshi, is the homeroom teacher for the triplets. He always being a victim of the triplets. Not too much known for this character, since he was too normal for main character, maybe like Shinpachi from gintama.<br />
<br />
Summary, every character in Mitsudomoe have their own unique personalities, from the one that really perverted, the one that has obsession with supernatural things, even into a several girls who claimed as the Hopeless squad. With each their uniqueness, it brings Mitsudomoe into a bunch of people with their unique personalities, and for me, its really amusing to watch all of the characters.<br />
<br />
And the last, Mitsudomoe is something unique and keeps the viewer to watch it, with all the randomness that happen and all the unique personalities that all of the character have, you mustn&#039;t miss this funny anime. This anime always makes me laughing from the first episode to the last episode. I really recommend this.<br />
<br />
Critize, comments, or any feedbacks are welcome. :)<br />
<br />

    Story:<br />
It is about three elementary school triplets that have three very different personalities and a teacher who teaches all of them. However sadly the teacher barely had any role in this show which would probably have made it much funnier. Near the end the jokes get tiring as they are repetitive.<br />
<br />
Art:<br />
Animation is sufficient. The girls are cute enough, the exaggerations for comedic effect were well executed, however predictable and repetitive.  If you are into the cute elementary school animation then you will appreciate it, however if you are one of those that absolutely despise the cutesy animation then this is not for you to

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31096">
        watch.<br />
<br />
Sound:<br />
Background music is bearable. They could have really used less silences, because at some points of the show, it just got boring without any background music. (This is hard to notice though unless you pay attention it) The opening song though is very good, and I love the chorus with the dance. Cheers me right up.<br />
<br />
Character:<br />
The highlight of the show is the very defined characters, each with their own stereotypical personalities. Once again, it did get repetitive, but there were a diverse amount of characters to show sufficient originality in terms of the comedy of the show.<br />
<br />
Enjoyment:<br />
I really am a sucker for comedies such as these. However the problem with this is that the comedy was not very original, and almost every joke was a dirty joke, so you could practically predict every punchline.<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
This is not something that you must watch, but more of something you watch if you are extremely bored. It is not a show to marathon, but to spread out over a long time period so you might forget a joke that they are planning to use again. You might look at this review and think that a 6 is really low, however given that a 5 is average, this show is indeed above average.

    now as you are reading this and seeing that i gave this anime a 10, you maybe thinking that i really overrate this anime or that i&#039;m really lenient when scoring there things. well maybe you&#039;re right, maybe i do give out too many 10s. but that because i think it really deserves it. and here why<br />
<br />
story- 9<br />
the story most revolved around the three sisters, Futaba, Hitoha, and Mitsuba. at first i thought it would circle around the teacher yabe, which it didn&#039;t and that made me glad since he was kinda of dull and whinny. now every episode of this series has a style,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review31074">
        like Azumanga, where is it like a random scene then it transition to another scene and each episode has like 4 or 5. as you know random scene does not make a complex story and i&#039;m ok with that as long as it make me laugh and it sure does. ok i will say this now. 80 to 90% of this anime&#039;s joke come from misunderstanding. i really love it but if you hate joke like this then i recommend you stay way from it. the only problem is that if there it gets a little repetitive since they use it a lot and i guarantee if they had 26 episodes instead of 13 then the these joke would get stale and old by like 18<br />
<br />
art- 8<br />
the art was good nice and colorful. the only complain for me would be that the animation look like it appeals more to kid when it is aiming for teen. and there is a lot of perverted thing in this anime that kid should not see.<br />
<br />
sound-10<br />
now i&#039;m going to talk about the opening only since i did not listen to the end and i really don&#039;t worry about voice acting as long as it not really horrible or bad. the opening was so awesome that i never skipped it. every week i see this anime i love to always hear that song. it was catchy, upbeat, and had 3 (don&#039;t know ,but sound like 3) great sings behind. the video was good too. i laugh hard when i saw futaba break that desk the first time i saw it and i never got tire of seeing this.<br />
<br />
character-10<br />
now if you know me (which many of you don&#039;t) you know that i think character are the backbone of any good anime and i say &quot;now&quot; a lot. i think this. i mean if someone make the all time greatest action story of all time with a lot of explosion and then the main character are the Alvin and the chimp muck guys. would you see. shit no you wouldn&#039;t. now getting back on topic this anime each of the sister  is unique and funny. hell even the minor character are funny too. futaba is superman strong but lack a IQ point. she is also very fond of the chesty area. hitoha( my favorite character) is a very shy person but can be very scary since she has the ability to turn into the girl from the ring. and finally mitsuba who love hurting other and think she is better than other but sometime she can be nice which really count.<br />
<br />
enjoyment- 10<br />
now out of all the anime i watch for the summer season i think this has to be the best. every week when i watch anime this is the first to be pick and i love waiting for it to come out. it was really great with awesome character and the great opening. it really deserves this 10<br />
<br />
overall-10<br />
you maybe questioning my math right now saying &quot;9+8+10+10+10 is not 10 it is 9.4 which is close to 9&quot;. and you are right but i disregard the laws of math and make it 10. JUST KIDDING.  i&#039;m not the type to grade to harsh or exact. i&#039;m the type to forgive a little (especially the skypier arc in one  piece that shit was long) since i really like it. and now THAT IS ALL

    As a fan of comedy and slice of life anime, I am pretty surprised at how well-received this anime is. I just didn&#039;t find it very funny - for the most part it just grossed me out.<br />
<br />
The story? Well this isn&#039;t a story-based anime. It&#039;s a slice of life comedy, so calling it out on its lack of story would be foolish. The idea is that a nervous new teacher has a class of bratty children to deal with, including three sisters who are sure to give him a hard time. &quot;Hilarity&quot; ensues.<br />
<br />
The art and sound are both sub-par. Which is unsurprising from the forgettable

          <span style="display: none;" id="review281795">
        studio Bridge. I dislike the character designs a lot. They are very unappealing in that they aren&#039;t at all cute. They are sort of comedic with some occasionally funny expressions, but not exceedingly. I&#039;m no expert on OST but this left on impression on me whatsoever. The OP is... alright at capturing the tone of the show. So yeah, it&#039;s pretty grating and not very listenable. I have no issues with the voice acting - there are a few big name seiyuu&#039;s but none of the voices I heard left much of an impression.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the characters, I am not a fan either. Some of them have okay personalities, or at least personalities that clearly fit what archetype they should be. But the character comedy was weak. The tropes were set in stone and just sort of acted accordingly. This can be done well but the characters themselves were just not likeable for me. <br />
<br />
The teacher is forgettable and just sort of has no spine. He lacks personality. The sisters - I actually find all of them annoying. One is a real himedere, and likes seeing others suffer - but she&#039;s often downtrodden herself. Then there is the airheaded one who is also very strong. She is also mostly a nice person, but then is inconsiderate sometimes too? She had the most potential to be likeable, but between doing some physically gross things and just not being helpful I couldn&#039;t warm to her. The youngest sister is the worst. She&#039;s got a very dark aura, but not in a brilliant relate-able way like Tomoko Kuroki from Watamote for example. She&#039;s just sort of... terrible. A very unpleasant character. Other supporting characters are mostly forgettable and not likeable. The boys are pretty much just perverts which is... ugh. And there is the new school nurse who is just a ditz. In a very over-the-top and annoying way. She&#039;s absolutely useless, and it goes too far to be funny. I just wound up disliking her. She&#039;s also part of the most disgusting scene ever - let&#039;s just say it involves urine.<br />
<br />
Now I know it seems that I have been overly-critical of these 11-year old characters. After all, they are kids. Kids are supposed to be bratty. Well... Sure. But maybe in a less vulgar way? And maybe they shouldn&#039;t all be so consistently irritating? I&#039;m not saying they necessarily had to be cute, but they REALLY weren&#039;t cute. At all. They are about as un-cute as it gets. And yet, there are all of these swimming pool scenes, various scenes about getting a bra and boys being interested - I don&#039;t really like this aspect of it either. It felt weird to me. I know they aren&#039;t babies so it&#039;s not exactly unreasonable, but I just couldn&#039;t get enjoyment over that stuff that happens in the class at all. Again, a lot of this would be forgivable or maybe even a good thing if it was actually funny. But for me, it just wasn&#039;t.<br />
<br />
I may have touched on this, but my personal enjoyment was the problem here. It got barely a couple of chuckles out of me. I think I cringed more while watching it. The jokes were pretty predictable and never really caught me by surprise - except for when it got more unpleasant than I expected it to.<br />
<br />
Please by all means take this review with a pinch of salt from the fact that I&#039;ve seen so little of the show. But with these kinds of anime with no real plot, that is less of an issue that clouds judgement. I think this anime has too many overly-positive reviews, so just please be warned that this anime might not be as hilarious to you as some are painting it to be.

    This anime is a guilty pleasure of mine. While I didn&#039;t expect to like it at first, I ended up watching every episode of every season. And this is unusual for me. I would honestly compare this one to an anime version of South Park?? I say that because it&#039;s a bunch of children making sexual humor. The humor is what hooked me though. It&#039;s not JUST sexual humor. It&#039;s witty, clever, silly...I just really enjoyed this aspect of the show. What I disliked is the lack of character development and plot.

    I will have to agree with Bonta_kun with his review of this very hilarious anime.  I have been watching anime for 25 or so years and this is one of the funniest ones yet.  <br />
The Marui triplets are either dangerous or insane.  I feel sorry for their homeroom teacher that has to watch after them.  It is gag-based and it works.  Some animes just can&#039;t pull this off.<br />
The animation I thought is pretty good.  Note: I have seen some really bad animes in the past.  But that is the evolution of anime.<br />
I am only on episode 4 so

          <span style="display: none;" id="review29456">
        it could get worse.  We shall see in the next few months.<br />
Watch and enjoy.  Make sure you are eating or drinking anything while watching the exploits of the Marui triplets, you may just have to clean up a big mess.<br />

    I wanted to hate this.  I wanted to give this a &#039;3&#039;.  I wanted to shake my head at the smutty and toilet humour involving pre-teens.  I wanted to be self-righteous ...<br />
<br />
But I can&#039;t do it.  I can&#039;t because ... this is one of the funniest animes I have seen in a long, long while!<br />
<br />
You&#039;ll feel guilty laughing and you&#039;ll constantly look over your shoulder to make sure no one sees you but you wont be able to help it!<br />
<br />
This is a series that is probably best described as the messy end result after a car crash involving Minami-ke, Nichijou and

          <span style="display: none;" id="review95559">
        Kyou no Go no Ni.  It combines three sisters with hugely different personalities with zany comedy and light perversion in a elementary school setting.<br />
<br />
To say there is no plot would be an understatement but you wouldn&#039;t be looking for one if you were considering watching this in the first place.  What makes this series so humorous are the characters which are extreme to say the least!  The interactions of the three sisters with one another and the sensei will have you laughing out loud in every episode guaranteed.  It is further enriched with the varied support cast, all of whom contribute to the ridiculous comedy.  The situations are crude, bordering on criminal but just prevents it self from going too far.  I wont say too much for risk of spoiling it but watch a random episode and you will see what I mean. <br />
<br />
The show is further enhanced with the catchy opening theme, a rather surprising melodic ending theme and with the stellar seiyu cast including Haruka Tomatsu,  Hiro Shimono, Chiwa Saito and a cameo from the ever eternal Kikuko Inoue. <br />
<br />
This is a great series to watch if you want a break from the more serious series out there.  I&#039;ve watched it in between Bokurano and Monster, which has allowed me to slow my heart down a little!<br />
<br />
Highly recommended!

    Calling Mitsudomoe a &#039;masterpiece&#039; really doesn&#039;t seem... right. But for what it is, it&#039;s definitely a masterpiece. And just what is Mitsudome? It&#039;s your slice of life Anime; it follows the lives of &#039;ordinary&#039; people while throwing real life situations (well, exaggerated ones at least..) at you. I can honestly say that I was kept laughing well through EACH and every episode.<br />
<br />
Story? There&#039;s not much of a story. Though they do connect with each other slightly, each episode can be watched out of order, and it wouldn&#039;t take too long to catch on with what&#039;s going on. Seeing as it&#039;s a slice of life though,

          <span style="display: none;" id="review35247">
        I wouldn&#039;t take any regards to a story rating.<br />
<br />
The art worked well for it&#039;s genre. The little round faces just made everything all the funnier, while the girls never failed to put on an expression that would send me literally &#039;LOL&#039;ing at my computer screen. <br />
<br />
Sounds? Well, it&#039;s catchy. I love the voice actors, if it counts for any. The OP songs are incredibly cute and catchy -- you wouldn&#039;t expect to watch what you&#039;re going to watch from watching the OP. <br />
<br />
The characters are your stereotypical &#039;Tsundere&#039;, &#039;Airhead&#039;, and &#039;Silent&#039; type girls. ...While the males are strung about perverse characteristics (+the one popular boy). <br />
<br />
All this being said, Mitsudomoe is definitely high up on the enjoyment level. Whenever I&#039;m in need for a laugh, Mitsudomoe is there for me. :&#039;)

    Mitsudomoe!!!! This anime was so great i don&#039;t really know how to express it, well it made me a fanboy that&#039;s for sure, this is exactly what i want from Comedy anime, i laugh so much i had to pause to breath XD<br />
<br />
Art- 9/10<br />
<br />
The Art is great, it does not rely on the more realistic design approach, instead opting for the super cute, funny and scary, Hitoha scary scenes are so well done, then you have Futaba destruction scenes and rampage style witch was done so well.<br />
<br />
Characters- 9/10<br />
<br />
The Triplet Sisters are just AWESOME!!!! The youngest is dark and scary, socially awkward but cute and soft

          <span style="display: none;" id="review216320">
        on the inside, The middle sister is a pervert for boobs, so athletic that she can break walls but easy embarrassed, The eldest sister is sadistic, glutton but worried about her weight, and craves for attention. These combination makes for great and funny scenes that will make you laugh more than you possibly can.<br />
<br />
Overall/Enjoyment- 10/10<br />
<br />
Overall i had never laugh so much watching anything from movies to tv series, Mitsudomoe is Comedy non-stop, funny stuff one after another, i might be over-rating who knows and who cares it&#039;s comedy or you like it or you don&#039;t. So i totally recommend this to everyone.<br />
<br />

         Well what is there to say about Mitsudomoe........I LOVED IT!!<br />
Great anime. Now one of my favourites!<br />
<br />
     The whole show was great! I rated the &quot;story&quot; a five because, let&#039;s face it there is no story. Just the three Marui triplets enjoying their everyday life :) And their everyday life just so happens to be the funniest life ever!<br />
<br />
     Any ways, I HIGHLY recommend this anime. It&#039;s not for children obviously. But it&#039;s still awesome! Granted they are young, and a lot of ignorant people call it a &quot;lolicon&quot; anime even though they

          <span style="display: none;" id="review34729">
        haven&#039;t watched the show. JUST BECAUSE THEY&#039;RE CHILDREN DOESN&#039;T MAKE IT LOLICON! I mean seriously (-_-) people judge too quickly. Yes, they do draw them kind of erotically sometimes, but the overall script between characters is HILARIOUS. <br />
<br />
     Now, let&#039;s see....oh yes, the &quot;art&quot;. The &quot;art&quot; was really good. they made all the characters kawaii looking. It might only be me but I love the chibi style animes, they&#039;re just so cute! (^.^) Next is sound. Yes I loved the sound. All of it. The music, background noises and panning when necessary. I especially love the スイー  (Suiii) whenever Hitoha walks by and people stare at her! NEXT is characters. All the characters were amazing, all unique in their own way and all of them easy to remember. <br />
<br />
     Now my conclusion...Well I enjoyed this anime so much I rated it 10, but if the numbers went higher, I would go even higher than that! It was just such a funny show. Laughed so hard almost all the time!<br />
<br />
My overall rating is of course 10 &quot;Outstanding!&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope you all enjoyed my review! :)

    Teaches me the imporance of appearance. The dude literally got arrested for walking together with his daughters.<br />
<br />
Very enjoyable experience. Although most of the jokes come from misunderstandings and it can get repetitive, many times it serves as a continuation for the previous joke, so it&#039;s good in it&#039;s own way.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s not so many main characters that you wouldn&#039;t be able to recognize and each of them has their own specific trait. There&#039;s even character development when you look at the friendship aspect of this series.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, the art is cute and scary at the same time. I wasn&#039;t noticing obvious burnt marks too.<br />
<br />
The ost are

          <span style="display: none;" id="review411860">
        fun to the level where you can dance to it.<br />
<br />
Do watch it if you feel down.<br />
<br />
Ps. Sry for my English level (ﾉ≧ڡ≦)Teehee~!

    This anime was just awesome beyond beliefe which is why it scores a 10/10!<br />
<br />
Basically it is about adventures in the class room with the three sisters, their teacher and their classmates. Weird things happen and some of the greatest comedy I have ever seen pile up in this anime. I cannot get enough of it and is on my list of rewatch and recommend. Characters are great and the plot is pretty straight forward for a comedy. THUMBS UP!<br />
<br />
This is a must watch!

    THIS FUCKING SHOW OMG<br />
Let me start by telling you, Iv&#039;e seen my fair share of comedy anime from the satirical take of fantasy genre&#039;s like Konosuba, to the Slap stick comedies that is daily life of highschool boys. After watching watching TDLHB i thought there isnt anything funnier than this, im sure, But then i came across mitsudomoe.<br />
<br />
okay so right of the bat people looking at the synopsis are gonna think its some moe blob shit with a light hearted tale about these 3 triplets and their teacher. Well its not<br />
<br />
This anime is like the southpark of american television. It has no shame in talking

          <span style="display: none;" id="review255208">
        about panties, and bra&#039;s and straight forward sex jokes in the open without making it weird for the viewers. So if u like that sorta shit, this is for you<br />
<br />
Story: 7/10<br />
Its slice of life and comedy, although more comedy than slice of life, but what are you gonna expect. The plot itself is pretty basic, 3 crazy ass triplets in a class full of crazy ass people with a teacher. standard stuff<br />
<br />
Art: 7/10<br />
I really dont get why people hate on the art so much, its usually because of the type of art style, I think this type of art style perfectly suited the show. The animation was just as it should be to fit the basic comedy elements in it, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Those facial expressions tho<br />
<br />
Sound 7/10<br />
I did particularly like the ost for this series even though they were basic comedic ones. AND THAT 2ND OPENING OMG, its legit in my top ops ever.<br />
<br />
Character 10/10<br />
And damn do i like these characters. Mitsudomoe is primarily on how the characters act with one another in different situations. They&#039;ve all build unique relationships with each other so it makes it seem like you know them personally sometimes.<br />
So 1stly we have the triplets, Futoba, Hitoba and Mitsuba, all pretty likable with their own flaws.<br />
<br />
Futaba is the swwt naive one who has a HUGE interest in boobs and is oblivious to how taboo it really it. Shes physically strong and breaks alot of things<br />
<br />
Mitsuba is a sadistic fuck who eats alot and puts on weight. But when it counts she comes through and shows that she has emotions. <br />
<br />
And then theres Hitoba my literal favourite. I adore her relationship with the teacher Yabechi sensei, as their moments are my favourite in the show. I regret to say that there arent too many of them, but when there are, its down right the funniest thing. Hitoba at 1st glance looks like the quiet shy book worm, but her books to peoples surprise are ecchi magazines and she has this super creepy face when shes pissed so people dont get close to her<br />
<br />
All the other characters are pretty standard, the occult freak, the sass mcqueen, the hopeless romantic. Seeing them interact in different circumstances is what the highlight of this show it. <br />
<br />
Enjoyment 10/10<br />
I usually dont put series into my top favorites as im very critical about them, and my favourite shows usually just stems from the ones i watched long ago, so its difficult to find anything close. But Mitsudomoe now has a special place in my hear. Not one episode went by where i lmao&#039;d on the fucking floor, it legitimate hurt. Now im not saying everyone should laugh, but I really doubt there wont be moments where you at least chuckle<br />
<br />
Comedy 10/10<br />
Now obviously the best part of this series is the comedy. Yabechi&#039;s hopeless single life as a virgin, Kotoba&#039;s obsession with boobs, the occult freak, the mauriu&#039;s dad who gets arrested every time bc he looks shady af, the dumbass nurse, the fact that everyone almost bleeds to dead whenever they get injured. Its all part of the package. The jokes arent predictable, they slowly take you through it and surprise you with a twist. Most of the comedy here although comes form misunderstandings, some repetitive but some just downright unique and hilarious. <br />
<br />
Overall 10/10<br />
Mitsudomoe is the stupidest most random best thing ive ever discovered this year, and Im so glad I did. I finished 2 seasons in one day and Now i dont know what to do with my life. I desperately tried to find shows which are similar but had no luck. I hope in the future we get comedy golds as this show and it bring as much happiness to others as it did for me<br />
<br />
If you love your comedy anime, and even if you dont, I desperatly urge you to watch this series. It pains me to see that its not as high up as shows like Nichijou (Although personally i like mitsudomoe better oops)<br />
<br />

    Don&#039;t let the kiddy-looking kids fool you. This anime is about the adventures of the Marui triplets in sixth grade and their newly hired teacher who often gets pushed around by these girls into trouble which leaves the audience laughing till their stomach hurts. The oldest one, Mitsuba, is sadistic and kind of mature for her age. The middle one, Futaba, is perverted and very athletic and has the strength of a full-grown man. The youngest one, Hitoha, is generally very quiet and gentle but when push comes to shove, she might just be the strongest, the most perverted and the most sadistic out of

          <span style="display: none;" id="review243364">
        the three. Though rated for middle ages, the anime encloses adult jokes and requires certain mind set to enjoy. Each episode is divided into different joke scenarios roughly connected within that episode.<br />
<br />
It seems that MCs of Mitsudomoe has slight resemblence with that of K-ON! in terms of appearance and behaviour.<br />
<br />
Story: 6.2/10 Not much of a story, but family relations got my attention. <br />
<br />
Art: 4/10 Not much texture or character design. The kids look like they are in class 3. But the funny effects, stunned pos,camera angles, blood, drool, etc all adds to the comedic punch.<br />
<br />
Soundtrack: 7/10 The anime has well made audio FX which uplifts and adds power to the awesome voice acting. This makes the humorous scenes heavily enjoyable. The opening being kiddish and very catchy is apt for this anime.<br />
<br />
MC: 9/10 I loved the triplets for they make the show really enjoyable. The voice acting suits the character animations. They are well defined and unique.<br />
<br />
Worth watching?: Depends on what category of jokes you can enjoy. Watching a single episode can help make that decision.

    I really wonder how you should raise kids to make them turn out like the main characters of Mitsudomoe. They all have funny personalities, one&#039;s more original than the other but definitely good enough to make you laugh.<br />
<br />
The story&#039;s good but it still just a school anime. It&#039;s the combination of the teacher, nurse and students which makes the plot so good.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a series with more misunderstandings and it&#039;s hilarious.<br />
<br />
The art is really fitting. Especially some effects. The opening&#039;s done quite good as well.<br />
<br />
Mitsudomoe is really enjoyable. It wouldn&#039;t be the first anime I&#039;d recommend but I would eventually. Some

    I watched this anime because on another website it said it was a romance... I quickly found it it wasn&#039;t. This show is a perfect storm of comedy and cuteness, and when I say cuteness, I don&#039;t mean moe.<br />
<br />
Story ~9/10~<br />
Well, there really isn&#039;t a story to this anime, at the end of the second season they tried to put in a story-ender (and they did successfully), but there was really no story to end. The show doesn&#039;t carry and underlying plot, it&#039;s more of a random slice of life about three triplets who are going through many new experiences from maturity to immature actions. I

          <span style="display: none;" id="review42895">
        didn&#039;t know sixth grade was so hilarious.<br />
<br />
Art ~8/10~<br />
The art isn&#039;t genre defining, but I like how the artists put in many different colors throughout each episode and because they did that, the situations often felt unique and worth continuing to watch.<br />
<br />
Sound ~10/10~<br />
This is where I was most impressed. When watching this, I could easily see how much effort the voice actors/actresses had put into this show. The music was great, the dialogue was great, but I didn&#039;t get the feeling that the Japanese used by these sixth graders were easy to understand, as if a lot of the show was more adult oriented.<br />
<br />
Character ~8/10~<br />
The characters are not unique, but how these three triplets interact with each other does seem unique to me. One is a loud mouth who yells and commands respect, but her fatal flaw is here bad luck and weight concerns. The other is a dumb, blunt-athletic girl who often says things out of context very loudly and who&#039;s fatal flaw is a boob obsession. And finally the third and youngest triplet who is smart, but not social and her fatal flaw is a porn obsession, she&#039;ll sit there reading her porn magazines (with a fake book cover) all day during class.<br />
<br />
Those are some twisted kids.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i fully enjoyed this anime. There was only a few moments were I wasn&#039;t rolling on the floor, but otherwise, the show was nearly perfect when it came to the comedy aspect.
